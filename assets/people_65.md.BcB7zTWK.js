Havemann joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1932 and was one of the founders of the resistance group, European Union. It was in connection with this group that he was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943. He received a death sentence, but his execution was continually postponed because of the intervention of former colleagues, who insisted that Havemann was as important as his work on chemical weapons had been and that he was still needed to explain the research. His execution was postponed so many times, he was able to survive until the Brandenburg-G√∂rden Prison was liberated by the Red Army.Bernd Florath. \\"Die Europ√§ische Union,\\" essay in Johannes Tuchel, Der vergessene Widerstand ‚Äî zu Realgeschichte und Wahrnehmung des Kampfes gegen die NS-Diktatur, pp. 114-139.

Brown was born in Holliston, Massachusetts, and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1883. Brown preached in various cities throughout the United States, including Portland, Oregon and Oak Park, Illinois from 1883 to 1895. Often termed a \\"missionary statesman,\\" Brown traveled throughout the world‚Äîmost notably in China and other Asian countries. During the time Brown surveyed China, he wrote a seventeen-volume diary of what he'd seen and discovered. Over time, Brown communicated with Roman Catholic, Jewish, and Greek Orthodox leaders, in addition to such influential Protestant clergymen as Henry Sloane Coffin, Nathan S√∂derblom, and John R. Mott. Brown himself received letters from five American Presidents and various other government officials. Booker T. Washington, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (1839‚Äì1937), and John Wanamaker were among his famous American correspondents. In addition, members of European and Asian royalty, including Chinese general and emperor, Yuan Shih-kai, were in communication with Brown. Overall, Brown will be remembered as a pioneer in the ecumenical and world missionary movements of the 19th and 20th centuries and was an individual who was active in and out of the church. He served in a plethora of notable positions. The following is a lengthy chronology of Brown's achievements and activities. During this time Brown also preached at various churches.

Ad√©mar de Chabannes (sometimes Adh√©mar de Chabannes) (c. 9891034Landes (1995, 77).) was an eleventh-century French monk, a historian, a musical composer and a successful literary forger. Life Ad√©mar was born at Chabannes, a village in today's Haute-Vienne d√©partement of France. Educated at the Abbey Saint- Martial de Limoges, he passed his life as a monk, both there and at the monastery of Saint-Cybard at Angoul√™me. Ad√©mar died around 1034, most probably at Jerusalem, where he had gone on a pilgrimage. Writings The intonation formulas for the 8 tones according to the Aquitanian tonary, which has been partly notated by Ad√©mar (F-Pn lat. 909, fol. 151r-154r) When Ad√©mar joined the Abbey Saint Martial of Limoges, he was educated by his uncle Roger de Chabannes, cantor of the Abbey between 1010 until his death in 1025.James Grier (2006). Ad√©mar learned calligraphy, to read, to compose and to notate liturgical chant, to compile and to revise liturgical books, and to compose and to write liturgical poetry, homilies, chronicles and hagiography.James Grier (1995). His life was mainly spent in writing and transcribing chant books and chronicles, and his principal work is a history entitled Chronicon Aquitanicum et Francicum or Historia Francorum. This is in three books and deals with Frankish history from the reign of Pharamond, king of the Franks, to 1028. The first two books are scarcely more than a copy of earlier histories of Frankish kings, such as the Liber Historiae Francorum, the Continuation of Fredegar and the Annales regni Francorum. The third book, which deals with the period from 814 to 1028, is of considerable historical importance. It relies partly on the Chronicon Aquitanicum, to which Ad√©mar himself added a final notice for the year 1028. Forgery He embraced the developing tale that Saint Martial, the third century bishop who Christianized the Limoges district, had actually lived centuries earlier, and was in fact one of the original apostles. And he supplemented the less than scanty documentation for the alleged 'apostolicity' of Martial, first with a forged Life of Martial, as if composed by Martial's successor, Bishop Aurelian. To effect this claim, he composed an \\"Apostolic Mass\\" that still exists in Ad√©mar's own hand (F-Pn lat. 1121, ff. 28v-32v). The local bishop and abbot seem to have cooperated in the project and the mass was first sung on Sunday, August 3, 1029.See James Grier's entry for \\"Ad√©mar de Chabannes\\" in the New Grove Dictionary. Unfortunately for Ad√©mar, the liturgy was disrupted by a travelling monk, Benedict of Chiusa, who denounced the improved Vita of Martial as a provincial forgery and the new liturgy as offensive to God. The word spread, and the promising young monk was disgraced. Ad√©mar's reaction was to build forgery upon forgery, inventing a Council of 1031 that confirmed the 'apostolic' status of Martial, even a forged papal letter. The reality of this pathological tissue of forgeries was only unravelled in the 1920s, by a historian, Louis Saltet. Mainstream Catholic historians ignored Saltet's revelations until the 1990s. In the long run, Ad√©mar was successful. By the late 11th century, Martial was indeed venerated in Aquitaine as an apostle, though his legend was doubted elsewhere. In a very direct way, Ad√©mar's Mass shows the power of liturgy to effect worship. Works and legacy Ad√©mar composed his musical Mass and office according to the local school of his uncle Roger who worked as a cantor between 1010 until his death in 1025 at St. Martial Abbey using those modal patterns, as they have been documented in the tonaries of the new troper-prosers (F-Pn lat. 1121, 909), chant books to which Ad√©mar had partly contributed as a notator. Concerning the Apostolic feast of the patron he composed as well the hymns as the music which had become the metier of a cantor at Saint Martial. For this liturgical occasion which he had to create, he contributed like other cantors with own compositions, especially in the tropes (extended musical items added to existing liturgical texts). According to James Grier, Professor of Music History in the Don Wright Faculty of Music at the University of Western Ontario, Ad√©mar was the first person to write music using the musical notation still in use today. He placed the musical notes above the text, higher or lower according to the pitch. Professor Grier states that \\"Placement on the vertical axis remains the standard convention for indicating pitch in notation in Western culture and there is far greater weight on pitch than on many other elements such as dynamics and timbre\\". Therefore, in discovering this document written around 1000 years in the past, Professor Grier turns Ad√©mar in one of the first‚Äîif not the first‚Äîto write music using \\"modern\\" notation.

Instead of negatives and prints, reversal film is processed to produce transparencies or diapositives . Reversal film is produced in various sizes, from 35 mm to roll film to 8√ó10 inch sheet film. A slide is a specially mounted individual transparency intended for projection onto a screen using a slide projector. This allows the photograph to be viewed by a large audience at once. The most common form is the 35 mm slide, with the image framed in a 2√ó2 inch cardboard or plastic mount. Some specialized labs produce photographic slides from digital camera images in formats such as JPEG, from computer-generated presentation graphics, and from a wide variety of physical source material such as fingerprints, microscopic sections, paper documents, astronomical images, etc. Reversal film is sometimes used as motion picture film, mostly in the 16 mm, Super 8 and 8 mm \\"cine\\" formats, to yield a positive image on the camera original. This avoids the expense of using negative film, which requires additional film and processing to create a positive film print for projection. History =Additive method= The earliest practical and commercially successful color photography reversal process was the Lumi√®re Autochrome, introduced in 1907. This was an additive method, using a panchromatic emulsion coated on a thin glass plate previously coated with a layer of dyed potato starch grains. Autochrome plates were discontinued in the 1930s, Various print and online sources offer discontinuation dates ranging from 1932 to 1938. after the introduction of Lumi√®re Filmcolor in sheet film and Lumicolor in roll film sizes. Also using the additive principle and reversal processing were the Agfa color screen plates and films and Dufaycolor film, all of which were discontinued by 1961. =Subtractive methods= Leopold Godowsky, Jr. and Leopold Mannes, working with the Eastman Kodak Company, developed Kodachrome, the first commercially successful color film to use the subtractive method. Kodachrome was introduced in 1935 as 16mm motion picture film, and in 1936 as 35mm film for still cameras. The Kodachrome films contained no color dye couplers; these were added during processing. In late 1936, Agfacolor Neu was launched, Agfa having overcome earlier difficulties with color sensitivity problems. This film had the dye couplers incorporated into the emulsion, making processing simpler than for Kodachrome. Early color negative film had many shortcomings, including the high cost of the film, processing and printing, the mediocre color quality, rapid fading and discoloration of highlightshttp://www.preservation101.org/session2/expl_iv_cs-photo_cd.asp shows examples of the severe yellowing eventually produced by this staining and briefly explains the cause. This was a problem with early Kodacolor prints. of some types of print that became noticeable after several years. Amateurs who owned projection equipment used reversal films extensively because the cost of projection equipment and slide film was offset by not having to pay for prints. Eventually, print quality improved and prices decreased, and, by the 1970s, color negative film and color prints had largely displaced slides as the primary method of amateur photography. Until about 1995, color transparency was preferred for publication because of the films' higher contrast and resolution, and was widely used in commercial and advertising photography, reportage, sports, stock and nature photography. Digital media gradually replaced transparency film. Film types All color reversal film sold today is developed with the E-6 process. The non- substantive Kodachrome films, the last of which was discontinued in 2009, were processed with the K-14 process. Polaroid produced an instant slide film called Polachrome. It was packaged in cassettes like normal 35mm film. A separate processing unit was used to develop it after exposure. =Black and white= Picture of a boat taken on Fomapan R 100 black-and-white reversal film Black-and-white transparencies can be made directly with some modern black-and-white films, which normally yield negatives. The negative image is developed but not fixed. The negative image is removed by bleaching with a solution of potassium permanganate or potassium dichromate in dilute sulfuric acid, which is removed by washing and a clearing bath containing sodium metabisulfite or potassium metabisulfite. The remaining silver halide salts are re-exposed to light, developed and fixed, and the film is washed and dried. Black-and-white transparencies were once popular for presentation of lecture materials using 3¬º\\"√ó4\\" (3¬º\\" square in the UK) glass-mounted slides. Such positive black-and-white projection is now rarely done, except in motion pictures. Even where black-and-white positives are currently used, the process to create them typically uses an internegative with standard processing instead of a chemical reversal process. Black-and-white reversal films are less common than color reversal films. *Agfa-Gevaert discontinued its Agfa Scala 200x Professional black-and-white reversal film. This could be developed with their proprietary Scala process. *The Adox company released Scala 160 In 2017 , A black and white reversal film based on Agfa's discontinued Scala. *The Foma company of the Czech Republic produces one of only remaining dedicated black-and-white reversal film for 35 mm stills, Fomapan R 100, which is also available in movie film formats. *Kodak & Foma currently produce kits for reversal processing. *Kodak formerly offered a kit (\\"Direct Positive Film Developing Outfit\\") for reversal processing of its now-discontinued Panatomic X film, which doubled the effective film speed from 32 to 64. The bleaching bath used potassium dichromate and sodium bisulfate; the redeveloper was a fogging developer, and so unstable that its shelf-life after mixing was only slightly longer than the amount of time needed to process a single roll. This was replaced with a \\"T-Max Direct Positive Film Developing Outfit\\", which uses potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid in the bleach. In this kit, the fogging redeveloper is stable, but the bleach is not, with a shelf-life, once mixed, of no more than two weeks. *dr5 Chrome process, which produces black- and-white transparencies from most traditional halide (i.e., non-chromogenic) black-and-white negative films. * Kodak Tri-X Reversal Film 7266 and Kodak Plus-X Reversal Film 7265 are black-and-white reversal films used for movie- making. *Ilford has published a reversal process applicable to all current B&W; emulsions, but recommended for Pan F+, FP4+, and Delta 100.  Pros and cons  Film scanner = Pros = * Shows what exactly was captured on film without printing. * More accurate color translation when digitizing. There is no need for color inversion processes. http://www.sebastian- schlueter.com/blog/2015/8/27/understanding-color-negtaive-film-for-scanning * Much faster digitizing on professional scanner machines. https://services.ezphotoscan.com/negative-scanning-vs-print-scanning-which-is- better/ * In general, slide film produces much more vibrant colours than negative film. = Cons = * Generally fewer stops of exposure latitude when compared to colour negative film. * Lower film speeds than color negative. * Typically higher priced. Uses Slide projector Leitz Prado =Viewing= Finished transparencies are most frequently displayed by projection. Some projectors use a sliding mechanism to manually pull the transparency out of the side of the machine, where it is replaced by the next image. Modern, advanced projectors typically use a carousel that holds a large number of slides; a mechanism automatically pulls a single slide from the carousel and places it in front of the lamp. Small externally lit or battery-powered magnifying viewers are available. In traditional newsrooms and magazine offices slides were viewed using a lightbox and a loupe, this allowed rapid side by side comparison of similar images. = Slide copier = A slide copier is a simple optical device that can be fastened to the lens mount of a camera to enable slide duplicates to be made. Whilst these devices were formerly used to make duplicates on to slide film, they are often now used in conjunction with digital cameras to digitize images from film-based transparencies. This method usually gives better resolution than using attachments for digital A4 flat-bed scanners.

He has been declared a saint by the Catholic Church.Joseph Freinademetz (1852-1908)CANONIZATION OF THREE BLESSEDS Early life Freinademetz was born the fourth among the 13 children of Giovanmattia and Anna Maria FreinademetzJoseph Freinademetz - Serving the People of China in Oies, a section of the town of Badia, which was then in the County of Tyrol, a part of the Austrian Empire, now a part of Italy. He studied theology in the diocesan seminary of Brixen and was ordained a priest on July 25, 1875. He was assigned to the community of San Martin de Tor, not far from his own home. During his studies and the three years in San Martino, Freinademetz always felt a calling to be a missionary. He contacted Arnold Janssen, founder of the Society of the Divine Word, a missionary congregation based in Steyl, Netherlands. With the permission of his parents and his bishop, he moved to Steyl in August 1878, where he received training as a missionary. Missionary work In March 1879, he and his confrere Johann Baptist von Anzer boarded a ship to Hong Kong, where they arrived five weeks later. They stayed there for two years. Freinademetz was based in Sai Kung Peninsula until 1880Humble Beginnings on Yim Tin Tsai and set up a chapel on the island of Yim Tin Tsai in 1879.Yim Tin Tsai Village and St. Joseph's Chapel In 1881 they moved to the southern region of the Province of Shantung, to which they had been assigned. At the time of their arrival, there were 12 million people living in that province, of which 158 had been baptized. Freinademetz was very active in the education of Chinese laymen and priests. He wrote a catechism in Chinese, which he considered a crucial part of their missionary effort. In 1898, he was sick with laryngitis and tuberculosis, so Anzer, who had become the bishop of the region, and other priests convinced him to go to Japan to recuperate. He returned, but was still not fully cured. When Anzer had to leave China for a journey to Europe in 1907, the administration of the diocese was assigned to Freinademetz.

It covers the City and County of San Francisco and the Counties of Marin and San Mateo. The Archdiocese of San Francisco was canonically erected on July 29, 1853, by Pope Pius IX and its cathedral is the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption. This archdiocese is the metropolitan see of a province which also has the dioceses of Honolulu (Hawaii), Las Vegas (Nevada), Reno (Nevada), Salt Lake City (Utah), Oakland (California), San Jose (California), Santa Rosa (California), Sacramento (California), and Stockton (California). History The first church in the Archdiocese of San Francisco is older than the Archdiocese itself; Mission San Francisco de As√≠s was founded on June 29, 1776 by Franciscan Friars. The mission church that stands today was completed in 1791 and attached next door is Mission Dolores Basilica. The Franciscans who founded the mission also are credited with naming the City and County of San Francisco, and the entire region, after their patron, Saint Francis of Assisi. From his installation on February 15, 2006, until the acceptance of his resignation on July 27, 2012, the archdiocese was led by Archbishop (now Emeritus) George Hugh Niederauer, formerly the bishop of the Diocese of Salt Lake City. The auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese was William J. Justice; until his retirement in November 2017. Robert W. McElroy was auxiliary bishop from 2010 to 2015 before leaving to become Bishop of San Diego. On July 27, 2012, the Holy See announced that it had accepted the retirement of Niederauer and appointed Salvatore J. Cordileone as new archbishop of San Francisco, installed on October 4, 2012, the patronal Feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi at the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption.catholicnews.com He had previously been Bishop of Oakland, California. The See of San Francisco is administered by the Archbishop of San Francisco, who as metropolitan oversees the entire ecclesiastical province of San Francisco. Its suffragans include the Dioceses of Honolulu, Las Vegas, Oakland, Reno, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Jose, Santa Rosa, and Stockton. San Francisco once included among its suffragans the now-Metropolitan Archdiocese of Aga√±a, Guam and the former dioceses of Grass Valley, Roman Catholic Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego, Monterey, Monterey- Fresno, and Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles. The Chancellery Office of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, originally located in 1853 at California and Dupont Streets, moved in 1891 to 1100 Franklin Street, in 1955 re-located to 445 Church Street, on the Mission Dolores Basilica property. The present headquarters, as of 2001 of the Archdiocese of San Francisco are located at One Peter Yorke Way, a short street in San Francisco named after Father Peter Yorke, an Irish-American Catholic priest. Peter Yorke Way and Starr King Way are off of Geary Street as it becomes Geary Boulevard. From May to December 2019, the Archdiocese of San Francisco provided numerous documents to California State Attorney Xavier Becerra in preparation for a series of pending lawsuits which are expected to be filed after a new California law which will temporarily remove the statute of limitations goes into effect on January 1, 2020.https://ktla.com/2019/12/10/half-of-californias-catholic- dioceses-to-be-subpoenaed-in-priest-abuse- inquiry/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/11/california-catholic- dioceses-subpoenas-sexual-abuse-investigation The Archdiocese of San Francisco is one of six Catholic dioceses throughout the state of California which is expected to be subpoenaed in the upcoming lawsuits.

An improved version entered service as M5. It was supplied to British and other Commonwealth forces under lend-lease prior to the entry of the U.S. into the war. Thereafter, it was used by U.S. and Allied forces until the end of the war. The British service name \\"Stuart\\" came from the American Civil War Confederate general J. E. B. Stuart and was used for both the M3 and the derivative M5 Light Tank. In U.S. use, the tanks were officially known as \\"Light Tank M3\\" and \\"Light Tank M5\\". Stuarts were the first American-crewed tanks in World War II to engage the enemy in tank versus tank combat.Hunnicutt (Stuart) p. 395Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 301 The Stuart was also the light tank counterpart of the M3 Lee, which was a medium tank. Development Observing events in Europe and Asia during World War II, American tank designers realized that the Light Tank M2 was becoming obsolete and set about improving it. The upgraded design, with thicker armor, modified suspension and new gun recoil system was called \\"Light Tank M3\\". Production of the vehicle started in March 1941 and continued until October 1943. Like its direct predecessor, the M2A4, the M3 was initially armed with a 37 mm M5 gun and five .30-06 Browning M1919A4 machine guns: coaxial with the gun, on top of the turret in an M20 anti-aircraft mount, in a ball mount in right bow, and in the right and left hull sponsons. Later, the gun was replaced with the slightly longer M6, and the sponson machine guns were removed. For a light tank, the Stuart was fairly heavily armored. It had 38 mm of armor on the upper front hull, 44 mm on the lower front hull, 51 mm on the gun mantlet, 38 mm on the turret sides, 25 mm on the hull sides, and 25 mm on the hull rear.Zaloga 1999, p. 31A M3 going through water obstacle, Ft. Knox, Ky. The M3 and M3A1 variants were powered by an air-cooled radial engine, either a gasoline-fueled 7-cylinder Continental W-670 (8,936 built) or a 9-cylinder Guiberson T-1020 diesel (1,496 built).Hunnicutt (Stuart) p. 127 and p. 153 Both of these powerplants were originally developed as aircraft engines. Internally, the radial engine was at the rear and the transmission at the front of the tank's hull. The propeller shaft connecting the engine and transmission ran through the middle of the fighting compartment. The radial engine's crankshaft was positioned high off the hull bottom and contributed to the tank's relatively tall profile. When a revolving turret floor was introduced in the M3 hybrid and M3A1, the crew had less room. A further 3,427 M3A3 variants were built with modified hull (similar to the M5), new turret and the Continental W-670 gasoline engine.Hunnicutt (Stuart) p. 164 In contrast to the M2A4, all M3/M5 series tanks had a trailing rear idler wheel for increased ground contact. =M5 Stuart= 761st Tank Battalion, stand by awaiting call to clean out scattered German machine gun nests in Coburg, Germany To relieve wartime demand for the radial aero-engines used in the M3, a new version was developed using twin Cadillac V8 automobile engines and twin Hydra-Matic transmissions operating through a transfer case. This version of the tank was quieter, cooler and roomier; the automatic transmission also simplified crew training. The new model (initially called M4 but redesignated M5 to avoid confusion with the M4 ShermanZaloga (M3/M5 Stuart) p. 17) featured a redesigned hull with a raised rear deck over the engine compartment, sloped glacis plate and driver's hatches moved to the top. Although the main criticism from units using the Stuarts was that it lacked firepower, the improved M5 series kept the same 37 mm gun. The M5 gradually replaced the M3 in production from 1942 and, after the M7 project proved unsatisfactory, was succeeded by the Light Tank M24 in 1944. Total M5 and M5A1 tank production was 8,885; an additional 1,778 M8 75 mm howitzer motor carriages based on the M5 chassis with an open-top turret were produced. Combat history Light Tank M5A1 passes through the wrecked streets of Coutances. assault on Buna. A British M3 (Stuart I) knocked out during fighting in North Africa. =War in North Africa and Europe= British and other Commonwealth armies were the first to use the Light Tank M3, as the \\"Stuart\\", in combat.Hunnicutt (Stuart) p. 391 From mid-November 1941 to the end of the year, about 170 Stuarts (in a total force of over 700 tanks) took part in Operation Crusader during the North Africa Campaign, with poor results. This is despite the fact that the M3 was superior or comparable in most regards to most of the tanks used by the Axis forces. The most numerous German tank, the Panzer III Ausf G, had nearly identical armor and speed to the M3,the M3 actually had thicker front and turret armor, while the Panzer III had slightly thicker side armor and both tanks' guns could penetrate the other tank's front armor from beyond .Zaloga 1999, p. 10 The most numerous Italian tank (and second most numerous Axis tank overall), the Fiat M13/40, was much slower than the Stuart, had slightly weaker armor all around, and could not penetrate the Stuart's front hull or turret armor at 1,000 meters, whereas the Stuart's gun could penetrate any spot on the M13/40. Although the high losses suffered by Stuart-equipped units during the operation had more to do with the better tactics and training of the Afrika Korps than the apparent superiority of German armored fighting vehicles used in the North African campaign,Zaloga (M3/M5 Stuart) p. 10 the operation revealed that the M3 had several technical faults. Mentioned in the British complaints were the 37 mm M5 gun and poor internal layout. The two-man turret crew was a significant weakness, and some British units tried to fight with three-man turret crews. The Stuart also had a limited range, which was a severe problem in the highly mobile desert warfare as units often outpaced their supplies and were stranded when they ran out of fuel. On the positive side, crews liked its relatively high speed and mechanical reliability, especially compared to the Crusader tank,Zaloga (M3/M5 Stuart) p. 9-12Hunnicutt (Stuart) p. 391-394 which comprised a large portion of the British tank force in Africa up until 1942. The Crusader had similar armament and armor to the Stuart while being slower, less reliable, and several tons heavier. The Stuart also had the advantage of a gun that could deliver high-explosive shells; HE shells were not available for the QF 2 pdr mounted by most Crusaders, severely limiting their use against emplaced anti-tank guns or infantry;.Ian Hogg, Tank Killing, page 138-139, published 1996 by Sidgwick & Jackson however, by late 1942, the Crusader received the QF 6 pdr gun, significantly improving its anti-tank characteristics and giving it HE capability The main drawback of the Stuart was its low fuel capacity and range; its operational range was only 75 miles (cross country), roughly half that of the Crusader. In the summer of 1942, the British usually kept Stuarts out of tank-to-tank combat, using them primarily for reconnaissance. The turret was removed from some examples to save weight and improve speed and range. These became known as \\"Stuart Recce\\". Some others were converted to armored personnel carriers known as the \\"Stuart Kangaroo\\", and some were converted into command vehicles and known as \\"Stuart Command\\". M3s, M3A3s, and M5s continued in British service until the end of the war, but British units had a smaller proportion of these light tanks than U.S. units. The other major Lend-Lease recipient of the M3, the Soviet Union, was less happy with the tank, considering it under-gunned, under-armored, likely to catch fire, and too sensitive to fuel quality. The M3's radial aircraft engine required high-octane fuel, which complicated Soviet logistics as most of their tanks used diesel or low-octane fuel. High fuel consumption led to a poor range characteristic, especially sensitive for use as a reconnaissance vehicle. Also, compared to Soviet tanks, the M3's narrower tracks resulted in a higher ground pressure, getting them more easily stuck in the spring and autumn mud and winter snow conditions on the Eastern Front. In 1943, the Red Army tried out the M5 and decided that the upgraded design was not much better than the M3. Being less desperate than in 1941, the Soviets turned down an American offer to supply the M5. M3s continued in Red Army service at least until 1944. Anzio One of the more successful uses of the M5 in combat came during the Battle of Anzio when breaking through German forces surrounding the beachhead. The tactics called for an initial breakthrough by a medium tank company to destroy the heavier defenses, followed by an infantry battalion who would attack the German troops who were being left behind the medium tanks. Since many hidden fortifications and positions would have survived the initial medium tank assault, the infantry would then be confronted by any remaining fortified German troops. Behind the infantry came the M5s of a light tank company, who would attack these positions when directed to by the Infantry, usually by the use of green Smoke grenade.Training memorandum number 2: lessons from the Italian Campaign, page 47 of 162, March 1945 =Pacific and Asia= Republic of China army operating the M3A3 Stuart on Ledo RoadAustralian assault on pillbox, January 1943, Papua, Giropa Point The U.S. Army initially deployed 108 Stuart light tanks to the Philippines in September 1941, equipping the U.S. Army's 194th and 192nd Tank Battalions. The first U.S. tank versus tank combat to occur in World War II, began on 22 December 1941, when a platoon of five M3s led by Lieutenant Ben R. Morin engaged the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) 4th Tank Regiment's Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks north of Damortis. Lt. Morin, with his 37mm cannon locked in recoil maneuvered his M3 off the road, but took a direct hit while doing so, and his tank began to burn. The other four M3s were also hit, but managed to leave the field under their own power. Lt. Morin was wounded, and he and his crew were captured by the enemy.Hunnicutt (Stuart) p. 395 & 396 M3s of the 194th and 192nd Tank Battalions continued to skirmish with the 4th Tank Regiment's tanks as they continued their retreat down the Bataan Peninsula, with the last tank versus tank combat occurring on 7 April 1942.Zaloga, (M3/M5 Stuart) p. 13, 14Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 301 & 302 Due to the naval nature of the Pacific campaign, steel for warship production took precedence over tanks for the IJA,Zaloga (Japanese Tanks) p. 15 creating by default an IJA light tank that performed admirably in the jungle terrain of the South Pacific. By the same measure, although the US was not hampered by industrial restrictions, the U.S. M3 light tank proved to be an effective armored vehicle for fighting in jungle environments.Zaloga (M3/M5 Stuart) p. 33 At least one was captured in the Philippines.Captured Stuart With the IJA's drive toward India within the South-East Asian theatre of World War II, the United Kingdom hastily withdrew their 2nd Royal Tank Regiment and 7th Hussars Stuart tank units (which also contained some M2A4 light tanksHunnicutt (Stuart) p.396) from North Africa, and deployed them against the Japanese 14th Tank Regiment. By the time the Japanese had been stopped at Imphal, only one British Stuart remained operational.Zaloga When the U.S. entered the war in 1941, it began to supply China with AFVs, including M3 Stuarts, and later M4 Sherman medium tanks and M18 Hellcat tank destroyers, which trickled in through Burma. Although the U.S. light tanks had proven effective in jungle warfare, by late 1943, U.S. Marine Corps tank battalions were transitioning from their M3/M5 light tanks to M4 medium tanks, mostly for the much greater high-explosive blast effect of the M4's 75mm gun, which fired a much larger shell with a heavier explosive payload.Zaloga (M3/M5 Stuart) p. 34 =Usage= When the U.S. Army joined the North African Campaign in late 1942, Stuart units still formed a large part of its armor strength. After the disastrous Battle of Kasserine Pass, the U.S. quickly followed the British in disbanding most of their light tank battalions and subordinating the Stuarts to medium tank battalions performing the traditional cavalry missions of scouting and screening. For the rest of the war, most U.S. tank battalions had three companies of M4 Shermans and one company of M3s or M5/M5A1s. A Marine Captain inspects an un-exploded Type 99 mine attached to his M3A1 Stuart during the Battle of Munda Point in August, 1943 In Europe, Allied light tanks had to be given cavalry and infantry fire support roles since their main cannon armament could not compete with heavier enemy armored fighting vehicles. However, the Stuart was still effective in combat in the Pacific Theater, as Japanese tanks were both relatively rare and were lighter in armor than even Allied light tanks.Hunnicutt (Stuart) p. 475 M2A4 had 1\\" thick armor/p. 478 M3 had 1\\" thick armorZaloga (Japanese Tanks) p. 29 plate D, Type 95 had 12 mm thick armor Japanese infantrymen were not well equipped with anti-tank weapons, and as such had to use close assault tactics. In this environment, the Stuart was only moderately more vulnerable than medium tanks. Though the Stuart was to be completely replaced by the newer M24 Chaffee, the number of M3s/M5s produced was so great (over 25,000 including the 75mm HMC M8) that the tank remained in service until the end of the war, and well after. In addition to the U.S, UK and Soviet Union, who were the primary users, it was also used by France (M3A3 and M5A1), China (M3A3s and, immediately post-war, M5A1s) and Josip Broz Tito's Partisans in Yugoslavia (M3A3s and few M3A1). With the limitations of both the main gun (see below) and armor, the Stuart's combat role in Western Europe was severely hampered. Light tank companies were often paired with cavalry reconnaissance units, or else used for guarding or screening, and even used in supply or messengers roles for medium tank units.At approximately 1720 hours on June 1st (the light tank) company... was called upon to move to the vicinity of 032465 (Velletri) to form an armored guard for the 85th Division C.P.. Three other light tanks of the company were used as liaison between the medium tanks companies of the regimental command post. This use of light tanks proved to be the most effective way of maintaining communication between the tanks and infantry regimental headquarters. 760th tank Battalion, page 108 of 135, Ike Skelton Combined Arms Research Library Digital Library  Limitations of the 37mm gun  On 9 December 1944, the 759th Tank Battalion advanced on a hill near Bogheim but was subjected to a counter-attack by German forces, including a heavy self-propelled assault gun, which took \\"over 100 direct hits\\" at ranges as low as with \\"no appreciable damage\\". In January 1945, a report to General Eisenhower concluded that the Stuart was \\"obsolete in every respect as a fighting tank\\" and that it would not \\"turn the German fire or the 37mm gun damage the German tanks or SP guns\\". =Post World War II use= M3A3 in Chinese Civil War, 1949. ROC M5A1 tank with placard reading \\"The Bear of Kinmen\\". After the war, some countries chose to equip their armies with cheap and reliable war surplus Stuarts. The Chinese Nationalist Army having suffered great attrition as a result of the ensuing civil war, rebuilt their armored forces by acquiring surplus vehicles left behind in the Philippines by the U.S. forces, including 21 M5A1s to equip two tank companies. They would have their finest hours during the Battle of Kuningtou in 1949, for which the tanks came to be known as the \\"Bear of Kinmen\\" (ÈáëÈñÄ‰πãÁÜä).ÊùéÁ¶è‰∫ïÔºå(Battle of Kuningtou)ÔºåRicefield Publication (1999; ), pp.68-69. The M5 played a significant role in the First Kashmir War (1947) between India and Pakistan, including the battle of Zoji-la pass fought at an elevation of nearly 12,000 ft. M3A3s were used by British forces in Indonesia during the Indonesian National Revolution, where they suffered heavy losses due to the Stuart's thin armour plating. They were used until 1946, when the British left. The M3A3s were then passed on to the KNIL, which used them until the end of the fighting before passing on the tanks to the Indonesian National Army. The tank saw action during the DI/TII rebellions in Aceh and Java, RMS rebellions in South Maluku, PRRI rebellions in Sumatra, Permesta rebellions in Northern Sulawesi and the fighting against the 30 September movement. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Portuguese Army also used some in the war in Angola, where its all terrain capability (compared to wheeled vehicles) was greatly appreciated. In 1967, the Portuguese Army deployed three M5A1 Light Tanks ‚Äì nicknamed \\"Milocas\\", \\"Licas\\", and \\"Gina\\" by their crews ‚Äì in northern Angola, which served with the 1927th Cavalry Battalion commanded by Cavalry Major Jo√£o Mendes Paulo, stationed at Nambuangongo. The vehicles were mostly employed for convoy escort and recovery duties, and limited counterinsurgency operations against National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) guerrillas, who dubbed them \\"Elefante Dundum‚Äù. \\"Milocas\\" was destroyed by an accidental fire in 1969, while \\"Gina\\" and \\"Licas\\" were withdrawn from active service in 1972, the former being sent to Luanda and the latter ended up in 1973 as an airfield security pillbox in the Portuguese Air Force's Zala airfield.Alexandre Gon√ßalves, Odissea em √Åfrica ‚Äì Os M5A1 em Angola, in Cadernos Militares do Lanceiro n.¬∫3, Lisbon 2010, pp. 83‚Äì91 Period photographs show some modifications to the basic design, namely the omission of the bow machine gun, re-installed on a pintle mount in the roof of the turret, and a small searchlight fitted in front of the commander‚Äôs cupola.Manuel A.

During the four-day long Football War of 1969, El Salvador invaded Honduras in an all-out-war strike using the M3 Stuart as the main battle tank. El Salvador captured eight major cities before the Organization of American States arranged a ceasefire. The South African Armoured Corps continued to use M3A1s in a reserve role until 1955. Some were refurbished locally in 1962 and remained in service as late as 1964. The fleet was withdrawn in 1968, owing to parts shortage.

The Locust began development in 1941 after the British War Office requested that the American government design a purpose-built airborne light tank which could be transported by glider into battle to support British airborne forces. The War Office had originally selected the Light Tank Mark VII Tetrarch light tank for use by the airborne forces, but it had not been designed with that exact purpose in mind so the War Office believed that a purpose-built tank would be required to replace it. The United States Ordnance Department was asked to produce this replacement, which in turn selected Marmon-Herrington to design and build a prototype airborne tank in May 1941. The prototype was designated the Light Tank T9 (Airborne), and was designed so that it could be transported underneath a Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft, although its dimensions also allowed it to fit inside a General Aircraft Hamilcar glider. After a series of modifications were made to the initial prototype, production of the T9 began in April 1943. It was significantly delayed, however, when several faults were found with the tank's design. Marmon-Herrington only began to produce significant numbers of the T9 in late 1943 and early 1944, and by then the design was considered to be obsolete; only 830 were built by the time production ended in February 1945. As a result, the Ordnance Department gave the tank the specification number M22 but no combat units were equipped with it. However, the War Office believed that the tank would perform adequately despite its faults, so the tank was given the title of \\"Locust\\" and 260 were shipped to Great Britain under the Lend-Lease Act. Seventeen Locusts were received by the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment in late 1943, but mechanical problems led to the tanks being withdrawn in favour of the Tetrarchs previously used by the regiment. In October 1944 however, the remaining Tetrarchs of the regiment were replaced by Locusts and eight were used during Operation Varsity in March 1945. The tanks did not perform well in action; several were damaged during the landing process and one was knocked out by a German self-propelled gun. Only two Locusts were able to reach their planned rendezvous point and go into action, occupying a piece of high ground along with an infantry company. The tanks were forced to withdraw from the position after several hours however, because they attracted artillery fire that caused the infantry to suffer heavy casualties. The Locust never saw active service with the British Army again and was classified as obsolete in 1946. A number of Locusts were used by foreign militaries in the post-war period however; the Belgian Army used Locusts as command tanks for their M4 Sherman tank regiments, and the Egyptian Army used several company-sized units of Locusts during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War.  Development history  = Background = The Light Tank (Airborne) M22, also known as the Locust, began development in late 1941 in response to a request by the British military earlier in the year for an airmobile light tank which could be transported onto a battlefield by glider.Flint, p. 22. At the time the request was made, the War Office considered using the equipment in Britain's fledgling airborne forces, which had been formed in June 1940 by order of the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.Otway, p. 21. When officials at the War Office examined the equipment that would be required for a British airborne division, they decided that gliders would be an integral component of such a force. These gliders would be used to transport troops and heavy equipment, which by 1941 was to include artillery and some form of tank.Flint, p. 15. Plans to transport an airborne tank went through a number of revisions, but by May 1941 it was considered feasible for a tank weighing to be carried for in a glider, although the latter would have to be specifically designed for the task. In a conference held on January 16, 1941, it was decided that the General Aircraft Hamilcar, under development at the time, would be used to transport a single tank or two Universal Carriers.Flint, pp. 15‚Äì16. A decision had recently been made by the War Office that light tanks were no longer to be generally used in the British Army; on the whole they had performed poorly during the Battle of France and were considered to be a liability. As a result, the Vickers- Armstrong Light Tank Mk VII Tetrarch light tank was now considered obsolete. This made it available for use by the airborne forces and it was chosen by the War Office as the tank to be transported by glider.Flint, p. 16. However, it had not been designed specifically as an airborne tank or to be airmobile, and it also possessed several faults.Flint, p. 11. Its size limited the possible crew to three‚Äîa driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret‚Äîwhich was found to be too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, in addition to his own duties, had to act as loader for the 2-pounder, which caused delays in combat; a report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that since the commander had both to fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible. The War Office was also aware that the tank had a faulty cooling system that made the Tetrarch unsuitable for service in hotter climates, such as the Middle East and North Africa.Flint, p. 13. A purpose- built airborne light tank was therefore required to replace the Tetrarch, but the decision was taken by the War Office not to produce the tank in Britain due to a lack of production capacity. Instead the American government was approached with a request that it produce a replacement for the Tetrarch.Flint, p. 23. This request was made by the British Air Commission in Washington, D.C., with a proposal calling for a tank of between and to be developed, this being the maximum weight the War Office had decided could be carried by current glider technology. The proposed tank was to have a primary armament of a main gun and secondary armament of a .30-06 Browning M1919A4, and a crew of three. The specification also called for a maximum speed of and an operational radius of . The turret and front of the hull were to have an armour thickness of between and , and the sides of the tank a thickness of . The United States Ordnance Department was given the task of developing the proposed tank, and in turn requested designs from three American companies: General Motors, J. Walter Christie and Marmon-Herrington. The design offered by Christie in mid-1941 was rejected as it failed to meet the specified size requirements, as was a modified design the company produced in November.Zaloga, M551 Sheridan, p. 5. At a conference in May 1941, the Ordnance Department chose the Marmon-Herrington design and requested that the company produce a prototype tank, which was completed in late 1941; it was designated the Light Tank T9 (Airborne) by the company and the Ordnance Department.Flint, p. 24. = Development = The T9 had a crew of three and weighed . It was armed with a main gun and a coaxial .30-06 Browning M1919A4 machine-gun, as well as two further machine-guns on the right-hand side of the bow. The main gun and coaxial machine-gun were mounted in a powered turret, which also had a gun stabilizer installed to allow the gun to be fired when the tank was moving. The T9 was powered by a 162 horse-power six-cylinder, air-cooled Lycoming engine, and the thickness of the armor varied; the front, rear and sides of the hull had a thickness of while the sloped portions of the hull had a thickness of . The tank's engine was able to give it a maximum speed of . The T9 was not primarily designed to be transported by glider, a significant change from the original request, but instead was to be carried under the belly of a Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft, using four lifting brackets welded onto each side of the hull of the tank. The turret was designed to be removable so that it could be detached and transported inside the C-54 and reattached once on the battlefield. The loading took six men about twenty-five minutes, the unloading ten minutes. On top of this the aircraft required a proper airfield on which to land.Fletcher, p. 72 However, the T9 was of the correct shape, weight and size to be carried inside a Hamilcar glider, suggesting that these dimensions had been chosen deliberately so that the tank could be transported inside a glider if required.Flint, pp. 24‚Äì25. alt=A large, bulky glider with long wings in flight, coming in to land on a runway. It is casting a shadow to its right on the runway. Fields can be seen behind it, and there are trees and bushes in the background. A number of changes were made to the prototype during testing. The main change was the addition of supporting steel beams to improve and strengthen the suspension of the tank, which increased the weight to , the maximum weight that could be carried by a Hamilcar glider.Flint, p. 25. Two new prototypes were ordered by the Ordnance Department in January 1942 and were delivered by Marmon- Herrington in November 1942. They were both designated T9E1. The new tanks incorporated a number of requested changes. The turret was altered in shape; it was lightened by the removal of the power traverse mechanism and the gyro stabilizer for the main armament. The front of the hull was altered from a stepped appearance to a more sloped profile, which would provide for a better ballistic shape; the two .30-06 machine-guns were removed from the bow of the tank and the suspension was altered to try and reduce the weight of the design. However, contrary to normal practice, the Ordnance Department had placed an order for the original T9 design in April 1942, before the T9E1 models were delivered in November 1942; 500 were ordered in April and this order rapidly increased to a total of 1900, with deliveries to begin in November. However, production difficulties and design changes caused this date to be delayed several times, and it was not until April 1943 that production on the T9 actually began. Production of the T9 peaked at 100 tanks produced per month between August 1943 and January 1944; however, this number rapidly declined when the results of the British and American testing programmes were reported to the Ordnance Department, and only 830 T9s were ever produced.Flint, p. 26. The faults discovered with the design led to the Ordnance Department giving it the specification number M22, but classing it as 'limited standard'. No American combat units were equipped with the tank, although some of those produced were used for training purposes and two experimental units were formed and equipped with Locusts. The 151st Airborne Tank Company was formed on 15 August 1943, despite concerns that there would be insufficient transport aircraft to deliver the unit into battle, and the 28th Airborne Tank Battalion was also formed in December of the same year. However, neither unit saw combat, due to the US Army's lack of interest in using them in an airborne capacity. The 151st Airborne Tank Company remained in the United States, shuttling from base to base throughout the war, and the 28th Airborne Tank Battalion was refitted with conventional tanks in October 1944.Zaloga, M551 Sheridan, pp. 7‚Äì8. Some 25 Locusts were ordered in April 1944 for use in the European Theater of Operations, and delivered by September; although a small number were sent to the United States Sixth Army Group in Alsace, France, for testing, they were never used in combat.Zaloga, M551 Sheridan, pp. 8‚Äì10. However, the British still required the M22 as a replacement for the Tetrarch and the first prototype Locust was shipped to Britain in May 1942 for testing, followed by the second prototype T9E1 in July 1943.Flint, p. 27. Although they were of the opinion that the M22 possessed a number of faults, the War Office believed it would perform adequately as an airborne tank. Thus the tank received the official title of \\"Locust\\" and 260 were shipped to Britain under the Lend-Lease Act. The majority of the Locusts ended up placed in tank parks until they were scrapped at the end of the conflict, and only eight ever saw action with British airborne forces.Flint, pp. 27‚Äì28. = Faults = Extensive testing of the M22 occurred in 1943 and 1944, and was conducted by both the Ordnance Department and the British Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) Gunnery School at Lulworth Ranges. These tests uncovered a number of faults and problems with the Locust. The AFV School noted that the process of loading the M22 into a C-54 transport aircraft took considerable time and involved the use of complex equipment. Overall the process took six untrained men 24 minutes, although it was believed this could be shortened with sufficient training. Unloading was also a long process, taking approximately ten minutes; it was noted that the time it took to unload the M22 from a C-54 on the battlefield meant that both the tank and aircraft would make excellent targets for enemy fire.Fletcher, p. 72. Operational use of the tank would therefore be restricted to the availability of airfields large enough to accommodate a fully laden C-54, which might not be in the right geographical location or might even have to be captured in advance of a planned airborne operation. A heavy transport aircraft, the Fairchild C-82 Packet, was developed to specifically carry the M22 inside its fuselage and unload it through a set of clam-shell doors, but it did not enter service until after the war had ended.Zaloga, M551 Sheridan, p. 8. The US Army Armored Board released a critical report on the Locust in September 1943, stating that it was inadequate in the areas of reliability and durability, and indicating that it would not be able to be successfully used during airborne operations.Zaloga, M551 Sheridan, p. 6. By 1944 it was also realized that the design of the tank was actually obsolete. The armor of the M22 in several areas was found to be so thin that it was incapable of even resisting the armor-piercing ammunition of a .50 caliber machine-gun. Complaints were also made about the 37mm main armament, which was not powerful enough to penetrate the armor of most tanks used by the Axis powers. Similarly a report made on March 13, 1944 by elements of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment complained that when a high-explosive shell was fired from the gun, the resulting shell-burst was so weak that observers had difficulty in seeing where it impacted.Flint, p. 162. There were also mechanical problems with the design, which caused it to be unreliable; the engine was also found to be underpowered, possibly due to problems with the torque characteristics of the engine or an inefficient transmission system.  Operational history  = World War II =  Initial service  By late 1941, several new British units had been raised specifically trained to conduct airborne operations. The largest such unit was the newly formed 1st Airborne Division, and on 19 January 1942 the War Office took the decision that a light tank detachment would be amongst the support units attached to the division. Designated the Light Tank Squadron, this unit was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division, using their speed to capture objectives and hold them until relieved by other units.Flint, pp. 75‚Äì76. The unit chosen for conversion into the Light Tank Squadron was 'C' Special Services Squadron, which had seen service as an independent tank unit during Operation Ironclad, the invasion of Madagascar in mid-1942. The squadron was also equipped with Tetrarchs, which had recently been re-designated as an airborne tank by the War Office. 'C' Squadron was officially transferred to the 1st Airborne Division on 24 June 1942, bringing with it seven Tetrarchs amongst the other vehicles it was equipped with.Flint, p. 77. The unit immediately began training, but did not stay attached to the 1st Airborne Division for very long; during mid-1943, the division was transported to the Middle East, where it would eventually participate in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of the island of Sicily. 'C' Squadron remained in Britain however, as not enough Hamilcar gliders had yet been built to transport and deploy all of their Tetrarchs.Flint, p. 80. Littlejohn (Janeƒçek) adaptor.Fitzsimons, p.1753 The Tetrarch was originally used by British airborne forces, but was eventually replaced by the Locust.alt=A small, squat tank sits in a field, its left-hand tracks facing the camera. Its gun barrel has been lengthened with a metal extension. A man in uniform with a black beret stands next to it. In the background, fields can be seen to the left, and several houses to the right. The squadron was transferred to the division with which it would spend the rest of the war; the 6th Airborne Division, raised in April 1943. The squadron continued to train as an air- portable unit and participated in a number of exercises intended to familiarize it with the duties it would perform, including reconnaissance of enemy positions and performing counter-attacks against enemy infantry and armor.Flint, pp. 83‚Äì84. In mid-July an American pilot was sent to Britain to illustrate that the tank could fit inside a Hamilcar and be landed,Zaloga, M551 Sheridan, p. 10. and then on October 25 the Light Tank Squadron received a shipment of seventeen Locusts. During November the new tanks were issued to the squadron, replacing a majority of the Tetrarchs; however a small number of Tetrarchs fitted with a 3 inch (76.2 mm) infantry support howitzer, which were designated as Tetrarch 1 CS (Close Support), were retained.Flint, p. 83. Several of the Locusts also were fitted with Littlejohn adaptors to increase the range and penetration power of their main armament, although it is not clear how many were fitted or if they were fitted at manufacture or after they reached the squadron. The squadron was expanded into the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment in December 1943, and as late as March 1944, plans were made for the regiment to be equipped with seventeen Locusts and three Tetrarchs when it took part in Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy. However, records indicate that by April the Hamilcar gliders of the regiment were being refitted to only carry Tetrarchs, and by late March the Locusts appear to have been completely replaced. This seems to have been due to mechanical and gunnery problems with the Locusts, as well as specific problems with the design of the Locust's gearbox. The regiment took part in Operation Tonga as part of 6th Airlanding Brigade in June 1944, equipped with twenty Tetrarchs.Flint, p. 106. However, due to their thin armor and underpowered armament they proved to be completely outclassed by the tanks and self-propelled guns deployed by German forces, such as the Panzer IV and the Sturmgesch√ºtz III.Flint, pp. 122‚Äì123. By August, in preparation for the 6th Airborne Division's participation in the planned breakout from the Normandy bridgehead, the majority of Tetrarchs in 'A' Squadron were replaced with Cromwell fast cruiser tanks; only three Tetrarchs were retained, remaining with the Headquarters troop of 'A' Squadron.Flint, p. 125. In September the division returned to Britain and in the first week of October 1944, the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment underwent an extensive reorganization. The regiment was completely restructured and retired all the remaining Tetrarch tanks it was equipped with, replacing them with Locusts.Flint, p. 138.  Operation Varsity  In March 1945, the 6th Airborne Division was informed that it would be participating in Operation Varsity, an airborne operation in support of 21st Army Group crossing the River Rhine during Operation Plunder. On March 24 the division, in conjunction with the American United States 17th Airborne Division, would be dropped by parachute and glider near the city of Wesel, where it would capture the strategically important village of Hamminkeln, several important bridges over the River IJssel and the southern portion of a major forest, the Diersfordter Wald.Otway, pp. 302‚Äì303. Eight Locusts from the regiment, divided into two troops of four, would land with the 6th Airlanding Brigade in landing-zone 'P' east of the Diersfordter Wald and west of Hamminkeln, acting as a divisional reserve; the rest of the regiment would arrive by road after crossing the Rhine with 21st Army Group.Flint, p. 152. alt=A Locust tank, facing right, on a road that cuts through a field. Several uniformed men move in the opposite direction in the foreground. A large military glider can be seen in the background, just behind the Locust. The eight Locusts were loaded into separate Hamilcar gliders between 17‚Äì20 March, and on the morning of 24 March were towed from the airfield by Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers to join the rest of the gliders and transport aircraft carrying the two airborne divisions. Weather conditions for the operation were excellent, with clear visibility, and all eight gliders arrived in the vicinity of the landing zone without incident.Flint, p. 153 During their attempts to land, however, the small force was severely depleted; one glider broke away from the Halifax towing it and disintegrated, apparently as a result of structural failure, with the Locust inside it falling to the ground.Flint, p. 154. Three more gliders came under heavy German anti-aircraft fire and crashed as they landed; one tank survived with a damaged machine gun, another crashed through a house which put its wireless radio set and main armament out of action, and the third broke loose of the glider as it landed and was flipped over onto its turret, rendering it useless.Flint, pp. 155‚Äì156. Six Locusts landed intact on the landing zone, including several with significant damage, but two of these tanks did not reach the rendezvous point chosen for the regiment. One undamaged tank came to the aid of a group of American paratroopers who were under fire from a German self-propelled gun but was rapidly knocked out by the German vehicle, wounding two crewmembers. A second tank broke down as it attempted to tow a jeep out of a crashed glider, although the crew remained with the tank and supported British airborne troops in the area.Flint, p. 156. Of the four Locusts that reached the rendezvous point, only two were undamaged and fully fit for action; these two were immediately deployed to the high ground east of the Diersfordter Wald, while being covered by the two damaged tanks. Upon arrival they were engaged by German troops and had to be supported by an infantry company, and soon their presence began attracting a great deal of artillery and anti-tank fire.Flint, p. 157 Although neither of the tanks were hit, a number of infantrymen were killed or wounded and after several hours the tanks were forced to withdraw. The four tanks and remaining infantry formed a small force that repelled several German attacks on their position, and were eventually relieved at 10:30 by a tank squadron from the 44th Royal Tank Regiment and elements of the rest of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment.Flint, p. 158. = Post-war = Damaged M22 Locust in alt=A beige-coloured Locust tank faces the camera, with its gun barrel pointing upwards slightly. Its right-hand track has been damaged and is falling off. The front section of the hull is missing two large loop-shaped handles that other examples possess. It is situated on grassland, with a road passing next to it. Operation Varsity was the only time the Locust was used in action with the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment or the British Army as a whole. A report issued at the end of a conference held by the Director (Air) of the War Office in January 1946 confirmed that the Locust design was considered obsolete; any light tanks to be used in post-war airborne formations would be made from completely new designs.Flint, p. 192. The British Army disposed of a small number of Locusts by transferring them to foreign militaries. Several had their main armaments removed and were used by the Belgian Army as command tanks for their M4 Sherman regiments, and a few Locusts even found their way back to the U.S., where they had their turrets removed and served as agricultural tractors.Flint, p. 193. A larger number of Locusts served with the Egyptian Army, replacing a number of older tank models, such as the Vickers-Armstrong Mark V light tank, that the Egyptian military had acquired during the interwar period.Zaloga, Armour of the Middle East Wars pp. 4‚Äì5. Several company-sized units of Locusts were used by the Egyptians during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War.

In British service it was given the service name Chaffee after the United States Army General Adna R. Chaffee Jr., who helped develop the use of tanks in the United States armed forces. M24s were mostly removed from U.S. and NATO armies by the 1960s, but remained in service with some Third World countries. Development and production history British combat experience in the North African campaign identified several shortcomings of the M3 Stuart light tank, especially the performance of its 37 mm cannon. A 75 mm gun was experimentally fitted to a Howitzer Motor Carriage M8 - an M3 tank with a larger turret - and trials indicated that a 75 mm gun on the M5 light tank development of the M3 was possible. The M3/M5 design was dated though, and the 75 mm gun reduced storage space. The T7 light tank design, which was initially seen as a replacement, grew in weight to more than 25 short tons taking it out of the light tank classification, and so was designated as the Medium Tank M7. The weight increase without increased power gave it unsatisfactory performance; the program was stopped in March 1943 to allow standardization on a single medium tank - the M4 medium. This prompted the Ordnance Committee to issue a specification for a new light tank, with the same powertrain as the M5A1 but armed with a 75 mm gun. In April 1943, the Ordnance Corps, together with Cadillac (who manufactured the M5), started work on the new project, designated Light Tank T24. The powerplant and transmission of the M5 were used together with some aspects of the T7. Efforts were made to keep the weight of the vehicle under 20 tons. The armor was extremely light and was sloped to maximize effectiveness. The turret was 25 mm thick with a 38 mm thick gun mantlet. The glacis plate was 25 mm thick. Side hull armor thickness varied: the frontal section was 25 mm thick but the rear third of the armor (which covered the engine compartment) was only 19 mm. A new lightweight 75 mm gun was developed, a derivative of the gun used in the B-25H Mitchell bomber. The gun had the same ballistics as the 75 mm M3 in use by American tanks but used a thinly walled barrel and different recoil mechanism. The design featured tracks and torsion bar suspension, similar to the slightly earlier M18 Hellcat tank destroyer, which itself started in production in July 1943. The torsion bar system was to give a smoother ride than the vertical volute suspension used on most US armored vehicles. At the same time, the chassis was expected to be a standard used for other vehicles, such as self- propelled guns, and specialist vehicles; known together as the \\"Light Combat Team\\". It had a relatively low silhouette and a three-man turret. On October 15, 1943, the first pilot vehicle was delivered. The design was judged a success and a contract for 1,000 was immediately raised by the Ordnance Department. This was subsequently increased to 5,000. Production began in 1944 under the designation Light Tank M24. It was produced at two sites; from April at Cadillac and from July at Massey-Harris. By the time production was stopped in August 1945, 4,731 M24s had been produced. Service history US Army M24 Chaffee moving on the outskirts of Salzburg in May 1945 The M24 Chaffee was intended to replace the ageing and obsolete Light Tank M5 (Stuart), which was used in supplementary roles. The first thirty-four M24s reached Europe in November 1944 and were issued to the U.S. 2nd Cavalry Group (Mechanized) in France. These were then issued to Troop F, 2nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc68023/. and Troop F, 42nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, which each received seventeen M24s. During the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, these units and their new tanks were rushed to the southern sector; two of the M24s were detached to serve with the 740th Tank Battalion of the U.S. First Army. The M24 started to enter widespread use in December 1944, but they were slow in reaching the front-line combat units. By the end of the war, the light tank companies of many armored divisions were still mainly equipped with the M3/M5 Stuart. Some armored divisions did not receive their first M24s until the war was over. Aside from the US Army, the British Army was another main user of the Chaffee during the war, with at least several hundred obtained through the US Lend-Lease program. These saw action mainly in northwestern Europe and the North German Plain where British forces saw action against German troops. Reports from the armored divisions that received them prior to the end of hostilities were generally positive. Crews liked the improved off-road performance and reliability, but were most appreciative of the 75 mm main gun, which was a vast improvement over the 37 mm. The M24 was inferior to German tanks, but the bigger gun at least gave its crews a much better chance to fight back when it was required, especially in infantry support. The M24's light armor made it vulnerable to virtually all German tanks, anti-tank guns, and hand-held anti- tank weapons. The contribution of the M24 to winning the war in Europe was insignificant, as too few arrived too late to replace the worn-out M5s of the armored divisions. At the end of WWII, the US Army displayed its Chaffees alongside British Comet tanks and then-latest Soviet tanks, the Iosif Stalin 3 (IS-3) heavy tank, in the Berlin Victory Parade in 1945. When the US began its occupation of Japan that same year, it deployed a large number of light Chaffees instead of bigger Shermans and heavier Pershings due to the narrower roads and smaller weightloads of bridges in the country. 25th Infantry Division wait for an assault of North Korean T-34-85 tanks at Masan During the opening stages of the Korean War, M24s were the initial U.S. tanks directed to combat heavier and larger North Korean T-34-85s supplied by the Soviets. The occupation troops in Japan from which the Chaffee tanks were drawn were inexperienced and under-equipped due to rapid demobilization after World War II. One other reason for sending Chaffees to Korea initially was also partly because US officers did not regard Korea as a country where large- scale tank warfare could occur (much of the Korean peninsula is largely mountainous and hilly) and therefore sent lighter armored vehicles to combat the invading North Korean forces. The M24 fared poorly against the invading army's better-armed, better-armored and better-crewed medium tanks, losing most of their number while inflicting only minor damage on the T-34 tank units. Managing a fighting withdrawal, they ended up as infantry-support artillery in the Pusan Perimeter, and in August reinforcements from the US and the Commonwealth brought heavier tanks that were a match for the T-34s, not to mention superior infantry anti-tank armaments and overwhelming air support against North Korean armor. M24s were more successful later in the war in their reconnaissance role and supported by heavier and more capable tanks such as the M4 Sherman, M26 Pershing and M46 Patton, along with British Churchill, Comet and Centurion tanks. Indochina, during the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Like other successful World War II designs, the M24 was supplied to many armies around the globe and was used in local conflicts long after it had been replaced in the U.S. Army by the M41 Walker Bulldog. France employed its M24s in Indo-China in infantry support missions, with good results. They employed ten M24s in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. In December 1953, ten disassembled Chaffees were transported by air to provide fire support to the garrison. They fired about 15,000 shells in the long siege that followed before the Viet Minh forces finally overcame the camp in May 1954, almost all being entirely worn out and badly damaged by the time the battle was over. France also deployed the M24 in Algeria, with some variants which fought there carrying an AMX-13 turret modified by France. Some former French and US Chaffees are known to have been passed down to the Army of South Vietnam, where they saw service at least until the Battle of Hu·∫ø, with several serving as fixed gun emplacements outside vital military installations such as airbases. The last time the M24 is known to have been in action was in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, where 66 Pakistani Chaffees stationed in East Pakistan (today's Bangladesh) were lost to Indian Army T-55s, PT-76s, and anti-tank teams, being easy prey for the better-equipped invading Indian forces. Although both Iran and Iraq had M24s prior to the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, there is no report of their use in that conflict. South Korean Chaffees saw limited service during the Korean War, often performing hit-and-run raids on communist forces. Cambodia, Laos, Japan and Taiwan were four other Asian nations to have operated Chaffees aside from South Vietnam, South Korea and Pakistan. The Greek Army received 85 M24s from the U.S. from 1950 until 1970. The M24s initially were organized in two Tank Regiments numbered 392, 393. In later years the Tank Regiments were reorganized in Tank Battalions with the same numbers. From 1962 till the early seventies the M24s in Tank Battalions were replaced with M47s and the M24s were used to equip Independent Reconnaissance Companies with an additional 121 M24s received from Italy in 1975. From 1991 till 1995 61 M24s were scrapped due to CFE Treaty limitations.Hellenic Army General Staff / Training Directorate (ŒìŒµŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒïœÄŒπœÑŒµŒªŒµŒØŒø Œ£œÑœÅŒ±œÑŒøœç / ŒîŒπŒµœçŒ∏œÖŒΩœÉŒ∑ ŒïŒ∫œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµœçœÉŒµœâœÇ), History of Cavalry and Tank Corps (ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ± ŒôœÄœÄŒπŒ∫Œøœç Œ§ŒµŒ∏œâœÅŒ±Œ∫ŒπœÉŒºŒ≠ŒΩœâŒΩ), Athens (ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±), 1995 The rest are abandoned in or outside military camps and one M24 is preserved in the Greek Army Tank Museum.

Foreign variants =NM-116= In 1972, the Norwegian Army decided to retain 54 of their 123 M24 light tanks as reconnaissance vehicles after they were substantially rebuilt under the designation NM-116. It was calculated that the NM-116 rebuilding program cost only about a third as much as contemporary light tanks. This program was managed by the firm Thune-Eureka. The American firm NAPCO developed an improved power pack based around the 6V53T diesel engine used in the M113 armored personnel carrier mated to an Allison MT-653 transmission. The original 75 mm Gun M6 L/39 was replaced with a French D-925 90 mm low pressure gun, with a co-axial 0.50-inch (12.7 mm) M2 heavy machine gun. The bow gunner position was eliminated in favor of ammunition stowage. A new fire-control system was installed, complete with a Simrad LV3 laser rangefinder. Norwegian firms also converted eight M24 light tanks into light armored recovery vehicles to support the NM-116. The NM-116 were retired from service in 1993. =Other variants= The Chilean Army up- gunned their M24s in the mid-1980s to the IMI-OTO 60 mm Hyper Velocity Medium Support (HVMS) gun, with roughly comparable performance to a standard 90 mm gun.

In Britain, the tank was called by two names based on the turret configuration and crew size. Tanks employing US pattern turrets were called the \\"Lee\\", named after Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Variants using British pattern turrets were known as \\"Grant\\", named after Union general Ulysses S. Grant. Design commenced in July 1940, and the first M3s were operational in late 1941.Zaloga p. 16 & 20 The U.S. Army needed a medium tank armed with a 75mm gun and, coupled with the United Kingdom's immediate demand for 3,650 medium tanks,Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 20 & 21 the Lee began production by late 1940. The design was a compromise meant to produce a tank as soon as possible. The M3 had considerable firepower and good armor, but had serious drawbacks in its general design and shape, including a high silhouette, an archaic sponson mounting of the main gun preventing the tank from taking a hull-down position, riveted construction, and poor off-road performance. Its overall performance was not satisfactory and the tank was withdrawn from combat in most theaters as soon as the M4 Sherman tank became available in larger numbers. In spite of this, it was considered by Hans von Luck (an Oberst (Colonel) in the Wehrmacht Heer and the author of Panzer Commander) to be superior to the best German tank at the time of its introduction, the Panzer IV (at least until the F2 variant). Despite being replaced elsewhere, the British continued to use M3s in combat against the Japanese in southeast Asia until 1945. Nearly a thousand M3s were supplied to the Soviet military under Lend-Lease between 1941‚Äì1943. Development In , the U.S. Army possessed approximately 400 tanks, mostly M2 Light Tanks, with 18 of the to-be-discontinued M2 Medium Tanks as the only ones considered \\"modern\\".Hunnicutt p. 44 The U.S. funded tank development poorly during the interwar years, and had little experience in design as well as poor doctrine to guide design efforts. M3 Lee being manufactured. The M2 Medium Tank was typical of armored fighting vehicles (AFVs) many nations produced in 1939. When the U.S. entered the war, the M2 design was already obsolete with a 37 mm gun, an impractical number of secondary machine guns, a very high silhouette, and 32 mm frontal armor. The Panzer III and Panzer IV's success in the French campaign led the U.S. Army to immediately order a new medium tank armed with a 75 mm gun in a turret as a response. This would be the M4 Sherman. Until the Sherman reached production, an interim design with a 75 mm gun was urgently needed. The M3 was the solution. The design was unusual because the main weapon ‚Äì a larger caliber, medium-velocity 75 mm gun ‚Äì was in an offset sponson mounted in the hull with limited traverse. The sponson mount was necessary because, at the time, American tank plants did not have the design experience necessary to make a gun turret capable of holding a 75 mm weapon. A small turret with a lighter, high-velocity 37 mm gun sat on top of the tall hull. A small cupola on top of the turret held a machine gun. The use of two main guns was seen on the French Char B1 and the Mark I version of the British Churchill tank. In each case, two weapons were mounted to give the tanks adequate capability in firing both anti-personnel high explosive and canister ammunition and armor-piercing ammunition for anti-tank combat. The M3 differed slightly from this pattern, having a main gun that could fire an armor- piercing projectile at a velocity high enough for effectively piercing armor, as well as deliver a high-explosive shell that was large enough to be effective. Using a hull mounted gun, the M3 design could be produced faster than a tank featuring a turreted gun. It was understood that the M3 design was flawed, but BritainZaloga, Armored Thunderbolt, p. 21 urgently needed tanks. A drawback of the sponson mount was that the M3 could not take a hull-down position and use its 75 mm gun at the same time. The M3 was tall and roomy: the power transmission ran through the crew compartment under the turret basket to the gearbox driving the front sprockets. Steering was by differential braking, with a turning circle of . The vertical volute-sprung suspension (VVSS) units possessed a return roller mounted directly atop the main housing of each of the six suspension units (three per side), designed as self-contained and readily replaced modular units bolted to the hull sides. The turret was power-traversed by an electro-hydraulic system in the form of an electric motor providing the pressure for the hydraulic motor. This fully rotated the turret in 15 seconds. Control was from a spade grip on the gun. The same motor provided pressure for the gun stabilizing system. Front view of an M3. The 75 mm gun was operated by a gunner and a loader; sighting the gun used an M1 periscope ‚Äì with an integral telescope ‚Äì on the top of the sponson. The periscope rotated with the gun. The sight was marked from zero to , with vertical markings to aid deflection shooting at a moving target. The gunner laid the gun on target through geared handwheels for traverse and elevation. The shorter barreled 75 mm M2 cannon sometimes featured a counterweight at the end of the barrel to balance the gun for operation with the gyrostabilizer until the longer 75 mm M3 variant was brought into use.\\"Medium Tank M3 Lee\\" The 37 mm gun was aimed through the M2 periscope, mounted in the mantlet to the side of the gun. It also sighted the coaxial machine gun. Two range scales were provided: 0‚Äì for the 37 mm and 0‚Äì for the machine gun. The 37 mm gun also featured a counterweight ‚Äì a long rod under the barrel ‚Äì though it was ill maintained by crews who knew little about its use. British M3 Grant (left) and Lee (right) at El Alamein (Egypt), in the Sahara Desert, 1942, showing differences between the British turret and the original design. There were also two .30-06 Browning M1919A4 machine guns mounted in the hull, fixed in traverse but adjustable in elevation, which were controlled by the driver. These were, due to coordination issues, removed, though they would be seen on early Sherman tanks.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p7eJr0grTc Inside the Chieftain's Hatch: M3 Grant. Part 1 Though not at war, the U.S. was willing to produce, sell and ship armored vehicles to Britain. The British had requested that their Matilda II infantry tank and Crusader cruiser tank designs be made by American factories, but this request was refused. With much of their equipment left on the beaches near Dunkirk, the equipment needs of the British were acute. Though not entirely satisfied with the design, they ordered the M3 in large numbers. British experts had viewed the mock-up in 1940 and identified features that they considered flaws ‚Äì the high profile, the hull mounted main gun, the lack of a radio in the turret (though the tank did have a radio down in the hull), the riveted armor plating (whose rivets tended to pop off inside the interior in a deadly ricochet when the tank was hit by a non-penetrating round), the smooth track design, insufficient armor plating and lack of splash-proofing of the joints. The British desired modifications for the tank they were purchasing. A bustle rack was to be made at the back of the turret to house the Wireless Set No. 19. The turret was to be given thicker armor plate than in the original U.S. design, and the machine gun cupola was to be replaced with a simple hatch. Extended space within the turret of the new M3 also allowed the use of a smoke bomb launcher, although the addition of the radio would take the space for storage of fifty 37 mm rounds, reducing the ammunition capacity to 128 rounds. Several of these new \\"Grant\\" tanks would also be equipped with sand shields for action in North Africa, though they often fell off.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu8NwLls7PY&t;=1048s Inside the Chieftain's Hatch: M3 Grant. Part 2 With these modifications accepted, the British ordered 1,250 M3s. The order was subsequently increased with the expectation that when the M4 Sherman was available, it could replace part of the order. Contracts were arranged with three U.S. companies. The total cost of the order was approximately US$240 million, the sum of all British funds in the US; it took the US Lend-Lease act to solve the financial shortfall. The prototype was completed in March 1941 and production models followed, with the first British-specification tanks produced in July. Both U.S. and British tanks had thicker armor than first planned. The British design required one fewer crew member than the US version due to the radio in the turret. The U.S. eventually eliminated the full-time radio operator, assigning the task to the driver. After extensive losses in Africa and Greece, the British realized that to meet their needs for tanks, both the Lee and the Grant types would need to be accepted. The U.S. military used the \\"M\\" (Model) letter to designate nearly all of their equipment. When the British Army received their new M3 medium tanks from the US, confusion immediately set inZaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 18 between the different M3 medium tank and M3 light tank. The British Army began naming their American tanks after American military figures, although the U.S. Army never used those terms until after the war.Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 19 M3 tanks with the cast turret and radio setup received the name \\"General Grant\\", while the original M3s were called \\"General Lee\\", or more usually just \\"Grant\\" and \\"Lee\\".Bishop (The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II) p. 34 The chassis and running gear of the M3 design was adapted by the Canadians for their Ram tank. The hull of the M3 was also used for self-propelled artillery as with the original design of the M7 Priest, of which nearly 3,500 were built, and recovery vehicles. Operational history Of the 6,258 M3 variants manufactured in the United States, 2,855 (45%) were officially handed over to the British government. The M3 Grant first saw action with the Royal Armoured Corps in North Africa, during May 1942. However, most of the M3s ordered by the UK quickly became surplus to the requirements of the British Army. * 1,700 were transferred to the Australian Army, for home defence and training duties in Australia. * The British Indian Army received 900 Grants * A further 22% (1,386) were exported directly from the US to the Soviet Union,Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 28, 30, 31 although only 969 of these reached Russian ports, due to German U-boat and air attacks on Allied convoys.Lend-Lease tanks and aircrafts [sic] =North African campaign= The M3 brought much-needed firepower to British forces in the North African desert campaign. Crew of M3 tank at Souk el Arba, Tunisia, November 23, 1942. The American M3 medium tank's first action during the war was in , during the North African Campaign.Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 28 British Lees and Grants were in action against Rommel's forces at the Battle of Gazala on 27 May that year. Their appearance was a surprise to the Germans, who were unprepared for the M3's 75 mm gun. They soon discovered the M3 could engage them beyond the effective range of their 5 cm Pak 38 anti-tank gun, and the 5 cm KwK 39 of the Panzer III, their main medium tank. The M3 was also vastly superior to the Fiat M13/40 and M14/41 tanks employed by the Italian troops, whose 47 mm gun was effective only at point-blank range, while only the few Semoventi da 75/18 self-propelled guns were able to destroy it using HEAT rounds. In addition to the M3's 75 mm gun outranging the Panzers, they were equipped with high explosive shells to take out infantry and other soft targets, which previous British tanks lacked; upon the introduction of the M3, Rommel noted: \\"Up to May of 1942, our tanks had in general been superior in quality to the corresponding British types. This was now no longer true, at least not to the same extent.\\" Despite the M3's advantages and surprise appearance during the Battle of Gazala, it could not win the battle for the British. In particular, the high-velocity 88 mm Flak gun, adapted as an anti- tank gun, proved deadly if British tanks attacked without artillery support.The M-3 Grant: America's Nazi Germany Tank-Killer - Nationalinterest.org, 22 January 2017 Britain's Director of Armoured Fighting Vehicles nonetheless said before the M4 Sherman arrived that \\"The Grants and the Lees have proven to be the mainstay of the fighting forces in the Middle East; their great reliability, powerful armament and sound armor have endeared them to the troops.\\" Grants and Lees served with British units in North Africa until the end of the campaign. Following Operation Torch (the invasion of French North Africa), the U.S. also fought in North Africa using the M3 Lee. The US 1st Armored Division had been issued new M4 Shermans, but had to give up one regiment's worth to the British Army prior to the Second Battle of El Alamein. Consequently, a regiment of the division was still using the M3 Lee in North Africa. The M3 was generally appreciated during the North African campaign for its mechanical reliability, good armor protection, and heavy firepower. In all three aspects, the M3 was capable of engaging German tanks and towed anti-tank guns. However, the high silhouette and low, hull-mounted 75 mm were tactical drawbacks since they prevented fighting from a hull-down firing position. In addition, the use of riveted hull superstructure armor on the early versions led to spalling, where the impact of enemy shells caused the rivets to break off and become projectiles inside the tank. Later models were built with all-welded armor to eliminate this problem. These lessons had already been applied to the design and production of the M4. The M3 was replaced in front-line roles by the M4 Sherman as soon as the M4 was available. However, several specialist vehicles based on the M3 were later employed in Europe, such as the M31 armored recovery vehicle and the Canal Defence Light. =Eastern Europe- Soviet Service= A company of M3 Lees of the Soviet 6th Guards Army advanced towards the front line during the Battle of Kursk, July 1943 Beginning from 1941, 1,386 M3 medium tanks were shipped from the USA to the Soviet Union, with 417 lost during shipping (when they went down with their transporting vessels which were lost to German submarine, naval and aerial attacks en route). These were supplied through the American Lend-Lease program between 1942 and 1943. Like British Commonwealth units, Soviet Red Army personnel tended to refer to the M3 as the \\"Grant\\", even though all of the M3s shipped to Russia were technically of the \\"Lee\\" variants. The official Soviet designation for it was the –ú3 —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏–π (–ú3—Å), or \\"M3 Medium\\", to distinguish the Lee/Grant from the US-built M3 Stuart light tank, which was also acquired by the USSR under Lend-Lease and was officially known there as the –ú3 –ª—ë–≥–∫–∏–π (–ú3–ª), or \\"M3 Light\\".–õ—ë–≥–∫–∏–π —Ç–∞–Ω–∫ M3/M5 ¬´–ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª –°—Ç—é–∞—Ä—Ç¬ª (In Russian) Due to the vehicle's petrol-fuelled engine, a high tendency to catch fire, and its vulnerability against most types of German armour the Soviet troops encountered from 1942 onwards, the tank was almost entirely unpopular with the Red Army since its induction into the Eastern Front. With almost 1,500 of their own T-34 tanks being built every month, Soviet use of the M3 medium tank declined soon after mid-1943. Soviet troops still fielded their Lee/Grant tanks on secondary and quieter/less-action fronts, such as in the Arctic region during the Red Army's Petsamo‚ÄìKirkenes Offensive against German forces in Norway in October 1944, where the then- obsolete US tanks faced mainly captured French tanks used by the Germans, such as the SOMUA S35, which to a limited extent was somewhat comparable to the Lee/Grant it fought against. =Pacific War= In the Pacific War, armored warfare played a relatively minor role for the Allies as well as for the Japanese, compared with that of naval,Zaloga (Japanese Tanks) back cover & p. 3 air,Ewing p. VII and infantry units. In the Pacific Ocean Theater and the Southwest Pacific Theater, the U.S. Army deployed none of its dedicated armored divisions and only a third of its 70 other separate tank battalions. A small number of M3 Lees saw action in the central Pacific Ocean Theater in . While the US Marine Corps deployed all six of its tank battalions,Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 24 & 301 none of these were equipped with the M3 Lee. (USMC tank battalions were equipped initially with M3 Stuarts, which were then replaced by M4 Shermans in mid-1944.USMC TOEs ) Some M3 Grants played an offensive role with the British Indian Army, in the Southeast Asian Theater. The Australian Army also used Grants during World War II, mainly for homeland defence and training purposes. = Pacific Ocean Theater = US Army M3 Lees during the Battle of Makin The only combat use of the M3 Lee by the US Army against Japanese forcesZaloga Armored Thunderbolt p. 305 occurred during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign of 1943. Following the better-known landing at Tarawa, the US 27th Infantry Division made an amphibious assault on Makin Island with armoured support from a platoon of M3A5 Lees equipped with deep-wading kits belonging to the US Army's 193rd Tank Battalion. = Burma = A British M3 Grant in Mandalay, Burma (Myanmar), during the Burma Campaign in March 1945. Spare tracks are welded onto the front glacis for extra protection.After British Commonwealth forces in Europe and the Mediterranean began receiving M4 Shermans, about 900 British-ordered M3 Lees/Grants were shipped to the Indian Army. Some of these saw action against Japanese troops and tanks in the Burma Campaign of WWII.Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 30-31 They were used by the British Fourteenth ArmyHunnicutt (Sherman) p. 105 until the fall of Rangoon, regarded as performing \\"admirably\\" in the original intended role of supporting infantry in Burma between 1944 and 1945.Zaloga Armored Thunderbolt p. 31 In the Burma Campaign, the M3 medium tank's main task was infantry support. It played a pivotal role during the Battle of Imphal, during which the Imperial Japanese Army's 14th Tank Regiment (primarily equipped with their own Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks, together with a handful of captured British M3 Stuart light tanks as well) encountered M3 medium tanks for the first time and found their light tanks outgunned and outmatched by the better British armour.Zaloga (Japanese Tanks 1939-45) p. 40 Despite their worse-than-average off-road performance, the British M3 tanks performed well as they traversed the steep hillsides around Imphal and defeated the assaulting Japanese forces. Officially declared obsolete in April 1944, nevertheless, the Lee/Grant saw action until the end of the war in September 1945. = Australia = At the beginning of the war, Australian Army doctrine viewed tank units as minor offensive components within infantry divisions. It had no dedicated armoured branch and most of its very limited capabilities in tank warfare had been deployed to the North African Campaign (i.e. three divisional cavalry battalions). By early 1941, the effectiveness of large-scale German panzer attacks had been recognised, and a dedicated armoured mustering was formed. The Australian Armoured Corps initially included the cadres of three armoured divisions ‚Äì all of which were equipped at least partly with M3 Grants made available from surplus British orders. The 1st Australian Armoured Division was formed with a view towards complementing the three Australian infantry divisions then in North Africa. However, following the outbreak of hostilities with Japan,Zach Lambert, 2012, \\"The Birth, Life and Death of the 1st Australian Armoured Division\\", Australian Army Journal vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 96‚Äì97. the division was retained in Australia. During April‚ÄìMay 1942, the 1st Armoured Division's regiments were reported to be re-equipping with M3 Grants and were training, in a series of large exercises, in the area around Narrabri, New South Wales. The cadres of other two divisions, the 2nd and 3rd Armoured Divisions were both officially formed in 1942, as Militia (reserve/home defence) units. These divisions were also partly equipped with M3 Grants.Ronald Hopkins, 1978, Australian Armour: A History of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps 1927‚Äì1972, Puckapunyal, Royal Australian Armoured Corps Tank Museum, pp. 125‚Äì130, 326. In January 1943, the main body of the 1st Armoured Division was deployed to home defence duties between Perth and Geraldton, Western Australia, where it formed part of III Corps. By the middle of the war, the Australian Army had deemed the Grant to be unsuitable for combat duties overseas and M3 units were re-equipped with the Matilda II before being deployed to the New Guinea and Borneo Campaigns. Due to personnel shortages, all three divisions were officially disbanded during 1943 and downgraded to brigade- and battalion-level units. Post-war use in Australia During the war, the Australian Army had converted some M3 Grants for special purposes, including a small number of bulldozer variants, beach armoured recovery vehicles, and wader prototypes. Following the end of the war, 14 of the Australian Grants were converted to a local self-propelled gun design, the Yeramba, becoming the only SPG ever deployed by the Australian Army. Fitted with a 25-pounder field gun, the Yerambas remained in service with the 22nd Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, until the late 1950s. Many M3s deemed surplus to Australian Army requirements were acquired by civilian buyers during the 1950s and 1960s for conversion to earthmoving equipment and/or tractors. =Conclusion= Overall, the M3 was able to be effective on the battlefield from 1942 until 1943. However, US armored units lacked tactical expertise on a method to overcome its design.Porter (Allied Tanks of World War II 1339-1945 The World's Greatest Weapons) p. 77 Its armor and firepower were equal or superior to most of the threats it faced, especially in the Pacific. Long-range, high-velocity guns were not yet common on German tanks in the African theater. However, the rapid pace of tank development meant that the M3 was very quickly outclassed. By mid-1942, with the introduction of the German Tiger I, the up-gunning of the Panzer IV to a long 75 mm gun, and the first appearance in 1943 of the Panther, along with the availability of large numbers of the M4 Sherman, the M3 was withdrawn from service in the European Theater.

Some philosophers have argued that it is impossible, or at least improbable, for a deity to exhibit such a property alongside omniscience and omnipotence, as a result of the problem of evil. However, some philosophers, such as Alvin Plantinga, argue the plausibility of co-existence. The word is primarily used as a technical term within academic literature on the philosophy of religion, mainly in context of the problem of evil and theodical responses to such, although even in said contexts the phrases \\"perfect goodness\\" and \\"moral perfection\\" are often preferred because of the difficulties in defining what exactly constitutes \\"infinite benevolence\\". Usage The term is patterned on, and often accompanied by, the terms omniscience and omnipotence, typically to refer to conceptions of an \\"all-good, all-knowing, all-powerful\\" deity. Philosophers and theologians more commonly use phrases like \\"perfectly good\\",This phrase is used in many notable encyclopedia and dictionary entries, such as: or simply the term \\"benevolence\\". The word \\"omnibenevolence\\" may be interpreted to mean perfectly just, all-loving, fully merciful, or any number of other qualities, depending on precisely how \\"good\\" is understood. As such, there is little agreement over how an \\"omnibenevolent\\" being would behave. The earliest record for its use in English, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is in 1679. The Catholic Church does not appear to use the term \\"omnibenevolent\\" in the liturgy or Catechism. Saint Thomas Aquinas in particular explained in Summa Theologica that God may indirectly want evil in the physical world, when this is necessary for the greater good of the order of the universe. Modern users of the term include George H. Smith in his book Atheism: The Case Against God (1980), where he argued that divine qualities are inconsistent. However, the term is also used by authors who defend the coherence of divine attributes, including but not limited to, Jonathan Kvanvig in The Problem of Hell (1993), and Joshua Hoffman and Gary Rosenkrantz in The Divine Attributes (2002). Used throughout the book. The terminology has been used by some prominent Roman Catholic figures, examples being Bishop Robert Barron, Doctor of Sacred Theology in his 2011 book Catholicism: A Journey to the Heart of the Faith. Philosophical perspectives The notion of an omnibenevolent, infinitely compassionate deity, has raised certain atheistic objections, such as the problem of evil and the problem of Hell. Responses to such problems are called theodicies and can be general, arguing for the coherence of the divine, such as Swinburne's Providence and the Problem of Evil, or they can address a specific problem, such as Charles Seymour's A Theodicy of Hell. Proponents of pandeism contend that benevolence (much less omnibenevolence) is simply not required to account for any property of our Universe, as a morally neutral deity which was powerful enough to have created our Universe as we experience it would be, by definition, able to have created our Universe as we experience it. William C. Lane contended that pandeism thereby offered an escape from the evidential argument from evil: In 2010, author William C. Lane contended that: Religious perspectives The theological justification stems from God's aseity: the non-contingent, independent and self-sustained mode of existence that theologians ascribe to God. For if he was not morally perfect, that is, if God was merely a great being but nevertheless of finite benevolence, then his existence would involve an element of contingency, because one could always conceive of a being of greater benevolence. Hence, omnibenevolence is a requisite of perfect being theology. Theologians in Wesleyanism (see Thomas Jay Oord) argue that omnibenevolence is God's primary attribute. Some Hyper- Calvinist interpretations reject omnibenevolence. For example, the Westboro Baptist Church is infamous for its expression of this stance. Christian apologist William Lane Craig argues that Islam does not hold to the idea of omnibenevolence.

Its origins are almost certainly from southern Germany, likely a product of the Benedictine monastery in Tegernsee, Bavaria--as the manuscript that contains the play was kept at the monastery. Most likely the play was written c. 1160 as much of the thematic material corresponds closely to events occurring during the reign of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa I and his troubles with Pope Alexander III. A roughly seventy-line fragment of the play is also extant in a thirteenth- century Gospel text from the St. Georgenberg Abbey in modern-day Fiecht, Austria--suggesting a link between the two monastic communities.https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theatre- survey/article/medieval-space-early-medieval-documents-as- stages/D3FFBEDC8B6DE5F37E1ADB6DF4527D75 Overall, the play is a critique of reform efforts instituted by the Papacy in the twelfth century that would potentially weaken monastic self-rule in favor of a more centralized Papal control over Christian instruction and education, specifically centered on the growth of cathedral schools. The monastery at Tegernsee had enjoyed suzerainty from Papal oversight since the tenth century--answering directly to the Holy Roman Emperor--and sought employ a propaganda effort amongst the many Benedictine communities in Bavaria and Austria in the form of a dramatic interpretation of eschatological events that were supportive of the Emperor as God's instrument in bringing about the final events Christian narrative, rather than those efforts of the Papacy.https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/30891/Thomas_Kyle.pdf?sequence=1 The long-standing designation of the play as a \\"liturgical\\" (dating back to the nineteenth century) is a result of the inclusion of several well-known liturgies popular amongst Benedictine monastic communities. But these liturgies reflect an \\"insider's knowledge\\" of their traditional means of performance, altering the reception of changes made by the author of the play so that the propagandistic messages are codified specifically for the monastic communities that surround Tegernsee. The drama warned its audience of the dangers posed by the Antichrist, a prophesied figure of evil whose coming (according to the Old and New Testaments) was an indication that the end of the world, or apocalypse, was near.

The Archdiocese of Los Angeles (, ) is an archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. state of California. Based in Los Angeles, the archdiocese comprises the California counties of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Ventura. The cathedral is the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles, and its present archbishop is Jos√© Horacio G√≥mez. With approximately five million professing members, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles is numerically the single largest diocese in the United States. The Archbishop of Los Angeles also serves as metropolitan bishop of the suffragan dioceses within the Ecclesiastical Province of Los Angeles, which includes the dioceses of Fresno, Monterey, Orange, San Bernardino, and San Diego. Following the establishment of the Spanish missions in California, the diocese of the Two Californias was established on 1840, when the Los Angeles region was still part of Mexico. In 1848, Mexican California was ceded to the United States, and the U.S. portion of the diocese was renamed the Diocese of Monterey. The diocese was renamed the Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles in 1859, and the episcopal see was moved to Los Angeles upon the completion of the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana in 1876. Los Angeles split from Monterey to become the Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego in 1922. The diocese was split again in 1936 to create the Diocese of San Diego, and the Los Angeles see was elevated to an archdiocese. The archdiocese's present territory was established in 1976, when Orange County was split off to establish the Diocese of Orange. History With the papal bull Apostolicam sollicitudinem of 27 April 1840, Pope Gregory XVI set up a new episcopal see, to which he gave the name of Diocese of California (also interchangeably called \\"Diocese of Two Californias\\" or \\"Diocese of Both Californias\\"). He assigned to it a vast territory taken from that of the Diocese of Sonora, now the Archdiocese of Hermosillo in Mexico. It included Alta California (corresponding to the present-day states of California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, western Colorado and southwestern Wyoming) and the Baja California Territory (the modern Mexican states of Baja California and Baja California Sur). He set the episcopal residence at San Diego and made the diocese a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Mexico City.The Papal Bull Apostolicam sollicitudinem, in Raffaele de Martinis, Iuris pontificii de propaganda fide. Pars prima, Tomus V, Romae 1890, pp. 233‚Äì235] Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno, OFM became the first bishop of the new diocese, with Mission Santa Barbara serving as its pro-cathedral. After ceding Alta California to the United States after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the government of Mexico objected to a United States-based bishop having jurisdiction over parishes in Mexican Baja California. The Holy See divided the diocese into American and Mexican sections and, on 20 November 1849, with the episcopal residence moved to Monterey, a more central position for the new diocese, the American section became the Diocese of Monterey.Greg Erlandson, Editor in Chief, _et al_ , Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Almanac, 2015 Edition, Our Sunday Visitor, Inc., Huntington, Inc., 2015, p. 378. The Royal Presidio Chapel in Monterey served as the pro-cathedral of the American diocese. In 1853, Pope Pius IX erected the Metropolitan Archdiocese of San Francisco, taking the territory that now constitutes Nevada, Utah, and much of northern California from the diocese and making the diocese a suffragan thereof. In 1859, the same pope renamed of the diocese to Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles to recognize the growth of the city of Los Angeles. The bishop moved his principal residence to Los Angeles and to the new Cathedral of Saint Vibiana opened in 1876. On June 1, 1922, Pope Pius XI renamed the diocese again, making it the Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego, and simultaneously erected a new diocese, named the Diocese of Monterey-Fresno, in what became northern portion of its territory after the erection of the Archdiocese of San Francisco.Ibid., p. 378. This changed the title of Bishop John Joseph Cantwell from Bishop of Monterey-Los Angeles to bishop Los Angeles-San Diego, which then comprised the counties of Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. On July 11, 1936, the same pope elevated and renamed the diocese as the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Los Angeles, with John Joseph Cantwell becoming the first Archbishop of Los Angeles.Ibid., p. 379 He concurrently erected the Diocese of San DiegoIbid., p. 382. with the territory of Imperial, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego Counties, and designated the new Diocese of San Diego and the Diocese of Monterey-Fresno as suffragan of the new metropolitan see. Pope Paul VI subsequently split each of the three dioceses of the Metropolitan Province of Los Angeles into two. * On 06 October 1967, Pope Paul VI suppressed the Diocese of Monterey-Fresno and erected the present Diocese of FresnoIbid., p. 377. and the present Diocese of Monterey in CaliforniaIbid., p. 379. in the territory of the suppressed diocese, making both new dioceses also suffragans of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The inclusion of \\"in California\\" in the title of the latter of the new dioceses differentiates it from other dioceses with see cities that have the same name. * On 24 March 1976, he erected Diocese of Orange,Ibid., p. 380. taking Orange County from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and making the new diocese a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. This action also established the present territory of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, consisting of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties. * On 14 July 1978, he erected the Diocese of San Bernardino, taking San Bernardino and Riverside Counties from the Diocese of San Diego and making the new diocese also a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.Ibid., p. 382. These actions established the present configuration of the Metropolitan Province of Los Angeles. =Pastoral regions= In 1986, Archbishop Roger Mahony subdivided the Archdiocese of Los Angeles into five administrative pastoral regions. Each region is geographical, and is headed by an auxiliary bishop who functions as the region's episcopal vicar. The five regions are: *Our Lady of the Angels, covering downtown and central Los Angeles west to Malibu, south to Los Angeles International Airport. The region has 1 cathedral, 78 parishes, 10 Catholic high schools, 5 Catholic hospitals, 1 cemetery, 3 parochial missions, and no Spanish missions. The Episcopal Vicar is Bishop Edward William Clark. *San Fernando, covering the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope Valleys and northeast Los Angeles. The region has 54 parishes, 12 Catholic high schools, 2 Catholic hospitals, 2 cemeteries, 7 parochial missions, 1 active duty military chapel installation, and 1 Spanish mission. Archbishop Gomez appointed Bishop Alejandro D. Aclan Episcopal Vicar for the San Fernando Pastoral Region in 2019. *San Gabriel, covering East Los Angeles through the San Gabriel Valley and the Pomona Valley. The region has 66 parishes, 13 Catholic high schools, 3 Catholic hospitals, 4 cemeteries, 2 parochial missions and 1 Spanish mission. Archbishop Gomez appointed Bishop David G. O'Connell Episcopal Vicar for the San Gabriel Pastoral Region in 2015. *San Pedro, covering Long Beach and southern Los Angeles County. The region has 67 parishes, 9 Catholic high schools, 6 Catholic hospitals, 1 cemetery, 1 active duty military chapel installation, and 1 parochial mission. Archbishop Gomez appointed Bishop Marc V. Trudeau as the Episcopal Vicar for this region in 2018. *Santa Barbara, covering Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. The region has 37 parishes, 6 Catholic high schools, 3 Catholic hospitals, 4 cemeteries, 3 active duty military chapel installations, 6 parochial missions and 4 Spanish missions. Archbishop Gomez appointed Bishop Robert E. Barron Episcopal Vicar for the Santa Barbara Pastoral Region in 2015. =Clergy sexual abuse settlements= On July 16, 2007, Cardinal Roger Mahony and the archdiocese reached a record-breaking settlement with 508 alleged victims of sexual abuse by priests. The settlement was worth $660 million, with an average of $1.3 million for each plaintiff. Mahony described the abuse as a \\"terrible sin and crime\\", after a series of trials into sex abuse claims since the 1940s were to begin. The agreement settled all outstanding civil lawsuits against the archdiocese and dwarfs the $157 million settlement paid by the Archdiocese of Boston since Massachusetts law places a legal dollar cap on how much money a non-profit group can be required to pay. In 2014 the diocese agreed to pay $13 million to settle a final group of 17 sex abuse lawsuits, including eleven that involved \\"a visiting Mexican priest who fled prosecution and remains a fugitive more than 25 years later\\". The settlement followed a court order forcing the Archdiocese to release files which showed that it had shielded accused priests, for example by ordering church officials not to turn over a list of altar boys to police who were investigating. From May to December 2019, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles provided numerous documents to California State Attorney Xavier Becerra in preparation for a series of pending lawsuits which are expected to be filed after a new California law which will temporarily remove the statute of limitations. The new law goes into effect on January 1, 2020. The Archdiocese of Los Angeles is one of six Catholic dioceses throughout the state of California which is expected to be subpoenaed during the upcoming lawsuits. Archbishop The Most Reverend John J. Cantwell, first Archbishop of Los Angeles The archdiocese is led by the archbishop, who governs from the mother church, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. The cathedral was dedicated on September 2, 2002, and replaced the former Cathedral of Saint Vibiana, damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The Archbishop of Los Angeles is the metropolitan of the Province of Los Angeles of the Roman Catholic Church. Its suffragans are the dioceses of Fresno, Monterey in California, Orange in California, San Bernardino, and San Diego. Metropolitan archbishops historically wielded great administrative powers over the suffragan dioceses. Today, such power is only ceremonial and kept as a tradition. The Most Reverend Jos√© H. G√≥mez is the current Archbishop of Los Angeles, having automatically succeeded his predecessor, Cardinal Roger Mahony, who served for 25 years, upon the latter's retirement which took effect on March 1, 2011.\\"Cardinal Mahony Retires\\" Retrieved: 2011-02-27. Previously, G√≥mez served as Coadjutor Archbishop of Los Angeles since his appointment by Pope Benedict XVI on April 6, 2010.Press Office of the Holy See He previously served as Archbishop of San Antonio from 2004 to 2010, and as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Denver from 2001 to 2004. He is an ordained priest of Opus Dei. Archbishop G√≥mez is assisted by the current auxiliary bishops: Edward W. Clark, David O'Connell, Robert Barron, Marc Vincent Trudeau, and Alejandro D. Aclan. In addition, Joseph Martin Sartoris and Gerald Eugene Wilkerson are retired auxiliary bishops still living and residing within the archdiocese. Gordon Bennett, S.J., Bishop Emeritus of Mandeville, Jamaica, also resides within the archdiocese, as the Peter Faber, S.J., Fellow in Pastoral Theology and Ignatian Spirituality at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.

Each year since 2011, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels has hosted a Votive Mass in honor of Our Lady, Queen of Angels. The Mass follows a Marian procession which originates from the historic Queen of Angels parish, which is part of the Los Angeles Plaza Historic District, and culminates at the cathedral. Since 2011 the Queen of Angels Foundation has sponsored the annual Marian processions, Votive Masses, and fiestas in commemoration of Los Angeles' birthday and the feast of Our Lady of the Angels. Archbishop Gomez has been the homilist and principal celebrant of the annual Mass since 2012. Future Marian processions and Masses will coincide with the City of Los Angeles' official birthday celebrations on the last Saturday of August. Holy days of obligation As directed by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on the Liturgy and the Ecclesiastical Province of Los Angeles, the archdiocese annually observes four holy days of obligation. The Roman Catholic Church currently recognizes 10 holy days, established in the 1917 Code of Canon Law. However, the USCCB has reduced that number to 6 for Latin Church dioceses in the United States. , no provinces in the United States celebrate the solemnities of Epiphany (which transfers to the Sunday after January 1), Corpus Christi (which transfers to the Sunday after Trinity Sunday), Saint Joseph, or the Saints Peter and Paul, Apostles as holy days of obligation. The Metropolitan Province of Los Angeles, which includes the L.A. Archdiocese, further modified the list, and , celebrates four holy days of obligation on the days prescribed by canon law. The solemnity of the Ascension is transferred from Thursday of the sixth week of Easter to the seventh Sunday of Easter. The province has abrogated the obligation to attend Mass on the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God. *Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, August 15 **Exception: If August 15 falls on a Saturday or Monday, there is no obligation to attend Mass. *All Saints, November 1 **Exception: If November 1 falls on a Saturday or Monday, there is no obligation to attend Mass. *Immaculate Conception, December 8 **Exception: If December 8 falls on a Sunday, the solemnity is transferred to the following Monday and there is no obligation to attend Mass. *Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, December 25  Administrative handbook  The Archdiocese of Los Angeles, being one of the most diverse dioceses in the world, strives for all of their employees to live and work in accord with Catholic social teaching and servant leadership. \\"The dignity of the human person, the call to community and participation, rights and responsibilities, dignity of work and the rights of workers, and solidarity, are intrinsic to servant leadership.\\" In an attempt to provide better service and to increase transparency the Archdiocese of Los Angeles is the only archdiocese that has a completely updated and searchable administrative handbook available online.

Life and education  Lindemann was born in Hanover, the capital of the Kingdom of Hanover. His father, Ferdinand Lindemann, taught modern languages at a Gymnasium in Hanover. His mother, Emilie Crusius, was the daughter of the Gymnasium's headmaster. The family later moved to Schwerin, where young Ferdinand attended school. He studied mathematics at G√∂ttingen, Erlangen, and Munich. At Erlangen he received a doctorate, supervised by Felix Klein, on non-Euclidean geometry. Lindemann subsequently taught in W√ºrzburg and at the University of Freiburg. During his time in Freiburg, Lindemann devised his proof that is a transcendental number (see Lindemann‚ÄìWeierstrass theorem). After his time in Freiburg, Lindemann transferred to the University of K√∂nigsberg. While a professor in K√∂nigsberg, Lindemann acted as supervisor for the doctoral theses of the mathematicians David Hilbert, Hermann Minkowski, and Arnold Sommerfeld.  Transcendence proof  In 1882, Lindemann published the result for which he is best known, the transcendence of . His methods were similar to those used nine years earlier by Charles Hermite to show that e, the base of natural logarithms, is transcendental. Before the publication of Lindemann's proof, it was known that if was transcendental, then it would be impossible to square the circle by compass and straightedge. In popular culture In xkcd comic 866, Ferdinand von Lindemann is referenced in the alt-text, apparently having used a compass and straightedge to construct the greatest birthday party ever, to which nobody showed up.

First archon  The first Megacles was possibly a legendary archon of Athens from 922 BC to 892 BC. Archon eponymous The second Megacles was a member of the Alcmaeonidae family, and the archon eponymous in 632 BC when Cylon made his unsuccessful attempt to take over Athens. Megacles was convicted of killing Cylon's supporters (who had taken refuge on the Acropolis as suppliants of Athena) and was exiled from the city, along with all the other members of his genos, the Alcmaeonidae. The Alcmaeonidae inherited a miasma (\\"stain\\") that lasted for generations among Megacles' descendants.  Alcmaeonidae  The third Megacles, the grandson of the above eponymous Archon, son of Alcmaeon and member of the Alcmaeonidae family, was an opponent of Pisistratus in the 6th century BC. He drove out Pisistratus during the latter's first reign as tyrant in 560 BC, but the two then made an alliance with each other, and Pisistratus married Megacles' daughter. Herodotus says that they also tricked the Athenians into believing Athena herself had arrived to proclaim Pisistratus tyrant, by dressing up a woman named Phye as the goddess, although Herodotus himself casts doubt on the truth of this story.Herodotus 1.60 However, Megacles turned against Pisistratus when Pisistratus refused to have children with Megacles' daughter, which brought an end to the second tyranny.Herodotus 1.61 This Megacles earlier had competed with Hippocleides, a future archon of Athens, to marry Agarista, the daughter of Cleisthenes of Sicyon. They had two sons. The elder was Hippocrates, whose children were another Megacles (ostracized 486 BC) and a daughter Agariste, the mother of Pericles and Ariphron (himself the father of Hippocrates of Athens who died 424 BC). The younger son was Cleisthenes, who was allegedly the grandfather of Deinomache (or Dinomache), mother of Alcibiades (d. 404 BC). Thus, Megacles the elder was great-grandfather of Pericles and the great-great-grandfather of Alcibiades. Marathon Battle The fourth Megacles, grandson of the above, son of Hippocrates, and nephew of Cleisthenes is sometimes described as the father of Deinomache and thus the maternal grandfather of Alcibiades. Other sources, notably William Smith, insist that his uncle Cleisthenes was the grandfather of Alcibiades. In 490 BC, in the aftermath of the Battle of Marathon, a shield-signal was raised on Mount Pentelicon above Marathon supposedly to signal the Persians to sail around Cape Sounion and attack the unguarded city of Athens. Herodotus reports that the Alcmaeonidae were widely believed to have been behind this act of treachery.Herodotus 6.124 With Megacles being the leading figure of the Alcmaeonid clan at the time, a lingering suspicion of medism hung over him. Ostraka against Megacles In 486 BC Megacles was ostracised. Numerous ostraca have been found with comments on them making reference to his ostentatious wealth and love of luxury.Exile, ostracism, and democracy: the politics of expulsion in ancient Greece - Sara Forsdyke (Princeton University Press), 2005 - pg 155 He was honored by Pindar as exiled winner in the chariot race of Pythian Games 486 BC.Pythian eleven By Pindar, Patrick Finglass Page 25  Megacles of Epirus  Megacles of Epirus was an officer in the service of Pyrrhus of Epirus, who accompanied that monarch on his expedition to Italy, 280 BC. He is mentioned as accompanying Pyrrhus when he reconnoitered the Roman camp previous to the battle of Heraclea ; and in that action was the means of saving the king's life, by exchanging armour with him, and thus directing the efforts of the assailants upon himself, instead of Pyrrhus. He fell a victim to his devotion, being slain by a Roman named Publius Decius Mus. Bibliography * Monica Berti, \\"L‚Äôantroponimo Megakles sugli ostraka di Atene.

From the 1870s to the 1960s, dude primarily meant a person who dressed in an extremely fashionable manner (a dandy) or a conspicuous citified person who was visiting a rural location, a \\"city slicker\\". In the 1960s, dude evolved to mean any male person, a meaning that slipped into mainstream American slang in the 1970s. Current slang retains at least some use of all three of these common meanings. History Evander Berry Wall, a New York socialite, was dubbed \\"King of the Dudes\\". He is pictured (1888) in the New York American newspaper at the time of the \\"battle of the Dudes\\".Jeffers, Harry Paul (2005). Diamond Jim Brady: Prince of the Gilded Age, p.45. John Wiley and Sons. The term \\"dude\\" may also have derived from the 18th-century word \\"doodle\\", as in \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\". In the popular press of the 1880s and 1890s, \\"dude\\" was a new word for \\"dandy\\"‚Äîan \\"extremely well-dressed male\\", a man who paid particular importance to how he appeared. The caf√© society and Bright Young Things of the late 1800s and early 1900s were populated with dudes. Young men of leisure vied to show off their wardrobes. The best known of this type is probably Evander Berry Wall, who was dubbed \\"King of the Dudes\\" in 1880s New York and maintained a reputation for sartorial splendor all his life. This version of the word is still in occasional use in American slang, as in the phrase \\"all duded up\\" for getting dressed in fancy clothes. Among the first published descriptions defining \\"dude\\"; Chicago Tribune, 25 February 1883The word was used to refer to Easterners and referred to a man with \\"store-bought clothes\\". The word was used by cowboys to unfavorably refer to the city dwellers. A variation of this was a \\"well-dressed man who is unfamiliar with life outside a large city\\". In The Home and Farm Manual (1883), author Jonathan Periam used the term \\"dude\\" several times to denote an ill-bred and ignorant, but ostentatious, man from the city. The implication of an individual who is unfamiliar with the demands of life outside of urban settings gave rise to the definition of dude as a \\"city slicker\\", or \\"an Easterner in the [United States] West\\". Thus \\"dude\\" was used to describe the wealthy men of the expansion of the United States during the 19th century by ranch-and-homestead-bound settlers of the American Old West. This use is reflected in the dude ranch, a guest ranch catering to urbanites seeking more rural experiences. Dude ranches began to appear in the American West in the early 20th century, for wealthy Easterners who came to experience the \\"cowboy life\\". The implicit contrast is with those persons accustomed to a given frontier, agricultural, mining, or other rural setting. This usage of \\"dude\\" was still in use in the 1950s in America, as a word for a tourist‚Äîof either gender‚Äîwho attempts to dress like the local culture but fails. An inverse of these uses of \\"dude\\" would be the term \\"redneck,\\" a contemporary American colloquialism referring to poor farmers and uneducated persons, which itself became pejorative, and is also still in use.Harold Wentworth, and Stuart Berg Flexner, Dictionary of American Slang (1975) p. 424.\\"Redneck\\". Dictionary.com.Barbara Ann Kipfer and Robert L. Chapman, American Slang (2008), p. 404. As the word gained popularity and reached the coasts of the U.S. and traveled between borders, variations of the slang began to pop up such as the female versions of dudette and dudines; however, they were short lived due to dude also gaining a neutral gender connotation and some linguists see the female versions as more artificial slang. The slang eventually had gradual decline in usage until the early to mid 20th century when other subcultures of the U.S. began using it more frequently while again deriving it from the type of dress and eventually using it as a descriptor for common male and sometimes female companions. Eventually, lower class schools with a greater mix of subcultures allowed the word to spread to almost all cultures and eventually up the class ladders to become common use in the U.S. By the late 20th to early 21st century, dude had gained the ability to be used in the form of expression, whether that be disappointment, excitement, or loving and it also widened to be able to refer to any general person no matter race, gender, or culture. The term was also used as a \\"job description\\", such as \\"bush hook dude\\" as a position on a railroad in the 1880s. For an example, see the Stampede Tunnel. In the early 1960s, dude became prominent in surfer culture as a synonym of guy or fella. The female equivalent was \\"dudette\\" or \\"dudess\\". but these have both fallen into disuse and \\"dude\\" is now also used as a unisex term. This more general meaning of \\"dude\\" started creeping into the mainstream in the mid-1970s. \\"Dude\\", particularly in surfer and \\"bro\\" culture, is generally used informally to address someone (\\"Dude, I'm glad you finally called\\") or refer to another person (\\"I've seen that dude around here before\\"). One of the first known references to the word in American film was in the 1969 movie Easy Rider where Wyatt (portrayed by Peter Fonda) explains to his cellmate lawyer (portrayed by Jack Nicholson) the definition of \\"dude\\": \\"Dude means nice guy; Dude means regular sort of person.\\" The usage of the word to mean a \\"cool person\\" was further popularized in American films of the 1980s and 1990s such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Wayne's World, and Clerks. The 1998 film The Big Lebowski featured Jeff Bridges as \\"The Dude\\", described as a \\"lazy deadbeat\\". The character was largely inspired by activist and producer Jeff Dowd who has been called \\"Dude\\" since childhood. The film's central character inspired the creation of Dudeism, a neoreligion. The 2000 film Dude, Where's My Car? uses the word in the title. In 2008, Bud Light aired an advertising campaign in which the dialogue consists entirely of different inflections of \\"Dude!\\" and does not mention the product by name. It was a followup to their near-identical and more widely noted \\"Whassup?\\" campaign. On 23 July 2019 Boris Johnson popularized the word \\"dude\\" as an acronym for his Conservative Party leadership campaign. In his leadership speech he explained it as referring to Deliver Brexit ‚Äì Unite the country ‚Äì Defeat Jeremy Corbyn ‚Äì Energize the country.

Standing high and wide, it is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous fountains in the world. The fountain has appeared in several notable films, including Roman Holiday (1953), the eponymous Three Coins in the Fountain (1954), Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1960), and The Lizzie McGuire Movie (2003). History before 1629 The fountain at the junction of three roads ()Though other etymologies have been suggested, this is the straightforward modern etymology adopted by Pinto 1986 and others. marks the terminal pointThe technical Italian term for such a \\"terminal fountain\\" is a (\\"display\\"): Peter J.

In 19 BC, supposedly with the help of a virgin, Roman technicians located a source of pure water some from the city. (This scene is presented on the present fountain's fa√ßade.) However, the eventual indirect route of the aqueduct made its length some . This led the water into the Baths of Agrippa. It served Rome for more than 400 years. Commission, construction, and design In 1629, Pope Urban VIII, finding the earlier fountain insufficiently dramatic, asked Gian Lorenzo Bernini to sketch possible renovations, but the project was abandoned when the pope died. Though Bernini's project was never constructed, there are many Bernini touches in the fountain as it exists today. An early, influential model by Pietro da Cortona, preserved in the Albertina, Vienna, also exists, as do various early 18th century sketches, most unsigned, as well as a project attributed to Nicola MichettiJohn A. Pinto, \\"An Early Project by Nicola Michetti for the Trevi Fountain\\" The Burlington Magazine 119 No. 897 (December 1977:853‚Äì857). one attributed to Ferdinando Fuga and a French design by Edm√© Bouchardon. Competitions had become popular during the Baroque era to design buildings, fountains, as well as the Spanish Steps. In 1730, Pope Clement XII organized a contest in which Nicola Salvi initially lost to Alessandro Galilei ‚Äì but due to the outcry in Rome over a Florentine having won, Salvi was awarded the commission anyway. Work began in 1732. Salvi died in 1751 with his work half finished, but he had made sure a barber's unsightly sign would not spoil the ensemble, hiding it behind a sculpted vase, called by Romans the asso di coppe, the \\"Ace of Cups\\", because of its resemblance to a Tarot card. Four different sculptors were hired to complete the fountain's decorations: Pietro Bracci (whose statue of Oceanus sits in the central niche), Filippo della Valle, Giovanni Grossi, and Andrea Bergondi. Giuseppe Pannini was hired as architect. The Trevi Fountain was finished in 1762 by Pannini, who substituted the present allegories for planned sculptures of Agrippa and Trivia, the Roman virgin. It was officially opened and inaugurated on 22 May by Pope Clement XIII. The majority of the piece is made from Travertine stone, quarried near Tivoli, about east of Rome. Restoration The fountain was refurbished once in 1988 to remove discoloration caused by smog, and again in 1998; the stonework was scrubbed and all cracks and other areas of deterioration were repaired by skilled artisans, and the fountain was equipped with recirculating pumps. In January 2013, it was announced that the Italian fashion company Fendi would sponsor a 20-month, 2.2-million-euro restoration of the fountain; it was to be the most thorough restoration in the fountain's history. Restoration work began in June 2014 and was completed in November 2015. The fountain was reopened with an official ceremony on the evening of 3 November 2015. The restoration included the installation of more than 100 LED lights to improve the nighttime illumination of the fountain. Iconography The backdrop for the fountain is the Palazzo Poli, given a new fa√ßade with a giant order of Corinthian pilasters that link the two main stories. Taming of the waters is the theme of the gigantic scheme that tumbles forward, mixing water and rockwork, and filling the small square. Tritons guide Oceanus' shell chariot, taming hippocamps. In the centre, a robustly-modelled triumphal arch is superimposed on the palazzo fa√ßade. The centre niche or exedra framing Oceanus has free-standing columns for maximal light and shade. In the niches flanking Oceanus, Abundance spills water from her urn and Salubrity holds a cup from which a snake drinks. Above, bas reliefs illustrate the Roman origin of the aqueducts. The Tritons and horses provide symmetrical balance, with the maximum contrast in their mood and poses (by 1730, rococo was already in full bloom in France and Germany). Coin throwing Coins are purportedly meant to be thrown using the right hand over the left shoulder. This was the theme of 1954's Three Coins in the Fountain and the Academy Award-winning song by that name which introduced the picture. An estimated 3,000 euros are thrown into the fountain each day. In 2016, an estimated ‚Ç¨1.4 million (US$1.5 million) was thrown into the fountain. The money has been used to subsidize a supermarket for Rome's needy; however, there are regular attempts to steal coins from the fountain, even though it is illegal to do so.

The fiord is most commonly accessed via road (State Highway 94) by tour coach, with the road terminating at a small village also called Milford Sound. Etymology Milford Sound is named after Milford Haven in Wales, while the Cleddau River which flows into the sound is also named for its Welsh namesake. The MƒÅori named the sound Piopiotahi after the thrush-like piopio bird, now extinct. Piopiotahi means \\"a single piopio\\", harking back to the legend of MƒÅui trying to win immortality for mankind‚Äîwhen Maui died in the attempt, a piopio was said to have flown here in mourning.The Flight of Maui (from the 'artfind.co.nz' website. Accessed 18 April 2008.) Geography As a fiord, Milford Sound was formed by a process of glaciation over millions of years. The village at the end of the fiord is also known as Milford Sound. Milford Sound runs 15 kilometres inland from the Tasman Sea at Dale Point (also named after a location close to Milford Haven in Wales)‚Äîthe mouth of the fiord‚Äîand is surrounded by sheer rock faces that rise or more on either side.

They are fed by rain water drenched moss and will last a few days at most once the rain stops. =Climate= With a mean annual rainfall of each year, a high level even for the West Coast, Milford Sound is known as the wettest inhabited place in New Zealand and one of the wettest in the world. Rainfall can reach during a span of 24 hours. The rainfall creates dozens of temporary waterfalls (as well as a number of major, more permanent ones) cascading down the cliff faces, some reaching a thousand metres in length. Smaller falls from such heights may never reach the bottom of the sound, drifting away in the wind. Accumulated rainwater can, at times, cause portions of the rain forest to lose their grip on the sheer cliff faces, resulting in tree avalanches into the fiord. The regrowth of the rain forest after these avalanches can be seen in several locations along the sound. =Wildlife= Bottlenose dolphins swim under rainbow. Milford Sound is home to a variety of marine mammals, including Seals and the southernmost wild population of bottlenose dolphins. Whales, especially the humpback and southern right whales, are increasingly observed due to recoveries of each species. Penguins are also common within the sound, which is a breeding site for the Fiordland penguin and has subsequently been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International.BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Milford Sound. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 18 February 2012. As a result of Milford Sound's high rainfall and the density of saltwater, the surface of Milford Sound is a layer of freshwater containing tannins from the surrounding rainforest. This filters much of the sunlight which enters the water, allowing for a variety of Black coral to be found at depths of as shallow as 10 metres, significantly closer to the surface than usual. History John Gibb, oil on canvas Christchurch 1886 The Stirling Falls were named after Frederick Stirling, Captain of . Milford Sound was initially overlooked by European explorers, because its narrow entry did not appear to lead into such large interior bays. Sailing ship captains such as James Cook, who bypassed Milford Sound on his journeys for just this reason, also feared venturing too close to the steep mountainsides, afraid that wind conditions would prevent escape. The fiord was a playground for local MƒÅori who had acquired a large amount of local marine knowledge including tidal patterns and fish feeding patterns over generations prior to European arrival. The fiord remained undiscovered by Europeans until Captain John Grono discovered it c.1812 and named it Milford Haven after his homeland in Wales. Captain John Lort Stokes later renamed Milford Haven as Milford Sound.Terry Hearn. Welsh ‚Äì Milford Sound, Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, Ministry of Culture and Heritage. Updated 4 March 2009. Accessed 3 February 2010. Following the passage of the NgƒÅi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the name of the fiord was officially altered to Milford Sound / Piopiotahi. While Fiordland as such remained one of the least-explored areas of New Zealand up to the 20th century, Milford Sound's natural beauty soon attracted national and international renown, and led to the discovery of the Mackinnon Pass in 1888, soon to become a part of the new Milford Track, an early walking tourism trail. In the same year, the low watershed saddle between the Hollyford River and the Cleddau River was discovered, where the Homer Tunnel was to be developed about sixty years later to provide road access.Fiordland (from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Accessed 6 February 2008.) As of the 2006 census, just 120 people lived in Milford Sound, most of them working in tourism or conservation. Tourism Cliffs and waterfalls after dry spell, with a two-storey tour boat providing relative size Mitre Peak, towering over Milford Sound =Overview= Milford Sound attracts between 550,000 and 1 million visitors per year.\\"Over and Under: Linking Queenstown and Milford Sound\\". e.nz magazine, IPENZ, May/June 2007 This makes the sound one of New Zealand's most-visited tourist spots even with its remote location and long journey times from the nearest population centres. Many tourists take one of the boat tours which usually last one to two hours. They are offered by several companies, departing from the Milford Sound Visitors' Centre. Tramping, canoeing, and some other water sports are possible. A small number of companies also provide overnight boat trips. There is otherwise only limited accommodation at the sound, and only a very small percentage of tourists stay more than the day. Tourists usually stay in Te Anau or Queenstown. The Milford Discovery Centre & Underwater Observatory is located in Harrisons Cove on the north side of the fiord. Situated within the Piopiotahi Marine Reserve, the underwater observatory allows visitors to view the fiord's unique marine environment at a depth of 10 metres. Due to a natural phenomenon called 'deep water emergence,' deep-water animals such as black coral can be viewed in the shallow waters surrounding the observatory.Erika Delemarre, Milford Discovery Centre nature guide, tour presentation material 2014‚Äì2015.

Updated 21 September 2007. Accessed 18 April 2008. Milford Sound is also a destination for cruise ships. =Transport= By road, Milford Sound is from Queenstown and from Invercargill (about four hours' drive), with most of the tour buses to the sound departing from Queenstown. Some tourists also arrive from the smaller tourism centre of Te Anau, away. There are also scenic flights by light aircraft and helicopter tours to and from Milford Sound Airport. The drive to Milford Sound itself passes through unspoiled mountain landscapes before entering the Homer Tunnel which emerges into rain-forest-carpeted canyons that descend to the sound. The winding mountain road, while of high standards, is very prone to avalanches and closures during the winter half of the year. The long distance to the sound means that tourist operators from Queenstown all depart very early in the day, arriving back only late in the evening. This ensures that most tourists visit Milford Sound within a few hours around midday, leading to some congestion on the roads and at the tourist facilities during the main season. The peak-time demand is also the reason for the large number of tour boats active in the sound at much the same time. Over the years, various options of shortening the distance to Milford Sound from Queenstown have been mooted, including a gondola route, a new tunnel from Queenstown, or a monorail from near Lake Wakatipu to Te Anau Downs. All would reduce the current round-trip duration (which has to travel via Te Anau), thus allowing tourism to be spread out over more of the day. While a gondola is considered to be out of the running after the DOC declined approval for environmental reasons, the tunnel and the monorail proposals have applied to the Department of Conservation for concessions for land access. There are a variety of plane charter companies that fly to Milford Sound. Most of the companies fly out of Queenstown International Airport. These companies include: True South Flights, Glenorchy Air, Air Milford, and Milford Sound Scenic Flights. Diesel spill On 8 February 2004 a spill of 13,000 litres of diesel fuel was discovered, resulting in a 2-kilometre spill which closed the fiord for two days while intensive cleanup activities were completed. Apparently a hose was used to displace the fuel from the tanks of one of the tour vessels, and various government officials claimed it appeared to be an act of ecoterrorism motivated by rising numbers of tourists to the park,\\"Police probe Milford diesel spill 'terrorism, New Zealand Herald, 10 February 2004 though more details did not become known.

The region that includes the Seto Inland Sea and the coastal areas of Honsh≈´, Shikoku, and Ky≈´sh≈´ is known as the Setouchi Region. It serves as a waterway connecting the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan. It connects to Osaka Bay and provides a sea transport link to industrial centers in the Kansai region, including Osaka and Kobe. Before the construction of the San'y≈ç Main Line, it was the main transportation link between Kansai and Ky≈´sh≈´. Yamaguchi, Hiroshima, Okayama, Hy≈çgo, Osaka, Wakayama, Kagawa, Ehime, Tokushima, Fukuoka, and ≈åita prefectures all have coastlines on the Seto Inland Sea; the cities of Hiroshima, Iwakuni, Takamatsu, and Matsuyama are also located on it. The Setouchi region is known for its moderate climate, with a stable year-round temperature and relatively low rainfall levels. The sea is famous for its periodic caused by dense groupings of certain phytoplankton that result in the death of large numbers of fish. Since the 1980s, the sea's northern and southern shores have been connected by the three routes of the Honsh≈´‚ÄìShikoku Bridge Project, including the Great Seto Bridge, which serves both railroad and automobile traffic.

The range of the Seto Inland Sea according to the Setouchi Law and the Setouchi Law Enforcement Order is . Geographical features The beauty of the islands of the Seto Inland Sea, Suo-Oshima, Yamaguchi Prefecture The Seto Inland Sea is 450 km (280 mi) long from east to west. The width from south to north varies from 15 to 55 km (10 to 34 mi). In most places, the water is relatively shallow. The average depth is 38 m (125 ft); the greatest depth is 105 m (344 ft). Hydrologically, Setouchi is not a true inland sea, being neither an epeiric body of water like Hudson Bay nor an isolated endorheic basin like the Caspian Sea. Rather, it is actually a marginal sea; a division of a wider ocean (in this case the Pacific) which is partially enclosed by islands, archipelagos, or peninsulas, (here, the Japanese Home Islands) adjacent to or widely open to the open ocean at the surface. The Naruto Strait connects the eastern part of the Seto Inland Sea to the Kii Channel, which in turn connects to the Pacific. The western part of the Seto Inland Sea connects to the Sea of Japan through the Kanmon Straits and to the Pacific through the Bungo Channel. Each part of the Seto Inland Sea has a separate name in Japanese. For example, refers to the strait between Ehime, Yamaguchi, and ≈åita prefectures in the western portion of the sea; is the open expanse west of the Geiyo Islands, near Hiroshima prefecture; and refers to the expanse between Yamaguchi prefecture and Su≈ç-≈åshima. There are also many straits located between the major islands, as well as a number of smaller ones that pass between islands or connect the Seto Inland Sea to other seas or the Pacific. Almost 3,000 islands are located in the Seto Inland Sea. The largest island is Awaji-shima, and the second largest is Sh≈çdo-shima. Many of the smaller islands are uninhabited. =Major islands= *Eastern part: Awaji Island, Sh≈çdo Island, Ieshima Islands, Naoshima Islands, Shiwaku Islands, Yumeshima *Central part: ≈åmishima, Innoshima, Itsukushima (popularly known as Miyajima), Hinase Islands, Kasaoka Islands *Western part: Su≈ç-≈åshima, Uwakai Islands, Hashira-jima Islands. Fauna Over 500 marine species are known to live in the Seto Inland Sea. Examples are the ayu, an amphidromous fish, horseshoe crab, finless porpoise, and great white shark, which has occasionally attacked people in the Seto Inland Sea. In the past, whales entered the sea to feed or breed, however because of whaling and pollution, they are rarely seen. History Seto Inland Sea seen from the Torii of Itsukushima Shrine During the last ice age the sea level was lower than today. After the ice age, sea water poured into a basin between the Ch≈´goku mountains and Shikoku mountains and formed the Seto Inland Sea as we know it today. From ancient times, the Seto Inland Sea served as a main transport line between its coastal areas, including what is today the Kansai region and Ky≈´sh≈´. It was also a main transport line between Japan and other countries, including Korea and China. Even after the creation of major highways such as the Nankaid≈ç and San'y≈çd≈ç, the Seto Inland Sea remained a major transport route. There are records that some foreign emissaries from China and Korea sailed on the Seto Inland Sea. The importance of water traffic gave rise to private navies in the region. In many documents, these navies were called , or simply pirates. Sometimes they were considered to be public enemies, but in most cases they were granted the right to self-governance as a result of their strength. During the feudal period, suigun seized power in most coastal areas. The Kono in Iyo Province (today Ehime Prefecture) and Kobayakawa (later M≈çri) in Aki Province (today a part of Hiroshima Prefecture) clans were two of the more famous suigun lords. In the 12th century, Taira no Kiyomori planned to move the capital from Kyoto to the coastal village of Fukuhara (today Kobe) to promote trade between Japan and the Song dynasty of China. This transfer was unsuccessful, and soon after Kyoto became the capital again. Later, the Battle of Yashima took place off the coast of present-day Takamatsu. In the Edo period, the Seto Inland Sea was one of the busiest transport lines in Japan. It was a part of a navigational route around Japan's islands via the Sea of Japan. Many ships navigated from its coastal areas to the area along the Sea of Japan. Major ports in the Edo period were Osaka, Sakai, Shimotsui, Ushimado, and Tomonoura. The Seto Inland Sea also served many daimy≈çs in the western area of Japan as their route to and from Edo, to fulfill their obligations under sankin-k≈çtai. Many used ships from Osaka. Thanks to transport through the Seto Inland Sea, Osaka became the economic center of Japan. Each han had an office called Ozakayashiki in Osaka. These Ozakayashiki were among Japan's earliest forms of banks, facilitating domestic trade and helping to organize the income of the daimyo, which was in the form of koku, giant bales of rice. The Seto Inland Sea was also part of the official Chosendentsushi route, bringing Korean emissaries to the shogunate. After the Meiji Restoration, the coastal cities along the Seto Inland Sea were rapidly industrialized. One of the headquarters of the Japanese Navy was built in the town of Kure. Since the Meiji period, development of land transport has been reducing the importance of the Seto Inland Sea as a transport line. Remarkable land transportation innovations include the San'y≈ç Main Railroad Line in Honsh≈´ and the Yosan Main Railroad Line in Shikoku (both completed before World War II) and three series of bridges connecting Honsh≈´ and Shikoku (completed in the late 20th century). The Seto Inland Sea is still used, however, by an international cargo transport line and several local transport lines connecting Honsh≈´ with Shikoku and Ky≈´sh≈´. Industry Major cities with heavy industrial activity on the coast of the Seto Inland Sea include Osaka, Kobe, and Hiroshima. Smaller scale manufacturing and industry can also be found in Kurashiki, Kure, Fukuyama, and Ube in Honsh≈´, and Sakaide, Imabari, and Niihama in Shikoku. Major industries include steel production, vehicle manufacture, ship building, textiles, and since the 1960s, oil refining and chemical products. Imabari Shipbuilding, Japan's largest ship building company, has its headquarters and some of its yards in Imabari, Ehime Prefecture. Thanks to the moderate climate and beautiful landscape, fishing, agriculture, and tourism bring a lot of income to the area as well.  Transport  Major highways in the Seto Inland Sea. Yellow: Kobe-Awaji-Naruto. Green: Seto-≈åhashi. Red: Nishiseto Expressway. KURE-MATSUYAMA ferry, Seto Inland Sea 2017 Today the Seto Inland Sea serves its coastal areas mainly for two purposes: first, international or domestic cargo transportation, and second, local transportation between coastal areas and islands on the sea. Major ports are Kobe, Okayama, Takamatsu, Tokushima, Matsuyama, and Hiroshima. Historically, the Seto Inland Sea as transport line served four coastal areas: Kansai, Ch≈´goku, Shikoku, and eastern Ky≈´sh≈´. The Seto Inland Sea provided each of these regions with local transportation and connected each region to the others and far areas, including the coastal area of the Sea of Japan, Korea, and China. After Kobe port was founded in 1868 to serve foreign ships, the Seto Inland Sea became a major international waterway with connection to the Pacific. Development of land transportation shifted the travel between east and west -- that is, between Honsh≈´ and Ky≈´sh≈´ -- to railroad and road transport. Two coastal railways, San'y≈ç Main Line in Honsh≈´ and Yosan Main Line, were built. Those railway lines stimulated the local economy and once invoked a rail mania. Many short railroads were planned to connect a certain station of those two lines and a local seaport on the Seto Inland Sea, and some of them were actually built. The Ministry of Railroads, later the Japanese National Railways and then Shikoku Railway Company, ran some train ferry lines between Honsh≈´ and Shikoku including the line between Uno Station (Tamano) and Takamatsu Station (Takamatsu). When the Great Seto Bridge was finished and began to serve the two coastal areas, that ferry line was abolished. =Highways & bridges= Akashi Kaiky≈ç Bridge The main islands Honsh≈´ and Shikoku are connected by three series of bridges since the late 1980s. This improves land transportation between the connected islands. These series of bridges, collectively known as the Honsh≈´‚ÄìShikoku Bridge Project, are, from east to west, Akashi Kaiky≈ç Bridge, Great Seto Bridge, and Nishiseto Expressway. Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Highway The easternmost highway was built between 1976 and 1998. It leads from Akashi (Hyogo prefecture) on the Akashi Kaiky≈ç Bridge (the longest suspension bridge in the world) to Awaji Island, from there via the ≈ånaruto Bridge to ≈åge-jima (Naruto, Tokushima Prefecture) beyond the 1.3-kilometer wide Naruto Strait and finally across the Muya Bridge to Shikoku. Seto Chuo Highway The Great Seto Bridge connects Okayama Prefecture with Kagawa Prefecture since 1988. It consists of a total of six two-storey bridges, whose lower floors are used by the railway (Japan Railways Group). The high speed Shinkansen does not go to or on Shikoku. Nishiseto Highway / Shimanami Highway This is the first of three intersections of the Seto Inland Sea. Construction started in 1975, but was fully completed in 1999. It connects the Nishiseto- Onomichi Highway in Hiroshima Prefecture with a total of ten bridges and several smaller islands with Imabari in Ehime Prefecture. Approximately 100,000 people live on those islands. The bridges are: Shin Onomichi Bridge, Innoshima Bridge, Ikuchi Bridge, Tatara Bridge, ≈åmishima Bridge, the two ≈åshima bridges and the three Kurushima Kaikyo bridges. The Kurushima-Kaiky≈ç Bridge connects the island of ≈åshima to the main island of Shikoku. Major tourist sites Mount Ishizuchi Mimosusogawa Park (:ja:„Åø„ÇÇ„Åô„ÅùÂ∑ùÂÖ¨Âúí) in Shimonoseki The coastal area of the Seto Inland Sea is one of the most famous tourist destinations in Japan. Even before Japan opened to foreigners in the middle of the 19th century, the sea's beauty was praised and introduced to the Western world by those who visited Japan, including Philipp Franz von Siebold, and after the country's opening, Ferdinand von Richthofen and Thomas Cook. Its coastal area, except for Osaka Prefecture and a part of Wakayama Prefecture, was appointed the on March 16, 1934, as one of three oldest national parks in Japan. Itsukushima Shrine, on the island of Itsukushima in the city of Hatsukaichi, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most famous Japanese sites outside Tokyo and Kyoto. Sh≈çdoshima, nicknamed the \\"island of olives\\", and the Naruto whirlpools are two other well-known tourist sites. Neighboring locations like Kotohira and Okayama are often combined with the tour of the Setouchi region. Some historic sites, including Yashima in Takamatsu and Kurashiki, also attract many visitors. Hiroshima is the neighbor city to Itsukushima Shrine and another UNESCO World Heritage Site because of atomic bomb damage in 1945. Idol Unit STU48 operate on a cruise on the Setuchi. The eastern end of the Sea is now famous for the Setouchi Triennale set up in 2010 with the next event happening in 2019. Some of this takes place on the island of Naoshima, known colloquially as the art island, and the home of several permanent museums. At the far eastern extremity, as the Sea meets the Pacific Ocean, are the Naruto whirlpools that can be reached by sight-seeing boats. The Shiwaku Islands are a defined group numbering 28 that can be reached by ferry boat from Marugame. Here Richard Henry Brunton built one of his lighthouses that can still be seen, and the grave of Frank Toovey Lake, a young midshipman in his survey party has become famous. In the central area of Seto Inland Sea is Mount Ishizuchi on Shikoku. It is the highest mountain in western Japan and the highest mountain in Shikoku. In the western end of the Sea is Mimosusogawa Park (:ja:„Åø„ÇÇ„Åô„ÅùÂ∑ùÂÖ¨Âúí) in Shimonoseki. It commemorates the final stage of the Genpei war between the feudal Taira clan and Minamoto clan (1180‚Äì1185). Literature Some sites along the Seto Inland Sea were featured in eighth- century Japanese literature, both in prose and in verse, including Kojiki, Nihon Shoki, and Man'y≈çsh≈´. Since some sites were used as places of exile, their feeling and landscape were evoked in waka. In fiction, in The Tale of Genji, Genji fled from Kyoto and resided in Suma (now a part of Kobe) and Akashi for two years. In medieval literature, because of the Genpei War, the Seto Inland Sea is one of the important backgrounds of The Tale of the Heike, particularly in its latter part. In the Western world, Donald Richie wrote a literary nonfiction travelogue called The Inland Sea relating a journey along the sea, beginning from the East at Himeji and ending at Miyajima in the West, close to Hiroshima, going from island to island, exploring the landscape, meeting and discussing with local people, as well as musing on Japanese culture, the nature of travel and of identity, and his own personal sense of identity. In 1991, filmmakers Lucille Carra and Brian Cotnoir produced a film version of Richie's book, which further explored the region through interviews and images photographed by Hiro Narita. Produced by Travelfilm Company and adapted by Carra, the film won numerous awards, including Best Documentary at the Hawaii International Film Festival (1991) and the Earthwatch Film Award. It screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 1992.NY Times review Koushun Takami's novel Battle Royale took place on a fictional island in the Seto Inland Sea.

It marked the shift from one constitutional monarchy, under the restored House of Bourbon, to another, the July Monarchy; the transition of power from the House of Bourbon to its cadet branch, the House of Orl√©ans; and the replacement of the principle of hereditary right by that of popular sovereignty. Supporters of the Bourbon would be called Legitimists, and supporters of Louis Philippe Orl√©anists.  Background  After Napoleonic France's defeat and surrender in May 1814, Continental Europe, and France in particular, was in a state of disarray. The Congress of Vienna met to redraw the continent's political map. Many European countries attended the Congress, but decision-making was controlled by four major powers: the United Kingdom, represented by its Foreign Secretary Viscount Castlereagh; the Austrian Empire, represented by the Chief Minister Prince Metternich; Russia, represented by Emperor Alexander I; and Prussia, represented by King Frederick William III. France's foreign minister, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, also attended the Congress. Although France was considered an enemy state, Talleyrand was allowed to attend the Congress because he claimed that he had only cooperated with Napoleon under duress. He suggested that France be restored to her \\"legitimate\\" (i.e. pre-Napoleonic) borders and governments‚Äîa plan that, with some changes, was accepted by the major powers. France was spared large annexations and returned to its 1791 borders. The House of Bourbon, deposed by the Revolution, was restored to the throne in the person of Louis XVIII. The Congress, however, forced Louis to grant a constitution, La Charte constitutionnelle. = Charles X's reign = Charles X in coronation robes, by Robert Lef√®vre On 16 September 1824, after a lingering illness of several months, the 68-year-old Louis XVIII died childless. Therefore, his younger brother, Charles, aged 66, inherited the throne of France. On 27 September Charles X made his state entry into Paris to popular acclaim. During the ceremony, while presenting the King the keys to the city, the comte de Chabrol, Prefect of the Seine, declared: \\"Proud to possess its new king, Paris can aspire to become the queen of cities by its magnificence, as its people aspire to be foremost in its fidelity, its devotion, and its love.\\"Mansel, Philip, Paris Between Empires (St. Martin's Press, New York 2001) p.198 Eight months later, the mood of the capital had sharply worsened in its opinion of the new king. The causes of this dramatic shift in public opinion were many, but the main two were: * The imposition of the death penalty for anyone profaning the Eucharist (see Anti-Sacrilege Act). * The provisions for financial indemnities for properties confiscated by the 1789 Revolution and the First Empire of Napoleon‚Äîthese indemnities to be paid to anyone, whether noble or non-noble, who had been declared \\"enemies of the revolution.\\" Critics of the first accused the king and his new ministry of pandering to the Catholic Church, and by so doing violating guarantees of equality of religious belief as specified in La Charte. The second matter, that of financial indemnities, was far more opportunistic than the first. This was because, since the restoration of the monarchy, there had been demands from all groups to settle matters of property ownership: to reduce, if not eliminate, the uncertainties in the real estate marketMansel, Philip, Paris Between Empires (St. Martin Press, New York 2001) p.200 both in Paris and in the rest of France. But opponents, many of whom were frustrated Bonapartists, began a whispering campaign that Charles X was only proposing this in order to shame those who had not emigrated. Both measures, they claimed, were nothing more than clever subterfuge meant to bring about the destruction of La Charte. Up to this time, thanks to the popularity of the constitution and the Chamber of Deputies with the people of Paris, the king's relationship with the √©lite‚Äîboth of the Bourbon supporters and Bourbon opposition‚Äîhad remained solid. This, too, was about to change. On 12 April, propelled by both genuine conviction and the spirit of independence, the Chamber of Deputies roundly rejected the government's proposal to change the inheritance laws. The popular newspaper Le Constitutionnel pronounced this refusal \\"a victory over the forces of counter-revolutionaries and reactionism.\\"Ledr√©, Charles La Presse √† l'assaut de la monarchie. (1960). p.70. The popularity of both the Chamber of Peers and the Chamber of Deputies skyrocketed, and the popularity of the king and his ministry dropped. This became unmistakable when on 16 April 1827, while reviewing the Garde Royale in the Champ de Mars, the king was greeted with icy silence, many of the spectators refusing even to remove their hats. Charles X \\"later told [his cousin] Orl√©ans that, 'although most people present were not too hostile, some looked at times with terrible expressions'.\\"Marie Am√©lie, 356; (17 April 1827); Antonetti, 527. Because of what it perceived to be growing, relentless, and increasingly vitriolic criticism of both the government and the Church, the government of Charles X introduced into the Chamber of Deputies a proposal for a law tightening censorship, especially in regard to the newspapers. The Chamber, for its part, objected so violently that the humiliated government had no choice but to withdraw its proposals. THE GREAT NUTCRACKER OF JULY 25th. In this caricature Charles X attempts to break a billiard ball marked \\"charter\\" with his teeth, but finds the nut too hard to crack. On 17 March 1830, the majority in the Chamber of Deputies passed a motion of no confidence, the Address of the 221, against the king and Polignac's ministry. The following day, Charles dissolved parliament, and then alarmed the Bourbon opposition by delaying elections for two months. During this time, the liberals championed the \\"221\\" as popular heroes, whilst the government struggled to gain support across the country as prefects were shuffled around the departments of France. The elections that followed returned an overwhelming majority, thus defeating the government. This came after another event: on the grounds that it had behaved in an offensive manner towards the crown, on 30 April the king abruptly dissolved the National Guard of Paris, a voluntary group of citizens and an ever reliable conduit between the monarchy and the people. Cooler heads were appalled: \\"[I] would rather have my head cut off\\", wrote a noble from the Rhineland upon hearing the news, \\"than have counseled such an act: the only further measure needed to cause a revolution is censorship.\\"Duc de Dolberg, Castellan, II, 176 (letter 30 April 1827) That came on Sunday, 25 July 1830 when he set about to alter the Charter of 1814 by decree. These decrees, known as the July Ordinances, dissolved the Chamber of Deputies, suspended the liberty of the press, excluded the commercial middle-class from future elections, and called for new elections. On Monday 26 July, they were published in the leading conservative newspaper in Paris, Le Moniteur. On Tuesday 27 July, the revolution began in earnest , and the end of the Bourbon monarchy.  The Three Glorious Days  = Monday, 26 July 1830 = Scenes of July 1830, a painting by L√©on Cogniet alluding to the July revolution of 1830 It was a hot, dry summer, pushing those who could afford it to leave Paris for the country. Most businessmen could not, and so were among the first to learn of the Saint-Cloud \\"Ordinances\\", which banned them from running as candidates for the Chamber of Deputies, membership of which was indispensable to those who sought the ultimate in social prestige. In protest, members of the Bourse refused to lend money, and business owners shuttered their factories. Workers were unceremoniously turned out into the street to fend for themselves. Unemployment, which had been growing through early summer, spiked. \\"Large numbers of... workers therefore had nothing to do but protest.\\"Mansel, Philip, Paris Between Empires (St. Martin Press, New York 2001) p. 238 While newspapers such as the Journal des d√©bats, Le Moniteur, and Le Constitutionnel had already ceased publication in compliance with the new law, nearly 50 journalists from a dozen city newspapers met in the offices of Le National. There they signed a collective protest, and vowed their newspapers would continue to run.Mansel, 2001, p.238 That evening, when police raided a news press and seized contraband newspapers, they were greeted by a sweltering, unemployed mob angrily shouting, \\"√Ä bas les Bourbons!\\" (\\"Down with the Bourbons!\\") and \\"Vive la Charte!\\" (\\"Long live the Charter!\\"). Armand Carrel, a journalist, wrote in the next day's edition of Le National: > France... falls back into revolution by the act of the government itself... > the legal regime is now interrupted, that of _force_ has begun... in the > situation in which we are now placed obedience has ceased to be a duty...

No event worthy of attention is recorded in the reports that have come through to me.\\"Pickney, David. The French Revolution of 1830 (Princeton 1972), p. 93. = Tuesday, 27 July 1830: Day One = Seizure of the presses of the Le National, a triggering event of the July Revolution. Paris, 27 July. Throughout the day, Paris grew quiet as the milling crowds grew larger. At 4:30 pm commanders of the troops of the First Military division of Paris and the Garde Royale were ordered to concentrate their troops, and guns, on the Place du Carrousel facing the Tuileries, the Place Vend√¥me, and the Place de la Bastille. In order to maintain order and protect gun shops from looters, military patrols throughout the city were established, strengthened, and expanded. However, no special measures were taken to protect either the arm depots or gunpowder factories. For a time, those precautions seemed premature, but at 7:00 pm, with the coming of twilight, the fighting began. \\"Parisians, rather than soldiers, were the aggressor. Paving stones, roof tiles, and flowerpots from the upper windows... began to rain down on the soldiers in the streets\\".Mansel, Philip, Paris Between Empires, (St. Martin Press, New York 2001) p.239. At first, soldiers fired warning shots into the air. But before the night was over, twenty-one civilians were killed. Rioters then paraded the corpse of one of their fallen throughout the streets shouting \\"Mort aux Ministres! √Ä bas les aristocrates!\\" (\\"Death to the ministers! Down with the aristocrats!\\") One witness wrote: > [I saw] a crowd of agitated people pass by and disappear, then a troop of > cavalry succeed them... In every direction and at intervals... Indistinct > noises, gunshots, and then for a time all is silent again so for a time one > could believe that everything in the city was normal.

In 1828, the city of Paris had installed some 2,000 street lamps. These lanterns were hung on ropes looped-on-looped from one pole to another, as opposed to being secured on posts. The rioting lasted well into the night until most of them had been destroyed by 10:00 PM, forcing the crowds to slip away. = Wednesday, 28 July 1830: Day Two = H√¥tel de Ville (revolutionaries went there in 1789, and later 1848 and 1870), by Am√©d√©e Bourgeois Fighting in Paris continued throughout the night. One eyewitness wrote: > It is hardly a quarter past eight, and already shouts and gun shots can be > heard. Business is at a complete standstill....

Cries > of \\"√Ä bas le roi !', '√Ä la guillotine!!\\" can be heard....Olivier, Juste, > Paris en 1830, Journal (28 July 1830) p. 247. Charles X ordered Mar√©chal Auguste Marmont, Duke of Ragusa, the on-duty Major- General of the Garde Royale, to repress the disturbances. Marmont was personally liberal, and opposed to the ministry's policy, but was bound tightly to the King because he believed such to be his duty; and possibly because of his unpopularity for his generally perceived and widely criticized desertion of Napoleon in 1814. The king remained at Saint-Cloud, but was kept abreast of the events in Paris by his ministers, who insisted that the troubles would end as soon as the rioters ran out of ammunition. Battle outside the H√¥tel de Ville, by Jean-Victor Schnetz Marmont's plan was to have the Garde Royale and available line units of the city garrison guard the vital thoroughfares and bridges of the city, as well as protect important buildings such as the Palais Royal, Palais de Justice, and the H√¥tel de Ville. This plan was both ill-considered and wildly ambitious; not only were there not enough troops, but there were also nowhere near enough provisions. The Garde Royale was mostly loyal for the moment, but the attached line units were wavering: a small but growing number of troops were deserting; some merely slipping away, others leaving, not caring who saw them. In Paris, a committee of the Bourbon opposition, composed of banker-and-kingmaker Jacques Laffitte, Casimir Perier, Generals √âtienne G√©rard and Georges Mouton, comte de Lobau, among others, had drawn up and signed a petition in which they asked for the ordonnances to be withdrawn. The petition was critical \\"not of the King, but his ministers\\", thereby countering the conviction of Charles X that his liberal opponents were enemies of his dynasty.Mansel, Philip, Paris Between Empires (St. Martin Press, New York 2001) p.245. After signing the petition, committee members went directly to Marmont to beg for an end to the bloodshed, and to plead with him to become a mediator between Saint-Cloud and Paris. Marmont acknowledged the petition, but stated that the people of Paris would have to lay down arms first for a settlement to be reached. Discouraged but not despairing, the party then sought out the king's chief minister, de Polignac ‚Äì \\"Jeanne d'Arc en culottes\\". From Polignac they received even less satisfaction. He refused to see them, perhaps because he knew that discussions would be a waste of time. Like Marmont, he knew that Charles X considered the ordonnances vital to the safety and dignity of the throne of France. Thus, the King would not withdraw the ordonnances. At 4 pm, Charles X received Colonel Komierowski, one of Marmont's chief aides. The colonel was carrying a note from Marmont to his Majesty: > Sire, it is no longer a riot, it is a revolution. It is urgent for Your > Majesty to take measures for pacification. The honour of the crown can still > be saved. Tomorrow, perhaps, there will be no more time... I await with > impatience Your Majesty's orders.Mansel, Philip, Paris Between Empires (St. > Martin Press, New York 2001) p.247. The king asked Polignac for advice, and the advice was to resist. = Thursday, 29 July 1830: Day Three = Battle at the Rue de Rohan, by Hippolyte Lecomte > \\"They (the king and ministers) do not come to Paris\\", wrote the poet, > novelist and playwright Alfred de Vigny, \\"people are dying for them ... Not > one prince has appeared. The poor men of the guard abandoned without orders, > without bread for two days, hunted everywhere and fighting.\\"de Vigny, > Alfred, Journal d'un po√®te, 33, (29 July 1830). Perhaps for the same reason, royalists were nowhere to be found; perhaps another reason was that now the r√©volt√©s were well organized and very well armed. In only a day and a night, over 4,000 barricades had been thrown up throughout the city. The tricolor flag of the revolutionaries ‚Äì the \\"people's flag\\" ‚Äì flew over buildings, an increasing number of them important buildings. The arrival of the duc d'Orl√©ans (Louis Phillipe) at the Palais-Royal, by Jean-Baptiste Carbillet Marmont lacked either the initiative or the presence of mind to call for additional troops from Saint-Denis, Vincennes, Lun√©ville, or Saint-Omer; neither did he ask for help from reservists or those Parisians still loyal to Charles X. The Bourbon opposition and supporters of the July Revolution swarmed to his headquarters demanding the arrest of Polignac and the other ministers, while supporters of the Bourbon and city leaders demanded he arrest the rioters and their puppet masters. Marmont refused to act on either request, instead awaiting orders from the king. By 1:30 pm, the Tuileries Palace had been sacked. \\"A man wearing a ball dress belonging to the duchesse de Berry, with feathers and flowers in his hair, screamed from a palace window: 'Je re√ßois! Je re√ßois!' ('I receive! I receive!') Others drank wine from the palace cellars.\\"M√©moires d'outre-tombe, III, 120; Fontaine II, 849 (letter of 9 August 1830). Earlier that day, the Louvre had fallen, even more quickly. The Swiss Guards, seeing the mob swarming towards them, and manacled by the orders of Marmont not to fire unless fired upon first, ran away. They had no wish to share the fate of a similar contingent of Swiss Guards back in 1792, who had held their ground against another such mob and were torn to pieces. By mid-afternoon, the greatest prize, the H√¥tel de Ville, had been captured. The amount of looting during these three days was surprisingly small; not only at the Louvre‚Äîwhose paintings and objets d'art were protected by the crowd‚Äîbut the Tuileries, the Palais de Justice, the Archbishop's Palace, and other places as well. A few hours later, politicians entered the battered complex and set about establishing a provisional government. Though there would be spots of fighting throughout the city for the next few days, the revolution, for all intents and purposes, was over.  Result  Louis-Phillipe going from the Palais Royal to the H√¥tel de Ville, 31 July 1830, by Horace Vernet The revolution of July 1830 created a constitutional monarchy. On 2 August, Charles X and his son the Dauphin abdicated their rights to the throne and departed for Great Britain. Although Charles had intended that his grandson, the Duke of Bordeaux, would take the throne as Henry V, the politicians who composed the provisional government instead placed on the throne a distant cousin, Louis Philippe of the House of Orl√©ans, who agreed to rule as a constitutional monarch. This period became known as the July Monarchy. Supporters of the exiled senior line of the Bourbon dynasty became known as Legitimists. The July Column, located on Place de la Bastille, commemorates the events of the Three Glorious Days. This renewed French Revolution sparked an August uprising in Brussels and the Southern Provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, leading to separation and the establishment of the Kingdom of Belgium. The example of the July Revolution also inspired unsuccessful revolutions in Italy and the November Uprising in Poland. Two years later, Parisian republicans, disillusioned by the outcome and underlying motives of the uprising, revolted in an event known as the June Rebellion. Although the insurrection was crushed within less than a week, the July Monarchy remained doubtfully popular, disliked for different reasons by both Right and Left, and was eventually overthrown in 1848.

She was the fourth and final vessel to be completed in the four-vessel page 115 and was named after Mount Akagi in Gunma Prefecture. Background Akagi was the last in a series of 600-ton gunboats, which included the , , and , built from 1885‚Äì1886 under the supervisor of the French naval architect, Bellard. She was the only vessel in the class to be equipped with a steel-hull instead of an iron or composite hull.Chesneau, All the World‚Äôs Fighting Ships, p. 236. Construction Akagi was designed with a horizontal double expansion reciprocating steam engine with two cylindrical boilers driving two screws. She also had two masts for a schooner sail rig. Initially, she was armed with one Krupp L/22 breech-loading gun, one Krupp L/22 breech-loading gun and two quadruple 1-inch Nordenfelt guns, and was intended primarily for port defense. However, by early 1894, she had been rebuilt with a high short forecastle and four 120-millimeter guns arranged on her centerline, six 47-mm rapid-fire guns (two by the bridge, facing forward, and two mounted in small sponsons on either side of the hull). All guns were protected by gun shields. Well-armed for her size, she was soon rendered obsolete with the introduction of larger protected cruisers into the Imperial Japanese Navy inventory. Service record Ukiyo-e depicting Akagi in the Battle of the Yalu River in the First Sino-Japanese War, titled \\"Lieutenant- Commander Sakamoto of the Imperial Warship Akagi, Fights Bravely\\" IJN Gunboat Oshima Akagi was laid down at the Onohama Shipyards on 20 July 1886 and launched on 7 August 1888. She was completed on 20 August 1890.Nishida, Ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy Akagi saw combat service in the First Sino- Japanese War, initially patrolling between Korea, Dairen and Weihaiwei. She was included in the Japanese squadron at the Battle of the Yalu River by Japanese Admiral It≈ç Sukeyuki, as he needed a ship with shallow draft to explore the shallows of Korea Bay. When the Japanese fleet closed with the Chinese Beiyang Fleet on 17 September 1894, Akagi was ordered protect the Japanese command ship, the converted passenger liner Saiky≈ç Maru carrying Admiral Kabeyama Sukenori, towards the rear of the Japanese lines. However, Akagi came under attack by the much larger and faster Chinese cruiser at 13:20 hours. When Laiyuan closed to , Akagi opened fire, causing considerable damage and setting Laiyuan on fire. However, Laiyuan‚Äôs first salvo struck Akagi on the bridge, killing her captain, Sakamoto Hachirota. Command of the vessel was transferred to her navigator, Lieutenant Sat≈ç Tetsutar≈ç, but Akagi continued to be pounded by the Chinese ship, with damage to her lower deck housing, and severing a steam line. Hot steam cut off access to her magazine, and shells had to be hand-fed through a broken vent to reach her guns. Akagi attempted to escape, but was raked from the stern by a full broadside by Laiyuan, whereas she could counter with only one of her 120-mm guns. When Laiyuan has closed to , she again scored a hit on Akagi‚Äôs bridge, incapacitating her provisional captain. Command was then transferred to a junior lieutenant, and Akagi continued to return fire with her stern guns. However, by 14:20, the fire on Laiyuan has spread to the extent that future offensive maneuvering was impossible, and she broke off pursuit. Akagi drifted out of control for the remainder of the battle, as her crew battled to fix damage. After the battle ended, she was able to return to the Japanese squadron under her own power. During this brief encounter, 11 men were killed and 17 wounded out of her crew of 111 men; however, she was credited with having taken a major enemy ship out of action. On 21 March 1898, Akagi was re-designated as a second-class gunboat., and was used for coastal survey and patrol duties. During the Boxer Rebellion, Akagi was assigned to patrol off the Taku Forts. During the Russo- Japanese War, Akagi assisted in the Siege of Port Arthur. On 2 May 1904, she assisted in the attempted blockade of the channel leading into the port. She was later sent to the western coast of Kwantung Peninsula to provide fire support during the Battle of Nanshan. While on patrol outside Port Arthur on 18 May 1904 she collided with the gunboat , which subsequently sank. Akagi later participated in the Invasion of Sakhalin. Akagi was removed the navy list on 1 April 1911, and after being demilitarized, was sold as a transport in March 1912 to the Kawasaki Kisen Corporation as Akagi Maru. She was again sold in 1921 to the Amagasaki Steamship Lines, and sank in 1945 during a typhoon. She was raised, and placed into service again, only to be sunk by a naval mine in the Seto Inland Sea off of Okayama Prefecture in January 1946. Raised once more and repaired, she was placed back into service, until she was finally scrapped at Osaka in 1953. Notes References * Corbett, Sir Julian.

Bown and ozone.Atmospheric Chemistry, Ann M. Holloway,Richard Peer Wayne  Life  Sch√∂nbein (Schoenbein) related to Michael Schoenbein was born at Metzingen in the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg. Around the age of 13 he was apprenticed to a chemical and pharmaceutical firm at B√∂blingen. Through his own efforts, he acquired sufficient scientific skills and knowledge to ask for, and receive, an examination by the professor of chemistry at T√ºbingen. Sch√∂nbein passed the exam and, after a series of moves and university studies, eventually acquired a position at the University of Basel in 1828, becoming a full professor in 1835. He remained there until his death in 1868, and was buried in Basel.  Fuel cell  In 1839, Sch√∂nbein published the principle of the fuel cell in the \\"Philosophical Magazine\\".  Ozone  It was while doing experiments on the electrolysis of water at the University of Basel that Sch√∂nbein first began to notice a distinctive odor in his laboratory. This smell gave Sch√∂nbein the clue to the presence of a new product from his experiments. Because of the pronounced smell, Sch√∂nbein coined the term \\"ozone\\" for the new gas, from the Greek word \\"ozein\\", meaning \\"to smell\\". Sch√∂nbein described his discoveries in publications in 1840. He later found that the smell of ozone was similar to that produced by the slow oxidation of white phosphorus.See, for example, The ozone smell Sch√∂nbein detected is the same as that occurring in the vicinity of lightning storms, an odor that indicates the presence of ozone in the atmosphere.  Explosives  Although his wife had forbidden him to do so, Sch√∂nbein occasionally experimented at home in the kitchen. One day in 1845, when his wife was away, he spilled a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid. After using his wife's cotton apron to mop it up, he hung the apron over the stove to dry, only to find that the cloth spontaneously ignited and burned so quickly that it seemed to disappear. Sch√∂nbein, in fact, had converted the cellulose of the apron, with the nitro groups (added from the nitric acid) serving as an internal source of oxygen; when heated, the cellulose was completely and suddenly oxidized. Sch√∂nbein recognized the possibilities of the new compound. Ordinary black gunpowder, which had reigned supreme in the battlefield for the past 500 years, exploded into thick smoke, blackening the gunners, fouling cannons and small arms, and obscuring the battlefield. Nitrocellulose was perceived as a possible \\"smokeless powder\\" and a propellant for artillery shells thus it received the name of guncotton. Attempts to manufacture guncotton for military use failed at first because the factories were prone to explode and, above all else, the burning speed of straight guncotton was always too high. It was not until 1884 that Paul Vieille tamed guncotton into a successful progressive smokeless gunpowder called Poudre B. Later on, in 1891, James Dewar and Frederick Augustus Abel also managed to transform gelatinized guncotton into a safe mixture, called cordite because it could be extruded into long thin cords before being dried.

The distinction between ordinary and special LPEs is primarily relevant under the Constitution of Japan, which grants ordinary LPEs particular rights, including: * Direct elections (Article 93.2) * The right to legislate (Article 94) * Citizen referendum prior to enactment of any statute which specifically affects the LPE (Article 95) Special LPEs do not have these authorities except as otherwise provided by statute. While special wards are regarded as basic local governments within Tokyo, other special LPEs are consortia of LPEs for specific fields such as schools, waterworks and waste management. LPEs are self-governing in many respects, but report indirectly to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Tokyo, which monitors relations between LPEs, as well as relations between LPEs and the government. The Ministry generally approves all inter-prefectural special LPEs, while inter-municipal special LPEs are approved by prefectural governors. Revision In January 2011, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced plans to revise the law to enable the national government to investigate the laws of the LPEs for extralegality and place lawsuits against them if they fail to correct their actions.

Bing developed a flourishing import-export business from the 1870s onward, working through several commercial entities with various partners and family members; he concentrated on the importation and sale of Japanese and other Asian objets d'art, though his business also exported French goods to Japan, working through a Yokohama office managed by his younger brother August. In December 1895 he opened his famous gallery, the Maison de l'Art Nouveau, which showed works of artists of what would become known as the Art Nouveau style. Henry van de Velde designed the interior of the gallery, while Louis Comfort Tiffany supplied stained glass. Bing's gallery featured entire rooms designed in the Art Nouveau style by his in- house designers. During the gallery's most successful period, 1896-1902, Bing sold a great variety of artistic work, included fabrics designed by William Morris, glassware by Louis Comfort Tiffany, jewelry, paintings, ceramics, stained glass, and furniture of Art Nouveau style. Bing dealt with customers ranging from private collectors to major museums, and helped to promote a global art market. His pavilion at the 1900 Paris World's Fair was especially notable. By this time Bing was the primary European dealer for the Rookwood Pottery Co. of Cincinnati and the Grueby Faience Company of Boston, as well as the wares of Tiffany. Siegfried Bing had also a significant role in promoting artists who were associated in the new style movement named Les Nabis, including Pierre Bonnard, √âdouard Vuillard, Maurice Denis, Paul S√©rusier, Paul Ranson and Felix Vallotton. Les Nabis et le d√©cor. Mus√©e du Luxembourg, Paris. https://en.museeduluxembourg.fr/les-nabis-et-le-decor Influence Bing advanced the careers of a wide range of artists, including Louis Bonnier, Frank Brangwyn, and √âdouard Vuillard, the designers Eug√®ne Gaillard, Edward Colonna, William Benson, and Georges de Feure, and the sculptor Constantin Meunier. Bing closed his gallery during 1904, a year before his death, when the fashion for Art Nouveau was already beginning to wane. Bing's activities were important, perhaps crucial, to the Japanese influence on Art Nouveau. He published a monthly journal, Le Japon Artistique, which began in 1888 and was collected in three volumes in 1891. The journal influenced people like Gustav Klimt.

He lived with a few other roommates when Chandler moved out to move in with Monica. Joey was presumably born in 1968 as he talks about being 13 in 1981. He is from Queens, New York and is Catholic. Joey comes from a working-class Italian-American family of eight children, of which he is the only boy. His father Joseph Tribbiani, Sr. (Robert Costanzo), is a pipefitter, and his mother's name is Gloria (Brenda Vaccaro). Joey has seven sisters: Mary Therese (Mimi Lieber on Friends) a.k.a. Mary Teresa (Christina Ricci on Joey), Mary Angela (Holly Gagnier), Dina (Marla Sokoloff), Gina (K.J. Steinberg on Friends, Drea de Matteo on Joey), Tina (Lisa Maris), Veronica (Dena Miceli), and Cookie (Alex Meneses). As a child, he was extremely accident-prone. In \\"The One with Ross' New Girlfriend\\", it was implied that he was sexually abused by his tailor but didn't realize it until Chandler went to the same tailor. Joey is portrayed as promiscuous and dim-witted but good-natured, as well as very loyal, caring, and protective of his friends. He is a food-loving womanizer who has had more luck with dates than any of the other group members. In contrast to his persona as the \\"ladies‚Äô man\\", he has also a marked childish side. He enjoys playing video games and foosball, loves sandwiches and pizza, and is a big fan of Baywatch. As a struggling actor, he is constantly looking for work. He was ordained as a minister in \\"The One with the Truth About London\\" and officiated at both Monica and Chandler's and Phoebe and Mike's weddings. He does not like sharing food and has difficulty with simple mathematics. In sports, Joey likes the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees in baseball, Los Angeles Clippers and New York Knicks in basketball, New York Giants and New York Jets in football, and the Detroit Red Wings and New York Rangers in hockey. Appearances Joey Tribbiani is a member of the Screen Actors Guild, having refused to follow in his father's footsteps and become a pipefitter. He started his acting profession doing stage work, introduced in the show's pilot episode by Monica and Chandler having seen Joey in a production of Pinocchio. Sometime prior to the start of the series, Joey also had appeared in a porn film, as a fully clothed extra. Joey also mentioned appearing in a play with trolls before getting the leading role of Sigmund Freud in the musical play Freud! where he was first spotted by his talent agent Estelle Leonard. She immediately got him a film role in the same episode as Al Pacino's \\"butt double\\" ‚Äì a speechless role he later lost due to taking the part too seriously. Monica and Chandler also once discussed having seen Joey in a version of Macbeth, in which he was unable to pronounce most of the words. Joey becomes an \\"actor-slash-model\\" when he appears on print ads for the NYC Free Clinic, as a man named \\"Mario\\" who has a venereal disease. He also did an infomercial for a device that lets you pour milk out of milk cartons; he played \\"Kevin\\", a man who had extreme difficulty opening the cartons without the use of the device. (\\"Kevin\\" also inadvertently choked on a cookie during the show.). This haunted him again when he appeared in the play 'The King', where he was made fun of due to choking on a cookie. In Season Two, Joey continued his stage work, appearing as \\"The King\\" in a poorly reviewed (and never-named) play. Published reviews of his performance claimed he was \\"disturbingly unskilled\\" and that he achieved \\"brilliant new levels of sucking\\" in a \\"mediocre play\\" with \\"mindless, adolescent direction\\". Only days after these reviews came out, Joey gets his big break when he lands his first major role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on the soap opera Days of Our Lives. He had initially gone in to read for a one-shot role as a cab driver; it is implied that he got the recurring role of Ramoray by sleeping with the casting director. While still playing Ramoray, he also appears in a bit role as a dead man in the film Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Several episodes later, Joey costs himself the Days of our Lives gig when during an interview with Soap Opera Digest, he radically overstates and claims he writes most of his own lines. This angers the show's writers, who out of spite, \\"kill off\\" his character by having Dr. Ramoray fall down an elevator shaft. Joey takes this very hard and admits that his role on Days was the best thing that ever happened to him. He goes back to stage acting in Season Three appearing in a play called Boxing Day opposite love interest Kate Miller. The play seems to start out as a conventional drama but ends with Joey's character \\"Victor\\" being taken from his apartment by aliens. In Season Four, he lands a small one-scene movie role as a cop, playing his scene opposite Charlton Heston. Joey had some bad luck in terms of his acting career. In Season Five, he is cast in the independent film Shutter Speed, but it is shut down before filming began in Las Vegas. He was also fired from a Burger King commercial. He filmed a role in a Law & Order episode that was cut from the completed episode‚ÄîJoey was only \\"seen\\" as a corpse in a body bag. In seasons 6 and 7, he lands a starring role as Detective 'Mac' Machiavelli in a very short-lived, and very bad cop show called Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E, which Chandler described as \\"one of the worst things ever... and not just on TV.\\" Joey had high hopes for the series, however Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E was canceled halfway through its first season. In Season 7, Joey auditions for the role of Dr. Striker Ramoray, a new character on \\"Days of Our Lives\\" and Drake Ramoray's brother, but he doesn't get that role. Eventually, Joey's luck turns when he gets back his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray and even nominated for an award for Best Returning Character, first as a character in coma, then revived through a brain transplant with another character, Jessica Lockhart (played by Susan Sarandon). In Season 7, he later replaces Lockhart as Dr. Drake \\"Jessica\\" Ramoray. Later, in the spin-off Joey, it turns out that he loses his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray and has to again hunt for a new job. Later in season 7, Joey lands a supporting role as \\"Tony\\", a soldier, in a major film opposite an Oscar-nominated actor named Richard Crosby (Gary Oldman). The film is a World War I period film entitled Over There. Joey is also briefly employed at Central Perk as a waiter. Facing a dry spell in his career as an actor, Joey is persuaded by Gunther, the manager, to take a job serving coffee. At first Joey tries to hide his new job from his friends, but they eventually figure it out. He does not like the work but, true to his nature, soon finds a way to use his position to meet and ingratiate himself to attractive women by giving them free food, although Gunther quickly puts a stop to it. Joey doesn't take his job very seriously and spends a lot of his working hours sitting and talking to his friends. Eventually he is fired for closing the coffeehouse in the middle of the day to go to an audition while Gunther was running a personal errand. Rachel later persuades Gunther to give Joey back his job, but once Joey finds more steady acting jobs he eventually just stops showing up. His absence is barely noticed. In a later episode, Joey realizes he forgot to tell Gunther he quit; Gunther replies that he would have eventually fired him anyway. Joey is also briefly a sperm donor for a medical experiment; at the end, the hospital would pay any donor $700. This was later mentioned when Monica goes to a sperm bank. Joey finds to his dismay that his sperm is not very popular. Some of Joey's other jobs have included selling Christmas trees, dressing as Santa Claus and as a Christmas elf, working as a tour guide at the Museum of Natural History where Ross worked, offering perfume samples to customers at a department store, and as a Roman warrior at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. He also works at the restaurant \\"Alessandro's\\" where Monica is head chef, nicknaming himself \\"Dragon\\" while on the job. Monica hires him just so she can fire him to intimidate the other employees who pay her no respect, but he makes a lot of tips and backs out of the deal, only to realize how important his getting fired was to Monica. He then sets himself up to be fired the next day. He spends one episode working with Chandler as an entry-level data processor. He treats the job like another acting role, in which he is \\"Joseph the Processing Guy\\" and creates a complex back-story for the character. Chandler begins to dislike the Joseph character when he starts showing up Chandler at work. Joey eventually leaves after Chandler pretends to sleep with Joey's \\"pretend wife\\". Prior to Monica and Chandler's wedding, when the two admit that they were having trouble finding someone to perform the ceremony, Joey volunteers for the role, subsequently getting himself ordained over the Internet to entitle him to perform the marriage. He has apparently retained this role until Season Ten, when he performed the ceremony for Phoebe's wedding. Joey is characterized as a simple-minded but good-natured womanizer who loves food. He particularly loves meatball sub sandwiches. When asked if he would give up sex or food he had trouble deciding and kept blurting out sex or food, eventually yelling \\"I want girls on bread!\\". In \\"The One with the Ride Along\\", he appears to be saving Ross from a putative gunshot, when it was actually his meatball sandwich that he was trying to save; it just happened to be next to Ross. He also loves the \\"Joey Special\\" ‚Äì two pizzas. His greed when it comes to food is also shown in the episode \\"The One With the Birth Mother\\" where he refuses to call Sarah the next day. When Phoebe asks why, Joey explains how Sarah broke his golden commandment on their date ‚Äì not to share food. Phoebe's shocked to say the least, but Rachel admits to her how this is who Joey is. Nonetheless, Phoebe makes Joey go out with Sarah again, making him order extra fries should the need arise. Joey does so, but Sarah really wants to dig in his seafood platter, making him drop his plate to the floor in the process. He exclaims, \\"Joey doesn't share food\\", which she seems to understand. However, things change course when Joey wants to nibble at her chocolate torte. As he wouldn't share his food with her, she reciprocates and warns him not to touch any of her desserts while she wanders off to take a call. When she arrives, her dessert is pretty much gone; Joey, with chocolate torte all over his face, is at peace with himself, and admits that he's \\"not even sorry!\\". In \\"The One With The Cheap Wedding Dress,\\" Ross implies that Joey eats a date's food without her permission regularly. Joey is something of an idiot savant in general, but capable of good ideas when the situation arises; this is alluded to in the episode \\"The One Where Ross Dates a Student\\", when Chandler, referring to Joey, says \\"A hot girl's at stake and suddenly he's Rain Man\\" when Joey suggested Ross work out who among his students called him the 'hottie of the paleontology department' by comparing the handwriting of the note to the handwriting in the class essays. In another example, Joey made up an anecdote referred to as the \\"Europe story\\" or the \\"magic story\\"; apparently, anyone who hears it will immediately want to have sex with the teller. This is proven to be effective when Rachel successfully uses the story on Ross. Being a glutton when it comes to food, Joey is shown throughout the series to have the uncanny ability to eat enormous quantities of food. As he prides the Tribbiani family for their eating prowess (\\"We might not be [...] world leaders, but damn it, we can eat!\\"), he takes on Monica's challenge to eat a whole roast turkey virtually all by himself. In season 8, episode 9, Monica is unwilling to cook a whole roast turkey for Thanksgiving dinner as Rachel is pregnant, Chandler refuses to eat Thanksgiving food due to childhood traumas, Phoebe is a vegetarian, and dinner guest Will (played by Brad Pitt) is on a diet. Joey's love for Thanksgiving traditions, however, convinces Monica to roast the turkey only under the condition that Joey can eat the entire 19-pound bird in one sitting. When Monica sees him struggle, she says she is only kidding, but Joey perseveres and with a little help of Phoebe's maternity pants, he eventually not only consumes the entire turkey, but has room for dessert afterwards. A similar eating stunt happens in season 9, episode 5, when Joey is left alone at the dinner table in a restaurant after Phoebe's failed birthday dinner, and he is forced to eat six meals by himself. He finishes them, only to tuck into the birthday cake afterwards. Joey is extremely promiscuous, often relying on his catchphrase pickup line \\"How you doin'?\\". He regularly sleeps with attractive women, but can never seem to get into a committed relationship ‚Äì judging from a conversation he had with Chandler at the latter's bachelor party he seems to regard marriage as depressing and restrictive. He sleeps with many of the interns and extras on shows on which he works. He has apparently been sexually active for a very long time; he undid a 16-year-old girl's bra when he was nine, slept with his teacher in the seventh grade, and had a \\"wild spring break\\" when he was 13. In the episode \\"The One With Joey's Interview\\", he sleeps with the interviewer (played by Sasha Alexander) so what he said about not watching soap operas doesn't get published in Soap Opera Digest. Despite his promiscuous nature towards many women throughout the series, he is highly protective and old- fashioned when it comes to the relationships of his own sisters. While he does not seem to have a problem with his own lifestyle, he repeatedly makes sure his sisters don't go down the same path. When he finds out in season 3, episode 11 that Chandler drunkenly made out with his sister Mary Angela, he attempts to force the two into a relationship. Later, in season 8, episode 10, Joey initially attempts to force his younger sister Dina into marriage with her hapless boyfriend upon hearing she's pregnant, but they play into his emotional nature by saying they want to raise the baby independently. While he is not very bright, Joey is a caring and kindhearted person. He lets Rachel live with him when she is fighting with Ross, financially supports Monica and Chandler, and helps Phoebe find work when she is unemployed. He is willing to marry Phoebe and Rachel on the separate occasions he finds out that each is pregnant. Joey is also the most physically powerful of the group, being able to easily push Ross over a couch with only one hand, and offering to go to the coffee house to intimidate two bullies into leaving Ross and Chandler alone. He is a Stephen King fan, having read The Shining several times, as well as being a fan of the film adaptation of one of King's novels, Cujo. He also becomes a fan of the classic novel, Little Women after Rachel asks him to read it to see if it was better than The Shining. Joey briefly mentions to the gang that Al Pacino is his idol. Joey has the poster for the 1983 Al Pacino film Scarface in his bedroom and the same poster is seen in his house in Joey. Joey, Ross and Chandler are huge fans of Die Hard. He moved apartment(s) four times in the series. The first time, he moved to his own lavish apartment away from Chandler (with whom the psychotic Eddie moved in) after he got the role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on Days of Our Lives, though he moved back soon afterward due to his loss of the role. The other times are when he and Chandler move into what is usually Monica's apartment, after winning it from her in a game in \\"The One with the Embryos\\". They are later forced back to their own apartment by the girls. Although Joey dates several women in the series, very few of these relationships are serious, his romantic partners rarely appearing for more than one episode. However, despite his great interest in women, Joey has made it clear more than once that his friends are more important to him; when his latest relationship, Janine (Elle Macpherson), stated that she dislikes Monica and Chandler, Joey breaks it off with her despite the fact that he had been trying to win her over for the previous four episodes. He tells Janine that Monica and Chandler are like family, and he can't be with her if she doesn't like them. Joey was originally shunned by Chandler when he came in for a roommate interview (in favour of a fashion photographer, who apologetically informs Chandler that, due to his work, models will have to come to the apartment, and that his sister - a porn actress - has a beach house Chandler is welcome to use), and Joey thought Chandler was gay. However, Mr. Heckles, another building resident, lied to Chandler's originally selected roommate, causing Chandler to have to go with his second choice roommate Joey (In \\"The One with the Flashback\\" set in 1993, Joey moved in 3 years before although in \\"The One with All the Thanksgivings\\" it shows that the gang knew Joey was Chandler's roommate in 1992 and he would have been his roommate for quite some time). Joey's first couple of days involved a brief, mutual attraction to Monica. This subsided and Chandler and Joey quickly became best friends as Joey's carefree lifestyle grew on Chandler. Later in the series, they bought a chick and a duck together, whom Chandler had named Yasmine and Dick, respectively. A long-running gag depicted Joey and Chandler occasionally fighting with each other like an old married couple. Joey moved out temporarily when he found success playing Dr. Drake Ramoray on a soap opera, but soon moved back in after his character was dropped down an elevator shaft. At the end of the series, Chandler and Monica made it clear to Joey that their new house outside the city would have a room for him. While Joey is best friends with Chandler, Ross is a close second (although Ross has been referred to as his best friend several times). At a time when Joey and Chandler had problems, when Chandler had kissed Joey's girlfriend, Joey stopped acting as Chandler's best friend and replaced him with Ross, although this only lasted until Chandler spent Thanksgiving in a box in order to show his remorse and apologize to him. Joey and Chandler have remained best friends ever since. Furthermore, Joey and Ross share a moment in an episode after watching Die Hard all night. They fall asleep on Ross' couch, which is evidently enjoyed by Joey, as he tries to coerce Ross into more nap sessions with him. Also, earlier in the series, after much persuading by Joey, Ross gives in and kisses him to help him practice kissing men. In response, Joey replies that the audition was already over, he had not gotten the part, but the kiss was very well received. Relationships The major development of their relationship outside the realm of normal male interaction was when Joey fell in love with Rachel, Ross's ex-girlfriend and the object of Ross's affections since ninth grade. When Joey goes on to tell Ross about it, he cannot say it in his face and instead says that he loves his \\"friend's\\" ex-girlfriend. When asked if that \\"friend\\" (Ross) is a good guy, Joey honestly answers \\"Yeah... He's the best\\". Initially, it causes a major rift, with Joey being apologetic, but when Ross sees Joey truly in love with Rachel, he gives him the go-ahead. Ross basically says that he is not okay with it but he wants to be, and the two's friendship deepens due to Joey's refusal to date Rachel unless Ross okays the deal. However, Joey and Rachel do not date long, and later, Joey encourages Ross to pursue Rachel in the season finale. Joey and Monica are close friends often joking around with each other. Joey allowed Monica to hire and fire him to prove to her employees that she was not a push-over. When he discovered that Monica and Chandler had developed a romantic relationship, he agreed to keep it secret until the two were ready to reveal it to the rest of their group. In an episode where he sees how close Chandler and Monica are, he dreams of himself and Monica in the same way. This later causes him to act weird around Monica. Finally, he reveals this to Chandler and Monica, it is that he wants a relationship like that, but Monica finds it nice thinking Joey thought of them two together. He also called Chandler moments after suspecting Monica of having an affair with a mystery male he had heard in her apartment. When Monica and Chandler needed their Engagement Picture taken, Chandler could not smile. In the newspaper announcement, it showed the photo was of Monica and Joey. Joey always enjoyed a close relationship with Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe; LeBlanc once speculated that Joey saw the girls as sisters more than potential romantic interests. However, the tension between Monica and Joey is at times fairly obvious, and it is made clear that the two have a very close, almost intimate, relationship, though it is never consummated on the show. According to DVD commentary of the pilot episode, Joey and Monica were initially meant to be the principal love connection of the show but was overshadowed by the Ross-Rachel relationship. In Episode 1.07 \\"The One with the Blackout\\", Phoebe blurted to Joey that Monica has a crush on him when he was moving in with Chandler. This idea was revisited in Season 7 when it is revealed that Monica initially meant to hit on Joey in London, and not Chandler. She states that it was because she was looking for something meaningless, never expecting to have found Chandler and fall in love with him. The concept of what their marriage would have been like was then envisioned by Phoebe and it consisted of Monica cooking all the time for a very fat Joey. Phoebe is Joey's female best friend. They appear to understand each other. They are the only members of the group who lack a college education. Joey is Phoebe's best male friend; they have dinner together once a month to talk about the rest of the group and Joey once tried to get Phoebe to call him 'Big Daddy' in that same episode. Both characters show a softness for each other, even when joking or when they are upset with the others. In \\"The One with the Race Car Bed\\", it is implied that Phoebe can hear Joey's thoughts. In \\"The One With the Ride Along\\", she explains that \\"when the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all... not you, Joey\\". In the episode \\"The One in Vegas\\", after Joey has said that no-one will live in his hand-shaped mansion, he adds \\"Except you, Pheebs... you can live in the thumb\\". When she was a surrogate mother for her brother's triplets and suddenly craved meat, Joey offered to eat no meat until the babies were born, to compensate for her consumption and, in a way, preserve her vegetarianism (no extra animals would have to be killed). In The One With All the Cheesecakes, it is shown that the two tried to meet once a month for dinner in order to discuss the other Friends. When Phoebe was upset because she'd turned thirty-one without having had the perfect kiss, Joey kissed her so that she could cross that off her list (also adding that he was one-sixteenth Portuguese when she mentioned that she hadn't met any Portuguese people). Joey did not have romantic feelings for Phoebe. Joey dates briefly Phoebe's twin sister Ursula, which upsets Phoebe; he breaks it off to preserve his friendship with Phoebe, however. When Monica finds out that Joey \\"sees a friend in a different way\\", she assumes it to be Phoebe. Phoebe, overwhelmed by the news, approaches Joey, only to find that it is Rachel. Phoebe also has Joey locked in as a backup for her marriage. When the Friends believe that the group may have to split up, Phoebe and Rachel conspire to form a separate group by themselves, but Phoebe insists that Joey be invited to their new group as well. Phoebe's loyalty is proved again when she states that she could live in Las Vegas, since it has everything she needs, \\"Including Joey!\\". He, in turn, invites her to live with him in the mansion he expected to own when he becomes rich from having a hand-twin. When Joey learned from a customer at Central Perk that Phoebe was apparently a porn star, he refused to watch the movies even when the other four decided to do so. However, he shows a new interest in them when he learned that the film actually stars Ursula. When Joey believes Phoebe to be pregnant, he proposes, claiming the world is too scary for a single mother. This proposal is apparently made entirely without romantic intentions. Phoebe says yes and accepts his ring, but Monica tells Joey that it is Rachel who is pregnant, so Joey proposes to Rachel and must retrieve the ring from a reluctant Phoebe. Phoebe also sets up Joey with many of her friends. On a double date, Joey sets her up with a stranger, Mike (Paul Rudd), whom she eventually marries. In one episode, after persuasion from Rachel, he reads Little Women and she reads The Shining. She finds out that whenever he gets scared whilst reading he puts the book in the freezer. At the end of the episode, Joey is afraid that one of the characters is going to die and Rachel says 'Do you want to put it in the freezer?' Their close friendship continues and when a fire destroys Rachel and Phoebe's apartment, Rachel moves in with Joey and stays there, even after her apartment has been repaired. Halfway through season 8, Joey and Rachel go out on a date, so that Rachel can have one night of fun before it becomes too obvious that she's pregnant. They have a great time, and afterwards, Joey starts developing feelings for Rachel. He does not act on his feelings out of loyalty to Ross. However, upon discovering Joey's feelings for Rachel, Ross encourages his friend to talk to her. Joey tells Rachel about his feelings, but she does not return them, and things are awkward between them for a while, but they quickly reconcile. In late season 9, Rachel starts developing feelings for Joey, but fears he does not feel the same way anymore and has already moved on, especially when he starts dating Ross' colleague Charlie Wheeler (Aisha Tyler). When the gang goes to Barbados for a convention from Ross' work, Joey finds out about Rachel's feelings, and even though he first says nothing can happen, he changes his mind when he sees Charlie and Ross kiss, and he goes back to Rachel's room to be with her. They continue their relationship for several episodes and gain Ross' approval after he realizes that it has been six years since his relationship with Rachel ended, and he should move on from that. When Rachel and Joey prepare for their first night together, however, they realize that they are too close as friends to make their relationship work, with Rachel instinctively slapping Joey away when he tries to touch her as she suddenly finds herself unable to get past the fact that it's Joey touching her. After Chandler mentions how natural it was for him and Monica to make the transition from friends to lovers, Joey and Rachel realize they are not on the same path and go back to being friends. At the end, when Chandler and Monica announce that they are moving into a house, Joey presents them with a housewarming gift of a chick and a duck, who are named Chick Jr. and Duck Jr. The pets remain in Joey's apartment but were presumably given away to a shelter when Joey moved to LA. Soon after Chandler and Monica move out, Joey moves to LA to focus on his acting career. That was the last time the six best friends are portrayed hanging out together. Joey After the final season of Friends, Joey becomes the main character of Joey, a spin- off/sequel series, where he moves to L.A. to polish his acting career. His sister Gina Tribbiani (Drea de Matteo) and his nephew Michael (Paulo Costanzo) are two other central characters in the show. Joey turns down a role in a sitcom called Nurses to star in a different series pilot. His pilot does not get picked up, while Nurses becomes a huge hit. However, his acting career has had some better moments. In Joey, it is revealed that Joey's character of Dr. Drake Ramoray dies again on Days of Our Lives where he is stabbed by a nurse (\\"Joey and the Wrong Name\\"). He wins a Daytime Soap Award for \\"Best Death Scene\\". In later Joey episodes, Joey lands a starring role on the prime time soap Deep Powder. When he gets fired from that job, he bounces back by snagging a leading role in the big-budget action picture Captured. Throughout the series, Joey develops a complicated on-off relationship with Alex Garrett (Andrea Anders), his next-door neighbor and property manager. They become good friends upon meeting and Alex confides her problems with her marriage in Joey. At the end of season one, she and Joey become romantically involved during her separation from her husband. In season two she becomes romantically interested in Joey and has a crush on him for a long period. Gina tries to help her to get over Joey, but once Alex starts dating Joey's friend Dean, Joey soon realizes that he is also in love with Alex, and they slowly form a committed relationship. In the series finale, Joey becomes concerned over believing that Alex is planning for marriage too early in their relationship, only to become upset when she says she does not want to marry again. When the two argue about the situation, Alex compares his attitude to him not wanting a piece of broccoli until the second she denies it from him. This argument culminates in them nearly marrying out of spite until they make up when he admits to her that she is the first girl he has ever wanted to marry. At the end of the episode, Alex gives Joey back the piece of broccoli, implying that she may be changing her mind about marrying again.

Simon wrote many books and articles, mostly on economic subjects. He is best known for his work on population, natural resources, and immigration. His work covers cornucopian views on lasting economic benefits from natural resources and continuous population growth, even despite limited or finite physical resources, empowered by human ingenuity, substitutes, and technological progress. He is also known for the famous Simon‚ÄìEhrlich wager, a bet he made with ecologist Paul R. Ehrlich. Ehrlich bet that the prices for five metals would increase over a decade, while Simon took the opposite stance. Simon won the bet, as the prices for the metals sharply declined during that decade. Theory Simon's 1981 book The Ultimate Resource is a criticism of what was then the conventional wisdom on resource scarcity, published within the context of the cultural background created by the best-selling and highly influential book The Population Bomb in 1968 by Paul R. Ehrlich and The Limits to Growth analysis published in 1972. The Ultimate Resource challenged the conventional wisdom on population growth, raw-material scarcity and resource consumption. Simon argues that our notions of increasing resource-scarcity ignore the long-term declines in wage-adjusted raw material prices. Viewed economically, he argues, increasing wealth and technology make more resources available; although supplies may be limited physically they may be regarded as economically indefinite as old resources are recycled and new alternatives are assumed to be developed by the market. Simon challenged the notion of an impending Malthusian catastrophe‚Äîthat an increase in population has negative economic consequences; that population is a drain on natural resources; and that we stand at risk of running out of resources through over-consumption. Simon argues that population is the solution to resource scarcities and environmental problems, since people and markets innovate. His ideas were praised by Nobel Laureate economists Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, the latter in a 1998 foreword to The Ultimate Resource II, but they have also attracted critics such as Paul R. Ehrlich, Albert Allen Bartlett and Herman Daly. Simon examined different raw materials, especially metals and their prices in historical times. He assumed that besides temporary shortfalls, in the long run prices for raw materials remain at similar levels or even decrease. E.g. aluminium was never as expensive as before 1886 and steel used for medieval armor carried a much higher price tag in current dollars than any modern parallel. A recent discussion of commodity index long-term trends supported his positions. His 1984 book The Resourceful Earth (co-edited by Herman Kahn), is a similar criticism of the conventional wisdom on population growth and resource consumption and a direct response to the Global 2000 report. For example, it predicted that \\"There is no compelling reason to believe that world oil prices will rise in the coming decades. In fact, prices may well fall below current levels\\". Indeed, oil prices trended downward for nearly the next 2 decades, before rising above 1984 levels in about 2003 or 2004. Oil prices have subsequently risen and fallen, and risen again. In 2008, the price of crude oil reached $100 per barrel, a level last attained in the 1860s (inflation adjusted). Later in 2008, the price again sharply fell, to a low of about $40, before rising again to a high around $125. Since mid-2011, prices were slowly trending downward until the middle of 2014, but falling dramatically until the end of 2015 to ca. $30. Since then prices were relatively stable (below $50). Simon was skeptical, in 1994, of claims that human activity caused global environmental damage, notably in relation to CFCs, ozone depletion and climate change, the latter primarily because of the perceived rapid switch from fears of global cooling and a new ice age (in the mid-1970s) to the later fears of global warming. Simon also listed numerous claims about alleged environmental damage and health dangers from pollution as \\"definitely disproved\\". These included claims about lead pollution & IQ, DDT, PCBs, malathion, Agent Orange, asbestos, and the chemical contamination at Love Canal.The Ultimate Resource 2, pp. 260‚Äì65 He dismissed such concerns as a mere \\"value judgement.\\" =Influence= Simon was one of the founders of free-market environmentalism. An article entitled \\"The Doomslayer\\" profiling Julian Simon in Wired magazine inspired Danish Bj√∏rn Lomborg to write the book The Skeptical Environmentalist. Simon was also the first to suggest that airlines should provide incentives for travelers to give up their seats on overbooked flights, rather than arbitrarily taking random passengers off the plane (a practice known as \\"bumping\\"). Although the airline industry initially rejected it, his plan was later implemented with resounding success, as recounted by Milton Friedman in the foreword to The Ultimate Resource II. Economist James Heins said in 2009 that the practice had added $100 billion to the United States economy in the last 30 years. Simon gave away his idea to federal de- regulators and never received any personal profit from his solution. Although not all of Simon's arguments were universally accepted, they contributed to a shift in opinion in the literature on demographic economics from a strongly Malthusian negative view of population growth to a more neutral view. More recent theoretical developments, based on the ideas of the demographic dividend and demographic window, have contributed to another shift, this time away from the debate viewing population growth as either good or bad. Simon wrote a memoir, A Life Against the Grain, which was published by his wife after his death. Wagers with rivals =Paul R. Ehrlich ‚Äì first wager= Simon challenged Paul R. Ehrlich to a wager in 1980 over the price of metals a decade later; Simon had been challenging environmental scientists to the bet for some time. Ehrlich, John Harte, and John Holdren selected a basket of five metals that they thought would rise in price with increasing scarcity and depletion. Simon won the bet, with all five metals dropping in price. Supporters of Ehrlich's position suggest that much of this price drop came because of an oil spike driving prices up in 1980 and a recession driving prices down in 1990, pointing out that the price of the basket of metals actually rose from 1950 to 1975. They also suggest that Ehrlich did not consider the prices of these metals to be critical indicators, and that Ehrlich took the bet with great reluctance. On the other hand, Ehrlich selected the metals to be used himself, and at the time of the bet called it an \\"astonishing offer\\" that he was accepting \\"before other greedy people jump in.\\" The total supply in three of these metals (chromium, copper and nickel) increased during this time. Prices also declined for reasons specific to each of the five: * The price of tin went down because of an increased use of aluminium, a much more abundant, useful and inexpensive material. * Better mining technologies allowed for the discovery of vast nickel lodes, which ended the near monopoly that was enjoyed on the market. * Tungsten fell due to the rise of the use of ceramics in cookware. * The price of chromium fell due to better smelting techniques. * The price of copper began to fall due to the invention of fiber optic cable (which is derived from sand), which serves a number of the functions once reserved only for copper wire. In all of these cases, better technology allowed for either more efficient use of existing resources, or substitution with a more abundant and less expensive resource, as Simon predicted. =Paul R. Ehrlich ‚Äì proposed second wager= In 1995, Simon issued a challenge for a second bet. Ehrlich declined, and proposed instead that they bet on a metric for human welfare. Ehrlich offered Simon a set of 15 metrics over 10 years, victor to be determined by scientists chosen by the president of the National Academy of Sciences in 2005. There was no meeting of minds, because Simon felt that too many of the metric's measured attributes of the world were not directly related to human welfare, e.g. the amount of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere. For such indirect, supposedly bad indicators to be considered \\"bad\\", they would ultimately have to have some measurable detrimental effect on actual human welfare. Ehrlich refused to leave out measures considered by Simon to be immaterial. Simon summarized the bet with the following analogy: =David South= The same year as his second challenge to Ehrlich, Simon also began a wager with David South, professor of the Auburn University School of Forestry. The Simon / South wager concerned timber prices. Consistent with his cornucopian analysis of this issue in The Ultimate Resource, Simon wagered that at the end of a five-year term the consumer price of pine timber would have decreased; South wagered that it would increase. Before five years had elapsed, Simon saw that market and extra-market forces were driving up the price of timber, and he paid Professor South $1,000. Simon died before the agreed-upon date of the end of the bet, by which time timber prices had risen further. Simon's reasoning for his early exit out of the bet was due to \\"the far-reaching quantity and price effects of logging restrictions in the Pacific-northwest.\\" He believed this counted as interference from the U.S. government, which rendered the bet worthless according to his economic principles. Simon's bet only considered the possibility of prices being driven up by Alabama's government; he did not believe anything worthwhile was shown when U.S. logging restrictions drove the prices up.  Main statements and criticism  Jared Diamond in his book Collapse, Albert Bartlett and Garrett Hardin describe Simon as being too optimistic and some of his assumptions being not in line with natural limitations. Diamond claims that a continued stable growth rate of earth's population would result in extreme over-population long before the suggested time limit. Regarding the attributed population predictions Simon did not specify that he was assuming a fixed growth rate as Diamond, Bartlett and Hardin have done. Simon argued that people do not become poorer as the population expands; increasing numbers produce what they needed to support themselves, and have and will prosper while food prices sink. Diamond believes, and finds absurd, Simon implies it would be possible to produce metals, e.g. copper, from other elements.Diamond bases his criticism upon the fact that the transmutation of elements on a large scale is not currently possible. In theory, transmutation could allow humans to one day produce copper from other elements, but this would require significant breakthroughs in knowledge and technology in order to overcome the enormous barriers currently preventing this (i.e. the extremely large amounts of energy required to generate extremely small quantities) For Simon, human resource needs are comparably small compared to the wealth of nature. He therefore argued physical limitations play a minor role and shortages of raw materials tend to be local and temporary. The main scarcity pointed out by Simon is the amount of human brain power (i.e. \\"The Ultimate Resource\\") which allows for the perpetuation of human activities for practically unlimited time. For example, before copper ore became scarce and prices soared due to global increasing demand for copper wires and cablings, the global data and telecommunication networks have switched to glass fiber backbone networks. This and other quotations in Wired are supposed to be the reason for Bj√∏rn Lomborg's The Skeptical Environmentalist. Lomborg has stated that he began his research as an attempt to counter what he saw as Simons' anti-ecological arguments but changed his mind after starting to analyze the data. Legacy The Institute for the Study of Labor established the annual Julian L. Simon Lecture to honor Simon's work in population economics. The University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign held a symposium discussing Simon's work on April 24, 2002. The university also established the Julian Simon Memorial Faculty Scholar Endowment to fund an associate faculty member in the business school. India's Liberty Institute also holds a Julian Simon Memorial Lecture. The Competitive Enterprise Institute gives the Julian Simon Memorial Award annually to an economist in the vein of Simon; the first recipient was Stephen Moore, who had served as a research fellow under Simon in the 1980s. Personal life Simon was married to Rita James Simon, who was also a longtime member of the faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and later became a public affairs professor at American University. Simon suffered for a long time from depression, which allowed him to work only a few productive hours in a day. He also studied psychology of depression and wrote a book on overcoming it. Simon was Jewish. He died of a heart attack at his home in Chevy Chase in 1998 at age 65.

Portrayed by Jennifer Aniston, the character was created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and appeared in all of the show's 236 episodes during its decade-long run, from its premiere on September 22, 1994 to its finale on May 6, 2004. Introduced in the show's pilot as a na√Øve runaway bride who reunites with her childhood best friend Monica Geller and relocates to New York City, Rachel gradually evolves from a spoiled, inexperienced \\"daddy's girl\\" into a successful businesswoman. During the show's second season, the character becomes romantically involved with Monica's brother, Ross, with whom she maintains a complicated on-off relationship throughout the series. Together, the characters have a daughter, Emma. The role of Rachel was originally offered to T√©a Leoni, the producer's first choice, and Courteney Cox, both of whom declined, Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth, and Cox in favor of playing Rachel's best friend Monica in Friends. A virtually unknown actress at the time, who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms, Aniston auditioned for the role of Rachel after turning down an offer as a cast member on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. After acquiring the role and before Friends aired, Aniston was temporarily at risk of being recast because she had also been involved with another sitcom, Muddling Through, at the time, which was ultimately cancelled and allowed Aniston to remain on Friends. Critical reception towards Rachel has remained consistently positive throughout Friends decade-long run, with The A.V. Club attributing much of the show's early success to the character. However, some of her storylines have been criticized, specifically her romantic relationship with her friend Joey Tribbiani during season 10. Rachel's popularity established her as the show's breakout character, who has since been named one of the greatest television characters of all time, while the character's second season haircut spawned an international phenomenon of its own. Named the \\"Rachel\\" after her, the character's shag continues to be imitated by millions of women around the world and remains one of the most popular hairstyles in history, in spite of Aniston's own resentment of it. Rachel is also regarded as a style icon due to her influence on womenswear during the 1990s. Meanwhile, the character's relationship with Ross is often cited among television's most beloved. Rachel is considered to be Aniston's breakout role, credited with making her the show's most famous cast member and for spawning her successful film career. Praised for her performance as Rachel, Aniston won both an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series ‚Äì Comedy Or Musical.  Role  Rachel debuts in the pilot episode of Friends as a runaway bride who is distraught after abandoning her fianc√© Barry Farber (Mitchell Whitfield) at the altar. She locates her high school best friend Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), the only person she knows in New York City, who agrees to let Rachel reside with her while she attempts to reorganize her life. Rachel meets and befriends Monica's friends Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry), while reuniting with Monica's older brother Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), who has harbored unrequited romantic feelings for her since high school. Having previously relied on her parents' money her entire life with a sole goal of marrying wealthy, Rachel attempts to reinvent herself as an independent young woman by waitressing at Central Perk, a coffeehouse where her new friends regularly socialize. She is terrible at the job, but remains employed because the manager, Gunther (James Michael Tyler), is in love with her. As season one concludes, Rachel finds out that Ross is in love with her, and realizes that she loves him, too. When she goes to tell him, however, she finds that he has begun a relationship with a woman named Julie (Lauren Tom). However, Ross eventually chooses Rachel over Julie, and the couple dates for the remainder of the second season. However, their relationship begins to deteriorate during the middle of the third season after Rachel quits her job at the coffeehouse in favor of working in fashion. While Rachel becomes increasingly preoccupied with her new job, Ross grows jealous of her companionship with her coworker Mark (Steven Eckholdt), culminating in Rachel deciding that they should \\"take a break\\" from their relationship. Ross takes this to mean that they are breaking up, after calling Rachel and discovering Mark is with her, he sleeps with another woman. Rachel gets back together with Ross the next day, but breaks up with him upon learning of his infidelity. In the episodes following the break up, Rachel and Ross are initially hostile towards each other, but continue to harbor feelings for each other. During a beach house vacation with their friends, Rachel and Ross briefly reconcile when he ends his relationship with Bonnie (Christine Taylor), only to break up once again due to a disagreement shortly after returning to New York . During season four, Rachel dates her customer Joshua (Tate Donovan), while Ross dates her boss' niece Emily (Helen Baxendale), to whom he eventually gets engaged. Competitively, Rachel proposes to Joshua, frightening him off as his divorce is not yet finalised. Rachel indirectly contributes to the demise of Ross and Emily's relationship when she realises she still loves Ross and comes to London to stop their wedding; she decides not to act upon it when seeing how happy he is with Emily; but Ross accidentally utters Rachel's name while exchanging their wedding vows. Ross ultimately divorces a jealous Emily, choosing his friendship with Rachel instead. At the end of season five, Ross and Rachel drunkenly get married while vacationing with their friends in Las Vegas. In season six, Ross initially wants to remain married to Rachel but she persuades him to get the annulment. He tells Rachel he's done so but confesses to Phoebe that they're still married. Rachel eventually finds out and fills in the annulment form but their annulment request is denied because of Rachel having leveled unfounded allegations against Ross and because of their past relationship, forcing the two to file for a divorce instead. After signing the papers, they admit that if they ever got married properly, it would be the one that lasted. In season seven, Ross and Rachel secretly have sex, and Rachel unintentionally gets pregnant. Rachel gives birth to a girl in season eight, naming the baby Emma Geller-Green; the name Emma is a gift from Monica, who had previously been reserving the name for her own child. In a misunderstanding, Rachel believes that Joey had proposed to her, Joey having told her he loved her a few months earlier, whereas he'd simply picked up Ross's engagement ring. Rachel and Ross live together as non-romantic roommates during the first half of season nine. After an argument following Rachel kissing her colleague Gavin and giving her phone number to a guy at the bar, Rachel moves back in with Joey. At the end of season nine, Joey confesses that he still has feelings for Rachel, and they decide to try dating. They break up in season ten, however, both because their romance upsets Ross and because they realize that they don't work as a couple. Rachel eventually finds a job opportunity in France, but has second thoughts when Ross tells her he still loves her. Rachel ultimately decides to stay and reignite her relationship with Ross, getting off the plane at the last minute. In the first episode of the spin-off/sequel Joey, it appears that Ross and Rachel were remarried shortly after the events of season 10 as Joey tells his sister Gina that all of his friends have got married. In the episode \\"Joey and the Breakup\\", while discussing his relationship with Sarah, Joey mentions Rachel, though not by name, to Alex as the only woman he ever confessed his love to, which led to brief heartbreak when Rachel did not reciprocate his feelings (as Joey puts it, \\"We were living together, she was pregnant with my best friend's baby and she ended up with him.\\").  Development  = Conception and writing = After their short-lived television series Family Album was canceled, television writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman pitched Friends to then-NBC president Warren Littlefield as a sitcom about \\"that special time in your life when your friends are your family,\\" basing the show on their own experiences as young people living in New York; the main characters themselves were inspired by their own friends. Conceived as a young woman who is unprepared for adulthood, the character Rachel Green (occasionally spelled Greene) was originally named Rachel Robbins in the pilot. Although critics and audiences initially perceived Monica as the show's main character when Friends premiered, the writers had actually given Rachel the pilot's most prominent storyline. Before deciding that Rachel and Ross would be an item for the entire series, the writers had originally intended for the show's defining couple to be Joey and Monica. However, after the success of the pilot, in which Rachel and Ross' developing romance is first hinted at, and witnessing Aniston and co-star David Schwimmer's on-screen chemistry for the first time, Crane and Kauffman determined that the entire series relied on \\"finding all the wonderful roadblocks for them to be with each other.\\" Audiences began rooting for Rachel and Ross' union since the very beginning of Friends, openly voicing their frustration with Rachel's obliviousness to Ross' feelings for her. The episode that would ultimately transform the friends' relationship for the remainder of the series was the first-season finale \\"The One Where Rachel Finds Out\\", in which Rachel finally learns of Ross' true feelings for her, at the same time discovering she actually feels the same. However, the episode nearly went unwritten because, at the time, few Friends writers were expecting the couple's relationship to morph into the phenomenon that it ultimately became. The episode was first suggested by director James Burrows; the writers felt that it was time to alter the couple's dynamic in order to avoid the repetitive \\"he's pining, she's oblivious\\" pattern, using the work of author Jane Austen as inspiration on how to finally shift the pining arc from Ross to Rachel. Because stakes for the episode were unprecedentedly high, \\"The One Where Rachel Finds Out\\" became Friends' most reworked episode. The couple's first kiss at the end of season two's \\"The One Where Ross Finds Out\\" was met with deafening applause from the studio audience. Crane admitted that keeping viewers interested in their relationship for ten years was challenging. Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph believes that they accomplished this by \\"dangl[ing] the possibility of a Ross and Rachel recoupling through several cliffhangers without ever putting them back together.\\" According to Encyclopedia of Television author Horace Newcomb, Ross and Rachel's ever-changing relationship \\"converted the traditional amnesic plotlines of the situation comedy into ones akin to episodic drama.\\" Meanwhile, writing for The New York Review of Books, Elaine Blair agreed that Friends created \\"a sense of chemistry between two characters while also putting obstacles in their way, setting us up for a long-deferred union.\\" After Rachel and Ross drunkenly get married while on vacation in Las Vegas during season five, Schwimmer had initially objected to the idea of having his character Ross divorce her ‚Äì his third divorce ‚Äì because he felt that it was taking it \\"too far.\\" The actor explained that \\"The whole arc of the relationship was weird then ... because for [Ross] to be able to move on enough to marry someone else and then go back to being in love with Rachel later just went a bit too far.\\" Rachel and Joey's romantic storyline was conceived because the writers wanted to delay Ross and Rachel's reunion further. Crane felt that pairing Rachel and Joey during season ten \\"was for the greater good\\" because \\"It was inappropriate.\\" However, the cast initially protested the idea, fearing that Rachel, Joey, and Ross would ultimately become unlikeable characters and audiences would either \\"resent Joey for going after a pregnant woman, or resent Rachel for rejecting him, or resent Ross for standing between the two of them.\\" Meanwhile, the writers also approached the concept of Rachel's pregnancy and baby tentatively, worrying about how they would include it in the show because they did not want Friends \\"to become a show about a baby\\" while \\"On the other hand, we don't want to pretend that there isn't one.\\" According to Robert Bianco of USA Today, the critical success and popularity of Rachel's pregnancy is ultimately responsible for \\"propel[ling] the show to the top of the ratings\\". When it finally came time to write the series finale, \\"The only thing [Crane and Kauffman] absolutely knew from very early on was that we had to get Ross and Rachel together,\\" deciding, \\"We had dicked the audience around for 10 years with their 'will they or won‚Äôt they,' and we didn‚Äôt see any advantage in frustrating them\\" any longer. However, at one point the writers had deliberated ending the series with Ross and Rachel in \\"a gray area of where they aren‚Äôt together, but we hint there‚Äôs a sense that they might be down the road.\\" Ultimately, Crane and Kauffman relented in favor of giving the audience what they wanted. = Casting = The final character to be cast, Rachel is portrayed by actress Jennifer Aniston, who auditioned for the role shortly after declining a position as a cast member on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. Her decision was initially ridiculed by both her friends as well as actor Adam Sandler, a Saturday Night Live alum. Actress T√©a Leoni, who at the time was being referred to by the media as \\"the next Lucille Ball\\", was offered the role of Rachel as the studio's first choice, but she declined in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth. Actress Elizabeth Berkley also auditioned for the role. Other actresses who auditioned for Rachel include Denise Richards, Melissa Rivers, Nicollette Sheridan, Parker Posey, and Jami Gertz. Originally, the producers wanted to cast actress Courteney Cox as Rachel, who Crane and Kauffman were particularly drawn to because of her \\"cheery, upbeat energy.\\" Additionally, Cox was the most famous cast member at the time amidst an ensemble of relatively unknown actors. However, the actress lobbied for the role of Rachel's best friend Monica, as whom she was ultimately cast, because she felt that she was not \\"quirky\\" enough to play Rachel. At the same time, although unbeknownst to each other, Aniston was being considered for the role of Monica, but fought to play Rachel because she felt that the character suited her better. At one point, Cox had begun to regret her decision to play Monica until her own character's storylines started improving. Upon being cast as Rachel in Friends ‚Äì her sixth sitcom effort ‚Äì actress Jennifer Aniston was nearly recast due to her involvement with another developing sitcom, Muddling Through, at the time. The producers had originally wanted Aniston to audition for the role of Monica. Friends was Aniston's sixth sitcom; each of her previous ventures had been canceled prematurely. Feeling vulnerable, Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career, who encouraged her to audition for Friends, which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time. Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this. However, casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because, at the time, Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through, in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years. CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract, which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously, traveling back-and-forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks. Meanwhile, NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel, replace Aniston, and reshoot several episodes if CBS' series proved successful, which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars. However, Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail. Essentially, the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered, while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends. During this time of uncertainty, Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends-related promotions and photo shoots; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced. Aniston explained, \\"When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they didn't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel.\\" Director James Burrows admitted that Aniston had been cast in second position. The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part, while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her, \\"I'm auditioning for your part in Friends.\\" Ultimately, Muddling Through was canceled after only three months and ten episodes, two weeks before the pilot of Friends aired, thus allowing Aniston to keep her role on the show, becoming its second youngest cast member at the age of 25. Crane appreciated Aniston's interpretation of Rachel because \\"in the wrong hands Rachel is kind of annoying and spoiled and unlikable,\\" commending the actress for \\"breathing life into a difficult character.\\" Crane and Kauffman strongly envisioned Friends as an ensemble comedy, and Warner Bros. initially marketed the show as such by having the cast appear in their entirety for all press, interviews and photo shoots. One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy, family sitcom or star a famous comedian, Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show's main characters are \\"of equal importance.\\" As a writer, Crane preferred it this way because \\"utilizing six equal players, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for myriad story lines.\\" Kauffman echoed \\"that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage.\\" The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically. The show's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast. Famously, the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries, refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three, which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten ‚Äì approximately $25 million per year. Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Aniston became the highest-paid television actress of all time. By then, Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the \\"Rachel\\" and successfully transitioning into a film career, combined with her high-profile relationship with her then-husband, actor Brad Pitt, who had once guest starred in an episode of the show. At times the producers would use the actress' popularity to boost the show's ratings, notably her character's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc. Aniston had been telling the press that the show's ninth season would be her last, and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season. She explained to NBC's Matt Lauer, \\"I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high. And then I was also feeling like, ‚ÄòHow much more of Rachel do I have in me?‚Äô‚Äù However, the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of Friends, which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate Aniston's busy film schedule.  Characterization and themes  Rachel is the youngest of Friends six main characters. She was brought up in Long Island, New York. The term \\"spoiled\\" is often used to describe the character's personality during her early appearances. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica describes Rachel as a spoiled and funny character. According to Rachel's original character description, written by Crane and Kauffman themselves for the show's pilot, the character is a spoiled yet courageous young woman who \\"has worked for none of what she has\\", unlike best friend Monica, and is initially \\"equipped to do nothing\\". James Endrst of the Hartford Courant identified her as \\"a spoiled rich kid\\", while the Daily News dubbed Rachel an \\"endearingly spoiled Daddy's girl.\\" Author Kim Etingoff wrote about Rachel in her book Jennifer Aniston: From Friends to Films that the character is \\"spunky and sometimes spoiled\\", while TV Land called her \\"naive.\\" Citing the differences between Rachel and her two female friends, The Guardians Ryan Gilbey observed that the character \\"wasn't insulated by self-regard, like Monica, or swaddled in gormlessness, like Phoebe.\\" Frequently identified as fitting the \\"girl next door\\" archetype, Anne Bilson of The Telegraph described Rachel as \\"funny but not too funny, pretty but not too pretty, sexy but not too sexy, scatterbrained but not too scatterbrained.\\" TalkTalk's Dominic Wills described the character as \\"smart but ditzy, determined but undisciplined.\\" Meanwhile, Liat Kornowski, writing for The Huffington Post, scribed that Rachel is a \\"beautiful, coveted, slightly neurotic, borderline egocentric\\" character. Observing that the show's main characters are each based on a stereotype, Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph identified Rachel as \\"the self-absorbed one who goes from riches to rags.\\" According to Reign Magazine, Rachel is \\"a human being full of vulnerability, humor and strength while aesthetically donning an undeniable beauty and allure.\\" Originally depicted as a character who is unprepared for \\"the world as an adult\\", Rachel's personality was gradually tailored to suit Aniston as the series progressed, becoming \\"more self-sufficient and sympathetic.\\" According to Shining in the Shadows: Movie Stars of the 2000s author Murray Pomerance, \\"The more boundary collapsed between the 'real' Jennifer Aniston and Rachel, the more 'authentic' Aniston became.\\" Pomerance also noted that the character's \\"well-roundedness, normalcy and relatability\\" is similar to Aniston's, while both the character and the actress herself are very expressive, talking \\"with [their] hands a good deal.\\" In her book How To Write For Television, author Madeline Dimaggio wrote that although \\"Rachel grew within the context of the series ... she would always struggle with the spoiled, image-conscious Daddy's girl who fled from her wedding in the pilot.\\" Similarly, BuddyTV wrote that although Rachel \\"eventually evolves into being less absorbed in later series, she [remains] the most image-centric among the six\\", while Vogue's Edward Barsamian opined, \\"She might have been self-centered and bratty, but Rachel Green was perhaps the most stylish and unabashedly fashion-obsessed character on the show.\\" TV Land summarized the character's arc and development in the website's biography of her, writing, \\"Rachel is a born shopper, but... she‚Äôs not necessarily a born worker. In fact, before moving in with Monica, she‚Äôs never had to work at all, thanks to the generosity of her parents. Luckily, Rachel is smart, resourceful and chic, so her future is bright, both as a member of the workforce and with her newfound tribe.\\" Examining the character's sexuality, Splitsider's Mike D'Avria determined that Rachel has had the third most sexual partners, 14, as well as the highest percentage of serious monogamous relationships at 71%. D'Avria opined, \\"Throughout the whole series Rachel is continually meeting men she wants to impress. Her flirtations typically fail, but she somehow winds up in a serious relationship with them.\\" Additionally, Rachel is also the only female character to admit to having had a homosexual experience (Chandler having likewise admitted to kissing a man on season 7, episode 4). In an interview with the Jewish Telegraph, Kauffman confirmed that Rachel is Jewish. On the character's \\"Jewish ties\\", Kauffman told j. that Rachel had always been Jewish \\"in our minds\\", explaining, \\"You can‚Äôt create a character with the name 'Rachel Green' and not from the get-go make some character choices\\". Prior to this, critics and fans had long speculated whether or not Rachel is Jewish. Vulture's Lindsey Weber, who identifies herself as Jewish, observed several similarities and Jewish stereotypes she shares with the character, citing the facts that Rachel refers to her grandmother Ida Green as \\"Bubbe\\", Long Island origin, and engagement to a Jewish doctor as allusions to the character's Jewish culture. In her book Changed for Good: A Feminist History of the Broadway Musical, author Stacy Wolf identified Rachel as one of several popular female television characters who embodied Jewish stereotypes during the 1990s and often served as \\"the butt of the shows' jokes.\\" Meanwhile, JDate's Rebecca Frankel cited Rachel as one of the earliest and most prominent examples of the Jewish American Princess stereotype on screen. Writing for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Alicia R. Korenman also acknowledged Rachel's initial Jewish American Princess qualities, describing her as \\"spoiled, dependent on her father's money and her fiance's, is horrified at the thought of working for a living and generally inept in her attempts to do so, and is eventually revealed to have had a nose job\\", which she eventually overcomes as they become less \\"evident in later seasons of the show\\". In his article \\"Princesses, Schlemiels, Punishers and Overbearing Mothers\\", Evan Cooper described Rachel as a \\"de-semitized\\" Jew because, aside from her name, \\"there is never any discussion of experiences of growing up in a Jewish culture, no use of Yiddish, and few, if any, references to family members with distinctively Jewish surnames\\". Cooper continued to write that although Rachel possesses some Jewish American Princess traits, she is more similar to the \\"little woman\\" stereotype. The New York Post's Robert Rorke labeled Rachel \\"a rehabilitated Jewish American Princess\\", in contrast to her sister Amy (Christina Applegate) who remains \\"selfish, condescending and narcissistic.\\"  Critical reception  Critical response towards Rachel remained mostly positive throughout the show's ten-season run. Writing for The A.V. Club, John Reid believes that Rachel is responsible for the success of the pilot, explaining, \\"The story of this group of friends must start with a stranger coming to town,\\" describing Rachel as \\"the perfect stranger for this plot\\". Reid also holds Rachel responsible for spurring character development in the show's five other main characters, calling her arrival \\"a catalyst for all of them to grow, because unlike the rest of them, Rachel is interested in finding meaning for her life\\". Also writing for The A.V. Club, Sonia Saraiya enjoyed Rachel's first awkward encounter with Ross because, for the first time, \\"Rachel displays a moment of true empathy for another human being\\". Saraiya went on to hail Rachel as \\"a model for women coming of age in the 1990s‚Äîthe popular, pretty girl dissatisfied with where those illusions have taken her but also unwilling to embrace the more aggressively 'feminist' career-woman strategy\\". The New York Times' Joseph Hanania enjoyed Rachel's telephone conversation with her father during the pilot, describing it as \\"hilarious.\\" The Los Angeles Times Bob Shayne admitted his attraction towards Rachel, joking, \\"my feelings for Rachel, I say with some embarrassment, mirror those of Gunther\\". Cosmopolitan touted Rachel \\"the best fictional gal pal we've ever had\\". While People called her \\"spoiled-but-lovable\\", TV Guide described Rachel as \\"neurotic and adorable\\". Writing for Heat, Ellen Kerry hailed Rachel's gradual transformation from waitress to businesswoman as arguably \\"the best thing on tv.\\" USA Today's Robert Bianco credits Rachel's pregnancy storyline with saving Friends, observing that the arc increased the show's ratings while ultimately \\"reversing the show's decline in ways ... that no one watching 'The One With Monica & Chandler's Wedding' could ever have imagined.\\" Bianco concluded, \\"Indeed, without that fortune-altering twist, Friends probably would have ended sooner\\". BDCwire ranked \\"The One With The Ball\\", \\"The One With Rachel‚Äôs Inadvertent Kiss\\", \\"The One With The Football\\", \\"The One With The Fake Party\\" and \\"The One In Vegas, Part One\\" Rachel's five strongest episodes. Meanwhile, TVLine criticized Rachel for sleeping with ex-fianc√© Barry in season one's \\"The One With the Evil Orthodontist\\", panning the episode as \\"cringeworthy\\". TVLine similarly criticized the character's role in season four's \\"The One With The Fake Party\\". At times the character would generate mild controversy, specifically the second-season episode \\"The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies\\", during which Rachel and Monica argue over who will get to use the last remaining condom in the apartment, which Rachel ultimately wins via a game of rock-paper-scissors. Additionally, fans would often approach Aniston and scold her for decisions that Rachel makes within the show that they do not particularly agree with. Within the first two seasons of Friends, the character became extremely popular among women. Viewers' perpetual desire to see Rachel succeed helped her remain a fan favorite throughout all ten seasons of the show. Writing for TalkTalk, Dominic Wills agreed that while Rachel established herself as \\"the general favourite ... No one had a bad word to say about Jennifer Aniston\\", with whose performance audiences instantly fell in love. Aniston's performance has been consistently praised since her debut in the pilot, about which Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker wrote that the actress portrays Rachel with \\"prickly intelligence\\". Writing for The Baltimore Sun, David Zurawik cited Aniston among the show's \\"very strong cast\\", while Variety's Tony Scott agreed that \\"All six of the principals ... appear resourceful and display sharp sitcom skills\\"; Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette praised the work of show's female cast equally. TV Guide wrote that Aniston \\"instantly charmed audiences with her perfect looks and endearingly flawed persona\\", while Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast referred to Aniston's tenure on Friends as not \\"a leading lady performance\\" but instead \\"the work of a brilliant character actress.\\" The Guardian's Ryan Gilbey highlighted Aniston as the cast member \\"least reliant on goofball caricature\\", observing that \\"Playing the only character with whom a sane viewer might reasonably identify also meant that she got the lion's share of attention\\". Writing that the actress \\"quickly stole our hearts as the daddy‚Äôs girl and aspiring fashionista,\\" Andrew Collins of Radio Times hailed Aniston as a \\"natural comic performer, as adept with a subtle nose wrinkle as a full-on pratfall, and fluent in quick-fire patter\\". In 2002, Aniston won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. In 2003, the actress won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series ‚Äì Comedy Or Musical. Dominic Willis of TalkTalk believes that Aniston won these awards because of \\"her brilliant comic performances in the show.\\" = Relationships = Rachel has had several romantic relationships throughout Friends decade-long run, the most famous and prominent of which remains her on-again, off-again relationship with friend Ross. Although wildly popular among audiences, the couple has been met with mixed reviews from critics. Katherine Hassel of the Daily Express described the characters' relationship as \\"the heart of the show\\". China Daily cited Ross and Rachel's reunion during the series finale \\"The Last One\\" among the episode's highlights, while Gary Susman of Rolling Stone believes that audiences would not have been happy had the couple not ultimately reunited. Contrastingly, The Wire's Joe Reid is of the opinion that the show's second season is \\"the only time Ross/Rachel was truly great\\". Virgin Media wrote that the couple's dynamics \\"had grown mightily tedious\\" by season ten. E! cable network ranked Rachel and Ross the ninth greatest Friends couple, writing that their relationship gave \\"Friends fans enough iconic quotes to fill a book\\", considering Phoebe's line \\"See? [Ross is] her lobster!\\" to be among show's most iconic. Ross and Rachel's season three breakup has spawned a debate among Friends fans, who continue to argue over which of the two was at fault: Rachel for suggesting that they take a break from their relationship, or Ross for sleeping with another woman immediately afterwards. Writing for E!, Jenna Mullins ruled in favor of Rachel, elaborating, \\"there is no excuse for Ross sleeping with someone else after his lobster suggested taking a break\\", concluding that Ross \\"blew it\\". The Jewish community was particularly receptive to the fact that a Jewish-American couple existed on prime time television, described by Lilith magazine as \\"a televisual first\\". Rachel and Ross are considered to be among television's greatest and most beloved couples. Ninemsn referred to them as \\"everyone's favourite on ... off ... on (a break!) duo,\\" while Us Weekly and BuzzFeed ranked them the first and second best television couple, respectively. TV Guide ranked Ross and Rachel the third greatest television couple, dubbing them \\"the most iconic TV couple in recent memory\\". Extra placed the couple at number eight, writing, \\"Never did we want two people to get together more than Ross ... and Rachel\\". Refinery29 included Rachel and Ross in the website's \\"16 TV Couples We Want To Be Together Forever\\" list. The pair is also often ranked among television's greatest \\"will they or won't they\\" couples. Naming Ross and Rachel the greatest \\"will they, won't they\\" couple, Network Ten believes they defined the term, while Suggest dubbed them \\"The quintessential will they/won‚Äôt they couple.\\" According to Sarah Doran of Radio Times, the couple \\"became synonymous with the phrase 'we're on a break'\\". Phoebe's line, in which she refers to the couple as each other's lobsters, has become one of the show's most popular and oft-quoted. Kaitlin Reilly of Bustle magazine defined the term as \\"the person of whom another is meant to be with forever\\". Tara Aquino of Complex magazine believes that \\"Every other person can tell you what exactly a 'Ross and Rachel' relationship means\\". Ultimately, Rachel's season eight pregnancy arc is credited with reviving the show's ratings and reviews. During season ten, Rachel's brief romance with friend Joey drew strong criticism from both critics and fans, although the contested relationship did not harm viewership. Joshua Kurp of Splitsider believes that the Rachel/Joey/Ross love triangle is the main reason the show's final two seasons continued to perform well despite mediocre reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN referred to the Rachel-Joey storyline as \\"questionable.\\" Entertainment Tonight Canada ranked \\"The One After Rachel and Joey Kiss\\" among the show's ten worst episodes at number five, with author I. P. Johnson panning it as \\"desperate\\", concluding, \\"Jeers for even conceiving this romantic plot; cheers for abandoning it\\". Contrarily, E! enjoyed Rachel and Joey as a couple because they brought out positive aspects in each other's personalities and share a similar sense of humor. Their relationship also spawned a debate among fans, who argued over whether making Rachel and Joey a couple was a bad idea. Jenna Mullins of E! determined that it is because \\"It was too far into the series to throw these two together. They didn't make sense and their romantic scenes felt forced\\". After Ross and Rachel's break up, there were many hints that they would eventually reunite forever, especially seasons 8-10. In the final season, Rachel wants to sleep with Ross when her father has a heart attack and wants \\"sympathy sex\\", which he turns down, not wanting to take advantage of her in the state she is in. However, Ross and Rachel do sleep together again the night before she leaves for Paris, which results in him admitting he still loves her and wants to get back together in the series finale. Rachel turns down the Paris job in order to be with Ross when she realizes she still loves him too, and the two agree \\"this is it\\", getting back together for good. Jennifer Aniston, who played Rachel, confirmed that after the series finale, Ross and Rachel got remarried, happily and had at least one more child.  Impact and legacy  Rachel's popularity would establish her as the show's breakout character; she is often ranked among the greatest characters in television history. Us Weekly ranked Rachel the most beloved television character of the past two decades, citing her as \\"one of TV's most endearing personalities\\". Entertainment Weekly ranked the character sixth on a similar countdown, while AOL TV included Rachel among television's hundred \\"Greatest Women\\" at number 23, with author Kim Potts observing that \\"Rachel became one of viewers' favorite Friends because she grew from what could have been a one- note character ... into a more independent, caring pal\\". BuddyTV ranked Rachel the 15th funniest female character in sitcom history, while ChaCha collectively ranked Rachel, Monica and Phoebe 11th, 12th and 13th on the website's list of the \\"Top 16 Female TV Characters of All Time\\". According to The Hollywood Reporter, Hollywood professionals voted Rachel the 29th best female character in 2016. In 2019, Harper's Bazaar ranked Rachel the third most influential \\"female character who changed our TV screens\\". Author Olivia Blair wrote that Rachel \\"promote ideals of female independence, unashamedly discuss sex and female pleasure, educate the men in their lives on how to treat women throughout the ten seasons.\\" Writing for Entertainmentwise, Georgina Littlejohn believes Rachel inspired the character Penny in the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, noting that the characters, both waitresses, are \\"blonde, cute, funny, likeable girls-next-door\\". Several baby name books and websites commonly associate the name \\"Rachel\\" with the character. Both Rachel and Aniston became fashion icons due to their combined influence on womenswear during the 1990s, particularly among British women. Vogue's Edward Barsamian credits Rachel with inspiring \\"the cool New York look\\". According to Stylist, Rachel \\"revived [a] love of denim shirts and dungarees\\", while Mahogany Clayton of StyleBlazer believes that the character \\"managed to dominate every fashion trend that passed by her radar in the most stylish ways possible\\". Hailing her as the \\"Fash Queen\\", Heat magazine observed the character's influence on plaid skirts, denim and overalls. Citing every costume the character wore during the first season of Friends, BuzzFeed determined that Rachel popularized the mullet dress. TV Guide published a list of \\"The 17 Ways Rachel from Friends Changed '90s Fashion\\". Rachel is often considered to be one of television's best dressed characters. Elle included Rachel in the magazine's \\"50 Best Dressed Women on TV\\" list. PopSugar ranked Friends 15th on the website's list of \\"50 TV Shows That Changed the Way We Dress\\", citing Rachel's \\"impressive\\" wardrobe. InStyle ranked Friends the 36th most fashionable television show of all-time, praising Rachel, Monica and Phoebe's costumes. StyleCaster ranked Rachel among \\"The 50 Most Stylish TV Characters Of All Time\\" at number 28. Cosmopolitan magazine compiled a list of \\"16 things Rachel Green wore to work that we'd totally wear today\\", while Virgin Media ranked the character among television's sexiest. Brides magazine ranked Rachel's wedding dress among \\"The Best TV Wedding Dresses\\", with contributor Jane Frankfort commending the dress with \\"set[ting] the tone for the following 10 years together and the many milestones our favorite friends will bring.\\" Like her character, Aniston became the show's breakout star. Karen Thomas of USA Today dubbed Aniston \\"our favorite Friend\\". According to Turner Classic Movies, Aniston ultimately became \\"One of the most popular television actresses of her era\\". According to Jennifer Aniston: From Friends to Films author Kim Etingoff, the actress' own fame \\"outshone\\" those of her co-stars, becoming the first cast member to \\"rise to prominence\\"; the actress continues to experience the most post-Friends success. Aniston's performance in Friends led to a successful film career. According to The Inquisitr News, Rachel is \\"the role that would end up launching [Aniston's] success\\", while Bradford Evans of Splitsider believes \\"that Jennifer Aniston likely wouldn't have become a major movie star without Friends\\". While ranking Aniston the most attractive sitcom star of the 1990s, Josh Robertson of Complex magazine wrote that \\"With the haircut, the TV fame, and a true gift for comedy ... combined, Aniston became a big star\\", replacing Cox as the show's \\"established hottie\\". According to Steve Charnock of Yahoo! Movies, Aniston is \\"the series' only main cast member to become a bona fide movie star since the end of the show\\". While agreeing that Aniston's film career has been successful, several critics believe that the actress' filmography remains limited to playing Rachel-like roles in romantic comedies, save for some exceptions. Ryan Gilbey of The Guardian noted that \\"Consequently, many of Aniston's movie roles ... have been Rachel in all but name.\\" Andrew Collins of Radio Times agreed, writing that Aniston \\"seems trapped, perpetually playing variations of Rachel\\". According to TV Guide, Aniston is \\"usually called upon to play a variation of her neurotic and adorable Friends character\\". Aniston cites Rachel as one of three roles for which she is most grateful, to whom she \\"owe[s] everything\\". On being typecast in the aftermath of Rachel, Aniston admits that at times it \\"gives you more of a challenge, to shape people‚Äôs perceptions of you\\". as audiences struggle \\"to lose the Rachel tag that has made her one of the world's most recognisable faces\\". = Hair = Named after the character, the \\"Rachel\\" refers to a bouncy layered shag inspired by the way in which Aniston wore her hair on Friends between 1994 and 1996, during the first and second seasons of the series. The \\"Rachel\\" debuted in the show's 20th episode, \\"The One With the Evil Orthodontist\\". Aniston believes that her hair stylist, Chris McMillan, created the haircut while he was under the influence of marijuana. The \\"Rachel\\" immediately became popular among women, launching an international hair trend. The popularity of the \\"Rachel\\" coincided with the popularity of Friends during the mid-to-late-1990s. Marie Claire estimates that 11 million women donned the hairstyle throughout the decade, while the Daily Express determined that the hairstyle was most popular among British women, who went to hair salons \\"clutching magazine pictures of Aniston\\" and asking hairdressers to give them the look. Jennifer Aniston portraying her character while donning the famous \\"Rachel\\" haircut during the second-season episode \\"The One with Phoebe's Husband\\". The hairstyle would go on to become one of the most popular of all time. According to Vanity Fair, the hairstyle's \\"widespread popularity ... in the show‚Äôs very first year cemented the sitcom early on as heavily influential when it came to style.\\" The \\"Rachel\\" remains one of the most popular hairstyles in history, and became the most popular hairstyle in the United States since actress Farrah Fawcett's. Hair stylists credit its appeal and popularity to its medium length and volume, combined with its tendency to frame the face flatteringly. Hairdresser Mark Woolley described it as \\"a cut that flatters almost everyone, designed to make women look beautiful\\". The \\"Rachel\\" is often ranked among the greatest and most iconic hairstyles of all-time, with Redbook placing it at number four and Time ranking it ninth. The Huffington Post determined that the hairstyle is one of \\"The Most Famous TV Hairstyles Of All Time\\". US Weekly ranked the \\"Rachel\\" the 17th most iconic hairstyle. Glamour magazine ranked the \\"Rachel\\" fourth on the magazine's list of \\"The 100 Best Hairstyles of All Time\\". The magazine also cited it among \\"The very best hair to have graced the small screen\\", while ranking it the most memorable hairstyle in television history. The Sydney Morning Herald ranked it the second greatest television hairstyle, while Metro ranked the \\"Rachel\\" the character's second-best hairstyle. Ranked sixth on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \\"25 Fashion Moments That Changed Entertainment\\", the haircut was declared the most \\"desired\\" hairstyle of the Clinton era. Zahra Barnes of Self joked that Rachel's hair has always been the \\"true star of the show\\". Lauding the \\"Rachel\\" as one of television's greatest hairstyles, Sarah Carrillo of Elle magazine believed that its popularity \\"helped make Friends the phenomenon it was\\". Opining that Friends spawned few memorable catchphrases in comparison to its contemporaries, Tom Jicha of The Baltimore Sun attributes much of the show's legacy to the hairstyle, calling it the show's \\"only cultural trend\\". Josh Robertson of Complex magazine felt that \\"With the haircut, the TV fame, and a true gift for comedy ... combined, Aniston became a big star\\", replacing Courteney Cox. Hannah Lyons Powell of Glamour agreed that the hairstyle made Aniston \\"the definitive hair icon of the ‚Äò90s and the proud owner of arguably the most infamous and influential hairstyle of all time.\\" According to Jim Vorel of Paste magazine, \\"'the Rachel' hairstyle became the decade‚Äôs defining 'do, calling it \\"the definition of influence\\". However, Rebecca Cox of Glamour is grateful that the hairstyle remained in the 1990s. In the second-season episode \\"The One With The Lesbian Wedding\\", Rachel references the popularity of her haircut when she complains that her own overbearing mother is trying to reinvent her life after hers, lamenting, \\"Couldn't she just copy my haircut?\\" Despite her association with the cut, Aniston disliked the hairstyle. She found maintaining the hairstyle without McMillan's help difficult, stating \\"I'd curse Chris every time I had to blowdry. It took three brushes‚Äîit was like doing surgery!\\" and that she would rather shave her head than have to wear it for the rest of her life. Since Aniston, several other celebrities have worn variations of the \\"Rachel\\", among them actresses Cameron Diaz, Rachel McAdams, Emma Watson, Reese Witherspoon, Julia Roberts, comedian Tina Fey, model Tyra Banks, and singer Lily Allen.

His past clubs include Paris Saint- Germain, Lens and Liverpool, with whom he won the FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Cup and UEFA Super Cup in 2001. He then guided Olympique Lyonnais to two French titles, before announcing his resignation on 25 May 2007. He became manager of Aston Villa in September 2010. He also coached the France national team between 1992 and 1993. He assisted Aim√© Jacquet in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, was part of UEFA's and FIFA's Technical Committee in the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cup finals, and technical director for the French Football Federation during the 2010 finals. In June 2011, he stepped down from club coaching, leaving his managerial role at Aston Villa, following frequent hospitalisation over heart problems. Since July 2012, Houllier has been head of global football for Red Bull. He is responsible for Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg, Germany's RB Leipzig and American club New York Red Bulls, as well as the now dissolved Red Bull Brasil and Red Bull Ghana academies. Club career Houllier entered Lille University to pursue a degree in English, but in the first year his father's serious illness forced him to drop out of full-time study and start work, eventually as a school teacher, while he completed his degree part-time. As part of his degree, he elected to spend a year in 1969‚Äì1970 in the city of Liverpool as an assistant at Alsop Comprehensive School, and while there he attended his first Liverpool F.C. match on 16 September 1969, a 10‚Äì0 thrashing of Irish club Dundalk. He also played for an amateur local side, Alsop. He was an enthusiastic footballer, but never threatened the professional ranks as a player. He was deputy headmaster of the √âcole Normale d'Arras until reaching age 26 in 1973, when he began his full- time managerial career as player-manager of Le Touquet. Managerial career =In France= Later, Houllier moved to Arras as youth coach, and N≈ìux-les- Mines as head coach where he won two consecutive promotions into the second division before moving to Lens in 1982. He took Lens to promotion and qualification for the UEFA Cup before moving to Paris Saint-Germain in 1985, where PSG won the French title the following year. In 1988, Houllier was appointed technical director and assistant to the France national team, under manager Michel Platini. Houllier became manager in 1992, but resigned in November 1993 after France failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup finals. In October 2011, a new book on football coaching, Secrets de coachs (Coaches' Secrets), was published. In that book, Houllier blamed France's 2‚Äì1 defeat by Bulgaria on winger David Ginola's missed cross that allowed Bulgaria to launch a decisive counter-attack and score their winning goal in the final minute of the final qualifying group match in Paris on 17 November 1993. In response to Houllier allegedly making disparaging remarks on Ginola and referring to Ginola in offensive terms in that book in relation to Ginola's fatal error in that match, Ginola filed a lawsuit for alleged defamation against Houllier. The lawsuit was dismissed by a French court in April 2012. Regardless, Houllier remained with the team as a technical director. In 1998, France won the World Cup, and Houllier was recognised for his contributions to the game. He was the technical director for the French Football Federation (FFF) during France's first round debacle at the 2010 World Cup, criticising coach Raymond Domenech for his isolated method of management. In the wake of that debacle, Houllier did not call for the then-FFF president Jean-Pierre Escalettes to resign; instead, he stated that Escalettes should remain in his post. =Liverpool= In July 1998, Houllier was invited to become joint team manager of Liverpool, together with Roy Evans. The arrangement did not work out and Evans resigned in November after losing to Tottenham Hotspur 3‚Äì1 at home in the League Cup on 10 November 1998. Prior to the defeat, Liverpool were eliminated from the UEFA Cup by Spanish side Celta de Vigo. The departure of Evans left Houllier in sole charge of the team. Houllier began what he described as a five-year programme to rebuild the team, and restore discipline to a squad that had been labelled widely as \\"Spice Boys\\", as well as begin a continental approach both tactically as well as in terms of personnel, to the game starting in 1999. That summer, Paul Ince, David James, Jason McAteer, Rob Jones, Tony Warner and Steve Harkness were all sold, while Steve McManaman left on a free transfer. Simultaneously, eight new players were signed: Sami Hyypi√§, Dietmar Hamann, St√©phane Henchoz, Vladim√≠r ≈†micer, Sander Westerveld, Titi Camara, Eric Meijer and Djimi Traor√©. Liverpool's training facilities at Melwood were also thoroughly overhauled. The rebuilding continued in 2000 with the signings of Markus Babbel, Nicky Barmby, Pegguy Arphexad, Gr√©gory Vignal, Emile Heskey, Gary McAllister, Igor Bi≈°ƒáan and Christian Ziege, as well as the departures of David Thompson, Phil Babb, Dominic Matteo, Steve Staunton, Brad Friedel and Stig Inge Bj√∏rnebye. The efforts yielded a result in the successful 2000‚Äì01 season, when Liverpool won a cup treble of the League Cup, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup and finished third in the Premier League, hence qualifying for Champions League. In August 2001, Liverpool won the Charity Shield against Manchester United and UEFA Super Cup against Bayern Munich. In October 2001, after falling ill at half-time in the Liverpool's Premier League match with Leeds United, Houllier was rushed to hospital for an emergency operation due to the discovery of a heart condition, an aortic dissection. With the help of caretaker manager Phil Thompson, he guided Liverpool to the second-place finish in the league, at the time their best record in the Premiership. Houllier returned to active management of the club after five months, although significantly weakened by the heart condition.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/11/gerard-houllier- the-man-who-nearly-died-making-liverpool-great-again In the 2002‚Äì03, Liverpool finished in the fifth place in the Premier League, failing to qualify for the following season's UEFA Champions League. Critics blamed Houllier's unsuccessful summer signings in 2002, namely El Hadji Diouf (Lens, ¬£10 million), Salif Diao (Sedan, ¬£5 million) and Bruno Cheyrou (Lille, ¬£4 million), and his failure to make Nicolas Anelka's loan move permanent in favour of signing the ineffective Diouf. Houllier's failure to replace creative talents such as Gary McAllister and Jari Litmanen was also criticized. A lack of success in the following seasons when Liverpool struggled to qualify for the Champions League despite substantial investment in players, with what was perceived as negative one-dimensional tactics and unattractive football, a poor youth policy, his constant mention of \\"turning corners\\" and a lack of support from fans led to Houllier's departure from Liverpool on 24 May 2004. He left by mutual consent with the club and was replaced by Valencia coach Rafael Ben√≠tez. Youth policy Much of Houllier's youth policy was based on bringing in what he regarded as the best that France had to offer. Since he was head of technical development at the FF before he joined Liverpool, he was familiar with young football talents in France. Houllier's last purchase for Liverpool was Djibril Ciss√©, who arrived after Houllier departed for ¬£14 million; Ciss√© was out for most of the first season with a broken leg. However, in the 2005‚Äì06 season, Ciss√© finished as Liverpool's second-highest goalscorer with 19 goals in all competitions (six in Champions League qualifiers, two in the UEFA Super Cup and nine in the Premier League), and scored Liverpool's first goal in their FA Cup victory in May 2006. However, after an alleged bust-up with Liverpool manager Rafael Ben√≠tez, Ciss√© was loaned to Marseille for the 2006‚Äì07 season. On 30 August 2006, Florent Sinama Pongolle, signed by Houllier in 2001, left Liverpool for a season-loan with Recreativo de Huelva. =Lyon= On 29 May 2005, it was announced that Houllier had signed a two-year contract as manager of the champions of Ligue 1, succeeding Paul Le Guen. Olympique Lyonnais had just won their previous fourth successive championship and Houllier was hired to convert this domestic dominance to the European stage. Despite continuing this dominance of Ligue 1, Lyon lost to Milan in the quarter-finals of the 2005‚Äì06 Champions League while they crashed out to the inexperienced Roma in the first knockout round of the 2006‚Äì07 Champions League . Houllier also suffered a cup final defeat (Coupe de la Ligue) to Bordeaux. However, in April 2007, Houllier won his second-straight (Lyon's sixth-straight) Ligue 1 title after Toulouse's loss to Rennes. The 2006‚Äì07 season proved to be his last with the club: on 25 May 2007, he stepped down due to a fractious relationship with outspoken chairman Jean-Michel Aulas, who was frustrated at the club's inability to convert domestic dominance into European success. An official statement on Lyon's website stated that Houllier asked to be released from the last season of his contract and that request was granted by the president. Houllier also said that he needed a break after experiencing two seasons with Lyon. =Aston Villa= On 8 September 2010, it was announced that English Premier League club Aston Villa had appointed Houllier as their new full-time manager, following the resignation of previous boss Martin O'Neill the month before. In his first press conference at the club, it was revealed Houllier had not yet signed a contract and would not take charge of the club until a later date due to commitments with the French Football Federation. Houllier's first match in charge was the League Cup match against Blackburn Rovers on 22 September. Villa won the match 3‚Äì1, coming back from a goal down to progress to the next round of the competition. It was announced on 18 September 2010 that Gary McAllister had agreed to become his assistant manager, with Gordon Cowans also taking a role in Houllier's backroom staff. Two days after the Blackburn match, he signed a three-year contract. However, Houllier's start at the club proved to be a difficult one. The side was hit with a number of injuries to key players such as Gabriel Agbonlahor, Stiliyan Petrov, Nigel Reo-Coker and Emile Heskey, and managed just one win in ten Premier League matches. In November 2010, Houllier signed 37-year-old former Arsenal midfielder Robert Pires on a free transfer in an attempt to aid the club during its injury crisis. By January 2011, Villa had picked up just 21 points from 20 Premier League matches. The club had also been knocked out of the League Cup the previous month by local rivals Birmingham City. On 5 January, Villa were beaten 1‚Äì0 at home by Sunderland; this loss left Villa in 18th position in the league table, the first time they had been in the relegation zone since 2002. During the match, a selection of the home crowd targeted Houllier with chants of \\"you're getting sacked in the morning\\" to vent their frustration at the club's poor run of form. Despite this, Villa directors acted quickly to insist that Houllier's job as manager was safe. In the January transfer Window, Houllier signed Kyle Walker on loan from Tottenham Hotspur in a bid to improve Villa's struggling defence. This signing was followed by the arrival of Jean Makoun from Houllier's former club Lyon, before Sunderland's Darren Bent was brought to Villa Park in a deal that broke the club's previous transfer record. Villa's January transfer window was rounded off with the loan signing of American international midfielder Michael Bradley from Borussia M√∂nchengladbach. In February 2011, Houllier criticised the commitment of Villa defenders Habib Beye and Stephen Warnock. The pair were forced to train with the club's reserve side and were not selected by the Frenchman, even when the club faced even more injury concerns. After the defeat to Sunderland, Villa underwent a revival, winning five and drawing three of their next nine matches, including defeating Manchester City 1‚Äì0 in a run which saw the team climb to 12th. However, Villa were eliminated from the FA Cup by Manchester City via a 3‚Äì0 away loss in early March. Houllier chose to rest a number of key first-team players, a move that was criticised by fans and the media alike. The club's league form also failed to improve. During a team-bonding exercise at a health spa in Leicestershire, Villa defenders James Collins and Richard Dunne were involved in a confrontation with club staff. The players were each fined two weeks' wages. However, Houllier claimed the incident did not affect team morale. On 19 March, Villa faced local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League at Villa Park. Prior to the match, a banner reading, \\"Had enough, Houllier out\\" was unveiled by some supporters in the stadium's Holte End stand. However, this was quickly removed by the club's stewarding staff. The away side won 1‚Äì0 thanks to a goal from Matt Jarvis, claiming their first win against Aston Villa in 31 years. Towards the end of the match, the home fans once again verbally attacked Houllier with chants of \\"we want Houllier out\\" and \\"you don't know what you're doing\\", before giving a chorus of boos at the final whistle. On 20 April, Houllier was admitted to hospital after falling ill in the night. His condition was said to be stable, but he was not able to be at Aston Villa's training session the following day, and was not able to attend their match against Stoke City on 23 April, or any subsequent matches of the 2010‚Äì11 season. Gary McAllister took charge of all first team affairs in his stead. On 1 June, Gerard Houllier stepped down as manager of Aston Villa by mutual consent. In Houllier's only season, Villa finished 9th: they have not finished higher than 15th since his departure. Awards Houllier has been awarded the L√©gion d'honneur for his services to French football, and an honorary OBE for services to British football, along with fellow manager, compatriot and friend Ars√®ne Wenger.

Originally a council of nobles advising a king, boulai evolved according to the constitution of the city: In oligarchies boule positions might have been hereditary, while in democracies members were typically chosen by lot (‚Üí Sortition), and served for one year. Little is known about the workings of many boulai, except in the case of Athens, for which extensive material has survived. Athenian boule The original council of Athens was the Areopagus. It consisted of ex-archons and was aristocratic in character. =Solonian boule= The Athenian boule under Solon heard appeals from the most important decisions of the courts. Those in the poorest class could not serve on the boule of 400. The higher governmental posts, archons (magistrates), were reserved for citizens of the top two income groups.Beck, H., A Companion to Ancient Greek Government, John Wiley & Sons, 2013, p. 199. = Reforms of Cleisthenes = Under the reforms of Cleisthenes enacted in 508/507 BC, the boule was expanded to 500 men, made up of 50 men from each of the ten new tribes also created by Cleisthenes. The 500 men were chosen by lot at the deme level, each deme having been allotted a certain number of places proportional to population. Membership was restricted at this time to the top three of the original four property classes (the Pentacosiomedimni, Hippeis and Zeugitae, but not the Thetes) and to citizens over the age of thirty. The former restriction, though never officially changed, fell out of practice by the middle of the 5th century BC. Members of the boule served for one year and no man could serve more than twice in his life, nor more than once a decade. The leaders of the boule (the prytany) consisted of 50 men chosen from among the 500, and a new 'prytany' was chosen every month. The man in charge of prytany was replaced every day from among the 50 members. The boule met every day except for festival days and ill- omened days. According to Aristotle, Cleisthenes introduced the Bouleutic Oath.Beck, H., A Companion to Ancient Greek Government, John Wiley & Sons, 2013, p. 201. =The boule in the democracy of the late 5th-century BC= After the reforms of Ephialtes and Pericles in the mid-5th century BC, the boule took on many of the administrative and judicial functions of the Areopagus, which retained its traditional right to try homicide cases. It supervised the state's finances, navy, cavalry, sacred matters, building and shipping matters and care for invalids and orphans. Its own members staffed many boards that oversaw the finer points of these many administrative duties. It undertook the examination of public officials both before and after leaving office (most offices lasting one year) to ensure honest accounting and loyalty to the state. It heard some cases of impeachment of public officials for high crimes and mismanagement or serious dereliction of duties.Beck, H., A Companion to Ancient Greek Government, John Wiley & Sons, 2013, p. 201. At some point in the late 5th century, pay was instituted for those serving in the boule; this may have been a way to encourage poorer citizens to volunteer, who would otherwise be reluctant to serve. The boule was considered the cornerstone of the democratic constitution, providing a locus for day-to-day activities and holding together the many disparate administrative functions of the government. Because of the rotation of members, it was assumed that the boule was free from the domination of factions of any kind, although there is some evidence that richer citizens served out of proportion to poorer citizens. This may be due to the heavy investment of time required, time that poorer citizens would not have had to spare.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, pp. 58-59. Boulai in other Greek states =Kingdom of Macedonia= In the Macedonian Kingdom, and later the Macedonian Empire, the body that assisted the king with running the kingdom was called the synedrion, literally translated as \\"The Congress\\". This tradition continued to be in use in the years of Alexander the Great and its members were hereditary. Although not democratic, the members of the Synedrion, including the king were considered equal to one another and had the right of the freedom of speech. =Epirus= The Epirus, which became a federal republic in 231 BC, was ruled by the \\"Synedrion\\", or \\"The Congress\\". The Synedrion was dissolved when the Epirote federation fell apart due to internal upheaval during the Third Macedonian War. =Corinth= The League of Corinth was a federation of Greek states created by king Philip II of Macedon during the winter of 338/337 BC to facilitate his use of unified Greek military forces in his war against Achaemenid Persia. The league guaranteed, among other things, that member states' constitutions in force at the time of joining were guaranteed and that a Synedrion, or congress of representatives, was to meet at Corinth.

It covers the City and County of Philadelphia as well as Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery counties. The diocese was erected by Pope Pius VII on April 8, 1808, from territories of the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Originally the diocese included all of Pennsylvania, Delaware, and seven counties and parts of three counties in New Jersey. The diocese was raised to the dignity of a metropolitan archdiocese on February 12, 1875. The seat of the archbishop is the Cathedral-Basilica of Ss. Peter & Paul. It is also the Metropolitan See of the Ecclesiastical Province of Philadelphia, which includes the suffragan episcopal sees of Allentown, Altoona-Johnstown, Erie, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, and Scranton. The territory of the province is coextensive with the state of Pennsylvania. History of the archdiocese The history of the Catholic Church in the area dates back to William Penn and when Mass was said publicly as early as 1707.A Brief History of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia . Retrieved 2010-03-11. On April 8, 1808, the suffragan dioceses of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Bardstown (moved to Louisville in 1841) were erected by Pope Pius VII from the territory of the Diocese of Baltimore, which was simultaneously raised to the rank of metropolitan archdiocese.See: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore#History. Michael Egan was appointed as the first bishop and was consecrated as a bishop on October 28, 1810, by Archbishop John Carroll. Archdiocesan Pastoral Center In 1868, the dioceses of Harrisburg, Scranton, and Wilmington were erected from the territory of the diocese (the Wilmington diocese also received parts of Maryland and Virginia). Philadelphia was raised to a metropolitan archiepiscopal see on February 12, 1875, with Harrisburg and Scranton among its suffragan dioceses. On January 28, 1961, the five northern counties of Berks, Carbon, Lehigh, Northampton, and Schuylkill were split off from the archdiocese, to create the Diocese of Allentown. By 1969, the archdiocese had grown to 1,351,704 parishioners, 1,096 diocesan priests, 676 priests of religious institutes and 6,622 religious women. In February 2012, the diocese announced the largest reorganization of their elementary and high school education system, with numerous recommended school closings and/or mergers. In a Thursday, August 23, 2012 online news story article about the Archdiocese's schools by Lou Baldwin of Catholic News Service (CNS), it was announced that the Faith in the Future Foundation would assume management of the seventeen archdiocesan high schools and the four special education schools. =Sexual abuse scandals= Beginning in 2005, members of the diocese and its hierarchy have been heavily impacted by sexual abuse scandals. Two grand jury reports, guilty pleas and convictions indicate administrative mishandling of cases and other issues. The sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania, U.S., is a significant episode in the series of Catholic sex abuse cases in the United States, Ireland and elsewhere. The Philadelphia abuses were substantially revealed through a grand jury investigation in 2005. In early 2011, a new grand jury reported extensive new charges of abusive priests active in the archdiocese. In 2012, a guilty plea by priest Edward Avery and the related trial and conviction of Monsignor William Lynn and mistrial on charges against Rev. James J. Brennan followed from the grand jury's investigations. In 2013, Rev. Charles Engelhardt and teacher Bernard Shero were tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. Lynn was the first official to be convicted in the United States of covering up abuses by other priests in his charge and other senior church officials have been extensively criticized for their management of the issue in the archdiocese. On March 12, 2020, a new trial date was official set for Lynn, who was released and ordered to be retried in 2016 after serving 33 months of his sentence, with jury selection to start March 16.https://whyy.org/articles/msgr-lynn-on-trial-again-for-covering-up-clergy- sexual-abuse/ However, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic forced Lynn's retrial to be delayed until January 2021.https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/retrial-of-ex-philly-catholic- official-delayed-over-coronavirus- concerns/2328110/https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2020-03-16/monsignor- in-landmark-church-abuse-case-goes-back-on-trial Following his release from prison in 2016, Lynn was ordered to remain on supervised parole until his retrialhttp://catholicphilly.com/2016/08/news/local-news/msgr-lynn-is-freed- from-prison-retrial-set-for-next-year/ In 2019, it was reported that the 2011 grand jury report also resulted in Lynn being suspended from ministry.https://www.inquirer.com/news/armand-garcia-charged-arrested-priest- sex-abuse-philadelphia- archdiocese-20190305.html#:~:text=Garcia%20is%20the%20first%20priest,William%20J. On May 5, 2020, Archdiocese of Philadelphia announced that it now expected to pay $126 million in reparations.https://www.inquirer.com/business/catholic- archdiocese-philadelphia-sex-abuse-payouts-reparations-fund-20200505.html The archdiocese also said its Independent Reconciliation and Reparations Program, which was established in 2018, has received a total of 615 claims, and had settled 208 of them for $43.8 million as of April 22, 2020. That averages out to about $211,000 per claim, which is in line with what other dioceses have been paying under similar programs. The same day, however, the total number of money which the Archdiocese of Philadelphia expects to pay in sex abuse settlements was soon revised to $130 million by Archbishop of Philadelphia Nelson J. Perez.https://dig.abclocal.go.com/wpvi/pdf/NJP_Global-Letter_AOP- Audited-Financial-Statements-and-IRRP_05-05-2020.pdf On August 14, 2020, it was revealed that the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and its suffragan dioceses of Pittsburgh, Allentown and Scranton were enduring the bulk of 150 new lawsuits filed against all eight Pennsylvania Catholic dioceses.https://www.pennlive.com/news/2020/08/2-years-after-grand-jury- report-on-pa-clergy-sex-abuse-lawsuits-roll-in.html =Firing of Margie Winters for same-sex marriage= In 2015, it was reported that the school's director of religious education, Margie Winters, had been fired from the Waldron Mercy Academy after a parent had reported her directly to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia for marrying her long-term lesbian partner in a civil ceremony in 2007. Winters had been upfront with school administrators at the time of her hiring and was advised to keep a low profile which she says she did. Many parents expressed anger and concern over the school's decision. Principal Nell Stetser justified the decision by arguing that \\"many of us accept life choices that contradict current Church teachings, but to continue as a Catholic school, Waldron Mercy must comply with those teachings.\\" But she called for \\"an open and honest discussion about this and other divisive issues at the intersection of our society and our Church.\\" The Archbishop of Philadelphia, Charles Chaput, called the dismissal \\"common sense.\\" On January 23, 2020, Pope Francis accepted Chaput's letter of resignation and appointed Cleveland Bishop Nelson Perez to succeed Chaput as Archbishop of Philadelphia on February 18, 2020.https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/nelson-perez- philadelphia-archbishop-charles-chaput-1.40925682 After his installation on February 18, 2020, Nelson Perez became the first Hispanic Archbishop of Philadelphia Bishops Charles Joseph Chaput, O.F.M.

Thompson (1950‚Äì1961), appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Charleston in 1989 Churches Educational institutions Circa 1912 there were about 68,000 students in Catholic schools within the archdiocesan territory. This increased to 250,000 in 1961, but the figures decreased after that year. Enrollment was down to 68,000 in 2012. There were about 50,000 students in Catholic schools in the city of Philadelphia in 2000, and this figure decreased to 30,000 in 2010. In that span one Catholic high school and 23 Catholic elementary schools closed or merged, and the proliferation of charter schools in that period meant that the number of students combined in that type of school outnumbered that of the remaining Philadelphia Catholic schools. In 2012 the archdiocese proposed closing or merging 18 schools in Philadelphia and 31 schools outside of Philadelphia; the Philadelphia Inquirer stated this would further weaken Philadelphia's middle class. The proposal would affect 24% and 29% of the senior high and K-8 schools, respectively. =Elementary schools= The first Catholic school established in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia was at St. Mary Parish in Philadelphia during the late eighteenth century. During the nineteenth century, Bishop Kenrick encouraged the establishment of Catholic schools. Subsequently, St. John Neumann (1851‚Äì1860) made the establishment of parish elementary schools a priority and by 1860 there were seventeen parish elementary schools in Philadelphia. Between 1900 and 1930, Catholic elementary schools increased to 124 schools in Philadelphia and 78 schools in the four suburban counties. Between 1945 and 1965, 62 new Catholic elementary schools were established. In 2012, about 25% of the students in Philadelphia Catholic elementary schools were not Catholic. In 2010 South Philadelphia Catholic elementary schools had 2,572 students, a decline by 27% from the 2006 figure. =Special Needs schools= With the foundation of Archbishop Ryan School for Children with Deafness in 1912, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia school system began serving families of children with special needs. St. Katherine Day School and Our Lady of Confidence School, serving students with mental retardation, were opened in 1953 and 1954 respectively, after parent petitions to John Cardinal O'Hara. St. Lucy Day School for Children with Visual Impairment followed in 1955. Queen of the Universe Day Center was added in 1980 to serve students with mental retardation in Bucks County. These five schools are supported by the Catholic Charities Appeal. =High schools within the archdiocese= Diocesan high schools Leadership within the Archdiocese of Philadelphia envisioned a continued comprehensive education for secondary students. The first free Catholic high school in the United States was the \\"Roman Catholic High School of Philadelphia\\", founded for the education of boys in 1890. (It is often referred to as \\"Roman Catholic\\", occasionally as \\"Catholic High\\", and most commonly as \\"Roman\\".) The \\"Catholic Girls High School\\" was founded in 1912. Mary McMichan, one of the school's founders, requested in her last will that the school be renamed in honor of her brother. The school became \\"John W. Hallahan Catholic Girls High School\\" after her death. Both schools are still in existence. Between 1916 and 1927 West Catholic Boys and Girls and Northeast Catholic were opened. Despite the economic hardships of the 1930s and 1940s, seven more diocesan high schools were founded. During a 22-year growth period from 1945 to 1967, fifteen high schools were opened. =Seminaries= *St. Charles Borromeo Seminary *Redemptois Mater Archdiocesan Missionary Seminary =Colleges and universities within the archdiocese= :Note: Each Roman Catholic college and university within the archdiocese is affiliated with a religious institute, rather than the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. *Alvernia University - Philadelphia Center (branch campus), Cheltenham Township (Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis) *Cabrini University, Radnor Township (Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus) *Chestnut Hill College, Philadelphia (Sisters of Saint Joseph) *Gwynedd Mercy University, Lower Gwynedd Township (Sisters of Mercy) *Holy Family University, Philadelphia (Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth) *Immaculata University, East Whiteland Township (Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary) *La Salle University, Philadelphia (Christian Brothers) *Neumann University, Aston Township (Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia) *Rosemont College, Lower Merion Township (Society of the Holy Child Jesus) *Saint Joseph's University, Philadelphia (Jesuits) *Villanova University, Radnor Township (Augustinians)  Catholic Social Services  The Archdiocese has had a foster care agency for more than 100 years.

The net that is used for trawling is called a trawl. The boats that are used for trawling are called trawlers or draggers. Trawlers vary in size from small open boats with as little as 30 hp (22 kW) engines to large factory trawlers with over 10,000 hp (7.5 MW). Trawling can be carried out by one trawler or by two trawlers fishing cooperatively (pair trawling). Trawling can be contrasted with trolling, where baited fishing lines instead of trawls are drawn through the water. Trolling is used both for recreational and commercial fishing whereas trawling is used mainly for commercial fishing. Trawling is also commonly used as a scientific sampling, or survey, method. Bottom vs midwater trawling Trawl catch of myctophids and glass shrimp from the bottom at greater than 200 meters depth Trawling can be divided into bottom trawling and midwater trawling, depending on how high the trawl (net) is in the water column. Bottom trawling is towing the trawl along (benthic trawling) or close to (demersal trawling) the sea floor. Midwater trawling is towing the trawl through free water above the bottom of the ocean or benthic zone. Midwater trawling is also known as pelagic trawling. Midwater trawling catches pelagic fish such as anchovies, shrimp, tuna and mackerel, whereas bottom trawling targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic fish such as cod, halibut and rockfish. The gear itself can vary a great deal. Pelagic trawls are typically much larger than bottom trawls, with very large mesh openings in the net, little or no ground gear, and little or no chaffing gear. Additionally, pelagic trawl doors have different shapes than bottom trawl doors, although doors that can be used with both nets do exist. Net structure Bottom trawling When two boats are used (pair trawling), the horizontal spread of the net is provided by the boats, with one or in the case of pelagic trawling two warps attached to each boat. However, single-boat trawling is more common. Here, the horizontal spread of the net is provided by trawl doors (also known as \\"otter boards\\"). Trawl doors are available in various sizes and shapes and may be specialized to keep in contact with the sea bottom (bottom trawling) or to remain elevated in the water. In all cases, doors essentially act as wings, using a hydrodynamic shape to provide horizontal spread. As with all wings, the towing vessel must go at a certain speed for the doors to remain standing and functional. This speed varies, but is generally in the range of 2.5‚Äì4.0 knots. The vertical opening of a trawl net is created using flotation on the upper edge (\\"floatline\\") and weight on the lower edge (\\"footrope\\") of the net mouth. The configuration of the footrope varies based on the expected bottom shape. The more uneven the bottom, the more robust the footrope configuration must be to prevent net damage. This is used to catch shrimp, shellfish, cod, scallops and many others. Trawls are funnel-shaped nets that have a closed-off tail where the fish are collected and is open on the top end as the mouth. Trawl nets can also be modified, such as changing mesh size, to help with marine research of ocean bottoms. Environmental effects Nets for trawling in surface waters and for trawling in deep water and over the bottom. Note the \\"tangles\\" with ensnared marine life Although trawling today is heavily regulated in some nations, it remains the target of many protests by environmentalists. Environmental concerns related to trawling refer to two areas: the lack of selectivity and the physical damage which the trawl does to the seabed. =Selectivity= Since the practice of trawling started (around the 15th century), there have been concerns over trawling's lack of selectivity. Trawls may be non-selective, sweeping both marketable and undesirable fish and fish of both legal and illegal size. Any part of the catch which cannot be used is considered by-catch, some of which is killed accidentally by the trawling process. By-catch commonly includes valued species such as dolphins, sea turtles, and sharks, and may also include sublegal or immature individuals of the targeted species. Many studies have documented large volumes of by-catch that are discarded. For example, researchers conducting a three-year study in the Clarence River found that an estimated 177 tons of by-catch (including 77 different species) were discarded each year.Liggins, G.W., Kennelly, S.J., 1996. By-catch from prawn trawling in the Clarence River estuary, New South Wales, Australia. Fish. Res. 25, 347-367. Size selectivity is controlled by the mesh size of the \\"cod-end\\"‚Äîthe part of the trawl where fish are retained. Fishermen complain that mesh sizes which allow undersized fish to escape also allow some legally catchable fish to escape. There are a number of \\"fixes\\", such as tying a rope around the \\"cod-end\\" to prevent the mesh from opening fully, which have been developed to work around technical regulation of size selectivity. One problem is when the mesh gets pulled into narrow diamond shapes (rhombuses) instead of squares. The capture of undesirable species is a recognized problem with all fishing methods and unites environmentalists, who do not want to see fish killed needlessly, and fishermen, who do not want to waste their time sorting marketable fish from their catch. A number of methods to minimize this have been developed for use in trawling. Bycatch reduction grids or square mesh panels of net can be fitted to parts of the trawl, allowing certain species to escape while retaining others. Studies have suggested that shrimp trawling is responsible for the highest rate of by-catch.Alverson D L, Freeberg M K, Murawski S A and Pope J G. (1994) A global assessment of fisheries bycatch and discards. FAO Fisheries Technical Paper No 339 Rome, FAO 1994. =Environmental damage = alt=Photo of partially submerged net, with distant snow-covered mountain range below clear sky in background Trawling is controversial because of its environmental impacts. Because bottom trawling involves towing heavy fishing gear over the seabed, it can cause large-scale destruction on the ocean bottom, including coral shattering, damage to habitats and removal of seaweed. The primary sources of impact are the doors, which can weigh several tonnes and create furrows if dragged along the bottom, and the footrope configuration, which usually remains in contact with the bottom across the entire lower edge of the net. Depending on the configuration, the footrope may turn over large rocks or boulders, possibly dragging them along with the net, disturb or damage sessile organisms or rework and re-suspend bottom sediments. These impacts result in decreases in species diversity and ecological changes towards more opportunistic organisms. The destruction has been likened to clear-cutting in forests. The primary dispute over trawling concerns the magnitude and duration of these impacts. Opponents argue that they are widespread, intense and long-lasting. Defenders maintain that impact is mostly limited and of low intensity compared to natural events. However, most areas with significant natural sea bottom disturbance events are in relatively shallow water. In mid to deep waters, bottoms trawlers are the only significant area-wide events. Bottom trawling on soft bottoms also stirs up bottom sediments and loading suspended solids into the water column. One bottom trawler can put more than 10 times the amount of suspended solids pollution per hour into the water column than all the suspended solids pollution from all the sewerage, industrial, river and dredge disposal operations in Southern California combined. These turbidity plumes can be seen on Google Earth in areas where they have high resolution offshore photos (see Bottom trawling). When the turbidity plumes from bottom trawlers are below a thermocline, the surface may not be impacted, but less visible impacts can still occur, such as persistent organic pollutant transfer into the pelagic food chain. As a result of these processes, a vast array of species are threatened around the world. In particular, trawling can directly kill coral reefs by breaking them up and burying them in sediments. In addition, trawling can kill corals indirectly by wounding coral tissue, leaving the reefs vulnerable to infection. The net effect of fishing practices on global coral reef populations is suggested by many scientists to be alarmingly high.Roberts S, Hirshfield M. (2004) Deep Sea Corals: Out of Sight, But No Longer Out of Mind . Oceania. In Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, April 2004. Published research has shown that benthic trawling destroys the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa, an important habitat for many deep-sea organisms.Fossa J H, Mortensen P B and Furevik D M. (2002) The deep water coral Lophelia pertusa in Norwegian waters: distribution and fishery impacts . Hydrobiologia 471: 1-12, 2002. Midwater (pelagic) trawling is a much \\"cleaner\\" method of fishing, in that the catch usually consists of just one species and does not physically damage the sea bottom. However, environmental groups have raised concerns that this fishing practice may be responsible for significant volumes of by-catch, particularly cetaceans (dolphins, porpoises, and whales).Ross A, Isaac S. (2004) The net effect? A review of cetacean bycatch in pelagic trawls and other fisheries in the north-east Atlantic. London, UK: Greenpeace Environmental Trust. Regulation In light of the environmental concerns surrounding trawling, many governments have debated policies that would regulate the practice. Anti-trawling devices Besides the aforementioned environmental objections, trawlers also run afoul of international borders and exclusive economic zones. Sometimes more local fishermen look at particular waters as theirs even when there is no legal requirement being violated. So some environmental groups, fishermen, and even governments have deployed anti-trawling devices. Other uses of the word \\"trawl\\" The noun \\"trawl\\" has many possibly confusing meanings in commercial fisheries. For example, two or more lobster pots that are fished together may be referred to as a trawl. In some older usages \\"trawling\\" meant \\"long-line fishing\\"; that usage occurs in Rudyard Kipling's book Captains Courageous. (This use is perhaps confused with trolling, where a baited line is trailed behind a boat. Troll also has several meanings.) The word \\"trawling\\" has come to be used in a number of non-fishing contexts, usually meaning indiscriminate collection with the intent of picking out the useful bits. For instance, in law enforcement it may refer to collecting large volumes of telephone call records hoping to find calls made by suspects. It also occurs frequently in reference to research methods, where it means searching through written sources for relevant information.

Collier, publisher of Collier's Weekly magazine, was an air sports pioneer and president of the Aero Club of America. In 1910, he commissioned Baltimore sculptor Ernest Wise Keyser to make the Aero Club of America Trophy. First awarded in 1911 to Glenn H. Curtiss for his successful development of the hydro-aeroplane. Collier owned a Wright Model B biplane which he purchased in 1911. Collier presented his namesake trophy several times before his death in 1918; after his World War I service. In 1922, when the Aero Club dissolved, the award was taken over by the National Aeronautic Association (NAA) and it was unofficially renamed the Robert J. Collier Trophy, which became official in 1944. The award is presented once a year by the NAA president, with the trophy on permanent display at the U.S. National Air and Space Museum. As such, the trophy was in the custody of its 1969 co-recipient Michael Collins during his directorship of the museum. The trophy was stolen briefly in 1978, but was recovered.http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_1429 The thieves left it at Fort Foote park and it was recovered 26 hours from the time it went missing.

Assar Gabrielsson, Volvo's president and founder, got the idea for the car when he saw a Chevrolet Corvette in the United States and wanted to make something similar. He asked Bill Tritt of Glasspar, an American boatbuilder in Santa Ana, California, to design and tool a fibreglass/reinforced polyester body, which was later produced in Sweden. Glasspar was a pioneer in building fiberglass auto bodies from 1951 to 1957. Erik Quistgaard was appointed as development team leader. The car was built on a tubular-steel chassis and used the Volvo PV444's 1,414 cubic centimetre engine producing . The engines (B14A and B16B ) were fitted with twin SU carburetors, driving through a three-speed manual gearbox. Many other parts were taken also from the Volvo PV444. Demand was low, and the build quality was not up to Volvo standards. Gunnar Engellau, who replaced Gabrielsson as president in 1956, took one for a drive on a holiday weekend and was dissatisfied enough that on returning to his office the following week cancelled the remaining production. \\"I thought it would fall apart!\\" is the legendary quote. The total \\"Volvo Sport\\" production was sixty-eight cars, plus four or five prototypes. Forty-four were built in 1956, mostly for the Swedish market, and most still survive. The bulk of 1957's production went to the U.S. and elsewhere, and fewer of these are still in existence. However the development of the P-1900 led to the tuning of the B-16 engine, which was later put into the PV 444 series, making this car powerful enough to enter the American market.

Bacteria have restriction enzymes, also called restriction endonucleases, which cleave double stranded DNA at specific points into fragments, which are then degraded further by other endonucleases. This prevents infection by effectively destroying the foreign DNA introduced by an infectious agent (such as a bacteriophage). Approximately one-quarter of known bacteria possess RM systems and of those about one-half have more than one type of system. As the sequences recognized by the restriction enzymes are very short, the bacterium itself will almost certainly contain some within its genome. In order to prevent destruction of its own DNA by the restriction enzymes, methyl groups are added. These modifications must not interfere with the DNA base-pairing, and therefore, usually only a few specific bases are modified on each strand. Endonucleases cleave internal/non-terminal phosphodiester bonds. They do so only after recognising specific sequences in DNA which are usually 4-6 base pairs long, and often palindromic. History The RM system was first discovered by Salvatore Luria and Mary Human in 1952 and 1953. They found that bacteriophage growing within an infected bacterium could be modified, so that upon their release and re-infection of a related bacterium the bacteriophage‚Äôs growth is restricted (inhibited) (also described by Luria in his autobiography on pages 45 and 99 in 1984).Salvator E Luria. A Slot Machine, A Broken Test Tube: An Autobiography. Harper & Row, New York: 1984. Pp. 228. (USA and Canada) In 1953, Jean Weigle and Giuseppe Bertani reported similar examples of host-controlled modification using different bacteriophage system. Later work by Daisy Roulland-Dussoix and Werner Arber in 1962 and many other subsequent workers led to the understanding that restriction was due to attack and breakdown of the modified bacteriophage‚Äôs DNA by specific enzymes of the recipient bacteria. Further work by Hamilton O. Smith isolated HinDII, the first of the class of enzymes now known as restriction enzymes, while Daniel Nathans showed that it can be used for restriction mapping. When these enzymes were isolated in the laboratory they could be used for controlled manipulation of DNA, thus providing the foundation for the development of genetic engineering. Werner Arber, Daniel Nathans, and Hamilton Smith were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1978 for their work on restriction-modification. Types There are four categories of restriction modification systems: type I, type II, type III and type IV, all with restriction enzyme activity and a methylase activity (except for type IV that has no methylase activity). They were named in the order of discovery, although the type II system is the most common. Type I systems are the most complex, consisting of three polypeptides: R (restriction), M (modification), and S (specificity). The resulting complex can both cleave and methylate DNA. Both reactions require ATP, and cleavage often occurs a considerable distance from the recognition site. The S subunit determines the specificity of both restriction and methylation. Cleavage occurs at variable distances from the recognition sequence, so discrete bands are not easily visualized by gel electrophoresis. Type II systems are the simplest and the most prevalent. Instead of working as a complex, the methyltransferase and endonuclease are encoded as two separate proteins and act independently (there is no specificity protein). Both proteins recognize the same recognition site, and therefore compete for activity. The methyltransferase acts as a monomer, methylating the duplex one strand at a time. The endonuclease acts as a homodimer, which facilitates the cleavage of both strands. Cleavage occurs at a defined position close to or within the recognition sequence, thus producing discrete fragments during gel electrophoresis. For this reason, Type II systems are used in labs for DNA analysis and gene cloning. Type III systems have R (res) and M (mod) proteins that form a complex of modification and cleavage. The M protein, however, can methylate on its own. Methylation also only occurs on one strand of the DNA unlike most other known mechanisms. The heterodimer formed by the R and M proteins competes with itself by modifying and restricting the same reaction. This results in incomplete digestion. Type IV systems are not true RM systems because they only contain a restriction enzyme and not a methylase. Unlike the other types, type IV restriction enzymes recognize and cut only modified DNA. Function Neisseria meningitidis has multiple type II restriction endonuclease systems that are employed in natural genetic transformation. Natural genetic transformation is a process by which a recipient bacterial cell can take up DNA from a neighboring donor bacterial cell and integrate this DNA into its genome by recombination. Although early work on restriction modification systems focused on the benefit to bacteria of protecting themselves against invading bacteriophage DNA or other foreign DNA, it is now known that these systems can also be used to restrict DNA introduced by natural transformation from other members of the same, or related species. In the pathogenic bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (meningococci), competence for transformation is a highly evolved and complex process where multiple proteins at the bacterial surface, in the membranes and in the cytoplasm interact with the incoming transforming DNA. Restriction-modification systems are abundant in the genus Neisseria. N. meningitidis has multiple type II restriction endonuclease systems. The restriction modification systems in N. meningitidis vary in specificity between different clades. This specificity provides an efficient barrier against DNA exchange between clades. Luria, on page 99 of his autobiography, referred to such a restriction behavior as ‚Äúan extreme instance of unfriendliness.‚Äù Restriction-modification appears to be a major driver of sexual isolation and speciation in the meningococci. Caugant and Maiden suggested that restriction-modification systems in meningococci may act to allow genetic exchange among very close relatives while reducing (but not completely preventing) genetic exchange among meningococci belonging to different clonal complexes and related species. RM systems can also act as selfish genetic elements, forcing their maintenance on the cell through postsegregational cell killing. Some viruses have evolved ways of subverting the restriction modification system, usually by modifying their own DNA, by adding methyl or glycosyl groups to it, thus blocking the restriction enzymes. Other viruses, such as bacteriophages T3 and T7, encode proteins that inhibit the restriction enzymes. To counteract these viruses, some bacteria have evolved restriction systems which only recognize and cleave modified DNA, but do not act upon the host's unmodified DNA. Some prokaryotes have developed multiple types of restriction modification systems. R-M systems are more abundant in promiscuous species, wherein they establish preferential paths of genetic exchange within and between lineages with cognate R-M systems. Because the repertoire and/or specificity of R-M systems in bacterial lineages vary quickly, the preferential fluxes of genetic transfer within species are expected to constantly change, producing time-dependent networks of gene transfer. Applications =Molecular biology= (a) Cloning: RM systems can be cloned into plasmids and selected because of the resistance provided by the methylation enzyme. Once the plasmid begins to replicate, the methylation enzyme will be produced and methylate the plasmid DNA, protecting it from a specific restriction enzyme. (b) Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms: Restriction enzymes are also used to analyse the composition of DNA in regard to presence or absence of mutations that affect the specificity of the REase cleavage specificity. When wild-type and mutants are analysed by digestion with different REases, the gel-electrophoretic products vary in length, largely because mutant genes will not be cleaved in a similar pattern as wild- type for presence of mutations that render the REases nonb-specific to the mutant sequence. =Gene therapy= The bacteria R-M system has been proposed as a model for devising human anti-viral gene or genomic vaccines and therapies since the RM system serves an innate defense-role in bacteria by restricting tropism of bacteriophages. Research is on REases and ZFN that can cleave the DNA of various human viruses, including HSV-2, high-risk HPVs and HIV-1, with the ultimate goal of inducing target mutagenesis and aberrations of human-infecting viruses. The human genome already contains remnants of retroviral genomes that have been inactivated and harnessed for self-gain. Indeed, the mechanisms for silencing active L1 genomic retroelements by the three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) and excision repair cross complementing 1(ERCC) appear to mimic the action of RM-systems in bacteria, and the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) that follows the use of ZFN without a repair template. A major advance is the creation of artificial restriction enzymes created by linking the FokI DNA cleavage domain with an array of DNA binding proteins or zinc finger arrays, denoted now as zinc finger nucleases (ZFN). ZFNs are a powerful tool for host genome editing due to their enhanced sequence specificity. ZFN work in pairs, their dimerization being mediated in- situ through the FoKI domain. Each zinc finger array (ZFA) is capable of recognizing 9-12 base-pairs, making for 18-24 for the pair. A 5-7 bp spacer between the cleavage sites further enhances the specificity of ZFN, making them a safe and more precise tool that can be applied in humans. A recent Phase I clinical trial of ZFN for the targeted abolition of the CCR5 co- receptor for HIV-1 has been undertaken.  Their relation with mobile genetic elements (MGEs)  R-M systems are major players in the co-evolutionary interaction between mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and their hosts. Genes encoding R-M systems have been reported to move between prokaryotic genomes within MGEs such as plasmids, prophages, insertion sequences/transposons, integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) and integrons. However, it was recently found that there are relatively few R-M systems in plasmids, some in prophages, and practically none in phages. On the other hand, all these MGEs encode a large number of solitary R-M genes, notably MTases. In light of this, it is likely that R-M mobility may be less dependent on MGEs and more dependent, for example, on the existence of small genomic integration hotspots. It is also possible that R-M systems frequently exploit other mechanisms such as natural transformation, vesicles, nanotubes, gene transfer agents or generalized transduction in order to move between genomes.

The archdiocese comprises the City of Baltimore and 9 of Maryland's 23 counties in the central and western portions of the state: Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Harford, Howard, and Washington. The archdiocese is the metropolitan see of the larger regional Ecclesiastical Province of Baltimore. The Archdiocese of Washington was originally part of the Archdiocese of Baltimore. The Archdiocese of Baltimore is the oldest diocese in the United States whose see city was entirely within the nation's boundaries when the United States declared its independence in 1776. The Holy See granted the Archbishop of Baltimore the right of precedence in the nation at liturgies, meetings, and Plenary Councils on August 15, 1859. Although the Archdiocese of Baltimore does not enjoy \\"primatial\\" status, it is the premier episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States of America, as \\"prerogative of place\\". Within the archdiocese are 518,000 Catholics, 145 parishes, 545 priests (244 diocesan priests, 196 priests resident in diocese), 159 permanent deacons, 55 brothers, 803 sisters, 205 lay extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, five hospitals, 28 aged homes, 7 diocesan/parish high schools, 13 private high schools, and 4 Catholic colleges/universities. The Archdiocese of Baltimore has two major seminaries: St. Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore and Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg. This archdiocese was featured in the Netflix documentary The Keepers exposing the sexual abuse history at Archbishop Keough High School and the murder of Sister Catherine Cesnik in 1969. It was revealed in late 2016 that the Archdiocese of Baltimore had paid off numerous settlements since 2011 for abuse victims. History Before and during the American Revolutionary War, the Catholics in Great Britain's thirteen colonies in America were under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the bishop of the Apostolic Vicariate of the London District, in England. After the Treaty of Paris, signed September 3, 1783, ended the war, Maryland clergy delivered a petition to the Holy See, on November 6, 1783, for permission for the missionaries in the United States to nominate a superior who would have some of the powers of a bishop. In response, Pope Pius VI on June 6, 1784, confirmed Father John Carroll, who had been selected by his brother priests, as Superior of the Missions in the newly independent thirteen United States of North America, with power to give the sacrament of confirmation. This act established a hierarchy in the United States and removed the Catholic Church in the U.S. from the authority of the Vicar Apostolic of the London District. The Holy See then established the Apostolic Prefecture of the United States on November 26, 1784. Because Maryland was one of the few regions of the colonial United States with a substantial Roman Catholic population, the apostolic prefecture was elevated to become the Diocese of Baltimore‚Äîthe first diocese in the United States‚Äîon November 6, 1789. In 1790, Father Carroll traveled to England where he was ordained and consecrated as a bishop in Lulworth Castle in Dorset, by Bishop Charles Walmesley, O.S.B. The first American-born Catholic priest, William Matthews, was ordained by Carroll at St. Peter's Pro-Cathedral in the Diocese of Baltimore in 1800. On April 8, 1808, Pope Pius VII erected the suffragan dioceses of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Bardstown in Bardstown, Kentucky, which moved in 1841 to the larger city of Louisville, from the territory of the Diocese of Baltimore and simultaneously raised it to the rank of metropolitan archdiocese, thereby making it the \\"Archdiocese of Baltimore\\". The newly established \\"Province of Baltimore\\"‚Äîwhose metropolitan was the Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Baltimore‚Äîcomprised all of the states and territories of the nation. The archdiocese again lost territory in following decades with the creation of the Diocese of Richmond (Virginia) on July 11, 1820; and the Diocese of Wilmington (Delaware) on March 3, 1868. In between, a part of the District of Columbia had been retroceded to Virginia in 1846, so in 1850 that new piece of Virginia was transferred to the Diocese of Richmond. On July 22, 1939, the City of Washington was erected as a separate archdiocese.Most Rev. Michael J. Curley . Archdiocese of Baltimore. Retrieved on 2016-11-19. The archbishop of Baltimore, Michael J. Curley, was simultaneously named the first archbishop of the new Archdiocese of Washington (D.C.) and continued to administer the two archdioceses as a single unit -- in persona episcopi.Archbishops of the Modern Era (1851 - 2012) . Archdiocese of Baltimore. Retrieved on 2016-11-19. The see was temporarily renamed the Archdiocese of Baltimore-Washington, in recognition of the nation's capital. Eight years later, on November 15, 1947, Patrick A. O'Boyle was appointed the second archbishop -- and first residential archbishop -- of the Archdiocese of Washington, which consequently began to function as a separate diocese. Therefore, the territory of the \\"new\\" archdiocese -- consisting of the District of Columbia and the two Washington suburban and three southern counties of Maryland -- were permanently separated from the Archdiocese of Baltimore, which was thus reduced to its current extent and resumed its previous name. From 1808 until 1847, Baltimore was the only archdiocese in the United States and therefore the entire country was one ecclesiastical province. As the nation's population grew and waves of Catholic immigrants arrived, the Holy See continued to erect new dioceses and elevate certain others to the status of metropolitan archdioceses, which simultaneously became metropolitan sees of new ecclesiastical provinces. Thus, the Province of Baltimore gradually became smaller and smaller. In 1846, the Diocese of Oregon City, now Portland, Oregon was raised to an archdiocese. Following in 1847, the then Diocese of Saint Louis was elevated to an archdiocese and metropolitan see of the new Province of Saint Louis. Also in 1850, the Diocese of New York was raised to an archdiocese. In 1875, the dioceses of Boston and Philadelphia were likewise elevated. The archdiocese began to publish its diocesan newspaper, The Baltimore Catholic Review since 1913 as the successor to the earlier diocesan publication The Catholic Mirror, published 1833 to 1908. The name has since been shortened to The Catholic Review. In 2012, it changed from weekly to biweekly issues and in December 2015, it transformed again to a monthly magazine. =Plenary Councils of Baltimore= The Plenary Councils of Baltimore were three national meetings of Catholic bishops in the United States in 1852, 1866 and 1884 in Baltimore, Maryland. * First Plenary Council of Baltimore (1852): among the decrees were one that required immigrant priests to provide a letter of reference from their previous bishops, and a requirement that marriage banns be published. * Second Plenary Council of Baltimore (1866): promulgated the custom of the Churching of women, the blessing of women after giving birth, focusing on blessing and thanksgiving; and set the age for first communion at ten years of age, as well as, handling other ecclesiastical matters. * Third Plenary Council of Baltimore (1884): was presided over by Archbishop of Baltimore James Gibbons as Apostolic Delegate. It set six Holy Days of Obligation, and appointed a commission to draft a catechism, and addressed other subjects. = Notable people = * St. Elizabeth Ann Seton - Seton founded the first American congregation of religious sisters, the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph, in Emmitsburg, Maryland, in 1809. A year later, she opened the first free Catholic school for girls in the United States. Many trace the modern Catholic school system in America to Seton's Emmitsburg institution. In 1975, Seton became the first American-born person to be canonized a saint. * Mother Mary Lange - Born in Cuba, Elizabeth Clarisse Lange migrated to United States in the early 19th century. She eventually settled in Baltimore and opened a free school in her home where she educated black children who faced intense prejudice and were denied access to most schools. In 1828, Lange founded the Oblate Sisters of Providence, the first sustained religious order for women of African descent in the United States. She also opened what would later become St. Frances Academy - the first Catholic School for African-American children in the U.S. In 1991, the Catholic Church opened a cause of sainthood for Lange, naming her a \\"servant of God.\\" =Sexual abuse cases= In 2016 the Archdiocese of Baltimore confirmed that settlements had been paid to past students of Seton Keough High School who were sexual abused by Father A. Joseph Maskell, a priest at the school from 1967 to 1975. In January 1970, a popular English and drama teacher at Archbishop Keough, Sister Cathy Cesnik, was found murdered in the outskirts of the city of Baltimore. Her murder was never solved and is the topic of a true crime documentary The Keepers that was released on Netflix on May 19, 2017. Maskell, who died in 2001, was long fingered as a lead suspect in her murder. Though never formally charged, the Archdiocese of Baltimore settled with 16 of Maskell's possible victims for a total of $472,000 by 2017. A report released by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro on August 14, 2018, singled out Bishop and future Cardinal William Keeler for transferring abusive Pennsylvania priest Father Arthur Long from the Diocese of Harrisburg to the Archdiocese of Baltimore. On August 15, 2018, one day after the Pennsylvania report was published, the Archdiocese of Baltimore announced that a pre K-8 Catholic school scheduled to be opened in 2018 and named for Keeler would no longer bear his name. Despite a denial from Long's religious order and the Archdiocese of Baltimore that Long abused children while serving the Archdiocese of Baltimore, a leaked church memo written in 1995, the year Long was removed from ministry, revealed that accusations of \\"inappropriate behavior\\" had surfaced against Long in 1991 and 1992 during his time in the Archdiocese of Baltimore, and the Pennsylvania report noted that Keeler was notified of accusations of Long sexually abusing children when he was serving as Bishop of Harrisburg in 1987. Long died in 2004. In March 2019, Archbishop Lori banned accused former Archdiocese of Baltimore Auxiliary Bishop Gordon Bennett from practicing any form of ministry in the Archdiocese of Baltimore and the suffragan Diocese of Wheeling‚ÄìCharleston.https://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2019/03/11/two-former- bishops-have-ministry-restricted-over-abuse-claims/ In April 2019, the Archdiocese of Baltimore added the names of 23 deceased clergy to a list of accused clergy which the Archdiocese published in 2002. Long, a Jesuit, was among those added to the list. Episcopate =\\"Prerogative of Place\\"= The Archdiocese of Baltimore is led by the Archbishop of Baltimore and a corps of auxiliary bishops who assist in the administration of the archdiocese as part of a larger curia. Sixteen men have served as Archbishop of Baltimore; , the archbishop is William E. Lori. In 1858, the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda Fide), with the approval of Pope Pius IX, conferred \\"Prerogative of Place\\" on the Archdiocese of Baltimore. This decree gives the archbishop of Baltimore precedence over all other archbishops of the United States (but not cardinals) in councils, gatherings, and meetings of whatever kind of the hierarchy (in conciliis, coetibus et comitiis quibuscumque), regardless of the seniority of other archbishops in promotion or ordination. =Co-cathedrals= The archbishop is concurrently the pastor of the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in Homeland in north Baltimore and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (old Baltimore Cathedral). The older cathedral is located on Cathedral Hill above downtown, near the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood. Both are called co-cathedrals. The archbishop appoints a rector for each of the co-cathedrals. The basilica, built in 1806‚Äì1821, is the first cathedral constructed in the United States (within its boundaries at the time). It is considered the mother church of the United States. During the time from the first bishop John Carroll's installation in 1790 to the dedication of the old Baltimore Cathedral in 1821, the bishop's throne (cathedra) was at St. Peter's Church (first parish in the diocese, founded 1770). It was located two blocks south on the northwestern corner of North Charles Street and West Saratoga Street, serving as the pro-cathedral with its attached rectory, school and surrounding cemetery. Old St. Peter's was across the street from the \\"Mother Church of the Anglican Church\\" in Baltimore, Old St. Paul's Church, with four successive buildings at the site beginning in 1730 at the southeast corner of Charles and Saratoga streets in downtown overlooking the harbor. St. Peter's Roman Catholic parish was razed in 1841. The Archdiocese of Baltimore is one of only five United States dioceses that have two churches serving as cathedrals in the same city, the others being the Diocese of Honolulu; the Diocese of Burlington, the Diocese of Brooklyn and the Archdiocese of Anchorage, Alaska.Co-cathedral Other dioceses with two cathedrals have them in separate cities. Bishops John Carroll lays the cornerstone in 1806 for the Cathedral of the Assumption on Cathedral Hill in Baltimore, first Roman Catholic cathedral to be constructed in the United States. =Archbishops of Baltimore= The list of archbishops and their terms of service: # John Carroll (1784‚Äì1815), raised from Bishop to Archbishop in 1808 # Leonard Neale (1815‚Äì1817; coadjutor 1795-1815) # Ambrose Mar√©chal (1817‚Äì1828) # James Whitfield (1828‚Äì1834; coadjutor 1828) # Samuel Eccleston (1834‚Äì1851; coadjutor 1834) # Francis Patrick Kenrick (1851‚Äì1863) # Martin John Spalding (1864‚Äì1872) # James Roosevelt Bayley (1872‚Äì1877) # James Gibbons (1877‚Äì1921) (Cardinal in 1886) # Michael Joseph Curley (1921‚Äì1947) # Francis Patrick Keough (1947‚Äì1961) # Lawrence Shehan (1961‚Äì1974; coadjutor 1961) (Cardinal in 1965) # William Donald Borders (1974‚Äì1989) # William Henry Keeler (1989‚Äì2007) (Cardinal in 1994) # Edwin Frederick O'Brien (2007‚Äì2011), appointed Grand Master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre (Cardinal in 2012) # William Edward Lori (2012‚Äìpresent) =Auxiliary bishops= * Alfred Allen Paul Curtis (1897‚Äì1908), previously appointed Bishop of Wilmington * Owen Patrick Bernard Corrigan (1908‚Äì1929) * Thomas Joseph Shahan (1914‚Äì1932) * John Michael McNamara (1927‚Äì1947), appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Washington * Lawrence Joseph Shehan (1945‚Äì1953), appointed Bishop of Bridgeport (later returned here as Coadjutor Archbishop and Archbishop); future Cardinal * Jerome Aloysius Daugherty Sebastian (1953‚Äì1960) * Thomas Austin Murphy (1962‚Äì1984) * Thomas Joseph Mardaga (1966‚Äì1968), appointed Bishop of Wilmington * Francis Joseph Gossman (1968‚Äì1975), appointed Bishop of Raleigh * Philip Francis Murphy (1976‚Äì1999) * James Francis Stafford (1976‚Äì1982), appointed Bishop of Memphis and later Archbishop of Denver, President of the Pontifical Council for the Laity, and Major Penitentiary of the Apostolic Penitentiary (elevated to Cardinal in 1998) * William Clifford Newman (1984‚Äì2003) * John Ricard (1984‚Äì1997), appointed Bishop of Pensacola-Tallahassee * Gordon Dunlap Bennett (1997‚Äì2004), appointed Bishop of Mandeville * William Francis Malooly (2000‚Äì2008), appointed Bishop of Wilmington * Mitchell T.

The present episcopal see of the Diocese, St. Peter's Cathedral, was built in a French Gothic Revival style from 1880 to 1885. It was raised to the status of a minor basilica by Pope John XXIII in December, 1961.  Statistics and Extent  The Diocese covers the counties of Middlesex, Elgin, Norfolk, Oxford, Perth, Huron, Lambton, Kent and Essex. As of 2020, it pastorally served 444,310 Catholics (22.8% of 1,944,182 total) on 21,349 km¬≤ in 130 parishes and 1 mission with 136 priests (101 diocesan, 35 religious), 73 deacons, 474 lay religious (1 brother, 473 sisters) and 11 seminarians. The Diocese also runs St. Peter's Seminary, which is now affiliated with the University of Western Ontario.  History  * The Diocese of London was created on February 21, 1856 by Pope Pius IX, on territory carved out of the then Roman Catholic Diocese of Toronto (now a Metropolitan Archdiocese), along with the Diocese of Hamilton, Ontario. Pierre-Adolphe Pinsonnault was named the first Bishop of London on May 18 of that year. * On 1859.02.02 it was renamed as Diocese of Sandwich / Sandvicen(sis) (Latin), as its first Bishop Pinsoneault moved the seat of the diocese to Sandwich, on the Detroit River * On 1869.11.15 it was renamed back as Diocese of London / Londonen(sis) (Latin), the diocesan see having been returned under second Bishop John Walsh. * On 2020.05.21 an Ontario appeals court dismissed a bid by the Diocese of London to drop a lawsuit filed by Irene Deschenes, who claimed that notorious predator priest Charles Henry Sylvestre sexually abused her when she was a minor between 1970 and 1973.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-catholic-diocese-loses- appeal-in-child-sexual-abuse-case-1.5578775 Deschenes first began legal action against the Diocese of London in 1996. Sylvestre pled guilty in August 2006 to sexually abusing 47 females, whose ages ranged between 9 and 14, between 1952 and 1989 Local newspapers documented the lives of many of the women who refused the publication ban and spoke out about their abuse. He was given a three-year sentence in October 2006 and died January 22, 2007, of natural causes after only three months in prison. The case was documented by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation new programme The Fifth Estate.

It comprises Santa Clara County, and is led by a bishop. Its patron saints are Saint Joseph and Saint Clare of Assisi. The diocese is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of San Francisco. Its fellow suffragans include the Dioceses of Honolulu, Las Vegas, Oakland, Reno, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, Santa Rosa and Stockton. The Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph in Downtown San Jose is the cathedral church of the diocese. The diocesan offices are located at 1150 North First Street. The diocese serves over 600,000 Catholics in 52 parishes and missions, three university campus ministries, and 38 schools. History The Roman Catholic Church in present- day Santa Clara County dates to the founding of Mission Santa Clara de As√≠s (a Spanish mission) in 1777, during the era of the Provincias Internas of New Spain. Originally a part of the Diocese of Sonora in Mexico, in 1840 San Jose and the rest of the Californias became part of the Diocese of Alta and Baja California, headquartered in Santa Barbara. In 1850, two years after the Mexican Cession, the Diocese of Alta and Baja California was split between the American and Mexican territories, and San Jose became a part of the Diocese of Monterey. In 1853, the northern half of the county became part of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, while the areas around Gilroy and Morgan Hill remained in the Diocese of Monterey. In 1922 the American Catholic Church decided to use county boundaries for dioceses, and the southern half of the county was transferred to the Archdiocese of San Francisco. Pope John Paul II granted the See of San Jose independence on January 27, 1981; the diocese was canonically erected later that year by archbishops Pio Laghi, Apostolic Delegate to the United States, and John R. Quinn, Metropolitan Archbishop of San Francisco, on March 18, the vigil of the feast of Saint Joseph. The first Bishop of San Jose was Pierre DuMaine, and the first cathedral of the diocese was Saint Patrick Proto-Cathedral Parish.

Phoenix, AZ. 2nd Ed. (1993). Pg. 48. The first four circuits deal with life on Earth, and survival of the species. The last four circuits are post-terrestrial, and deal with the evolution of the species, altered states of consciousness, enlightenment, mystical experiences, psychedelic states of mind, and psychic abilities. The proposal suggests that these altered states of consciousness are recently realized, but not widely utilized. Leary describes the first four as \\"larval circuits\\", necessary for surviving and functioning in a terrestrial human society, and proposed that the post terrestrial circuits will be useful for future humans who, through a predetermined script, continue to act on their urge to migrate to outer space and live extra-terrestrially.\\"Info- Psychology,\\" Chapter 12, Timothy Leary, 1994, New Falcon Publications, Phoenix, Arizona, USA Leary, Wilson, and Alli have written about the idea in depth, and have explored and attempted to define how each circuit operates, both in the lives of individual people and in societies and civilization.

The organism generally considers the environment benign and accepts and approaches. This is equivalent to a default life position of \\"you're ok\\" in the 'life positions' model of Transactional analysis.Prometheus Rising, pg. 74 *A negative imprint sets up a basic attitude of suspicion. The organism generally regards the environment as hostile and flees and avoids. This is equivalent to a default life position of \\"you're not ok\\" in the 'life positions' model of Transactional analysis. This circuit is said to have appeared in the earliest evolution of the invertebrate brain and corresponds to the reptilian brain of triune brain theory. This circuit operates in essentially the same way across mammals, reptiles, fish, primates and humans. Prometheus Rising, pg. 96 Robert Anton Wilson equated this circuit with the oral stage in the Freudian theory of psychosexual development, and proposed that this circuit is activated in adults by strong opioids.Prometheus Rising, pg. 47-48 =2. (Leary)The emotional-locomotion circuit (Wilson)The anal territorial circuitExo-Psychology, table of contentsQuantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201= The emotional-territorial circuit is imprinted in the toddler stage. It is concerned with domination and submission, territoriality, etc. The imprint on this circuit will trigger one of two states: *Dominant, aggressive behavior. This imprint creates an 'alpha' social attitude. Equivalent to the 'top dog' position in the model of Fritz Perls, to 'I'm OK' in the 'life positions' model of Transactional analysis, and to master morality in the model of Friedrich Nietzsche.Wilson, R.A. Prometheus Rising (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 79. *Submissive, co-operative behavior. Equivalent to the 'bottom dog' position in the model of Fritz Perls, to 'I'm not OK' in the life positions model and to Nietzschean 'slave morality'. This circuit is activated by depressant drugs such as alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines. This circuit appeared first in territorial vertebrate animals and is preserved across all mammals. It corresponds to the mammalian brain of triune brain theory. Robert Anton Wilson equated this circuit with the anal stage in the Freudian theory of psycho-sexual development. The first and second circuits both imprint in a binary fashion: trust/suspicion and dominance/submission. Thus there are four possible ways of imprinting the first two circuits: *Trusting 1st circuit and dominant 2nd circuit. I'm OK; you're OK. Friendly strength in the Interpersonal Circumplex. Fire in the four elements model.Wilson, R.A. \\"Prometheus Rising\\" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 73. Choleric in the four humors model. *Trusting 1st circuit and submissive 2nd circuit. I'm not OK; you're OK. Friendly weakness. Water in the four elements model. Phlegmatic humor. *Suspicious 1st circuit and dominant 2nd circuit. I'm OK; you're not OK. Unfriendly strength. Air in the four elements model. Sanguine humor. *Suspicious 1st circuit and submissive 2nd circuit. I'm not OK; you're not OK. Unfriendly weakness. Earth in the four elements model. Melancholic humor. =3. (Leary)The laryngeal-manual symbolic circuit (Wilson)The semantic time-binding circuitExo-Psychology, table of contentsQuantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201= This circuit is imprinted by human symbol systems. It is concerned with language, handling the environment, invention, calculation, prediction, building a mental \\"map\\" of the universe, physical dexterity, etc. This circuit is activated by stimulant drugs such as amphetamines, cathinones, cocaine, and caffeine. This circuit supposedly appeared first when hominids started differentiating from the rest of the primates. Robert Anton Wilson, being heavily influenced by General Semantics, writes of this circuit as the 'time- binding circuit'. This means that this circuit's contents ‚Äì including human know-how, technology, science etc. - are preserved memetically and passed on from generation to generation, constantly mutating and increasing in sophistication. =4. (Leary)The socio-sexual domestication circuit (Wilson)The socio-sexual circuitExo-Psychology, table of contentsQuantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201= This fourth circuit is imprinted by the first orgasm-mating experiences and tribal \\"morals\\". It is concerned with sexual pleasure (instead of sexual reproduction), local definitions of \\"moral\\" and \\"immoral\\", reproduction, rearing of the young, etc. The fourth circuit concerns itself with cultural values and operating within social networks. This circuit is said to have first appeared with the development of tribes. =5. (Leary and Wilson)The neurosomatic circuitExo-Psychology, table of contentsQuantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201= This is concerned with neurological-somatic feedbacks, feeling high and blissful, somatic reprogramming, etc. It may be called the rapture circuit.Leary, T., \\"Neurologic\\" (1973). Starseed Publications, San Francisco. When this circuit is activated, a non-conceptual feeling of well-being arises. This has a beneficial effect on the health of the physical body.Wilson, R.A., \\"Quantum Psychology\\" (1990). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 198 The fifth circuit is consciousness of the body. There is a marked shift from linear visual space to an all-encompassing aesthetic sensory space. Perceptions are judged not so much for their meaning and utility, but for their aesthetic qualities.Leary, T., \\"Neurologic\\" (1973). Starseed Publications, San Francisco. Page V-1. Experience of this circuit often accompanies an hedonistic turn-on, a rapturous amusement, a detachment from the previously compulsive mechanism of the first four circuits. This circuit is activated by ecstatic experiences via physiological effects of cannabis, Hatha Yoga, tantra and Zen meditation. Robert Anton Wilson writes, \\"Tantra yoga is concerned with shifting consciousness entirely into this circuit\\"Wilson, R.A. \\"Prometheus Rising\\" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 41. and that \\"Prolonged sexual play without orgasm always triggers some Circuit V consciousness\\".Wilson, R.A. \\"Prometheus Rising\\" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 184. Leary describes that this circuit first appeared in the upper classes, with the development of leisure-class civilizations around 2000 BC. =6. (Leary)The neuro-electric circuit (Wilson)The metaprogramming circuitExo-Psychology, table of contentsQuantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201= Note: Timothy Leary lists this circuit as the sixth, and the neurogenetic circuit as the seventh.Leary, T. (1977). \\"Neuropolitics\\". Starseed Peace Press, Los Angeles. In \\"Prometheus Rising\\", Robert Anton Wilson reversed the order of these two circuits,Wilson, R.A. \\"Prometheus Rising\\" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. describing the neurogenetic circuit as the sixth circuit, and the metaprogramming circuit as the seventh. In the subsequently published \\"Quantum Psychology\\", he reverted this back to the order proposed by Leary.Wilson, R.A. (1990). Quantum Psychology. New Falcon Press, Tempe, AZ. Seventh Printing, (2003). Page 199-200 This circuit is concerned with re-imprinting and re-programming all earlier circuits and the relativity of \\"realities\\" perceived. The sixth circuit consists of the nervous system becoming aware of itself. Leary says this circuit enables telepathic communication and is activated by low-to- moderate doses of LSD (50-150 Œºg), moderate doses of peyote, psilocybin mushrooms and meditation/chanting especially when used in a group or ritual setting. This circuit is traced by Leary back to 500 BC. =7. (Leary)The neurogenetic circuit (Wilson)The morphogenetic circuitExo-Psychology, table of contentsQuantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201= This circuit is the connection of the individual's mind to the whole sweep of evolution and life as a whole. It is the part of consciousness that echoes the experiences of the previous generations that have brought the individual's brain-mind to its present level. It deals with ancestral, societal and scientific DNA-RNA-brain feedbacks. Those who achieve this mutation may speak of past lives, reincarnation, immortality etc. It corresponds to the collective unconscious in the models of Carl Jung where archetypes reside. Activation of this circuit may be equated with consciousness of the Great God Pan in his aspect as Life as a whole, or with consciousness of Gaia, the biosphere considered as a single organism. This circuit is activated by higher doses of LSD (200-500 Œºg), higher doses of peyote, higher doses of psilocybin mushrooms, yoga and meditation. The circuit first appeared among the Hindus in the early first millennium and later reappeared among the Sufi sects. =8. (Leary)The neuro- atomic metaphysiological (Wilson)The non-local quantum circuitExo-Psychology, table of contentsQuantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201= The eighth circuit is concerned with quantum consciousness, non-local awareness (information from beyond ordinary space-time awareness which is limited by the speed of light), illumination. Some of the ways this circuit can get activated are: the awakening of kundalini, shock, a near-death experience, DMT, high doses of LSD and according to Robert Anton Wilson almost any dose of ketamine.Robert Anton Wilson - 8 Circuit Psychology 6/7 01/12/2018. This circuit has even been compared to the Buddhist concept of Indra's net from the Avatamsaka Sutra. Leary's contribution Leary stated \\"They [the theories presented in Info- Psychology] are scientific in that they are based on empirical findings from physics, physiology, pharmacology, genetics, astronomy, behavioral psychology, information science, and most importantly, neurology.\\" Info-Psychology, pg 8., seventh printing, 2011 or Info-Psychology, pg. 7, third printing, 1992 Leary called his book \\"science faction\\" or \\"psi-phy\\" and noted he had written it \\"in various prisons to which the author had been sentenced for dangerous ideology and violations of Newtonian and religious laws\\".Info-Psychology, p7. Although Leary propounded the basic premise of eight \\"brains\\" or brain circuits, he was inspired by sources such as the Hindu chakra system. Leary claimed that among other things this model explained the social conflict in the 1960s, where the mainstream was said to be those with four circuits active and characterized by Leary as tribal moralists and clashed with the counter-culturists, who were then said to be those with the fifth circuit active and characterized as individualists and hedonists. Leary's first book on the subject, Neurologic, only included seven circuits when it was published in 1973. Exo-Psychology, published in 1977, expanded the number of circuits to eight and clarified the subject. In it, he puts forward the theory that the later four circuits are \\"post terrestrial;\\" intended to develop as we migrate off this planet and colonize others. Once we begin space migration, according to Leary, we will have more ready access to these higher circuits. Exo-Psychology was re- published as revised by Timothy Leary with additional material in 1989 under the title Info-Psychology (New Falcon Publishing). Other authors on the eight circuits In chaos magic the eight circuits are sometimes related to the eight rays of the symbol of chaos Leary's ideas heavily influenced the work of Robert Anton Wilson. Wilson's 1983 book Prometheus Rising is an in- depth work documenting Leary's eight-circuit model of consciousness. Wilson's published 1993 screenplay, Reality Is What You Can Get Away With, uses and explains the model. Wilson, like Leary, wrote about the distinction between terrestrial and post-terrestrial life. Angel Tech by Antero Alli, is structured around the Eight-circuit model of consciousness. Alli defines the word angel as \\"a being of light\\" and tech from the word \\"techne\\" meaning \\"art\\". The title is defined as \\"the art of being light\\".Alli, Antero. (1985) \\"Angel Tech: A Modern Shaman's Guide to Reality Selection\\" New Falcon Publications, Tempe. It includes suggested activities such as meditations and construction of tarot-card collages associated with each circuit and imprint. The model is fairly prominent in chaos magic. This concept has been detailed in \\"Chaotopia!\\" by Dave Lee, a leading member of the magic society Illuminates of Thanateros. Leary and Wilson were also members of the society. Rolf Von Eckartsberg also appears to have been influenced by the model.Von Eckartsberg, R. (1981a). \\"Maps of the mind\\". In Valle, R. & von Eckarsberg, R. The metaphors of consciousness.

Early reign Peter I was the son of Simeon I of Bulgaria by his second marriage to the sister of George Sursuvul. Peter had been born early in the 10th century, but it appears that his maternal uncle was very influential at the beginning of his reign. In 913 Peter may have visited the imperial palace at Constantinople together with his older brother Michael. For unspecified reasons, Simeon had forced Michael to become a monk and had named Peter as his successor. To prove himself a worthy successor to his father both at home and in the eyes of foreign governments, Peter began his reign with a military offensive into Byzantine Thrace in 927 which was the last campaign of the Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian war of 913‚Äì927. Nevertheless, he followed up his quick successes by secretly negotiating a peace treaty before the Byzantine government had a chance to retaliate. The Byzantine Emperor Romanos I Lakapenos eagerly accepted the proposal for peace and arranged for a diplomatic marriage between his granddaughter Maria and the Bulgarian monarch. In October 927 Peter arrived near Constantinople to meet Romanos and signed the peace treaty, marrying Maria on 8 November in the church of the Zo√∂dochos Pege. To signify the new era in Bulgaro-Byzantine relations, the princess was renamed Eirene (\\"peace\\"). The extensive Preslav Treasure is thought to represent part of the dowry of the princess. The treaty of 927 actually represents the fruit of Simeon's military successes and diplomatic initiatives, ably continued by his son's government. Peace was obtained with the frontiers restored to those defined in treaties of 897 and 904. The Byzantines recognised the Bulgarian monarch's title of emperor (basileus, tsar) and the autocephalus status of the Bulgarian patriarchate, while the payment of an annual tribute to Bulgaria by the Byzantine Empire was renewed.Fine, pp. 160‚Äì161 BULGARIA, First Empire.

VF, beige patina. // From the Iconodule Collection. Revolts and incursions The initial successes of Peter's reign were followed by several minor setbacks. Around 930, Peter faced a revolt led by his younger brother Ivan, who was defeated and sent into exile in Byzantium. Soon afterwards Peter's older brother Michael escaped from his monastery and led a more formidable rebellion, which terminated with his early death. The youngest brother, Benjamin (also called Bojan), was accused of being a werewolf and magician by the Italian Bishop Liutprand of Cremona, but he apparently posed no threat to Peter's authority. Perhaps taking advantage of these challenges to Peter's rule, the Prince of Serbia ƒåaslav Klonimiroviƒá escaped the Bulgarian capital Preslav in 933 and, with tacit Byzantine support, managed to raise a Serbian revolt against Bulgarian rule.Runciman, A history of the First Bulgarian Empire, p. 185 The revolt succeeded and Serbia recovered its independence. Peter may have had to also face the incursions of the Magyars, who had been defeated and forced into Pannonia by his father in 896. Perhaps after an initial defeat, Peter came to terms with the enemy and now used Magyar groups as his allies against Serbia. Various Magyar clans and chieftains appear to have begun to settle in what was still Bulgarian territory north of the Danube, where they may have become Bulgarian federates, enjoying independence from the √Årp√°d dynasty. This arrangement paved the way for the eventual loss of the region to the Magyars, although that happened over the half-century following Peter's death. Peter apparently allowed these groups to cross Bulgaria and raid Byzantine territories in Thrace and Macedonia, perhaps as an underhanded reaction against Byzantine support for the Serbian rebellion. Domestic rule Peter I presided over a long and relatively peaceful reign, albeit one poorly illuminated by foreign or native sources. In spite of the challenges he encountered soon after his accession and the critical situation at the very end of his life, Peter's Bulgaria appears to have been prosperous and increasingly well organized, with an administrative apparatus noted by foreign travelers and confirmed by the numerous finds of imperial seals. Peter was particularly generous towards the Church, which he endowed lavishly throughout his reign. The emperor's generosity reached such an extent that it was seen as a corrupting factor by even Orthodox clerics, like Cosmas Presbyter. Others chose a path away from the temptations of the secular world, most notably Saint Ivan of Rila, but their ascetic existence still drew the attention of the monarch. Luxury and social tensions may have contributed to the spread of the Bogomil heresy, which Peter duly undertook to combat, soliciting the advice of famous hermits and even his uncle-in-law, Patriarch Theophylact of Constantinople. Conflict with Byzantium and Rus Relations with the Byzantine Empire worsened after the death of Peter's wife in the mid-960s. Victorious over the Arabs, Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas refused to pay the annual tribute to Bulgaria in 966, complaining of the Bulgarian alliance with the Magyars, and he undertook a show of force at the Bulgarian border. Dissuaded from a direct attack against Bulgaria, Nikephoros II dispatched a messenger to the Rus prince Sviatoslav Igorevich to arrange a Rus attack against Bulgaria from the north. The Death of Emperor Peter I. Sviatoslav readily launched a campaign with a vast force of 60,000 troops, routed the Bulgarians on the Danube, and defeated them in a battle near Silistra, seizing some 80 Bulgarian fortresses in 968. Stunned by the success of his ally and suspicious of his actual intentions, Emperor Nikephoros II hastened to make peace with Bulgaria and arranged the marriage of his wards, the underage emperors Basil II and Constantine VIII, to two Bulgarian princesses. Two of Peter's sons were sent to Constantinople as both negotiators and honorary hostages. In the meantime Peter managed to secure the retreat of the Rus forces by inciting Bulgaria's traditional allies, the Pechenegs, to attack Kiev itself. In spite of this temporary success and the reconciliation with Byzantium, Bulgaria faced a new invasion by Sviatoslav in 969. The Bulgarians were defeated again, and Peter suffered a stroke, which led him to abdicate and become a monk. He died on 30 January 970. Reputation Compared with the military success of his father's reign, Peter has been traditionally considered a weak ruler, who lost lands and prestige, allowed his military forces to decline while his country was ravaged by foreign invaders, and turned Bulgaria into a Byzantine satellite governed by Byzantine agents in the persons of his empress and her retinue. This view has been questioned by more recent scholarship, which emphasizes the affluence and internal peace enjoyed by Bulgarian society during his long reign, re- evaluates the relationship between Bulgaria and its semi-nomadic neighbors (Magyars and Pechenegs), and questions the allegedly sinister role of Romanos' granddaughter and her retinue. While Peter's reign witnessed the spread of the Bogomil heresy, its origins were more demographic (perhaps inspired by Paulicians settled earlier by Byzantine emperors in Thrace) than social, and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church canonized him as a saint. Peter was considered a good ruler in the Middle Ages, and when Bulgaria fell under Byzantine rule (1018‚Äì1185), leaders of attempts to restore Bulgarian independence adopted his name to emphasize legitimacy and continuity (both Peter Delyan and Constantine Bodin adopted the royal name of Peter in their attempts to regain the throne from the Byzantines). Family By his marriage to Maria Lakapena (renamed Eirene), Peter I had several children, including: * Plenimir * Boris II, who succeeded as emperor of Bulgaria in 969 * Roman, who succeeded as emperor of Bulgaria in 977 Honour Peter Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Peter I of Bulgaria.

At the time of his baptism in 864, Boris was named Michael after his godfather, Emperor Michael III. The historian Steven Runciman called him one of the greatest persons in history.Runciman, p. 152 Despite a number of military setbacks, the reign of Boris I was marked with significant events that shaped Bulgarian and European history. With the Christianization of Bulgaria in 864 paganism was abolished. A skilful diplomat, Boris I successfully exploited the conflict between the Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Papacy to secure an autocephalous Bulgarian Church, thus dealing with the nobility's concerns about Byzantine interference in Bulgaria's internal affairs. When in 885 the disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius were banished from Great Moravia, Boris I gave them refuge and provided assistance to develop the Cyrillic script and the Slavic literature. After he abdicated in 889, his eldest son and successor tried to restore the old pagan religion but was deposed by Boris I. During the Council of Preslav which followed that event, the Byzantine clergy was replaced with Bulgarians, and the Greek language was replaced with what is now known as Old Church Slavonic, which in Bulgaria is known as Old Bulgarian, as an official language of the Church and the state. He is regarded as a saint in the Orthodox Church, as the Prince and baptizer of Bulgaria, and as Equal-to-the- Apostles, with his feast day observed on May 2. ·Ωâ ·ºçŒ≥ŒπŒøœÇ ŒíœåœÅŒπœÇ ‚Äì ŒúŒπœáŒ±·Ω¥Œª ·ΩÅ ·ºπœÉŒ±œÄœåœÉœÑŒøŒªŒøœÇ ·ΩÅ œÄœÅŒØŒ≥Œ∫ŒπœÄŒ±œÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œ¶œâœÑŒπœÉœÑ·øÜœÇ œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒíŒøœÖŒªŒ≥Œ±œÅŒπŒ∫Œø·ø¶ ŒªŒ±Œø·ø¶. 2 ŒúŒ±ŒêŒøœÖ.

The only direct evidence of Boris's title are his seals and the inscription found near the town of Ballsh, modern Albania, and at Varna.

Reign =Central Europe in the 9th century= The early 9th century marked the beginning of a fierce rivalry between the Greek East and Latin West, which would ultimately lead to the schism between the Eastern Orthodox Church in Constantinople and the Catholic Church in Rome. As early as 781, the Empress Irene began to seek a closer relationship with the Carolingian dynasty and the Papacy. She negotiated a marriage between her son, Constantine, and Rotrude, a daughter of Charlemagne by his third wife Hildegard. Irene went as far as to send an official to instruct the Frankish princess in Greek; however, Irene herself broke off the engagement in 787, against her son's wishes. When the Second Council of Nicaea of 787 reintroduced the veneration of icons under Empress Irene, the result was not recognized by Charlemagne since no Frankish emissaries had been invited even though Charlemagne was by then ruling more than three provinces of the old Roman empire. While this improved relations with the Papacy, it did not prevent the outbreak of a war with the Franks, who took over Istria and Benevento in 788. When Charlemagne was proclaimed Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by Leo III, the Pope was effectively nullifying the legitimacy of Irene. He certainly desired to increase the influence of the papacy and to honour his protector Charlemagne. Irene, like many of her predecessors since Justinian I, was too weak to protect Rome and its much reduced citizenry and the city was not being ruled by any emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not seen as an usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It was, however, seen as such in Byzantium, but protests by Irene and her successor Nicephorus I had no great effect. Mojm√≠r I managed to unite some Slavic princes and established Great Moravia in 833. His successor, Rastislav, also fought against the Germans.–ö. –ì—Ä–æ—Ç, –ú–æ—Ä–∞–≤–∏—è –∏ –ú–∞–¥—è—Ä—ã, –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥, 1881, —Å—Ç—Ä. 108 –∏ —Å–ª.

Porphyr., De admin, imp., ed. Bon, cap. 31, p. 150‚Äì151 As a result of the military actions in 855, the peace between Bulgaria and Eastern Francia was restored, and Rastislav was forced to fight against Louis alone. In the meantime, a conflict between the Byzantines and Bulgarians had started in 855‚Äì856, and Boris, distracted by his conflict with Louis, lost Philippopolis (Plovdiv), the region of Zagora, and the ports around the Gulf of Burgas on the Black Sea to the Byzantine army led by Michael III and the caesar Bardas.Gjuzelev, p. 130Bulgarian historical review, v.33: no. 1‚Äì4, p. 9. Serbia After the death of Knez Vlastimir of Serbia circa 850, his state was divided between his sons. Vlastimir and Boris' father had fought against each other in the Bulgarian-Serbian War of 839‚Äì842, which resulted in a Serbian victory, and Boris sought to avenge that defeat. In 853 or 854, the Bulgarian army led by Vladimir-Rasate, the son of Boris I, invaded Serbia, with the aim of replacing the Byzantine overlordship over the Serbs. The Serbian army was led by Mutimir and his two brothers; they defeated the Bulgarians, capturing Vladimir and 12 boyars.Fine, The Early Medieval Balkans, p. 141 Boris I and Mutimir agreed to peace (and perhaps an alliance), and Mutimir sent his sons Pribislav and Stefan to the border to escort the prisoners, where they exchanged items as a sign of peace. Boris himself gave them \\"rich gifts\\", while he was given \\"two slaves, two falcons, two dogs, and 80 furs\\".F.

PDF The reason for the feud is not known, though it is postulated that it was a result of treachery. Petar would later defeat Pribislav, Mutimir's son, and take the Serbian throne. =Motivations for baptism and conversion to Christianity= Depiction in the Madrid Skylitzes of Boris I's baptism. There are a number of versions as to why Boris converted to Christianity. Some historians attribute it to the intervention of his sister who had already converted while being at Constantinople. Another story mentions a Greek slave in the ruler's court. A more mythological version is the one in which Boris is astonished and frightened by an icon of Judgement day and thus decides to adopt Christianity. Richard B. Spence sees the decision as deliberate, practical, and politic. For a variety of diplomatic reasons, Boris became interested in converting to Christianity. In order to both extend his control over the Slavic world and gain an ally against one of the most powerful foes of the Bulgars, the Byzantine Empire, Boris sought to establish an alliance with Louis the German against Ratislav of Moravia. Through this alliance, Louis promised to supply Boris with missionaries, which would have effectively brought the Bulgars under the Roman Church. However, late in 863, the Byzantine Empire under Emperor Michael III declared war on Boris and the Bulgars during a period of famine and natural disasters. Taken by surprise, Boris was forced to make peace with the Byzantines, promising to convert to Christianity according to the eastern rites, in exchange for peace and territorial concessions in Thrace (he regained the region of Zagora recently recovered by the Byzantines).Fine, pp. 118‚Äì119 At the beginning of 864, Boris was secretly baptized at Pliska by an embassy of Byzantine clergymen, together with his family and select members of the Bulgarian nobility. With Emperor Michael III as his godfather, Boris also adopted the Christian name Michael.Anderson, 1999, p. 80 Separate from diplomatic concerns, Boris was interested in converting himself and the Bulgarians to Christianity to resolve the disunity within the Bulgarian society. When he ascended to the throne, the Bulgars and Slavs were separate elements within Boris' kingdom, the minority Bulgars constituting a military aristocracy. Richard Spence compares it to the relationship between the Normans and Saxons in England.Spence, Richard B., \\"Boris I of Bulgaria\\", Dictionary of World Biography, Vol.2, (Frank Northen Magill, Alison Aves, eds.), Routledge, 1998 Religious plurality further contributed to divisions within the society. The Slavs had their own polytheistic belief system while the Bulgar elite believed in Tangra, the Sky God, or God of Heaven. The arrival of Methodius and his followers introduced the Cyrillic alphabet, freeing the Bulgarians from dependence on Greek as a written and liturgical language. A Slavic Christian culture developed that helped unify the realm. =Baptism of the Bulgarians and the establishment of the Bulgarian Church= Depiction in the Manases Chronicle of Boris I' baptism. After his baptism, the first major task that Boris undertook was the baptism of his subjects and for this task he appealed to Byzantine priests between 864 and 866. At the same time Boris sought further instruction on how to lead a Christian lifestyle and society and how to set up an autocephalous church from the Byzantine Patriarch Photios. Photios' answer proved less than satisfactory, and Boris sought to gain a more favorable settlement from the Papacy. Boris dispatched emissaries led by the kavhan Peter with a long list of questions to Pope Nicholas I at Rome in August 866, and obtained 106 detailed answers, detailing the essence of religion, law, politics, customs and personal faith. Stemming from his concerns with the baptism of the Bulgarians, Boris also complained to Nicholas about the abuses perpetrated by the Byzantine priests responsible for baptizing the Bulgarians and how he could go about correcting the consequences resulting from these abuses. The pope temporarily glossed over the controversial question of the autocephalous status desired by Boris for his church and sent a large group of missionaries to continue the conversion of Bulgaria in accordance with the western rite.Duffy, 2006, p. 103 Bulgaria's shift towards the Papacy infuriated Patriarch Photios, who wrote an encyclical to the eastern clergy in 867 in which he denounced the practices associated with the western rite and Rome's ecclesiastical intervention in Bulgaria. This occasioned the Photian Schism, which was a major step in the rift between the eastern and western churches. To deliver his response to Boris‚Äô questions, Pope Nicholas I sent two bishops to Bulgaria: Paul of Populonia and Formosus of Porto. The Pope expected that these priests would execute their episcopal responsibilities to address Boris‚Äô concerns, but did not intend for them to be elevated to the positions that they assumed in the Bulgar hierarchy. In Bulgaria, the activities of Bishop Formosus (later Pope Formosus) met with success, until the pope rejected Boris' request to nominate Formosus as archbishop of Bulgaria. Nicholas justified the rejection of the request by arguing that it was ‚Äúuncanonical to transfer an already established bishop from one see to another‚Äù. The new Pope Adrian II refused Boris' request for a similar nomination of either Formosus or Deacon Marinus (later Pope Marinus I), after which Bulgaria began to shift towards Constantinople once again. At the Fourth Council of Constantinople in 870 the position of the Bulgarian church was reopened by Bulgarian envoys, and the eastern patriarchs adjudicated in favor of Constantinople. This determined the future of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, which was granted the status of an autocephalous archbishopric by the Patriarchate of Constantinople and an archbishop of its own. Later in the 870s, the Patriarch of Constantinople surrendered Bulgaria to the Papacy, but this concession was purely nominal, as it did not affect the actual position of Bulgaria's autocephalous church. The Christianization of the Bulgarians as a result of Boris‚Äô actions had profound effects not only on the religious belief system of the Bulgarians but also the structure of the Bulgarian government. Upon embracing Christianity, Boris took on the title of Tsar and joined the community of nations that embraced Christ, to the great delight of the Eastern Roman Empire, which was later given the name Byzantium by historians. Toward the end of his reign, Boris began to increase the number of native Bulgarian clergy. Consequently, Boris began to send Bulgarians to Constantinople to obtain a monastic education and some of these Bulgarians returned to their homeland to serve as clergymen. In 885, Boris was presented with a new opportunity to establish a native clergy when Slavic-speaking disciples of St. Cyril and St. Methodius were forced to flee from Moravia after a German-inspired reaction to the death of the apostle. =Changes to Bulgarian culture brought on by Clement and Naum= Tsar Boris I meeting the disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius In 886 Boris' governor of Belgrade welcomed the disciples of Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius, who were exiled from Great Moravia into Bulgaria and sent them on to Boris in Pliska. Boris happily greeted two of these disciples, Clement of Ohrid and Naum of Preslav, who were of noble Bulgarian origin. To utilize the disciple's talents, Boris commissioned Clement to be a ‚Äúteacher‚Äù of a territory of a province in the Macedonian area of the Bulgar realm. Both Clement and Naum were instrumental in furthering the cultural, linguistic and spiritual works of Cyril and Methodius. They set up educational centers in Pliska and in Ohrid to further the development of Slavonic letters and liturgy. Clement later trained thousands of Slavonic-speaking priests who replaced the Greek-speaking clergy from Constantinople still present in the Bulgar kingdom. The alphabet that was originally developed by Cyril and Methodius is known as the Glagolitic alphabet. In Bulgaria, Clement of Ohrid and Naum of Preslav created (or rather compiled) the new alphabet which was called Cyrillic and was declared the official alphabet in Bulgaria in 893. The Slavic language was declared as official in the same year. In the following centuries this alphabet was adopted by other Slavic peoples and states. The introduction of Slavic liturgy paralleled Boris' continued development of churches and monasteries throughout his realm. =Reactions to religious conversion= Conversion to Christianity met great opposition among the Bulgarian elite. Some refused to become Christians while others apostatized after baptism and started a rebellion against Boris for forcing them to be baptized. Some people did not object necessarily to the Christian religion but to the fact that it was brought by foreign priests, which, as a result, established external foreign policy. By breaking the power of the old cults, Boris reduced the influence of the boyars, who resisted the khan's authority. In the summer of 865 a group of Bulgar aristocrats (boyars) started an open revolt. Boris ruthlessly suppressed it and executed 52 boyars together with their entire families. Thus the Christianization continued. End of Boris' reign In 889 Boris abdicated the throne and became a monk. His son and successor Vladimir attempted a pagan reaction, which brought Boris out of retirement in 893. Vladimir was defeated and Boris had him blinded, his wife shaved and sent to a monastery. Boris gathered the Council of Preslav placing his third son, Tsar Simeon I of Bulgaria, on the throne, threatening him with the same fate if he too apostatized. Boris returned to his monastery, emerging once again in c. 895 to help Simeon fight the Magyars, who had invaded Bulgaria in alliance with the Byzantines. After the passing of this crisis, Boris resumed monastic life and died in 907. The location of his retreat, where perhaps he was interred, is not certain; it may be near Preslav, or Pliska, or in a monastery near Varna or Ravda. Legacy St. Boris Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named for Boris I of Bulgaria.

The Ward refers to itself as Shinagawa City in English. The Ward is home to ten embassies. , the Ward had an estimated population of 380,293 and a population density of 16,510 persons per km¬≤. The total area is 22.84 km¬≤. Shinagawa is also commonly used to refer to the business district around Shinagawa Station, which is not in Shinagawa Ward. This Shinagawa is in the Takanawa and Konan neighborhoods of Minato Ward, directly north of Kita-Shinagawa. Geography Shinagawa Ward includes natural uplands and lowlands, as well as reclaimed land. The uplands are the eastern end of the Musashino Terrace. They include Shiba-Shirokanedai north of the Meguro River, Megurodai between the Meguro and Tachiai Rivers, and Ebaradai south of the Tachiai River. The Ward lies on Tokyo Bay. Its neighbors on land are all special wards of Tokyo: K≈çt≈ç to the east, Minato to the north, Meguro to the west, and ≈åta to the south. =Districts and neighborhoods= Shinagawa Ward consists of five areas, each consisting of multiple districts and neighborhoods: *Shinagawa District, including the former Shinagawa-juku on the T≈çkaid≈ç. * District, formerly a town of that name, stretching from ≈åsaki Station to Gotanda and Meguro Stations. * District, formerly a town of that name. * District, formerly a town of that name. * District, consisting of reclaimed land, including Higashiyashio on Odaiba. ;Shinagawa Area * Higashishinagawa * Hiromachi * Kitashinagawa * Minamishinagawa * Nishishinagawa ;Oi Area * Oi * Higashioi * Katsushima * Minamioi * Nishioi ;Osaki Area * ≈åsaki * Higashigotanda * Kami≈çsaki * Nishigotanda ;Ebara Area * Ebara * Futaba * Hatanodai * Higashinakanobu * Hiratsuka * Koyama * Koyamadai * Nakanobu * Nishinakanobu * Togoshi * Yutakacho ;Yashio Area * Yashio * Higashiyashio History Shinagawa-juku in the 1830s, as depicted by Hiroshige Most of Tokyo east of the Imperial Palace is on reclaimed land. A large proportion of the reclamation took place during the Edo period, when Shinagawa-juku was the first shukuba (post town) in the \\"53 Stations of the T≈çkaid≈ç\\" that a traveler would reach after setting out from Nihonbashi to Kyoto on the T≈çkaid≈ç. The Tokugawa shogunate maintained the Suzugamori execution grounds in Shinagawa. Following the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the han system, Shinagawa Prefecture was instituted in 1869. The prefectural administration was to be set up in the Ebara District, but in 1871 Shinagawa Prefecture was integrated into Tokyo Prefecture. In 1932, during the reorganisation of the municipal boundaries of Tokyo City following the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake, a smaller version of Shinagawa Ward was created. On March 15, 1947, this was merged with the neighboring Ebara Ward to create the present Shinagawa Ward. The Ward's historic post-town function is retained today with several large hotels near the train station offering 6,000 rooms, the largest concentration in Tokyo. The T≈çkaid≈ç Shinkansen high-speed rail line began serving Shinagawa Station in 2003. Politics and government Shinagawa is run by an assembly of 40 elected members. =Embassies in Shinagawa= * Belarus * Brunei * Colombia * Indonesia * Mauritania * Myanmar * North Macedonia * Thailand * Zambia Economy =Corporate headquarters= Japan Airlines headquarters in Tenn≈çzu Isle, Shinagawa Sega's main headquarters in Shinagawa Many companies are headquartered in Shinagawa Ward.

The English translation of its Japanese self-designation is Meguro City. The ward was founded on March 15, 1947. Meguro is predominantly residential in character, but is also home to light industry, corporate head offices, the Komaba campus of University of Tokyo as well as fifteen foreign embassies and consulates. Residential neighborhoods include, Jiyugaoka, Kakinokizaka, and Nakameguro. As of May 1, 2015, the ward has an estimated population of 277,171 and a population density of 18,890 persons per km2. The total area is 14.67 km2. Meguro is also used to refer to the area around Meguro Station, which is not located in Meguro ward, but in neighboring Shinagawa's Kami≈çsaki district.  History  The Higashiyama shell mound in the north of the ward contains remains from the paleolithic, J≈çmon, Yayoi, and Kofun periods. The area now known as Meguro was formerly two towns, Meguro proper and Hibusuma, all parts of the former Ebara District of Musashi Province. The two were merged into a Meguro ward for Tokyo City in 1932 and since then the ward has remained with no alterations to its territory. The name \\"Meguro\\", meaning \\"black eyes\\", derives from the Meguro Fud≈ç (Black-eyed Fud≈ç-my≈ç≈ç) of Ry≈´senji. The Meguro Fud≈ç was one of five Fud≈ç- my≈ç≈ç statues placed at strategic points on the outskirts of Edo in the early seventeenth century by the abbot Tenkai, an advisor to Tokugawa Ieyasu, to provide protection for the new capital of the Tokugawa shogunate.Paul Waley, Tokyo: City of Stories (Tokyo: Weatherhill, 1991), 237.

Koreans mainly live in the two Korean states: North Korea and South Korea (collectively and simply referred to as Korea). Korean people are one of the largest ethnic groups in the world. They are also an officially recognized ethnic minority in China, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam, plus in a number of post-Soviet states, such as Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Over the course of the 20th century, significant Korean communities have formed in the Americas (especially in the United States and Canada) and Oceania. As of 2020, there were an estimated 8.3 million ethnic Koreans residing outside Korea. Etymology South Koreans refer to themselves as Hanguk-in (, Hanja: ÈüìÂúã‰∫∫) or Hanguk-saram (), both of which mean \\"Korean country people.\\" When including members of the Korean diaspora, Koreans often use the term Han-in (, ). Korean Americans refer to themselves as Hangukgye-Migukin (, Hanja: ÈüìÂúãÁ≥ªÁæéÂúã‰∫∫). North Koreans refer to themselves as Joseon-in (, Hanja: ÊúùÈÆÆ‰∫∫) or Joseon-saram (), both of which literally mean \\"Korean [Joseon] people\\". The term is derived from the Joseon dynasty, a Korean kingdom founded by Yi Seonggye that lasted for approximately five centuries from 1392 to 1910. Using similar words, Koreans in China refer to themselves as Chaoxianzu () in Chinese or Joseonjok, Joseonsaram () in Korean, which are cognates that literally mean \\"Joseon ethnic group\\". Koreans in Japan refer to themselves as Zainichi Chousenjin, Chousenjin () in Japanese or Jaeil Joseonin, Joseonsaram, Joseonin () in Korean. In the chorus of the South Korean national anthem, Koreans are referred to as Daehan-saram (, ). Ethnic Koreans living in Russia and Central Asia refer to themselves as Koryo-saram (; Cyrillic: –ö–æ—Ä—ë —Å–∞—Ä–∞–º), alluding to Goryeo, a Korean dynasty spanning from 918 to 1392. Origins =Linguistic and archaeological studies= Modern Koreans are suggested to be the descendants of the ancient people from Manchuria, Mongolia and southern Siberia, who settled in the northern Korean Peninsula. Archaeological evidence suggests that proto-Koreans were migrants from Manchuria during the Bronze Age. According to most linguists and archaeologists with expertise in ancient Korea, the linguistic homeland of proto-Korean and of the early Koreans is located somewhere in Manchuria, particularly the Liao river. Later, Koreanic- speakers already present in northern Korea started to expand further south, replacing and assimilating Japonic-speakers and likely causing the Yayoi migration.Vovin, Alexander (2013). \\"From Koguryo to Tamna: Slowly riding to the South with speakers of Proto-Korean\\". Korean Linguistics. 15 (2): 222‚Äì240. Whitman (2012) suggests that the proto-Koreans arrived in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula at around 300 BCE and coexisted with the descendants of the Japonic Mumun cultivators (or assimilated them). Vovin suggests Old Korean was established in southern Manchuria and northern Korean peninsula by the Three Kingdoms of Korea period, and migrated from there to southern Korea during this period by Goguryeo migrants. Linguistic evidence indicates speakers of The largest concentration of dolmens in the world is found on the Korean Peninsula. In fact, with an estimated 35,000-100,000 dolmen, Korea accounts for nearly 70% of the world's total. Similar dolmens can be found in Manchuria, the Shandong Peninsula and the Kyushu island, yet it is unclear why this culture only flourished so extensively on the Korean Peninsula and its surroundings compared to the bigger remainder of Northeastern Asia. =Anthropometry= Stephen Pheasant (1986), who taught anatomy, biomechanics and ergonomics at the Royal Free Hospital and the University College, London, said that Far Eastern people have proportionately shorter lower limbs than Europeans and black Africans. Pheasant said that the proportionately short lower limbs of Far Eastern people is a difference that is most characterized in Japanese people, less characterized in Korean and Chinese people, and the least characterized in Vietnamese and Thai people.Pheasant, Stephen.

Neville Moray (2005) said that, for Korean and Japanese pilots, sitting height is more than 54% of their stature, with about 46% of their stature from leg length. Moray said that, for Americans and most Europeans, sitting height is about 52% of their stature, with about 48% of their stature from leg length.Moray, Neville. (2005).

Craniometry In a craniometric study, Pietrusewsky (1994) found that the Japanese series, which was a series that spanned from the Yayoi period to modern times, formed a single branch with Korea.Kumar, Ann. (2009). Globalizing the Prehistory of Japan: Language, Genes and Civilisation. London and New York: Routledge Taylor & Francis Group. Page 79 & 88\\\\. Retrieved 23 January 2018, from link. Later, Pietrusewsky (1999) found, however, that Korean and Yayoi people were very highly separated in the East Asian cluster, indicating that the connection that Japanese have with Korea would not have derived from Yayoi people. Park Dae-kyoon et al. (2001) said that distance analysis based on thirty-nine non-metric cranial traits showed that Koreans are closer craniometrically to Kazakhs and Mongols than Koreans are close craniometrically to the populations in China and Japan. =Genetics= Studies of polymorphisms in the human Y-chromosome have so far produced evidence to suggest that the Korean people have a long history as a distinct, mostly endogamous ethnic group, with successive waves of people moving to the peninsula and two major Y-chromosome haplogroups. Koreans also show a close genetic relationship with other modern East Asians such as the Han Chinese and Japanese and with Neolithic specimens recovered from Chertovy Vorota Cave in Primorsky Krai.

Park said that many Koreans seem to have a genealogical memory blackout before the twentieth century.Eugene Y. Park. (n.d.). Penn Arts & Sciences East Asian Languages and Civilizations. Retrieved 24 January 2018, from link. Eugene Y. Park, from the 7:06 mark of the YouTube video to the 7:38 mark of the YouTube video, said, \\"Secondly, on the one hand, so many Koreans seem to talk, to be able to tell, one, something about his or her Gyeongju Kim ancestors, of a Silla kingdom two-thousand years ago. And yet, such a person is unlikely to be able to tell you something about his or her great-great-grandparents, what they were doing hundred years ago, what their occupations were, where they were living, where their family graves are. In other words, a memory blackout, before the twentieth century.\\" According to him the vast majority Koreans do not know their actual genealogical history. Through \\"inventing tradition\\" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, families devised a kind of master narrative story that purports to explain a surname-ancestral seat combination's history to the extent where it is next to impossible to look beyond these master narrative stories.Eugene Y. Park, from the 16:54 mark of the YouTube video to the 18:54 mark of the YouTube video, said, \\"So, from this point on, then, I would like to survey, how the Koreans descended. Koreans, depending on their ancestors' status category, have dealt with genealogy and ancestry consciousness, in the last, differently, in the last two centuries. And, of course, most Koreans are not descendants of aristocrats, but, the, but what happened in the last hundred fifty, hundred to hundred fifty years, is that those Koreans, the vast majority of Koreans have lost memory of their actual history, in the sense where now, any outside observer who might ask a Korean person about ancestry, would be left with the impression that every Korean is now of aristocratic descent. So let me begin with the aristocracy. In the early modern era, the kind of a master narrative, stories that purport to explain a particular surname-ancestral seat combination's history, crystallize, they became set in stone, through inventing tradition. In the seventeenth and eighteenth century, many, all families devise such a stories, to the extent where, now today in Korea, anybody who is interested in tracing his or her ancestry, has to deal with such master narratives, but at the same time it is next to impossible to look beyond master narratives. In other words, in Korea, today, there's little sense of doing the kind of doing the genealogical research that you and I would do in the United States, by looking at Census documents, and other types of documentation, that have been passed down through generations, or, have been maintained by the government.\\" He gave an example of what \\"inventing tradition\\" was like from his own family's genealogy where a document from 1873 recorded three children in a particular family and a later 1920 document recorded an extra son in that same family.Eugene Y. Park, from the 28:32 mark of the YouTube video to the 29:21 mark of the YouTube video, said, \\"This is an example. Here we see records that gives us a better sense of what inventing tradition was like. Here, a page from an eighteen seventy-three Miryang Pak family genealogy. Here's a man, indicated inside the circle named, Ju (ÂÜë). He had three sons: Eun-gyeong, Hyeon-gyeong, Won-gyeong (Â≠ê ÊÅ© ÊÖ∂, Â≠ê Ë≥¢ ÊÖ∂, Â≠ê ÂÖÉ ÊÖ∂). But the edition that was published a bit later in the nineteen twenty, so we see the same man, Ju, and, under him, we see sons: Eun-gyeong, Hyeon-gyeong, Won-gyeong and, the extra, the fourth son, out of nowhere, T≈çkhwa (Â≠ê Âæ≥ ËèØ). Actually, this is my family. So, this was commonly done in the modern era, the children, son out of nowhere or claims that we were left out centuries ago, and please include us.\\" Park said that these master narratives connect the same surname and ancestral seat to a single, common ancestor. This trend became universal in the nineteenth century, but genealogies which were published in the seventeenth century actually admit that they did not know how the different lines of the same surname or ancestral seat are related at all.Eugene Y. Park, from the 18:55 mark of the YouTube video to the 19:30 mark of the YouTube video, said, \\"And, these master narratives, genealogically connect all descent lines of a same surname and ancestral seat, to a single, common, ancestor. And, this was the pattern that was, that became universal by the nineteenth century. Whereas, genealogies published in the seventeenth century, actually, frankly admit that we do not know how these different lines of the same surname or ancestral seat are related or connected at all. So, all these changes took place only in the last two hundred years or so.\\" Only a small percentage of Koreans had surnames and ancestral seats to begin with, and that the rest of the Korean population had adopted these surname and ancestral seat identities within the last two to three hundred years.Eugene Y. Park, from the 46:17 mark of the YouTube video to the 47:02 mark of the YouTube video, said, \\"At any rate, so, once, so, based on one's surname Kim, let's say, and the ancestral seat, Kimhae, which is the most common ancestral seat among Kim surname Koreans, one can then look up, consult reference books, encyclopedias, go online to, find all these stories about different branches, famous individuals who are Kimhae Kim. But the problem is, of course, before the early modern era, only a small percentage of Koreans had surnames and the ancestral seat to begin with. In other words, the rest of the population had adopted these identities in the last two-three hundred years, so where does one go from there? And, this was definitely my challenge when I was a child.\\" Culture Children's Day in Cheong Wa Dae. Former South Korean President Park Geun-hye (center) hugs a boy at a meeting with children invited to Cheong Wa Dae to mark Children's Day on 5 May North Korea and South Korea share a common heritage, but the political division since 1945 has resulted in some divergence of their modern cultures. Language The language of the Korean people is the Korean language, which uses Hangul as its main writing system with a minor use of Hanja. There are more than 78 million speakers of the Korean language worldwide. Demographics Traditional Korean royal wedding ceremony with the male royal wearing Chinese royal costume Large-scale emigration from Korea began as early as the mid-1860s, mainly into the Russian Far East and Northeast China or what was historically known as Manchuria; these populations would later grow to more than two million Koreans in China and several hundred thousand Koryo-saram (ethnic Koreans in Central Asia and the former USSR). During the Korea under Japanese rule of 1910‚Äì1945, Koreans were often recruited and or forced into labour service to work in mainland Japan, Karafuto Prefecture (Sakhalin), and Manchukuo; the ones who chose to remain in Japan at the end of the war became known as Zainichi Koreans, while the roughly 40 thousand who were trapped in Karafuto after the Soviet invasion are typically referred to as Sakhalin Koreans. = South Korea = In June 2012, South Korea's population reached 50 million and by the end of 2016, South Korea's population has surpassed 51 million people. Since the 2000s, South Korea has been struggling with a low birthrate, leading some researchers to suggest that if current population trends hold, the country's population will shrink to approximately 38 million population towards the end of the 21st century.These estimates are based on UN population division of 2017 version. In 2018, fertility in South Korea became again a topic of international debate after only 26,500 babies were born in October and an estimated of 325,000 babies in the year, causing the country to have the lowest birth rate in the world. =North Korea= North Korean soldiers wearing Soviet-inspired uniform in the Joint Security Area Estimating the size, growth rate, sex ratio, and age structure of North Korea's population has been extremely difficult. Until release of official data in 1989, the 1963 edition of the North Korea Central Yearbook was the last official publication to disclose population figures. After 1963 demographers used varying methods to estimate the population. They either totalled the number of delegates elected to the Supreme People's Assembly (each delegate representing 50,000 people before 1962 and 30,000 people afterwards) or relied on official statements that a certain number of persons, or percentage of the population, was engaged in a particular activity. Thus, on the basis of remarks made by President Kim Il-sung in 1977 concerning school attendance, the population that year was calculated at 17.2 million persons. During the 1980s, health statistics, including life expectancy and causes of mortality, were gradually made available to the outside world. Fourth ed. Washington: Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress. . In 1989, the Central Bureau of Statistics released demographic data to the United Nations Population Fund in order to secure the UNFPA's assistance in holding North Korea's first nationwide census since the establishment of the state in 1948. Although the figures given to the United Nations might have been distorted, it appears that in line with other attempts to open itself to the outside world, the North Korean regime has also opened somewhat in the demographic realm. Although the country lacks trained demographers, accurate data on household registration, migration, and births and deaths are available to North Korean authorities. According to the United States scholar Nicholas Eberstadt and demographer Brian Ko, vital statistics and personal information on residents are kept by agencies on the ri (\\"village\\", the local administrative unit) level in rural areas and the dong (\\"district\\" or \\"block\\") level in urban areas. = Korean Americans = Korean emigration to the U.S. was known to have begun as early as 1903, but the Korean American community did not grow to a significant size until after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965; as of 2017, excluding the undocumented and uncounted, roughly 1.85 million Koreans emigrants and people of Korean descent live in the United States according to the official figure by the US Census. The Greater Los Angeles Area and New York metropolitan area in the United States contain the largest populations of ethnic Koreans outside of Korea or China. Significant Korean populations are present in China, Japan, and Canada as well. There are also Korean communities in Latin American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. During the 1990s and 2000s, the number of Koreans in the Philippines and Koreans in Vietnam have also grown significantly. Koreans in the United Kingdom now form Western Europe's largest Korean community, albeit still relatively small; Koreans in Germany used to outnumber those in the UK until the late 1990s. In Australia, Korean Australians comprise a modest minority. Koreans have migrated significantly since the 1960s. Now they form an integral part in society especially in Business, Education and Cultural areas. The Korean population in the United States represents a small share of the American economy, but has a disproportionately positive impact. Korean Americans have a savings rate double that of the U.S. average and also graduate from college at a rate double that of the U.S. average, providing highly skilled and educated professionals to the American workforce. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's Census 2000 data, mean household earnings for ethnic Koreans in the U.S. was $59,981, approximately 5.1% higher than the U.S. average at the time of $56,604. =Part-Korean populations= Pak Noja said that there were 5,747 Japanese-Korean couples in Korea at the end of 1941.Tikhonov, Vladimir.

He ruled during an extensive expansion in Macedonia. Origin The composite picture of the Byzantine sources indicates that Presian I was the son of Zvinitsa (Zbƒìnitzƒìs), who was a son of Omurtag. In several older studies Presian is identified with his short-lived predecessor Malamir and it is assumed that this single character survived until the 850s as the direct predecessor of Boris I. This is very unlikely, as Malamir is attested as having been succeeded by his nephew (the son of his brother Zvinitsa), while Boris I was preceded by his father Presian. Zlatarski resolved the problems in the fragmentary sources by determining that Malamir‚Äôs unnamed nephew and successor was in fact Presian, and Boris I was the latter‚Äôs son. The 17th century Volga Bulgar compilation C√§ƒüf√§r Tar√≠xƒ±, a work of disputed authenticity, represents Bird≈æihan (i.e., Presian) as the son of Saban≈°a (i.e., Zvinitsa), which may lend support to the interpretation of his origins now dominant in Bulgarian historiography.  Conflict with Serbia and Byzantium  Presian Inscription, sixth plate, Archeological Museum, Philippi, Greece. Presian may have been young and inexperienced at the time of his accession, and state affairs may have been dominated by the minister (Kavkhan) Isbul, as under Presian's uncle Malamir. In 837, soon after Presian's accession, the Slavs in the vicinity of Thessalonica rebelled against the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Theophilos sought Bulgarian support in putting down the rebellion, but simultaneously arranged for his fleet to sail through the Danube delta and undertake a clandestine evacuation of some of the Byzantine captives settled in trans-Danubian Bulgaria by Krum and Omurtag. Bulgaria under Presian In retaliation Isbul campaigned along the Aegean coasts of Thrace and Macedonia and captured the city of Philippi, where he set up a surviving memorial inscription set up in a local church. Isbul's campaign may have resulted in the establishment of Bulgarian suzerainty over the Slavic tribe of the Smolyani. Presian's reign coincides with the extension of Bulgarian control over the Slavic tribes in and around Macedonia. It is known that the Serbs and Bulgars lived in peace until Presian invaded Serbian territory in 839, during the last years of Theophilos. Vlastimir, the Knez of Serbia, united several Serbian tribes,L. Kovacevic & L.

The annexation of western Macedonia by the Bulgars changed the political situation. Malamir or Presian may have seen a threat in the Serb consolidation, and opted to subjugate them in the midst of the conquest of Slav lands. Another reason might have been that the Byzantines wanted to divert attention in order to cope with the Slav Uprising in the Peloponnese, and so sent the Serbs to instigate the war.–ò–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è –∑–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–µ, p. 42‚Äî43 Presian invaded Serbian territory in 839. The invasion led to a 3-year war, in which Vlastimir was victorious; Presian was driven out of Serbian territory by Vlastimir's army. In addition to making no territorial gains, Presian suffered heavy losses due to the Serbian tactical advantage in the hills. The war ended with the death of Theophilos in 842, which released Vlastimir from his obligations to the Byzantine Empire. Presian died in 852, and was succeeded by his son Boris I.

It is also the name of a neighborhood and administrative district within the ward. The ward calls itself Setagaya City in English. Its official bird is the azure-winged magpie, its flower is the fringed orchid, and its tree is the Zelkova serrata. Setagaya has the largest population and second largest area (after ≈åta) of Tokyo's special wards. As of January 1, 2020, the ward has an estimated population of 939,099, and a population density of 16,177 persons per km¬≤ with the total area of 58.06 km¬≤. Geography Setagaya is located at the southwestern corner of the Tokyo's special wards and Tama River separates the boundary between Tokyo Metropolis and Kanagawa Prefecture. Residential population is among the highest in Tokyo as there are many residential neighbourhoods within Setagaya. Setagaya is served by various rail services providing frequent 2 to 3 minutes headway rush hour services to the busiest train terminals of Shinjuku and Shibuya as well as through service trains which continue travelling on to the Tokyo Metro lines providing direct access to the central commercial and business districts. Most rail lines run parallel from east to west and there are no north to south rail services within Setagaya, except for Setagaya Line light rail. The ward is divided into five districts. These are Setagaya, Kitazawa, Tamagawa, Kinuta and Karasuyama. The main ward office and municipal assembly (city hall) is located in Setagaya District, but other districts also have its own branch ward offices as a part of the administrative structure. Each branch offices provide almost identical services as the main office, but does not provide the services related to municipal assembly. Most of the land is in the Musashino Tableland. The parts along the Tama River to the south are comparatively low-lying. History The special ward of Setagaya was founded on March 15, 1947. During the Edo period, 42 villages occupied the area. With the abolition of the han system in 1871, the central and eastern portions became part of Tokyo Prefecture while the rest became part of Kanagawa Prefecture; in 1893, some areas were transferred to Tokyo Prefecture. With the establishment of Setagaya Ward (an ordinary ward) in the old Tokyo City in 1932, and further consolidation in 1936, Setagaya took its present boundaries. During the 1964 Summer Olympics, the district of Karasuyama-machi in Setagaya was part of the athletics marathon and 50 km walk event.1964 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 2. Part 2. p. 74.

Retrieved 10 April 2012.) was a Great Khan (Kanasubigi)–¢—ä—Ä–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏ –Ω–∞–¥–ø–∏—Å –Ω–∞ –∫–∞–Ω –û–º—É—Ä—Ç–∞–≥ of Bulgaria from 814 to 831. He is known as \\"the Builder\\". In the very beginning of his reign he signed a 30-year peace treaty with the neighboring Eastern Roman Empire which remained in force to the end of his life. Omurtag successfully coped with the aggressive policy of the Frankish Empire to take Bulgaria's north-western lands and suppressed the unrest among several Slavic tribes. He made administrative reforms which increased the power and the authority of the central government. His reign was marked with a strong development of Bulgarian architecture with a number of significant construction projects. Rise to the throne After the death of Khan Krum there was a short period of political instability in the country. Some sources mention that Bulgaria was ruled by three nobles - Dukum, Ditseng and Tsog - who were recorded as persecutors of the Christians in the Byzantine sources. Several theories exist about the events in that period. According to them, those three nobles were either Krum's generals with a major role in the government but without assuming the throne; or regents to the infant Omurtag. The historians usually accept as a compromise the view of Professor Vasil Gyuzelev that Omurtag succeeded his father after short disturbances in the government. Foreign policy =First years of Omurtag= The Bulgarian ruler Omurtag sends delegation to the Byzantine emperor. After the abrupt death of Khan Krum there were many Bulgarian troops in Thrace defending different strategic locations. The Byzantine Emperor Leo V the Armenian made use of the short crisis in the summer of 814 and led his troops against the Bulgarians. In the ensuing battle near the town of Burtodizos (probably the modern Babaeski) the Byzantines were victorious - Omurtag escaped the battlefield on his swift horse. However, the battle was not a decisive blow for the Bulgarians although it certainly had some effect. Madara, Bulgaria. Besides that assault the Byzantines took other precautions against the Bulgarians. In the beginning of 814 they sent emissaries to the Frankish ruler Louis the Pious to make an alliance against Bulgaria. It is unknown whether they reached an agreement but most probably the Frankish Emperor did not agree to any tangible actions. However, when the news for a possible alliance between the two empires reached Pliska, the Bulgarians decided to conclude a peace. Moreover, they needed to consolidate their authority in the newly conquered lands. The appearance of the Frankish state and the new stirring of the tribes in the steppes necessitated that the rear should be secured before further campaigning against the Byzantine Empire. Those considerations gave reason for Omurtag to conclude a 30-year peace treaty with the Byzantines in 815, which was partly inscribed on a surviving column found near the village of Seltsi, Shumen Province. According to that inscription the treaty specified: *the border in Thrace. It began on the Black Sea coast near Debelt, passed along the earth ditch Erkesiya, continued to the Makri Livada (in modern Haskovo Province) on the Maritsa river and from there to the Rhodope mountains but without including Plovdiv within Bulgaria's borders. *the issue with the Slavs which remained in Byzantium. The Bulgarians proposed to exchange the Byzantine captives for the Slavic population of Thrace. *the exchange of the other prisoners of war. Omurtag pursues Thomas the Slav. The two rulers had sworn to uphold the conditions of the treaty by each other's rites, which scandalized the Byzantine court. The treaty was very favourable for Bulgaria because the country needed peace. The army was exhausted, the capital Pliska was still in ruins after the invasion of Nicephorus I in 811 and the Byzantine Empire was no longer a serious threat for the Bulgarians. The treaty was honoured by both sides and was renewed after the accession of the new Byzantine Emperor Michael II to the throne in 820. In 821 Thomas the Slav rebelled against the Byzantine Emperor and laid siege to Constantinople to seize the Imperial throne for himself. Khan Omurtag sent an army to help Michael II put down the rebellion which attacked the rebels at the Battle of Kedouktos (winter 822 or spring 823). =Relations with the Frankish Empire= Bulgarian Empire during the reign of Omurtag In 818 the Slavic tribes of the Timoƒçani, Abodrites, and Braniƒçevci (who inhabited the lands along the middle Danube, former Avar domains) rebelled against the increasingly centralized Bulgarian suzerainty in the west and sought the support of the Frankish Emperor Louis the Pious. Between 824 and 826 Omurtag approached the Frankish court with an attempt to seek a diplomatic resolution of the problem. Failing to gain Frankish co-operation, Omurtag issued an ultimatum in 826 and in 827 sent a fleet along the Danube and the Drava, which restored Bulgarian control over portions of southeastern Pannonia. The Franks were defeated in several minor fights. After that short-term conflict the relations between the two countries improved and Omurtag replaced the local Slavic chiefs with his deputies. Similar events took place again in 829 with the same result. Those events were described in a memorial inscription for the zera-tarkhan Onegavon who drowned in the Tisza river. Furthermore, there was a large buffer zone between the Danube and the Tisza called Kaz√°rorsz√°g (inhabited by certain \\"Cozar\\" people) which separated the two states. The problems in that case were the attempts of several Slavic tribes to gain more autonomy which was at variance to the Bulgarian policy of centralization and incorporation of the Slavs. Another memorial inscription, for kopan Okorsis who drowned in the Dneper, testifies to military activities along the north-eastern border dating as early as 824. However, it is not certain whom the Bulgarians fought. It is usually agreed that it was the Magyars, but recently the opinion of Professor Ivan Bozhilov that the war was against the Khazars has become increasingly popular. Although there is no direct evidence for the outcome of the war, it can be assumed that it ended with a Bulgarian victory due to the swift and energetic precautions taken by Omurtag. Internal policy The long peace was a favourable time for an active internal policy for the further consolidation of the forming Bulgarian Nation, removal of many internal threats to improve stability, and intensive building. =Administration= Omurtag orders the murder of Christians After the unsuccessful attempts of several Slavic chiefs to secede from Bulgaria Omurtag conclusively eliminated the autonomy of the Slavic tribes in the vast country. He made an administrative reform and divided the state into large provinces called comitati (singular comitat) whose governors were directly appointed by the Kanasubigi and had both military and civil authority. The comitati were further divided into smaller regions called zhupi (singular zhupa). The area around the capital had a special status. The Army was integrated and became unified; it no longer relied on separate Slav infantry and Bulgar cavalry. The importance of Kanasubigi's first ministers, the kavkhan and the ichirgu-boil grew. As a result, from the reforms Bulgaria was consolidated and further centralized. =Building activity= At home Omurtag undertook large-scale construction, intended to both restore his capital Pliska, which had been destroyed by the Byzantines in 811, and to foster the development of a number of regional centers, palaces, and fortifications. His construction activities contributed greatly to the development of the Pliska-Preslav culture. Many sources (e.g., the Chatalar and Tarnovo inscriptions) and memorial inscriptions are preserved, which testify to the reconstruction of Pliska, the building of a new palace with a large throne room, and a temple of Tangra. There was an alley of stone columns with the names of the conquered towns in Thrace. A number of palaces and fortresses were built along the Danube, as well as the Khan's residences in Tarnovo and Chepelare. The construction of those projects required a strong economy, which Bulgaria obviously possessed. =Persecution of the Christians= Bulgar soldiers slaughter Christians, from the Menologion of Basil II, 10th century. Omurtag pursued a policy of repression against Christians, particularly the Byzantine prisoners of war settled by his father Krum in Bulgaria (mostly north of the Danube). The Menologion of Basil II glorifies Emperor Basil II, showing him as a warrior defending Orthodox Christendom against the Bulgarian Empire, whose attacks on Christians are graphically illustrated. Even figures like the archangels were depicted in military guise by the painters. The persecution may have been motivated in part by the Byzantine invasion of 811 or with the beginning of Christian proselytizing by members of the substantial captive population. In connection with these policies, Omurtag disinherited his eldest son Enravota (Voin or Boyan), who had shown himself sympathetic to Christianity. Inferences about Omurtag's policy towards the Slavs based on his naming Slavic tribes among his enemies in one inscription or on the alleged Slavic names of his three sons are overly speculative. The 17th century Volga Bulgar compilation Ja'far Tarikh (a work of disputed authenticity) represents Amurtag or Yomyrƒçak (i.e., Omurtag) as the son of Korym (i.e., Krum).

During his reign the Bulgarian territory doubled in size, spreading from the middle Danube to the Dnieper and from Odrin to the Tatra Mountains.

His background and the surroundings of his accession are unknown. It has been speculated that Krum might have been a descendant of the old Bulgar royal house of Kubrat. The name Krum is of Iranian origin.Scythian roots of the Bulgar religion, Tsvetelin Stepanov, page 103 =Establishment of new borders= Around 805, Krum defeated the Avar Khaganate to destroy the remainder of the Avars and to restore Bulgar authority in Ongal again, the traditional Bulgar name for the area north of the Danube across the Carpathians covering Transylvania and along the Danube into eastern Pannonia. This resulted in the establishment of a common border between the Frankish Empire and Bulgaria, which would have important repercussions for the policy of Krum's successors. =Conflict with Nikephoros I= nobles as a servant (right) brings the skull of Nikephoros I, fashioned into a drinking cup, full of wine. Krum engaged in a policy of territorial expansion. In 807 Bulgarian forces defeated the Byzantine army in the Struma valley. In 809 Krum besieged and forced the surrender of Serdica, slaughtering the garrison of 6,000 despite a guarantee of safe conduct. This victory provoked Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros I to settle Anatolian populations along the frontier to protect it and to attempt to retake and refortify Serdica, although this enterprise failed. In early 811, Nikephoros I undertook a massive expedition against Bulgaria, advancing to Marcellae (near Karnobat). Here Krum attempted to negotiate on July 11, 811, but Nikephoros was determined to continue with his plunder. His army somehow avoided Bulgarian ambushes in the Balkan Mountains and made its way into Moesia. They managed to take over Pliska on July 20, as only a small, hastily assembled army was in their way. Here Nikephoros helped himself to the treasures of the Bulgarians while setting the city afire and turning his army on the population. A new diplomatic initiative from Krum was rebuffed. The chronicle of the 12th-century patriarch of the Syrian Jacobites, Michael the Syrian, describes the brutalities and atrocities of Nikephoros: \\"Nikephoros, emperor of the Byzantine empire, walked into the Bulgarians' land: he was victorious and killed great number of them. He reached their capital, seized it and devastated it. His savagery went to the point that he ordered to bring their small children, got them tied down on earth and made thresh grain stones to smash them.\\" Battle at VƒÉrbitsa Pass (811). While Nikephoros I and his army pillaged and plundered the Bulgarian capital, Krum mobilized as many soldiers as possible, giving weapons even to peasants and women. This army was assembled in the mountain passes to intercept the Byzantines as they returned to Constantinople. At dawn on July 26, the Bulgarians managed to trap the retreating Nikephoros in the VƒÉrbica pass. The Byzantine army was wiped out in the ensuing battle and Nikephoros was killed, while his son Staurakios was carried to safety by the imperial bodyguard after receiving a paralyzing wound to the neck. It is said that Krum had the Emperor's skull lined with silver and used it as a drinking cup. =Conflict with Michael I Rangabe= Staurakios was forced to abdicate after a brief reign (he died from his wound in 812), and he was succeeded by his brother-in-law Michael I Rangabe. In 812 Krum invaded Byzantine Thrace, taking Develt and scaring the population of nearby fortresses to flee towards Constantinople. From this position of strength, Krum offered a return to the peace treaty of 716. Unwilling to compromise from a position of weakness, the new Emperor Michael I refused to accept the proposal, ostensibly opposing the clause for exchange of deserters. To apply more pressure on the Emperor, Krum besieged and captured Mesembria (Nesebar) in the autumn of 812. Battle at Versinikia (813). In February 813 the Bulgarians raided Thrace but were repelled by the Emperor's forces. Encouraged by this success, Michael I summoned troops from the entire Byzantine Empire and headed north, hoping for a decisive victory. Krum led his army south towards Adrianople and pitched camp near Versinikia. Michael I lined up his army against the Bulgarians, but neither side initiated an attack for two weeks. Finally, on June 22, 813, the Byzantines attacked but were immediately turned to flight. With Krum's cavalry in pursuit, the rout of Michael I was complete, and Krum advanced on Constantinople, which he besieged by land. Discredited, Michael was forced to abdicate and become a monk -- the third Byzantine Emperor forced to give up the throne by Krum in as many years. =Conflict with Leo V the Armenian= The new emperor, Leo V the Armenian, offered to negotiate and arranged for a meeting with Krum. As Krum arrived, he was ambushed by Byzantine archers and was wounded as he made his escape. Furious, Krum ravaged the environs of Constantinople and headed home, capturing Adrianople en route, transporting its inhabitants (including the parents of the future Emperor Basil I) across the Danube. In spite of the approach of winter, Krum took advantage of good weather to send a force of 30,000 into Thrace, capturing Arkadioupolis (L√ºleburgaz) and carrying off 50,000 captives to the Bulgarian lands across the Danube. The loot from Thrace was used to enrich Krum and his nobility and included architectural elements utilized in the reconstruction of Pliska, perhaps largely by captured Byzantine artisans. Krum spent the winter preparing for a major attack on Constantinople, where rumor reported the assemblage of an extensive siege park to be transported on 5,000 carts. He died before he set out, however, on April 13, 814, and he was succeeded by his son Omurtag. Legacy Bulgaria under Khan Krum (new territories gained under his rule are in yellow) Krum was remembered for instituting the first known written Bulgarian law code, which ensured subsidies to beggars and state protection to all poor Bulgarians. Drinking, slander, and robbery were severely punished. Through his laws he became known as a strict but just ruler, bringing Slavs and Bulgars into a centralized state. Novels have been written on his life, such as by Dmityar Mantov (1973), and Ivan Bogdanov (1990).

The ward refers to itself as Suginami City in English. As of April 1, 2017, Suginami has an estimated population of 562,065, and a population density of 16,502 persons per km2. The total area is 34.06 km2. Geography Suginami occupies the western part of the ward area of Tokyo. Its neighbors include these special wards: to the east, Shibuya and Nakano; to the north, Nerima; and to the south, Setagaya. Its western neighbors are the cities of Mitaka and Musashino. The Kanda River passes through Suginami. The Zenpukuji river originates from Zenpukuji Park in western Suginami, and the My≈çsh≈çji River originates in My≈çsh≈çji Park, to the north of Ogikubo station. History The name Suginami dates back to the early Edo period and is a shortened version of Suginamiki (\\"avenue of cedars‚Äù). This name came about when an early land baron, Lord Tadayoshi Okabe, planted a row of cedar trees to mark the bounds of his property. The ward was founded on March 15, 1947. In 1970, 40 high school students in the area were exposed to photochemical smog and required hospitalization. The incident attracted national attention and increased awareness of the dangers of pollution.

In 1954, local housewives launched the \\"Suginami Appeal\\" against nuclear weapons, a petition that spread nationwide and ultimately collected 20 million signatures. More recently in 2005, Suginami became part of Japan's fight against nationalist textbook revisionism when residents petitioned Tokyo's courts to prevent the adoption of a controversial textbook published by Fusosha Publishing which claimed to justify Japanese actions during World War II. The ward has also passed an ordinance placing limits on the installation of security cameras. To combat burglaries, which reached a record number of 1,710 in 2002, the ward created an unconventional anti-crime program called Operation Flower. The ward urged residents to plant flowers facing the street, with the long-term goal of increasing neighborhood watchfulness (necessitated by watering and otherwise attending to the plants). In addition, 9,600 volunteers were recruited for neighborhood safety patrols, 200 security cameras were placed at crime- vulnerable areas, and a daily email update was created for residents. Subsequent to the start of the program, burglaries were down 80% to 390 in 2008. As of 2006, the mayor of Suginami is Hiroshi Yamada. Suginami refused to connect to Japan's Residents Basic Registry Network. As of 2005, it is implementing a measure to make registry optional.

It is one of the eight central wards of the Tokyo Metropolitan area. Located in the northern area of Tokyo, Toshima is bordered by the wards of Nerima, Itabashi, and Kita in the north, and Nakano, Shinjuku and Bunkyo in the south. The ward was founded on March 15, 1947, and reached a peak resident population of 370,000 in 1965. The population has continued to decline and as of May 1, 2015, the ward had an estimated population of 298,250, with a population density of 22,920 persons per km¬≤. During the day the population swells with commuters, resulting in a daytime population of around 378,475. The total land area of Toshima is 13.01 km¬≤, sitting on a moderate plateau with a difference of 28 m between the ward's highest and lowest points. Approximately 47% of Toshima's land is residential, and 20% is commercial and public areas. Although Toshima is a ward, it is referred to as a city. The ward offices are located in Ikebukuro, which is also the commercial and entertainment center of Toshima. With a non-Japanese population of 19,868, or 7.42% of the total, Toshima is one of the most international wards in Tokyo. Of the foreign population, 56% is of Chinese descent, 20% is of Korean descent, with the rest being of primarily Filipino and European descent. History Toshima was formed in 1932 by the merger of four towns, Sugamoch≈ç, Nishi-sugamoch≈ç, Takadach≈ç, and Nagasakich≈ç, bordered by the quickly expanding former city of Tokyo. The area evolved from a suburban agricultural district in the Edo period to the urban commercial center that it is today. The growth was fueled by the construction of various rail lines built in the Meiji and Taish≈ç periods. The former Somei village, now part of Toshima, was a center of plant nurseries, and is the birthplace of the Somei Yoshino, Japan's most popular variety of sakura (cherry blossom tree). The variety was developed at the end of the Edo period.  Politics and government  Toshima ward office Toshima is run by a city assembly of 36 elected members. The current mayor is Yukio Takano, an independent backed by all major parties except the Japanese Communist Party. In April 2011, Taiga Ishikawa was elected to the Toshima assembly, becoming the first openly gay man to win an election in Japanese history.

History The area was mainly agricultural in the Edo period. In 1651, Kozukappara, the Tokugawa's largest execution ground (now located next to Minami-Senju station), was built. Beginning in the Meiji era, the area became industrial as factories were built on the water front. In 1932, it became one of the 35 wards of Tokyo City. Tokyo #10-B Prisoner of War Camp On 1 July 1944, during World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army established a Prisoner of War camp named #20-B, on the grounds nearby Hashiba Bridge, Minami-Senju, Arakawa, at the current day location with the address of 3-41 Minami-Senju, Arakawa. The camp was renamed to #10-B, in August 1945. The prisoners of the camp were rescued in September 1945. At the time, there were 256 prisoners of war (87 British, 64 American, 55 Canadian and 50 Dutch) held at the camp. Two prisoners of war died during their imprisonment.

The global population is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2014. The European population is restricted to the Canary Islands and has been assessed as Near Threatened in 2015. It is dull brown with black markings on the wings, a greyish neck and a black ruff along the side of the neck. Males are larger and heavier than females. The houbara bustard formerly included MacQueen's bustard, which is native to Asia. Description The houbara bustard is a small to mid-sized bustard. It measures in length and spans across the wings. It is brown above and white below, with a black stripe down the sides of its neck. In flight, the long wings show large areas of black and brown on the flight feathers. It is slightly smaller and darker than MacQueen's bustard. The sexes are similar, but the female, at tall, is rather smaller and greyer above than the male, at tall. The body mass is in males and in females.CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . Taxonomy Psophia undulata was the scientific name proposed by Joseph Franz von Jacquin in 1784 who described a houbara brought from Tripoli to Vienna's Tiergarten Sch√∂nbrunn. Otis macqueenii was proposed by John Edward Gray in 1832 for a bustard from India drawn by Thomas Hardwicke. The African houbara was subordinated to the genus Chlamydotis by Ren√© Lesson in 1839. Houbara fuertaventurae was proposed by Walter Rothschild and Ernst Hartert in 1894 for a houbara from Fuerteventura island. MacQueen's bustard was long regarded a subspecies of the African houbara. It was proposed as a distinct species in 2003 because of differences in plumage, vocalizations and courtship behaviour. The British Ornithologists' Union's Taxonomic Records Committee's decision to accept this split has been questioned on the grounds that the differences in the male courtship displays may be functionally trivial, and would not prevent interbreeding, whereas a difference in a pre-copulation display would indicate that the two are separate species. The committee responded to this scepticism, by explaining that there are differences in both courtship and pre-copulation displays. = Phylogeny = Canarian houbara in Lanzarote, Canary Islands Results of analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences of 73 Chlamydotis samples indicates that the houbara bustard and MacQueen's bustard genetically diverged around 430,000 years ago from a common ancestor. The divergence between the African and Canarian houbara was estimated at around 20,000 to 25,000 years ago. Distribution and habitat The houbara bustard is found in North Africa west of the Nile, mainly in the western part of the Sahara desert region in Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. Some old records exist from Sudan as well. A small population is found in the Canary Islands. The Asian houbara or MacQueen's bustard which was earlier included in this species occurs east of the Sinai Peninsula. The North African species is sedentary unlike the migratory northern populations of MacQueen's bustards. The subspecies fuertaventurae of the Canary Islands is highly restricted and endangered. A 1997 survey found a total population of about 500 birds. Behaviour and ecology =Breeding= Houbara bustard egg in the collection of the Museum Wiesbaden Like other bustards, this species has a flamboyant display raising the white feathers of the head and neck and withdrawing the head. Two to four eggs are laid on the ground. It hardly ever uses its voice. =Feeding= This species is omnivorous, taking seeds, insects and other small creatures. Threats In North Africa, the houbara bustard is hunted by falconers and by hunters with guns. The populations declined in the two decades before 2004, but have been increasing since. Conservation  The International Fund for Houbara Conservation is the global leader in Houbara bustard conservation. A global conservation strategy was developed and implemented over the past forty years with the objective of ensuring the species has a sustainable future in the wild through effective and appropriate conservation programmes and management plans. Since 1995, the conservation strategy adopted consists of an integrated approach combining sound ecology, protection measures in the wild, conservation breeding, and effective reinforcement programmes. The IHFC was created in 2006 to further the original programme by managing international assets and securing partnerships across the range of the houbara, which encourage sustainable practices to ensure the species‚Äô conservation. The Houbara conservation programme is supported by the government of Abu Dhabi. A multi-faceted Houbara conservation strategy has established breeding centers in the UAE (The National Avian Research Center and The Sheik Khalifa Houbara Breeding Center), Morocco (Emirates Center for Wildlife Propagation) and Kazakhstan (The Sheik Khalifa Houbara Breeding Center) to captive-breed Houbara and increase wild populations of the bird in its natural habitat across entire species range. In 2019, the International Fund for Houbara Conservation bred 484,351 Houbara and released more than 343,428 Houbara into the wild. The International Foundation for Conservation and Development of Wildlife (IFCDW) is a major conservation and breeding project established with funds from Prince Sultan Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud and based near Agadir, Morocco. The centre releases captive bred populations to boost wild populations.

The hunchback at center is less than tall. An archetypical baby-face figurine from Las Bocas. Olmec figurines are archetypical figurines produced by the Formative Period inhabitants of Mesoamerica. While not all of these figurines were produced in the Olmec heartland, they bear the hallmarks and motifs of Olmec culture. While the extent of Olmec control over the areas beyond their heartland is not yet known, Formative Period figurines with Olmec motifs were widespread in the centuries from 1000 to 500 BC, showing a consistency of style and subject throughout nearly all of Mesoamerica. These figurines are usually found in household refuse, ancient construction fill, and, outside the Olmec heartland, graves. However, many Olmec-style figurines, particularly those labelled as Las Bocas- or Xochipala-style, were recovered by looters and are therefore without provenance. The vast majority of figurines are simple in design, often nude or with a minimum of clothing, and made of local terracotta. Most of these recoveries are mere fragments: a head, arm, torso, or a leg.Castro-Leal, p. 143 . It is thought, based on wooden busts recovered from the water-logged El Manati site, that figurines were also carved from wood, but, if so, none have survived. More durable and better known by the general public are those figurines carved, usually with a degree of skill, from jade, serpentine, greenstone, basalt, and other minerals and stones. Baby-face figurines The \\"baby-face\\" figurine is a unique marker of Olmec culture, consistently found in sites that show Olmec influence,Scott, p. 268. although they seem to be confined to the early Olmec period and are largely absent, for example, in La Venta.Coe (1989), p. 77. These ceramic figurines are easily recognized by the chubby body, the baby-like jowly face, downturned mouth, and the puffy slit-like eyes. The head is slightly pear- shaped, likely due to artificial cranial deformation.Pohorilenko, p. 121. They often wear a tight-fitting helmet not dissimilar to those worn by the Olmec colossal heads.Pohorilenko, p. 121 . Baby-face figurines are usually naked, but without genitalia.Blomster (1998), p. 311, says \\"Sex or gender do not appear to be indicated on any of these objects.\\". Their bodies are rarely rendered with the detail shown on their faces. Also called \\"hollow babies\\", these figurines are generally from highBlomster (2002), p. 173. and feature a highly burnished white- or cream-slip. They are only rarely found in archaeological context.Blomster (1998). Archaeologist Jeffrey Blomster divides baby-face figurines into two groups based on several features. Among the many distinguishing factors, Group 1 figurines more closely mirror the characteristics of Gulf Coast Olmec artifacts. Group 2 figurines are also slimmer than those of Group 1, lacking the jowly face or fleshy body, and their bodies are larger in proportion to their heads.Blomster (2002). Given the sheer numbers of baby-face figurines unearthed, they undoubtedly fulfilled some special role in the Olmec culture. What they represented, however, is not known. Michael Coe, says \\"One of the great enigmas in Olmec iconography is the nature and meaning of the large, hollow, whiteware babies\\".Coe (1989), p. 77. An \\"elongated man\\" figurine, dark green serpentine. Inlays, since lost, once animated the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.Bradley (2005) p. 25. Elongated man Another common figurine style features standing figurines in a stiff artificial pose and characterized by their thin limbs, elongated, bald, flat- topped heads, almond-shaped eyes, and downturned mouths. The figurines' legs are usually separated, often straight, sometimes bent. Toes and fingers, if shown at all, are frequently represented by lines. It has been theorized that the elongated, flat-topped heads are reflective of the practice of artificial cranial deformation, as found in the Tlatilco burials of the same period or among the Maya of a later era.Diehl, p. 122. No direct evidence of this practice has been found in the Olmec heartland, however. The ears often have small holes for ear flares or other ornaments. These figurines may have therefore once worn earrings and even clothes made of perishable materials. It has been proposed that these figurines had multiple outfits for different ritual occasions ‚Äì as Richard Diehl puts it, \\"a pre-Columbian version of Barbie's Ken\\".Diehl, p. 122. These figurines are usually carved from jade and well under in height. For another example, see this Commons photo. =Offering 4 at La Venta= At the La Venta archaeological site, archaeologists found what they subsequently named \\"Offering 4\\". These figurines had been ritually buried in a deep, narrow hole, and covered over with three layers of colored clay. At some point after the original burial, someone dug a small hole down just to the level of their heads and then refilled it.Pool, p. 164, who refers to Drucker, Heizer, and Squier (1959) Excavations at La Venta, Tabasco, Smithsonian. Offering 4 consists of sixteen male figurines positioned in a semicircle in front of six jade celts, perhaps representing stelae or basalt columns. Two of the figurines were made from jade, thirteen from serpentine, and one of reddish granite. This granite figurine one was positioned with its back to the celts, facing the others. All of the figurines had similar classic Olmec features including bald elongated heads. They had small holes for earrings, their legs were slightly bent, and they were undecorated ‚Äì unusual if the figurines were gods or deities ‚Äì but instead covered with cinnabar.Pool, p. 164. Interpretations abound. Perhaps this particular formation represents a council of some sort‚Äîthe fifteen other figurines seem to be listening to the red granite one, with the celts forming a backdrop. One of the most striking offerings found at La Venta, the celts in Offering Number 4, depict a person with a ceremonial headdress ‚Äúflying‚Äù and also the maize deity. There appears to be a definite symbolic link here, but it is unclear whether it is tied to the Olmec rudimentary writing system.Xu 1998 To the red granite figurine's right, there seems be a line of three figurines filing past him. Another researcher has suggested that the granite figure is an initiate. As the name implies, Offering 4 is one of many ritual offerings uncovered at La Venta, including the four Massive Offerings and four mosaics. Why such works would be buried continues to generate much speculation. A small jade were-jaguar figurine. Stand-alone were-jaguar figurines are rare - most were- jaguar figurines show a were-jaguar baby accompanied by a human adult. Height: . \\"Were-jaguar\\" motif The so-called were-jaguar motif runs through much of Olmec art, from the smallest jade to some of the largest basalt statues. The motif is found inscribed on celts, votive axes, masks, and on \\"elongated man\\" figurines. Also termed, somewhat more neutrally, the \\"composite anthropomorph\\"Porhilenko. or the \\"rain baby\\",Miller & Taube. Joralemon (1996) similarly refers to this combination of features as the \\"storm god\\". the were- jaguar's body, if shown, is baby- or childlike. Its eyes are almond-shaped ‚Äì or occasionally slit-like.Miller & Taube, p. 126. Its nose is human. Its downturned mouth is open, as if in mid-squall. The upper lip is everted and toothless gums are often visible. Olmec motifs associated with the were-jaguar include a cleft on the head or headdress, a headband, and cross-bars.Miller & Taube, p. 126. Most were-jaguar figurines show an inert were-jaguar baby being held by an adult. Olmec eagle transformation figure, 10th‚Äì6th century BC Jade (albite), with cinnabar. Height: . Transformation figures Many other Olmec figurines combined human and animal features, including this were-eagle (left). Although figurines showing such combinations of features are generally termed \\"transformation figures\\", some researchers argue that they represent humans in animal masks or animal suits, while others state that they likely represent shamans.Diehl, p. 106. This transformation figure displays bat-like features. Most common, however, is the jaguar transformation figurine (see Commons photo), which show a wide variety of styles, ranging from human-like figurines to those that are almost completely jaguar, and several where the subject appears to be in a stage of transformation.Miller & Taube state that the jaguar is the primary subject of transformation figures, p. 103. Naturalistic figurines Despite the many stylised figurines, Olmec-period artisans and artist also portrayed humans naturalistically with \\"a most extraordinary realistic technique\\".Kubler, p. 12. The lead photo for this article shows a number of tiny naturalistic figurines. A jade fetal-style figurine from Guerrero, Mexico. Height: . Dwarf or fetal-style figurines Another pervasive Olmec figurine type features crouching figurines with thin bodies and over-large oval heads with small noses and receding chins.Pohorilenko, p. 122. Some researchers such as Miguel Covarrubias generally characterise these figurines as \\"dwarfs\\".Covarrubias, p. 64. Pohorilenko, p. 122, also describes these crouching figurines as dwarfs. many others, also including Covarrubias, see evidence of \\"what looks like pre-natal posture\\".Covarrubias, p. 57. In a 1999 article, Carolyn Tate and Gordon Bendersky analysed head-to-body ratios and concluded that these figurines are naturalistic sculptures of fetuses, and discuss the possibility of infanticide and infant sacrifice.Tate & Bendersky.

Merchant ship names often contain the word maru at the end (meaning circle), while warships are never named after people, but rather after objects such as mountains, islands, weather phenomena, or animals.  Merchant ships  The word is often attached to Japanese ship names. The first ship known to follow this practice was the Nippon Maru, flagship of daimy≈ç Toyotomi Hideyoshi's 16th century fleet. Several theories purport to explain this practice: *The most common is that ships were thought of as floating castles, and the word referred to the defensive \\"circles\\" or maru that protected the castle. *The suffix -maru is often applied to words representing something beloved, and sailors applied this suffix to their ships. *The term maru is used in divination and represents perfection or completeness, or the ship as \\"a small world of its own\\". *The myth of Hakudo Maru, a celestial being that came to earth and taught humans how to build ships. It is said that the name maru is attached to a ship to secure celestial protection for itself as it travels. *For the past few centuries, only non-warships bore the -maru ending. Its use was intended as a good hope naming convention that would allow a ship to leave port, travel the world, and return safely to home port: hence the complete circle or \\"round trip\\" arriving back at its origin unhurt. *\\"Hinomaru\\", or \\"sun-disc\\", is a name often applied to the national flag of Japan. Today many commercial and private ships are still named using this convention. Warships = Early conventions = When the Imperial Japanese Navy was formed, the Ministry of the Navy submitted potential ship names to the Emperor for approval. During the early years ships were often donated by the Shogunate or Japanese clans and the original clan names were kept. In 1891 the procedure was changed due to changes in the government structure. Two ship names were submitted by the Minister of the Navy to the Lord Chamberlain who then presented the choices to the Emperor. The Emperor could either pick one of the suggested names or one of his own devising. Ships captured during the First Sino-Japanese War kept their original names but with Japanese pronunciation. For example, the Chinese battleship Chen Yuan became Chin'en in Japanese service. In 1876 the Minister of the Navy was given the authority to choose the names of torpedo boats without imperial approval. In 1902 the authority to name destroyers was delegated to the Minister of the Navy as well. In 1895 a proposal was made by the Minister of the Navy in an attempt to establish some standard. He proposed that battleships and cruisers be named for provinces or shrines dedicated to protecting Japan, that names of other warships be selected from the names for Japan or provinces. Ships captured during the Russo-Japanese War were renamed with Japanese names. Some of these vessels were given names related to where they were captured or some other aspect of the war, such as the month of capture. Some Russian ships were given Japanese names that were phonetically similar to their original Russian names (example: Angara became Anegawa). In 1921 the Minister of the Navy was given authority to name all ships except battleships, battlecruisers, and cruisers. In any event the Navy had to report the new name to the Emperor immediately. = Establishment of ship naming conventions 1905 = On 23 April 1905, Naval Minister Gonbee Yamamoto reported to the throne about a new ship naming standard. It was decided on 1 August 1905. *Battleship: provinces, or alternate names of Japan *First class cruiser (and over 7,500 tons displacement): mountains *Second class cruiser (and over 3,500 tons displacement -- less than 7,500 tons displacement): put the initial Ni („Å´) *Third class cruiser (less than 3,500 tons displacement): put the initial Ha („ÅØ) *Other ship names: They were named voluntarily by Naval Minister. However, second class and third class cruisers ended up with river names because it became complicated. It passed through some changes afterwards, the broad categories of names are given here, with examples, however, if the name is the succession to a ship's name, it is excluded from following contents. *Aircraft carriers -- special namesJACAR, C13071953800, p. 25, Report to the throne \\"Nomenclature of aircraft carrier\\", 18 December 1933, Minister of the Navy of Japan.

For example, Akagi is probably perceived as \\"red castle\\" by Japanese about as often as Philadelphia is perceived as the \\"city of brotherly love\\" by Americans. There is a tendency for translations of Japanese names to be somewhat fanciful. For example, Sh≈çkaku is often translated as \\"crane flying in heaven\\", but \\"flying crane\\" or \\"soaring crane\\" is a more accurate translation. Another fanciful translation is \\"land of divine mulberry trees\\" for Fus≈ç ‚Äî fuso was a Chinese name for a mythical tree supposed to grow to the east, hence an old poetic word for Japan. In World War II, the composition of the Japanese Navy was a military secret. US Naval Intelligence built up knowledge of enemy ships through photographic reconnaissance, interrogation of prisoners, and signal interception. Inevitably there were mistakes and misinterpretations; some of these have been repeated in post-war accounts that rely on US Navy documents. For example, a prisoner of war after the battle of Midway reported the existence of an aircraft carrier named Hayataka. This was a misreading of the characters ÈöºÈ∑π in kun-yomi, while they in this case are properly read in on- yomi as Juny≈ç. Accordingly, many US documents refer to the carrier as Hayataka or its class as the Hayataka class.

It was formerly included as a subspecies of the Eurasian stone-curlew. The Eurasian stone-curlew, Eurasian thick-knee, or simply stone-curlew (Burhinus oedicnemus) is a northern species of the Burhinidae (stone-curlew) bird family. Etymology The genus name Burhinus comes from the Greek ', ox, and ', nose. The species name oedicnemus comes from the Greek , to swell, and , the shin or leg, referring to the bird's prominent tibiotarsal joints, which also give it the common name of \\"thick- knee\\". This is an abbreviated form of Pennant's 1776 coinage \\"thick kneed bustard\\". The name \\"stone curlew\\" was first recorded by Francis Willughby in 1667 as a \\"third sort of Godwit, which in Cornwall they call the Stone-Curlew, differing from the precedent in that it hath a much shorter and slenderer Bill than either of them\\". It derives from the bird's nocturnal calls sounding like the unrelated Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata and its preference for barren stony heaths. In his Bird Watching (1901) Edmund Selous uses the name \\"great or Norfolk plover\\" (≈ídicnemus Crepitans)., p. 4, 6. Description It is a fairly large wader though is mid-sized by the standards of its family. Length ranges from , wingspan from and weight from . with a strong yellow and black beak, large yellow eyes (which give it a \\"reptilian\\", or \\"goggle-eyed\\" appearance), and cryptic plumage. The bird is striking in flight, with black and white wing markings. Habits Museum Wiesbaden collection Despite being classed as a wader, this species prefers dry open habitats with some bare ground. It is largely nocturnal, particularly when singing its loud wailing songs, which are reminiscent of that of curlews. Food consists of insects and other small invertebrates, and occasionally small reptiles, frogs and rodents. It lays 2‚Äì3 eggs in a narrow scrape in the ground. Range and status The Eurasian stone curlew occurs throughout Europe, north Africa and southwestern Asia. It is a summer migrant in the more temperate European and Asian parts of its range, wintering in Africa. Although the species is of Least Concern, some populations are showing declines due to agricultural intensification. For example, a French population has declined with 26% over 14 years. Subspecies There are five subspecies of Burhinus oedicnemus: The Indian stone-curlew Burhinus indicus was previously considered a subspecies. * Burhinus oedicnemus distinctus (Bannerman, 1914) ‚Äì Found on the central and western Canary Islands * B. o. harterti Vaurie, 1963 ‚Äì Found from west Kazakhstan to Pakistan and northwestern India * B. o. insularum (Sassi, 1908) ‚Äì Found on the eastern Canary Islands * B. o. oedicnemus (Linnaeus, 1758) ‚Äì Found in western and southern Europe to the Balkans, Ukraine and Caucasus * B. o. saharae (Reichenow, 1894) ‚Äì Found in northern Africa and the Mediterranean islands to Iraq and Iran References External links Ageing and sexing (PDF; 4.7 MB) by Javier Blasco-Zumeta & Gerd-Michael Heinze  Eurasian stone curlew Category:Birds of Eurasia Category:Birds of North Africa Category:Birds of the Canary Islands Eurasian stone curlew Eurasian stone curlew ","title":"Eurasian stone-curlew"},{"id":"336024","text":"The internal affairs refers to a division of a law enforcement agency that investigates incidents and possible suspicions of law-breaking and professional misconduct attributed to officers on the force. It is thus a mechanism of limited self-governance, \\"a police force policing itself\\". In different systems, internal affairs can go by other names such as internal investigations division (usually referred to as IID), professional standards, inspectorate general, Office of Professional Responsibility, internal review board, or similar. Emblem of the Internal Affairs Unit, National Police Corps (Spain) Due to the sensitive nature of this responsibility, in many departments, officers employed in an internal affairs unit are not in a detective command but report directly to the agency's chief, or to a board of civilian police commissioners. Internal affairs investigators are bound by stringent rules when conducting their investigations. In California, the Peace Officers Bill of Rights (POBR) is a mandated set of rules found in the Government Code.Text of \\"Peace Officers Bill of Rights\\" - Peace Officers Research Association of California (PORAC) Function The internal affairs function is not an enforcement function, but rather a policing function that works to report only.Kelly, S.F. (2003). Internal Affairs. FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, 72(7), 1. The concept of internal affairs is very broad and unique to each police department.Hein, J. (2013). Inside internal affairs: An in depth look at the people, process, & politics. Flushing, NY: Looseleaf Law Publications. However, the sole purpose to having an internal affairs unit is to investigate and find the truth to what occurred when an officer is accused of misconduct. An investigation can also give insight on a policy itself that may have issues. Investigations The circumstances of the complaint determine who will be investigating the complaint. The investigation of alleged misconduct by police officers can be conducted by the internal affairs unit, an executive police officer, or an outside agency. In the Salt Lake City Police Department, the Civilian Review Board will also investigate the complaint, but they will do so independently. When the investigation begins, everything is documented and all employees, complainants, and witnesses are interviewed. Any physical evidence is analyzed and past behaviors of the officer in question are reviewed. Dispatch tapes, police reports, tickets, audio, and videotapes are all reviewed if available. Many controversies arise because an officer investigating police misconduct may show favoritism and/or hold grudges particularly when a single officer is conducting the investigation. Some departments hire uninvolved officers or include another department or a special unit to conduct the investigation. = Small agencies = Larger agencies have the resources to have separate units for internal affairs, but smaller agencies ‚Äì which do not have the luxury ‚Äì are more common, with 87% of police departments in the United States employing 25 or fewer sworn officers. Smaller agencies that do not have sufficient resources may have the executive officer, the accused's supervisor, or another police department conduct an investigation. The state police may also be asked to investigate criminal behavior, but they do not deal in minor misconduct or rule violation cases. However, allowing another department to investigate can result in lower morale among the officers because it can appear as an admission that the department cannot handle their own affairs.  Civilian review board  Several police departments in the USA have been compelled to institute citizen review or investigation of police misconduct complaints in response to community perception that internal affairs investigations are biased in favor of police officers. For example, San Francisco, California, has its Office of Citizen Complaints, created by voter initiative in 1983, in which citizens who have never been members of the San Francisco Police Department investigate complaints of police misconduct filed against members of the San Francisco Police Department. Washington, DC, has a similar office, created in 1999, known as the Office of Police Complaints.D.C. Office of Police Complaints In the state of Utah, the Internal Affairs Division must properly file a complaint before the committee can officially investigate. Complaints involving police misuse of force will be brought to the Civilian Review Board, but citizens can request the committee to investigate any other issues of misconduct.Kunz, C. \\"Management Services Bureau\\".

Philadelphia's Joseph Horn (1861‚Äì1941) and German-born, New Orleans-raised Frank Hardart (1850‚Äì1918) opened their first restaurant together in Philadelphia, on December 22, 1888. The small (11 x 17 foot) lunchroom at 39 South Thirteenth Street had no tables, only a counter with 15 stools. The location had housed the print shop of Dunlap & Claypoole, printers to the American Congress and George Washington. By introducing Philadelphia to New Orleans-style coffee (blended with chicory), which Hardart promoted as their \\"gilt-edge\\" brew, they made their tiny luncheonette a local attraction. News of the coffee spread, and the business flourished. They incorporated as the Horn & Hardart Baking Company in 1898.

It also explains that one out of every sixteen people in the city eats in the restaurant daily. In 1924, Horn & Hardart opened retail stores to sell prepackaged automat favorites. Using the advertising slogan, \\"Less Work for Mother,\\" the company popularized the notion of easily served \\"take-out\\" food as an equivalent to \\"home-cooked\\" meals.Hardart, Marianne and Lorraine B. Daily The Automat: The History, Recipes, and Allure of Horn & Hardart's Masterpiece. Clarkson Potter, 2002. The Horn & Hardart Automats were particularly popular during the Depression era, when their macaroni and cheese, baked beans, and creamed spinach were staple offerings. In the 1930s, union conflicts resulted in vandalism, as noted by Christopher Gray in The New York Times: > In 1932 the police blamed members of the glaziers union for vandalism > against 24 Horn & Hardart and Bickford's restaurants in Manhattan, including > the one at 488 Eighth Avenue. Witnesses said that a passenger in a car > driving by used a slingshot to damage and even break the plate glass show > windows.

Horn & Hardart automat in Times Square, circa 1939 By the time of Horn's death in 1941, the business had 157 retail shops and restaurants in the Philadelphia and New York areas, and served 500,000 patrons a day.\\"Joseph V. Horn, Automat Chain Co-Founder Dies,\\" The Washington Post, October 15, 1941, p. 23. During the 1940s and the 1950s, more than 50 New York Horn & Hardart restaurants served 350,000 customers a day. In 1953, the company split into two independent corporations: the New York company was named the Horn & Hardart Company, while the Philadelphia company was named the Horn & Hardart Baking Company. New York was traded on the American Stock Exchange, and Philadelphia was traded on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. =Coins and chrome= H&H; Automat brass token These cafeterias featured prepared foods behind small glass windows and coin-operated slots, beginning with buns, beans, fish cakes, and coffee. These were popular, busy restaurants, where in the late 1950s, for under $1.00, one could enjoy a large, if somewhat plain, meal purchased with nickels usually obtained from the cashier. Each stack of glass-doored dispensers had a metal cylinder that could be rotated by the staff on the other side of the vending wall, hiding the contents while they refilled each dispenser in the stack with a plate of salad, pudding, meat, or vegetables. Each dispenser had a slot for one or more nickels, and a knob to rotate the nickels out of view into the internal cash box and to allow the glass door to be raised up and locked in a horizontal position for easy removal of the plate or bowl of food. More expensive items required tokens valued up to 75¬¢ which were available from the cashier. Some of the rectangular dispensers were heated, some cooled. Eventually, they served lunch and dinner entrees, such as beef stew and Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes. The self-service restaurants operated in the city for nearly a century. Carolyn Hughes Crowley described the appeal of the Automats: =The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour= Radio program  Beginning in 1927, Horn & Hardart sponsored a radio program, The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour, a variety show with a cast of children (including some who as adults became well-known performers). The program was broadcast first on WCAU Radio in Philadelphia, hosted by Stan Lee Broza. It was broadcast on NBC Radio in New York during the 1940s and 1950s. The original New York host was Paul Douglas, succeeded by Ralph Edwards and finally Ed Herlihy. Television program The television premiere of The Horn & Hardart Children's Hour appeared on WCAU-TV in Philadelphia in 1948, succeeded by WNBT in New York in 1949, telecast on Sunday mornings. Stan Lee Broza hosted in Philadelphia, and Ed Herlihy in New York. Decline Sixth Avenue showing areas for beverages and pies at right of dining area The restaurant chain remained popular into the 1960s, featuring not only automats but sit-down waitress service restaurants, cafeterias, and bakery shops. In the late 1960s, consultants attempted to develop automats with interior decoration relevant to surrounding neighborhoods; thus, the Automat on 14th Street was decorated with psychedelic posters. The eateries began to close with the rise of fast-food restaurants, served over the counter and with more payment flexibility than traditional automats. By the mid-1970s, at some locations, Burger King franchises replaced the automats.\\"Closing the Automat Door,\\" by Peter Mikelbank, The Washington Post, September 7, 1975, p. 135. Horn & Hardart further expanded its fast food operations in 1981, with its acquisition of the Bojangles' Famous Chicken n' Biscuits restaurants, which it sold to a California investment company in 1990 for $20 million.Acquisitions, The Washington Post, August 30, 1990, pg. C2. In 1979, Horn & Hardart agreed to buy the Royal Inn in Las Vegas for $7.4 million. By late 1980, the sale had been completed, and the property was rebranded as the Royal Americana Hotel, with a New York theme. A $3.5 million renovation increased the room count to 300. By 1982 though, the hotel was experiencing substantial losses, and Horn & Hardart decided to close it. They reportedly agreed that December to sell the property to an investment group for $15.4 million. The last New York Horn & Hardart Automat (on the southeast corner of 42nd Street and Third Avenue) closed in April 1991.\\"Slices of History: At New York's Last Automat only the Ambiance is the Same,\\" by David Streitfeld, The Washington Post, April 24, 1988, p. 66. Horn & Hardart continued to own a catalog division; it renamed itself Hanover Direct in 1993. That year the company bought Gump's; it sold it to an investment group in 2005. Hanover Direct purchased International Male in 1987 when founder Gene Burkard retired. Revivals 818 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, site of first U.S. Automat, with original Horn & Hardart sign in July 2020 In 1987, Horn & Hardart opened two 1950s themed Dine-O-Mat restaurants in New York. They closed in 1989, after less than two years in operation. In the early 1990s, two entrepreneurs bought the Philadelphia company (Horn & Hardart Baking Co.) out of bankruptcy. While they did not open any restaurants, they did reproduce a dozen of the most famous food items, including macaroni and cheese, Harvard beets, tapioca pudding, and cucumber salad. The food was packed fresh, refrigerated, and sold in supermarkets throughout Philadelphia and New Jersey. The food was still available up until 2002, then disappeared from the stores. More recently, the Horn & Hardart name was used for a now-dormant chain of coffee shops in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Horn & Hardart Coffee Co. closed its last coffee shop in 2005. A company called Horn & Hardart Brands has a website, with a 2014 copyright, offering coffee online and at food stores in the Philadelphia area A version of the current automats used in the Netherlands, Bamn!!, was located in New York's East Village at 37 St. Mark's Place, between Second Avenue and Third Avenue, but has since closed, though their website is still active. Currently the Horn & Hardart ‚Äì Bakery Cafe is the name of a coffee shop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The assets of the company were purchased in 2015 and the brand is being reborn as Horn & Hardart Coffee. They have recreated the original East Coast City Roast and branded coffee is offered on their website. They also offer a subscription service called The Automat Club.

The scientific name is from Ancient Greek. The genus Syrrhaptes is from surrhaptos, \\"sewn together\\" (the feathered toes of both species in the genus are fused together) and paradoxus is from paradoxos, \\"strange\\". Description left Pallas's sandgrouse is long with small, pigeon-like head and neck, but sturdy compact body. It has long pointed wings and tail and legs and toes are feathered. Its plumage is buff coloured, barred above with a black belly patch and pale underwings. The black belly and pale underwing distinguish this species from the related Tibetan sandgrouse. The male Pallas's sandgrouse is distinguished by its grey head and breast, orange face and grey breast band. The female has duller plumage and lacks the breast band though it has more barring on the upperparts. The small feet lack a hind toe, and the three front toes are fused together. The upper surface is feathered, and the underneath has a fleshy pad. The appearance of the foot is more like a paw than an avian foot. Behaviour left This species breeds across middle latitudes of central Asia on dry steppes and similar habitats. Its nest is a ground scrape into which 2‚Äì3 greenish eggs with cryptic markings are laid. It is a partial migrant, especially from the northern parts of its range in Kazakhstan and Mongolia, but the extent and distance of the southerly winter movement depends on the amount of snowfall. Pallas's sandgrouse occasionally irrupts from its regular breeding and wintering range across Europe as far west as Great Britain, where it has bred, and Ireland. The reasons for these remarkable movements are not fully understood, but they have become less frequent, probably due to contraction of the western Siberian range as the steppes become more agricultural. Due to their primarily dry diet of seeds, the sandgrouse needs to drink a large volume of water. The sandgrouse's wing morphology allows for fast flight with speeds up to having been recorded. Large flocks of several thousand individuals fly to watering holes at dawn and dusk making round trips of up to per day. Male parents soak their breast plumage in water while drinking, allowing their chicks to drink from the absorbed moisture on their return.

In the Russian Orthodox Church a white klobuk is distinctive of a metropolitan (). Cardinal Daniel DiNardo is the Metropolitan Archbishop of Galveston-Houston. In the Roman Catholic Church, the pallium is unique to a metropolitan bishop. In Christian churches with episcopal polity, the rank of metropolitan bishop, or simply metropolitan (alternative obsolete form: metropolite ), pertains to the diocesan bishop or archbishop of a metropolis. Originally, the term referred to the bishop of the chief city of a historical Roman province, whose authority in relation to the other bishops of the province was recognized by the First Council of Nicaea (AD 325).First Council of Nicaea, canon IV The bishop of the provincial capital, the metropolitan, enjoyed certain rights over other bishops in the province, later called \\"suffragan bishops\\". The term \\"metropolitan\\" may refer in a similar sense to the bishop of the chief episcopal see (the \\"metropolitan see\\") of an ecclesiastical province. The head of such a metropolitan see has the rank of archbishop and is therefore called the metropolitan archbishop of the ecclesiastical province. Metropolitan (arch)bishops preside over synods of the bishops of their ecclesiastical province, and canon law and tradition grant them special privileges. In some churches, such as the Church of Greece, a metropolis is a rank granted to all episcopal sees. Their bishops are all called metropolitans, the title of archbishop being reserved for the primate.  Catholic Church  Coat of arms of a Catholic Metropolitan Archbishop = Latin Church = In the Latin Church, an ecclesiastical province, composed of several neighbouring dioceses,Code of Canon Law, canon 431 is headed by a metropolitan, the archbishop of the diocese designated by the Pope.Code of Canon Law, canon 435 The other bishops are known as suffragan bishops. The metropolitan's powers over dioceses other than his own are normally limited to: # supervising observance of faith and ecclesiastical discipline and notifying the Supreme Pontiff of any abuses; # carrying out, for reasons approved beforehand by the Holy See, a canonical inspection that the suffragan bishop has neglected to perform; # appointing a diocesan administrator if the college of consultors fails to elect an at least 35-year-old priest within eight days after the vacancy of the see becomes known;Code of Canon Law, canon 436 ¬ß1‚Äì2 and # serving as the default ecclesiastical court for appeals from decisions of the tribunals of the suffragan bishops.Canon 1438 no. 1. The metropolitan also has the liturgical privilege of celebrating sacred functions throughout the province, as if he were a bishop in his own diocese, provided only that, if he celebrates in a cathedral church, the diocesan bishop has been informed beforehand.Code of Canon Law, canon 436 ¬ß3 The metropolitan is obliged to request the pallium, a symbol of the power that, in communion with the Church of Rome, he possesses over his ecclesiastical province.Code of Canon Law, canon 437 This holds even if he had the pallium in another metropolitan see. It is the responsibility of the metropolitan, with the consent of the majority of the suffragan bishops, to call a provincial council, decide where to convene it, and determine the agenda. It is his prerogative to preside over the provincial council.Code of Canon Law, canon 442 No provincial council can be called if the metropolitan see is vacant.Code of Canon Law, canon 440 ¬ß2 All Latin Rite metropolitans are archbishops; however, some archbishops are not metropolitans, as there are a few instances where an archdiocese has no suffragans or is itself suffragan to another archdiocese. Titular archbishops (i.e. ordained bishops who are given an honorary title to a now-defunct archdiocese; e.g. many Vatican officials and papal nuncios and apostolic delegates are titular archbishops) are never metropolitans. As of April 2006, 508 archdioceses were headed by metropolitan archbishops, 27 archbishops lead an extant archdiocese, but were not metropolitans, and there were 89 titular archbishops. See also Catholic Church hierarchy for the distinctions. = Eastern Catholic = Lubomyr Husar, Major Archbishop emeritus of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church Within Patriarchal or Major Archiepiscopal Churches In those Eastern Catholic Churches that are headed by a patriarch, metropolitans in charge of ecclesiastical provinces hold a position similar to that of metropolitans in the Latin Church. Among the differences is that Eastern Catholic metropolitans within the territory of the patriarchate are to be ordained and enthroned by the patriarch, who may also ordain and enthrone metropolitans of sees outside that territory that are part of his Church.Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 86 Similarly, a metropolitan has the right to ordain and enthrone the bishops of his province.Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 133 The metropolitan is to be commemorated in the liturgies celebrated within his province.Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 135 A major archbishop is defined as the metropolitan of a certain see who heads an autonomous Eastern Church not of patriarchal rank. The canon law of such a Church differs only slightly from that regarding a patriarchal Church.Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 151‚Äì154 Within major archiepiscopal churches, there may be ecclesiastical provinces headed by metropolitan bishops. As heads of their own Particular Churches There are also autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches consisting of a single province and headed by a metropolitan. Metropolitans of this kind are to obtain the pallium from the Pope as a sign of his metropolitan authority and of his Church's full communion with the Pope, and only after his investment with it can he convoke the Council of Hierarchs and ordain the bishops of his autonomous Church.Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 156 In his autonomous Church it is for him to ordain and enthrone bishopsCode of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 159 and his name is to be mentioned immediately after that of the Pope in the liturgy.Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 161 Eastern Orthodox Metropolitan Vladimir of Saint Petersburg wearing the light blue mandyas of a Russian Orthodox metropolitan. In the Eastern Orthodox Churches, the title of metropolitan is used variously, in terms of rank and jurisdiction. In terms of rank, in some Eastern Orthodox Churches metropolitans are ranked above archbishops in precedence, while in others that order is reversed. Primates of autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches below patriarchal rank are generally designated as archbishops. In the Greek Orthodox Churches, archbishops are ranked above metropolitans in precedence. The reverse is true for some Slavic Orthodox Churches (Russian Orthodox, Bulgarian Orthodox) and also for Romanian Orthodox Church, where metropolitans rank above archbishops and the title can be used for important regional or historical sees. In terms of jurisdiction, there are two basic types of metropolitans in Eastern Orthodox Church: real metropolitans, with actual jurisdiction over their ecclesiastical provinces, and honorary metropolitans who are in fact just diocesan bishops with honorary title of metropolitan and no jurisdiction outside their own diocese. Some Eastern Orthodox Churches have functioning metropolitans on the middle (regional) level of church administration. In Romanian Orthodox Church there are six regional metropolitans who are the chairmen of their respective synods of bishops, and have special duties and privileges. For example, Metropolitan of Oltenia has regional jurisdiction over four dioceses. On the other hand, in some Eastern Orthodox Churches title of metropolitan is only honorary, with no special or additional jurisdiction. In Serbian Orthodox Church, honorary title of metropolitan is given to diocesan bishops of some important historical sees (Article 14 of the Constitution of Serbian Orthodox Church). For example, diocesan bishop of the Eparchy of Montenegro and the Littoral is given the honorary title of metropolitan, but without any jurisdiction over other diocesan bishops in Montenegro. Diocesan bishop of the Eparchy of Dabar-Bosnia is also given the honorary title of metropolitan, but without any jurisdiction over other diocesan bishops in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Non-canonical Eastern Orthodox Churches generally use metropolitan title according to local traditions of usage in Churches from which they were split (see: Macedonian Orthodox Church).  Oriental Orthodox Communion  =Malankara Churches= Metropolitan is a title used by all oriental orthodox churches in Malankara. Malankara Metropolitan was a legal title given to the head of the Malankara Syrian Church, aka Puthencoor (New Traditionalists) Syrian Christians, by the Government of Travancore and Cochin in South India. This title was awarded by a proclamation from the King of Travancore and the King of Cochin to the legal head of the Malankara Syrian Church. The Supreme Court of India had authenticated the usage of this title by the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church in its verdict in the Malankara Church case. Baselios Mar Thoma Paulose II was enthroned as Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan on 1 November 2010 at Parumala, Kerala. Under his see, the dioceses are further headed by Diocesan Metropolitans.  Other Oriental  In the Mar Thoma Syrian Churchhttp://mtcsv.org/history-of-marthoma-church/ which is based in India, the Metropolitan also known as the Mar Thoma is the primate and supreme head of the church who is entitled to special privileges and remains the ultimate authority over the synod. His Grace the Most Rev Dr. Philipose Mar Chrysostom is the senior metropolitan as of 28 August 2007, and His Grace the Most Rev Dr. Joseph Mar Thoma is the 21st Malankara Metropolitan and current primate, installed on 2 October 2007. The title is used by the Indian reformed Syrian Christian-like Evangelical denomination the Believers Eastern Church as the current main leader of the church Anglican In the Anglican Communion, a metropolitan is generally the head of an ecclesiastical province (or cluster of dioceses). In the few Anglican churches with multiple provinces headed by metropolitans (namely the Church of England, the Church of Ireland, the Anglican Church of Canada, the Anglican Church of Australia, and the Church of Nigeria), a metropolitan ranks immediately under the primate or senior metropolitan of the national church.http://www.anglican.ca/help/faq/ac- provinces/ Most metropolitans, but not all, are styled archbishop. In England, Ireland, and Australia, each province has a \\"metropolitical see\\" whose diocesan bishop is ex officio metropolitan (such as the Archbishops of Canterbury and Sydney), while in Canada metropolitans are elected by the provincial houses of bishops from among the sitting diocesans. Prior to 1970, however, the metropolitan of the Province of Rupert's Land was always the bishop of the eponymous diocese, centred on Winnipeg. (Since then, only one Bishop of Rupert's Land, Walter Jones, has been elected metropolitan).

Lauterbur was a professor at Stony Brook University from 1963 until 1985, where he conducted his research for the development of the MRI. In 1985 he became a professor along with his wife Joan at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for 22 years until his death in Urbana. He never stopped working with undergraduates on research, and he served as a professor of chemistry, with appointments in bioengineering, biophysics, the College of Medicine at Urbana-Champaign and computational biology at the Center for Advanced Study. Early life Lauterbur was of Luxembourgish ancestry. Born and raised in Sidney, Ohio, Lauterbur graduated from Sidney High School, where a new Chemistry, Physics, and Biology wing was dedicated in his honor. As a teenager, he built his own laboratory in the basement of his parents' house. His chemistry teacher at school understood that he enjoyed experimenting on his own, so the teacher allowed him to do his own experiments at the back of class. When he was drafted into the United States Army in the 1950s, his superiors allowed him to spend his time working on an early nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) machine; he had published four scientific papers by the time he left the Army. Paul became an atheist later on.Dawson, M. Joan. Paul Lauterbur and the Invention of MRI. Cambridge, MA: MIT, 2013. Print. \\"Paul became an atheist, revering intellectual honesty and the quest for truth.\\" Education and career Lauterbur received a BS in chemistry from the Case Institute of Technology, now part of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio where he became a Brother of the Alpha Delta chapter of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. He then went to work at the Mellon Institute laboratories of the Dow Corning Corporation, with a 2-year break to serve at the Army Chemical Center in Edgewood, Maryland. While working at Mellon Institute he pursued graduate studies in chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. Earning his PhD in 1962, the following year Lauterbur accepted a position as associate professor at Stony Brook University. As a visiting faculty in chemistry at Stanford University during the 1969‚Äì1970 academic year, he undertook NMR-related research with the help of local businesses Syntex and Varian Associates. Lauterbur returned to Stony Brook, continuing there until 1985 when he moved to the University of Illinois. The development of the MRI Lauterbur credits the idea of the MRI to a brainstorm one day at a suburban Pittsburgh Eat'n Park Big Boy Restaurant, with the MRI's first model scribbled on a table napkin while he was a student and researcher at both the University of Pittsburgh and the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research. The further research that led to the Nobel Prize was performed at Stony Brook UniversityNobel Prize Awardee Paul Lauterbur Returns To SBU Where His Winning Research Was Conducted In The '70s in the 1970s. The Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952, which went to Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell, was for the development of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the scientific principle behind MRI. However, for decades magnetic resonance was used mainly for studying the chemical structure of substances. It wasn't until the 1970s with Lauterbur's and Mansfield's developments that NMR could be used to produce images of the body. Lauterbur used the idea of Robert Gabillard (developed in his doctoral thesis, 1952) of introducing gradients in the magnetic field which allows for determining the origin of the radio waves emitted from the nuclei of the object of study. This spatial information allows two-dimensional pictures to be produced. While Lauterbur conducted his work at Stony Brook, the best NMR machine on campus belonged to the chemistry department; he had to visit it at night to use it for experimentation and would carefully change the settings so that they would return to those of the chemists' as he left. The original MRI machine is located at the Chemistry building on the campus of Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York. Some of the first images taken by Lauterbur included those of a 4-mm-diameter clam his daughter had collected on the beach at the Long Island Sound, green peppers and two test tubes of heavy water within a beaker of ordinary water; no other imaging technique in existence at that time could distinguish between two different kinds of water. This last achievement is particularly important as the human body consists mostly of water. When Lauterbur first submitted his paper with his discoveries to Nature, the paper was rejected by the editors of the journal. Lauterbur persisted and requested them to review it again, upon which time it was published and is now acknowledged as a classic Nature paper. The Nature editors pointed out that the pictures accompanying the paper were too fuzzy, although they were the first images to show the difference between heavy water and ordinary water. Lauterbur said of the initial rejection: \\"You could write the entire history of science in the last 50 years in terms of papers rejected by Science or Nature.\\" Peter Mansfield of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom took Lauterbur's initial work another step further, replacing the slow (and prone to artefacts) projection-reconstruction method used by Lautebur's original technique with a method that used frequency and phase encoding by spatial gradients of magnetic field. Owing to Larmor precession, a mathematical technique called a Fourier transformation could then be used to recover the desired image, greatly speeding up the imaging process. Lauterbur unsuccessfully attempted to file patents related to his work to commercialize the discovery. The State University of New York chose not to pursue patents, with the rationale that the expense would not pay off in the end. \\"The company that was in charge of such applications decided that it would not repay the expense of getting a patent. That turned out not to be a spectacularly good decision,\\" Lauterbur said in 2003. He attempted to get the federal government to pay for an early prototype of the MRI machine for years in the 1970s, and the process took a decade. The University of Nottingham did file patents which later made Mansfield wealthy. U.S. President George W. Bush with the six 2003 American Nobel laureates in the Oval Office.

Nobel Prize Lauterbur was awarded the Nobel Prize along with Mansfield in the fall of 2003. Controversy occurred when Raymond Damadian took out full-page ads in The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times headlined \\"The Shameful Wrong That Must Be Righted\\" saying that the Nobel committee had not included him as a Prize winner alongside Lauterbur and Mansfield for his early work on the MRI. Damadian claimed that he discovered MRI and the two Nobel-winning scientists refined his technology. The New York Times published an editorial saying that while scientists credit Damadian for holding an early patent in MRI technology, Lauterbur and Mansfield expanded upon Herman Carr's technique in order to produce first 2D and then 3D MR images. The editorial deems this to be worthy of a Nobel prize even though it states clearly in Alfred Nobel's will that prizes are not to be given out solely on the basis of improving an existing technology for commercial use. The newspaper then points out a few cases in which precursor discoveries had been awarded with a Nobel, along with a few deserving cases in which it had not, such as Rosalind Franklin, Oswald Avery, . Death Lauterbur died aged 77 in March 2007 of kidney disease at his home in Urbana, Illinois.

Mansfield is the youngest of three brothers. Mansfield grew up in Camberwell. During World War II he was evacuated from London, initially to Sevenoaks and then twice to Torquay, Devon, where he was able to stay with the same family on both occasions. On returning to London after the war he was told by a school master to take the 11+ exam. Having never heard of the exam before, and having no time to prepare, Mansfield failed to gain a place at the local Grammar school. His mark was, however, high enough for him to go to a Central School in Peckham. At the age of 15 he was told by a careers teacher that science wasn't for him. He left school shortly afterwards to work as a printer's assistant. At the age of 18, having developed an interest in rocketry, Mansfield took up a job with the Rocket Propulsion Department of the Ministry of Supply in Westcott, Buckinghamshire. Eighteen months later he was called up for National Service. Education After serving in the army for two years, Mansfield returned to Westcott and started studying for A-levels at night school. Two years later he was admitted to study physics at Queen Mary College, University of London. Mansfield graduated with a BSc from Queen Mary's in 1959. His final-year project, supervised by Jack Powles, was to construct a portable, transistor-based spectrometer to measure the Earth's magnetic field. Towards the end of this project Powles offered Mansfield a position in his NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) research group. Powles' interest was in studying molecular motion, mainly liquids. Mansfield's project was to build a pulsed NMR spectrometer to study solid polymer systems. He received his PhD in 1962; his thesis was titled Proton magnetic resonance relaxation in solids by transient methods. Career Following his PhD, Mansfield was invited to postdoctoral research with Charlie Slichter at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, where he carried out an NMR study of doped metals. In 1964 he returned to England to take up a place as a Lecturer at Nottingham University where he could continue his studies in multiple-pulse NMR. He was successively appointed Senior Lecturer in 1968 and Reader in 1970. During this period his team developed the MRI equipment with the help of grants from the Medical Research Council. It was not until the 1970s with Paul Lauterbur's and Mansfield's developments that NMR could be used to produce images of the body. In 1979 Mansfield was appointed Professor of the Department of Physics until his retirement in 1994. * 1962: Research Associate, Department of Physics, University of Illinois * 1964: Lecturer, Department of Physics, University of Nottingham * 1968: Senior Lecturer, Department of Physics, University of Nottingham * 1970: Reader, Department of Physics, University of Nottingham * 1972-3: Senior Visitor, Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, Heidelberg * 1979: Professor, Department of Physics, University of Nottingham Mansfield is credited with inventing 'slice selection' for MRI and understanding how the radio signals from MRI can be mathematically analysed, making interpretation of the signals into a useful image a possibility. He is also credited with discovering how fast imaging could be possible by developing the MRI protocol called echo-planar imaging. Echo-planar imaging allows T2* weighted images to be collected many times faster than previously possible. It also has made functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) feasible.

While individuals with a sexual preference for adults may have some sexual interest in pubescent-aged individuals, researchers and clinical diagnoses have proposed that hebephilia is characterized by a sexual preference for pubescent rather than adult partners. Hebephilia is approximate in its age range because the onset and completion of puberty vary. On average, girls begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11 while boys begin at age 11 or 12. Partly because puberty varies, some definitions of chronophilias (sexual preference for a specific physiological appearance related to age) show overlap between pedophilia, hebephilia and ephebophilia. For example, the DSM-5 extends the prepubescent age to 13, the ICD-10 includes early pubertal age in its definition of pedophilia,See section F65.4 Paedophilia. and some definitions of ephebophilia include age 14. Proposals for categorizing hebephilia have argued that separating sexual attraction to prepubescent children from sexual attraction to early-to-mid or late pubescents is clinically relevant. According to research by Ray Blanchard et al. (2009), male sex offenders could be separated into groups by victim age preference on the basis of penile plethysmograph response patterns. Based on their results, Blanchard suggested that the DSM-5 could account for these data by subdividing the existing diagnosis of pedophilia into hebephilia and a narrower definition of pedophilia. Blanchard's proposal to add hebephilia to the DSM-5 proved controversial, and was not adopted. It has not been widely accepted as a paraphilia or mental disorder, and there is significant academic debate as to whether it should be classified as either. Etymology, definitions and history The term hebephilia is based on the Greek goddess and protector of youth Hebe, but, in Ancient Greece, also referred to the time before manhood in Athens (depending on the reference, the specific age could be 14, 16 or 18 years old). The suffix -philia is derived from -phil-, implying love or strong friendship. Hebephilia is defined as a chronophilia in which an adult has a strong and persistent sexual interest in pubescent children, typically children aged 11‚Äì14, although the age of onset and completion of puberty vary. Although sexologist Ray Blanchard and others who proposed the hebephilia diagnosis have focused on pubescents in Tanner stages 2 and 3 (centering on children who have begun to show signs of pubertal development of sex characteristics but are not at or near the end of this process), discussion of hebephilia has also concerned attraction to pubescents and adolescents in general, which has contributed to confusion among those who have debated the topic. The DSM-5's diagnostic criteria for pedophilia and the general medical literature define pedophilia as a disorder of primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children, thus excluding hebephilia from its definition of pedophilia. However, the DSM-5's age criteria extends to age 13. Although the ICD-10 diagnostic code for the definition of pedophilia includes a sexual preference for children of prepubertal or early pubertal age, the ICD-11 states that \\"pedophilic disorder is characterized by a sustained, focused, and intense pattern of sexual arousal‚Äîas manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours‚Äîinvolving pre-pubertal children.\\" Because of some inconsistencies in definitions and differences in the physical development of children and adolescents, there is overlap between pedophilia, hebephilia and ephebophilia. The term hebephilia was first used in 1955, in forensic work by Hammer and Glueck. Anthropologist and ethno- psychiatrist Paul K. Benedict used the term to distinguish pedophiles from sex offenders whose victims were adolescents. Karen Franklin, a California forensic psychologist, interpreted hebephilia to be a variation of ephebophilia, used by Magnus Hirschfeld in 1906 to describe homosexual attraction to males between puberty and their early twenties, who considered the condition normal and nonpathological. She said that, historically, adults being sexual with pubescents was considered distinct from other forms of criminal sexuality (such as rape), with wide variations within and across nations regarding what age was acceptable for adult-adolescent sexual contacts. Bernard Glueck Jr. conducted research on sex offenders at Sing Sing prison in the 1950s, using hebephilia as one of several classifications of subjects according to offense. In the 1960s, sexologist Kurt Freund used the term to distinguish between age preferences of heterosexual and homosexual men during penile plethysmograph assessments, continuing his work with Ray Blanchard at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) after emigrating to Canada in 1968. After Freund's death in 1996, researchers at CAMH conducted research on neurological explanations of pedophilia, transsexuality, and homosexuality, and based on this research, hypothesized that hebephiles could also be distinguished on the basis of neurological and physiological measures. Research =General= Multiple research studies have investigated the sexual attraction patterns of hebephilic and pedophilic men. The sexual attraction to children appears to fall along a continuum instead of being dichotomous. The attractions of hebephiles and pedophiles are less focused on the child's sex than are the attractions of teleiophiles (people who sexually prefer adults)‚Äîi.e., much larger proportions of hebephiles and pedophiles than teleiophiles report being attracted to both males and females. Hebephilia, together with pedophilia and some other paraphilias, has been found to be an important motivator of sexual offending. It also has a high degree of overlap with pedophilia, as well as with similar correlates of sexual offending. The Prevention Project Dunkelfeld is an effort founded in Germany to provide therapy and abuse prevention techniques to adults attracted to children. In a study of 222 men contacting the Dunkelfeld project for help, roughly two-thirds had a sexual interest in pubertal children. These men also reported experiencing high levels of psychological distress, at clinically relevant levels. Both the hebephiles and the pedophiles showed greater distress than teleiophiles, but they did not differ from each other. =Correlates= Researchers from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto conducted a series of studies on neurological and psychological correlates of hebephilia, including brain structure, handedness, intelligence quotient, lesser educational attainment or greater probability of repeating a year in primary education, height, and other markers of atypical physical development. These findings suggest that problems during prenatal development play a significant role in the development of hebephilia. In some cases, head trauma during pre-pubertal childhood, or experiencing sexual abuse during puberty, could also be contributing factors. Differences in brain structure may mean that hebephilic interests result from disconnections in the brain networks that recognize and react to sexual cues. =Prevalence= The prevalence of hebephilia within the general population is unknown. There is evidence suggesting that within clinical and correctional samples, as well as anonymous surveys of people sexually interested in children, there are more individuals with an erotic interest in pubescent rather than in prepubescent children. DSM-5 debate =Proposal= The DSM-5's diagnostic criteria for pedophilia specifies it as a disorder of sexual interest in prepubescent children generally age 13 years or younger. A 2009 research paper by Ray Blanchard and colleagues indicated that, based on penile plethysmographs, sex offenders could be grouped according to the sexual maturity of individuals they found most attractive (because ages are not a specific indication of adolescent sexual development, Blanchard used stimuli with a Tanner scale rating of 1 on essentially all measures to evaluate hebephilic offenders while adult control stimuli all had a Tanner rating of 5). Blanchard noted that the most common age of victims for sexual offenders was 14 years, and suggested there were qualitative differences between offenders who preferred pubertal sex-objects and those with a prepubertal preference. The paper concluded that the DSM-5 could better account for those data if it split the DSM-IV-TR's existing criteria for pedophilia, which focuses on sexual attraction to prepubescent children, but sets the age range at generally 13 or younger. Blanchard suggested the criteria be split into pedophilia as sexual attraction to prepubescent children who are generally younger than 11, and hebephilia as sexual attraction to pubescent children, generally 11‚Äì14 years old. What the DSM-IV calls pedophilia would instead be termed pedohebephilia, with pedophilic and hebephilic sub-types. The proposed criteria for the DSM-5 involved an adult who, for six or more months, experienced sexual attraction to prepubescent or pubescent children that was equal to or greater than their attraction to adults, and who also either found the attraction distressing, used child pornography or had sought sexual stimulation from a child, on at least three occasions in the case of the hebephilic type. The proposed criteria would have been applied to subjects aged 18 or older and who are at least five years older than children to whom they are typically attracted. The sexual and gender identity working group justified inclusion of the use of child pornography due to the expectation that pedohebephilic individuals would deny their sexual preferences, leaving it up to the diagnosing clinician to make inferences whether their patients are more interested in children than adults. The altered wording (from \\"prepubescent\\" to \\"prepubescent and pubescent\\") and reference age (from a maximum age of 13 to 14) would change how pedophilia was diagnosed to include victims with Tanner scale ratings of 2 or 3 who had partially developed some secondary sexual characteristics. =Responses= General Researchers at the German Dunkelfeld project supported the explicit mention of hebephilia in DSM-5: \\"Concerning the update of the DSM (DSM-5) a category called 'hebephilic disorder' would have been appropriate, especially considering the given data which shows that in men with a hebephilic preference, who seek treatment, the disorder criteria of the DSM-5 (psychological distress, behavior endangering others) are given in many cases. In this respect there would be men with hebephilia as well as men with a 'hebephilic disorder.'\\" In a letter to the editor, Thomas Zander argued there would be serious consequences from expanding the definition of pedophilia to include hebephilia, and stated that there are problems in distinguishing between prepubescent versus pubescent victims and thus in classifying offenders, and concluded that it required more research and consideration of implications before the DSM was changed. Blanchard agreed that distinguishing between pedophiles and hebephiles may present difficulties, but stated that in the case of a repeat sexual offender, these fine distinctions would be less important; he noted that other objections raised by Zander's letter were addressed in the original article. In another letter to the editor, physician Charles Moser agreed with Blanchard et al.'s premise that there was a distinction between sex offenders who preferred pubescent versus prepubescent victims and supported the term's usefulness in conducting research, but questioned whether hebephilia would represent a true paraphilia. Karen Franklin stated that she believes the concept is largely the result of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, although CAMH scientist and pedophilia researcher James Cantor challenged her factual accuracy, citing the existence of the concept in the ICD-10,Cantor in his 2012 rebuttal in the International Journal of Forensic Mental Health states \\"The current version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) contains code F65.4, which defines paedophilia as 'A sexual preference for children, boys or girls or both, usually of prepubertal or early pubertal age' (World Health Organization, 2007; emphasis added). That is, people with a sexual preference for early pubescent children do indeed receive a diagnosis in the ICD system. In Franklin's defense, one could claim that the word 'hebephilia' does not appear in the ICD; however, the people with hebephilia would receive a diagnosis nonetheless.\\" the use of the word in 100 scholarly texts from a variety of disciplines and time periods, and the existence of 32 peer reviewed papers researching the concept. Psychologist Skye Stephens and sexologist Michael C. Seto also argue that because the ICD-10 includes \\"prepubertal or early pubertal age\\" in its classification of pedophilia, it includes both pedophilic and hebephilic sexual interests. At a 2009 meeting of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, concern was raised that the criteria could have produced both false positives and false negatives, and that hebephilia as a DSM diagnosis could pathologize sex offenders who have opportunistically preyed on pubescent victims but do not have a paraphilic attachment to a specific age of victim, while excluding offenders who had committed serious offences on only one or two victims. During academic conferences for the American Academy of Psychiatry and Law and International Association for the Treatment of Sexual Offenders, symbolic votes were taken regarding whether the DSM-5 should include pedohebephilia, and in both cases an overwhelming majority voted against this. In a letter to the editor, clinical psychologist Joseph Plaud criticized the study for lacking control groups for post- pubescent and normal patterns of male sexual arousal, overlap between groups Blanchard believed were separate, and lack of specificity in the data. Blanchard replied that the initial publication used sex offenders who had committed crimes against post-pubescent adults as a control group, and that the results supported victim age preferences being a continuous rather than categorical variable. In separate letters to the editor, forensic psychologist Gregory DeClue and mathematician Philip Tromovitch agreed the term would be valuable for research purposes and to subdivide the current diagnosis of pedophilia into victim age preferences, but expressed concern over the term's potential to dramatically expand the number of people diagnosed with a paraphilia without an adequate research base to support it, and that the article did not include a definition of \\"mental disorder\\" and thus lacked the ability to distinguish the pathological from the non-pathological. Blanchard stated in a reply that his paper was written under the assumptions that the DSM-5's definition of mental disorder and pathologizing of sexual activity with underaged individuals would be similar to the one found in the DSM-IV. Child sexual abuse researcher William O'Donohue believes, based on the incentive for offenders to lie, that there is a risk of false negatives. O'Donohue praised Blanchard et al.'s proposal to distinguish hebephilia from pedophilia, but questioned the inclusion of offender distress, the use of child pornography as a determining factor and requiring a minimum of three victims, believing the latter choice would result in delayed treatment for hebephiles who have not acted on their urges while ignoring the often hidden nature of child sexual abuse. O'Donohue also had concerns over how information for making decisions about the proposed diagnosis would be acquired, whether the diagnosis could be made with reliability and sufficient agreement between clinicians and issues related to treatment. Attraction as normal or abnormal  Debate about hebephilia has also concerned whether the attraction is normal or abnormal. Karen Franklin has criticized use of the term hebephilia for pathologizing and criminalizing an adaptation, arguing that the concept stigmatizes a \\"widespread and, indeed, evolutionarily adaptive\\" sexual attraction of homosexual and heterosexual males who, across cultures and throughout history \\"tend to prefer youthful partners who are at the peak of both beauty and reproductive fertility\\". Commenting on Blanchard et al.'s proposal, psychologists Robert Prentky and Howard Barbaree stated that examples of highly sexualized young girls appear frequently in advertising, fashion shows, television programs, and films, making it questionable whether sexual attraction to pubescents is abnormal. Psychiatrist Allen Frances argued that attraction to pubescent individuals is within the normal range of human behavior and thus could not be considered sexually deviant, though acting on such attraction could be considered a crime.Frances, Allen \\"DSM 5 Needs to Reject Hebephilia Now\\" Psychology Today, 15.06.2011, retrieved 27.07.18 Thomas Zander also expressed concern about the degree to which the potential diagnosis genuinely reflected normal versus abnormal sexual desire. Blanchard argued that critics of his proposal were performing a \\"rhetorical sleight-of-hand\\" that conflated sexual attraction with sexual preference, arguing that while normal men may show some degree of attraction to pubescents, they overwhelmingly prefer physically mature adults. In contrast, hebephiles have an equal or greater sexual preference for pubescents compared to physically mature adults.Blanchard, Ray. \\"A dissenting opinion on DSM-5 pedophilic disorder.\\" Archives of Sexual Behavior 42, no. 5 (2013): 675-678. He responded to Franklin's comment, writing that presumably Franklin's \\"adaptationist argument\\" applied only to heterosexual males, as homosexual hebephilia would have no reproductive advantages. Blanchard cited recent research he had conducted regarding the alleged reproductive success of hebephiles, pedophiles and individuals attracted primarily or exclusively to adults. The results indicated that teleiophiles had more children, and thus more adaptive success than hebephiles, while hebephiles had more success than pedophiles. From this, Blanchard concluded that \\"there is no empirical basis for the hypothesis that hebephilia was associated with increased reproductive success in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. That speculative adaptationist argument against the inclusion of hebephilia in the DSM cannot be sustained\\". Some authors have argued that dysfunction is culturally relative or a social construct, such as by pointing to historical societies where marriage between pubescent girls and older men was practiced. Anthropologist David Ryniker wrote that cultures that practiced marriage between adult men and pubescent girls did so for economic and social reasons, not due to any sexual preference. He argued that, based on the biological evidence, humans did not evolve a strategy of early fertility, and that a sexual focus on pubescents would be maladaptive. Anthropologist Raymond Hames and Blanchard argued that in most cultures, pubescent girls did not begin sexual activity until they were at or near the end of puberty. Stephens and Seto argue that hebephilia can be considered dysfunctional, stating that \\"conceptually, hebephilia is a paraphilia, reflecting an atypical (statistically rare) sexual age interest in pubescent children.\\" They state that hebephilia is a malfunction of the biological mechanism which drives males to be attracted to sexually mature females, and that while typical men are attracted to youthfulness, they are also interested in cues of sexual maturity (adult size, fully developed breasts, and a waist-to-hip ratio of around 0.70). Hebephiles, by contrast, respond positively to cues of youthfulness but negatively to cues of sexual maturity. Penile plethysmography results show that heterosexual men are preferentially attracted to adult women, with lower responses to pubescent girls and then prepubescent girls, and then males of all ages causing the least response. Stephens and Seto also argue that hebephilia is dysfunctional because it causes significant distress or impairment in those who have it, perhaps via legal issues or disrupted adult relationships, because hebephilic behavior violates social norms or is even illegal in most contemporary cultures. =Use in court= Forensic psychologist Charles Patrick Ewing criticized the diagnosis, saying it is a transparent attempt to ensure that sex offenders who target pubescent teenagers may be subject to involuntary civil commitment. DSM-IV editors Michael First and Allen Frances expressed concern that hebephilia could be misused in civil commitment hearings, and questioned the need and evidence for the inclusion. Frances wrote that the diagnosis of hebephilia \\"has no place in forensic proceedings.\\" Charles Moser argued against what he saw as the problematic use of paraphilic labels to pathologize unusual sexual interests and incarcerate individuals on the basis of their paraphilia rather than their behavior. He also questioned the usefulness of paraphilias in general when the real issue may be criminal behaviors or stigmatization of unusual but benign sexual acts. Of hebephilia in civil commitment, Prentky and Barbaree wrote, \\"Hence, for self-serving reasons, it is applauded by those who generally work for the prosecution and criticized by those who generally work for the defense. This is an admittedly cynical, if unfortunately accurate, commentary on the influence of adversarial litigation on clinical deliberation.\\" Psychologist Douglas Tucker and lawyer Samuel Brakel stated that civil commitment as a sexually violent predator does not require a DSM diagnosis, so long as the clinicians who testify in courts do so in good faith and they identify a conceptually and empirically meaningful mental abnormality that is predictive of future sexual violence, irrespective of the term used. Some courts have accepted the hebephilia diagnosis while others have not. In court cases where the term hebephilia is used, it is placed within the DSM category of paraphilia, not otherwise specified (NOS). The diagnosis of hebephilia was rejected in one United States federal court in 2009 for being a label, not a \\"generally accepted mental disorder\\" and because a mere attraction to pubescent adolescents is not indicative of a mental disorder. Although the court rejected the government's claim that hebephilia is a mental disorder, the government argued that hebephilia may at times fall within a DSM-IV category of NOS. The court was also unconvinced by this.

The term can also refer to aspects of a non-graphical user interface (such as a command-line interface), as well as to aspects of an API ‚Äì mostly to parts of an API that are not related to its functional properties. The term is used in reference to both software and websites. Look and feel applies to other products. In documentation, for example, it refers to the graphical layout (document size, color, font, etc.) and the writing style. In the context of equipment, it refers to consistency in controls and displays across a product line. Look and feel in operating system user interfaces serves two general purposes. First, it provides branding, helping to identify a set of products from one company. Second, it increases ease of use, since users will become familiar with how one product functions (looks, reads, etc.) and can translate their experience to other products with the same look and feel. In widget toolkits Contrary to operating system user interfaces, for which look and feel is a part of the product identification, widget toolkits often allow users to specialize their application look and feel, by deriving the default look and feel of the toolkit, or by completely defining their own. This specialization can go from skinning (that only deals with the look, or visual appearance of the graphical control elements) to completely specializing the way the user interacts with the software (that is, the feel). The definition of the look and feel to associate with the application is often done at initialization, but some Widget toolkits, such as the Swing widget toolkit that is part of the Java API, allow users to change the look and feel at runtime (see Pluggable look and feel). Some examples of Widget toolkits that support setting a specialized look and feel are: * XUL (XML User Interface Language): The look and feel of the user interface can be specialized in a CSS file associated with the XUL definition files. Properties that can be specialized from the default are, for example, background or foreground colors of widgets, fonts, size of widgets, and so on. * Swing supports specializing the look and feel of widgets by deriving from the default, another existing one, creating one from scratch, or, beginning with J2SE 5.0, in an XML property file called synth (skinnable look and feel). Lawsuits Some companies try to assert copyright of trade dress over their look and feel. The Broderbund v. Unison (1986) case was an early software copyright case that attempted to apply U.S. copyright law to the look and feel presented by a software product. In 1987 Lotus sued Paperback Software and Mosaic for copyright infringement, false and misleading advertising, and unfair competition over their low-cost clones of 1-2-3, VP Planner and Twin, and sued Borland over its Quattro spreadsheet. In December 1989, Xerox sued Apple over the Macintosh copyright. Apple Computer was notable for its use of the term look and feel in reference to their Mac OS operating system. The firm tried, with some success, to block other software developers from creating software that had a similar look and feel. Apple argued that they had a copyright claim on the look and feel of their software, and even went so far as to sue Microsoft, alleging that the Windows operating system was illegally copying their look and feel. Although provoking a vehement reaction from some in the software community, and causing Richard Stallman to form the League for Programming Freedom, the expected landmark ruling never happened, as most of the issues were resolved based on a license that Apple had granted Microsoft for Windows 1.0. See: Apple v. Microsoft. The First Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a copyright claim on the feel of a user interface in Lotus v. Borland. =Taking it to the street= GNU's Richard M. Stallman led an \\"Innovate, don't litigate\\" public demonstration outside Lotus's headquarters, using a hexadecimal chant: :: 1-2-3-4 kick the lawsuits out the door :: 5-6-7-8 innovate, don't litigate :: 9-A-B-C interfaces should be free :: D,E,F,0(Oh) look and feel has got to go! =More recent reactions= In 2012 and 2014, Apple Inc. has filed lawsuits against competing manufacturers of smartphones and tablet computers, claiming that those manufacturers copied the look and feel of Apple's popular iPhone and iPad products. In APIs An API, which is an interface to software which provides some sort of functionality, can also have a certain look and feel.

It was discovered by Gottfried Kirch in 1702. Discovery and visibility M5 is, under extremely good conditions, just visible to the naked eye as a faint \\"star\\" near the star 5 Serpentis. Binoculars or small telescopes will identify the object as non-stellar while larger telescopes will show some individual stars, of which the brightest are of apparent magnitude 12.2. M5 was discovered by German astronomer Gottfried Kirch in 1702 when he was observing a comet. Charles Messier also noted it in 1764, but thought it was a nebula without any stars associated with it. William Herschel was the first to resolve individual stars in the cluster in 1791, counting roughly 200. Notable stars 105 stars in M5 are known to be variable in brightness, 97 of them belonging to the RR Lyrae type. RR Lyrae stars, sometimes referred to as \\"Cluster Variables\\", are somewhat similar to Cepheid type variables and as such can be used as a tool to measure distances in outer space since the relation between their luminosities and periods are well known. The brightest and most easily observed variable in M5 varies from magnitude 10.6 to 12.1 in a period of just under 26.5 days. A dwarf nova has also been observed in this cluster.

The film became a phenomenon and won three Oscars at the 49th Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The same ceremony was also the first time Conti served as musical director for the telecast, a role he reprised 18 times, more than any other person. His training montage tune, \\"Gonna Fly Now\\", topped the Billboard singles chart in 1977, and earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. Conti also composed music for the sequels Rocky II (1979), Rocky III (1982), Rocky V (1990) and Rocky Balboa (2006). Other film and television credits Conti also worked for some other films and, eventually, for television series. In 1981, he wrote the music for the James Bond film, For Your Eyes Only, when John Barry was unwilling to return to the United Kingdom for tax reasons, and provided the score for playwright Jason Miller's film version of his Pulitzer Prize winning play That Championship Season the following year.

He wrote the theme song to the original version of American Gladiators, worked with CBS on its 1980s movie jingle, composed one of the early themes of Inside Edition, and wrote the Primetime Live theme for ABC News. He composed the score to the studio altered American version of Luc Besson's The Big Blue. Two of Conti's previously-composed works were reused for the show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. These were the love theme \\"Come with Me Now\\" from the soundtrack for Five Days from Home (used for the show's main theme), and \\"Runaway\\", from For Your Eyes Only (used for in-show content).

The area was home to Native Americans, some of whom left caves containing rock art. Chatsworth was explored and colonized by the Spanish beginning in the 18th century. The land was part of a Spanish land grant, Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando, in the 19th century, and after the United States took over the land following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, it was the largest such grant in California. Settlement and development followed. Chatsworth has seven public and eight private schools. There are large open-space and smaller recreational parks as well as a public library and a transportation center. Distinctive features are the former Chatsworth Reservoir and the Santa Susana Field Laboratory. The neighborhood has one of the lowest population densities in Los Angeles and a relatively high income level. Chatsworth is the home of the Iverson Movie Ranch, a 500-acre area which was the most filmed movie ranch in history, as more than 2000 productions used it as a filming location. Population The 2000 U.S. census counted 35,073 residents in the 15.24-square-mile Chatsworth neighborhood, or 2,301 people per square mile, among the lowest population densities for both the city and the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 37,102. In 2000 the median age for residents was 40, considered old for city and county neighborhoods; the percentages of residents aged 35 and older were among the county's highest. The neighborhood was considered to be ethnically \\"moderately diverse\\" for both the city of Los Angeles and its county, with a relatively high percentage of whites and of Asian people, and a sizable Hispanic/Latino community. The breakdown was Whites, 65.7%; Asians, 14.4%; Latinos, 13.5%; Blacks, 2.2%; and others, 4.2%. Korea (10.4%) and the Philippines (9.3%) were the most common places of birth for the 25.2% of the residents who were born abroad‚Äîa low figure for Los Angeles. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $84,456, considered high for the city. The percentages of families that earned more than $40,000 was considered high for the county. Renters occupied 28.9% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment-owners held 71.1%. The average household size of 2.6 people was considered average for Los Angeles. In 2000 there were 2,933 military veterans, or 10.8% of the population, a high percentage compared to the rest of the city. The percentage of married people was among the county's highest. The rate of 10% of families headed by single parents was low for the city. Geography Chatsworth is flanked by the Santa Susana Mountains on the north, Porter Ranch and Northridge on the east, Winnetka, Canoga Park, West Hills on the south, the Simi Hills, and unincorporated Los Angeles County and Ventura County on the west, and Twin Lakes, a community founded by San Francisco's George Haight in the early 20th century and unincorporated Los Angeles County which includes a 1,600 acre park with equestrian trails, to the north. Climate This region experiences hot and dry summers, with average daily high temperatures of 90‚Äì100 ¬∞F. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Chatsworth has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \\"Csb\\" on climate maps. History =Native Americans= Chatsworth was inhabited by the Tongva-Fernande√±o, Chumash-Ventura√±o, and Tataviam-Fernande√±o Native American tribes. Native American civilizations inhabited the Valley for an estimated 8,000 years. Stoney Point is the site of the Tongva Native American settlement of Asha'awanga or Momonga, which was also a trading place with the neighboring Tataviam and Chumash people. The nearby Burro Flats Painted Cave remains a legacy of the Chumash culture's rock art and solstice ceremony spirituality. =Spain and Mexico= The first European explorers came into the Chatsworth area on August 5, 1769, led by the Spanish military leader Gaspar de Portol√†. With its establishment in 1797 and subsequent Spanish Land Grant by the King of Spain, Mission San Fernando (Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a) gained dominion over the San Fernando Valley's lands, including future Chatsworth. Old Santa Susana Stage Road trail up scenic Simi Hills in Chatsworth The Native American trail that had existed from the Tongva-Tatavium village called rancheria Santa Susana (Chatsworth) to another village, replaced by Mission San Fernando, became the route for missionaries and other Spanish travel up and down California. It was part of the El Camino del Santa Susana y Simi trail that connected the Valley's Mission, Los Angeles pueblo (town), and the southern missions with the Mission San Buenaventura, the Presidio of Monterey, and the northward missions. The trail crossed over the Santa Susana Pass to the Simi Valley, through present day city park Chatsworth Park South and the Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park. In 1795, the Spanish land grant had been issued for Rancho Simi, reconfirmed in 1842 by the Mexican governor. Its lands included part of current Chatsworth, westward from Andora Avenue. In 1821, after the Mexican War of Independence from Spain, the Mission San Fernando became part of Alta California, Mexico. In 1834, the Mexican government began redistributing the mission lands. In 1846, the Mexican land grant for Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando was issued by Governor P√≠o Pico. It was bounded on the north by Rancho San Francisco and the Santa Susana Mountains, on the west by the Simi Hills, on the east by Rancho Tujunga, and on the south by the Monta√±as de Portesuelo (Santa Monica Mountains). The Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando received a Federal land patent to retain ownership by the United States Public Land Commission in 1873 and was the single largest land grant in California. =United States= The center of Chatsworth, 1911, on what is now Topanga Canyon Boulevard In 1869, the grantee's son, Eulogio F. de Celis, returned from Spain to Los Angeles.Romantic Day, Pathetic End: Sad Burial of Once Wealthy Scion of Spain, Los Angeles Times, May 26, 1903, Eulogio F. de Celis In 1874, the family sold their northern half of Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando to northern Californians, California State Senator Charles Maclay and his partners George K. Porter, a San Francisco shoe manufacturer, and his brother Benjamin F. Porter. The Porters‚Äô land was west of present-day Sepulveda Boulevard including most of Chatsworth, and the Maclay land was east of Sepulveda Boulevard. The Old Santa Susana Stage Road or Santa Susana Wagon Road continued in use as an alternative to the route along El Camino Viejo from 1861 to 1875, replacing the older road as the main route between Los Angeles and San Francisco. In 1876, the Southern Pacific Railroad opened a tunnel through the Newhall Pass, enabling rail connections from Los Angeles north to San Francisco, and rail travel soon replaced travel by stagecoach between Los Angeles and San Francisco. From this time, the stagecoach traffic to Santa Barbara once again used the coast route, and the Santa Susana Pass road was relegated to local traffic. The Chatsworth name, which hails from the stately Chatsworth House in England, was first recorded in 1888, when George R. Crow filed with the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office a map of the San Fernando Valley with a subdivision he called \\"Chatsworth Park.\\" Later a W. B. Barber, the president of the San Fernando Valley Improvement Company who was believed to be from England, filed an additional map with the Recorder's Office called the \\"Plat of Chatsworth Park Townsite.\\" A new wagon route bypassing the deteriorating Devil's Slide was opened in 1895. Initially called El Camino Nuevo (the New Road), it was later named the Chatsworth Grade Road, which continued in use until Santa Susana Pass Road (now Old Santa Susana Pass Road) was built in 1917. Government and infrastructure The Chatsworth Branch Library, operated by the Los Angeles Public Library, is located at 21052 Devonshire Street. It was rebuilt in a modern style in 2002. The Chatsworth Post Office, of the United States Postal Service, is located at 21606 Devonshire Street. The U.S. Census Bureau operates the Los Angeles Regional Census Center in Chatsworth. =Transportation= The Chatsworth Transportation Center, a major transportation hub for the town and west valley, is served by 20 daily trains on the Metrolink Ventura County Line from Ventura to Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles. Amtrak California Pacific Surfliner has 10 trains daily traveling through here on the Coast Line which also handles freight transport by Union Pacific Railroad and was involved in the 2008 Chatsworth train collision near here. The Orange Line of the Los Angeles Metro system was extended to Chatsworth Station in 2012, with a dedicated right-of-way across the Valley to North Hollywood Station of the Red Line subway. The Chatsworth Transportation Center also offers connections to several Los Angeles Metro, Simi Valley, and Santa Clarita bus routes. It is located at 10046 Old Depot Plaza Road, between Devonshire and Lassen streets. Chatsworth is serviced by the 118 freeway in the northern end of the neighborhood. Education Thirty-four percent of Chatsworth residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, an average percentage for the city. =Schools= Schools within the Chatsworth boundaries are: Public Chatsworth High School * Chatsworth Senior High School, 10027 Lurline Avenue * William Tell Aggeler Opportunity High School, 21050 Plummer Street * Stoney Point Continuation School, 10010 De Soto Avenue * Ernest Lawrence Middle School, 10100 Variel Avenue * Germain Street Elementary School, 20730 Germain Street * Chatsworth Park Elementary School, 22005 Devonshire Street * Superior Street Elementary School, 9756 Oso Avenue Private * Sierra Canyon School, pre-kindergarten through 12, 20801 Rinaldi Street * Chatsworth Hills Academy, elementary, 21523 Rinaldi Street * St. Paul's Christian Academy, 21621 Heather Lee Lane * Al-Falaq / Me'raj Academy, elementary, 11070 Old Santa Susana Pass Road * Egremont Schools, Inc., elementary, 19850 Devonshire Street * Chaminade College Preparatory School, middle, 19800 Devonshire Street * St. John Eudes, elementary, 9925 Mason Avenue * Monarch Christian School,Monarch Christian School 22280 Devonshire Street Parks and recreation The City of Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department, California Department of Parks and Recreation, County of Los Angeles, California State Park Volunteers, and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy operate the various natural open space preserve parks and neighborhood recreation parks. =Open-space parks= West Chatsworth and the Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park, with the Old Santa Susana Stage Road in red * Chatsworth Park North: includes more than of the scenic Simi Hills and is operated by the Los Angeles Parks Department. has three baseball diamonds, football field, and outdoor basketball courts, all lighted; volleyball courts, a children's play area, hiking trails, a jogging path, and picnic tables with barbecue pits.

Chatsworth Park South is adjacent to the Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park, a National Register of Historic Places property consisting of historic features and deposits, prehistoric village site remnants, and portions of the Old Santa Susana Stage Road, which was the main route for mail and travelers between Los Angeles and San Francisco from 1861 until the opening of rail connections between the two cities in 1876. The stage route was also declared Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #92 (designated January 5, 1972) and Ventura County Historical Landmark #104 (designated October 21, 1986). The park has miles of horseback, jogging, and hiking trails, picnic tables and barbecue pits, and bouldering outcrops. ** Chatsworth Recreation Center facilities are located within the lower area of Chatsworth Park South, with lighted indoor basketball courts, lighted outdoor basketball courts, a children's play area, an indoor gymnasium, a stage, and lighted tennis courts. ** The Minnie Hill Palmer House, one of the West Valley's historic original homestead houses, is in Chatsworth Park South for visits and the Chatsworth Historical Society archives. ** The park has been closed since February 2008 due to contamination discovered from when the park used to be a shooting range for Roy Rogers. * Michael D.

The Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park protects and offers a historical site of the late 19th century, when Chatsworth was on a main thoroughfare for the figures of the American West. Joaquin Murrieta and his bandits hid out in the rocky crevices around Stoney Point. The Old Stagecoach Trail above Chatsworth to the west, is now a popular hiking trail in the Simi Hills. It goes through Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park and Chatsworth Park South and by Chatsworth Oaks Park. The State Park is open to the public with several parking and trailhead areas and many hiking and view opportunities. * Chatsworth Oaks Park: an approximately natural open space park. It has barbecue pits, a children's play area, and picnic tables near the parking area.

Built in 1918 as part of the Los Angeles Aqueduct system, the property belongs to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Due to increasing concerns of the water quality because of algae plumes and storm water inflow, it was taken out of service in August 1969. After the 1971 San Fernando earthquake additional concerns for seismic safety led to its abandonment by the LADWP as a storage facility. Chatsworth Oaks Park and the Chatsworth Nature Preserve are located here giving views of migrating birds and other animals, and their sounds such as the coyotes calling in the evening. The views of the rocky and dramatic Simi Hills surround the open space. Chatsworth Reservoir is classified by the Los Angeles Times as a city neighborhood, but \\"because there are relatively few homes in this area,\\" the Times does not provide separate statistics for it, but adds them to Chatsworth. The Devonshire and Topanga stations of the Los Angeles Police Department provide services in the area. Economy Chatsworth is the home of the National Notary Association and the headquarters for Premier America (formerly Litton Federal Credit Union) and Matadors Community Credit Union. The Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL), once busy with Rocketdyne testing rocket engines and Atomics International doing nuclear research, is quiet and high in the Simi Hills west of Chatsworth. It has been closed, will undergo an extensive environmental cleanup, and will become an open-space park. The park will permanently add to Chatsworth's scenic backdrop, greenway, and hiking opportunities. Some current businesses based in Chatsworth are Capstone Turbine, Natel Engineering, and Hydraulics International. Lamps Plus has production and distribution facilities here. Titus Software's United States subsidiary once had its headquarters in Chatsworth. Seltzer Motor Industries, of Chatsworth, in 1979 produced the Willow, a two-seat sports car kit. It is the first transverse, inline four-cylinder, mid-engined kit car ever offered to the public.Alexander, George (1983). Kit Car Encyclopedia. Fifth Genesis Publications. pp. 9-14. Aug.-Sep. 1983.

The tidal range (the peak-to-peak amplitude, or height difference between high tide and low tide) for that harmonic constituent increases with distance from this point. The term amphidromic point derives from the Greek words amphi (around) and dromos (running), referring to the rotary tides running around them.

Amphidromic system of the M2 constituent in the North Sea. The light-blue lines are lines of equal tidal phase for the vertical tide (surface elevation) along such a line, and the amphidromic points are denoted by 1, 2 and 3. Amphidromic points occur because the Coriolis effect and interference within oceanic basins, seas and bays creates a wave pattern ‚Äî called an amphidromic system ‚Äî which rotates around the amphidromic point.http://www.salemstate.edu/~lhanson/gls214/gls214_tides.html At the amphidromic points of the dominant tidal constituent, there is almost no vertical movement from tidal action. There can be tidal currents since the water levels on either side of the amphidromic point are not the same. A separate amphidromic system is created by each periodic tidal component. In most locations the \\"principal lunar semi-diurnal\\", known as M2, is the largest tidal constituent, with an amplitude of roughly half of the full tidal range. Having cotidal points means they reach high tide at the same time and low tide at the same time. In the accompanying figure, the low tide lags or leads by 1 hr 2 min from its neighboring lines. Where the lines meet are amphidromes, and the tide rotates around them; for example, along the Chilean coast, and from southern Mexico to Peru, the tide propagates southward, while from Baja California to Alaska the tide propagates northward.

Thus it can get the best features of a sorted array (for searching) while maintaining a linked list- like structure that allows insertion, which is not possible in an array. Fast search is made possible by maintaining a linked hierarchy of subsequences, with each successive subsequence skipping over fewer elements than the previous one (see the picture below on the right). Searching starts in the sparsest subsequence until two consecutive elements have been found, one smaller and one larger than or equal to the element searched for. Via the linked hierarchy, these two elements link to elements of the next sparsest subsequence, where searching is continued until finally we are searching in the full sequence. The elements that are skipped over may be chosen probabilistically or deterministically, with the former being more common.  Description  A schematic picture of the skip list data structure. Each box with an arrow represents a pointer and a row is a linked list giving a sparse subsequence; the numbered boxes (in yellow) at the bottom represent the ordered data sequence. Searching proceeds downwards from the sparsest subsequence at the top until consecutive elements bracketing the search element are found. A skip list is built in layers. The bottom layer is an ordinary ordered linked list. Each higher layer acts as an \\"express lane\\" for the lists below, where an element in layer i appears in layer i+1 with some fixed probability p (two commonly used values for p are 1/2 or 1/4). On average, each element appears in 1/(1-p) lists, and the tallest element (usually a special head element at the front of the skip list) in all the lists. The skip list contains \\\\log_{1/p}n\\\\, (i.e. logarithm base 1/p of n) lists. A search for a target element begins at the head element in the top list, and proceeds horizontally until the current element is greater than or equal to the target. If the current element is equal to the target, it has been found. If the current element is greater than the target, or the search reaches the end of the linked list, the procedure is repeated after returning to the previous element and dropping down vertically to the next lower list. The expected number of steps in each linked list is at most 1/p, which can be seen by tracing the search path backwards from the target until reaching an element that appears in the next higher list or reaching the beginning of the current list. Therefore, the total expected cost of a search is \\\\tfrac{1}{p}\\\\log_{1/p}n which is \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log n)\\\\,, when p is a constant. By choosing different values of p, it is possible to trade search costs against storage costs. = Implementation details = Inserting elements to skip list The elements used for a skip list can contain more than one pointer since they can participate in more than one list. Insertions and deletions are implemented much like the corresponding linked-list operations, except that \\"tall\\" elements must be inserted into or deleted from more than one linked list. \\\\mathcal{O}(n) operations, which force us to visit every node in ascending order (such as printing the entire list), provide the opportunity to perform a behind-the-scenes derandomization of the level structure of the skip-list in an optimal way, bringing the skip list to \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log n) search time. (Choose the level of the i'th finite node to be 1 plus the number of times we can repeatedly divide i by 2 before it becomes odd. Also, i=0 for the negative infinity header as we have the usual special case of choosing the highest possible level for negative and/or positive infinite nodes.) However this also allows someone to know where all of the higher-than-level 1 nodes are and delete them. Alternatively, we could make the level structure quasi- random in the following way: make all nodes level 1 j ‚Üê 1 while the number of nodes at level j > 1 do for each i'th node at level j do if i is odd and i is not the last node at level j randomly choose whether to promote it to level j+1 else if i is even and node i-1 was not promoted promote it to level j+1 end if repeat j ‚Üê j + 1 repeat Like the derandomized version, quasi- randomization is only done when there is some other reason to be running an \\\\mathcal{O}(n) operation (which visits every node). The advantage of this quasi-randomness is that it doesn't give away nearly as much level-structure related information to an adversarial user as the de-randomized one. This is desirable because an adversarial user who is able to tell which nodes are not at the lowest level can pessimize performance by simply deleting higher-level nodes. (Bethea and Reiter however argue that nonetheless an adversary can use probabilistic and timing methods to force performance degradation.) The search performance is still guaranteed to be logarithmic. It would be tempting to make the following \\"optimization\\": In the part which says \\"Next, for each ith...\\", forget about doing a coin-flip for each even-odd pair. Just flip a coin once to decide whether to promote only the even ones or only the odd ones. Instead of \\\\mathcal{O}(n \\\\log n) coin flips, there would only be \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log n) of them. Unfortunately, this gives the adversarial user a 50/50 chance of being correct upon guessing that all of the even numbered nodes (among the ones at level 1 or higher) are higher than level one. This is despite the property that he has a very low probability of guessing that a particular node is at level N for some integer N. A skip list does not provide the same absolute worst-case performance guarantees as more traditional balanced tree data structures, because it is always possible (though with very low probability) that the coin-flips used to build the skip list will produce a badly balanced structure. However, they work well in practice, and the randomized balancing scheme has been argued to be easier to implement than the deterministic balancing schemes used in balanced binary search trees. Skip lists are also useful in parallel computing, where insertions can be done in different parts of the skip list in parallel without any global rebalancing of the data structure. Such parallelism can be especially advantageous for resource discovery in an ad-hoc wireless network because a randomized skip list can be made robust to the loss of any single node. = Indexable skiplist = As described above, a skip list is capable of fast \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log n) insertion and removal of values from a sorted sequence, but it has only slow \\\\mathcal{O}(n) lookups of values at a given position in the sequence (i.e. return the 500th value); however, with a minor modification the speed of random access indexed lookups can be improved to \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log n). For every link, also store the width of the link. The width is defined as the number of bottom layer links being traversed by each of the higher layer \\"express lane\\" links. For example, here are the widths of the links in the example at the top of the page: 1 10 o---> o---------------------------------------------------------> o Top level 1 3 2 5 o---> o---------------> o---------> o---------------------------> o Level 3 1 2 1 2 3 2 o---> o---------> o---> o---------> o---------------> o---------> o Level 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 o---> o---> o---> o---> o---> o---> o---> o---> o---> o---> o---> o Bottom level Head 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 10th NIL Node Node Node Node Node Node Node Node Node Node Notice that the width of a higher level link is the sum of the component links below it (i.e. the width 10 link spans the links of widths 3, 2 and 5 immediately below it). Consequently, the sum of all widths is the same on every level (10 + 1 = 1 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2). To index the skip list and find the i'th value, traverse the skip list while counting down the widths of each traversed link. Descend a level whenever the upcoming width would be too large. For example, to find the node in the fifth position (Node 5), traverse a link of width 1 at the top level. Now four more steps are needed but the next width on this level is ten which is too large, so drop one level. Traverse one link of width 3. Since another step of width 2 would be too far, drop down to the bottom level. Now traverse the final link of width 1 to reach the target running total of 5 (1+3+1). function lookupByPositionIndex(i) node ‚Üê head i ‚Üê i + 1 # don't count the head as a step for level from top to bottom do while i ‚â• node.width[level] do # if next step is not too far i ‚Üê i - node.width[level] # subtract the current width node ‚Üê node.next[level] # traverse forward at the current level repeat repeat return node.value end function This method of implementing indexing is detailed in Section 3.4 Linear List Operations in \\"A skip list cookbook\\" by William Pugh. History Skip lists were first described in 1989 by William Pugh. To quote the author: :Skip lists are a probabilistic data structure that seem likely to supplant balanced trees as the implementation method of choice for many applications. Skip list algorithms have the same asymptotic expected time bounds as balanced trees and are simpler, faster and use less space. Usages List of applications and frameworks that use skip lists: *Apache Portable Runtime implements skip lists. See APR 1.6 documentation *MemSQL uses lock-free skip lists as its prime indexing structure for its database technology. *Cyrus IMAP server offers a \\"skiplist\\" backend DB implementation (source file) *Lucene uses skip lists to search delta-encoded posting lists in logarithmic time. *QMap (up to Qt 4) template class of Qt that provides a dictionary. *Redis, an ANSI-C open- source persistent key/value store for Posix systems, uses skip lists in its implementation of ordered sets. *nessDB, a very fast key-value embedded Database Storage Engine (Using log-structured-merge (LSM) trees), uses skip lists for its memtable. *skipdb is an open-source database format using ordered key/value pairs. *ConcurrentSkipListSet and ConcurrentSkipListMap in the Java 1.6 API. Used by Apache HBase. *Speed Tables are a fast key-value datastore for Tcl that use skiplists for indexes and lockless shared memory. *leveldb, a fast key-value storage library written at Google that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values *Con Kolivas' MuQSS Scheduler for the Linux kernel uses skip lists *SkiMap uses skip lists as base data structure to build a more complex 3D Sparse Grid for Robot Mapping systems. *IOWOW, a persistent C11 key/value storage library uses skip lists as its main data structure. Skip lists are used for efficient statistical computations of running medians (also known as moving medians). Skip lists are also used in distributed applications (where the nodes represent physical computers, and pointers represent network connections) and for implementing highly scalable concurrent priority queues with less lock contention, or even without locking, as well as lockless concurrent dictionaries. There are also several US patents for using skip lists to implement (lockless) priority queues and concurrent dictionaries.

The games began three days after the close of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Context This was the first time global politics interfered with the Paralympic Games. \\"The problem stemmed from the logic that admitting a team from South Africa was to give implicit approval for its government's attitude towards segregation and racism.\\" Although the South African team at the time was a multi-racial one, the Canadian government withdrew its half million dollar contribution and \\"matching amounts of funds were likely to be pulled out by the metropolitan government\\". The provincial government at Queen's Park eventually covered the tab. Two groups, both with the same President - Ludwig Guttmann - were involved in the decision-making: the International Sports Organisation for the Disabled and the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation. Guttman and Bob Jackson, Chairman of the Organizing Committee, worked to convince the governments to honour their promises of support and were largely successful. Nevertheless, a number of teams withdrew, following on from the Montreal boycott by 25 countries, and those teams were threatened with exclusion from future events. Later, efforts were made to develop a joint policy with the International Olympic Committee. Rhodesia was not allowed to participate as the Canadian government refused to grant visas for the Rhodesian Paralympic team to attend the competition. Venues The opening of the 1976 games was held at Woodbine Race Track in north Etobicoke. There was no athletes' village, so competitors were housed at York University (Keele campus), University of Toronto (St. George Campus), and the CNIB (national headquarters in Toronto). Israeli athletes were housed at an undisclosed hotel due to security concerns. Closing ceremonies and outdoor events (mainly track and field) took place at Centennial Park Stadium. Centennial Gymnasium and Centennial Park's Olympic Pool (Etobicoke Olympium) were the other venues (for indoor and swimming events respectively). Media coverage The 1976 games marked the first television coverage of Paralympic events. Performances were shown to viewers in Southern Ontario.

Jute rope Jute is a long, soft, shiny bast fiber that can be spun into coarse, strong threads. It is produced primarily from plants in the genus Corchorus, which was once classified with the family Tiliaceae. The primary source of the fiber is Corchorus olitorius, but it is considered inferior to Corchorus capsularis. \\"Jute\\" is the name of the plant or fiber used to make burlap, hessian or gunny cloth. Jute is one of the most affordable natural fibers, and second only to cotton in the amount produced and variety of uses. Jute fibers are composed primarily of the plant materials cellulose and lignin. It falls into the bast fiber category (fiber collected from bast, the phloem of the plant, sometimes called the \\"skin\\") along with kenaf, industrial hemp, flax (linen), ramie, etc. The industrial term for jute fiber is raw jute. The fibers are off-white to brown, and 1‚Äì4 metres (3‚Äì13 feet) long. Jute is also called the \\"golden fiber\\" for its color and high cash value.  Cultivation  Jute plants (Corchorus olitorius and Corchorus capsularis) The jute plant needs a plain alluvial soil and standing water. The suitable climate for growing jute (warm and wet) is offered by the monsoon climate, during the monsoon season. Temperatures from and relative humidity of 70%‚Äì80% are favourable for successful cultivation. Jute requires of rainfall weekly, and more during the sowing time. Soft water is necessary for jute production. =White jute (Corchorus capsularis)= Historical documents (including Ain-e-Akbari by Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak in 1590) state that the poor villagers of India used to wear clothes made of jute. The weavers used simple hand spinning wheels and hand looms, and spun cotton yarns as well. History also suggests that Indians, especially Bengalis, used ropes and twines made of white jute from ancient times for household and other uses. It is highly functional for carrying grains or other agricultural products. =Tossa jute (Corchorus olitorius)= Tossa jute (Corchorus olitorius) is a variety thought native to South Asia. It is grown for both fiber and culinary purposes. People use the leaves as an ingredient in a mucilaginous potherb called \\"molokhiya\\" (, of uncertain etymology). It is popular in some Arabian countries such as Egypt, Jordan, and Syria as a soup-based dish, sometimes with meat over rice or lentils. The Book of Job (chapter 30, verse 4), in the King James translation of the Hebrew Bible malua·∏• \\"salty\\",The New Bantam-Megiddo Hebrew & English Dictionary, Sivan and Levenston, Bantam books, NY, 1875 mentions this vegetable potherb as \\"mallow, giving rise to the term Jew's Mallow. It is high in protein, vitamin C, beta-carotene, calcium, and iron. Bangladesh and other countries in Southeast Asia, and the South Pacific mainly use jute for its fiber. Tossa jute fiber is softer, silkier, and stronger than white jute. This variety shows good sustainability in the Ganges Delta climate. Along with white jute, tossa jute has also been cultivated in the soil of Bengal where it is known as paat from the start of the 19th century. Coremantel, Bangladesh, is the largest global producer of the tossa jute variety. History Jute was used for making textiles in the Indus valley civilization since the 3rd millennium BC. In classical antiquity, Pliny recorded that jute plants were used as food in Ancient Egypt. It may have also been cultivated by the Jews in the Near East, which gives the plant its name. For centuries, jute has been an integral part of the culture of East Bengal and some parts of West Bengal, precisely in the southwest of Bangladesh. Since the seventeenth century the British started trading in jute. During the reign of the British Empire, jute was also used in the military. British jute barons grew rich by processing jute and selling manufactured products made from it. Dundee Jute Barons and the British East India Company set up many jute mills in Bengal, and by 1895 jute industries in Bengal overtook the Scottish jute trade. Many Scots emigrated to Bengal to set up jute factories. More than a billion jute sandbags were exported from Bengal to the trenches of World War I, and to the United States south to bag cotton. It was used in the fishing, construction, art and the arms industries. Initially, due to its texture, it could only be processed by hand until someone in Dundee discovered that treating it with whale oil made it machine processable. The industry boomed throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (\\"jute weaver\\" was a recognised trade occupation in the 1900 UK census), but this trade had largely ceased by about 1970 due to the emergence of synthetic fibers. In the 21st century, jute again has become an important export crop around the world, mainly in Bangladesh. Production retted in water to separate the fibers The jute fiber comes from the stem and ribbon (outer skin) of the jute plant. The fibers are first extracted by retting. The retting process consists of bundling jute stems together and immersing them in slow running water. There are two types of retting: stem and ribbon. After the retting process, stripping begins; women and children usually do this job. In the stripping process, non-fibrous matter is scraped off, then the workers dig in and grab the fibers from within the jute stem. Jute is a rain-fed crop with little need for fertilizer or pesticides, in contrast to cotton's heavy requirements. Production is concentrated mostly in Bangladesh, as well as India's states of Assam, Bihar, and West Bengal. India is the world's largest producer of jute, but imported approximately 162,000 tonnes of raw fiber and 175,000 tonnes of jute products in 2011. India, Pakistan, and China import significant quantities of jute fiber and products from Bangladesh, as do the United Kingdom, Japan, United States, France, Spain, Ivory Coast, Germany and Brazil. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:right;\\" border=\\"1\\" + Top ten jute producers, by metric ton, as of 2014 - ! scope=\\"col\\" Country ! scope=\\"col\\" Production (Tonnes) - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 1,968,000 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 1,349,000 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" 29,628 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 20,000 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 14,890 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" 3,300 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2,519 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2,508 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" 1,172 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 970 -style=\\"background:#ccc;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background:#ccc;text- align:left;\\"World  3,393,248 } Genome At the beginning of the 21st century, in 2002 Bangladesh commissioned a consortium of researchers from University of Dhaka, Bangladesh Jute Research Institute (BJRI) and private software firm DataSoft Systems Bangladesh Ltd., in collaboration with Centre for Chemical Biology, University of Science Malaysia and University of Hawaii, to research different fibers and hybrid fibers of jute. The draft genome of jute (Corchorus olitorius) was completed. Uses Making twine, rope, and matting are among its uses. In combination with sugar, the possibility of using jute to build aeroplane panels has been considered. Jute is in great demand due to its cheapness, softness, length, lustre and uniformity of its fiber. It is called the 'brown paper bag' as it is also the most used product in gunny sacks to store rice, wheat, grains, etc. It is also called the \\"golden fiber\\" due to its versatile nature. =Fibers= Jute fabric Coffee sacks made of jute. Jute fiber is extracted from retted stem of jute plants Jute matting is used to prevent flood erosion while natural vegetation becomes established. For this purpose, a natural and biodegradable fiber is essential. Jute is the second most important vegetable fiber after cotton due to its versatility. Jute is used chiefly to make cloth for wrapping bales of raw cotton, and to make sacks and coarse cloth. The fibers are also woven into curtains, chair coverings, carpets, area rugs, hessian cloth, and backing for linoleum. While jute is being replaced by synthetic materials in many of these uses, some uses take advantage of jute's biodegradable nature, where synthetics would be unsuitable. Examples of such uses include containers for planting young trees, which can be planted directly with the container without disturbing the roots, and land restoration where jute cloth prevents erosion occurring while natural vegetation becomes established. The fibers are used alone or blended with other types of fiber to make twine and rope. Jute butts, the coarse ends of the plants, are used to make inexpensive cloth. Conversely, very fine threads of jute can be separated out and made into imitation silk. As jute fibers are also being used to make pulp and paper, and with increasing concern over forest destruction for the wood pulp used to make most paper, the importance of jute for this purpose may increase. Jute has a long history of use in the sackings, carpets, wrapping fabrics (cotton bale), and construction fabric manufacturing industry. Jute was used in traditional textile machinery as fibers having cellulose (vegetable fiber content) and lignin (wood fiber content). But, the major breakthrough came when the automobile, pulp and paper, and the furniture and bedding industries started to use jute and its allied fibers with their non-woven and composite technology to manufacture nonwovens, technical textiles, and composites. Therefore, jute has changed its textile fiber outlook and steadily heading towards its newer identity, i.e., wood fiber. As a textile fiber, jute has reached its peak from where there is no hope of progress, but as a wood fiber jute has many promising features. Jute is used in the manufacture of a number of fabrics, such as Hessian cloth, sacking, scrim, carpet backing cloth (CBC), and canvas. Hessian, lighter than sacking, is used for bags, wrappers, wall-coverings, upholstery, and home furnishings. Sacking, a fabric made of heavy jute fibers, has its use in the name. CBC made of jute comes in two types. Primary CBC provides a tufting surface, while secondary CBC is bonded onto the primary backing for an overlay. Jute packaging is used as an eco-friendly substitute. Diversified jute products are becoming more and more valuable to the consumer today. Among these are espadrilles, soft sweaters and cardigans, floor coverings, home textiles, high performance technical textiles, geotextiles, composites, and more. Jute floor coverings consist of woven and tufted and piled carpets. Jute mats and mattings with 5/6 mts width and of continuous length are easily being woven in southern parts of India, in solid and fancy shades, and in different weaves, like boucl√©, Panama, herringbone, etc. Jute mats and rugs are made both by powerloom and handloom in large volume in Kerala, India. The traditional Satranji mat is becoming very popular in home d√©cor. Jute non- wovens and composites can be used for underlay, linoleum substrate, and more. Jute has many advantages as a home textile, either replacing cotton or blending with it. It is a strong, durable, color and light-fast fiber. Its UV protection, sound and heat insulation, low thermal conduction and anti-static properties make it a wise choice in home d√©cor. Also, fabrics made of jute fibers are carbon-dioxide neutral and naturally decomposable. These properties are also why jute can be used in high performance technical textiles. Moreover, jute can be grown in 4‚Äì6 months with a huge amount of cellulose being produced from the jute hurd (inner woody core or parenchyma of the jute stem) that can meet most of the wood needs of the world. Thus, jute is the most environment-friendly fiber starting from the seed to expired fiber, as the expired fibers can be recycled more than once. Jute is also used to make ghillie suits, which are used as camouflage and resemble grasses or brush. Another diversified jute product is geotextiles, which made this agricultural commodity more popular in the agricultural sector. It is a lightly woven fabric made from natural fibers that is used for soil erosion control, seed protection, weed control, and many other agricultural and landscaping uses. The geotextiles can be used more than a year and the bio-degradable jute geotextile left to rot on the ground keeps the ground cool and is able to make the land more fertile. =Culinary uses= Corchous olitorius leaves are used to make mulukhiya, sometimes considered the Egyptian national dish, but consumed in Cyprus and other Middle Eastern countries as well. It is an ingredient for stews, typically cooked with lamb or chicken. In Nigeria, leaves of Corchorus olitorius are prepared in sticky soup called ewedu together with ingredients such as sweet potato, dried small fish or shrimp.AVRDC. Recipes - African Sticky Soup (Ewedu). Retrieved 27 June 2013. The leaves are rubbed until foamy or sticky before adding to the soup. Amongst the Yoruba of Nigeria, the leaves are called Ewedu, and in the Hausa-speaking northern Nigeria, the leaves are called turgunuwa or lallo. The cook cuts jute leaves into shreds and adds them to the soup, which normally also contains ingredients such as meat or fish, pepper, onions, and spices. Likewise, the Lugbara of Northwestern Uganda eat the leaves in a soup they call pala bi. Jute is also a totem for Ayivu, one of the Lugbara clans. In the Philippines, especially in Ilocano-dominated areas, this vegetable, locally known as saluyot, can be mixed with either bitter gourd, bamboo shoots, loofah, or sometimes all of them. These have a slimy and slippery texture. =Other= Jute stalks drying under the sun for use as fuel. Diversified byproducts from jute can be used in cosmetics, medicine, paints, and other products. Features Cutting lower part of the long jute fiber. The lower part is hard fiber, which is called jute cuttings in Bangladesh and India (commonly called jute butts or jute tops elsewhere). Jute cuttings are lower in quality, but have commercial value for the paper, carded yarn, and other fiber processing industries. Jute fibers are kept in bundles in the background in a warehouse in Bangladesh. * Jute fiber is 100% bio-degradable and recyclable and thus environmentally friendly. * Jute has low pesticide and fertilizer needs. * It is a natural fiber with golden and silky shine and hence called the golden fiber. * It is the cheapest vegetable fiber procured from the bast or skin of the plant's stem. * It is the second most important vegetable fiber after cotton, in terms of usage, global consumption, production, and availability. * It has high tensile strength, low extensibility, and ensures better breathability of fabrics. Therefore, jute is very suitable in agricultural commodity bulk packaging. * It helps to make top quality industrial yarn, fabric, net, and sacks. It is one of the most versatile natural fibers that has been used in raw materials for packaging, textiles, non-textile, construction, and agricultural sectors. Bulking of yarn results in a reduced breaking tenacity and an increased breaking extensibility when blended as a ternary blend. * Advantages of jute include good insulating and antistatic properties, as well as having low thermal conductivity and a moderate moisture regain. Other advantages of jute include acoustic insulating properties and manufacture with no skin irritations. * Jute can be blended with other fibers, both synthetic and natural, and accepts cellulosic dye classes such as natural, basic, vat, sulfur, reactive, and pigment dyes. As demand for natural comfort fibers increases, demand for jute and other natural fibers that can be blended with cotton will increase. To meet this demand, some manufactures in the natural fiber industry plan to modernize processing with the Rieter's Elitex system. Resulting jute/cotton yarns produce fabrics with a reduced cost of wet processing treatments. Jute can also be blended with wool. By treating jute with caustic soda, crimp, softness, pliability, and appearance is improved, aiding in its ability to be spun with wool. Liquid ammonia has a similar effect on jute, as well as the added characteristic of improving flame resistance when treated with flameproofing agents. * Some noted disadvantages include poor drapability and crease resistance, brittleness, fiber shedding, and yellowing in sunlight. However, preparation of fabrics with castor oil lubricants result in less yellowing and less fabric weight loss, as well as increased dyeing brilliance. Jute has a decreased strength when wet, and also becomes subject to microbial attack in humid climates. Jute can be processed with an enzyme to reduce some of its brittleness and stiffness. Once treated with an enzyme, jute shows an affinity to readily accept natural dyes, which can be made from marigold flower extract. In one attempt to dye jute fabric with this extract, bleached fabric was mordanted with ferrous sulphate, increasing the fabric's dye uptake value. Jute also responds well to reactive dyeing. This process is used for bright and fast coloured value-added diversified products made from jute.

A charter is the grant of authority or rights, stating that the granter formally recognizes the prerogative of the recipient to exercise the rights specified. It is implicit that the granter retains superiority (or sovereignty), and that the recipient admits a limited (or inferior) status within the relationship, and it is within that sense that charters were historically granted, and it is that sense which is retained in modern usage of the term. The word entered the English language from the Old French charte, via Latin charta, and ultimately from Greek œáŒ¨œÅœÑŒ∑œÇ (khartes, meaning \\"layer of papyrus\\"). It has come to be synonymous with a document that sets out a grant of rights or privileges.  Other usages  The term is used for a special case (or as an exception) of an institutional charter. A charter school, for example, is one that has different rules, regulations, and statutes from a state school. Charter can be used as a synonym for \\"hire\\" or \\"lease\\", as in the \\"charter\\" of a bus or boat or plane. A charter member (US English) of an organization is an original member; that is, one who became a member when the organization received its charter. A chartered member (British English) is a member who holds an individual chartered designation authorized under that organization's royal charter. Different types of charters =Anglo-Saxon charters= Anglo-Saxon charters are documents from the early medieval period in Britain which typically make a grant of land or record a privilege. They are usually written on parchment, in Latin but often with sections in the vernacular, describing the bounds of estates, which often correspond closely to modern parish boundaries. The earliest surviving charters were drawn up in the 670s; the oldest surviving charters granted land to the Church, but from the 8th century surviving charters were increasingly used to grant land to lay people. =Charter colony= The British Empire used three main types of colonies as it sought to expand its territory to distant parts of the earth. These three types were royal colonies, proprietary colonies, and corporate colonies. A charter colony by definition is a \\"colony chartered to an individual, trading company, etc., by the British crown.\\"charter colony - Definitions from Dictionary.com Although charter colonies were not the most prevalent of the three types of colonies in the British Empire, they were by no means insignificant. =Congressional charter= A congressional charter is a law passed by the United States Congress that states the mission, authority, and activities of a group. Congress issued federal charters from 1791 until 1992 under Title 36 of the United States Code. =Municipal charter= A municipal corporation is the legal term for a local governing body, including (but not necessarily limited to) cities, counties, towns, townships, charter townships, villages, and boroughs. Municipal incorporation occurs when such municipalities become self- governing entities under the laws of the state or province in which they are located. Often, this event is marked by the award or declaration of a municipal charter, a term used because municipal power was historically granted by the sovereign, by royal charter. = Order charter = Charters for chivalric orders and other orders, such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. =Project charter= In project management, a project charter or project definition (sometimes called the terms of reference) is provided by the sponsor to formally authorize the existence of a project. It provides a preliminary delineation of roles and responsibilities, outlines the project purpose and objectives, identifies key stakeholders, and defines the authority of the project manager. It serves as a reference of authority for future planning of the project. The project scope is developed from the project charter. =Royal charter= In medieval Europe, royal charters were used to create cities (i.e., localities with recognised legal rights and privileges). The date that such a charter was granted is considered to be when a city was \\"founded\\", regardless of when the locality originally began to be settled. The Charter of 1814, France‚Äôs constitution during the Bourbon Restoration, was thus called to promote the legal fiction that the King had granted it ‚Äúvoluntarily, and by the free exercise of [his] royal authority‚Äù, in the manner of medieval charters. At one time a royal charter was the only way in which an incorporated body could be formed, but other means (such as the registration process for limited companies) are generally now used instead. =Inspeximus charter= A charter of \\"Inspeximus\\" (Latin, literally \\"We have inspected\\") is frequently a royal charter, by which an earlier charter or series of charters relating to a particular foundation (such as a monastery or a guild) was recited and incorporated into a new charter, usually in order to confirm and renew its validity under present authority. Where the original documents are lost, an inspeximus charter may sometimes preserve their texts and lists of witnesses.

The term implied female sexual promiscuity or work in prostitution, young women who became pregnant outside of marriage, or young girls and teenagers who did not have familial support. They were required to work as part of their board, and the institutions operated large commercial laundries, serving customers outside their bases. Many of these \\"laundries\\" were effectively operated as penitentiary work-houses. The strict regimes in the institutions were often more severe than those found in prisons. This contradicted the perceived outlook that they were meant to treat the women as opposed to punishing them. \\"The heat was unbelievable. You couldn‚Äôt leave your station unless a bell went.\\" Laundries such as this operated in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Canada, the United States, and Australia, for much of the nineteenth and well into the twentieth century, the last one closing in 1996. The institutions were named after the Biblical figure Mary Magdalene, in earlier centuries characterised as a reformed prostitute. The first Magdalene institution was founded in late 1758 in Whitechapel, England. A similar institution was established in Ireland by 1767. The first Magdalene asylum in the United States was the Magdalen Society of Philadelphia, founded in 1800. All these were Protestant institutions. Other cities followed, especially from around 1800, with Catholic institutions also being opened. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Magdalene asylums were common in several countries. By 1900, there were more than 300 asylums in England and more than 20 in Scotland. Magdalene laundries by country =England, Scotland, and Wales (1758)= The first Magdalen institution, Magdalen Hospital for the Reception of Penitent Prostitutes, was founded in late 1758 in Whitechapel, London by Robert Dingley, a silk merchant, Jonas Hanway and John Fielding. The women worked at services and crafts to help provide financial support for the house. They were also given a small sum of money for their work. Additional income was generated by promoting the house as a tourist attraction for the upper classes. Horace Walpole, Fourth Earl of Orford, described staging one of these entertainments. This was in keeping with visits to Bethlem Royal Hospital and the Foundling Hospital. It later moved to Streatham, and could eventually house about 140 women, admitted between the ages of 15 and 40. Bristol (40 women) followed in 1800, Bath (79) in 1805, and many other cities in the years following, though their names mostly no longer included \\"Magdalene\\". Historians estimate that by the late 1800s, there were more than 300 Magdalen Institutions in England alone. In 1797, the Edinburgh Royal Magdalene Asylum was founded in the Canongate in Old Town, a popular location for street prostitutes. Some of the women were drawn to the city by industrialisation, some were pregnant and some had been forced into prostitution. Mary Paterson, (also known as Mary Mitchell) was murdered by William Burke shortly after leaving the institution on April 8 1828. The Edinburgh asylum moved to Dalry around 1842. The programme was supported in part by laundry and sewing work done by the residents. In Glasgow, the Magdalene Asylum became the Magdalene Institute and functioned until 1958. The writer Charles Dickens and the philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts set up an alternative in 1846, thinking the Magdalen Hospitals too harsh. At Urania Cottage the young women were prepared for re- entry into mainstream society, or for emigration to the colonies. By the late 1800s, many of the institutions had departed from the original model and resembled penitentiary work-houses. However, as these were viewed as commercial workshops and factories, they were subject to labour regulations and inspections. The Factory Act (1901) limited working hours for girls of thirteen to eighteen years of age to twelve hours a day. Magdalene laundries, in one format or another, were found in many of the major industrial centres of England and Wales, examples including the Convent of the Good Shepherd at Penylan, Cardiff. This was a common name for such institutions. =Ireland (1765)= Irish asylum, early twentieth century The first laundry or asylum, an Anglican or Church of Ireland-run institution, Magdalen Asylum for Penitent Females, opened in Ireland on Leeson Street in Dublin in 1767, after two years of preparation. It was founded by Lady Arabella Denny, and admitted only Protestant women. The last Magdalene Laundry closed on 25 September 1996 in Waterford City in Ireland. This building has been adapted for use as the Waterford Institute of Technology. Around 1805, John England of Cork, established a female reformatory together with male and female poor schools. Pending the opening of the Magdalen Asylum at Cork, he maintained and ministered to many applicants. The Church of Ireland Magdalene Asylum in Cork (Sawmill Street) opened in 1810. In Belfast, in Northern Ireland, the Church of Ireland-run Ulster Magdalene Asylum was founded in 1839, it closed in 1916. Parallel institutions were run by Roman Catholics and Presbyterians. Ferriter described the laundries as \\"a mechanism that society, religious orders and the state came up with to try to get rid of people deemed not to conforming to the so-called‚Ä¶ Irish identity.\\" The Irish government claimed that the State was not legally responsible for the abuse suffered by women and girls in the Magdalene Laundries, as these were religious institutions. The discovery in 1993 of a mass grave on the grounds of a former convent in Dublin led to media articles about the operations of the institutions. Ultimately the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child called for a government inquiry into the Magdalene laundries. A formal state apology was issued in 2013, and a ‚Ç¨60 million compensation scheme for survivors was set up. By 2011, the four religious institutes that ran the Irish asylums had not yet contributed to compensate survivors of abuse, despite demands from the Irish government, and the UN Committee Against Torture. The religious sisters continue to care for more than 100 elderly Magdalene women who remain in their care. An estimated 600 survivors were still alive in March 2014. Senator Martin McAleese chaired an Inter-Departmental Committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen laundries. An Interim Report was released in October 2011. In 2013 the BBC did a special investigation, Sue Lloyd-Roberts' \\"Demanding justice for women and children abused by Irish nuns.\\" The Magdalene Sisters, a 2002 film by Peter Mullan, is based on historical facts about four young women incarcerated in a Magdalene laundry in Ireland from 1964 to 1968. In 2011 a monument was erected in Ennis, County Clare, dedicated to the Sisters of Mercy, who had an industrial school and a Magdalene Laundry in the town. In 2015 Ennis municipal council decided to honour the same order by renaming a road in recognition of their compassionate service to vulnerable women and children. The road runs through the site of the former industrial school and laundry. People are divided about these honours. =United States (1800)= The first Magdalene asylum in the United States was the Magdalen Society of Philadelphia, founded in 1800. Other North American cities, including New York, Boston, Chicago, and Toronto, quickly followed suit. Asylum records show that in the early history of the Magdalene movement, many women entered and left the institutions of their own accord, sometimes repeatedly. Lu Ann De Cunzo wrote in her book, Reform, Respite, Ritual: An Archaeology of Institutions; The Magdalene Society of Philadelphia, 1800‚Äì1850,review of this published in Historical Archeology, the journal of the Society for Historical Archaeology that the women in Philadelphia's asylum \\"sought a refuge and a respite from disease, the prison or almshouse, unhappy family situations, abusive men, and dire economic circumstances.\\" In its early years, the Magdalen Society Asylum functioned as a refuge for prostitutes. Most of these stayed a few days or a few weeks, just long enough to get reclothed and recuperated. Attempts at rehabilitation met with little success. In 1877, the asylum was changed into a home for \\"wayward girls\\", with a rule requiring a stay for twelve months. As the Magdalen Society Asylum became more selective, relaxed its emphasis on personal guilt and salvation, and standardized the treatment of inmates, its rate of failure diminished. The Penitent Females' Refuge Society of Boston was incorporated in 1823. New York's Magdalen Society was established in 1830 with the purpose of rescuing women from lives of prostitution and vice. Advocates of women sometimes kidnapped them from brothels. In 1907 a new home was established in the Inwood section of upper Manhattan. The Society had twice moved to a larger facility. Many of the young women who were temporary residents at the Inwood institution had worked in the taverns, brothels, and alleyways of lower Manhattan before being \\"rescued\\" by the Society. Girls were generally committed for a period of three years. Through the years, several girls died or were injured climbing out of windows in failed escape attempts. In 1917, the Magdalen Benevolent Society changed its name to Inwood House. In the early 1920s, bichloride of mercury was commonly used to treat new arrivals for venereal disease, as penicillin was not yet available. Some women suffered mercury poisoning, as happened with patients on the outside. The property was later sold and the agency relocated. Inwood House continues to operate, with its main focus on teen pregnancy. =Canada (1848)= The Congregation of the Sisters of Misericorde was founded in Montreal in 1848 by Marie-Rosalie Cadron-Jett√©, a widow skilled as a midwife. Their network of asylums developed from their care of unmarried pregnant women until after they gave birth. In this period, unmarried women were encouraged to give their illegitimate children up for adoption. The Misericordia Sisters endeavored to carry out their ministry discreetly, for the public was neither supportive of their cause nor charitable to the young women they aided. The sisters were accused of \\"encouraging vice\\". The order was particularly sensitive to the social stigma attached to a woman who had borne an illegitimate child. The sisters perceived that, by precluding other employment, this stigma often tended to force a woman into prostitution, and in some cases infanticide. According to Sulpician Father √âric Sylvestre, \\"When food was scarce, Rosalie would fast so that the moms could eat. She was fond of saying that 'Single mothers are the treasure of the house.'\\" \\"In receiving patients no discrimination is made in regard to religion, colour, or nationality. After their convalescence, those who desire to remain in the home are placed under a special sister and are known as 'Daughters of St. Margaret'. They follow a certain rule of life but contract no religious obligations. Should they desire to remain in the convent, after a period of probation, they are allowed to become Magdalens and eventually make the vows of the Magdalen institute.\\" In 1858, Elizabeth Dunlop and others founded the Toronto Magdalene Laundries, with the stated goal of \\"eliminating prostitution by rehabilitating prostitutes\\". =Sweden (1852)= In Sweden, the first Magdalene asylum (Magdalenahem) was founded in Stockholm in 1852 by the philanthropist Emilie Elmblad. By 1900, there were eight asylums in Sweden, of which half were managed by the Salvation Army. The purpose of the asylums was to educate or train former female prostitutes in a different occupation, to make it possible for them to support themselves when they left the asylum. In practice, they were trained in domestic occupations in the asylums. The asylums tried to place former residents as domestic servants in private homes, preferably with religious employers. In this period, many people still worked as domestic servants, and women especially had limited work opportunities. As the asylums were normally managed by religious women philanthropists such as Elsa Borg, the goal was not only to provide them with employment but to encourage their religious practice, which was thought to help them avoid returning to prostitution. The asylums provided the clients with factory work only if the first choice of being a domestic in a private religious home failed. Employment in a public establishment, such as a hotel or a restaurant, was considered the least desirable choice, as such work was considered to be a great risk for women in terms of reentering prostitution. This was in line with several other common private charitable establishments especially in Stockholm, which provided poor women in the cities with shelter and employment (normally as domestics), to prevent them from becoming prostitutes. The asylums were charity institutions and founded in great part by the work of the women in domestic training there. Initially, women were paid for their work. This practice was abandoned when overseers concluded that it made women less inclined to follow rules. In Sweden, the majority of the inmates of the Magdalena asylums had voluntarily committed themselves, seeking help. There were known cases of women being committed by her family or by authorities. The Magdalena Asylum in Stockholm was closed in 1895. =Australia (1890)= From the early 1890s to the 1960s, most Australian state capitals had a large Roman Catholic convent that contained a commercial laundry where the work was done by the mostly teenage girls who were placed in the convent. They were committed, voluntarily or involuntarily, for reasons such as being destitute, \\"uncontrollable\\" as judged by family members or picked up by the police. According to James Franklin, the girls came from a variety of very disturbed and deprived backgrounds and were individually hard to deal with in many cases. Laundry work was regarded as suitable as part of the work program for the girls, as it did not require much training nor substantial capital expense. Former inmates consistently have reported negative memories of conditions in the convent laundries, detailing verbal abuse by nuns and other supervisors, and very hard physical work under difficult conditions. In accordance with the traditions of the nuns, much of the day proceeded in silence. Like orphanages, these institutions received almost no government funds. As in any underfunded institution, the food was described as bland. The nuns shared the conditions of the women inmates, such as bad food, hard work, the confinement, and the long periods of silence. Education for residents was either of poor quality or lacking altogether. The sisters had no physical contact with the girls, nor emotional contact in the sense of listening to the girls' concerns. Dangers included the infectious diseases of the time and workplace accidents. In 1889, one of the sisters of Abbotsford lost her hand in an accident involving laundry machinery. Conditions of manual work were harsh everywhere. The state-run Parramatta Girls Home, which also had a laundry, had similar harsh conditions but a worse record for sexual assaults. The asylums were initially established as refuges, with the residents free to leave. In the early 1900s, they reluctantly began to accept court referrals. \\"They took in girls whom no-one else wanted and who were forcibly confined, contrary to the wishes of both the girls and the nuns.\\" A 1954 report of the Sun Herald of a visit to the Ashfield laundry found 55 girls there involuntarily, 124 voluntary inmates, including 65 mentally challenged adult women, and about 30 who were originally there involuntarily but had stayed on. The dormitories were described as seriously overcrowded.

Other names for the practice include janitor's insurance and dead peasants insurance. When the employer is a bank, the insurance is known as a bank owned life insurance (BOLI). COLI was originally purchased on the lives of key employees and executives by a company to hedge against the financial cost of losing key employees to unexpected death, the risk of recruiting and training replacements of necessary or highly trained personnel, or to fund corporate obligations to redeem stock upon the death of an owner. This use is commonly known as \\"key man\\" or \\"key person\\" insurance. Although this article refers only to practice and policy in the United States, key person insurance is used in other countries as well. Primarily in the 1990s, some companies aggressively insured a broad base of employees, as part of general hiring requirements, and never without the employee's written consent. During the hiring process, employees sign many documents, including life, health and welfare coverage agreements or applications for insurance. Additionally, up until 1984, certain premiums for life insurance were leveraged and deducted, in essence creating a transaction with highest possible tax benefits. Even today, when a COLI plan's death benefits are paid to an employees family directly, the company paying the premiums can deduct them from corporate profits and earnings legally. In 2006, the U.S. Congress and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) set some guidelines and limits on the installation and administration of COLI and BOLI. Today, COLI is most common for senior executives of a firm, but its use for general employees is still sometimes practiced, primarily as a real economic transaction for Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Associations (VEBAs). Tax law history Under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) dealing with life insurance benefits paid due to the death of the insured, the benefits are usually excluded from the taxable income of the beneficiary. Because of the tax-free nature of death benefits, the IRC prohibits the deduction of the premiums paid for life insurance when the premium payor is also the beneficiary of the death benefit rather than the individual employee and their family. In addition, loans from insurers secured by policy values are not income and earnings credited to an owner's policy values (known as \\"inside buildup\\") by the insurance company are not currently taxed (and may escape taxation altogether if such earnings are not distributed other than as part of the death benefits paid upon the death of the insured). =1950s: Leveraged insurance= Interest incurred on indebtedness has historically been deductible, (although the deduction of \\"personal\\" interest was largely eliminated in 1986), and in the 1950s a type of \\"leveraged insurance\\" transaction began being marketed that permitted an insurance owner to in effect deduct the cost of paying for insurance by (1) paying large premiums to create cash values, (2) \\"borrowing\\" against the cash value to in effect strip out the large premiums, and (3) paying deductible \\"interest\\" back to the insurer, which was in turn credited to the policy's cash value as tax-deferred earnings on the policy that could fund the insurer's legitimate charges against policy value for cost of insurance, etc. The advantage of being able to deduct interest, on the one hand, and yet not include in income the interest credited to the policy's cash value is a form of \\"tax arbitrage.\\" The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), via the Supreme Court case Knetsch v. United States (1960), had early success in challenging the bona fides of these types of arrangements as creating legitimate debt and interest eligible to be deducted. However, subsequent court losses and IRC amendments weakened their position, appearing to permit tax-deductible borrowing to provide funds to pay insurance premiums, so long as such borrowing did not account for more than three of the first seven annual premiums on the policy (the \\"4 out of 7\\" test). =1980s: Tax shelters= Another IRC amendment limited to $50,000 the amount that could be borrowed (and yet yield deductible interest payments) with respect to any one insured. Although the 4 out of 7 test was exploited in the 1980s by businesses seeking to in effect pay for insurance on employees/shareholders, e.g., on a deductible basis, the introduction of the US$50,000 cap/insured in 1986 in turn led to the creation of broad-based leveraged COLI transactions, i.e., those in which the employer would purchase life insurance on hundreds or thousands of (usually low-level) employees, that would produce tax savings on interest deductions in excess of the actual cost to the employer of engaging in the transaction. These transactions were deemed by the IRS to be \\"tax shelters.\\" In a typical broad-based leveraged COLI transaction, a corporate employer would purchase policies on masses of lower-level employees, sometimes without the employees' knowledge or consent. When an insured employee died, the company received the death benefits, and the employee's family typically received either a small portion of the proceeds or nothing. These policies could remain in place even after the employee quits or retires. =1990s to present: Limited reform= Ultimately, the IRS won court cases against several leveraged COLI investors, including Camelot Music, Winn-Dixie, American Electric Power, and Dow Chemical. Other similar investors settled their tax cases with the IRS on a basis mostly favorable to the IRS. Meanwhile, Congress amended the IRC several times again to both ensure that the prohibition on borrowing (on a deductible basis) to fund insurance acquisitions was clear and to deny the tax-free nature of death benefits to corporate employer in some situations (e.g., if the insured was not provided with adequate advance notice and an opportunity to block the insurance acquisition or if the insured was not an employee of the corporation within a year of his or her death). So long as the employer complies with the new rules (adopted in 2006 and characterized as the \\"COLI Best Practices Act\\"), however, the tax-free nature of the death benefits and the tax deferral on earnings credited to policy value remain. The COLI Best Practices Provision, within the Pension Protection Act of 2006, was signed into law on August 17, 2006. This provision is designed to codify industry \\"best practices\\" regarding employer-owned life insurance and amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by introducing conditions that must be met in order to exclude from gross income the proceeds from company-owned life insurance. The Act amends Section 101 of the Internal Revenue Code by adding subsection (j), ‚Äútreatment of Certain Employer-Owned Life insurance Contracts,‚Äù and adds Section 60391, ‚ÄúReturns and Records with respect to Employer-Owned Life Insurance Contracts.‚Äù Under Section 101(j), the employer- owned death benefit proceeds will be considered eligible for exclusion from the employer's income provided all the following Notice and Consent Requirements and one of the Specified Exceptions are met. Notice and Consent Requirements : The Employee must, prior to the issuance of the insurance contract: # Be notified in writing that the employer intends to insure the employee‚Äôs life and the maximum face amount for which the employee could be insured at the time the contract is issued. # Provide written consent to be insured under the contract during and after active employment. # Be informed in writing if the employer will be a sole or partial beneficiary of any death benefits. : Specified Exception: : The insured was an employee at any time during the 12-month period before the insured‚Äôs death. : Specified Exception: : Directors and Highly Compensated Employees: At time of contract issue, the insured employee was a director, or a 5% or greater owner of the business at any time during the preceding year, or received compensation in excess of $95,000, adjusted for future inflation, in the preceding year, or was one of the five highest-paid officers, or was among the highest-paid 35% of all employees. According to one source, Hartford Life Insurance estimated that one-quarter of all Fortune 500 companies have COLI policies, which cover the lives of about 5 million employees. See also *H. H.

They were held in Arnhem, Netherlands, from 21 to 30 June 1980. Background Noggi and Joggi, the official mascots of the 1980 Summer Paralympics The Soviet Union, hosts of the 1980 Summer Olympics, were invited to host these Paralympics. However, disability sport was not there, and they passed; notoriously, a statement was issued denying the existence of any disabled people in the country.http://dsq- sds.org/article/view/936/1111 Soviet Paralympic teams were first represented in the 1988 Summer and Winter Games, also the last while the Soviet Union was extant. The first Paralympics on former Soviet territory would be in 2014. There was controversy during the preparation for these Games over the inclusion of a team from South Africa. In the Netherlands, public and official opinion was against the inclusion of the South African team and pressure came from a number of sports organisations against the Organising Committee. The Dutch Parliament was negative as well. Eventually, the parliament decided against allowing the participation of the South African team. Although \\"much of the publicity relating to the South African participation had been negative, it did succeed in bringing the disabled sports movement into the minds of many people who would not have otherwise considered the subject at all. Dutch organisers also increased visibility through their fundraising ... building a fund that would hold a surplus years after the games. This would naturally find its expression in the International Fund Sport Disabled, supporting the future of the paralympic movement in the 1980s.\\"  Sports  Competitors were divided into four disability categories: amputee, cerebral palsy, visually impaired, and wheelchair. It was the first time that cerebral palsy athletes competed in the Paralympics.

Prior to the Games, the States General (national Parliament) of the Netherlands, as host country, adopted a motion declaring South Africa's participation \\"undesirable\\", due to its policy of apartheid. The 1980 Games thus marked South Africa's first absence from the Summer Paralympics since it had joined the movement in 1964, and it remained absent until 1992. The United States and other countries boycotted the Olympics because of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War but they did not boycott the Paralympics.

Frank Norris. It is headquartered in Springfield, Missouri. In North America there are 4,500 congregations totaling 1.2 million members associated with it; an additional 10,000 churches are associated worldwide.National Council of Churches' Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches Founding and history In 1948, George Beauchamp Vick (Norris' co-pastor in Detroit, Michigan) became president of the World Baptist Fellowship owned Bible Baptist Seminary of Fort Worth, Texas (later Arlington Baptist College). In May 1950, Norris had Vick removed from the school presidency. After Vick officially resigned from the WBF, he and Noel Smith, W. E. Dowell Sr., R. O. Woodworth, Fred Donnelson, and other pastors met in the Texas Hotel and laid groundwork for a new fellowship.Baptist Bible Tribune, Volume 1, No 1, page 8; www.bbcnet.edu/library/ The organizational meeting for what would become BBFI was held in 1950 at the Central Baptist Church in Denton, Texas. Approximately 100 pastors and missionaries were among the founders of the new Baptist group. They chose Springfield, Missouri as their headquarters and started the Baptist Bible College, the Baptist Bible Tribune, and a Missions Office to serve as a clearinghouse for missionary support. In the years that have passed since those early days, it has grown into the largest independent Baptist Missionary organization in the world. Functions and structure There are three functions of the Baptist Bible Fellowship International. Worldwide missions, training, and communication. A Missions Office at the Springfield, Missouri headquarters serves as a support base for the over nine hundred missionaries of the BBFI. Their primary task is to serve as a clearinghouse for missions support sent by thousands of BBFI-affiliated churches and distributed to the missionaries' accounts. Over $385 million was sent through the BBFI Missions Office between 2000 and 2009. The Missions Office is supported separately by the churches on a voluntary basis so that all the donations are dispersed to the field. Through the efforts of BBFI missionaries, well over 6,000 churches have been established, along with numerous schools, camps, orphanages, and feeding centers. The current Missions Director is Jon Konnerup. Training takes place through the Fellowship's two owned schools and other approved, but separately owned and operated schools. Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Missouri, has been the flagship school since its founding in 1950, growing to become the world's largest Bible college at its apex in the mid-1970s. It is accredited by the North Central Association, and the current president is Mark Milioni. A second school was founded in 1976 in Shrub Oak, New York, later moving to Boston to become Boston Baptist College. It is accredited by Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools, and the current president is David Melton. Two other schools are approved by the BBFI as recognized training centers for its missionaries, Pacific Baptist College in Pomona, California; and Louisiana Baptist University in Shreveport, Louisiana. These schools are owned and operated by others, but are sanctioned to be eligible to receive funds through the BBFI Missions Office. The Baptist Bible Tribune, published monthly, contains numerous opinion pieces, reports from the foreign mission field, reports from domestic churches, and light theological treatises. It is written by BBFI officers, pastors and missionaries and is the official voice of the BBFI. The current editor is Randy Harp who was preceded by Keith Bassham.http://www.tribune.org/randy-harp-new-leader-of-tribune-and- bbfi-communications/ The current national structure of the BBFI consists of pastors rather than congregations. Affiliation is open to any Baptist pastor of a supporting Baptist church believing in and adhering to twenty articles of faith, outlined in a small booklet available from the Mission Office. Official recognition of that affiliation is contingent upon financial support of at least one of the three established functions described above. The organizational structure includes president, vice-presidents, secretary, treasurer, and one director from each state elected by his own state fellowship. Within this organization, there are state fellowships in each of the fifty United States. One example of a state fellowship is the Texas Baptist Bible Fellowship. With nearly 500 affiliated churches, the Texas BBF is active in planting new churches and helping raise financial support for new missionaries. Current chairman of the Texas BBF is Pastor Mike Marcellus at First Church, Austin, Texas. Some BBFI churches and pastors also affiliate with and support other fellowships, such as the World Baptist Fellowship. The BBFI is also one of three Fellowships---along with the World Baptist Fellowship and the Southwide Baptist Fellowship which make up the International Baptist Network. Although the current number of members is not public knowledge, most experts believe that membership in the BBFI has declined in the past 10 years. The Fellowship owns the original Baptist Bible College, as well as Boston Baptist College. Some affiliated churches drop the word \\"International\\" from their name, but this shouldn't be confused as a separate group. Association with Jerry Falwell Jerry Falwell was affiliated with the Baptist Bible Fellowship International since his graduation from Baptist Bible College in Springfield Missouri in 1956, and later also affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention.https://www.wayoflife.org/pdf/20170224.pdf While Falwell's Moral Majority was intended to be an inter-faith coalition, more than half its State Chairman were members of the Baptist Bible Fellowship International.

The British Statute of Anne 1710, full title \\"An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned\\", was the first copyright statute. Initially copyright law only applied to the copying of books. Over time other uses such as translations and derivative works were made subject to copyright and copyright now covers a wide range of works, including maps, performances, paintings, photographs, sound recordings, motion pictures and computer programs. Today national copyright laws have been standardised to some extent through international and regional agreements such as the Berne Convention and the European copyright directives. Although there are consistencies among nations' copyright laws, each jurisdiction has separate and distinct laws and regulations about copyright. Some jurisdictions also recognize moral rights of creators, such as the right to be credited for the work. Copyrights are exclusive rights granted to the author or creator of an original work, including the right to copy, distribute and adapt the work. Copyright does not protect ideas, only their expression or fixation. In most jurisdictions copyright arises upon fixation and does not need to be registered. Copyright owners have the exclusive statutory right to exercise control over copying and other exploitation of the works for a specific period of time, after which the work is said to enter the public domain. Uses which are covered under limitations and exceptions to copyright, such as fair use, do not require permission from the copyright owner. All other uses require permission and copyright owners can license or permanently transfer or assign their exclusive rights to others. Early developments European output of books before the advent of copyright, 500s to 1700s. Blue shows printed books. Log-lin plot; a straight line therefore shows an exponential increase. The earliest recorded historical case-law on the right to copy comes from ancient Ireland. The Cathach is the oldest extant Irish manuscript of the Psalter and the earliest example of Irish writing. It contains a Vulgate version of Psalms XXX (30) to CV (105) with an interpretative rubric or heading before each psalm. It is traditionally ascribed to Saint Columba as the copy, made at night in haste by a miraculous light, of a Psalter lent to Columba by St. Finnian. In the 6th century, a dispute arose about the ownership of the copy and King Diarmait Mac Cerbhaill gave the judgement \\"To every cow belongs her calf, therefore to every book belongs its copy.\\" The Battle of C√∫l Dreimhne was fought over this issue. Modern copyright law has been influenced by an array of older legal rights that have been recognized throughout history, including the moral rights of the author who created a work, the economic rights of a benefactor who paid to have a copy made, the property rights of the individual owner of a copy, and a sovereign's right to censor and to regulate the printing industry. The origins of some of these rights can be traced back to ancient Greek culture, ancient Jewish law, and ancient Roman law. In Greek society, during the sixth century B.C.E., there emerged the notion of the individual self, including personal ideals, ambition, and creativity. The individual self is important in copyright because it distinguishes the creativity produced by an individual from the rest of society. In ancient Jewish Talmudic law there can be found recognition of the moral rights of the author and the economic or property rights of an author. Prior to the invention of movable type in the West in the mid-15th century, texts were copied by hand and the small number of texts generated few occasions for these rights to be tested. During the Roman Empire, a period of prosperous book trade, no copyright or similar regulations existed,Martial, The Epigrams, Penguin, 1978, James Mitchie copying by those other than professional booksellers was rare. This is because books were, typically, copied by literate slaves, who were expensive to buy and maintain. Thus, any copier would have had to pay much the same expense as a professional publisher. Roman book sellers would sometimes pay a well-regarded author for first access to a text for copying, but they had no exclusive rights to a work and authors were not normally paid anything for their work. Martial, in his Epigrams, complains about receiving no profit despite the popularity of his poetry throughout the Roman Empire. The printing press came into use in Europe in the 1400s and 1500s, and made it much cheaper to produce books. As there was initially no copyright law, anyone could buy or rent a press and print any text. Popular new works were immediately re-set and re-published by competitors, so printers needed a constant stream of new material. Fees paid to authors for new works were high, and significantly supplemented the incomes of many academics. Printing brought profound social changes. The rise in literacy across Europe led to a dramatic increase in the demand for reading matter.Copyright in Historical Perspective, p. 136-137, Patterson, 1968, Vanderbilt Univ. Press Prices of reprints were low, so publications could be bought by poorer people, creating a mass-market readership. In German-speaking areas, most publications were academic papers, and most were scientific and technical publications, often autodidactic practical instruction manuals on topics such as dike construction. After copyright law became established (in 1710 in England, and in the 1840s in German-speaking areas) the low-price mass market vanished, and fewer, more expensive editions were published. Heinrich Heine, in a 1854 letter to his publisher, complains: \\"Due to the tremendously high prices you have established, I will hardly see a second edition of the book anytime soon. But you must set lower prices, dear Campe, for otherwise I really don't see why I was so lenient with my material interests.\\" Early privileges and monopolies Title page of Index Librorum Prohibitorum, or List of Prohibited Books, (Venice 1564). The origin of copyright law in most European countries lies in efforts by the church and governments to regulate and control the output of printers. Before the invention of the printing press, a writing, once created, could only be physically multiplied by the highly laborious and error-prone process of manual copying by scribes. An elaborate system of censorship and control over scribes did not exist, as scribes were scattered and worked on single manuscripts. Printing allowed for multiple exact copies of a work, leading to a more rapid and widespread circulation of ideas and information (see print culture). In 1559 the Index Expurgatorius, or List of Prohibited Books, was issued for the first time. In Europe printing was invented and widely established in the 15th and 16th centuries. While governments and church encouraged printing in many ways, which allowed the dissemination of Bibles and government information, works of dissent and criticism could also circulate rapidly. As a consequence, governments established controls over printers across Europe, requiring them to have official licences to trade and produce books. The licenses typically gave printers the exclusive right to print particular works for a fixed period of years, and enabled the printer to prevent others from printing the same work during that period. The licenses could only grant rights to print in the territory of the state that had granted them, but they did usually prohibit the import of foreign printing. The republic of Venice granted its first privilege for a particular book in 1486. It was a special case, being the history of the city itself, the 'Rerum venetarum ab urbe condita opus' of Marcus Antonius Coccius Sabellicus\\".Armstrong, Elizabeth. Before Copyright: the French book-privilege system 1498‚Äì1526. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 1990, p. 3 From 1492 onwards Venice began regularly granting privileges for books.Armstrong, Elizabeth. Before Copyright: the French book- privilege system 1498‚Äì1526. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 1990, p. 6 The Republic of Venice, the dukes of Florence, and Leo X and other Popes conceded at different times to certain printers the exclusive privilege of printing for specific terms (rarely exceeding 14 years) editions of classic authors. The first copyright privilege in England bears date 1518 and was issued to Richard Pynson, King's Printer, the successor to William Caxton. The privilege gives a monopoly for the term of two years. The date is 15 years later than that of the first privilege issued in France. Early copyright privileges were called \\"monopolies,\\" particularly during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, who frequently gave grants of monopolies in articles of common use, such as salt, leather, coal, soap, cards, beer, and wine. The practice was continued until the Statute of Monopolies was enacted in 1623, ending most monopolies, with certain exceptions, such as patents; after 1623, grants of Letters patent to publishers became common.Deazley, Ronan. Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language. (Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2006), p. 24. The earliest German privilege of which there is trustworthy record was issued in 1501 by the Aulic Council to an association entitled the Sodalitas Rhenana Celtica, for the publication of an edition of the dramas of Hroswitha of Gandersheim, which had been prepared for the press by Conrad Celtes .Kawohl, F. (2008) \\"Commentary on Imperial privileges for Conrad Celtis (1501/02) in: Primary Sources on Copyright (1450‚Äì1900), eds L. Bently & M. Kretschmer, www.copyrighthistory.org According to historian Eckhard H√∂ffner indicated that there was no effective copyright legislation in Germany in the early 19th century. Prussia introduced a copyright law in 1837, but even then authors and publishers just had to go to another German state to circumvent its ruling. First page of John Milton's 1644 edition of Areopagitica, in it he argued forcefully against the Licensing Order of 1643. As the \\"menace\\" of printing spread, governments established centralized control mechanisms, and in 1557 the English Crown thought to stem the flow of seditious and heretical books by chartering the Stationers' Company. The right to print was limited to the members of that guild, and thirty years later the Star Chamber was chartered to curtail the \\"greate enormities and abuses\\" of \\"dyvers contentyous and disorderlye persons professinge the arte or mystere of pryntinge or selling of books.\\" The right to print was restricted to two universities and to the 21 existing printers in the city of London, which had 53 printing presses. The French crown also repressed printing, and printer Etienne Dolet was burned at the stake in 1546. As the English took control of type founding in 1637, printers fled to the Netherlands. Confrontation with authority made printers radical and rebellious, and 800 authors, printers and book dealers were incarcerated in the Bastille before it was stormed in 1789. The notion that the expression of dissent or subversive views should be tolerated, not censured or punished by law, developed alongside the rise of printing and the press. The Areopagitica, published in 1644 under the full title Areopagitica: A speech of Mr. John Milton for the liberty of unlicensed printing to the Parliament of England, was John Milton's response to the English parliament re-introducing government licensing of printers, hence publishers. In doing so Milton articulated the main strands of future discussions about freedom of expression. By defining the scope of freedom of expression and of \\"harmful\\" speech Milton argued against the principle of pre- censorship and in favour of tolerance for a wide range of views. Early British copyright law The Statute of Anne came into force in 1710 In England the printers, known as stationers, formed a collective organisation, known as the Stationers' Company. In the 16th century the Stationers' Company was given the power to require all lawfully printed books to be entered into its register. Only members of the Stationers' Company could enter books into the register. This meant that the Stationers' Company achieved a dominant position over publishing in 17th-century England (no equivalent arrangement formed in Scotland and Ireland). The monopoly came to an end in 1695, when the English Parliament did not renew the Stationers' Company's power. In 1707 the parliaments of England and Scotland were united as a result of the Anglo- Scottish Union. The new parliament was able to change the laws in both countries and an important early piece of legislation was the Copyright Act of 1710, also known as the Statute of Anne, after Queen Anne. The act came into force in 1710 and was the first copyright statute. Its full title was \\"An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned\\". The enforcement of the Statute of Anne in April 1710 marked a historic moment in the development of copyright law. As the world's first copyright statute it granted publishers of a book legal protection of 14 years with the commencement of the statute. It also granted 21 years of protection for any book already in print. The Statute of Anne had a much broader social focus and remit than the monopoly granted to the Stationers' Company. The statute was concerned with the reading public, the continued production of useful literature, and the advancement and spread of education. The central plank of the statute is a social quid pro quo; to encourage \\"learned men to compose and write useful books\\" the statute guaranteed the finite right to print and reprint those works. It established a pragmatic bargain involving authors, the booksellers and the public. The Statute of Anne ended the old system whereby only literature that met the censorship standards administered by the booksellers could appear in print. The statute furthermore created a public domain for literature, as previously all literature belonged to the booksellers forever. According to Patterson and Lindberg, the Statute of Anne: > \\"... transformed the stationers' copyright - which had been used as a device > of monopoly and an instrument of censorship - into a trade-regulation > concept to promote learning and to curtail the monopoly of publishers ... > The features of the Statute of Anne that justify the epithet of trade > regulation included the limited term of copyright, the availability of > copyright to anyone, and the price-control provisions. Copyright, rather > than being perpetual, was now limited to a term of fourteen years, with a > like renewal term being available only to the author (and only if the author > were living at the end of the first term).\\" When the statutory copyright term provided for by the Statute of Anne began to expire in 1731 London booksellers thought to defend their dominant position by seeking injunctions from the Court of Chancery for works by authors that fell outside the statute's protection. At the same time the London booksellers lobbied parliament to extend the copyright term provided by the Statute of Anne. Eventually, in a case known as Midwinter v Hamilton (1743‚Äì1748), the London booksellers turned to common law and started a 30-year period known as the battle of the booksellers. The battle of the booksellers saw London booksellers locking horns with the newly emerging Scottish book trade over the right to reprint works falling outside the protection of the Statute of Anne. The Scottish booksellers argued that no common law copyright existed in an author's work. The London booksellers argued that the Statute of Anne only supplemented and supported a pre-existing common law copyright. The dispute was argued out in a number of notable cases, including Millar v Kincaid (1749‚Äì1751) and Tonson v Collins (1761‚Äì1762). =Common law copyright= A debate raged on whether printed ideas could be owned and London booksellers and other supporters of perpetual copyright argued that without it scholarship would cease to exist and that authors would have no incentive to continue creating works of enduring value if they could not bequeath the property rights to their descendants. Opponents of perpetual copyright argued that it amounted to a monopoly, which inflated the price of books, making them less affordable and therefore prevented the spread of the Enlightenment. London booksellers were attacked for using rights of authors to mask their greed and self-interest in controlling the book trade. When Donaldson v Beckett reached the House of Lords in 1774, Lord Camden was most strident in his rejection of common law copyright, warning the Lords that, should they vote in favour of common law copyright, effectively a perpetual copyright, \\"all our learning will be locked up in the hands of the Tonsons and the Lintots of the age\\". Moreover, he warned, booksellers would then set upon books whatever price they pleased \\"till the public became as much their slaves, as their own hackney compilers are\\". He declared that \\"Knowledge and science are not things to be bound in such cobweb chains.\\" In its ruling the House of Lords established that the rights and responsibilities in copyright were determined by legislation. There is however still disagreement over whether the House of Lords affirmed the existence of common law copyright before it was superseded by the Statute of Anne. The Lords had traditionally been hostile to the booksellers' monopoly and were aware of how the doctrine of common law copyright, promoted by the booksellers, was used to support their case for a perpetual copyright. The Lords clearly decided against perpetual copyright and, by confirming that the copyright term (the length of time that a work is in copyright) did expire according to statute, the Lords also affirmed the public domain. The ruling in Donaldson v Beckett confirmed that a large number of works and books first published in Britain were in the public domain, either because the copyright term granted by statute had expired or because they were first published before the Statute of Anne was enacted in 1710. This opened the market for cheap reprints of works by Shakespeare, Milton and Chaucer, works now considered classics. The expansion of the public domain in books broke the dominance of the London booksellers and allowed for competition, with the number of London booksellers and publishers rising nearly threefold, from 111 to 308, between 1772 and 1802. Eventually an understanding was established whereby authors had a pre-existing common law copyright over their work, but that with the Statute of Anne parliament had limited these rights in order to strike a more appropriate balance between the interests of the author and the wider social good. According to Patterson and Livingston, confusion about the nature of copyright has remained ever since. Copyright has come to be viewed both as a natural-law right of the author and as the statutory grant of a limited monopoly. One theory holds that copyright is created simply by the creation of a work, the other that it is owed to a copyright statute. In August 1906 The Copyright Law for Music Act 1906, known as the T.P. O'Connor Bill was added to copyright law when it was passed by the British Parliament, following many of the popular music writers at the time dying in poverty due to extensive piracy by gangs during the piracy crisis of sheet music in the early 20th century.Atkinson, Benedict. & Fitzgerald, Brian.

Early French copyright law 1652 example In pre-revolutionary France all books needed to be approved by official censors and authors and publishers had to obtain a royal privilege before a book could be published. Royal privileges were exclusive and usually granted for six years, with the possibility of renewal. Over time it was established that the owner of a royal privilege has the sole right to obtain a renewal indefinitely. In 1761 the Royal Council awarded a royal privilege to the heirs of an author rather than the author's publisher, sparking a national debate on the nature of literary property similar to that taking place in Britain during the battle of the booksellers. In 1777 a series of royal decrees reformed the royal privileges. The duration of privileges were set at a minimum duration of 10 years or the life of the author, which ever was longer. If the author obtained a privilege and did not transfer or sell it on, he could publish and sell copies of the book himself, and pass the privilege on to his heirs, who enjoyed an exclusive right into perpetuity. If the privilege was sold to a publisher, the exclusive right would only last the specified duration. The royal decrees prohibited the renewal of privileges and once the privilege had expired anyone could obtain a \\"permission simple\\" to print or sell copies of the work. Hence the public domain in books whose privilege had expired was expressly recognised. After the French Revolution a dispute over Com√©die-Fran√ßaise being granted the exclusive right to the public performance of all dramatic works erupted and in 1791 the National Assembly abolished the privilege. Anyone was allowed to establish a public theatre and the National Assembly declared that the works of any author who had died more than five years ago were public property. In the same degree the National Assembly granted authors the exclusive right to authorise the public performance of their works during their lifetime, and extended that right to the authors' heirs and assignees for five years after the author's death. The National Assembly took the view that a published work was by its nature a public property, and that an author's rights are recognised as an exception to this principle, to compensate an author for his work. In 1793 a new law was passed giving authors, composers, and artists the exclusive right to sell and distribute their works, and the right was extended to their heirs and assigns for 10 years after the author's death. The National Assembly placed this law firmly on a natural right footing, calling the law the \\"Declaration of the Rights of Genius\\" and so evoking the famous Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. However, author's rights were subject to the condition of making depositing copies of the work with the Biblioth√®que Nationale and 19th- century commentators characterised the 1793 law as utilitarian and \\"a charitable grant from society\\". Early United States copyright law The Copyright Act of 1790 in the Columbian Centinel Expansion of U.S. copyright law (Assuming authors create their works at age 35 and live for seventy years) The Statute of Anne did not apply to the American colonies. The economy of early America was largely agrarian and only three private copyright acts had been passed in America prior to 1783. Two of the acts were limited to seven years, the other was limited to a term of five years. In 1783 several authors' petitions persuaded the Continental Congress \\"that nothing is more properly a man's own than the fruit of his study, and that the protection and security of literary property would greatly tend to encourage genius and to promote useful discoveries.\\" But under the Articles of Confederation, the Continental Congress had no authority to enact copyright law. The Continental Congress passed a resolution urging the States to \\"secure to the authors or publishers of any new book not hitherto printed ... the copy right of such books for a certain time not less than fourteen years from the first publication; and to secure to the said authors, if they shall survive the term first mentioned, ... the copy right of such books for another term of time no less than fourteen years. Three states had already enacted copyright statutes in 1783 prior to the Continental Congress resolution, and in the subsequent three years all of the remaining states except Delaware passed a copyright statute. Seven of the States followed the Statute of Anne and the Continental Congress' resolution by providing two fourteen-year terms. The five remaining States granted copyright for single terms of fourteen, twenty and twenty one years, with no right of renewal. At the Philadelphia Convention in 1787, both James Madison of Virginia and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina submitted proposals that would allow Congress the power to grant copyright for a limited time. These proposals are the origin of the Copyright Clause in the United States Constitution, which allows the granting of copyright and patents for a limited time to serve a utilitarian function, namely \\"to promote the progress of science and useful arts\\". The first federal copyright act was the Copyright Act of 1790. It granted copyright for a term of 14 years \\"from the time of recording the title thereof\\" with a right of renewal for another 14 years if the author survived to the end of the first term. The act covered not only books, but also maps and charts. With exception of the provision on maps and charts the Copyright Act of 1790 is copied almost verbatim from the Statute of Anne. At the time works only received protection under federal statutory copyright if the statutory formalities, such as a proper copyright notice, were satisfied. If this was not the case the work immediately entered into the public domain. In 1834 the Supreme Court ruled in Wheaton v. Peters (a case similar to the 1774 case of Donaldson v Beckett in Britain) that although the author of an unpublished work had a common law right to control the first publication of that work, the author did not have a common law right to control reproduction following the first publication of the work. Early internationalisation Berne Convention signatory countries (in blue). The Berne Convention was first established in 1886, and was subsequently re- negotiated in 1896 (Paris), 1908 (Berlin), 1928 (Rome), 1948 (Brussels), 1967 (Stockholm) and 1971 (Paris). The convention relates to literary and artistic works, which includes films, and the convention requires its member states to provide protection for every production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain. The Berne Convention has a number of core features, including the principle of national treatment, which holds that each member state to the convention would give citizens of other member states the same rights of copyright that it gave to its own citizens (Article 3-5). Another core feature is the establishment of minimum standards of national copyright legislation in that each member state agrees to certain basic rules which their national laws must contain. Though member states can if they wish increase the amount of protection given to copyright owners. One important minimum rule was that the term of copyright was to be a minimum of the author's lifetime plus 50 years. Another important minimum rule established by the Berne Convention is that copyright arises with the creation of a work and does not depend upon any formality such as a system of public registration (Article 5(2)). At the time some countries did require registration of copyright, and when Britain implemented the Berne Convention in the Copyright Act 1911 it had to abolish its system of registration at Stationers' Hall. The Berne Convention focuses on authors as the key figure in copyright law and the stated purpose of the convention is \\"the protection of the rights of authors in their literary and artistic works\\" (Article 1), rather than the protection of publishers and other actors in the process of disseminating works to the public. In the 1928 revision the concept of moral rights was introduced (Article 6bis), giving authors the right to be identified as a such and to object to derogatory treatment of their works. These rights, unlike economic rights such as preventing reproduction, could not be transferred to others. The Berne Convention also enshrined limitations and exceptions to copyright, enabling the reproduction of literary and artistic works without the copyright owners prior permission. The detail of these exceptions was left to national copyright legislation, but the guiding principle is stated in Article 9 of the convention. The so-called three-step test holds that an exception is only permitted \\"in certain special cases, provided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author\\". Free use of copyrighted work is expressly permitted in the case of quotations from lawfully published works, illustration for teaching purposes, and news reporting (Article 10). Copyright in communist countries Copyright and technology * Digital technology introduces a new level of controversy into copyright policy. * Inclusion of software as copyright subject matter on the recommendation of CONTU and then later with the EU Computer Programs Directive. * Enactment of Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). * Controversy over the copyrightability of databases (Feist Publications v.

Commentators such as Barlow (1994) have argued that digital copyright is fundamentally different and will remain persistently difficult to enforce; others such as Stallman (1996) have argued that the Internet deeply undermines the economic rationale for copyright in the first place. These perspectives may lead to the consideration of alternative compensation systems in place of exclusive rights for all types of information, including software, books, movies, and music.

He was known for pioneering his structural improvisation method, Conduction, which he utilized on many recordings. Biography Morris was born in Long Beach, California. Before beginning his musical career, he served in the army as a medic in Germany, Japan and Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Morris came to attention with saxophonist David Murray's groups in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Morris's brother, double bassist Wilber Morris, sometimes performed and recorded with Murray during this period. Morris led a group called Orchestra SLANG. The group features Drummer Kenny Wollesen, alto saxophonist Jonathon Haffner, trumpeter Kirk Knuffke and others. He performed and presented regularly as part of the Festival of New Trumpet Music, held annually in New York City. Morris wrote most of the incidental music for the 1989 TV show A Man Called Hawk, which starred Avery Brooks, with whom he co-wrote the theme music, along with Stanley Clarke. He also played with well-known artist and would-be drummer A.R. Penck in 1990. For AudioBox Matera 1990: International Festival of Sound Experimentation (Pinotto Fava, curator), Morris created Spiriti Materani featuring Wayne Horvitz (keyboards, electronics), J. A. Deane (trombone, electronics), and Butch (cornet). The project took place in Madonna delle Virt√π, a 12th-century rupestrian church in Sasso Caveoso, Matera, Italy. Morris is the originator of Conduction (a term borrowed from physics), a type of structured free improvisation where Morris directs and conducts an improvising ensemble with a series of hand and baton gestures. These conductions have received generally positive reviews, and are often considered quite unique, not quite fitting into any one musical genre. Critic Thom Jurek has written, \\"There are no records like Butch Morris' conduction sides, nor could there be, though he wishes there were.\\"Jurek, Thom, \\"Berlin Skyscraper '95\\" review from AllMusic and Ed Hazell writes, \\"At his best, Morris can shake players out of their old habits, or place a microscope on one aspect of a musician's artistry and build an orchestral fantasia around it.\\"Hazell, Ed, \\"Out of the lab: Butch Morris's bold experiment yields 10 CDs\\" URL accessed February 15, 2007 Morris died of lung cancer on January 29, 2013 at the age of 65 in a hospital in New York City.

It is a soil-borne fungus of the species Phymatotrichopsis omnivora that attacks the roots of susceptible plants. It was first discovered in 1888 by Pammel, and was named by Duggar in 1916. A monograph of this disease, which includes a historical review, was written by R.B. Streets and H.E. Bloss in 1973.R.B. Streets and H.E. Bloss. 1973. Phymatotrichum Root Rot. Monograph #8. The American Phytopathological Society, St. Paul, MN  Host and symptoms  Phymatotrichopsis omnivora is a necrotic fungal pathogen that has a very broad host range, attacking almost 2000 dicotyledonus species. It is known to inhabit in the alkaline, calcareous soils in Southwest United States. It particularly targets dicots as most monocots are immune. Economically important plant host affected by the species include: peanuts, cotton, alfalfa, apple, pecans, and ornamental trees. First symptoms of disease is often chlorosis on the leaves. This is then followed by browning and wilting of the leaves. Eventually after two weeks of the first symptoms the plant dies. In the field, infected cotton plants exhibit wilting in the mid to late summer form large circular patches and later die. Upon closer examination, the host plant's vascular system will show extensive discoloration. Underneath the soil, more observable signs are present. Distinctive cuniform branched hyphae are found on infected root tissue which are observable with compound microscope (Figure 1). In addition, taproots of the infect plant will be covered in myclieal strands. Figure 1: Cruciform Hyphae is a unique sign observed using a compound microscopeAnother macro sign is during favorable high moisture environmental conditions where spore mats appear. Despite the name, the purpose of these spore mats are not known to aid in dispersal. Although presence of the condial phase on the spore mats is known the function of the produced condia remains unknown since condia germination is rarely observed The spore mats are tan and white, found on the soil surface near the infected plant.  Environment  Phymatotrichopsis omnivore thrives in humid warm weather conditions. The disease is most infectious in humid and warm conditions. Plant symptoms are most dramatic in warm conditions as plants become ever more dependent on their roots during these conditions. The pathogen, P. omnivore, also prefers alkane calcareous soils that rarely freeze over, hence why it is mainly restricted to southwest US.  Disease cycle  Figure 2: P. Omnivera disease cycle The disease overwinters as sclerotia or as mycelium on dead plant tissue. Once spring to early summer arrives, germination phase with hyphae growth continues. Following this, root colonization occurs. In Mid and late summer you begin to see the disease at its infectious stage, which is when you start to observe associated symptoms. The pathogen will penetrate the host, and colonize plant root tissue causing root rot. This initially causes the first symptoms of chlorotic leaves and eventually wilting. Root rot disease rings enlarge and the field can be categorized into three zones based upon plant status: asymptomatic, disease front and survivor. The pathogen will then eventually disseminate infecting neighboring plants, with infected plant tissue serving as a secondary inoculum fueling the disease. In situation of high moisture, conidia are produced on spore mats but its role in dispersal is currently unknown since very rarely conidia were found to germinate and facilitate the spread of disease. P. omnivore will form several differentiated hyphae. Initially, germ tubes emerge from soil residing sclerotia that overwinter. The sclerotia structure acts as the primary inoculum in affected fields. The pathogen hyphae will either infect the host root or form mycelium with a differentiated rind. Upon contact with host roots, P. omnivore forms a mycelial mantle on the root's surface. This leads to necrosis of epidermis and underlying cortical tissue, leading to root lesions. As the disease progresses, the roots are covered by the characteristic cinnamon-colored mycelial strands covered with acircular sterile hyphae, a diagnostic sign of Texas Root Rot. The roots at later stages of infection show extensive vascular discoloration due to root necroses. The mycelial strand and symptom development in field-infected roots are even more conspicuous on cotton. During the late summer and fall, mycelial strands formed on the root surfaces or in the soil form sclerotia to survive the winter, thus completing the life cycle.  Pathogenesis  As a soil borne pathogen, Phymatotrichopsis omnivore enters the plant host via the roots. It penetrates the host by growing infectious hyphae that cover the host plant root's epidermis and eventually infects epidermis and cortical cell junctions of plant host instead of having specialized penetration organs like an appressoria. From there the fungal pathogen infects root vascular system and begin cause cortical root lesions, which is most pronounced in cotton Microarray analysis and gene expression profiling revealed that certain pathways related to plant defense such as jasmonic acid, ethylene, and flavonoid production were reduced at later infectious stages. This suggests that in order to avoid plant defense Phymatotrichopsis omnivore suppresses the production of these phytochemical defenses to ensure success.  Control  There are currently no successful methods in controlling the severity and occurrence of the disease on a commercial scale ,. No fungicides and soil fumigation strategies have proved successful. Chemicals such as methyl bromide, anhydrous ammonia and ammonium salts were tested as effective but required deep injective into the soil, therefore expensive and not commercially feasible. In addition, systemic fungicides such as benzimidazoles and sterol biosynthesis inhibitors were shown to limit P. omnivore as well, but systemic fungicides are expensive, and exhibit poor soil penetration therefore pursued cautiously. Currently the best methods are limited to mainly cultural practices. The most effective strategy is identifying diseased plots and planting non-susceptible plants. Another strategy is host escape, by planting early maturing varieties for harvest before summer when the disease is most active6. Also by targeting the sclerotia, the survival structure, using deep plowing of a moldboard plow (6-8 inches deep). There are also some thoughts on biocontrol through microbial competition that may limit P. omnivore, the proposed genera Gliocladia and Trichoderma are thought to be antagonistic to P. omnivore, however these findings are not adequately tested and reported.  Importance  The pathogen is particularly economically important pathogen in cotton causing significant losses on average of $100 million annually (based on disease loss estimates and price data for 1980‚Äì2008; provided by the National Cotton Council of America, http://www.cotton.org). It is also a serious disease that can cause serious yield loss on many horticultural crops such as peanuts, apples, peaches, and ornamental trees.

Sydney: Art Gallery of New South Wales, 2007. , pp. 96‚Äì97 Ernest Lalor \\"Ern\\" Malley was a fictitious poet and the central figure in Australia's most famous literary hoax, known as the Ern Malley hoax or the Ern Malley affair. He and his entire body of work were created in one day in 1943 by conservative writers James McAuley and Harold Stewart in order to hoax members of the Angry Penguins, a modernist art and literary movement centered around a journal of the same name, co-edited by poet Max Harris and art patron John Reed, of Heide, Melbourne. Imitating the modernist poetry they despised, the hoaxers deliberately created what they thought was bad verse and mailed sixteen poems to Harris under the guise of Ethel, Ern Malley's surviving sister. Harris and other members of the Heide Circle fell for the hoax, and, enraptured by the poetry, devoted the next issue of Angry Penguins to Malley, hailing him as a genius. The hoax was revealed soon after, resulting in a cause c√©l√®bre and the humiliation of Harris, who was put on trial, convicted and fined for publishing the poems on the grounds that they contained obscene content. Angry Penguins folded in 1946. In the decades that followed, the hoax proved to be a significant setback for modernist poetry in Australia. Since the 1970s, however, the Ern Malley poems, though known to be a hoax, became celebrated as a successful example of surrealist poetry in their own right, lauded by poets and critics such as John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch and Robert Hughes. The poems of Ern Malley are now more widely read than those of his creators, and the affair has inspired works by major Australian writers and artists, such as Peter Carey and Sidney Nolan. American poet and anthologist David Lehman called Ern Malley \\"the greatest literary hoax of the twentieth century\\".  Background  James McAuley and Harold Stewart were both, in 1944, in the Army Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs. Before the war they had been part of Sydney's Bohemian arts world. McAuley had acted and sung in left-wing revues at Sydney University. Both preferred early Modernism to its later forms. McAuley, for example, claimed that T. S. Eliot's The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock (1917) was genius, but that the subsequent The Waste Land (1922), regarded by many as Eliot's finest achievement, was an incoherent mess. Both men lamented \\"the loss of meaning and craftsmanship\\" in poetry. They particularly despised the well-funded modernist poetry magazine Angry Penguins and were resentful of the precocious success of Max Harris, the magazine's founder and editor. Harris was a 22-year-old avant-garde poet and critic in Adelaide, who in 1940, at the age of 18, had started Angry Penguins.  Creating the hoax  McAuley and Stewart decided to perpetrate a hoax on Harris and Angry Penguins by submitting to the magazine nonsensical poetry, which they felt captured the worst of modernist tendencies, under the guise of a fictional poet. They came up with a fictional biography for the poet \\"Ernest Lalor Malley\\", who, they claimed, had died the year before at the age of 25. The name is a \\"highly Australian-sounding handle\\": \\"Malley\\" is a pun on the word mallee, denoting a class of Australian vegetation and a bird, the native malleefowl, and \\"Lalor\\" recalls Peter Lalor, leader of the 1854 Eureka Rebellion. Then, in one afternoon, they wrote his entire body of work: 17 poems, none longer than a page, and all intended to be read in sequence under the title The Darkening Ecliptic. Their writing style, as they described it, was to write down the first thing that came into their heads, lifting words and phrases from the Concise Oxford Dictionary, a Collected Shakespeare, and a Dictionary of Quotations: \\"We opened books at random, choosing a word or phrase haphazardly. We made lists of these and wove them in nonsensical sentences. We misquoted and made false allusions. We deliberately perpetrated bad verse, and selected awkward rhymes from a Ripman's Rhyming Dictionary.\\" They also included many bits of their own poetry, though in a deliberately disjointed manner. The first poem in the sequence, Durer: Innsbruck, 1495, was an unpublished serious effort by McAuley, edited to appeal to Harris: > I had often cowled in the slumbrous heavy air, Closed my inanimate lids to > find it real, As I knew it would be, the colourful spires And painted roofs, > the high snows glimpsed at the back, All reversed in the quiet reflecting > waters ‚Äì Not knowing then that Durer perceived it too. Now I find that once > more I have shrunk To an interloper, robber of dead men's dream, I had read > in books that art is not easy But no one warned that the mind repeats In its > ignorance the vision of others. I am still The black swan of trespass on > alien waters. David Brooks theorises in his 2011 book, The Sons of Clovis: Ern Malley, Ador√© Floupette and a Secret History of Australian Poetry, that the Ern Malley hoax was modelled on the 1885 satire on French Symbolism and the Decadent movement, Les D√©liquescences d'Ador√© Floupette, by Henri Beauclair and Gabriel Vicaire.\\"Ern, it turns out, has a French cousin\\" by Don Anderson, The Australian (1‚Äì2 October 2011) Stewart claimed to have never heard of Floupette at the time of the Ern Malley hoax, and while there is no evidence McAuley had, his Masters thesis titled \\"Symbolism: an essay in poetics\\", included a study of French Symboliste poetry and poetics.Heyward, Michael (June 2002). \\"The Ern Malley Affair\\", Jacket. Retrieved 22 March 2016.  Biography of \\"Ern Malley\\"  According to his inventors' fictitious biography, Ernest Lalor Malley was born in Liverpool, England, on 14 March 1918. His father died in 1920, and Malley's mother migrated to Petersham, a suburb of Sydney, Australia, with her two children: Ern, and his older sister Ethel. After his mother's death in August 1933, Ern Malley left school to work as an auto mechanic. Shortly after his seventeenth birthday, he then moved to Melbourne where he lived alone and worked as an insurance salesman, and later as a watch repairman. Diagnosed with Graves' disease sometime in the early 1940s, Malley refused treatment. He returned to Sydney, moving in with his sister in March, 1943, where he became increasingly ill (as well as temperamental and difficult) until his death at the age of 25 on 23 July of that same year. Malley's life as a poet became known only after his sister Ethel (another fictitious creation of McAuley and Stewart) found a pile of unpublished poems among his belongings. These poems featured a brief preface, which explained that they had been composed over a period of five years, but it left no instructions as to what was to be done with them. Ethel Malley supposedly knew nothing about poetry, but showed the poems to a friend, who suggested that she send the poems to someone who could examine them.Documentation of Ethel's action and other sources can be viewed online at the Ern Malley Feature, Jacket (Sydney), No. 7, June 2002, ed. John Tranter Max Harris of Angry Penguins was to be that someone.  Carrying out the hoax  McAuley and Stewart then sent Harris a letter, purported to be from Ethel, containing the poems, and asking for his opinion of her late brother's work. Harris read the poems with, as he later recalled, a mounting sense of excitement. Ern Malley, he thought, was a poet in the same class as W. H. Auden or Dylan Thomas. He showed them to his circle of literary friends, who agreed that a hitherto completely unknown modernist poet of great importance had been discovered in suburban Australia. He decided to rush out a special edition of Angry Penguins and commissioned a painting by Sidney Nolan, based on the poems, for the cover. The Autumn 1944 edition of Angry Penguins appeared in June 1944 owing to wartime printing delays. Harris eagerly promoted it around the small world of Australian writers and critics. The reaction was not what he had hoped or expected. An article appeared in the University of Adelaide student newspaper ridiculing the Malley poems and suggesting that Harris had written them himself in some elaborate hoax.  The hoax revealed  Max Harris with Angry Penguins artist Joy Hester On 17 June, the Adelaide Daily Mail raised the possibility that Harris was the hoaxed rather than the hoaxer. Alarmed, Harris hired a private detective to establish whether Ern and Ethel Malley existed or had ever done so. But by now, the Australian national press was on the trail. The next week, the Sydney Sunday Sun, which had been conducting some investigative reporting, ran a front-page story alleging that the Ern Malley poems had in fact been written by McAuley and Stewart. The South Australian police impounded the issue of Angry Penguins devoted to The Darkening Ecliptic on the grounds that Malley's poems were obscene.Lehman D 1998 \\"The Ern Malley Poetry Hoax ‚Äì Introduction\\" in Jacket, No. 17 The Ern Malley hoax was on the front pages of the newspapers for weeks, and Harris was humiliated. After the hoax was revealed, McAuley and Stewart wrote: > Mr. Max Harris and other Angry Penguins writers represent an Australian > outcrop of a literary fashion which has become prominent in England and > America. The distinctive feature of the fashion, it seemed to us, was that > it rendered its devotees insensible of absurdity and incapable of ordinary > discrimination. Our feeling was that by processes of critical self-delusion > and mutual admiration, the perpetrators of this humourless nonsense had > managed to pass it off on would-be intellectuals and Bohemians, both here > and abroad, as great poetry. [...] However, it was possible that we had > simply failed to penetrate to the inward substance of these productions. The > only way of settling the matter was by way of experiment. It was, after all, > fair enough. If Mr Harris proved to have sufficient discrimination to reject > the poems, then the tables would have been turned.  Immediate impact  The South Australian police prosecuted Harris for publishing immoral and obscene material. The only prosecution witness was a police detective, whose evidence is full of unintended humour: \\"Another evidence of indecency was the word 'incestuous'. Detective Volgelsang said: 'I don't know what \\"incestuous\\" means, but I think there is a suggestion of indecency about it'\\". Despite the woeful case, and several distinguished expert witnesses arguing for Harris, he was found guilty and fined ¬£5. Angry Penguins soon folded, although the magazine's demise had more to do with a libel case brought against Harris for an unconnected review and the emotional fallout from events in the open marriage of its backers John Reed and his wife, Sunday. Most people, including most educated people with an interest in the arts, were persuaded of the validity of McAuley and Stewart's \\"experiment.\\" The two had deliberately written bad poetry, passed it off under a plausible alias to the country's most prominent publisher of modernist poetry, and completely taken him in. Harris, they said, could not tell real poetry from fake, good from bad. The Ern Malley hoax had long-lasting repercussions. To quote the Oxford Companion to Australian Literature, \\"More important than the hoax itself was the effect it had on the development of Australian poetry. The vigorous and legitimate movement for modernism in Australian writing, espoused by many writers and critics in addition to the members of the Angry Penguins group, received a severe setback, and the conservative element was undoubtedly strengthened.\\" Controversy over Ern Malley continued for more than twenty years. It spread beyond Australia when it was learned that the British literary critic Herbert Read had been taken in by the hoax. Modernist novelists like Patrick White and abstract painters found themselves tarred with the Ern Malley brush. Since both McAuley and Stewart and the left-wing nationalist school around Vance and Nettie Palmer disliked the Angry Penguins version of modernism with equal venom, though for different reasons, Ern Malley cast a long shadow over Australian cultural life. In a 1975 interview with Earle Hackett, Sidney Nolan credited Ern Malley with inspiring him to paint his first Ned Kelly series (1946‚Äì47), saying \\"It made me take the risk of putting against the Australian bush an utterly strange object.\\"  McAuley, Stewart and Harris in later years  McAuley went on to publish several volumes of poetry and, with Richard Krygier, founded the literary and cultural journal Quadrant. From 1961 he was professor of English at the University of Tasmania. He died in 1976. Stewart settled permanently in Japan in 1966 and published two volumes of translations of traditional Japanese poetry which became best-sellers in Australia. He died in 1995. Harris, however, once he recovered from his humiliation in the Ern Malley hoax, made the best of his notoriety. From 1951 to 1955, he published another literary magazine, which he called Ern Malley's Journal. In 1961, as a gesture of defiance, he re-published the Ern Malley poems, maintaining that whatever McAuley and Stewart had intended to do, they had, in fact, produced some memorable poems. Harris went on to become a successful bookseller and newspaper columnist. His political views moved significantly to the right as he got older (he had been a member of the Communist Party at the time of the hoax), and in the mid-1960s, he claimed to sympathise with McAuley and Stewart's motivations in creating Ern Malley. Harris died in 1995.  Subsequent re-appreciation  The fictional Ern Malley achieved a measure of celebrity. The poems are regularly re-published and quoted. There have been at least 20 publications of the Darkening Ecliptic, either complete or partial. It has reappeared ‚Äì not only in Australia, but in London, Paris, Lyons, Kyoto, New York and Los Angeles ‚Äì with a regularity that would be the envy of any real Australian poet.Rainey, David. Ern Malley: The Hoax and Beyond. Melbourne: Heide Museum of Modern Art, 2009. , pp. 30‚Äì32. Some literary critics take the view that McAuley and Stewart outsmarted themselves in their concoction of the Ern Malley poems. \\"Sometimes the myth is greater than its creators,\\" Max Harris wrote. Harris, of course, had a vested interest in Malley, but others have agreed with his assessment. Robert Hughes wrote: > The basic case made by Ern's defenders was that his creation proved the > validity of surrealist procedures: that in letting down their guard, opening > themselves to free association and chance, McAuley and Stewart had reached > inspiration by the side-door of parody; and though this can't be argued on > behalf of all the poems, some of which are partly or wholly gibberish, it > contains a ponderable truth... The energy of invention that McAuley and > Stewart brought to their concoction of Ern Malley created an icon of > literary value, and that is why he continues to haunt our culture. In the \\"Individual Notes on Works and Authors\\" in the \\"Special Collaborations Issue\\" of Locus Solus, Kenneth Koch wrote, \\"Though Harris was wrong about who Ern Malley 'was' (if one can use that word here), I find it hard not to agree with his judgment of Malley's poetry.\\" The American poet John Ashbery said of Ern Malley, in a 1988 interview in the magazine Jacket: > I think it was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, and I > discovered a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry ‚Äì > which I'd never been able to lay my hands on very much until then ‚Äì and they > had the original edition of The Darkening Ecliptic with the Sidney Nolan > cover.

In 1974 the Art Gallery of South Australia‚Äôs Adelaide Festival Exhibitions included the Sidney Nolan exhibition \\"Ern Malley and Paradise Garden\\". The 2009 exhibition \\"Ern Malley: The Hoax and Beyond\\" at Heide Museum of Modern Art was the first exhibition to thoroughly investigate the genesis, reception and aftermath of the hoax. The final irony is enduring fame: Malley is better known and more widely read today than either McAuley or Stewart.  References to Ern Malley and the hoax  Angry Penguins artist Sidney Nolan created hundreds of Ern Malley-themed works, and credited the poems with inspiring him to paint his now-iconic Ned Kelly series. The Australian historian Humphrey McQueen alluded to the poems in calling his 1979 history of modernism in Australia The Black Swan of Trespass. Several works of fiction attribute the poems to a third party who actually wrote them; they then fall into the hands of McAuley and Stewart. In 1977 in Overland, Barbara Ker Wilson wrote a short story \\"Black Swan of Trespass\\", in which she has Davydd Davis, who presents as an antipodean Dylan Thomas, writing the poems. Malarky Dry, by Ian Kennedy Williams, was published in 1990 and tells of a sickly, insipid Ern who writes a manual of motorcycle maintenance while a boring bureaucrat Henry Fitzhubert- Ireland writes the poems. Two more recent fictions invent a \\"real\\" Ern: \\"Strangers in the House of the Mind\\" which appears in Martin Edmond's 2007 collection Waimarino County & Other Excursions, and David Malley's Beyond is Anything. Joanna Murray-Smith's play Angry Young Penguins (1987) is based on these events. Peter Carey's 2003 novel My Life as a Fake draws some of its inspiration from the Ern Malley affair. Elliot Perlman recounts the tale of the Ern Malley hoax in his 2003 novel Seven Types of Ambiguity. In 2005, The Black Swan of Trespass, a surrealist play about the real life of a fictional Ern Malley by Lally Katz and Chris Kohn, premiered at the Melbourne Malthouse Theatre. In the early years of the 21st century, the artist Garry Shead produced a series of well-received paintings based on the Ern Malley hoax. In the 2013 novel Cairo, after the success of a fictionalized version of the theft of the one of Picasso's studies for The Weeping Woman, one of characters quotes Malley's Durer: Innsbruck, 1495.

Before 1948  Following the 1947 UN Partition Plan, which divided the British Mandate of Palestine, the country became increasingly volatile and fell into a state of civil war between the Jews and Arabs after the Arab residents rejected any plan that would allow for the creation of a Jewish state. In accordance with Plan Dalet the Haganah tried to secure the areas allotted to the Jewish state in the partition plan and the blocks of settlements that were in the area allotted to the Arab state.  The first Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war  David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, proclaims the State of Israel, 14 May 1948 David Ben- Gurion proclaimed the Israeli Declaration of Independence on 14 May 1948. His first order was the formation of the IDF ‚Äì The Israel Defense Forces. The IDF was based on the personnel who had served in the Haganah and the Palmach and was declared as the only legal armed force in Israel. Another main source of manpower were the immigrants from Europe. Some of them Holocaust survivors and others veterans from World War II. Following the declaration of independence in 1948, Arab armies invaded Israel. Egypt came from the south, Lebanon and Syria from the north, and Jordan from the east backed by Iraqi and Saudi troops, in what Azzam Pasha, Arab League Secretary speaking on Cairo radio, declared would be \\"a war of extermination and a momentous massacre.\\" Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, Alfred A. Knopf, 1999, p. 219. In the initial phase of the war, the IDF was inferior in both numbers and armament. Invading Arab armies boasted 270 tanks, 150 field guns and 300 aircraft. The IDF had zero planes and three tanks.A.J. Barker, The Arab Israeli Wars, Hippocrene Books, 1981. Due to a number of reasons, the Arabs never managed to exploit their superiority in numbers. The Israelis managed to successfully defend themselves in virtually all battlefields with the notable exception of East Jerusalem. After the first truce 11 June to 8 July, the Israelis managed to seize the initiative due to new troop enrollments and supplies of arms. Notable achievements of the IDF include the conquest of Eilat (Um Rashrash), Nazareth, and the capture of the Galilee and the Negev. The war continued until 20 July 1949, when the armistice with Syria was signed. By then the IDF had managed to repel the Egyptians to the Gaza Strip while Jordan took over the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. See 1949 Armistice Agreements. Founding Members of the Yiftach Brigade in ceremony marking the establishment of the IDF. Sarafand 1948 The evolution from several underground militias to a state army is not simple. Many in the Haganah felt it was their High Command's natural role to become the leadership of the new army. The First Law of the Provisional State Council, Paragraph 18, of the Order of Government and Legal Arrangement stated that \\"the Provisional Government is empowered to set up armed forces on land, sea and air, which will be authorised to carry out all necessary and legal actions for the defence of the country.\\" The sensitivity of this issue is indicated by the delay of two weeks before, on 26 May 1948, David Ben-Gurion, for the Provisional Government, published the Israel Defense Forces Ordinance Number 4. It covered the establishment of the IDF, conscription duties, the oath of allegiance, and the prohibition of any other armed forces. The execution of the Ordinance was assigned to the Minister of Defence, David Ben-Gurion. His priority was the dissolution of military organisations affiliated to political parties. This led to a series of confrontations with leaders of the Palmach known as The General's Revolt. The army was officially set up on 31 May. This involved renaming existing Haganah and Palmach Brigades and bringing them under one central command. Its officers began to take their oaths of allegiance on 27 June.Peri, Yoram. Between battles and ballots ‚Äì Israeli military in politics. CUP, 1983. . pp. 52, 131, 132, 298. Lehi and Irgun came under central control in the following months. Despite several further ordinances the actual role and responsibilities of the Minister of Defense were not defined. Nor was there any legal definition of the Cabinet's civil authority over the army.De Gaury, Gerald, The New State of Israel. Derek Verschoyle Ltd, London. 1952. p. 183. General Amnesty Ordinance, 1949; Kosher Food for Soldiers Ordinance, 1949; Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance, 1948; Jerusalem Military Government (Confirmation) Ordinance, 1949 and the Firearms Ordinance, 1949. De Gaury suggests that the legal authority held by the High Commissioner under the Defences (Emergency) Regulations, 1945, was transferred to the Minister of Defence.  1949‚Äì1956  In those years the IDF started to rebuild itself as a modern army. It acquired heavier weapons and established an armored corps and the Israeli Air Force. In order to enhance the morale and organization of the army and to combat the resurgent problem with Palestinian infiltration, Unit 101 was formed. It was led by Ariel Sharon, and carried out a number of retaliatory strikes on Jordanian territory to deter the infiltrators. After committing the notorious Qibya Massacre in 1953 it was merged with the Paratroopers Battalions and Sharon became its commander. Unit 101 is regarded as the mother of the IDF's strike force units. In those years the IMI Uzi SMG and the FN FAL rifle were issued as standard infantry weapons.  The 1956 Sinai campaign  Shimon Peres, Israeli (former) Prime Minister and Minister of Defense: Negotiated France's military and nuclear aid to Israel. From 1954 and 1955 Egypt established a special force unit known as the Fedayeen. It led to the escalation of hostilities over the Israeli-Egyptian border and eventually contributed to the 1956 Suez War. In mid 1956, The Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser, encouraged by support from the Soviet Union, nationalized the Suez Canal. In response, United Kingdom and France planned Operation Musketeer (1956) aiming at regaining Western control of the Suez Canal and removing the Egyptian president Nasser. In late 1956, the bellicosity of recent Arab statements prompted Israel to remove the threat of the concentrated Egyptian forces in the Sinai, and Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai peninsula. Other Israeli aims were elimination of the Fedayeen incursions into Israel that made life unbearable for its southern population, and opening the blockaded Straits of Tiran for Israeli ships. Israeli armour, equipped with tanks, such as M4 Sherman and AMX-13 quickly defeated the Egyptian forces and took control over the Sinai within a few days. As agreed, within a couple of days, Britain and France invaded too and recaptured the canal. Britain, France and Israel withdrew from Sinai under international pressure, particularly by the United States. But the IDF had achieved numerous goals; the borders dramatically tranquilized, Nasser promised to disband the Fedayeen, the Straits of Tiran were once again opened to Israeli ships and maybe most important of all, Israel had illustrated its military strength. The successful war elevated the reputation of the IDF and contributed highly to the morale of the soldiers.  1956‚Äì1966  Following the successful campaign in Sinai, the IDF used this relatively quiet decade to arm on a great scale and increase military professionalism. The main suppliers of weapons was France, which provided Israel rifles, tanks and jet fighters, including the Dassault Mirage III. The peak of France's assistance was the construction of the Negev Nuclear Research Center near Dimona in 1960.  The 1967 Six-Day War  By 1966, Israeli-Arab relations had deteriorated to the point of actual battles taking place between Israeli and Arab forces. In 1967, Egypt expelled UN peacekeepers, stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since 1957, and announced a partial blockade of Israel's access to the Red Sea. In May 1967 a number of Arab states began to mobilize their forces. Israel saw these actions as a casus belli. On the morning of 5 June 1967, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) launched a massive airstrike that destroyed the majority of the Egyptian air force on the ground. By noon, the Egyptian, Jordanian and Syrian air forces, with about 450 aircraft, were annihilated. This strike was code-named Operation Focus, Mivtza Moked. The Egyptians persuaded Syria and Jordan to join the war by lying to them and reporting on \\"amazing victories\\" at Sinai. The two Arab countries reluctantly joined the war, Jordan by shelling the Israeli part of Jerusalem and Syria by entering Israel from the Golan Heights. Meanwhile, the IDF ground forces quickly overran the Egyptian army in Sinai and were about to reach Alexandria. About 15,000 Egyptian soldiers were killed, 4482 fell into captivity and 80% of the Egyptian tanks were destroyed. 338 Israeli were killed in Sinai and of Israel's losses there were about 63 tanks. All of the Sinai peninsula was captured. The IDF later captured the Golan Heights from the Syrians and the West Bank from Jordan. On 7 June Israeli troops (the Harel unit; Yerushalmi unit; and elite paratroopers accompanied by tanks) captured the Old City of Jerusalem The conquest of the Western Wall and Temple Mount was considered as the highlights of the war and a dramatic and emotional peak by the Israeli people. The reunification of east and west Jerusalem as one city under Jewish control were celebrated widely in Israel. The Six-Day War had great consequences for the state of Israel and the IDF. In six days Israel had defeated three Arab armies ‚Äì Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Yitzhak Rabin, Moshe Dayan, Israel Tal, Moshe Peled and Mordechai Gur were admired by the public as \\"war heroes\\" while the IAF pilots won unprecedented prestige and were considered to be \\"the best pilots in the world\\" (even today, the IAF is considered to be one of the most competent air forces in the world). The 1968‚Äì1970 War of Attrition Israel's alleged pre-emptive strike in the Six Day War resulted in a French embargo banning all weapon sales to Israel. Israel overcame the embargo by finding other suppliers (such as the United States) and developing and making its own weapons. A strategic decision was made then to make an Israeli battle tank, an Israeli fighter jet, and an Israeli warship ‚Äì for example: the Kfir fighter jet and the Merkava tank. After the Six-Day War was over, IDF outposts on the Suez Canal were shelled by the Egyptian army. It was a long and bitter war that ended after three years due to Israeli air superiority. There were also frictions and battles with Syrian forces on the northern border. In the Israeli reprisal operation (\\"Three Day Battles\\" 24‚Äì27 June 1970) about 350 Syrian soldiers were killed. The 1973 Yom Kippur War The Yom Kippur War, also known as the \\"10th of Ramadan War\\" in Arab countries, tempered Israeli confidence created after the victory of the Six-Day War. This time, Jordan stayed out and wasn't involved in the war. The war opened on 6 October 1973 on Yom Kippur, the holiest Jewish holiday. Egypt and Syria attempted to regain the territory Israel had acquired in its defensive war in 1967, known as the Six-Day War. Their armies launched a joint surprise attack on the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday (the most sacred Jewish day of all in which each Jew must atone for his sins, pray and avoid eating and drinking) ‚Äì the Syrian forces attacking fortifications in the Golan Heights and the Egyptian forces attacking fortifications around the Suez Canal and on the Sinai Peninsula. The troops inflicted heavy casualties on the Israeli army. After three weeks of fighting, though, and with U.S. air-lifted reinforcements of weapons and equipment (first shipment arrived on 9 October 1973), the IDF pushed the Syrian forces beyond the original lines. In the Golan Heights, small groups of tank commanders such as Avigdor Kahalani managed to hold back dozens of Syrian tanks. By 10 October, the IDF recaptured the entire Golan Heights and on 11 October Israeli armored forces invaded Syria and destroyed the Iraqi reinforcements. On 22 October, the Golani infantry brigade captured Mount Hermon (an important strategic outpost). In the Sinai Peninsula, Israeli armor was unable to prevent or push back Egyptian infantry crossing the Suez Canal. Most of the fortified Bar Lev Line was captured within the first two days of the war. Subsequent Israeli counterattacks launched by reserve forces arriving to the front were disastrous, and the Israelis were forced to withdraw to a new defensive line. On 14 October, the Israelis repelled a renewed Egyptian attack, and the following day launched their counteroffensive. On 16 October the Israelis crossed the Suez Canal and attempted to capture the towns of Ismailia and Suez and to cut off Egyptian supply lines. The Israelis failed to capture either town, but succeeded on 24 October in cutting off the supply lines of the Egyptian Third Army to the south after breaking for a few hours a United Nations ceasefire resolution. The price of the war was heavy. 2,800 Israelis were killed and 9,000 were wounded. About 300 Israeli soldiers were taken captive.* Available online Egyptian and Syrian casualties are estimated at around 15,000 and about 30,000 were wounded. 8,300 Egyptian soldiers and 400 Syrian soldiers were captured. In Israel, the war caused a public outrage, forcing the government to appoint an investigation commission. The Agranat Commission found serious flaws in the functioning of the intelligence forecasting branch, which failed to foresee the war and ignored various warnings. The Chief of Staff, David Elazar (\\"Dado\\") resigned after harsh criticism by the commission. Although the commission praised Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir on her leadership during the war, she resigned following the war and was replaced by Yitzhak Rabin.  1974‚Äì1978  Until 1974, the IDF was countering Syrian and Egyptian attacks meant to weaken IDF posts on the border and force the Israeli government to withdraw. However, the IDF managed to sustain low casualties. The IDF reprisal strikes on the Egyptians and Syrians inflicted heavy casualties. After international negotiations in 1974, the attacks stopped. Following the French embargo and the U.S. air-lift of supplies, weapons and ammunition, the IDF started to base itself upon American and Israeli made weapons and technologies. The American M16 assault rifle entered service along with the Galil assault rifle ‚Äì an Israeli variant of the Soviet AK-47. M14 were issued as sniper rifles along with surplus of M1 Carbines given to the Police. In those years the IDF invested most of its efforts in countering international terror, such as the Munich Massacre, committed by the PLO following its deportion from Jordan to Lebanon in the \\"Black September\\" of 1970. The PLO focused mainly on hijacking airlines and kidnapping and its terrorists hijacked several commercial airline flights. In 1976, a group of PLO terrorist hijacked an airliner with 83 Israeli passengers and held them hostages in the Entebbe airport in Uganda. Israeli elite SF unit ‚Äì Sayeret Matkal ‚Äì went on a complex hostages-rescue operation and managed to save 80 of the passengers, with only one soldier lost, the commander, lt. colonel Yonatan Netanyahu, the elder brother of Benjamin Netanyahu. The operation, officially called Operation Johnathan but widely referred to as Operation Entebbe, is regarded by military experts as one of the brightest and most successful covert operations ever conducted. In those years the IAF received a new generation of warplanes. In 1977 the first F-15 Eagle American warplanes arrived in Israel and only a year later, they logged their first kill in the world when IAF F-15s shot down Syrian MiG (Mikoyan-Gurevich) fighters. In 1980 the F-16 Fighting Falcon arrived and the model's first aerial kill was also credited to the Israeli Air Force. 1978 Operation Litani Because of waves of terrorist attacks (most notable is the road massacre of 37 civilians) coming from the PLO in Lebanon, the IDF undertook Operation Litani, a wide-ranging and thorough anti-terrorist operation that included occupying part of Southern Lebanon in 1978. 1979‚Äì1981 In 1979 the first Israeli-made Merkava Mk1 main battle tank entered service. The tank was fully developed and manufactured by Israel and exceeded the enemies' tanks in every parameter. It first saw active service in Lebanon and proved to be a great success. In 1979 the Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty was signed, when Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat agreed on peace in return for Israel returning the entire Sinai Peninsula to Egypt. The peace agreement, still valid today, closed the bitter southern front and let the IDF focus on the raging northern border. In 1981 the Israeli Air Force destroyed Iraq's Osiraq nuclear reactor. The Israeli government suspected that the Iraqis would use the nuclear reactor to build atomic weapons (WMD). On 7 June, four F-16 fighters, covered by F-15 jets, flew 1,100 km to Iraq from Israel, and bombed the nuclear reactor, thus, thwarting the Iraqi nuclear program and severely holding back the Iraqi plans for getting a nuclear bomb. 1982 Operation Peace for Galilee On 6 June 1982, following an assassination attempt against its ambassador in London by the Abu Nidal Organization, Israeli forces under direction of Defense Minister Ariel Sharon invaded southern Lebanon in their \\"Operation Peace for the Galilee\\". They eventually reached as far north as the capital Beirut in an attempt to drive the PLO forces out of the country. In 1987 a revolt erupted in the Palestinian territories, leading to the Oslo Accords. Although the Israelis did succeed in driving the PLO from Beirut and out of Lebanon, they had to remain within southern Lebanon for the next 18 years to secure a buffer zone between other terrorist groups supported by Syria operating in Lebanon and Israel. In 2000, in response to a UN resolution calling for this buffer zone to be maintained by the Lebanese government, and for the Syria to end its occupation of Lebanon, Israel withdrew its troops. Although Syria eventually withdrew from Lebanon, it maintained its influence via Hezbollah who continued to attack Northern Israel long after the withdrawal had been certified by UNIFL. Four years later, the UN passed resolution 1559 calling for disarming Hezbollah. The failure of the Lebanese government to do so has led to the strengthening of Hezbollah's militants and to the building of an immense arsenal of 13,000 rockets all aimed at civilian centers within Israel. The rocket attacks by Hezbollah continued unabated for the next two years, and it was these attacks coupled with the incursion of Hezbollah militants into Northern Israel to kill and kidnap IDF soldiers that led to the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. 1987‚Äì1993 First Intifada 2000‚Äì2005 Second Intifada 2006 Lebanon War Map showing Israeli localities attacked by rockets fired from Lebanese soil as of Sunday, 16 July. After the abduction of an Israeli soldier by Hamas on 25 June, the IDF began an air and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip to get back their kidnapped soldier, and end the fire of rockets onto Israeli territory. At 9:05 am on 12 July Hezbollah's military wing staged a cross-border attack on two Israeli Humvees. The attacks came two weeks after the beginning of the Gaza-focused Operation Summer Rains. Eight Israeli soldiers were killed and two were captured. Later on 12 July Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called the captures an \\"act of war\\" warranting a \\"severe and harsh response\\" and threatened to \\"turn Lebanon's clock back 20 years.\\" In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a military offensive into Lebanon. In the following days, hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah increased to a point of both parties exchanging tough rhetoric and escalating into deadly military campaigns. Israel proceeded by destroying energy and transportation infrastructure throughout Lebanon, focusing on highway infrastructure initially claiming they were trying to prevent the kidnapped soldiers from being removed to Iran. Israeli sources later justified their assault on the infrastructure claiming the roads and airports are used to transport the missiles launched from southern Lebanon toward Israeli civilian population centers. After several days of Israeli attacks Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah declared an \\"open war\\" with Israel. IDF Special Operations took place within the borders of Lebanon. On 22 July Israeli troops in large numbers moved into Lebanon to demolish Hezbollah outposts, and diminish Hezbollah missile capabilities. 2008‚Äì2009 Gaza War 2012 Pillar of Defense 2014 Protective Edge Appendices = List of Chiefs of the General Staff = = Other famous generals and soldiers = F-16 pilot and astronaut Ilan Ramon * Yanush Ben Gal, Yom Kippur War hero, held back Syrian forces * Tat-Aluf (Brigadier General) Efi Eitam, head of the National Religious Party * Aluf (Major General) Yair Naveh, highest ranking religious combat general * Tat-Aluf Arie Eldad, chief military physician, professor of medicine * Aluf-Mishne (Colonel) Imad Fares, Druze officer, commander of Givati Brigade (2001‚Äì2003) *Amos Yarkoni, the first commander of the Shaked Reconnaissance Battalion of the Givati Brigade, and one of six Israeli Arabs to be awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service * Meir Har- Zion, Unit 101 commando raider * Avigdor Kahalani, Yom Kippur War general, held back Syrian forces * Zvika Greengold, tank commander who fought against enormous odds in the Golan Heights in the early hours of the Yom Kippur War * Colonel Yonatan Netanyahu, a war hero of Sayeret Matkal, killed in Operation Entebbe * Meir Pail, commander of the IDF officers' college, and military historian * Aluf (Major General) \\"Musa\\" Moshe Peled, armor general * Aluf Mishne Ilan Ramon, senior F-16 pilot, bombed Iraqi reactor in 1981, first Israeli astronaut, died in the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster * Aluf Ariel Sharon, commander of Unit 101, general of armored division during Yom Kippur War, prime minister until 11 April 2006. * Tat-Aluf Yiftah Spector, senior F-16 pilot, bombed Iraqi reactor * Aluf \\"Talik\\" Israel Tal, the \\"Father\\" of the Merkava main battle tank project * Aluf Matan Vilnai, general and Labour Party member * Aluf Amram Mitzna, general, former Labor party leader * Aluf Itzhak Mordechai, senior paratroop commander, former defense minister * Admiral Ami Ayalon, commander of the Israeli Navy and later head of the Shin Bet internal security service. * Aluf Meir Zorea, Major-General and Commander of Tank Corps during 1967 War.

The yellow area at the top is Camp Coiner. Yongsan Garrison (; Hanja: ), meaning \\"dragon hill garrison,\\" is an area roughly two-thirds the size of New York's Central Park located in the Yongsan District of central Seoul, South Korea. The site served as the headquarters for U.S. military forces stationed in South Korea, known as United States Forces Korea (USFK), and as United States Army Garrison Yongsan (USAG-Yongsan) until 2018, under the supervision of the U.S. Army's Installation Management Command Pacific Region. From 1910 to 1945 it served as headquarters for the Imperial Japanese Army in Korea. The USFK headquarters relocated to the new $11 billion Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek south of Seoul in 2018, as part of the Yongsan Relocation Plan.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/11/03/new-u-s-base-not- entirely-out-range-north-korea/816930001/ By the end of 2019, more than 20,000 U.S. troops and family members will have been relocated to the new Camp Humphreys facility south of Seoul. While most of the land will be returned to the South Korean government, the U.S. will retain a small portion of land in order to keep open the Dragon Hill Lodge military resort hotel and for a future site to relocate the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. Korean officials are still debating the future use of the land being returned, with some calling for a large park and others calling for more affordable housing. History Yongsan land had traditionally been the site of military facilities under former Korean kingdoms. In 1882, Qing troops used it during the Imo Incident. During those times, Korean and Japanese garrisons were on the outskirts of the city in mostly undeveloped land. The Imperial Japanese Army originally created it as a garrison and from 1910 to 1945 it served as its headquarters. Since then, the city of Seoul has spread, to envelop Yongsan Garrison. Yongsan Garrison has been used by the United States Army as Garrison Yongsan (USAG-Yongsan), under the supervision of the Installation Management Command Pacific Region. In November 1992 some 297,000 square meters (77 acres) of land, including a golf course, was given back to the City of Seoul to become Yongsan Family Park and the site of the recently opened National Museum of Korea. The opening of the completed National Museum was delayed several years while the fate of a U.S. Army helicopter landing facility (H-208) was decided (its approach path and landing pads were directly in front of the museum). In April 2003 South Korea and the United States agreed on the early relocation of Yongsan garrison outside of central Seoul. In August 2008, U.S. President George W. Bush spoke to U.S. and South Korean military personnel, their families, and civilian employees at Yongsan Garrison's Collier Field House, 6 as part of his final visit to Asia. During his speech, Bush said,\\"Fifty-five years have passed since the guns went quiet and the cease-fire was signed on this peninsula, and since that time our forces have kept the peace. Our nations have built a robust alliance\\". He also said that the U.S. would keep its military in South Korea, while returning some bases to South Korean control. In February 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited senior U.S. and South Korean military leaders at the Combined Forces Command headquarters at Yongsan Garrison on her first official trip overseas as the United States' Secretary of State. In 2009 The Korea Times reported that defense ministry officials said that South Korea and the United States have agreed to complete the relocation of the U.S. military headquarters in Yongsan to an expanded military base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, by 2014. The plan was delayed to 2018. The 2018 estimates place the relocation completing in 2019 or 2020. South Korea had traditionally regarded this garrison as insurance against the U.S. Army abandoning Seoul, located only about 65 km from the DMZ. As part of the relocation and the planned withdrawal of U.S. troops near the DMZ, all American troops would be pulled back from north of the Han River. A December 2014 agreement between the South Koreans and the U.S. declared that one U.S. Army brigade would be allowed to remain \\"north of the Han River\\"; it is believed this means on or near the present U.S. Army Camp Casey in Dongducheon City. The Embassy of the United States in Seoul may build a new Chancery on part of the land planned to be vacated by the U.S. Army, most probably on Camp Coiner. Most of the U.S. Embassy officials live in an Embassy housing compound in an area almost completely enveloped by Yongsan Garrison, and with direct access to it. Facilities Many of the older, dark-colored brick buildings on the base are former Japanese Army buildings and are used by U.S. forces, most notably the Eighth Army headquarters building. Directly across from Eighth Army headquarters is the Combined Forces Command and U.S. Forces Korea headquarters, a structure built in the early 1970s. The building is home to the Commanding General, United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command and U.S. Forces Korea. Facilities include multiple family housing areas, a large commissary and Post Exchange, Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation facilities, restaurants, indoor and outdoor sports complexes, a library, a bowling alley, a skateboard park, a miniature golf complex, a hospital, a dental clinic, three Department of Defense Dependent Schools, a United Service Organization (USO), child development centers, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, an automotive care center, and a self-service gas station. The garrison is also home to the Dragon Hill Lodge, a hotel which is operated as an Armed Forces Recreation Center by the U.S. Army in support of personnel assigned or employed by the U.S. Forces Korea, their family members, and guests. The garrison consists of two main parts: Main Post (North Post) and South Post, which are physically divided by Itaewon-ro, a four-lane city boulevard. In 2003, a two-lane overpass bridge was constructed over this boulevard to solve traffic congestion. The garrison provides installation support for K-16 Air Base, Camp Kim, Sungnam Golf Course, and Camp Coiner. Camp Coiner, covering approximately 50 acres (200,000 m2) on Yongsan Garrison's northern edge, is named after 2nd Lt. Randall Coiner, a Korean War Silver Star recipient. Until 2014, it also an supported an outlying U.S. Army housing area called Hannam Village in Hannam-dong; that site was sold in 2016 to private developers and, as of 2018, redevelopment as luxury housing was underway.http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2016/05/123_204098.html After the Korean War it served as Korea's primary in-processing facility for Army troops. (As of 2008, the 1st Replacement Company (1RC), a part of the Yongsan Readiness Center, serves as the central in-processing and orientation center for U.S. servicemembers and their families arriving to Korea.) There was an Officers' Club, NCO Club and Enlisted Club in the camp. Collier Field House serves as the garrison's primary fitness center. Named in honor of Corporal John Collier, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his service during the Korean War, this sports complex is on Yongsan South Post and features basketball, racquetball, volleyball, baseball, softball, aerobic, and weight training facilities. It offers authorized patrons instructor-lead fitness training programs. The Collier Field House is used for community events and town hall meetings. The single family suburban style housing areas, with yards and tree lined streets, plus the small wooded areas throughout the Garrison stand in stark contrast to the highly urbanized areas surrounding the facility. The War Memorial of Korea directly abuts the garrison. Before the construction of this museum, the land was part of the Korean military command and was only slightly separated from the U.S. Army facility, both having been part of the original Japanese Garrison. Outside the garrison, east of the compound is the commercial district of Itaewon, with westernized shopping and nightlife. To the west of Yongsan is the Samgakji subway station and Yongsan Electronics Market. Although access to the garrison is controlled at the gates, it was possible for larger-than-normal drops of North Korean propaganda (leaflets and CDs) to occur at Yongsan Garrison, as recently as 22 December 2017. US troops were cautioned not to handle the materials themselves but to report them to Eighth Army G2X (counterintelligence).Army Times (22 December 2017) \\"US military warns about North Korean propaganda at Yongsan Garrison\\" =Administration= Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits USAG-Yongsan 20 February 2009.

Bush spoke to military personnel, their families and civilian employees at Collier Field House while visiting U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan, 6 August 2008. Yongsan Garrison is commanded by a U.S. Army colonel and is one of four U.S. Army Installation Management Command Pacific Region(IMCOM-P) garrisons in the Republic of Korea, and one of 179 such garrisons worldwide. IMCOM-P is a military organization primarily to provide the United States Army in Korea the installation capabilities and services to support operations, and to provide a quality of life for soldiers and their families. IMCOM-P is the Korean regional office of the Installation Management Command headquartered in Hawaii. =Army Family Covenant= In December 2007 Yongsan Garrison officials and the IMCOM-Korean commanding general pledged their support to develop and improve family programs during an Army Family Covenant signing ceremony. According to garrison officials, \\"The Army Family Covenant is our commitment to deliver a quality of life commensurate to our Soldiers' service.\\" During the ceremony, the Yongsan Garrison commander cited recent improvements to family programs at the USAG-Yongsan, such as elimination of initial registration fees for child care, extended hours for respite care and extended-duty child care, and expanded programs for teens and after-school care, including youth sports. The Army committed $1.4 billion to family programs in fiscal 2008. =Army Family Housing= The garrison's primary housing areas include Loring Village, Lloyd L. Burke Towers, Watkins Ridge and Krzyzowski Hills. Commonly known as Black Hawk Housing Area, Loring Village consists of 16 housing structures, each containing multiple housing units, and was named after U.S. Air Force Major Charles Loring, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his service during the Korean War. In 2004, South Korean-funded construction of the Lloyd L. Burke Towers (commonly known as Burke Towers) was completed . Consisting of two five-story towers, the housing area includes three-, four- and five bedroom units, as well as outdoor barbecue areas, a basketball court and underground parking facility. The towers were named after Army 1st Lt. Lloyd L. Burke, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his service during the Korean War. Watkins Ridge housing area consists of 23 housing structures, each containing multiple housing units, and was named after Army Master Sergeant Travis Watkins, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his service during the Korean War. Krzyzowski Hills housing area consists of 10 housing structures, with multiple housing units each and named after Army Captain Edward Krzyzowski, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his service during the Korean War. Unaccompanied military personnel are assigned to Unaccompanied Personnel Housing on-post such as barracks, Bachelor Enlisted Quarters (BEQ), Senior Enlisted Quarters (SEQ), or Bachelor Officer Quarters (BOQ). When on-post housing is not available, unaccompanied military personnel are assigned to off-post quarters. =Army Community of Excellence= In 2008, Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Richard A. Cody recognized Yongsan Garrison as one of the top three U.S. Army Installations in the World and recognized the garrison by declaring it an Army Community of Excellence. The ACOE competition recognizes excellence in installation management and encourages and rewards installations that optimize opportunities and demonstrate a commitment to service and excellence. Of 179 Army installations, Yongsan placed third behind second- place Fort George G. Meade, Md., and first-place finisher Fort A.P. Hill, Va. =Brian Allgood Army Community Hospital= Yongsan Garrison was home to the Brian Allgood Army Community Hospital (BAACH).http://www.seoul.amedd.army.mil/level2/default_2.asp?pages=main&types;=121&from;=2 The main tenant unit residing in BAACH was the 121st Combat Support Hospital, providing the staff for inpatient and outpatient care. The staff included a mix of active duty soldiers, civilians employees, and Korean employees. It was originally activated in 1944 as the 121st Evacuation Hospital, Semimobile.http://www.seoul.amedd.army.mil/level2/sub/u_introduce.asp?pages=intro&types;=121&from;=2&menu;=introduction%20of%20unit It participated in the European Theater during World War II and in the Korean War. It has served continuously in Korea as a field unit since 25 September 1950 and as fixed medical treatment facility, Seoul Military Hospital, since 1959. In 1971, Seoul Military Hospital merged with the 121st Evacuation Hospital to become the U.S. Army Hospital, Seoul (121st Evacuation Hospital). On 16 April 1994, the 121st Evacuation Hospital reorganized and was redesignated the 121st General Hospital. On 30 June 2008 the facility was formally renamed the Brian D. Allgood Army Community Hospital. Colonel Allgood served as the commander at this hospital from June 2004 through June 2006. Allgood's final assignment was July 2006 when he was posted as the Command Surgeon Multi-National Forces-Iraq (MNF-I). On 20 January 2007, he, along with 11 other U.S. service members, were killed in action when their UH-60 helicopter was shot down by enemy rocket fire in Iraq. In September 2019, BAACH completed its relocation from Yongsan to Camp Humphreys.https://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/after-a-long-wait-us-military- dedicates-new-275-million-hospital-at-camp-humphreys-1.599698 =Department of Defense Dependent Schools= Seoul American High School (SAHS) is on Yongsan Garrison. The school complex comprises eight buildings, containing over 60 classrooms and special purpose rooms. The school has two combination faculty lounges and work areas. A library/media center houses 12,000 books and audio visual materials. The educator staff of 70 is composed of the Department of Defense Dependent Schools education specialists and classroom teachers. SAHS opened in 1959 with approximately 150 students. The first class graduated in 1960. The classrooms at that time were Quonset huts located across from the main Army Community Service building. Taegu, Pusan, and Chinhae students boarded at SAHS as there were no high schools in those areas until 1967. In the fall of 1967, Taegu opened its high school, which alleviated the long drive for students. Construction began on the new high school in 1981 and was completed in the fall of 1982. In addition to the main, arts, and gymnasium buildings a new structure which includes a JROTC section was opened in 1987. The JROTC facilities have two classrooms, three offices, supply room, arms room, four-point indoor rifle range, and a hard top area used for inspections and drills. Additionally, JROTC formal inspections are held on the Falcon Fields, the school's full-sized artificial turf football and soccer field. School year, 1995‚Äì96 Seoul American High School had 550 students. This year enrollment is 630. SAHS is one of the larger schools in DoDDS Pacific and has a reputation for being one of the leading academic schools. Every year SAHS ranks in the top 15% of high schools academics. Over the summer of 2009, SAHS Football/soccer field recently had \\"stadium lights\\" placed along the side of the fields, which can be easily seen when driving by the field, fulfilling their part in the \\"American Dream\\". The tennis court was also taken out and replaced with a new building due to an influx of students from the states. Seoul American Middle School (SAMS) and Seoul American Elementary School (SAES) are on Yongsan Garrison. In 2008, to accommodate an increase in student population, a classroom building was constructed on the SAMS campus. The new building's six classrooms ‚Äì each ‚Äì accommodate up to about 170 Department of Defense Dependent Schools students. The SAES campus consists of seven buildings and a cafeteria. The main building houses primary classrooms, the Information Center, the Dolphin Theater, and computer labs. Grades 3, 4 and 5 and some Kindergarten classrooms are located in outlying buildings. SAES is one of the largest schools in DoDDS and ranked as one of the highest in academic performance. There are about 1,100 students at Seoul American Elementary School. The staff consists of over 90 professional educators, 20 educational aides and 10 clerical personnel. The school's curriculum is based on the U.S. National Standards with special classes including Art, Music, Physical Education, Computer and Korean Culture.

Legacy As countless USFK personnel as well as Korean civilians have lived and worked on base, Yongsan Garrison has had far-reaching influence on Korea's society and development. Historians have been rushing to archive Yongsan's history, tracing its influence in areas including music, art, cuisine, medicine, engineering and so on, for the Yongsan Legacy project so it won't be forgotten after physical traces have disappeared.

His first novel, Broken Earth was published when he was seventeen (under his \\"Methodist name\\"), but it was over fifty years until his next publication, a collection of verse entitled Nine Lives. He won numerous literary awards including the gold Molteno Award for lifetime services to South African literature, and in 1996 his works were translated into French. His autobiography, Mr Chameleon, was published posthumously in 2005. Biography Tatamkhulu Afrika was born Mogamed Fu'ad Nasif in Egypt to an Egyptian father and a Turkish mother, and came to South Africa as a very young child. Both his parents died of flu, and he was fostered by family friends under the name John Carlton. He fought in World War II in the North African Campaign and was captured at Tobruk. His experiences as a prisoner of war featured prominently in his writing. After World War II he left his foster family and went to Namibia (then South-West Africa), where he was fostered by an Afrikaans family, taking his third legal name of Jozua Joubert. In 1964 he converted to Islam and his name was again legally changed to Ismail Joubert. He lived in Cape Town's District 6, a mixed race inner-city community. District 6 was declared a \\"whites only\\" area in the 1960s and the community was destroyed. With an Arab father and a Turkish mother, Afrika could have been classified as a \\"white\\", but refused as a matter of principle. He founded Al-Jihaad to oppose the destruction of District Six and apartheid in general, and when this became affiliated with the African National Congress' armed wing, Umkhonto We Sizwe, he was given the praise name of Tatamkhulu Afrika, which he adopted until he died. In 1987 he was arrested for terrorism and banned from speaking or writing in public for five years, although he continued writing under the name of Tatamkhulu Afrika. He was imprisoned in the same prison as Nelson Mandela and was released in 1992. Tatamkulu Afrika died on 23 December 2002 shortly after his 82nd birthday, from injuries received when he was run over by a car two weeks before, just after the publication of his final novel, Bitter Eden. He left a number of unpublished works, including his autobiography, two novels, four short novels, two plays and poetry.

J. Abramowitch, was a Jewish author and one of the founders of modern Yiddish and Hebrew literature. Youth Mendele was born to a poor family in Kapyl in Minsk Governorate. His father, Chaim Moyshe Broyde, died shortly after Mendele became Bar Mitzvah. He studied in yeshiva in Slutsk and Vilna until he was 17; during this time he was a day- boarder under the system of Teg-Essen, barely scraping by, and often hungry. Mendele next traveled extensively around Belarus, Ukraine and Lithuania at the mercy of an abusive beggar named Avreml Khromoy (Russian for \\"Avreml the Lame\\"); Avreml would later become the source for the title character of Fishke der Krumer (Fishke the Lame). In 1854, Mendele settled in Kamianets-Podilskyi, where he got to know writer and poet Avrom Ber Gotlober, who helped him to understand secular culture, philosophy, literature, history, Russian and other languages. Early work Mendele's first article, \\"Letter on Education\\", appeared in 1857, in the first Hebrew newspaper, Hamagid; his mentor Gotlober submitted Mendele's school paper without Mendele's prior knowledge. At Berdychiv in the Ukraine, where he lived from 1858 to 1869, he began to publish fiction both in Hebrew and Yiddish. Having offended the local powers with his satire, he left Berdichev to train as a rabbi at the relatively theologically liberal, government-sponsored rabbinical school in Zhytomyr, where he lived from 1869 to 1881, and became the head of the traditional school (Talmud Torah) in Odessa in 1881. He lived in Odessa until his death in 1917, except for two years in Geneva, where he fled the government-inspired pogroms following the failed revolution of 1905.Stillman, Gerald (1991). \\"Introduction: A Summary of Mendele's Life, Work, and Times\\", in: Selected Works of Mendele Moykher-Sforim, edited by Marvin S. Zuckerman, Stillman, and Marion Herbst. Vol. 1 of the series \\"The Three Great Classic Writers of Modern Yiddish Literature\\". Joseph Simon/Pangloss Press. Grandfather of Yiddish literature Mendele initially wrote in Hebrew, coining many words in that language, but ultimately switched to Yiddish in order to expand his audience. Like Sholem Aleichem, he used a pseudonym because of the perception at the time that as a ghetto vernacular, Yiddish was not suited to serious literary work ‚Äî an idea he did much to dispel. His writing strongly bore the mark of the Haskalah. He is considered by many to be the \\"grandfather of Yiddish literature\\", an epithet first accorded to him by Sholem Aleichem, in the dedication to his novel Stempenyu. Mendele's style in both Hebrew and Yiddish has strongly influenced several generations of later writers. While the tradition of journalism in Yiddish had a bit more of a history than in Hebrew, Kol Mevasser, which he supported from the outset and where he published his first Yiddish story, \\"Dos kleyne Mentshele\\" (The Little Man), in 1863, is generally seen as the first stable and important Yiddish newspaper. Ideology and later work The Odessa literary group in 1916; from left to right: Yehoshua Ravnitzki (1859-1944), Shloyme Ansky, Mendele M. Sforim, Hayim N. Bialik, Simon Frug. Sol Liptzin writes that in his early Yiddish narratives, Mendele \\"wanted to be useful to his people rather than gain literary laurels\\".Liptzin, Sol (1972). A History of Yiddish Literature. Middle Village, NY: Jonathan David Publishers. p. 42. Two of his early works, the story \\"Dos kleyne mentshele\\" (◊ì◊ê◊° ◊ß◊ú◊ô◊ô◊†◊¢ ◊û◊¢◊†◊ò◊©◊¢◊ú◊¢), and the unstaged 1869 drama Di Takse (The Tax), condemned the corruption by which religious taxes (in the latter case, specifically the tax on kosher meat) were diverted to benefit community leaders rather than the poor. This satiric tendency continued in Di Klatshe (The Nag; 1873) about a prince, a stand-in for the Jewish people, who is bewitched and becomes a much put-upon beast of burden, but maintains his moral superiority throughout his sufferings (a theme evidently influenced by Apuleius's classical picaresque novel The Golden Ass). His later work became more humane and less satiric, starting with Fishke der Krumer (◊§◊ô◊©◊ß◊¢ ◊ì◊¢◊® ◊ß◊®◊ï◊û◊¢◊®; written 1868-1888) - which was adapted as a film of the same title in 1939 (known in English as The Light Ahead) - and continuing with the unfinished Masoes Benyomin Hashlishi (◊û◊°◊¢◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊†◊ô◊û◊ô◊ü ◊î◊©◊ú◊ô◊©◊ô; The Travels of Benjamin III; 1878), something of a Jewish Don Quixote. (The title is a reference to the well-known travel book of the Medieval Spanish-Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela.) In 1938, this work was adapted by as a play for the J√ºdischer Kulturbund in Germany, and performed there shortly after Kristallnacht (the Night of Broken Glass), in November of that year. As with Fishke, Mendele worked on and off for decades on his long novel Dos Vinshfingeril (The Wishing Ring; 1865‚Äì1889), with at least two versions preceding the final one. It is the story of a maskil ‚Äî that is, a supporter of the Haskalah, like Mendele himself ‚Äî who escapes a poor town, survives misery to obtain a secular education much like Mendele's own, but is driven by the pogroms of the 1880s from his dreams of universal brotherhood to one of Jewish nationalism. The first English translation, by Michael Wex (author of Born to Kvetch), was published in 2003.

The facing folio, 116v, contains an illumination of the three Maries approaching the tomb. The Pericopes of Henry II (; Munich, Bavarian State Library, Clm 4452) is a luxurious medieval illuminated manuscript made for Henry II, the last Ottonian Holy Roman Emperor, made 1002 - 1012 AD. The manuscript, which is lavishly illuminated, is a product of the Liuthar circle of illuminators, who were working in the Benedictine Abbey of Reichenau, which housed a scriptorium and artists' workshop that has a claim to having been the largest and artistically most influential in Europe during the late 10th and early 11th centuries. An unrivalled series of liturgical manuscripts was produced at Reichenau under the highest patronage of Ottonian society. (Other centers include scriptoria at Lorsch, Trier and Regensburg.) Unlike a Gospel Book, gospel pericopes contain only the passages from the gospels which are to be read during the liturgical year, making it easier for the priest celebrating Mass to find the gospel reading. It is 425 mm by 320 mm and has 206 vellum folios. Style of the miniatures The style of the \\"Liuthar group\\", unlike other schools in Ottonian art, departs further from rather than returning to classical traditions; it \\"carried transcendentalism to an extreme\\", with \\"marked schematization of the forms and colours\\", \\"flattened form, conceptualized draperies and expansive gesture\\".Beckwith, 104, 102 Backgrounds are often composed of bands of colour with a symbolic rather than naturalistic rationale, the size of figures reflects their importance, and in them \\"emphasis is not so much on movement as in gesture and glance\\", with narrative scenes \\"presented as a quasi-liturgical act, dialogues of divinity\\".Beckwith, 108‚Äì110, both quoted The group were produced perhaps from the 990s to 1015 or later, and major manuscripts include the Munich Gospels of Otto III, the Bamberg Apocalypse and a volume of biblical commentary there, and the Pericopes of Henry II, the best known and most extreme of the group, where \\"the figure-style has become more monumental, more rarified and sublime, at the same time thin in density, insubstantial, mere silhouettes of colour against a shimmering void\\".Beckwith, 112 The group introduced the background of solid gold to Western illumination.

Decorated initial T from Drogo's personal sacramentary. The Drogo Sacramentary (Paris, Biblioth√®que Nationale de France, MS lat. 9428) is a Carolingian illuminated manuscript on vellum from 850 AD, one of the monuments of Carolingian book illumination. It is a sacramentary, a book containing all the prayers spoken by the officiating priest during the course of the year. The sacramentary was written and painted for the personal use of Charlemagne's son Drogo, Bishop of Metz. Metz was an important bishopric: Charles the Bald was crowned in the Basilica, and there Louis the Pious and his illegitimate half-brother Drogo the Bishop are buried. In 843 Metz became the capital of the kingdom of Lotharingia, and several diets and councils were held there. Drogo's position enabled him to be one of the great patrons of 9th-century arts. He embellished his cathedral in Metz with works which rank among the highlights of Carolingian art in beauty and preciousness. Among them are three surviving manuscripts from the court school, of which the Drogo Sacramentary is the most mature and most accomplished. This sacramentary is not the product of a monastic scriptorium but reveals an origin in a court school. It contains only those liturgical sections that the bishop spoke. An example of the individual character of its iconography is the initial O for Palm Sunday prayers, which contains a Crucifixion of a new iconographic type, one that would be called christus patiens rather than the triumphant Christ on the cross (christus triumphans) that had been the norm. In the image, the dead and tortured body of Christ spouts water and blood, which are collected by a female figure recognizable as Ecclesia, the Church, in a chalice, that would become entangled with the Holy Grail legend in the future. The Serpent entwines the base of the cross and figures representing the Sun and Moon witness the event from above. The manuscript's style, too, is considered to show the patron's influence, in an unusually unified work of a small group of artists working in close cooperation. It is 264 mm by 214 mm and has 130 folios. It is lavishly illuminated. External links *Facsimile volume, Adeva, Vienna *Adam H.

universe is a cosmological solution to the Einstein field equations of general relativity, named after Willem de Sitter. It models the universe as spatially flat and neglects ordinary matter, so the dynamics of the universe are dominated by the cosmological constant, thought to correspond to dark energy in our universe or the inflaton field in the early universe. According to the models of inflation and current observations of the accelerating universe, the concordance models of physical cosmology are converging on a consistent model where our universe was best described as a de Sitter universe at about a time t = 10^{-33} seconds after the fiducial Big Bang singularity, and far into the future. Mathematical expression A de Sitter universe has no ordinary matter content but with a positive cosmological constant (\\\\Lambda) that sets the expansion rate, H. A larger cosmological constant leads to a larger expansion rate: :H \\\\propto \\\\sqrt{\\\\Lambda} , where the constants of proportionality depend on conventions. Evolution of the de Sitter universe (dark blue, top curve) compared to other models. It is common to describe a patch of this solution as an expanding universe of the FLRW form where the scale factor is given by :a(t) = e^{Ht} , where the constant H is the Hubble expansion rate and t is time. As in all FLRW spaces, a(t), the scale factor, describes the expansion of physical spatial distances. Unique to universes described by the FLRW metric, a de Sitter universe has a Hubble Law that is not only consistent through all space, but also through all time (since the deceleration parameter is q=-1), thus satisfying the perfect cosmological principle that assumes isotropy and homogeneity throughout space and time. There are ways to cast de Sitter space with static coordinates (see de Sitter space), so unlike other FLRW models, de Sitter space can be thought of as a static solution to Einstein's equations even though the geodesics followed by observers necessarily diverge as expected from the expansion of physical spatial dimensions. As a model for the universe, de Sitter's solution was not considered viable for the observed universe until models for inflation and dark energy were developed. Before then, it was assumed that the Big Bang implied only an acceptance of the weaker cosmological principle, which holds that isotropy and homogeneity apply spatially but not temporally. Potential for the Universe Because our Universe entered the Dark Energy Dominated Era about five billion years ago, our universe is probably approaching a de Sitter universe in the infinite future. If the current acceleration of our universe is due to a cosmological constant then as the universe continues to expand all of the matter and radiation will be diluted. Eventually there will be almost nothing left but the vacuum energy, tiny thermal fluctuations, quantum fluctuations and our universe will have become a de Sitter universe. Relative expansion The exponential expansion of the scale factor means that the physical distance between any two non-accelerating observers will eventually be growing faster than the speed of light. At this point those two observers will no longer be able to make contact. Therefore, any observer in a de Sitter universe would see event horizons beyond which that observer can never see nor learn any information. If our universe is approaching a de Sitter universe then eventually we will not be able to observe any galaxies other than our own Milky Way (and any others in the gravitationally bound Local Group, assuming they were to somehow survive to that time without merging). Modelling cosmic inflation Another application of de Sitter space is in the early universe during cosmic inflation. Many inflationary models are approximately de Sitter space and can be modelled by giving the Hubble parameter a mild time dependence. For simplicity, some calculations involving inflation in the early universe can be performed in de Sitter space rather than a more realistic inflationary universe. By using the de Sitter universe instead, where the expansion is truly exponential, there are many simplifications.

It was first published on 6 June 1981 as a one-off supplement in the Sounds newspaper. Named after the onomatopoeic word that derives from the sound made when playing a power chord on a distorted electric guitar, Kerrang! was initially devoted to the new wave of British heavy metal and the rise of hard rock acts. In the early 2000s it became the best-selling British music weekly. History Kerrang! was founded in 1981. The magazine commenced publication on 6 June 1981 and was edited by Geoff Barton, initially as a one-time supplement in the Sounds newspaper, which focused on the new wave of British heavy metal phenomenon and on the rise of other hard rock acts. Angus Young of AC/DC appeared on Kerrang!s first cover. Launched as a monthly magazine, Kerrang! began to appear on a fortnightly basis later, and in 1987 it went weekly. The original owner was United Newspapers who then sold it to EMAP in 1991. During the 1980s and early 1990s the magazine placed many thrash and glam metal acts on the cover (like M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Slayer, Bon Jovi, Metallica, Poison, and Venom) but later discarded them when grunge acts such as Nirvana rose to fame. Readers often criticise the magazine for repeating this process every time a new musical subgenre becomes trendy. The term \\"thrash metal\\" was first coined in the music press by Kerrang! journalist Malcolm Dome, in reference to the Anthrax song \\"Metal Thrashing Mad\\".Kerrang!' ', issue 62, page 8,23 February 1984 Prior to this Metallica's James Hetfield had referred to their sound as \\"power metal\\". Kerrang!s popularity rose again with the hiring of editor Paul Rees circa 2000 when the nu metal genre, featuring bands including Limp Bizkit and Slipknot, was becoming more popular. Rees went on to edit Q magazine and former Kerrang! reviews editor Ashley Bird was appointed editor from 2003 to 2005. Following his departure, Paul Brannigan took over as editor in May 2005. With the emergence of emo and metalcore during the mid to late-2000s, Kerrang! began to heavily feature this musical trend. The revamp was not welcomed by all readers and many complaints were received about Kerrang!s sudden emphasis on emo and metalcore music. However, following this change, Brannigan took the magazine into its most commercially successful period with a record ever ABC for the title of 80,186 copies. In 2008, EMAP sold its consumer magazines to Bauer Media Group. Brannigan left Kerrang! in 2009 and Nichola Browne was appointed editor. She later stepped down in April 2011. Former NME features editor and GamesMaster deputy editor James McMahon was appointed as editor on 6 June 2011. In April 2017, Kerrang! magazine, its website, and the K! Awards were purchased by Mixmag Media, publisher of dance monthly Mixmag, along with assets related to defunct style magazine The Face. Mixmag has since formed parent company Wasted Talent, which relaunched Kerrang! as a digital-first title, while continuing to publish a weekly print edition. Former Editor-in-Chief Phil Alexander was appointed Global Creative Director on 3 August 2017. Bauer retained ownership of Kerrang! Radio and the Box Plus Network will continue to operate Kerrang! TV as before. The magazine received a logo change in mid-2017 before receiving a complete redesign during 2018. This change saw several of the magazine's long-running features dropped, including the Ultimate Rockstar Test, while new features were added in their place. =International editions= Emap launched Kerrang! Australia in the late 1990s. Unlike its weekly counterpart in the UK, the Australian edition was published monthly due to stiff competition from free local music publications. Kerrang! is also published in Spanish and German. Kerrang announced its aim to expand into the US in March 2018. In March 2018, following a magazine redesign, Kerrang! announced it would be expanding to the United States, with an office in New York run by Ethan Fixell. The goal would be to generate US-centric content, events, and brand partnerships. Website Kerrang!'s website, www.kerrang.com, was launched in summer 2001 by Dan Silver. Kerrang!'s parent company Emap acquired the domain name from a Norwegian cybersquatter by the name of Steingram Stegane for a token sum of ¬£666. Kerrang!'s website features news and features on both contemporary and classic rock bands, as well as previewing upcoming events. The website hosts Kerrang!'s online shop, podcasts, message board, TV and radio segments ensuring more opportunities to sell associated merchandise and products. In 2001, Kerrang! launched its own online forum with the \\"rants and raves\\" section taking up most of the traffic. Though initially extremely popular, the number of users began to peter out around 2005 with the number of people online dropping to as low as 10 when previously it had been closer to the 100 figure. According to Alexa www.kerrang.com is ranked 83,545th globally, and 33,532nd in the U.S. Kerrang! Awards Since 1993, the magazine has held an annual awards ceremony to mark the most successful bands in the interests of their readers. The awards became one of Britain's most recognised events by the now defunct Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums, often listing some of the winners in their annual round-up of the previous year. The event is presented by major music celebrities, with many others outside the industry who attend the event. After a year hiatus, the Awards were relaunched in 2018, with notable guests that included Johnny Depp, Joe Perry, Tony Iommi, Corey Taylor, and Dave Grohl, among others. Kerrang! Radio In 2000, EMAP launched Kerrang! as a digital radio station, across the United Kingdom. This was principally a 'jukebox' station, playing a back-to- back sequence of rock and alternative music. On 10 June 2004, Kerrang! 105.2 was launched as a regional radio station in Birmingham with an advertising campaign by London-based creative agency ODD. The radio had a number of specialist programmes dedicated to the many subgenres of rock music. The radio output included interviews with those affecting popular culture and society as well as those involved with music. It stopped broadcasting on FM as of 14 June 2013 and once again became a digital station, with listeners able to tune in on DAB or the Kerrang! Radio app. With this broadcasting change came a move in Kerrang! Radio's offices from Birmingham to London. Absolute Radio is now broadcasting on its FM frequency. Kerrang! TV In 2001 EMAP launched Kerrang! TV. As with the radio station, the television channel covers the more mainstream side of the rock music as well as classic rock bands including Aerosmith and AC/DC, and classic heavy metal bands such as Guns N' Roses and Metallica. Kerrang! TV, along with its The Box Plus Network sister channels, is now fully owned by Channel Four Television Corporation. Kerrang! Tour The Kerrang! Tour ran from 2006 to 2017. The line-up for each year was usually announced in October of the previous year and was held throughout January and February of the following year. Relentless Energy Drink sponsored the Kerrang! Tour for several years. It is currently unknown if the tour will ever be revived. *2006, featured Bullet for My Valentine, Hawthorne Heights, Still Remains and Aiden. *2007, featured Biffy Clyro, The Bronx, The Audition and I Am Ghost. *2008, featured Coheed and Cambria, Madina Lake, Fightstar and Circa Survive. *2009, sponsored by Relentless Energy Drink from this year; featured Mindless Self Indulgence, Dir En Grey, Bring Me the Horizon, Black Tide and In Case of Fire. *2010, featured All Time Low, The Blackout, Young Guns and My Passion. Jettblack were added for two dates at the London Roundhouse at the end of the tour. *2011, featured Good Charlotte, Four Year Strong, Framing Hanley and The Wonder Years. *2012. The tour lasted from 5 to 17 February. It featured New Found Glory, Sum 41, letlive. and While She Sleeps. On 20 January 2012 it was revealed that Sum 41 had been unfortunately forced to pull out due to frontman Deryck Whibley who had suffered a back injury and was not well enough to perform for the duration of the tour, they were replaced by The Blackout who had previously played on the 2010 tour. *2013, featured Black Veil Brides, Chiodos, Tonight Alive and Fearless Vampire Killers. It was an 11-date tour which ran from 3‚Äì15 February, with the 6th and 11th being days off. William Control was a guest DJ and also appeared alongside Black Veil Brides on 2 songs; Shadows Die and In the End. *2014, featured Limp Bizkit, Crossfaith, Nekrogoblikon and Baby Godzilla. *2015, featured Don Broco, We Are the in Crowd, Bury Tomorrow, Beartooth and Young Guns. *2016. On 29 September the headliner for the eleventh Kerrang! tour was revealed to be Sum 41. In an interview with Kerrang, frontman Deryck Whibley stated that \\"After a three- year break, we're honoured that our first tour back is the Kerrang!\\" The tour featured Sum 41, Roam, Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes and Biters. *2017, featured The Amity Affliction, Boston Manor, Vukovi, and Casey. The K! Pit The year after the final Kerrang! Tour, Kerrang! launched a new gig concept known as 'The K! Pit', where the magazine promotes a free gig for a popular band in a tiny London venue. Fans gain access by applying for tickets online and being selected at random in a competition-style draw. Artists featured so far include Parkway Drive, Mastodon, Fever 333, and Neck Deep, the latter performance coinciding with the 2018 Kerrang! Awards where Neck Deep would win 'Best Song'. The brand has since also launched the series in Brooklyn, New York, featuring artists such as Sum 41, Baroness, Knocked Loose, Daughters, Fit For An Autopsy. Performances are also streamed on the Kerrang! Facebook page before being uploaded to YouTube. The Official Kerrang! Rock Chart In March 2012, Kerrang! announced a new weekly rock singles chart for the UK based on upon airplay across Kerrang Radio, Kerrang TV, and specialist rock radio stations, as well as sales figures from the Official Charts Company. As of 2019, the chart continues to be printed in the magazine every week, contains twenty tracks, and often features accompanying facts or artist quotes.

The task force was made up of several separate task groups, each typically built around three to four aircraft carriers and their supporting vessels. The support vessels were screening destroyers, cruisers, and the newly built fast battleships.Taylor p. 170  Carrier-based naval warfare  With the arrival of the fleet carriers the primary striking power of the navy was no longer in its battleship force, but with the aircraft that could be brought to battle by the carriers. The means by which the US Navy operated these carriers was developed principally by Admiral Marc Mitscher. Mitscher determined that the best defense for a carrier was its own air groups, and that carriers were more easily defended if they operated together in groups, with supporting ships along with them to aid in air defense, anti-submarine defense, and rescue of downed airmen. Said Mitscher: \\"The ideal composition of a fast-carrier task force is four carriers, six to eight support vessels and not less than 18 destroyers, preferably 24. More than four carriers in a task group cannot be advantageously used due to the amount of air room required. Less than four carriers requires an uneconomical use of support ships and screening vessels.\\" The ships of each task group sailed in a circle formation centered on the carriers. The supporting ships sailed relatively close by, and added their anti-aircraft fire to that of the carriers to help ward off attacking aircraft. When under attack by torpedo aircraft, the task group would turn toward the oncoming aircraft to limit attack angles. Other than this measure, the carriers in the task group would not take evasive action from their attackers. This was in marked contrast with the Imperial Japanese Navy, but the choice made for more stable platforms for the anti-aircraft fire of all the ships in the task group and allowed the ships in the group to sail more closely together. The primary defense of the group against air attack was the group's own fighter cover.  Admirals  Admiral Marc Mitscher aboard the USS Lexington The individual primarily responsible for the development and operations of the task force was Admiral Mitscher.Taylor p. 304Reynolds p. The overall command of the task force alternated between two very different admirals: Raymond Spruance and William \\"Bull\\" Halsey. Spruance was calculating and cautious, while Halsey was more aggressive and known for taking risks. Most higher-ranking officers preferred to serve under Spruance; most common sailors were proud to serve under Halsey. Their commander was Admiral Chester Nimitz. When the force was part of Admiral Spruance's Fifth Fleet, the carrier task force was commanded by Mitscher and bore the designation Task Force (TF) 58. When led by Admiral Halsey as part of the Third Fleet, the carrier force was commanded by Vice Admiral John S. McCain Sr. and its designation was Task Force (TF) 38. Planning for upcoming operations was completed when each admiral and his staff rotated out of active command. This allowed the Navy to perform at a higher operational tempo, while giving the Japanese the general impression of naval assets greater than what were actually available.[5]  Fast carriers in action  As Task Force 58, moving under the cover of a combat air patrol, 1944 The Fast Carrier Task Force took part in all the US Navy's battles in the Pacific during the last two years of the war. The task groups could operate independently or combine with the others as needs dictated. Raids against island strong points such as Iwo Jima or Chichi Jima might be undertaken by one or two task groups, but when a major operation was underway the task force would concentrate all four groups together. Each group would remain distinct but operate in close proximity to the other groups to provide the task force with maximum protection and maximum striking power. The Fast Carrier Task Force worked in conjunction with the other two major components of the Pacific Fleet: the Amphibious Force, which was much larger overall and which carried and provided direct support to the Marine forces, and the Service Squadrons of hundreds of support vessels which resupplied and maintained the fleet. The fleet and task group designation changed when the command of the fleet changed hands. When under the umbrella of Fifth Fleet, the invasion force was called the Fifth Amphibious Force. When Halsey had command of the fleet, Third Amphibious Force was the designation. By the time of the Battle of Iwo Jima in early 1945, the Task Force included eighteen aircraft carriers, eight battleships and two Alaska-class large cruisers, along with numerous cruisers and destroyers. TF 58 alone commanded more firepower than any navy in history.Willmott p. 180 The original TF 38 came into existence in August 1943, built around , and under the command of Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman. TF 58 was created on 6 January 1944 with Rear Admiral Marc Mitscher commanding, serving under the fleet command of Admiral Spruance in the Fifth Fleet. TF 38 continued to exist, but as a command structure only. TF 58 proved the success of the Fast Carrier TF concept with Operation Hailstone, a massive naval air squadrons and surface vessels attack on the Japanese ships and airfield at Truk Lagoon on 17‚Äì18 February 1944. As Task Force 38, maneuvering off the Japanese coast, 17 August 1945 With command change from Spruance to Halsey on 26 August 1944, all units changed designations again. Mitscher, who was an aviator from early training and had a masterful command of the airgroups, requested that he retain command of the Fast Carrier Task Force until his replacement, Admiral John McCain, could have proper time to become more familiar with the handling of a carrier task force. King and Nimitz concurred. Admiral Halsey, like Spruance before him, sailed with the Fast Carrier Task Force. The force grew to nine CVs and eight CVLs in preparation for the landings on Leyte. Task Force 38 was composed of four task groups: Task Group 38.1 was commanded by Admiral McCain, with its previous commander, Admiral Joseph \\"Jocko\\" Clark, remaining on as advisor, Task Group 38.2 was under the command of Admiral Gerald Bogan, Task Group 38.3 was led by Admiral Frederick Sherman, and Task Group 38.4 was under the command of Admiral Ralph Davison.Taylor, p. 248 Following the Battle of Leyte Gulf, Mitscher went on shore leave and planning duty, and Vice Admiral McCain took over as commanding officer of TF 38, which continued under Halsey and the Third Fleet. In January 1945 TF 38 raided the South China Sea and attacked Japanese positions in Formosa and Luzon. Ships of Task Group 38.3 operating off Okinawa during May 1945 On 26 January 1945, Halsey and McCain went on shore leave and planning duty, while Spruance and Mitscher returned to their previous commands. Third Fleet became Fifth Fleet, and TF 38 became TF 58. They led the fleet through the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, facing sustained attacks from land-based Japanese kamikaze aircraft. As the Okinawa campaign dragged into its second month, the presence of the carriers was still required to provide close air support to the soldiers on the island as the Army and its Air Corps were not as adept as the Marine Corps at quickly establishing airfields over newly occupied territory. At the end of April, Admiral Nimitz came out to review the situation. After two months operating off the coast of Okinawa in support of Army forces engaged in battle on the island, the command staff was exhausted from the continuous pressure of fending off kamikaze attacks. On his return to Pearl Harbor, he notified Halsey that he would have to take over command from Spruance in thirty days, whether or not the mission was completed. On 28 May 1945, Halsey arrived aboard , his new flagship, whereupon he relieved Spruance, while McCain relieved Mitscher. Spruance and Mitscher returned to Pearl Harbor. Fifth Fleet once again became Third Fleet, and Task Force 58 became Task Force 38. Halsey remained in command until the Japanese surrender ended the war on 2 September 1945.

West Virginia, 129 U.S. 114 (1889), was an important United States Supreme Court case involving the reputable practice of physicians and state laws in the late 19th century. It was a direct challenge to West Virginia having passed \\"the nation's first genuinely restrictive physician licensing law in the early 1880s.\\" The Case Frank Dent was a physician who practiced with his father and grandfather in Newburg, West Virginia. Frank had only apprenticed with his father and practiced for six years when West Virginia passed its Board of Health Act in 1881 requiring either a diploma from a reputable medical college, a certificate showing ten years' practice, or successful passing of a state-administered exam. In 1882 Dent submitted a diploma from the American Eclectic Medical College in Cincinnati, which the Board of Health determined to be a fraudulent eclectic institution. Dent continued practicing and the Board's President, James Reeves, had Dent arrested. Frank Dent turned to his cousin Marmaduke H. Dent, Grafton West Virgnia attorney and first graduate of the University of West Virginia for his defense. At his trial in 1883 Frank Dent was found guilty of practicing without a medical license. Marmaduke Dent appealed the decision to the West Virginia Supreme Court on the grounds that the state could not interfere with a citizen's right to practice a lawful trade. The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals heard Dent's case in 1884 and rejected Marmaduke's arguments. M.H. Dent then filed an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1885 claiming a violation of his cousin's rights under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court had a considerable backlog and did not hear the case until 1889.https://www.loc.gov/item/usrep129114/ The Decision Justice Stephen J. Field delivered the Court's unanimous opinion on January 14, 1889, which upheld the West Virginia statute. Field noted that each citizen had a right to follow any lawful calling, subject to natural restraints such as age, sex, etc., as well as state restrictions, as long as those state restrictions were reasonable. In addition, the Court ruled that medicine, because of the careful nature of its training, the large knowledge of the human body required of doctors, and nature of life-and-death circumstances with which doctors dealt, reliance needed to be placed on the assurance of a license. Certain circumstances might prompt states to exclude people without licenses from practicing medicine.https://www.loc.gov/item/usrep129114/ Aftermath Later, the Court would extend its decision in the case Hawker v. New York, 170 U.S. 189 (1898) when it ruled that character was also an important qualification for doctors wishing to obtain a license. As in any Supreme Court case, Dent has been cited numerous times, particularly in defining the legitimate role of state regulation versus Constitutional prohibitions on Bills of Attainder.

Etymology and usage The word approximation is derived from Latin approximatus, from proximus meaning very near and the prefix ap- (ad- before p) meaning to.The Concise Oxford Dictionary, Eighth edition 1990, Words like approximate, approximately and approximation are used especially in technical or scientific contexts. In everyday English, words such as roughly or around are used with a similar meaning.Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, Pearson Education Ltd 2009, It is often found abbreviated as approx. The term can be applied to various properties (e.g., value, quantity, image, description) that are nearly, but not exactly correct; similar, but not exactly the same (e.g., the approximate time was 10 o'clock). Although approximation is most often applied to numbers, it is also frequently applied to such things as mathematical functions, shapes, and physical laws. In science, approximation can refer to using a simpler process or model when the correct model is difficult to use. An approximate model is used to make calculations easier. Approximations might also be used if incomplete information prevents use of exact representations. The type of approximation used depends on the available information, the degree of accuracy required, the sensitivity of the problem to this data, and the savings (usually in time and effort) that can be achieved by approximation.  Mathematics  Approximation theory is a branch of mathematics, a quantitative part of functional analysis. Diophantine approximation deals with approximations of real numbers by rational numbers. Approximation usually occurs when an exact form or an exact numerical number is unknown or difficult to obtain. However some known form may exist and may be able to represent the real form so that no significant deviation can be found. It also is used when a number is not rational, such as the number œÄ, which often is shortened to 3.14159, or to 1.414. Numerical approximations sometimes result from using a small number of significant digits. Calculations are likely to involve rounding errors leading to approximation. Log tables, slide rules and calculators produce approximate answers to all but the simplest calculations. The results of computer calculations are normally an approximation expressed in a limited number of significant digits, although they can be programmed to produce more precise results. Approximation can occur when a decimal number cannot be expressed in a finite number of binary digits. Related to approximation of functions is the asymptotic value of a function, i.e. the value as one or more of a function's parameters becomes arbitrarily large. For example, the sum (k/2)+(k/4)+(k/8)+...(k/2^n) is asymptotically equal to k. Unfortunately no consistent notation is used throughout mathematics and some texts will use ‚âà to mean approximately equal and ~ to mean asymptotically equal whereas other texts use the symbols the other way around. As another example, in order to accelerate the convergence rate of evolutionary algorithms, fitness approximation‚Äîthat leads to build model of the fitness function to choose smart search steps‚Äîis a good solution.  Science  Approximation arises naturally in scientific experiments. The predictions of a scientific theory can differ from actual measurements. This can be because there are factors in the real situation that are not included in the theory. For example, simple calculations may not include the effect of air resistance. Under these circumstances, the theory is an approximation to reality. Differences may also arise because of limitations in the measuring technique. In this case, the measurement is an approximation to the actual value. The history of science shows that earlier theories and laws can be approximations to some deeper set of laws. Under the correspondence principle, a new scientific theory should reproduce the results of older, well-established, theories in those domains where the old theories work.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica The old theory becomes an approximation to the new theory. Some problems in physics are too complex to solve by direct analysis, or progress could be limited by available analytical tools. Thus, even when the exact representation is known, an approximation may yield a sufficiently accurate solution while reducing the complexity of the problem significantly. Physicists often approximate the shape of the Earth as a sphere even though more accurate representations are possible, because many physical characteristics (e.g., gravity) are much easier to calculate for a sphere than for other shapes. Approximation is also used to analyze the motion of several planets orbiting a star. This is extremely difficult due to the complex interactions of the planets' gravitational effects on each other.The three body problem An approximate solution is effected by performing iterations. In the first iteration, the planets' gravitational interactions are ignored, and the star is assumed to be fixed. If a more precise solution is desired, another iteration is then performed, using the positions and motions of the planets as identified in the first iteration, but adding a first-order gravity interaction from each planet on the others. This process may be repeated until a satisfactorily precise solution is obtained. The use of perturbations to correct for the errors can yield more accurate solutions. Simulations of the motions of the planets and the star also yields more accurate solutions. The most common versions of philosophy of science accept that empirical measurements are always approximations‚Äîthey do not perfectly represent what is being measured. The error-tolerance property of several applications (e.g., graphics applications) allows use of approximation (e.g., lowering the precision of numerical computations) to improve performance and energy efficiency. This approach of using deliberate, controlled approximation for achieving various optimizations is referred to as approximate computing.

Jean Monnet has been called \\"The Father of Europe\\" by those who see his innovative and pioneering efforts in the 1950s as the key to establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, the predecessor of today's European Union. Although Monnet was never elected to public office, he worked behind the scenes of American and European governments as a well-connected \\"pragmatic internationalist\\".Times obituary He was the first-ever individual to be bestowed Honorary Citizenship of Europe in 1976, and remained the only one for a generation until Helmut Kohl received the same distinction in 1998. Early years Monnet was born in Cognac, a commune in the department of Charente in France, into a family of cognac merchants. According to Jacques-Ren√© Rabier, the values of laicism and republicanism as well as a strong Catholic tradition co-existed in Monnet's family. His mother was deeply religious and his sister Marie-Louise was a founder of the French branch of Action Catholique, to which Monnet contributed financially, she would later introduce her brother to Pope Paul VI. At the age of sixteen, Monnet abandoned his university entrance examinations part way through and moved to the United Kingdom, where he spent several years in London learning business with Mr Chaplin, an agent of his father's company. Subsequently, he travelled widely ‚Äì to Scandinavia, Russia, Egypt, Canada, and the United States ‚Äì for the family business. World War I Monnet firmly believed that the only path to an Allied victory lay in combining the war efforts of Britain and France, and he reflected on a concept that would coordinate war resources. In 1914, a friend of the family, Fernand Benon, arranged for young Monnet to meet French Premier Ren√© Viviani in Bordeaux to talk about this issue; Monnet managed to convince the French government to agree with him, in principle. However, during the first two years of the war, Monnet did not have much success pressing for a better organization of the allied economic cooperation. It was not until two years later that stronger combines like the Wheat Executive (end of 1916) and the Allied Maritime Transport Council (end of 1917) were set into motion, adding to the overall war effort. Inter-war years Advertisement for Monnet Cognac, 1927 At the Paris Peace Conference, Monnet was an assistant to the French minister of commerce and industry, √âtienne Cl√©mentel, who proposed a \\"new economic order\\" based on European cooperation. The scheme was officially rejected by the Allies in April 1919.MacMillan, Margaret. \\"Paris 1919\\". Random House, 2002, p. 183 Due to his contributions to the war effort, Monnet, at the age of thirty-one, was named Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations by French premier Georges Clemenceau and British statesman Arthur Balfour, upon the League's creation in 1919. Soon disillusioned with the League because of its laborious and unanimous decision-making processes, Monnet resigned in 1923 and devoted himself to managing the cognac family business, which was experiencing difficulties. In 1925, Monnet moved to America to accept a partnership in Blair & Co., a New York bank which merged with Bank of America in 1929, forming Bancamerica-Blair Corporation which was owned by Transamerica Corporation. He returned to international politics and, as an international financier, proved to be instrumental to the economic recovery of several Central and Eastern Europe nations. He helped stabilise the Polish z≈Çoty in 1927 and the Romanian leu in 1928. In November 1932, the Chinese Minister of Finance invited Jean Monnet to act as chairman of an east‚Äìwest non-political committee in China for the development of the Chinese economy where he lived until 1936. During his time in China, Monnet's task of partnering Chinese capital with foreign companies led to the formal inauguration of the Chinese Development Finance Corporation (CDFC) as well as the reorganization of the Chinese railroads. In 1935, when Monnet was still in Shanghai, he became a business partner of George Murnane (a former colleague of Monnet at Transamerica) in Monnet, Murnane & Co. Murnane was connected to the Wallenberg family in Sweden, the Bosch family in Germany, the Solvays and Bo√´ls in Belgium, and John Foster Dulles, Andr√© Meyer, and the Rockefeller family in the United States. He was considered among the most connected persons of his time.2003, Charles D. Ellis, James R.

In December 1939, Monnet was sent to London to oversee the collectivization of the British and French war industries. In his memoirs, Monnet claims that his influence inspired Charles de Gaulle and Winston Churchill to agree on an Anglo-French union, ostensibly in an attempt to rival the alliance between Germany and Italy, an event, however, not mentioned in de Gaulle's or Churchill's memoirs on the war. Willard Hotel where Monnet had his wartime office in Washington DC De Gaulle dined with Monnet on his first evening in Britain after his flight with Winston Churchill's envoy Edward Spears (17 June).Lacouture 1991, pp219-23 Monnet broke with de Gaulle on 23 June, as he thought the general's appeal was \\"too personal\\" and that de Gaulle had broken \\"too far\\" with the collaborationist P√©tain government. Monnet believed that French opinion would not rally to a man who was seen to be operating from British soil. He claimed to have shared his concerns about de Gaulle with the Foreign Office mandarins Alexander Cadogan and Robert Vansittart, and Spears. In August 1940, Monnet resigned as head of the Inter-Allied CommissionLacouture 1991, pp236-7 and was sent to the United States by the British Government, as a member of the British Supply Council, to ask for rapid and massive increases in the flow of American weapons so Britain could turn the tide against Germany. Soon after his arrival in Washington, D.C., he became an advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Convinced that America could serve as \\"the great arsenal of democracy\\", he persuaded the President to launch a massive arms production program, both as an economic stimulus and to supply the Allies with military resources. Unlike De Gaulle, Monnet was popular with the Americans and the English. A co-worker of his claims that sometimes he would help Churchill to write a message to Roosevelt and then on the next day help Roosevelt to compose the response. According to Edward R. Kantowicz, Monnet was impressed by the American organizational energy and saw cooperation with the new superpower as Europe's only chance to reorganize and recover itself. In 1941, Roosevelt, with Churchill's agreement, launched the Victory Program, which represented the involvement of the United States in the war effort. After the war, British economist John Maynard Keynes stated that Monnet, through his coordination work, had probably shortened World War II by a year. While in Washington, Monnet and his family lived in a comfortable house built in 1934 at 2415 Foxhall Road NW, which was later home to Adlai Stevenson III and James Baker. He worked from an office of the British Mission at the Willard Hotel. In 1943, Monnet became a member of the National Liberation Committee, De Gaulle's French government-in-exile, stationed in Algiers, being designated Commissaire √† l'Armement (Minister of Armaments). During a meeting on 5 August of that year, Monnet declared to the Committee: > There will be no peace in Europe if the states are reconstituted on the > basis of national sovereignty... The countries of Europe are too small to > guarantee their peoples the necessary prosperity and social development. The > European states must constitute themselves into a federation... The Monnet Plan Plaque at 18, rue de Martignac, the office of the Plan Following World War II, France was in severe need of reconstruction and completely dependent on coal from Germany's main remaining coal-mining areas, the Ruhr and the Saar. (The German coal fields in Upper Silesia had been handed over to Polish administration by the Allies in 1945, see Oder-Neisse line.) In 1945, Monnet proposed the Monnet Plan, also known as the \\"Theory of l'Engrenage\\" (not to be confused with the Schuman plan). It included taking control of the remaining German coal-producing areas and redirecting the production away from the German industry and into the French, thus permanently weakening Germany and raising the French economy considerably above its pre- war levels. The plan was adopted by Charles de Gaulle in early 1946. Later that year, Monnet successfully negotiated the Blum‚ÄìByrnes agreement with the United States, which cleared France from a $2.8 billion debt (mostly World War I loans) and provided the country with an additional low-interest loan of $650 million. In return, France opened its cinemas to American movies. European Coal and Steel Community Monnet visiting Konrad Adenauer in Bonn, December 1953 In 1947 France removed the Saar from Germany, with U.S. support, and turned it into the Saar Protectorate, which was essentially a French vassal state. The area returned to German political administration in 1957 (economic reunification would take many years longer), but France retained the right to mine from its coal mines until 1981. (See: The Europeanisation of the Saarland) Former seat of the ECSC on Place de Metz in Luxembourg, now Banque et Caisse d'√âpargne de l'√âtat The Ruhr Agreement was imposed on the Germans as a condition for permitting them to establish the Federal Republic of Germany.Amos Yoder, \\"The Ruhr Authority and the German Problem\\", The Review of Politics, Vol. 17, No. 3 (July 1955), pp. 345‚Äì358 The IAR controlled production levels, pricing, and the sales markets, thus ensuring that France received a considerable portion of the Ruhr coal production at low prices. When tensions between France and Germany rose over the control of the then vital coal and steel industries, Monnet and his associates conceived the idea of a European Community. On 9 May 1950, with the agreement of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany, French Minister of Foreign Affairs Robert Schuman made a declaration in the name of the French government. This landmark pronouncement, prepared by Monnet for Schuman and known as the Schuman Declaration, proposed integration of the French and German coal and steel industries under joint control, a so-called High Authority, open to the other countries of Europe. Schuman declared: > Through the consolidation of basic production and the institution of a new > High Authority, whose decisions will bind France, Germany and the other > countries that join, this proposal represents the first concrete step > towards a European federation, imperative for the preservation of > peace.Declaration of 9 May 1950 EUROPA ‚Äì The official website of the > European Union The date of the Schuman Declaration, 9 May, has been adopted as Europe Day by the European Union. It is generally viewed as the starting point of development of the Union and its institutions. When Germany agreed to join the European Coal and Steel Community according to the Schuman Plan in 1951, the ongoing dismantling of German industry was halted and some of the restrictions on German industrial output were lifted. West Germany joined the ECSC, alongside Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, while Britain refused, on grounds of national sovereignty. In 1952, Jean Monnet became the first president of the High Authority and with the opening of the common market for coal under the ECSC in 1953, the last civilian production limitations placed on German industry were lifted, and the role of the IAR was taken over by the ECSC. Action Committee for the United States of Europe Plaque at 83, Avenue Foch in Paris, where the Action Committee had its secretariat In 1955, Monnet founded the Action Committee for the United States of Europe in order to revive European construction following the failure of the European Defence Community (EDC). It brought political parties and European trade unions together to become a driving force behind the initiatives which laid the foundation for the European Union as it eventually emerged: first, the European Economic Community (EEC) (1958) (known commonly as the \\"Common Market\\"), which was established by the Treaty of Rome of 1957; later the European Communities (1967) with its corresponding bodies, the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers, British membership of the Communities (1973), the European Council (1974), the European Monetary System (1979), and a directly elected European Parliament (1979). This process reflected Monnet's belief in a gradualist approach for constructing European unity. Monnet resigned and ended the Committee's activity on 9 May 1975, the 25th anniversary of the Schuman Declaration. Memoirs Writing about his life and the principles which drove his action was a longstanding project which Monnet delayed for years as he gave higher priority to his other projects. In the early 1970s, Fran√ßois Fontaine was instrumental in bringing the endeavor to fruition and drafted much of the text, even as Monnet retained ultimate control. The Memoirs were published by Fayard in 1976, and an English translation by Richard Mayne by Doubleday in 1978. Private life In August 1929, during a dinner party in Paris, the 41-year-old Monnet met 22-year-old Italian painter Silvia Giannini (17 August 1907 ‚Äì 22 August 1982)https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/28/obituaries/silvia- monnet.htmlhttp://gw.geneanet.org/garric?lang=fr&p;=silvia&n;=de+bondinihttp://www.uniset.ca/naty/maternity/monnet.htm who had recently married Francisco Giannini, an employee of Monnet when he was a representative in Italy. In April 1931, Silvia gave birth to a daughter, Anna, whose legal father was Giannini. Since divorce wasn't allowed in most European countries, Silvia and Jean Monnet met in Moscow, as it was possible there to obtain citizenship and residence qualifications rapidly, and to divorce and remarry at once. In 1934, he returned from China via the Trans- Siberian railway, she from Switzerland. He arranged for Silvia to obtain Soviet citizenship; she immediately divorced her husband and married Jean Monnet. The idea for the Moscow marriage came from Dr. Ludwik Rajchman, whom Monnet had met during his time at the League of Nations (Rajchman was connected to the Soviet Ambassador to China, Dmitrij Bogomo≈Çow). It seems that the American and French ambassadors in Moscow, William Bullitt and Charles Alphand, also played a role. The custody of Anna was a problem; in 1935 Silvia took refuge with Anna in the Soviet consulate in Shanghai, where they were living at the time because Francisco Giannini was trying to obtain custody of the child. The legal battle was decided in favour of Silvia in 1937 in New York, but the ruling wasn't recognized by some other countries. In 1941 Monnet and Silvia had another daughter, Marianne. The Monnet family returned to France in 1945 and, after the death of Francisco Giannini in 1974, the couple married canonically in the cathedral of Lourdes. Silvia Monnet was very important to her husband throughout their forty-five years of marriage, according to Louis Joxe, Monnet \\"would spend hours writing to his wife, whose opinion mattered more to him than that of anyone else\\". Death and Legacy Tomb in the Panth√©on. From left to right: Jean Moulin, Andr√© Malraux, Simone and Antoine Veil, Monnet, and Ren√© Cassin On 16 March 1979, Jean Monnet died at the age of 90 in his home in Houjarray, Bazoches-sur-Guyonne. =Burial= Monnet was initially buried at the local cemetery of Bazoches-sur-Guyonne. In 1988, on the hundredth anniversary of his birth, he was reburied in the Panth√©on in Paris in a ceremony attended by numerous European heads of state and government. =Honors= German stamp (1977) In 1953 Monnet was awarded the Karlspreis by the city of Aachen in recognition of his achievements. He received numerous other prizes and honorary degrees, including Doctor Honoris Causa from the universities of Cambridge (8 June 1961), Dartmouth (11 June 1961), Yale (12 June 1961), and Oxford (26 June 1963). On 6 December 1963, he was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with Special Distinction, by United States President Lyndon Johnson. The decision had been made by President Kennedy before his assassination. In 1972, Queen Elizabeth II made him an honorary Companion of Honour. He was the first to be bestowed Honorary Citizen of Europe by the European Council of the European Union, for extraordinary work to promote European cooperation on 2 April 1976. Following this, he became the first person then living to be pictured on a Federal Republic of Germany stamp who was not a German head of state. Shortly after his death, he was named patron of the 1980‚Äì1981 academic year at the College of Europe.College of Europe, \\"Promotions and Patrons\\" =Jean Monnet House at Houjarray= Jean Monnet House, 2012 Plaque at the Jean Monnet House The Jean Monnet House is located in Houjarray, a hamlet of Bazoches-sur-Guyonne, Yvelines, 80 kilometres (50 miles) outside Paris. This old farm became Jean Monnet's property in 1945, upon his return to France. It was there that Jean Monnet and his advisors, in the last days of April 1950, drew up the historic declaration that Robert Schuman used to address Europe on 9 May 1950, proposing the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community. In the house, Robert Schuman, Walter Hallstein, Paul-Henri Spaak, Konrad Adenauer, Ren√© Pleven, Helmut Schmidt, and many others exchanged their views with Jean Monnet on Europe's common future. On Sundays, he had friends passing by come to his house; among them were Dwight Eisenhower, George Ball, and Edward Heath. Monnet liked fireside conversations with journalists such as Walter Lippman, Hubert Beuve-M√©ry, or his neighbour Pierre Viansson-Pont√©. This house was also where Jean Monnet died on 16 March 1979. The European Parliament acquired the house in 1982 and entrusted its restoration, management, and organization to the Jean Monnet Association. A multimedia conference room was added in 2000. The Jean Monnet Association organizes about 250 conferences on European history and current events each year.http://www.ajmonnet.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=75&Itemid;=21‚ü®=en =Jean Monnet Foundation for Europe= Jean Monnet Foundation for Europe in Lausanne The Jean Monnet Foundation for Europe in Lausanne supports initiatives dedicated to the construction of European unity. Its origins date from a meeting between Jean Monnet and Henri Rieben in 1955. It is located on the campus of the University of Lausanne and houses the personal archives of Jean Monnet as well as those of Robert Schuman, Robert Marjolin, Fran√ßois Fontaine, Jacques Van Helmont, Paolo Emilio Taviani, Robert Triffin, and the Earl of Perth. =Other places and institutions named after Jean Monnet= Jean-Monnet Bridge over the Moselle in Metz Lyc√©e Jean-Monnet in Yzeure Lyc√©e Fran√ßais Jean-Monnet in Brussels The now demolished first Jean Monnet building, in Luxembourg.

Tribute to the Founding Fathers of Europe monumnent in front of Robert Schuman's house in Scy-Chazelles: Alcide de Gasperi, Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet and Konrad Adenauer. Numerous streets, squares, and avenues have been named after Jean Monnet in France and elsewhere in Europe, including the Place Jean-Monnet in the 16th arrondissement of Paris and the Jean-Monnet-Strasse in the Moabit neighborhood of Berlin. Many educational institutions are also named after him, including numerous Lyc√©es and Jean Monnet University (Universit√© Jean Monnet de Saint-√âtienne), situated on two campuses in Saint-√âtienne. Several other European universities honour Monnet and his accomplishments: the University of Limerick, Ireland, has a lecture theatre named after him, and British educational institutions which honour Monnet include the Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence at King's College London, the East Midlands Euro-Centre at Loughborough University, the European Research Institute at the University of Bath,European Research Institute the Jean Monnet Centre at the University of Birmingham, the Jean Monnet European Centre of Excellence at Cambridge, the Jean Monnet European Centre of Excellence at the University of Essex, the Centre for European Union Studies at the University of Hull, the Kent Centre for Europe at the University of Kent,Kent Centre for Europe the Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence, a partnership between the University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Salford, the Jean Monnet Centre at Newcastle University,Jean Monnet Centre the Jean Monnet Centre for European Studies at the University of WalesJean Monnet Centre for European Studies and the Jean Monnet High School in Bucharest, Romania. Named after Monnet, the Jean Monnet building was the principal location of the European Commission's activities in Luxembourg between 1975 and 2016. Its replacement, the Jean Monnet 2 building, will become operational from February 2023. =Jean Monnet Prizes= Several prizes also seek to honour Jean Monnet's life and achievements. The , set up in 1995 by the department of Charente, rewards European authors for books written in, or translated to, French. The Jean Monnet Prize for European Integration, given by EuropeanConstitution.eu, a French association, rewards projects contributing to the promotion of European integration. Several universities and research centres also award prizes named after Jean Monnet. =Jean Monnet Programme and Chairs= The European Union maintains Monnet's memory with the Jean Monnet Activities, under the Erasmus+ programme of the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA). These activities promote knowledge on European integration and European studies on a worldwide scale, especially at the university level, through the Jean Monnet Centres of Excellence, as well as chairs, policy debates, and support to associations. Jean Monnet Actions aim to build bridges between academics, researchers and EU policymakers. There is an emphasis on the study of and research on EU integration and in understanding Europe's place in a globalised world. Jean Monnet Actions are organised and applied for via higher education institutions. Jean Monnet Chairs are teaching posts with a specialisation in European Union studies for university professors or senior lecturers. Jean Monnet Chairs can: * enhance the teaching of EU studies at your institution through the curriculum * conduct, monitor and supervise research on EU matters at all education levels * be a mentor and advisor to the next generation of teachers and researchers * provide expert guidance to future professionals about European matters Jean Monnet Chairs are encouraged to: * publish books within their university press during the grant period. The grant will cover part of the publication and, if need be, part of the translation costs * participate in dissemination and information events in your country and around Europe * organise events (lectures, seminars, workshops, etc.) with policymakers, civil society and schools * network with other academics and institutions supported by Jean Monnet * apply open educational resources, and publish the summaries, content, schedule and expected outcomes of your activities Jean Monnet chairs have been established, for example, at the following universities (alphabetically): In September 2016, Prof. Dr Sebastian Bersick was awarded a Jean Monnet Chair by the European Commission under the Erasmus+ Programme. The funding enables the Ruhr-University Bochum (RUB), the Faculty of East Asian Studies, and the Department of International Political Economy of East Asia to intensify teaching and research activities and to organize new initiatives. =Cinema= In April 2011, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Paris, a new documentary, \\"Jean Monnet: Father of Europe\\" was produced. The documentary includes interviews with colleagues of Monnet such as , Max Kohnstamm and Jacques-Ren√© Rabier, as well as former member of the European Court of Justice David A.O.

This style of dress continued in fashion until the end of the reign of King Edward III (1327-1377).Macklin, Herbert Walter & Page-Phillips, John, (Eds.), 1969, p.69 A wimple is a medieval form of female headdress, formed of a large piece of cloth worn around the neck and chin, and covering the top of the head. Its use developed in early medieval Europe. At many stages of medieval Christian culture it was unseemly for a married woman to show her hair. A wimple might be elaborately starched, and creased and folded in prescribed ways, and later elaborated versions were supported on wire or wicker framing, such as the cornette. Italian women abandoned their head cloths in the 15th century, or replaced them with transparent gauze, and showed their elaborate braids. Both elaborate braiding and elaborately laundered clothes demonstrated status, in that such grooming was being performed by others. Today the wimple is worn by certain nuns who retain a traditional habit. In literature The Wife of Bath and the Prioress are depicted wearing wimples in the Canterbury Tales of Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1343‚Äì1400).

His maternal grandparents were Ercole II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, and Ren√©e of France. Through his maternal grandfather, he was a descendant of Lucrezia Borgia and Pope Alexander VI. In 1576 he founded the Catholic League to prevent the heir, King Henry of Navarre, head of the Huguenot movement, from succeeding to the French throne. A key figure in the French Wars of Religion, he was one of the namesakes of the War of the Three Henrys. A powerful opponent of the queen mother, Catherine de' Medici, he was assassinated by the bodyguards of her son, King Henry III.  Early Life  Henry I was born on the 31 December 1550, the eldest son of Francis Duke of Guise one of the leading magnates of France and Anna d'Este daughter of the Duke of Ferrara. In his youth he was friends with Henry III, the future king, and at the behest of Jacques, Duke of Nemours tried to persuade the young prince to run away with him in 1561 to join the arch-Catholic faction, much to the fury of his father and uncle. At the age of 12 his father was assassinated and he thus inherited the Dukes titles of the Governor of Champagne and Grand Maitre de France in 1563. The Guise family and Henry craved vengeance for who they perceived as responsible for the assassination, Gaspard II de Coligny. As such he and his uncle Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine would attempt a show of force entry into Paris in 1564, that ended with both besieged in their residence and forced to concede. When in 1566 the crown forced Charles at Moulins to make the kiss of peace with Coligny to end their feud, Henry refused to attend. He would also challenge Coligny and Anne de Montmorency to duels, but they rebuffed his attempts. No longer welcome at court, he and his brother Charles, Duke of Mayenne decided to crusade against the Ottoman Empire in Hungary, serving under Alfonso II d'Este, with a retinue of 350 men. In September 1568 he reached his majority, just as the Guise returned to the centre of French politics with his uncle's readmission onto the Privy Council. Entry into Politics He would take an active military role in the second and third wars of the French Wars of Religion fighting at the Battle of Saint-Denis in 1567, Battle of Jarnac in 1569, and successfully defending Poitiers during a siege by Admiral Coligny. He was wounded at the Battle of Moncontour. In 1570 the third war of religion was brought to an end with the Peace of Saint-Germain- en-Laye, part of which stipulated a marriage between the Protestant Henry IV of Navarre and the Kings sister Margaret of Valois as a means of ensuring stability. Around this time Henry began an affair with her, which quickly became known around court. Upon discovering this the King Charles IX and his brother Henri III were furious, assaulting Margaret in anger. While some suggested Henry be punished with assassination, it was settled on banishing him from court for his indiscretions. On 3 Oct he married Catherine of Cleves, thus assuming the title of Count of Eu from her inheritance. In August 1572 when Coligny was shot in the shoulder in an attempted assassination, Henry was a leading suspect due to his long running feud. This was quickly followed by the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre which took place on the occasion of Margaret's marriage to the Huguenot, Henry of Navarre. Margaret of Valois Catherine of Cleves Henry was wounded at the Battle of Dormans on 10 October 1575, and was thereafter known, like his father, as \\"Le Balafr√©\\". With a charismatic and brilliant public reputation, he rose to heroic stature among the Catholic population of France as an opponent of the Huguenots.  Catholic League  In 1576 he formed the Catholic League. The talent and dash of Guise contrasted favorably with the vacillation and weakness of Henry III. He was said to have claimed a Carolingian descent and cast eyes on the throne. This led to the stage of the Wars of Religion known as the War of the Three Henries (1584‚Äì1588). The Duke of Guise during the Day of the Barricades, by Paul Lehugeur, 19th century However, at the death in 1584 of Francis, Duke of Anjou, the king's brother (which left Henry of Navarre, the Protestant champion, as heir-male), Guise concluded the Treaty of Joinville with Philip II of Spain. This compact declared that the Cardinal de Bourbon should succeed Henry III, in preference to Henry of Navarre. Henry III now sided with the Catholic League (1585), which made war with great success on the Protestants. Guise sent his cousin Charles, Duke of Aumale, to lead a rising in Picardy (which could also support the retreat of the Spanish Armada). Alarmed, Henry III ordered Guise to remain in Champagne; he defied the king and on 9 May 1588 Guise entered Paris, bringing to a head his ambiguous challenge to royal authority in the Day of the Barricades and forcing King Henry to flee. Assassination Charlotte de Sauve Assassination of Henry I, Duke of Guise, by Henry III, in 1588. Painting by Charles Durupt in the Ch√¢teau de Blois, where the attack took place. The League now controlled France; the king was forced to accede to its demands and created Guise Lieutenant-General of France. But Henry III refused to be treated as a mere puppet by the League, and decided upon a bold stroke. On 22 December 1588, Guise spent the night with his current mistress Charlotte de Sauve, the most accomplished and notorious member of Catherine de' Medici's group of female spies known as the \\"Flying Squadron\\". The following morning at the Ch√¢teau de Blois, Guise was summoned to attend the king, and was at once assassinated by \\"the Forty-five\\", the king's bodyguard, as Henry III looked on. Guise's brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, was likewise assassinated the next day. The deed aroused such outrage among the remaining relatives and allies of Guise that Henry III was forced to take refuge with Henry of Navarre. Henry III was assassinated the following year by Jacques Cl√©ment, an agent of the Catholic League. According to Baltasar Gracian in A Pocket Mirror for Heroes, it was once said of him to Henry III, \\"Sire, he does good wholeheartedly: those who do not receive his good influence directly receive it by reflection. When deeds fail him, he resorts to words. There is no wedding he does not enliven, no baptism at which he is not godfather, no funeral he does not attend. He is courteous, humane, generous, the honorer of all and the detractor of none. In a word, he is a king by affection, just as Your Majesty is by law.\\" Issue He married on 4 October 1570 in Paris to Catherine of Cleves (1548‚Äì1633), Countess of Eu, by whom he had fourteen children: # Charles, Duke of Guise (1571‚Äì1640), who succeeded him # Henri (30 June 1572, Paris ‚Äì 3 August 1574) # Catherine (3 November 1573) (died at birth) # Louis III, Cardinal of Guise (1575‚Äì1621), Archbishop of Reims # Charles (1 January 1576, Paris) (died at birth) # Marie (1 June 1577 ‚Äì 1582) # Claude, Duke of Chevreuse (1578‚Äì1657) married Marie de Rohan, daughter of Hercule de Rohan, duc de Montbazon # Catherine (b. 29 May 1579), died young # Christine (21 January 1580) (died at birth) # Fran√ßois (14 May 1581 ‚Äì 29 September 1582) # Ren√©e (1585 ‚Äì 13 June 1626, Reims), Abbess of St. Pierre # Jeanne (31 July 1586 ‚Äì 8 October 1638, Jouarre), Abbess of Jouarre # Louise Marguerite, (1588 ‚Äì 30 April 1631, Ch√¢teau d'Eu), married on 24 July 1605 Fran√ßois, Prince of Conti # Fran√ßois Alexandre (7 February 1589 ‚Äì 1 June 1614, Ch√¢teau des Baux), a Knight of the Order of Malta In literature and the arts =Literature= The Duke of Guise appears as an archetypal Machiavellian schemer in Christopher Marlowe's The Massacre at Paris, which was written about 20 yearsOUP Complete Works of Christopher Marlowe 1998. pp. 294‚Äì295 after the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre.

They are situated on the western bank of Lake Nasser, about southwest of Aswan (about by road). The complex is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the \\"Nubian Monuments\\", which run from Abu Simbel downriver to Philae (near Aswan). The twin temples were originally carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century BC, during the 19th dynasty reign of the Pharaoh Ramesses II. They serve as a lasting monument to the king and his queen Nefertari, and commemorate his victory at the Battle of Kadesh. Their huge external rock relief figures have become iconic. The complex was relocated in its entirety in 1968 under the supervision of a Polish archaeologist, Kazimierz Micha≈Çowski from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw, on an artificial hill made from a domed structure, high above the Aswan High Dam reservoir. The relocation of the temples was necessary or they would have been submerged during the creation of Lake Nasser, the massive artificial water reservoir formed after the building of the Aswan High Dam on the River Nile. The project was carried out as part of the UNESCO Nubian Salvage Campaign.  History  = Construction = Genevese architect Jean Jacquet, a UNESCO expert, makes an architectural survey of the Great Temple of Rameses II (1290‚Äì1223 BC) During his reign, Ramesses II embarked on an extensive building program throughout Egypt and Nubia, which Egypt controlled. Nubia was very important to the Egyptians because it was a source of gold and many other precious trade goods. He, therefore, built several grand temples there in order to impress upon the Nubians Egypt's might and Egyptianize the people of Nubia.Verner, Miroslav. Temple of the Word: Sanctuaries, Cults and Mysteries of Ancient Egypt. (Cairo: The American University in Cairo Press, 2013).Hawass, Zahi. The Mysteries of Abu Simbel. (Cairo: The American University in Cairo Press, 2000). The most prominent temples are the rock-cut temples near the modern village of Abu Simbel, at the Second Nile Cataract, the border between Lower Nubia and Upper Nubia. There are two temples, the Great Temple, dedicated to Ramesses II himself, and the Small Temple, dedicated to his chief wife Queen Nefertari. Construction of the temple complex started in approximately 1264 BC and lasted for about 20 years, until 1244 BC. It was known as the \\"Temple of Ramesses, beloved by Amun\\". = Rediscovery = With the passage of time, the temples fell into disuse and eventually became covered by sand. By the 6th century BC, the sand already covered the statues of the main temple up to their knees. The temple was forgotten until 1813, when Swiss orientalist Johann Ludwig Burckhardt found the top frieze of the main temple. Burckhardt talked about his discovery with Italian explorer Giovanni Belzoni, who travelled to the site, but was unable to dig out an entry to the temple. Belzoni returned in 1817, this time succeeding in his attempt to enter the complex. A detailed early description of the temples, together with contemporaneous line drawings, can be found in Edward William Lane's Description of Egypt (1825‚Äì1828).Lane E, \\"Descriptions of Egypt,\\" American University in Cairo Press. pp.493-502. = Relocation = The statue of Ramses the Great at the Great Temple of Abu Simbel is reassembled after having been moved in 1967 to save it from flooding. A scale model showing the original and current location of the temple (with respect to the water level) at the Nubian Museum, in Aswan double crown of Lower and Upper Egypt The collapsed colossus of the Great Temple supposedly fell during an earthquake shortly after its construction. On moving the temple, it was decided to leave it as the face is missing. In 1959, an international donations campaign to save the monuments of Nubia began: the southernmost relics of this ancient human civilization were under threat from the rising waters of the Nile that were about to result from the construction of the Aswan High Dam. One scheme to save the temples was based on an idea by William MacQuitty to build a clear freshwater dam around the temples, with the water inside kept at the same height as the Nile. There were to be underwater viewing chambers. In 1962 the idea was made into a proposal by architects Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry and civil engineer Ove Arup.Fry Drew Knight Creamer, 1978, London, Lund Humphries They considered that raising the temples ignored the effect of erosion of the sandstone by desert winds. However, the proposal, though acknowledged to be extremely elegant, was rejected. The salvage of the Abu Simbel temples began in 1964 by a multinational team of archeologists, engineers and skilled heavy equipment operators working together under the UNESCO banner; it cost some US$40 million at the time (equal to $300 million in 2017 dollars). Between 1964 and 1968, the entire site was carefully cut into large blocks (up to 30 tons, averaging 20 tons), dismantled, lifted and reassembled in a new location 65 metres higher and 200 metres back from the river, in one of the greatest challenges of archaeological engineering in history.Spencer, Terence (1966). The Race to Save Abu Simbel Is Won. Life magazine, December 2, 1966. Some structures were even saved from under the waters of Lake Nasser. Today, a few hundred tourists visit the temples daily. Guarded convoys of buses and cars depart twice a day from Aswan, the nearest city. Many visitors also arrive by plane at an airfield that was specially constructed for the temple complex. The complex consists of two temples. The larger one is dedicated to Ra-Harakhty, Ptah and Amun, Egypt's three state deities of the time, and features four large statues of Ramesses II in the facade. The smaller temple is dedicated to the goddess Hathor, personified by Nefertari, Ramesses's most beloved of his many wives.Fitzgerald, Stephanie (2008). Ramses II: Egyptian Pharaoh, Warrior and Builder. New York: Compass Point Books. The temple is now open to the public.  Great Temple  View of the partially excavated Great Temple from the right, with a human figure for scale Front view of the Great Temple before 1923 Interior of the Great Temple, before cleaning Interior of the Great Temple, after cleaning Human figures standing at the entrance to the Great Temple, sometime before 1923 The Great Temple at Abu Simbel, which took about twenty years to build, was completed around year 24 of the reign of Ramesses the Great (which corresponds to 1265 BC). It was dedicated to the gods Amun, Ra-Horakhty, and Ptah, as well as to the deified Ramesses himself.Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994 It is generally considered the grandest and most beautiful of the temples commissioned during the reign of Ramesses II, and one of the most beautiful in Egypt. =Entrance= The single entrance is flanked by four colossal, statues, each representing Ramesses II seated on a throne and wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. The statue to the immediate left of the entrance was damaged in an earthquake, causing the head and torso to fall away; these fallen pieces were not restored to the statue during the relocation but placed at the statue's feet in the positions originally found. Next to Ramesses's legs are a number of other, smaller statues, none higher than the knees of the pharaoh, depicting: his chief wife, Nefertari Meritmut; his queen mother Mut-Tuy; his first two sons, Amun-her-khepeshef and Ramesses B; and his first six daughters: Bintanath, Baketmut, Nefertari, Meritamen, Nebettawy and Isetnofret. The fa√ßade behind the colossi is high and wide. It carries a frieze depicting twenty-two baboons worshipping the rising sun with upraised arms and a stele recording the marriage of Ramesses to a daughter of king ·∏™attu≈°ili III, which sealed the peace between Egypt and the Hittites. Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-√Ñgypten, 2005 The entrance doorway itself is surmounted by bas-relief images of the king worshipping the falcon-headed Ra Horakhty, whose statue stands in a large niche. Ra holds the hieroglyph user and a feather in his right hand, with Maat (the goddess of truth and justice) in his left; this is a cryptogram for Ramesses II's throne name, User-Maat-Re. =Interior= The inner part of the temple has the same triangular layout that most ancient Egyptian temples follow, with rooms decreasing in size from the entrance to the sanctuary. The temple is complex in structure and quite unusual because of its many side chambers. The hypostyle hall (sometimes also called a pronaos) is long and wide and is supported by eight huge Osirid pillars depicting the deified Ramesses linked to the god Osiris, the god of fertility, agriculture, the afterlife, the dead, resurrection, life and vegetation, to indicate the everlasting nature of the pharaoh. The colossal statues along the left-hand wall bear the white crown of Upper Egypt, while those on the opposite side are wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt (pschent). The bas-reliefs on the walls of the pronaos depict battle scenes in the military campaigns that Ramesses waged. Much of the sculpture is given to the Battle of Kadesh, on the Orontes river in present-day Syria, in which the Egyptian king fought against the Hittites. The most famous relief shows the king on his chariot shooting arrows against his fleeing enemies, who are being taken prisoner. Other scenes show Egyptian victories in Libya and Nubia. From the hypostyle hall, one enters the second pillared hall, which has four pillars decorated with beautiful scenes of offerings to the gods. There are depictions of Ramesses and Nefertari with the sacred boats of Amun and Ra- Horakhty. This hall gives access to a transverse vestibule, in the middle of which is the entrance to the sanctuary. Here, on a black wall, are rock cut sculptures of four seated figures: Ra-Horakhty, the deified king Ramesses, and the gods Amun Ra and Ptah. Ra-Horakhty, Amun Ra and Ptah were the main divinities in that period and their cult centers were at Heliopolis, Thebes and Memphis respectively. = Solar alignment = It is believed that the axis of the temple was positioned by the ancient Egyptian architects in such a way that on October 22 and February 22, the rays of the sun would penetrate the sanctuary and illuminate the sculptures on the back wall, except for the statue of Ptah, a god connected with the realm of the dead, who always remained in the dark. People gather at Abu Simbel on these days to witness this. These dates are allegedly the king's birthday and coronation day, respectively. There is no direct evidence to support this. It is logical to assume, however, that these dates had some relation to a great event, such as the jubilee celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the pharaoh's rule. In fact, according to calculations made on the basis of the heliacal rising of the star Sirius (Sothis) and inscriptions found by archaeologists, this date must have been October 22. This image of the king was enhanced and revitalized by the energy of the solar star, and the deified Ramesses the Great could take his place next to Amun-Ra and Ra-Horakhty. Because of the accumulated drift of the Tropic of Cancer due to Earth's axial precession over the past 3 millennia, the event's date must have been different when the temple was built. This is compounded by the fact that the temple was relocated from its original setting, so the current alignment may not be as precise as the original one. = Greek Graffito = A well-known graffito inscribed in Greek on the left leg of the colossal seated statue of Ramesses II, on the south side of the entrance to the temple records that: Kerkis was located near the Fifth Cataract of the Nile \\"which stood well within the Cushite Kingdom.\\"Britannica, p.756  Small Temple  The Small Temple from below and left, before 1923 The Small Temple after relocation The temple of Hathor and Nefertari, also known as the Small Temple, was built about northeast of the temple of Ramesses II and was dedicated to the goddess Hathor and Ramesses II's chief consort, Nefertari. This was in fact the second time in ancient Egyptian history that a temple was dedicated to a queen. The first time, Akhenaten dedicated a temple to his great royal wife, Nefertiti. The rock-cut facade is decorated with two groups of colossi that are separated by the large gateway. The statues, slightly more than high, are of the king and his queen. On either side of the portal are two statues of the king, wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt (south colossus) and the double crown (north colossus); these are flanked by statues of the queen. Set (left) and Horus (right) blessing Ramesses in the small temple at Abu Simbel Remarkably, this is one of very few instances in Egyptian art where the statues of the king and his consort have equal size. Traditionally, the statues of the queens stood next to those of the pharaoh, but were never taller than his knees. Ramesses went to Abu Simbel with his wife in the 24th year of his reign. As the Great Temple of the king, there are small statues of princes and princesses next to their parents. In this case they are positioned symmetrically: on the south side (at left as one faces the gateway) are, from left to right, princes Meryatum and Meryre, princesses Meritamen and Henuttawy, and princes Rahirwenemef and Amun- her-khepeshef, while on the north side the same figures are in reverse order. The plan of the Small Temple is a simplified version of that of the Great Temple. Nefertari offering sistrums to seated goddess Hathor, frieze inside the Small Temple As in the larger temple dedicated to the king, the hypostyle hall or pronaos in the smaller temple is supported by six pillars; in this case, however, they are not Osiris pillars depicting the king, but are decorated with scenes with the queen playing the sistrum (an instrument sacred to the goddess Hathor), together with the gods Horus, Khnum, Khonsu, and Thoth, and the goddesses Hathor, Isis, Maat, Mut of Asher, Satis and Taweret; in one scene Ramesses is presenting flowers or burning incense. The capitals of the pillars bear the face of the goddess Hathor; this type of column is known as Hathoric. The bas-reliefs in the pillared hall illustrate the deification of the king, the destruction of his enemies in the north and south (in these scenes the king is accompanied by his wife), and the queen making offerings to the goddesses Hathor and Mut. The hypostyle hall is followed by a vestibule, access to which is given by three large doors. On the south and the north walls of this chamber there are two graceful and poetic bas-reliefs of the king and his consort presenting papyrus plants to Hathor, who is depicted as a cow on a boat sailing in a thicket of papyri. On the west wall, Ramesses II and Nefertari are depicted making offerings to the god Horus and the divinities of the Cataracts‚ÄîSatis, Anubis and Khnum. The rock cut sanctuary and the two side chambers are connected to the transverse vestibule and are aligned with the axis of the temple. The bas-reliefs on the side walls of the small sanctuary represent scenes of offerings to various gods made either by the pharaoh or the queen. On the back wall, which lies to the west along the axis of the temple, there is a niche in which Hathor, as a divine cow, seems to be coming out of the mountain: the goddess is depicted as the Mistress of the temple dedicated to her and to queen Nefertari, who is intimately linked to the goddess.

Biography Little is known of his early life. The son of Henry Jenkins, a carpenter who occasionally made musical instruments, he may have been the \\"Jack Jenkins\\" employed in the household of Anne Russell, Countess of Warwick in 1603. The first positive historical record of Jenkins is amongst the musicians who performed the masque The Triumph of Peace in 1634 at the court of king Charles I. Jenkins was considered a virtuoso on the lyra viol. King Charles I commented that Jenkins did \\"wonders on an inconsiderable instrument.\\"The Consort Music of William Lawes, 1602‚Äì1645, John Patrick Cunningham, page 184 When the English Civil War broke out in 1642 it forced Jenkins, like many others, to migrate to the rural countryside. During the 1640s he was employed as music-master to two Royalist families, the Derham family at West Dereham and Hamon le Strange of Hunstanton. He was also a friend of the composer William Lawes (1602‚Äì1645), who was shot and died in battle at the siege of Chester. Around 1640 Jenkins revived the In Nomine, an archaic form for a consort of viols, based upon a traditional plainsong theme. He wrote a notable piece of programme music consisting of a pavane and galliard depicting the clash of opposing sides, the mourning for the dead and the celebration of victory after the siege of Newark (1646). In the 1650s Jenkins became resident music-master of Lord Dudley North in Cambridgeshire, whose son Roger wrote his biography. It was in these years, during the Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell, in the absence of much competition or organised music-making, that Jenkins took the occasion to write more than 70 suites for amateur household players. After the Restoration he obtained a place as a musician to the Royal Court. However, the viol consort was less fashionable in the court of king Charles II. Roger North wrote: :Tho' he for many years was incapable to attend, the Court musicians had so much value for him, that advantage was not taken, but he received his salary as they were paid. Something of Jenkins's own temperament is indicated by his setting the religious poetry of George Herbert to music. Like Joseph Haydn, he was a pious, reticent, and private person. Workmanlike and industrious in composition, he wrote dances by the cart-load according to North, who also stated ‚Äì :he was certainly a happy person,....of an easy temper, superior in his profession, well accepted by all, knew no want, saw himself outrun by the world, and having lived a good Christian, died in peace. Jenkins is buried in the nave of St. Peter's Church, Kimberley, Norfolk, with this inscription: ::Under this Stone Rare Jenkins lie ::The Master of the Musick Art ::Whom from the Earth the God on High ::Called up to Him to bear his part. ::Aged eighty six October twenty seven ::In anno seventy eight he went to Heaven. Musical style Jenkins was a long-active and prolific composer whose many years of life, spanning the time from William Byrd to Henry Purcell, witnessed great changes in English music. He is noted for developing the viol consort fantasia, being influenced in the 1630s by an earlier generation of English composers including Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger, Thomas Lupo, John Coprario and Orlando Gibbons. Jenkins composed numerous 4, 5, and 6 part fantasias for viol consort, almans, courants and pavanes, and he breathed new life into the antiquated form of the In Nomine. He was less experimental than his friend William Lawes; indeed, Jenkins's music was more conservative than that of many of his contemporaries. It is characterised by a sensuous lyricism, highly skilled craftsmanship, and an original usage of tonality and counterpoint. The musicologist Wilfrid Mellers claimed that J. S. Bach's Orchestral Suites No. 3 and No. 4 in D major (BWV 1068‚Äì69) recalled the sensibility of the physician- philosopher Sir Thomas Browne; however, the melancholic pavans, meditative fantasias and vigorous allemands of Jenkins are closer in era, antique style and temperament, to his Norfolk contemporary than Bach. Jenkins may even have socially met or performed in the presence of Browne while employed in his retirement years by Sir Philip Wodehouse of Kimberley as correspondence between Browne and Wodehouse survives.Geoffrey Keynes (ed.), The Works of Sir Thomas Browne (London: Faber & Faber, 1964), 4 vols.

Other important examples are 1,2-benzoquinone (ortho-quinone), 1,4-naphthoquinone and 9,10-anthraquinone. Properties Quinones are oxidized derivatives of aromatic compounds and are often readily made from reactive aromatic compounds with electron-donating substituents such as phenols and catechols, which increase the nucleophilicity of the ring and contributes to the large redox potential needed to break aromaticity. (Quinones are conjugated but not aromatic). Quinones are electrophilic Michael acceptors stabilised by conjugation. Depending on the quinone and the site of reduction, reduction can either rearomatise the compound or break the conjugation. Conjugate addition nearly always breaks the conjugation.

It is the precursor to anthraquinone. = Biochemistry = Ubiquinone-1 is a naturally occurring 1,4-benzoquinone that is involved in respiration apparatus. Ubiquinones, as their name implies, are ubiquitous in living creatures, being components of respiratory apparatus. right They are conjectured to occur in all respiring organisms. Some serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains such as those in photosynthesis (plastoquinone, phylloquinone), and aerobic respiration (ubiquinone). Phylloquinone is also known as Vitamin K1 as it is used by animals to carboxylate certain proteins, which are involved in blood coagulation, bone formation, and other processes. Conversely, the toxicity of paracetamol is due to its metabolism to a quinone imine, which then reacts with liver proteins to cause liver failure. In the spray of bombardier beetles, hydroquinone reacts with hydrogen peroxide to produce a fiery blast of steam, a deterrent in the animal world. The auto-oxidation of the neurotransmitter dopamine and its precursor L-Dopa generates the comparatively stable dopamine quinone which inhibits the functioning of dopamine transporter (DAT) and the TH enzyme leading to low mitochondrial ATP production. =Other natural products= The benzoquinone blattellaquinone is a sex pheromone in cockroaches. = Medicinal = Several quinones are of pharmacological interest. They form a major class of cytotoxins, used in the fight against cancers. One example is daunorubicin, which is antileukemic. Some of them show anti-tumoral activity. They embody some claims in herbal medicine. These applications include purgative (sennosides), antimicrobial and antiparasitic (rhein and saprorthoquinone, atovaquone), anti-tumor (emodin and juglone), inhibition of PGE2 biosynthesis (arnebinone and arnebifuranone) and anti-cardiovascular disease (tanshinone).Liu H., \\"Extraction and Isolation of Compounds from Herbal Medicines\\" in 'Traditional Herbal Medicine Research Methods', ed by Willow JH Liu 2011 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

The term is an American synecdoche for all Germans who fought on the British side, since 65% came from the German states of Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Hanau. Known for their discipline and martial prowess, around 30,000 Germans fought for the British during war, comprising a quarter of British forces. Although very often referred to by scholars as mercenaries, Hessians were legally and politically distinguished as auxiliaries; unlike mercenaries, who served a foreign government on their own accord, auxiliaries were soldiers hired out to a foreign party by their own government, to which they remained in service. Many German states regularly rented the service of their troops to fight in wars they had no interest in throughout the 18th century as a source of funding. Like most auxiliaries, Hessians served with foreign armies as entire units, fighting under Hessian flags, commanded by their usual officers, and wearing their existing uniforms. Hessians played a key role in the American Revolution. They served with distinction in many battles across North America, particularly in the northern theater, most notably at White Plains and Fort Washington. The added manpower and skill of German troops is credited for greatly sustaining the British war effort, but it also inflamed the American cause. The use of \\"large armies of foreign mercenaries\\" was one of the 27 colonial grievances against King George III in the Declaration of Independence, and Patriot propaganda cited Hessians as proof of British cruelty and indifference towards the colonists.Benjamin Franklin, ‚ÄúThe Sale of the Hessians,‚Äù (1777). Origin and history The use of foreign soldiers was not unusual in 18th century Europe. In the two centuries leading up to the American Revolution, the continent was characterized by constant warfare, and military manpower was in high demand. Germany was not yet a unified nation, but a collection of several hundred states loosely organized under the Holy Roman Empire. Conflict between and among these nations led to the creation of professional armies, which were consequently experienced and well trained. Many German societies became militarized, with most men undergoing annual training from adolescence well into adulthood, often serving for life or until they were too old.Charles Ingrao, The Hessian Mercenary State, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 2. German states varied considerably in size and wealth, and several came to rely on their troops as an economic resource, especially since sustaining a standing army was costly. When military conflict broke out, as it often did in Europe, German states provided a ready supply of trained troops prepared to go into action immediately. Hesse-Kassel soon emerged as the most prominent source of soldiers. To field a large professional army with a relatively small population, it became the most militarized state in Europe: 5.2% to 6.7% of its population were under arms in the 18th century‚Äîwith one in four households having someone serving in the army‚Äîa larger proportion than even heavily-militarized Prussia. Whereas Prussia relied partly on mercenaries from other German states, Hesse-Kassel employed only Landeskinder, native men. The military was the dominant force in the country. All Hessian males were registered for military service at the age of seven, and from the age of 16 until 30, had to annually present themselves to an official for possible recruitment. Only those whose occupation was considered vital to the country could be exempt. Those deemed \\"expendable\\", such as vagrants and the unemployed, could be conscripted at any time. Hessian military service was notably strict and demanding, emphasizing iron discipline through draconian punishment. However, morale was generally high, and soldiers were said to take pride in their service. Officers were usually well-educated and, in contrast to most European armies, promoted on the basis of merit. Soldiers were paid relatively high wages, and their families were exempt from certain taxes. Although plunder was officially verboten (forbidden), it remained common practice (as in most military forces at the time), offering another incentive for service. Overall, Hessian troops were considered superb fighters, even by their opponents. The Hessian military became a major source of economic strength. Hesse-Kassel manufactured its own weapons and uniforms, and its textile industry was so prosperous from supplying the military that workers could afford to buy meat and wine every day. The revenue from renting the army to the British equaled roughly thirteen years' worth of taxes, allowing the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, Friedrich II, to reduce taxes by one-third between the 1760s and 1784. A self-styled Enlightened despot, he also oversaw public works projects, administered a public welfare system, and encouraged education. The American historian Edward Jackson Lowell lauded Friedrich II for spending British money wisely, describing him as \\"one of the least disreputable of the princes who sent mercenaries to America\\". Well before the American Revolutionary War, Hessian soldiers were familiar in battlefields across 18th century Europe. In most of these wars, Hesse-Kassel was never formally a belligerent. While its troops remained members of the Hessian military, and even fought in their national uniform, they were hired out for service in other armies, without their government having any stake in the conflict. Thus, it was possible for Hessians to serve on opposing sides of the same conflict. In the War of the Austrian Succession, both Britain and Bavaria employed Hessian soldiers against one another; in the Seven Years' War, the forces of Hesse-Kassel served with both the Anglo-Hanoverian and the Prussian armies against the French; although Hesse-Kassel was technically allied to Britain and Prussia, her troops were actually leased by the British. Nevertheless, the practice of lending out auxiliaries did sometimes result in direct consequences. In July 1758, during the course of the Seven Years' War, most of Hesse-Kassel, including its capital, was occupied by a French army under Charles, Prince of Soubise, which easily overcame the home defence force of 6,000 Hessian militia. Soubise ordered his troops to live off the land, take high-ranking hostages, and extort payments of cash and produce, with the intention of forcing Hessian troops to withdraw from the war. Hessian and allied forces attempted to liberate their homeland but were repulsed at the Battle of Sanderhausen on 23 July. Following two sieges of Cassel, in 1761 and 1762, the capital was retaken, which constituted the last military action of the war. =\\"Mercenaries\\" versus \\"auxiliaries\\"= The characterization of Hessian troops as \\"mercenaries\\" remains controversial over two centuries later. American history textbooks refer to them as \\"mercenaries\\", and they are still widely perceived as such in the popular imagination. American historian Charles Ingrao describes Hesse as a \\"mercenary state\\" whose prince rented out his regiments to fund his government.Charles W. Ingrao, The Hessian mercenary state: ideas, institutions, and reform under Frederick II, 1760‚Äì1785 (Cambridge University Press, 2003) By contrast, British historian Stephen Conway called them \\"Britannia's auxiliaries\\". Canadian military historian Rodney Atwood notes that, contrary to some Patriot propaganda and perceptions, Hessians would not have been considered mercenaries at the time, but rather auxiliaries. Eighteenth century jurists distinguished mercenaries as those who served a foreign prince as individuals, whereas auxiliaries served their prince and were sent to the aid of another prince. Hessians would not be categorized as mercenaries under modern international law. Protocol I (1977) to the Geneva Convention defines a mercenary as \\"any person who ... has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.\\" Hessian troops served in America on official duty from the armed forces of Hesse-Cassel and Hesse-Hanau. Protocol I also requires a mercenary to be \\"promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party.\\" While not formally incorporated into the British military, Hessian troops were paid the same wages as British soldiers. Service during the American Revolution Image of Hessian hussars in America Great Britain maintained a relatively small standing army, so it found itself in great need of troops at the outset of the American Revolutionary War. Several German princes saw an opportunity to earn some extra income by hiring out their regular army units for service in America. Their troops entered the British service not as individuals but in entire units, with their usual uniforms, flags, equipment, and officers. Methods of recruitment varied according to the state of origin. The contingent from Waldeck for example was drawn from a principality army based on universal conscription, from which only students were exempt. Other German princes relied on long-service voluntary enlistment supplemented by conscription when numbers fell short. Many of the princes were closely related to the House of Hanover and were comfortable placing their troops under British command. A total of 29,875 German troops fought alongside British troops in the American Revolution, of which 16,992 came from Hesse- Kassel and 2,422 from Hesse-Hanau. Other contingents came from Brunswick (4,300), Ansbach-Bayreuth (2,353), Anhalt-Zerbst (1,119) and Waldeck (1,225). Since the majority of the German troops came from Hesse, Americans use the term Hessians to refer to all German troops fighting on the British side. =Deployment= Hessian troops included j√§gers, hussars, three artillery companies, and four battalions of grenadiers. Most infantrymen were chasseurs (sharpshooters), musketeers, and fusiliers. Line infantry was armed with muskets, while the Hessian artillery used the three-pound cannon. The elite j√§ger battalions used the b√ºchse, a short, large-caliber rifle well-suited to woodland combat. Initially, the average regiment was made up of 500 to 600 men. Later in the war, due to death in battle, death by disease, and general desertion to settle in the Colonies, the regiments may have been reduced to only around 300 to 400 men.Hatchment of Oberst Franz Carl Erdmann Freiherr von Seitz, St. Paul's Church (Halifax), Nova Scotia, d.1782 The first Hessian troops to arrive in North America landed at Staten Island, New York on August 15, 1776. Their first engagement was less than two weeks later, in the Battle of Long Island, the first major battle in the war. Hessians proved decisive to the British victory, and subsequently fought in almost every battle that year. By 1777, the British used them mainly as garrison and patrol troops. An assortment of Hessians fought in the battles and campaigns in the southern states during 1778‚Äì1780 (including Guilford Courthouse), and two regiments fought at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781. Hessians also served in Nova Scotia for five years (1778‚Äì1783), where they protected the colony from American privateers, such as during the Raid on Lunenburg (1782). They were led by Baron Oberst Franz Carl Erdmann von Seitz, who is commemorated in a church in Halifax. Notwithstanding their reputation as skilled and disciplined fighters, many British soldiers shared the American distrust of Hessians, who often spoke little or no English and were perceived as crude and barbaric. For their part, Hessian diaries frequently express disapproval of the British troops' conduct towards the colonists, including the destruction of property and the occasional execution of prisoners, the latter being doubly upsetting when American Germans were among them.Steven Schwamenfeld. \\"The Foundation of British Strength: National Identity and the Common British Soldier.\\" Ph.D. diss., Florida State University 2007, p. 123-124 =American attitudes= The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton, December 26, 1776, by John Trumbull, shows General Washington ordering medical help for the mortally wounded Hessian colonel, Johann Rall Americans, both Patriot and Loyalist, often feared the Hessians, believing them to be rapacious and brutal mercenaries. The American Declaration of Independence, written roughly a year after hostilities broke out, condemned King George III of \\"transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to [complete] the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\\" Throughout the war, reports of plundering by Hessians were said to have galvanized neutral colonists to join the Patriot side. General George Washington's Continental Army had crossed the Delaware River to make a surprise attack on the Hessians in the early morning of December 26, 1776. In the Battle of Trenton, the Hessian force of 1,400 was quickly overwhelmed by the Continentals, with only about 20 killed and 100 wounded, but 1,000 captured.\\"Battle of Trenton\\", British Battles.com, accessed 13 Feb 2010 The Hessians captured in the Battle of Trenton were paraded through the streets of Philadelphia to raise American morale; anger at their presence helped the Continental Army recruit new soldiers.Johannes Schwalm the Hessian, p. 21 Most of the prisoners were sent to work as farmhands. By early 1778, negotiations for the exchange of prisoners between Washington and the British had begun in earnest.Herbert M. Bahner and Mark A. Schwalm, \\"Johann Nicholas Bahner ‚Äì From Reichenbach, Hessen To Pillow, Pennsylvania\\", Journal of the Johannes Schwalm Historical Association, Inc. Vol. 3, No. 3, 1987 These included Nicholas Bahner(t), Jacob trobe, George Geisler, and Conrad Grein (Konrad Krain), who were a few of the Hessian soldiers who deserted the British forces after being returned in exchange for American prisoners of war.[Journal of Johannes Schwalm Historical Assoc., Inc Vol. 3, No. 1, p. 2] These men were both hunted by the British for being deserters and by many of the colonists as a foreign enemy. Throughout the war, Americans tried to entice Hessians to desert the British, emphasizing the large and prosperous German-American community. The U.S. Congress authorized the offer of land of up to 50 acres (roughly 20 hectares) to individual Hessian soldiers that switched sides. British soldiers were offered 50 to 800 acres, depending on rank.R. Douglas Hurt (2002) American Agriculture: A Brief History, p. 80Hessian soldiers captured during the Battle at Trenton taken to Philadelphia Many Hessian prisoners were held in camps at the interior city of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, home to a large German community known as the Pennsylvania Dutch. German prisoners were subsequently treated well, with some volunteering for extra work assignments, helping to replace local men serving in the Continental Army. After the war, many POWs never returned to Germany and instead accepted American offers of religious freedom and free land, becoming permanent settlers. By contrast, British prisoners were also held in Lancaster, but these men did not respond favorably to good treatment and often tried to escape.Ken Miller, Dangerous Guests: Enemy Captives and Revolutionary Communities during the War for Independence (Cornell Univ. Press, 2014) online review After the war ended in 1783, some 17,313 German soldiers returned to their homelands. Of the 12,526 who did not return, about 7,700 had died; some 1,200 were killed in action, and 6,354 died from illnesses or accidents, mostly the former. Approximately 5,000 German troops, most of whom had been press-ganged or conscripted in their countries of origin, opted to settle in either the United States or Canada. = Commanding officers = Wilhelm von Knyphausen, the commander of the Hessians in the American Revolutionary War * Wilhelm von Knyphausen * Oberst Franz Carl Erdmann Freiherr (Baron) von Seitz ‚Äì led the regiment in the Battle of Fort WashingtonColonel of the Hesse Cassel Garrison Regiment Von Seitz ‚Äì see Hessian (soldiers).

Early life  Born in Dundee, he was educated at the High School of Dundee, after which he trained as a lawyer, working his way up through the profession as an assistant to a variety of nobles. However, his major hobbies were astronomy and mathematics, and after coming up with a new method for using lunar occultation to measure longitude he came to the attention of Thomas Young, superintendent of the Royal Navy's \\"Nautical Almanac\\". Young helped the young Henderson enter the larger world of astronomical science, and on his death a posthumous letter recommended to the Admiralty that Henderson take his place.  Career  = Africa = Henderson was passed over for that position, but the recommendation was enough to get him a position at the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. There he made a considerable number of stellar observations between April 1832 and May 1833, including those for which he is remembered today. It was pointed out to him by Manuel John Johnson of the East India Company's observatory on Saint Helena that the bright southern star Alpha Centauri had a large proper motion, and Henderson concluded that it might be relatively close. The 1830s version of the \\"space race\\" was to be the first person to measure the distance to a star using parallax, a task which is easier the closer the star. Henderson was thus in a good position to be this person. After retiring back to the United Kingdom due to bad health, he began analysing his measurements and eventually came to the conclusion that Alpha Centauri was just slightly less than one parsec away, 3.25 light years. This figure is reasonably accurate, being 25.6% too small. Henderson did not immediately publish his results, however (there had been previous, discredited attempts to claim a measurement of stellar parallax), and eventually he was beaten to the punch by Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, who published a parallax of 10.3 light years (9.6% too small) for 61 Cygni in 1838. Henderson published his results in 1839, but was relegated to second place because of his lack of confidence. He later published confirming observations by Thomas Maclear. Alpha Centauri remained the nearest known star until the discovery of Proxima Centauri in 1915 by Robert T. A. Innes. = Scotland = Memorial to Thomas Henderson at the observatory on Calton Hill In the meantime, his measurement work at the Cape had led him to be appointed the first Astronomer Royal for Scotland in 1834. The vacant chair of astronomy at the University of Edinburgh was given to him on the advice of Prime Minister Lord Melbourne. From 1834 he worked at the City Observatory (then called the Calton Hill Observatory) in Edinburgh until his death.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online. Retrieved 20 March 2013. In April, 1840 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Henderson became a member or fellow of several distinguished societies, including the Royal Astronomical Society (1832) and the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1834).  Personal life and death  The grave of Alexander James Adie, Greyfriars Kirkyard He married Alexander Adie's daughter Janet Mary Adie (1808‚Äì1842) in 1836 and had one daughter, Janet Mary Jane Henderson (1842‚Äì1893). He died at home 1 Hillside Crescent in Edinburgh on 23 November 1844 and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. The grave may be either in the grave of Alexander Adie or in a grave marked by the stone \\"to his memory\\". His name is not recorded on the Adie grave; Adie himself died 14 years after Henderson. Recognition Memorial or gravestone for Thomas Henderson in Greyfriars Kirkyard A blue plaque is installed on his house at 1 Hillside Crescent. It refers to him as \\"Thomas J. A. Henderson\\", similar to middle names wrongly added to Wikipedia around 2007. A larger memorial (naming him \\"Thomas Henderson\\") is incorporated in the external wall of the City Observatory.

The shame brought about by accusations that he was involved in the forging of ancient biblical texts drove him to suicide in 1884. The discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls in 1947, in approximately the same area he claimed his material was discovered, has cast some doubt on the original forgery charges. Early life and career Moses Shapira was born in 1830 to Polish-Jewish parents in Kamenets-Podolski, which at the time was part of Russian-annexed Poland (in modern-day Ukraine). Shapira's father emigrated to Ottoman Palestine without Moses. Later, in 1856, at the age of 25, Moses Shapira followed his father to the Holy Land. His grandfather, who accompanied him, died en route. On the way, while in Bucharest, Moses Shapira converted to Christianity and applied for German citizenship, adding Wilhelm to his name. Once in Jerusalem, he joined the community of Anglican missionaries and converts who met at Christ Church, and in 1869 opened a store in the Street of the Christians, today's Christian Quarter Road. He sold the usual religious souvenirs enjoyed by pilgrims, as well as ancient pots he acquired from Arab farmers. While a patient in the German Lutheran congregation of Deaconess sisters, Shapira met a nurse, Deaconess Roseta Jackel, who became his wife.  Antiquities dealer and forger  In addition to selling souvenirs to tourists, Shapira also sold a variety of antiquities, some of it legitimate, and some of it fake, becoming the pre- eminent antiquities dealer for European collectors. After one lucrative deal in which he sold 1,700 fake figurines to a Berlin museum, Shapira was able to move outside the old city walls of Jerusalem with his family into an elegant villa on what is today Rav Kook Street, today known as Beit Ticho (Ticho House.) Moabite forgeries Shapira became interested in biblical artifacts after the appearance of the so-called Moabite Stone, also known as the Mesha Stele. He witnessed the huge interest around it and may have had a hand in negotiating on behalf of the German representatives. France eventually got the fragments of the original stone, leaving the British and the Germans rather frustrated. The squeeze which helped reconstruct the shattered Mesha Stele was taken on behalf of the French scholar and diplomat Charles Clermont-Ganneau by a Christian Arab painter and dragoman (tour-guide), Salim al-Khouri, better known as Salim al-Kari, \\"the reader\\", a nickname apparently given to him by the Bedouin due to his work with ancient alphabets. Salim soon became Shapira's associate and provided connections to Arab craftsmen who, along with Salim himself, produced for Shapira's shop large amounts of fake Moabite artifacts ‚Äì large stone-made human heads, but mainly clay objects: vessels, figurines and erotic pieces, generously covered with inscriptions based chiefly on the signs Salim had copied from the Mesha Stele. To modern scholars, the products seem clumsy ‚Äì inscriptions do not translate to anything legible, for one ‚Äì but at the time there was little with which to compare them. Shapira even organized an expedition to Moab for potential buyers, to sites where he had Salim's Bedouin associates bury more forgeries. Some scholars began to base theories on these pieces, and the term Moabitica was coined for this entirely new category of \\"Moabite\\" artifacts. Since German archaeologists had not gained possession of the Moabite Stone, they rushed to buy the Shapira Collection ahead of their rivals. Berlin's Altes Museum bought 1700 artifacts for the cost of 22,000 thalers in 1873. Other private collectors followed suit. One of them was Horatio Kitchener, a not yet famous British lieutenant, who bought eight pieces for the Palestine Exploration Fund. Shapira was able to move to the luxurious Aga Rashid property (modern- day Ticho House), outside Jerusalem's squalid Old City, with his wife and two daughters. Still various people, including Charles Clermont-Ganneau, had their doubts. Clermont-Ganneau suspected Salim al-Kari, questioned him and in time found the man who supplied him with clay, a stonemason who worked for him, and other accomplices. He published his findings in the Athenaeum newspaper in London and declared all \\"Moabitica\\" to be forgeries, a conclusion with which even the German scholars eventually concurred (cf. Emil Friedrich Kautzsch and Albert Socin, Die Echtheit der moabitischen Altert√ºmer gepr√ºft, 1876). Shapira defended his collection vigorously until his rivals presented more evidence against them. He placed the entire blame on Salim al-Kari, convinced almost everyone that he was just an innocent victim, and continued to do a considerable trade especially in genuine old Hebrew manuscripts from Yemen.  Manuscript forgeries  1883 Punch magazine cartoon of Shapira and Ginsburg In 1883 Shapira presented what is now known as the Shapira Strips, a supposedly ancient scroll written on leather strips which he claimed had been found near the Dead Sea. The Hebrew text hinted at a different version of Deuteronomy, including a surprising eleventh commandment (\\"Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: I am God, thy God\\"). Shapira sought to sell them to the British Museum for a million pounds, and allowed them to exhibit two of the 15 strips. The exhibition was attended by thousands. However, Clermont-Ganneau also attended the exhibition; Shapira had denied him access to the other 13 strips. After close examination, Clermont-Ganneau declared them to be forgeries. Soon afterward British biblical scholar Christian David Ginsburg came to the same conclusion. Later Clermont-Ganneau showed that the leather of the Deuteronomy scroll was quite possibly cut from the margin of a genuine Yemenite scroll that Shapira had previously sold to the Museum. Shapira fled London in despair, his name ruined and all of his hopes crushed. Six months later, on March 9, 1884, he shot himself in Hotel Bloemendaal in Rotterdam. The Shapira Strips disappeared and then reappeared a couple of years later in a Sotheby's auction, where they were sold for 10 guineas. In 1899 they were probably destroyed in a fire at the house of the presumed final owner, Sir Charles Nicholson. =No new final evidence= Despite the assessment of contemporary scholars - German ones from Halle, Leipzig and Berlin, Clermont-Ganneau from France, Christian David Ginsburg of London - declaring with good arguments either that the leather had only been recently processed, or that the Hebrew script and language used were flawed, and even leaving aside the fact that the peculiar \\"eleventh commandment\\" showed Christian leanings which could be connected to Shapira's own conversion, there have always been researchers claiming to have reasons to believe that the Deuteronomy scroll might be a genuine ancient artifact after all. The presumed but hard to prove physical loss of the strips in the 1899 fire leaves space for speculation, but none for actual research. There are no major scholars dealing with the issue currently, especially since nobody has produced any surviving fragment of the strips, the only useful facsimile being the well-known one created by Ginsburg back in 1883. The fact is also that contemporary press articles which ridiculed Shapira using anti-Semitic stereotypes did not precede, but rather followed the rejection of the scroll by a large range of scholars. Heritage Shapira \\"Moabitica\\" fakes still exist in museums and private collections around the world but are rarely displayed. By now they have become desirable collectibles in their own right. The exact location of Shapira's shop on Christian Quarter Road in Jerusalem has now been identified.

These objects were later revealed to be forgeries. Success Fujimura was born in Kami, Miyagi, in 1950. After graduating from a high school in Sendai, he obtained a job in a manufacturing company. He became intrigued by archaeology when he was a child, finding shards of J≈çmon pottery in the backyard of his house.Áô∫ÊéòÊçèÈÄ†, ÊØéÊó•Êñ∞ËÅûÊóßÁü≥Âô®ÈÅ∫Ë∑°ÂèñÊùêÁè≠, ÊØéÊó•Êñ∞ËÅûÁ§æ, 2001. In 1972 Fujimura began to study archaeology and to look for Paleolithic artifacts during his holidays. Within the few years to follow, he rose to fame among amateur and academic archaeologists in Sendai by which he was appointed the head of the NGO group, Sekki Bunka Kenkyukai in 1975. Fujimura discovered and excavated many Paleolithic stone artifacts in Miyagi prefecture, such as at Zazaragi site in 1981, Nakamine C site in 1983 and Babadan A site in 1984. From a cross-dating investigation of the stratum these stone tools were estimated to be about 50,000 years old. He established his reputation as a leading amateur archaeologist because he found most of the artifacts on his own. He even became known as the archaeologist with the \\"divine hands\\". After this success, he participated in 180 archaeological digs in northern Japan and almost always found artifacts, their age becoming increasingly older. Based on his discoveries the history of the Japanese Paleolithic period was extended to about 300,000 years. Most of the archaeologists did not question Fujimura's work and this discovery was written in the history textbooks. Later he gained a position as a deputy director at the private NGO group Tohoku Paleolithic Institute. Criticism Despite the acquiescence from the archeologists, some geologists and anthropologists claimed the discovery was dubious and lacked consistency with the geologic analysis of the sites. Toshiki Takeoka at the Kyoritsu Joshi University published an article„ÄéÂâçÊúüÊóßÁü≥Âô®„Äè„Å®„ÅØ„Å©„ÅÆ„Çà„ÅÜ„Å™Áü≥Âô®Áæ§„Åã, ÊóßÁü≥Âô®ËÄÉÂè§Â≠¶56, Áü≥Âô®ÊñáÂåñË´áË©±‰ºö, 1998 Shizuo Oda and Charles T.

The finds were estimated to be 570,000 years old. On November 5, 2000, the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun published pictures of Fujimura digging holes and burying the artifacts his team later found. The pictures had been taken one day before the finding was announced. Fujimura admitted his forgery in an interview with the newspaper. Fujimura confessed and apologized the same day in a press conference. He said that he had been \\"possessed by an uncontrollable urge\\". He had planted the artifacts from his own collection in strata that would have indicated earlier dates. In Kamitakamori he had planted 61 of 65 artifacts, and had earlier planted all of the stonework in the Soshin Fudozaka site in Hokkaid≈ç. He claimed that these were the only times he had planted artifacts. The Japanese Archaeological Association disaffiliated Fujimura from its members. A special investigation team of the Association revealed that almost all the artifacts which he had found were his fabrication.

She organised and led the Comet Line (Le R√©seau Com√®te) to assist Allied soldiers and airmen to escape from Nazi-occupied Belgium. The airmen were survivors of military airplanes shot down over Belgium or other European countries. Between August 1941 and December 1942, she escorted 118 people, including more than 80 airmen, from Belgium to neutral Spain from where they were transported to the United Kingdom. Arrested by the Nazis in January 1943, she was incarcerated for the remainder of World War II. After the war, she worked in leper hospitals in Africa. De Jongh was the recipient of the George Medal from the United Kingdom and the Medal of Freedom with golden palms from the United States and many other medals for her work during World War II. Her exploits were described in or inspired several books, movies, and television shows.  Early life  Andr√©e or D√©d√©e de Jongh was born in Schaerbeek in Belgium, then under German occupation during the First World War. She was the younger daughter of Fr√©d√©ric de Jongh, the headmaster of a primary school and Alice Decarpentrie. Edith Cavell, a British nurse shot in the Tir national in Schaerbeek in 1915 for assisting troops to escape from occupied Belgium to the neutral Netherlands, was a heroine in her youth. She trained as a nurse and became a commercial artist in Malm√©dy. Her nursing endeavours were inspired by Cavell. She was 23 years old when the Germans invaded and occupied Belgium. De Jongh was described by a British airman she helped as a \\"frail young girl who appears twenty years [old], very pretty, pleasant, kind, cheerful, and simple. She seems to have the carelessness of a young student who would go on vacation after passing her exams.\\" Later, a British colonel would call her a \\"pure heroine of legend.\\"\\"Free Belgians,\\" , accessed 3 Oct 2019  Origin of the Comet Line  De Jongh's house in Schaarbeek After German troops invaded and occupied Belgium in May 1940, De Jongh moved to Brussels, where she became a Red Cross volunteer, ministering to captured Allied troops. In Brussels at that time, hiding in safe houses, were many British soldiers, those left behind at Dunkirk and escapees from those captured at Saint-Valery-en-Caux. De Jongh organised a series of safe houses for these soldiers, while also procuring civilian clothes so they would not be identified as well as false ID papers. Visiting the sick and wounded soldiers enabled her to make links with this network of safe-house keepers who were trying to work out ways to get the soldiers back to Britain. In spring 1941, Henri de Bliqui, Arnold Depp√®, and Andr√©e de Jongh organised a group of friends to help Allied soldiers and airmen escape occupied Belgium and return to Great Britain. This was the origin of what became known as the Comet Line. They initially called themselves the DDDs after their last names. De Blique was arrested in April after the group was infiltrated by Prosper Dezitter, a Belgian collaborator with the Germans.Connart, Philippe, \\"A Brief Story of the Comete Line,\\" , accessed 3 Oct 2019 In June 1941, Depp√© journeyed from Belgium to southwestern France where he had once lived to look for the means to smuggle Allied soldiers, downed airmen, and other people vulnerable to capture by the Germans out of Belgium.Ottis, Sherri Greene (2001), Silent Heroes, Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, p. 121. Depp√© made contact with Elvire de Greef and her family and arranged for their help in getting people across the border. Elvire became known as \\"Tante Go\\" (\\"Auntie Go\\").Langthorne, Mark and Richards, Matt (2018), The Hidden Army ‚Äì M19's Secret Force and the Untold Story of D-Day, London: King's Row Publishing, np.\\"The Beginning of Comete,\\" , accessed 16 Sep 2019 De Jongh and Depp√©, assisted by the de Greefs, attempted their first crossing of the Spanish border in July 1941 with ten Belgians and \\"Miss Richards,\\" supposedly an English woman but actually a Belgian secret agent named Frederique Dupuich. After they successfully crossed the Pyrenees mountains on the Franco-Spanish border, de Jongh and Depp√© left their charges to fend for themselves and returned to Belgium. The ten Belgians and \\"Miss Richards\\" were arrested by Spanish police. Three Belgian soldiers among them were turned over to the Germans in France. From this experience, de Jongh realised that in future exfiltrations they must establish a relationship with the British Consulate in Bilbao to ensure the safety in Spain of the people they escorted out of occupied Belgian and France.\\"WWII escape and evasion,\\" , accessed 16 Aug 2019\\"Comete,\\" , accessed 16 Aug 2019 In August, Depp√© and de Jongh escorted another group of people, de Jongh taking a longer, more rural, and safer route with three men, including a British soldier, and Depp√© a shorter, more dangerous route with six men. An informer betrayed Depp√© and his party and they were arrested by the Germans. Depp√© was imprisoned for the remainder of the war.\\"Liste des personnes ayant aid√© des aviateurs pass√©s par Com√®te,\\" . accessed 17 Sep 2019 De Jongh arrived safely at the de Greef house in Anglet and crossed into Spain with a Basque smuggler as a guide.Ottis, pp. 121‚Äì122 She appeared in the British consulate in Bilbao with a British soldier (James Cromar from Aberdeen) and two Belgian volunteers (Merchiers and Sterckmans), having travelled mostly by train from Brussels to Bayonne and then on foot over the Pyrenees through the Basque Country. The British diplomats were initially sceptical of de Jongh. It seemed unlikely to them that this young woman with three soldiers in tow had travelled from German- occupied Belgium, through occupied France, and over the Pyrenees to Spain, a straight-line distance of some (and much further by the roundabout route they had taken). De Jongh promised to exfiltrate additional British soldiers and airmen if the British would pay the Comet Line's expenses which were 6,000 Belgian Francs and 1,400 Spanish pesetas (the sum of the two currencies amounting to the equivalent of $2,000 in 2018 U.S. dollars) for each Allied airmen or soldier exfiltrated. After three weeks of indecision by British authorities in Spain and the United Kingdom, the British agreed to her terms. Except for financial assistance, de Jongh turned down all other British offers of advice and assistance. She rejected efforts by the British and the Belgian government in exile to control or direct the Comet Line.Ottis, pp. 122‚Äì123Neave, Airey (1970), The Escape Room, Garden City, NY: Doubleday & Co., pp. 126‚Äì127  Exfiltrating Allied airmen  The arrest of Arnold Depp√© in August 1941 introduced a note of caution into the Comet Line. Andr√©e de Jongh decided that Belgium was unsafe and thereafter worked and lived in Paris and Valenciennes, a French city on the border with Belgium. Her father Fernand took over some of her leadership duties in Belgium. In France, de Jongh received airmen from Brussels, cared for them in safe houses, escorted them by railroad to Bayonne or nearby cities near the Spanish border, and trekked with them across the Pyrenees to Spain. She escorted one group of three airmen in October 1941, another group of three in November, and two groups totaling 11 men in December 1941. That level of activity continued in 1942.\\"Chronology of the Passages,\\" , accessed 25 Sep 2019 Once she had successfully crossed the border, de Jongh turned her charges over to the British who would drive them to Gibraltar where they would be flown back to Great Britain. While the airmen proceeded onward, de Jongh met in San Sebastian with British diplomat Michael Creswell, (\\"Monday\\"), who gave her money for the Comet Line's expenses plus messages to take back to France. While returning to Paris she would reinforce the system of safe houses and helpers along the route and pay necessary expenses, although most members of Comet Line never received any compensation for their expenses.Neave, pp. 130‚Äì136\\"Free Belgians,\\" , accessed 4 Oct 2019 Estimates of the number of times that de Jongh successfully escorted downed airmen across the border into Spain in 1941 and 1942 vary from 16 to 24 round trips. The number of persons, mostly airmen, she escorted successfully is about 118.Eisner, Peter (2005), The Freedom Line, New York: Harper Collins, p. 13Ottis, p. 127  Captured  The Bidasoa River, the Franco/Spanish border, near the crossing point of the Comet Line. Comet Line members and their families took great risks. In November 1942 the escape lines became more dangerous, after southern France was occupied by the Germans and the whole of France came under direct Nazi rule. During the war members of the Comet Line were betrayed and hundreds were arrested by the Geheime Feldpolizei and the Abwehr and were executed or deported to German prisons and concentration camps. In January 1943, de Jongh led three British airmen south by train from Paris to Saint-Jean-de-Luz. From the railway station they walked in rain for two hours to the village of Urrugne, in the French Basque country ‚Äì the last stop on the escape line before the walk over the Pyrenees. With the airmen and de Jongh was her favorite Basque guide Florentino Goikoetxea, a smuggler wanted by the police on both sides of the border. They arrived at the safe house belonging to Frantxia Usandizanga, a Basque woman, intending to continue to the border, distant. However, they learned that the Bidasoa River on the border was in flood and it would be too dangerous to attempt to cross. Goikoetxea went to another house to spend the night and de Jongh and the three airmen spent the night at Usandizanga's house. They next morning, 15 January 1943, de Jongh, the three airmen, and Usandizanga were arrested in the house by ten German soldiers. They had been betrayed, probably by a farm worker named Donato who de Jongh knew but did not trust.Eisner, Peter (2005), The Freedom Line, New York: Harper Collins, pp. 3‚Äì7 De Jongh was sent first to Fresnes prison in Paris and eventually to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp and Mauthausen. She was interrogated 19 times by the Abwehr and twice by the Gestapo. Although she admitted being the leader of the Comet Line to protect her father who was under suspicion, the Germans did not believe that this slight, young woman was more than a minor helper in the Comet Line.Neave, 177\\"Free Belgians,\\" , accessed 5 Oct 2019 In de Jongh's absence and under new leadership the Comet Line continued to function and helped more than 700 Allied soldiers reach safety during the war. Although de Jongh survived in the concentration camps, she became gravely ill and undernourished by the time she was released by the Allied advance in April 1945. Many of her colleagues died in captivity. Her father Fr√©d√©ric de Jongh was arrested in Paris on 7 June 1943 and executed on 28 March 1944. The three airmen arrested with her survived the war in prisoner-of-war camps.\\"Chronology of the Passages,\\" , accessed 25 Sep 2019 Usandizanga was beaten to death in Ravensbr√ºck by a guard shortly before the camp's liberation in April 1945.\\"Comete Sud au Pays Basque,\\" , accessed 5 Oct 2019 Goikoetxea continued to be the preferred Comet Line guide until wounded and captured by the Germans (but rescued by the de Greef family) shortly before France was liberated by the Allies in 1944.Jimenez de Aberasturi Corta, (2011), \\"La red 'Comete' en el Pais Vasco,\\" Rev.int.estud.vascos, Vol. 56, No. 2, pp. 562‚Äì563  Later life  After the war, de Jongh moved first to the Belgian Congo, then to Cameroon, next to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, working in leper hospitals and finally to Senegal. In failing health, she eventually retired to Brussels. For her wartime efforts, she was awarded the United States Medal of Freedom with golden palms, the British George Medal on 13 February 1946, and became a Chevalier of the French L√©gion d'honneur. She also became a Chevalier of the Order of Leopold, received the Belgian Croix de Guerre/Oorlogskruis with palm, and was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Belgian Army. In 1985, she was made a countess in the Belgian nobility by King Baudouin. In Spring of 1959, while working at a leper colony in Coquilhatville, she met with English novelist Graham Greene. Greene recorded her candid account of her war experiences in his journal which was published in 1961. In In Search of a Character: Two African Journals, Greene wrote that he asked her why she had come to the Congo. She replied, \\"Because from the age of fifteen I wanted to cure lepers.

According to legend, he held court in his saloon along the Rio Grande on a desolate stretch of the Chihuahuan Desert of southwest Texas. After his death, Western films and books cast him as a hanging judge, although he is known to have sentenced only two men to hang, one of whom escaped. Early life Roy Bean was born circa 1825 in Mason County, Kentucky, and was the youngest of five children (four sons and a daughter) of Phantly Roy Bean Sr. (November 21, 1804 ‚Äì June 13, 1844) and the former Anna Henderson Gore. The family was extremely poor and at age sixteen Bean left home to ride a flatboat to New Orleans, hoping to find work. After getting into trouble in New Orleans, Bean fled to San Antonio, Texas, to join his elder brother Sam. Samuel Gore \\"Sam\\" Bean (1819‚Äì1903), who had earlier migrated to Independence, Missouri, was a teamster and bullwhacker. He hauled freight to Santa Fe and then on to Chihuahua, Mexico. After Sam fought in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he moved out of San Antonio, where his brother Roy joined him. In 1848 the two brothers opened a trading post in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Soon after, Roy Bean shot and killed a Mexican desperado who had threatened \\"to kill a gringo\\". To escape being charged with murder by Mexican authorities, Roy and Sam Bean fled west to Sonora, Mexico. By the spring of 1849, Roy Bean had moved to San Diego, California, to live with his elder brother Joshua Bean, who would be elected the first mayor of San Diego the following year. Considered handsome, Bean competed for the attentions of various local women. A Scotsman named John Collins challenged Bean to a pistol-shooting match on horseback. Bean was left to choose the targets and decided that they would shoot at each other. The duel was fought on February 24, 1852, and ended with Collins receiving a wound to his right arm. Both men were arrested and charged with assault with intent to murder. In the two months that he was in jail, Bean received many gifts of flowers, food, wine and cigars from women in San Diego. Hidden in the final gifts he received while incarcerated were knives that were encased in tamales. Bean used the knives to dig through the cell wall and escaped on April 17, 1852. He then fled to San Gabriel, California, where he became a bartender in his brother Joshua's \\"Headquarters Saloon\\". After Joshua was murdered in November 1852, Bean inherited the saloon. In 1854 Bean courted a young woman who was subsequently kidnapped and forced to marry a Mexican officer. Bean challenged the groom to a duel and killed him. Six of the dead man's friends put Bean on a horse and tied a noose around his neck, leaving him to hang when the horse moved. When he was hanged, the rope stretched and Bean was able to stay alive. The bride, who had been hiding behind a tree, cut the rope, freeing him and saving his life. This experience left Bean with a permanent rope burn and a stiff neck for the rest of his life. Shortly thereafter, Bean chose to leave California and migrated to New Mexico to live with Sam, who had been elected the first sheriff of Do√±a Ana County. In 1861 Samuel G. and Roy Bean operated a store and saloon on Main Street in Pinos Altos (just north of Silver City) in present-day Grant County, New Mexico. It advertised liquor and \\"a fine billiard table\\". A cannon belonging to Roy Bean sat in front of the store for show and had been used to repel an Apache assault on the town. Move to Texas During the Civil War, the Confederate Army had invaded New Mexico. During the Battle of Glorieta Pass in March 1862, the Confederates lost their supply wagons and were forced to retreat to San Antonio. After taking money from his brother's safe, Bean joined the retreating army. For the remainder of the war, he ran the naval blockade by hauling cotton from San Antonio to British ships off the coast at Matamoros and returning with needed supplies. For the next twenty years, Bean lived in San Antonio, working nominally as a teamster. During this time he attempted to run a firewood business by cutting down a neighbor's timber. He then tried to run a dairy business but was soon caught watering down the milk. Bean later worked as a butcher, rustling unbranded cattle from other area ranchers for his business. On October 28, 1866, he married eighteen-year-old Virginia Chavez. Within a year after being married, he was arrested for aggravated assault and threatening his wife's life. Despite the tumultuous marriage, they had four children together: Roy Jr., Laura, Zulema and Sam. The family lived in what was described as \\"a poverty-stricken Mexican slum area called Beanville\\". Beanville would have been centered near the current day corner of South Flores Street and Glenn Avenue not far from Burbank High School. By the late 1870s Bean was operating a saloon in Beanville and had heard that many construction camps were opening as several railroad companies were working to extend the railroads west. A store owner in Beanville \\"was so anxious to have this unscrupulous character out of the neighborhood\\" that she bought all of Bean's possessions for $900 so that he could leave San Antonio. At the time, Bean and his wife were separated and he had left his children with friends as he prepared to go west. =Justice of the peace= With the money he received, Bean purchased a tent, some supplies to sell, and ten 55-gallon barrels of whiskey. By the spring of 1882, he had established a small saloon near the Pecos River in a tent city he named Vinegaroon. Within of the tent city were 8,000 railroad workers. The nearest court was away at Fort Stockton, and there were few means to stop illegal activity. A Texas Ranger requested that a local law jurisdiction be set up in Vinegaroon, and on 2 August 1882 Bean was appointed justice of the peace for the new Precinct 6 in Pecos County. His first case, however, was heard earlier, on 25 July 1882, when Texas Rangers brought in Joe Bell to be tried. One of his first acts as a justice of the peace was to \\"shoot [...] up the saloon shack of a Jewish competitor\\". Bean then turned his tent saloon into a part-time courtroom and began calling himself the \\"Only Law West of the Pecos.\\" As a judge, Bean relied on a single law book, the 1879 edition of the Revised Statutes of Texas, and when newer law books showed up he used them as kindling. Bean did not allow hung juries or appeals. Jurors, who were chosen from his best bar customers, were expected to buy a drink during every court recess. He was also known for his unusual rulings. In one case, an Irishman named Paddy O'Rourke shot a Chinese laborer. During the trial, a mob of 200 angry Irishmen surrounded the courtroom and saloon, threatening to lynch Bean if O'Rourke was not freed. After looking through his law book, Bean ruled that \\"homicide was the killing of a human being; however, he could find no law against killing a Chinaman\\" and subsequently dismissed the case.El Paso Daily Herald, August 28, 1897, Image 3 Accessed January 4,2020. By December 1882, railroad construction had moved farther westward and Bean moved his courtroom and saloon to Strawbridge (now Sanderson). He sent for his children, who then lived with him at the saloon, with his youngest son Sam sleeping on a pool table. A competitor who was already established in the area laced Bean's whiskey with kerosene. Unable to attract customers, Bean left the area and moved to Eagle's Nest, west of the Pecos River, which was soon renamed Langtry. Roy Bean holding court while sitting on a barrel and holding his law book at his Jersey Lilly Saloon 1900's The Jersey Lilly Saloon in September 2005 The original owner of the land, who ran a saloon, had sold to the railroad on the condition that no part of the land could be sold or leased to Bean. O'Rourke, the Irishman whose case Bean had previously dismissed, told Bean to use the railroad right-of-way, which was not covered by the contract, and for the next 20 years Bean squatted on land he had no legal right to use. Bean named his new saloon The Jersey Lilly in honor of Lillie Langtry, who recounted in her autobiography that she had visited the area after Bean's death. She did however send to Bean a pair of Colt. 45 pistolsSee Robert Elman's Fired In Anger. A 3rd 44/40 Colt Pistol owned by Bean was put up for auction in March 2009 see ProxibidLangtry did not have a jail ‚Äì although it is reported that outside The Jersey Lilly was a large oak tree with a heavy log chain that served as a \\"jail\\" for those unable to pay their fines; all cases were settled by fines. Bean refused to send the state any part of the fines, and kept all of the money. In most cases the fines were made for the exact amount the accused person was carrying. He was noted for his unusual verdicts, some of which are reported to have been:El Paso Daily Herald, August 28, 1897, Image 3 Accessed January 4,2020 *Upon finding the corpse of a Southern Pacific railroad workman who had been killed after he fell from a high bridge over the Pecos River, the man having been carrying a pistol in his pocket and $40 on his person when he had died, the judge rendered a verdict of accidental death and then imposed a posthumous $40 fineEl Paso Daily Herald, August 28, 1897, Image 3 Accessed January 4,2020 [a $20 fine upon the man for having carried the concealed weapons.

He charged $5 for weddings, and ended all wedding ceremonies with the phrase \\"and may God have mercy on your souls\\" (a traditional saying when a death sentence is carried out). After Bean performed the marriage of two Mexican couples, they later came before Bean and asked to be divorced and remarried to the other person's spouses; Bean agreed to the demand, charging each $10 for marriages and $40 for divorces. *When a Mexican received permission for one day off from his boss to marry his future wife but there was not enough time for a license, Bean married them anyway and proclaimed that the marriage license would arrive by the next day's mail after charging them his usual $5 marriage fee. *A rival saloon owner named Torrano was brought before Bean on an assault charge; a jury of six men found the accused guilty and fined him two dozen bottles of beer. Bean stopped his rival from buying beer at his own saloon and instead had him pay retail fine at The Jersey Lilly. *A railroad contractor named Howard who had some law training was brought into court and read from the latest revised law statutes; Bean remitted the fine but rendered a verdict that no law books were to be brought into his court. *When a young ranchman was fined $5 for fighting, he produced witness that he had not been fighting but had held the other person off. Bean remitted the fine but fined the other man $10 ‚Äì who had skipped town. The ranchman was committed until the fine was paid; the ranchman paid the fine. Bean won re-election to his post in 1884, but was defeated in 1886. The following year, the commissioner's court created a new precinct in the county and appointed Bean to be the new justice of the peace. He continued to be re- elected until 1896. Even after the election defeat, he \\"refused to surrender his seal and law book and continued to try all cases north of the tracks\\". *On April 16, 1897 there was an accidental collision between two trains in which one man was killed and four scalded;El Paso Daily Herald, April 16, 1897, Image 4 Accessed January 4,2020 Bean presided over an inquest concerning the train wreck of the G.H.& S. railroad between Bean and Langtry finding one man had formerly been a fireman on the Southern Pacific Railroad.

Bean flagged down the train using a danger signal. Thinking the bridge was out, the train engineer stopped the train. Bean then invited Gould and his daughter to visit the saloon as his guests. The Goulds visited for two hours, causing a brief panic on the New York Stock Exchange when it was reported that Gould had been killed in a train crash. In 1896, Bean organized a world championship boxing title bout between Bob Fitzsimmons and Peter Maher on an island in the Rio Grande because boxing matches were illegal in both Texas and Mexico. The fight, won by Fitzsimmons, lasted only 1 minute and 35 seconds, but the resulting sport reports spread Bean's fame throughout the United States. As he aged, Bean spent much of his profits helping the poor of the area and always made sure that the local schoolhouse had free firewood in the winter. In January 1901 Bean stated that a claim for damages of $13,000 from Apache depredations of his mules would certainly be allowed.El Paso Daily Herald, January 21, 1901, Last Edition 4:30 p.m., Page 3, Image 3 Accessed January 4,2020 Roy Bean died peacefully in his bed on 16 March 1903 after a bout of heavy drinking in San Antonio.

Sakai had 28-64 aerial victories (including shared) by official Japanese records,Sakai saburo research book, pp.277. while his autobiography Samurai!, co-written by Martin Caidin and Fred Saito, claims 64 aerial victories. Such discrepancies are common, and pilots' official scores are often lower than those claimed by the pilots themselves, due to difficulties in providing appropriate witnesses or verifying wreckage, and variations in military reports due to loss or destruction. Early life Sabur≈ç Sakai was born on 25 August 1916 in Saga in Japan. Sakai was born into a family with immediate affiliation to samurai and their warrior legacies and whose ancestors (themselves samurai) had taken part in the Japanese invasions of Korea between 1592 to 1598, but who were later forced to take up a livelihood of farming following haihan-chiken in 1871.Sakai et al. 1978, pp. 1, 3. He is the third-born of four sons (his given name literally means \\"third son\\"), and had three sisters. Sakai was 11 when his father died, leaving his mother alone to raise seven children. With limited resources, Sakai was adopted by his maternal uncle, who financed his education in a Tokyo high school. However, Sakai failed to do well in his studies and was sent back to Saga after his second year. On 31 May 1933 at the age of 16, Sakai enlisted in the Japanese Navy as a Sailor Fourth Class (Seaman Recruit) (ÂõõÁ≠âÊ∞¥ÂÖµ). Sakai described his experiences as a naval recruit: Sakai posing in front of the hinomaru on his Mitsubishi A5M Type 96 fighter (Wuhan, 1939). :\\"The petty officers would not hesitate to administer the severest beatings to recruits they felt deserving of punishment. Whenever I committed a breach of discipline or an error in training, I was dragged physically from my cot by a petty officer. 'Stand tall to the wall! Bend down, Recruit Sakai!' he would roar. 'I am not doing this because I hate you, but because I like you and want you to make a good seaman. Bend down!' And with that he would swing a large stick of wood and with every ounce of strength he possessed would slam it against my upturned bottom. The pain was terrible, the force of the blows unremitting.\\"Forquer, John A. \\"The Kamikaze: Samurai Warrior, A New Appraisal.\\" globalsecurity.org. Retrieved: 5 April 2015. After completing his training the following year, Sakai graduated as a Sailor Third Class (Ordinary Seaman) (‰∏âÁ≠âÊ∞¥ÂÖµ). He then served aboard the battleship for one year. In 1935, he successfully passed the competitive examinations for the Naval Gunners' School. Sakai was promoted to Sailor Second Class (Able Seaman) (‰∫åÁ≠âÊ∞¥ÂÖµ) in 1936, and served on the battleship as a turret gunner. He received successive promotions to Sailor First Class (Leading Seaman) (‰∏ÄÁ≠âÊ∞¥ÂÖµ) and to Petty Officer Third Class (‰∏âÁ≠âÂÖµÊõπ). In early 1937, he applied for and was accepted into a pilot training school. He graduated first in his class at Tsuchiura in 1937 and earned a silver watch, presented to him by Emperor Hirohito himself. Sakai graduated as a carrier pilot, although he was never assigned to aircraft-carrier duty. Promoted to Petty Officer Second Class (‰∫åÁ≠âÂÖµÊõπ) in 1938, Sakai took part in aerial combat flying the Mitsubishi A5M at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1938‚Äì1939 and was wounded in action.

Service in World War II =Southeast Asia= Sabur≈ç Sakai as a petty officer wearing life preserver When Japan attacked the Western Allies in 1941, Sakai participated in the attack on the Philippines as a member of the Tainan Air Group.

Retrieved: 5 April 2015. from the Tainan K≈çk≈´tai (a K≈çk≈´tai was an Air Group) that attacked Clark Air Base in the Philippines. In his first combat against Americans, he shot down a Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and destroyed two B-17 Flying Fortresses by strafing them on the ground. Sakai flew missions the next day during heavy weather. On the third day of the battle, Sakai claimed to have shot down a B-17 flown by Captain Colin P. Kelly. Sakai, who has often been credited with the victory, was a Shotai leader engaged in this fight with the bomber, although he and his two wingmen do not appear to have been given official credit for it.Shores, Cull and Izawa 1992, p. 182. Early in 1942, Sakai was transferred to Tarakan Island in Borneo and fought in the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese high command instructed fighter patrols to down all enemy aircraft encountered, whether they were armed or not. On a patrol with his Zero over Java, just after shooting down an enemy aircraft, Sakai encountered a civilian Dutch Douglas DC-3 flying at low altitude over dense jungle. Sakai initially assumed it was transporting important people and signaled to its pilot to follow him; the pilot did not obey. Sakai descended and approached the DC-3. He then saw a blonde woman and a young child through a window, along with other passengers. The woman reminded him of Mrs. Martin, an American who occasionally had taught him as a child in middle school and had been kind to him. He ignored his orders and flew ahead of the pilot, signaling him to go ahead. The pilot and passengers saluted him.Interview from April 2000 Sakai did not mention the encounter in the aerial combat report.Japan Center for Asian Historical Record, Tainan Air Group action report Reference code C08051602100. During the Borneo campaign, Sakai achieved 13 more victories before he was grounded by illness. When he recovered three months later in April, Petty Officer First Class Sakai joined a squadron (chutai) of the Tainan K≈çk≈´tai under Sub-Lieutenant Junichi Sasai at Lae, New Guinea. Over the next four months, he scored the majority of his victories, flying against American and Australian pilots based at Port Moresby. On the night of 16 May, Sakai and his colleagues, Hiroyoshi Nishizawa and Toshio Ota, were listening to a broadcast of an Australian radio program, when Nishizawa recognized the eerie \\"Danse Macabre\\" of Camille Saint-Sa√´ns. Inspired by this, Nishizawa came up with the idea of doing demonstration loops over the enemy airfield. The next day, his squadron included fellow aces Hiroyoshi Nishizawa and Toshio ≈åta.

It read (paraphrased): \\"Thank you for the wonderful display of aerobatics by three of your pilots. Please pass on our regards and inform them that we will have a warm reception ready for them, next time they fly over our airfield\\".

The initial Allied landings captured an airfield, later named Henderson Field by the Allies, that had been under construction by the Japanese. The airfield soon became the focus of months of fighting during the Guadalcanal Campaign, as it enabled U.S. airpower to hinder the Japanese attempts at resupplying their troops. The Japanese made several attempts to retake Henderson Field, resulting in continuous, almost daily air battles for the Tainan K≈çk≈´tai. U.S. Marines flying Grumman F4F Wildcats from Henderson Field on Guadalcanal were using a new aerial combat tactic, the \\"Thach Weave\\", developed in 1941 by the U.S. Navy aviators John Thach and Edward O'Hare.

However, he soon realised that he had made a mistake - the planes were in fact carrier-based bombers with rear-mounted machine guns. Despite this realisation, he was now committed to the attack.Winged Samurai, pp. 74-76. In Sakai's account of the battle, he identifies the aircraft as Grumman TBF Avengers - he stated he could clearly see the enclosed top turret. He claimed to have shot down two of the Avengers (his 61st and 62nd victories) before return fire struck his plane. These kills were seemingly verified by the three Zero pilots following him. However, no Avengers were reported lost that day. However, according to US Navy records, only one formation of bombers reported fighting Zeros under these circumstances. This was a group of eight SBD Dauntlesses from Enterprise, led by Lt Carl Horenberger of Bombing Squadron 6 (VB-6). The SBD crews reported being attacked by two Zeros, one of which came in from directly astern and flew into the concentrated fire from their rear-mounted twin .30 AN/M2 guns. The rear gunners claimed the Zero as a kill when it dove away to its (presumed) destruction, in return for two planes damaged (one seriously).Stafford, The Big E, p.134; Hammel, Carrier Clash, pp.69-70; Lundstrom, The First Team and the Guadalcanal Campaign, p.56; Basic report in Enterprise Action Report for August 7, 1942 (Flight 319) Whatever the case, Sakai sustained serious injuries from the bombers' return fire. He was hit in the head by a .30 caliber bullet, injuring his skull and temporarily paralyzing the left side of his body. (The wound is described elsewhere as having destroyed the metal frame of his goggles, and having \\"creased\\" his skull, a glancing blow which broke the skin and made a furrow in, or even cracked the skull, but did not actually penetrate it). Shattered glass from the canopy temporarily blinded him in his right eye and reduced vision in his left eye severely. The Zero rolled inverted and descended toward the sea. Unable to see out of his left eye due to glass and blood from his serious head wound, Sakai's vision started to clear somewhat as tears cleared the blood from his eyes, and he was able to pull his plane out of the dive. He considered ramming an American warship: \\"If I must die, at least I could go out as a Samurai. My death would take several of the enemy with me. A ship. I needed a ship.\\" Finally, the cold air blasting into the cockpit revived him enough to check his instruments, and he decided that by leaning the fuel mixture he might be able to return to the airfield at Rabaul. Rabaul, 8 August 1942: A seriously wounded Sakai returns to Rabaul with his damaged Zero after a four-hour, 47-minute flight over . Sakai's skull was penetrated by a machine-gun bullet and he was blind in one eye, but insisted on making his mission report before accepting medical treatment. Although in agony from his injuries\\"Original flight helmet Sakai wore on his fateful mission when he was wounded.\\" www.j-aircraft.com. Retrieved: April 5, 2015. Sakai managed to fly his damaged Zero in a four-hour, 47-minute flight over back to his base on Rabaul, using familiar volcanic peaks as guides. When he attempted to land at the airfield he nearly crashed into a line of parked Zeros but, after circling four times, and with the fuel gauge reading empty, he put his Zero down on the runway on his second attempt. After landing, he insisted on making his mission report to his superior officer before collapsing. His squadron mate Hiroyoshi Nishizawa drove him to a surgeon. Sakai was evacuated to Japan on 12 August, where he endured a long surgery without anesthesia. The surgery repaired some of the damage to his head, but was unable to restore full vision to his right eye. Nishizawa visited Sakai while he recuperated in the Yokosuka hospital in Japan. =Recovery and return= After his discharge from the hospital in January 1943, Sakai spent a year training new fighter pilots.Hards, Scott.\\"An afternoon with Saburo Sakai.\\" warbirdforum.com, 1998. Retrieved: 9 April 2015. With Japan clearly losing the air war, he prevailed upon his superiors to let him fly in combat again. In November 1943, Sakai was promoted to the rank of flying warrant officer (È£õË°åÂÖµÊõπÈï∑). In April 1944, he was transferred to Yokosuka Air Wing, which was deployed to Iwo Jima. On 24 June 1944, Sakai approached a formation of 15 U.S. Navy Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters which he had mistakenly assumed were friendly Japanese aircraft. William A. McCormick saw four Hellcats on the Zero's tail, but decided not to get involved. Sakai demonstrated his skill and experience. Despite facing superior enemy aircraft, Sakai eluded attacks by the Hellcats, returning to his airfield untouched.Sakaida 1985. Sakai claimed to have never lost a wingman in combat; however, he lost at least two over Iwo Jima.Japan Center for Asian Historical Record, Yokosuka Air Group action report Reference code C13120487500. Sakai said as follows: he was ordered to lead a kamikaze mission on 5 July, but he failed to find the U.S. task force. He was engaged by Hellcat fighters near the task force's reported position, and all but one of the Nakajima B6N2 \\"Jill\\" torpedo bombers in his flight were shot down. Sakai managed to shoot down one Hellcat, then escaped the umbrella of enemy aircraft by flying into a cloud. Rather than follow meaningless orders, in worsening weather and gathering darkness, Sakai led his small formation back to Iwo Jima.Sakaida 1998. While, according to the aerial combat report, his mission was to escort bombers to and from their targets, and it was afternoon 24 June the day Sakai joined the attack on the U.S. task force. In August 1944, Sakai was commissioned an ensign (Â∞ëÂ∞â). After he was transferred to 343rd Air Group, he returned to the Yokosuka Air Wing again. About the same time, Sakai married his cousin Hatsuyo, who asked him for a dagger so she could kill herself if he fell in battle. His autobiography, Samurai!, ends happily with Hatsuyo throwing away the dagger after Japan's surrender, saying she no longer needed it. Saburo Sakai participated in the IJNAS's last wartime mission, attacking two reconnaissance Consolidated B-32 Dominators on 18 August, which were conducting photo-reconnaissance and testing Japanese compliance with the cease-fire. He initially misidentified the planes as Boeing B-29 Superfortresses. Both aircraft returned to their base at Yontan Airfield, Okinawa. His encounter with the B-32 Dominators in the IJNAS's final mission was not included in Samurai!. He was promoted to sub-lieutenant (‰∏≠Â∞â) after the war ended.

Likewise, although Japan had been defeated in the Second World War with great loss of life, Sakai serenely accepted this outcome: \\"Had I been ordered to bomb Seattle or Los Angeles in order to end the war, I wouldn't have hesitated. So I perfectly understand why the Americans bombed Nagasaki and Hiroshima.\\" Times were difficult for Sakai: he had trouble finding a job; Hatsuyo died in 1947. * Sakaida, Henry.

He was the last person to have the civil rank of Active Privy Councillor, 1st class. Biography Goremykin was born on 8 November 1839 into a noble family. In 1860 he completed studies at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence and became a lawyer in Saint Petersburg. In the Senate, Goremykin became responsible for agriculture in Congress Poland. In 1866 he was appointed as vice governor in P≈Çock and in 1869 in Kielce. In 1891 he was appointed as deputy minister of justice, considered being an expert on the \\"peasant question\\". Within a year he moved to the Ministry of the Interior, becoming Minister from 1895-1899. A self-described \\"man of the old school\\" who viewed the Tsar as the \\"anointed one, the rightful sovereign\\", Goremykin was a loyal supporter of Nicholas II as autocrat and accordingly pursued conservative policy. He was apparently well liked by the Empress Alexandra. (In 1894 he was appointed as senator; in 1896 as Actual Privy Councillor and became a member of the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society). In 1897 Vladimir Chertkov, a leading member of the Tolstoyan movement, was banned by Goremykin or his ministry. While heading the Interior Ministry he submitted a proposal to the Tsar advocating administrative reform and the expansion of the zemstvo program and representation within the existing Zemstvos. Faced with opposition to the program, he left the position in 1899. In April 1906, Sergei Witte, a reformist, was succeeded by Goremykin. In the Russian Constitution of 1906 the Tsar, regretting his 'moment of weakness' when signing the October Manifesto, retained the title of autocrat and maintained his unique dominating position in relation to the Russian Church.Riasanovsky, N.V. (1977) A History of Russia, p. 453. Goremykin's unwavering opposition to the political reform demanded by the First Duma left him unable to work with that body and he resigned in July 1906 after a conflict about ministerial responsibility and rejecting radical agrarian reforms proposed by Duma. He was replaced by his Minister of Interior, the younger and more forceful Peter Stolypin. Ivan Goremykin (on the right) and Nikolai Gerard (in 1905 Governor-General of Finland) during a ceremonial meeting of the State Council May 7, 1901. Painting by Ilya Repin Called back to service by the Tsar, he again served as Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) from April 1914 to February 1916. Vladimir Kokovtsov was replaced by the decrepit and absent- minded Goremykin, and Bark as Minister of Finance. \\"Seventy-five years of age, a conservative, and a life-long bureaucrat, he was, in his own words, ‚Äòpulled like a winter coat out of mothballs,‚Äô to lead the government ... The hostility expressed toward him by members of both the State Duma and the Council of Ministers greatly impaired the effectiveness of his government. When Nicholas II decided to take direct command of the army, Goremykin and Alexander Krivoshein begged the Tsar not to lead the army and leave the capital. All the ministers realized that the change would put the Empress and Rasputin in charge and threatened to resign.Fuhrmann, pp. 148‚Äì149Moe, pp. 331‚Äì332. Goremykin urged the Council to endorse the decision. When they refused, Goremykin told the Tsar that he was not fitted and asked to be replaced with \\"a man of more modern views\\". He held a hostile attitude towards the Imperial Duma and the Progressive Bloc. In January 1916 Rasputin was opposed to the plan to send the old Goremykin away,Frank Alfred Golder (1927) Documents of Russian History 1914‚Äì1917. Read Books. . and he told the old Goremykin it was not right not to convene the Duma as all were trying to cooperate; one must show them a little confidence.The Complete Wartime Correspondence of Tsar Nicholas II and the Empress Alexandra. April 1914-March 1917, p. 317. By Joseph T. Fuhrmann, ed. His wish for retirement was granted at the beginning of February 1916, when he was replaced by Boris St√ºrmer. St√ºrmer was not opposed to the convening of the Duma, as Goremykin had been, and he would launch a more liberal and conciliatory politic. After the February Revolution in 1917, he was arrested and interrogated before the \\"Extraordinary Commission of Inquiry for the Investigation of Illegal Acts by Ministers and Other Responsible Persons of the Czarist Regime\\". In May Kerensky agreed to his release, on condition that he retired to his dacha in Sochi. On 24 December 1917 he was murdered in a robbery raid, together with his wife, his daughter, and father-in-law. Legacy Goremykin's conservatism and inability to function in a semi-parliamentary system made him largely unsuitable for the position of head of government during the last years of Imperial Russia. Goremykin was despised by parliamentarians and revolutionaries and personally desired only to retire, and the ineffectiveness of his last government contributed to the instability and ultimate downfall of the Romanov dynasty. Quotations Ivan Goremykin * \\"The Emperor can't see that the candles have already been lit around my coffin and that the only thing required to complete the ceremony is myself.\\" (Commenting on his advanced age and unsuitability for office.) * \\"To me, His Majesty is the anointed one, the rightful sovereign. He personifies the whole of Russia. He is forty-seven and it is not just since yesterday that he has been reigning and deciding the fate of the Russian people. When the decision of such a man is made and his course of action is determined, his faithful subjects must accept it whatever may be the consequences. And then let God's will be fulfilled.

She was known for her wealth and was named by the Guinness Book of World Records as the \\"greatest miser\\", which meant that even when being incredibly rich, she was a renowned cheapskate, as she refused to buy expensive clothes, pay for hot water, and wear a single dress, that was only washed when it was worn out. She amassed a fortune as a financier when other major financiers were men. After her death, The New York Times stated that \\"It was the fact that Mrs. Green was a woman that made her career the subject of endless curiosity, comment and astonishment.\\" Birth and early years Henrietta (\\"Hetty\\") Howland Robinson was born in 1834 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, the daughter of Edward Mott Robinson and Abby Howland, the richest whaling family in the city. Her family members were Quakers who owned a large whaling fleet and also profited from the China trade.Slack, Charles, Hetty: The Genius and Madness of America's First Female Tycoon. New York: Ecco (2004) . She had a younger brother who died as an infant. At the age of two, Hetty was sent to live with her grandfather, Gideon Howland, and her Aunt Sylvia. Hetty would read the stock quotations and commerce reports for her grandfather and picked up some of his business methods. At the age of 10, Hetty entered Eliza Wing's boarding school in Sandwich, Massachusetts. Hetty's father became the head of the Isaac Howland whaling firm upon Gideon's death, and Hetty began to emulate her father's business practices. Hetty learned to read ledgers and trade commodities. At the age of 15, Hetty enrolled for two summer sessions at the Friends Academy. Hetty also attended Anna Cabot Lowell's Finishing school, and appeared as a New Bedford debutante in 1854, before moving to New York to live with a cousin of her mother's, Henry Grinnell. Yet, it was not long before Hetty returned to New Bedford, alternating between her father's house and her aunt's house. There, as Janet Wallach states, \\"...by pursuing her father's interests she not only won his praise, she shared his pleasure in making money.\\" Because of Gideon's influence and that of her father, and possibly because her mother was constantly ill, she was close to her father and was reading financial papers to him by the age of six. When she was 13, Hetty became the family bookkeeper. Hetty accompanied her father to the countinghouses, storerooms, commodities traders, and stockbrokers. In the evening, she read him the news. Her mother, Abby Robinson, died on February 21, 1860, at the age of 51, but her $100,000 estate went to her husband, except for an $8,000 () house for Hetty. In June, Hetty's father sold off his interest in the whaling fleet and invested in William Tell Coleman's shipping firm, becoming a partner. While in New York, he also invested in government bonds, which paid 6% interest in gold. Back in New Bedford, Hetty's aunt Sylvia gave Hetty $20,000 () in stocks as a gift. While staying with her father in New York, Hetty would meet her future husband, Edward Henry Green. Edward Robinson died on June 14, 1865, leaving Hetty approximately $6 million (), which included $919,000 in cash, a warehouse in San Francisco, with the remainder in a trust fund from which she received the income. Yet she had no control over the principal. Hetty's aunt Sylvia Ann Howland also died in 1865, soon after her father. In September 1863, Sylvia Howland had willed half of her $2 million estate () to charities and entities in the town of New Bedford; the rest would be in a trust for Hetty, but once again without her control of the principal. By December, Hetty challenged the will's validity in court by producing an earlier will, made in January 1862, that left the entire estate to Hetty, and included a clause invalidating any subsequent wills. The will was challenged in court and the case, Robinson v. Mandell, which is notable as an early example of the forensic use of mathematics, was ultimately decided against Robinson after the court ruled that the clause invalidating future wills, and Sylvia's signature to it, were forgeries.Robinson v. Mandell, 20 F. Cas. 1027 (C.C.D. Mass. 1868) (No. 11,959) After five years of legal battles, Hetty was awarded a settlement of $600,000 (). Marriage Edward Henry Green of Vermont learned the business trade in Boston before working in the Far East for the next 20 years. By the age of 44, he was a partner in the Russell Styrgis & Company, and a millionaire. Yet, Hetty's father stipulated in his will that Green would not inherit Hetty's money, which was to be \\"free from the debts, control or interference of any such husband.\\" On July 11, 1867, at the age of 33, Hetty married Edward Henry Green. She made him renounce all rights to her money before the wedding. The couple moved to his home in Manhattan. When her cousins tried to have her indicted for forgery based on the Robinson v. Mandell decision, the couple moved overseas to London, where they lived in the Langham Hotel. Their two children, Edward Howland Robinson Green (called Ned) and Harriet Sylvia Ann Howland Green Wilks (called Sylvia), were born in London: Ned on August 23, 1868, and Sylvia on January 7, 1871. They separated in 1885, but remained married, and spent more time together in their later lives. Investing career Hetty followed a contrarian investing strategy, in her words, \\"I buy when things are low and nobody wants them. I keep them until they go up and people are crazy to get them. That is, I believe, the secret of all successful business.\\" Hetty invested the interest from her father's trust fund, once again investing as her father had done, in Civil War bonds, which paid a high yield in gold, augmented by railroad stocks. Her annual profits during her first year in London, amounted to $1.25 million, while the most she ever earned in a day was $200,000. Hetty went on to say, \\"I believe in getting in at the bottom and out on top. I like to buy railroad stocks or mortgage bonds. When I see a good thing going cheap because nobody wants it, I buy a lot of it and tuck it away.\\" Hetty's discounted greenbacks, bought during the Civil War, were increased in value when Congress passed legislation in 1875 backing them with gold. As Hetty said of her investing philosophy, \\"Before deciding on an investment, I seek out every kind of information about it.\\" When the Green family returned to the United States in October 1873, after Edward suffered losses on Wall Street, they settled in Edward's hometown of Bellows Falls, Vermont. Yet, Hetty quarreled with Edward's mother, until her death in 1875. That same year, Hetty covered Edward's losses associated with the London and San Francisco Bank, of which he was one of the directors. Hetty bailed Edward out once again in 1884. After the 1885 collapse of the financial house John J. Cisco & Son, of which Edward was a partner, it was disclosed Edward had $700,000 in debt. Hetty Green's $500,000 represented one-quarter of the banks's assets. The bank refused to allow Hetty's transfer of her $26 million in stocks, bonds, mortgages, and deeds to the Chemical National Bank, until Edward's debt was paid. In the end, Hetty made the transfer and paid off her husband's debt, but never forgave Edward. Hetty set up an office in the Chemical Bank, but continued to live in boarding houses, flats, or hotels. By then she was known as the \\"Queen of Wall Street.\\" Hetty's investing philosophy, in her words, included, \\"In business generally, don't close a bargain until you have reflected on it overnight.\\" She also thought, \\"It is the duty of every woman, I believe, to learn to take care of her own business affairs,\\" and \\"A girl should be brought up as to be able to make her own living...\\" \\"Whether rich or poor, a young woman should know how a bank account works, understand the composition of mortgages and bonds, and know the value of interest and how it accumulates.\\" Reputation Hetty Green circa 1905 Green's thriftiness was legendary. She was said never to turn on the heat or use hot water. She wore one old black dress and undergarments that she changed only after they had been worn out; she did not wash her hands and she rode in an old carriage. She ate mostly pies that cost fifteen cents. One tale claims that Green spent half a night searching her carriage for a lost stamp worth two cents. Another asserts that she instructed her laundress to wash only the dirtiest parts of her dresses (the hems) to save money on soap.\\"Wait Wait Don't Tell Me\\", NPR radio program, episode of April 3, 2010 Yet, from Hetty's perspective, \\"Just because I dress plainly and do not spend a fortune on my gowns, they say I am cranky or insane.\\" Green conducted much of her business at the offices of the Seaboard National Bank in New York, surrounded by trunks and suitcases full of her papers; she did not want to pay rent for her own office. Later unfounded rumors claimed that she ate only oatmeal, heated on the office radiator. Possibly because of her usually dour dress (due mainly to frugality, but perhaps in part related to her Quaker upbringing), she was given the nickname \\"the Witch of Wall Street\\".The Miser Hurts No One But Herself, 24/08/2007, Jeffrey A. Tucker, Mises Institute: \\"she was called \\"the witch of Wall Street.\\"\\" She was a successful businesswoman who dealt mainly in real estate, invested in railroads and mines, and lent money while acquiring numerous mortgages. The City of New York came to Green for loans to keep the city afloat on several occasions, most particularly during the Panic of 1907; she wrote a check for $1.1 million and took her payment in short-term revenue bonds. Keenly detail-oriented, she would travel thousands of miles alone‚Äîin an era when few women would dare travel unescorted‚Äîto collect a debt of a few hundred dollars. Green entered the lexicon of turn-of-the-century America with the popular phrase \\"I'm not Hetty if I do look green.\\" O. Henry used this phrase in his 1890s story \\"The Skylight Room\\" when a young woman, negotiating the rent on a room in a rooming house owned by an imperious old lady, wishes to make it clear she is neither as rich as she appears nor as naive. Her frugality extended to family life. Her son Ned had to suffer a leg amputation, because she delayed so long in looking for a free clinic that his case became incurable. She was wealthy, yet she chose to live like a pauper. In Hetty's words, \\"I don't think society means what some rich people would have us believe, I should get very tired of living in one of the great houses in New York, going out all night and sleeping all day. They don't have any real pleasure. It's intercourse with people that I like.\\" Yet she was also a secret philanthropist, avoiding the attention of the press. In her words, \\"I believe in discreet charity.\\" Hetty also had the reputation of being an effective nurse, caring for her young and old neighbors. Her favorite poem was William Henry Channing's \\"My Symphony,\\" which starts with \\"To live content with small means...\\" Later life As a young man, Ned moved away from his mother to manage the family's properties in Chicago and, later, Texas. In middle age, he returned to New York; his mother lived her final months with him. Green's daughter Sylvia lived with her mother until her thirties. Hetty Green disapproved of all of her daughter's suitors, suspecting that they were after her fortune. Sylvia finally married Matthew Astor Wilks on February 23, 1909, after a two-year courtship. A minor heir to the Astor fortune, Wilks entered the marriage with $2 million of his own, enough to assure Green that he was not a gold digger. Nonetheless, she compelled him to sign a prenuptial agreement waiving his right to inherit Sylvia's fortune. When her grown children left home, Green moved repeatedly among small apartments in Brooklyn Heights and after 1898, in Hoboken, New Jersey, mainly to avoid New York's property tax, though she did loan money to the city at reasonable rates. Hetty then regularly commuted to her office in the Chemical Bank on Broadway. By 1905, Hetty was New York's largest lender. Green's apartment was not heated and her diet consisted of eggs, onions, and dry oatmeal.Felton, Bruce; Fowler, Mark. (1994). The Best, Worst, and Most Unusual: Noteworthy Achievements, Events, Feats & Blunders of Every Conceivable Kind. Galahad Books. pp. 198-199. She did not eat hot food because it would have increased her fuel bill. In her old age, she developed a hernia, but refused to have an operation, preferring to use a stick to press down the swelling. She eventually moved her office to the National Park Bank, when she thought she had been poisoned at the Chemical Bank, a fear she had most of her life. Death On July 3, 1916, Hetty Green died at age 81 at her son's New York City home. According to her longstanding \\"World's Greatest Miser\\" entry in the Guinness Book of World Records, she died of apoplexy after arguing with a maid over the virtues of skimmed milk. The New York Times reported she suffered a series of strokes leading up to her death. Upon her death, Hetty was known as the \\"Wizard of Finance\\" and the \\"Richest Woman in America.\\" Estimates of her net worth ranged from $100 million to $200 million (equivalent to $ to $ in ), making her arguably the richest woman in the world at the time. She was buried in Bellows Falls, Vermont, next to her husband. She had converted late in life to his Episcopalian faith so that she could be interred with him. Their two children split her estate, which included a ten-year trust for Sylvia administered by Ed. They were reported to have enjoyed their wealth more than she had. Both notably came through the Great Depression relatively unscathed by following Hetty's philosophy of conservative buying backed by substantial cash reserves. Ned was an accomplished collector with interests in everything from auto racing to science to horticulture. After his death, his sister Sylvia, as heir, donated his Round Hill, Massachusetts estate in 1948 to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which used the property for experimentation. These included a prototype atom smasher. They used his powerful WMAF radio transmitters to keep in touch with Richard E. Byrd's 1928-1930 Antarctic expedition. Sylvia died in 1951, leaving an estimated $200 million and donating all but $1,388,000 to 64 colleges, churches, hospitals, and other charities. Both children were buried near their parents in Bellows Falls., Stevens College See also * Countess Annie Leary * Business magnate * Collyer brothers, New York City misers and hoarders Trivia The She-Wolf (1931) and ‚Äò‚ÄôYou Can‚Äôt Buy Everything‚Äô‚Äô (1934) was the story of a miserly millionaire businesswoman based on the real-life miser Hetty Green.

The independent label distributor Fontana Distribution takes its name from the label. History Fontana started in the 1950s as a subsidiary of the Dutch Philips Records; when Philips restructured its music operations, it dropped Fontana in favor of Vertigo Records. 1960s U.S. Fontana 45-rpm record of \\"Winchester Cathedral\\" by the New Vaudeville Band, one of four U.S. Fontana singles that topped the Billboard charts Fontana's U.S. counterpart label was started in 1964 and distributed by Philips US subsidiary Mercury Records. The initial single release (F 1501) was a wild teen beat instrumental by famed British session drummer Bobby Graham, both sides featuring Jimmy Page on guitar. Among the hitmakers were Wayne Fontana & the Mindbenders (then on their own simply as the Mindbenders), the Troggs, the New Vaudeville Band and Steam, all of whom had No. 1 hits on the label. Other successful Fontana artists included Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich, the Silkie, Nana Mouskouri, the Pretty Things, the Herd, Gloria Lynne and the duo of Jane Birkin & Serge Gainsbourg. The label also served as an outlet for other British acts such as the Merseybeats, the Others, Eden Kane, the Escorts and Sight & Sound. In some cases, Fontana was early on artists who achieved greater fame and fortune with subsequent releases for other labels, like the Spencer Davis Group, the Guess Who, Don Partridge and Helen Reddy. Notably, in 1964, a group calling themselves The High Numbers released their first single, \\"I'm The Face\\"/\\"Zoot Suit.\\" They achieved worldwide success after changing labels and management, and changing their name to The Who. It was also an outlet for some of the productions James Brown recorded under his deal with sister label Smash Records including Vicki Anderson. Mercury discontinued the label (and one other subsidiary, Smash Records) in 1970. Fontana's British division was the UK licensee for Motown Records (in 1961), Columbia Records and Epic Records (until 1962), Vanguard Records (until 1967), Mainstream Records and ESP-Disk. As with Philips, labels were blue for singles, black for EPs and LPs. In 1972, PolyGram acquired the dormant label. In the UK and Europe, the Fontana label was largely dormant after 1974, although in 1980-81 it was used for releases by Sector 27 and Dennis Bovell. Fontana was revived in the 1980s as an outlet for acts such as Tears for Fears, the Teardrop Explodes, Pere Ubu, Cocteau Twins and Swing Out Sister, and was active in the 1990s, releasing music for acts such as House of Love, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, Ocean Colour Scene, Oleta Adams and James. It is currently an active division of Fontana Distribution, using the same logo. The label's only artists as of March 2013 are Brooke Hogan and Papoose.

Family background and early life Cole was the son of British Army officer William Utting Cole, a major in the 3rd Dragoon Guards who died of cholera in India when his son was a child. His mother, Mary de Vere, was niece and heiress of Sir Stephen and Lady de Vere. Cole was a great-nephew of the Anglo-Irish poet Aubrey de Vere. Horace's paternal grandfather had made his fortune dealing in quinine, while his mother's family claimed kinship with the de Vere Earls of Oxford and the right to the position of Lord Great Chamberlain of England. A bout of diphtheria at the age of ten seriously affected his hearing for the remainder of his life. A few years later he was sent as a boarder to Eton College. During the Second Boer War, Cole was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Yorkshire Hussars, in which he quickly rose to the rank of acting captain. He was wounded by a dumdum bullet on 2 July 1900 and recuperated from shrapnel wounds at the Red Cross hospital in Kroonstad until September that year. He was subsequently invalided out of the army, donating the ¬£1800 he received from cashing in his disability pension to the fund for war widows and orphans. On his return to England he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1902, although he did not complete his degree. When his paternal grandmother, Jane, died in 1906 Cole inherited, inter alia, West Woodhay House in the parish of West Woodhay in southern Berkshire. He was unable to afford the upkeep and in 1912 sold the property to his uncle, Alfred Clayton Cole, who later became Governor of the Bank of England. Pranks Abyssinian regalia; from left, Virginia Stephen (later Virginia Woolf, seated), Duncan Grant, Horace, Adrian Stephen, Anthony Buxton (seated), Guy Ridley. As an undergraduate at Cambridge, Cole posed as the uncle of the Sultan of Zanzibar‚Äîwho was visiting London at the time‚Äîto make a ceremonial visit to his own college, accompanied by his friend Adrian Stephen (the brother of Virginia Woolf).Martyn Downer, The Sultan of Zanzibar: The Bizarre World and Spectacular Hoaxes of Horace de Vere Cole (London: Black Spring Press, 2010, ), p. 44 Cole's best-known trick was the Dreadnought hoax on 7 February 1910, when he fooled the captain of the Royal Navy warship HMS Dreadnought into taking him and a group of his friends, including Virginia Woolf, for an official Abyssinian delegation. On occasion, Cole would wander the streets with a cow's udder poking through the fly of his trousers; once he judged he had caused optimum outrage he would cut off the offending protrusion with a pair of scissors. On honeymoon with his first wife in Italy, on April Fools' Day 1919, Cole dropped horse manure onto Venice's Piazza San Marco‚Äîa city with no horses that could be reached only by boat. Spending most of his later life in London, Cole executed a series of bold jokes and escapades principally aimed at deflating pompous figures of authority. His targets included members of parliament, city businessmen, and naval officers. On one occasion he directed a group of like-minded friends dressed as workmen as they dug a trench across Piccadilly. On another, he challenged an old schoolfriend from Eton, the newly elected Conservative Member of Parliament Oliver Locker- Lampson, to race him on a London street to the nearest corner, giving him a 10-yard head start. Cole had already slipped his gold watch into his friend‚Äôs pocket, and with Locker-Lampson running ahead at full speed Cole waited till they were passing a policeman and began to yell \\"Stop thief!\\" Locker-Lampson was promptly arrested and the watch found. After savouring the moment, Cole explained that it was all a joke, and both men were told to go on their way. Unfortunately, Cole then began waving his stick in a dangerous manner, as though conducting an imaginary band, and both men were arrested and taken into custody. No charge was brought against Locker-Lampson, but Cole was found guilty of a breach of the peace and fined ¬£5. According to legend, Cole once hosted a party at which the guests discovered that they all had the word \\"bottom\\" in their surnames. According to another story he bought tickets for particular seats at a theatrical performance he considered pretentious and distributed them to eight bald men whose heads, painted with a single letter, spelled out the word \\"B-O-L-L-O-C-K-S\\" (another source claims it was four men's heads making the word F-U-C-K), which was legible from the circle and boxes above. With his mane of hair and bristling moustache, in the 1920s Cole was sometimes mistaken for the Labour prime minister Ramsay MacDonald, causing dismay when Cole launched into a fierce public attack on Labour. His sister Annie married the future Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who was asked by Annie what he thought of Cole, and later commented \\"I was obliged to say what I did think, but fortunately it appeared that was her opinion too and she was not at all inclined to be proud of her brother's exploit... I think he must be a little mad.\\" Cole has also been suspected of the Piltdown Man hoax. Personal life In 1918 Cole fell in love with the eighteen-year-old Irish heiress Denise Lynch. Owing to the fortune she stood to inherit, she was a ward of the Irish Chancery and prevented from marrying until the age of 21. Lynch was eventually released from the wardship and married Cole on 30September 1918 in Dublin. She subsequently gave birth to a daughter, Valerie, but the marriage failed in 1928 and he went into voluntary exile in France, after losing all his money in Canadian land speculation. In 1931 he married a former scullery maid and waitress at the Veeraswamy Indian restaurant, Mabel Winifred Mary Wright (later Mavis Wheeler, 1908-1970) who in 1935 gave birth to a son, Tristan de Vere Cole, who was the natural son of the artist Augustus John. Cole died of a heart attack in Honfleur, France the following year and was buried at West Woodhay. Mabel later married the archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler, who afterwards divorced her on the grounds of her adultery with Lord Vivian.

He was born in Torquay, England and had a brother, Dale. When his family moved to France, he went to school in Wimereux, Pas-de-Calais. Back in Britain in 1932, he studied at the Ipswich School of Art. Second World War years Stonehouse worked as an artist but joined the Territorial Army after the outbreak of World War II. He was later conscripted into the Royal Artillery. In 1940, he worked as an interpreter for French troops in Glasgow who had been evacuated from Norway. In the autumn of 1941, he was training for a commission in the 121 Officer Cadet Unit when the Special Operations Executive contacted him. Due to his fluency in French, SOE recruited him as a wireless operator with code name of Celestin. On 1 July 1942, Stonehouse parachuted into occupied France near the city of Tours in the Loire Valley. His radio got caught in a tree and he spent five nights in the forest before he could get it down. After finally retrieving it, the radio would not work properly and his contact told him to move to Lyon. In September, accompanied by another agent, Blanche Charlet, he went to a safe house and made contact with the other SOE agents. By August he was in regular contact with the SOE station in London. However he became careless and transmitted too much and too long. As a result, German direction-finders triangulated his position and the Milice arrested him on 24 October 1942 in near Lyon. Charlet was also captured but later managed to escape to London. After the war Stonehouse discovered that Charlet had tried to commit suicide. In Castres prison, the Gestapo placed Stonehouse in solitary confinement while subjecting him to frequent and brutal interrogations. In December he was transferred to Fresnes prison in Paris and further interrogated. Eventually he was shipped to Germany with other SOE prisoners, including Albert Guerisse, GC, the Pat O'Leary Line organiser, and Guerisse's Australian W/T operator, Tom Groome. In October 1943, they arrived in Saarbr√ºcken and in November was sent to Mauthausen concentration camp. He spent a brief time in a Luftwaffe factory camp in Vienna. In mid-1944, he was transferred to the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp in Alsace with Guerisse, a.k.a. Pat O'Leary. Stonehouse saved his own life by drawing sketches for the camp commandant, guards and their families. Throughout his time in five prisons, Stonehouse kept his personal vow of never painting or drawing an officer in uniform. At the camp he witnessed the arrival of four female SOE agents, Andr√©e Borrel, Vera Leigh, Diana Rowden and Sonya Olschanezky, who were all executed and disposed of in the crematorium to make them disappear without a trace, under the programme of \\"Nacht und Nebel\\" (\\"Night and Fog\\"). After the war, Stonehouse and Guerisse were able to testify at the Nazi war crimes trials as to the women's fate. In 1985, Stonehouse painted a poignant watercolour of the four women from memory which now hangs in the Special Forces Club in London. From Natzweiler-Struthof, Stonehouse was sent to the Dachau concentration camp from where he was liberated by U.S. troops on 29 April 1945. At home, he was created a military MBE. After the war, he remained in the military and was promoted to captain while working for the Allied Control Commission in Frankfurt, Germany where he assisted with the interrogation of Gestapo and SS members.

In 1979, he returned to Britain and became a portrait painter. His clients included members of the Royal family. One of his last portraits of The Queen Mother, who sat for him many times, still hangs in the Special Forces Club in London. During his final years Stonehouse was an active Theosophist living at the London branch of the United Lodge of Theosophists. Brian Stonehouse's art Whilst operating in France Stonehouse continued to sketch and draw people he came across. He was on several occasions told not to carry his sketch books with him whilst 'on duty' (Interview with his surviving brother, May 2007). Throughout his times in various prisons he continued to draw, at first secretly, but after discovery more openly. His collections of drawings of fellow SOE prisoners, life in prison and prison guards along with other personal artefacts was handed over by the Stonehouse Family to the Imperial War Museum London in May 2007. These included, as well as the War Art, for example, postwar letters from surviving SOE operatives and letters and photographs from US President Dwight D. Eisenhower. This last collection included a signed photograph and note from Eisenhower upon meeting Stonehouse again shortly after the war ended. This stated that upon meeting each other again, Stonehouse asked Eisenhower if he knew why he had survived the war. The response from Eisenhower was, \\"I was going to ask you that\\". Moyse's Hall Museum Bury St Edmunds discovered and facilitated the handing over of the collections following a VE Day (Victory in Europe Day)/VJ day (Victory over Japan Day) exhibition, to which the family had bought Brian's art and other personal artefacts. A series of exhibitions of Stonehouse's fashion work was held at the Abbott and Holder gallery in London in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.

No birth certificate exists to confirm her age, and it has been reported with significant disparity, although she claimed in newspaper interviews that she was born Ruby Macie Grayer on March 20, 1897.

Her mother, born in 1889, died when she was very young, and she was raised by a woman she called her aunt, although she would later say that this woman was probably not her biological aunt. She did not know her father until she was a teenager. Community records in Sandersville, where she was born, indicate her father died at age 107 and her great-grandfather died at age 110.

Biography Carr√© was born in Le Creusot, Sa√¥ne-et-Loire. In the 1930s she attended Sorbonne University and became a teacher. After her marriage, she moved to Algeria with her husband Maurice Carr√©, who was later killed in World War II, during the campaign of Italy. She returned to France, worked as a nurse and witnessed the country fall to the Germans. In 1940, she met a Polish Air Force Captain named Roman Czerniawski cryptonymed \\"Walenty\\" to the Poles and \\"Armand\\" or \\"Victor\\" to the French. Carr√©, who had contacts with the Vichy Second Bureau, joined the headquarters section of his Franco- Polish Interalli√© espionage network based in Paris under the cryptonym \\"Victoire\\" (as all the headquarters section staff had \\"V\\" initial names, in a network which named its agents and their sectors or areas of coverage for Christian names grouped by the letters of the alphabet) although nicknamed La Chatte, (\\"The She-cat\\") for her feline predatory and stealthy propensities. On 17 November 1941, the Abwehr's Hugo Bleicher arrested Czerniawski, Carr√© and many other members of Interalli√©; they had been uncovered when an informant in Normandy had been exposed to the Gestapo. She was interrogated by him, threatened with death and also offered financial reward, before agreeing to become a double agent herself and revealed all of the members of the network known to her. She began to work for Germans continuing to use the code name Victoire. She may also have become Bleicher's mistress. According to Pierre de Vom√©court, an agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), he and a Resistance contact began to suspect her. When he confronted Carr√©, who had become his mistress, she confessed and together they planned to outwit the Abwehr. She claimed she convinced Bleicher, and through him, his superiors, to send her to London to infiltrate the SOE. In February 1942, she was exfiltrated to London with de Vom√©court via a naval vessel from a cove in Locquirec.Peter Jacobs. \\"Setting France Ablaze: The SOE in France During WWII\\", Pen and Sword, 30 September 2015, p. 36; retrieved 11 February 2017. MI5 interrogated her about Abwehr techniques and played back her radio link for a period until her usefulness was exhausted, whereupon she was arrested and taken first to HM Prison Holloway and then to HM Prison Aylesbury for the rest of the war, where she acted as an informant against other detainees. After the war, Carr√© was deported to France where she faced charges for treason. At the trial, which started on 3 January 1949, the prosecution read from her diary: \\"What I wanted most was a good meal, a man, and, once more, Mozart's Requiem.\\"Time: La Chatte Despite being defended by her wartime commander, Paul Archard, she was sentenced to death on 7 January 1949.

Early life and WWI  Hugo Ernst Bleicher was born in Tettnang on 9 August 1899. He served as a private soldier in the First World War in the pioneer gas corps and was captured near the Somme. He was held as a Prisoner of War in 165 POW Camp near Abbeville and succeeded in escaping four times, although he was never able to return to the German lines. He is misreported as having been taken prisoner by the British in Belgium as a spy when wearing a British uniform. After the war he became a businessman.  WWII  Bleicher was recruited into the Abwehr during the Second World War because of his knowledge of French and Spanish, however, he never rose above the rank of Feldwebel (equivalent to Sergeant). He was ruthless in his pursuit of anyone in France who opposed German domination. He disabled the Franco-Polish \\"Interalli√©\\" network, and captured both Polish Air Force Captain Roman Czerniawski and some of his headquarters staff, one of whom was Mathilde Carr√©, who had contacts with the Vichy 2nd Bureau. She reportedly became Bleicher's lover, betrayed everyone she knew in the network, and agreed to act as an Abwehr agent. Subsequently, she changed sides again and betrayed her dealings with the Abwehr to MI5, who used her radio link for deception purposes for a period in conjunction with the Poles and the SIS and then imprisoned her when her usefulness had ceased, until the end of the war. In March 1943, Bleicher arrested Andr√© Marsac, a member of the resistance organisation known as Carte. Masquerading, on his own initiative, as a German intelligence colonel attempting to defect to the Allies, he deceived Marsac and his associate Roger Bardet, and persuaded Bardet to work for him as a double agent.

Bardet also betrayed Henri Frager, another former Carte member who had been commissioned by the SOE as leader of its Donkeyman circuit, whom Bleicher arrested in July 1944, and Frager was subsequently executed. He was also associated with SOE agent Henri Dericourt (Farrier), who was also a double agent for the Sicherheitsdienst.  Postwar  Hugo Bleicher, together with two of his French Abwehr agents Jean Rocquefort and Francois Barbier, was arrested in Amsterdam on 15 May 1945 by the Dutch NBS, who interrogated him for two weeks on his activities in the Netherlands before handing him over to the First Canadian Army, who interrogated him for a further period, also on his operations in the Netherlands, before handing him over to the British authorities, who transferred him on 16 June 1945 to the UK for longer term interrogation at Camp 020. He was handed over to the French government on 12 October 1945, and they subsequently placed him on trial and imprisoned him, as they also did with Mathilde Carr√©. While imprisoned in Paris he met Bardet and told him he had planned to assassinate him on one occasion as Bardet knew too much against him. In 1954, he published his memoirs, Colonel Henri's story. Bleicher (sometimes misreported as Bliechert) actively employed the aliases Jean Verbeck and Colonel Henri (often misreported as Colonel Heinrich). He held, but never used, identity papers in the name of Jean Castel. He landed in the UK under the Canadian supplied alias of Charles Davidson, and has been misreported as using the names von Stahlen, Henri Bothereau or Gottschalk. He was decorated by the Abwehr with the War Merit Cross 1st Class for his services.  Bibliography  * Colonel Henri's story : the war memoirs of Hugo Bleicher former German secret agent.

The label flourished in the 1940s and 1950s, notably for its rhythm and blues (R&B;) and early rock and roll recordings. Early recordings on the label covered a range of styles including R&B;, gospel, jazz, and polka. The first singles on the label included some by the vocal group the Four Blues (who also recorded gospel as the Golden Echo Quartet), Billy Eckstine, and Benny Carter.John Broven, Record Makers and Breakers: Voices of the Independent Rock 'n' Roll Pioneers, University of Illinois Press, 2009, p. 142 In 1947, the Braun brothers went to New Orleans seeking new talent, and discovered and signed bandleaders Paul Gayten and Dave Bartholomew, and singers Roy Brown and Annie Laurie. Brown had a national R&B; hit the following year with \\"Good Rocking Tonight\\", a notable precursor of rock and roll. Several of the label's other New Orleans-based musicians also achieved success. Recording studio owner Cosimo Matassa said that the Braun brothers were the first talent scouts to go to New Orleans to record local musicians commercially.John Broven, Rhythm & Blues in New Orleans, Pelican, 1974, p. 17, In 1947, Syd Nathan, the founder and owner of King Records, purchased a majority interest in DeLuxe. The Braun brothers then set up another label, Regal Records. In 1949, Nathan moved the DeLuxe label to Cincinnati, Ohio and in 1951, after a bitter legal battle, he bought out the Braun brothers. Otis Williams and the Charms, The Manhattans and Donnie Elbert were among artists who recorded R&B; hits for DeLuxe from the mid-1950s to the early 1970s.

He came from a family of decayed nobility, and worked in the service of exiled royalists who returned to England under King Charles II. Little else is known of his history. According to popular legend, he abhorred violence, showing courtesy to his victims and chivalry to their womenfolk, thus spawning the myth of the romantic highwayman, as taken up by many novelists and playwrights. Early life Claude Duvall was born in Domfront, Orne, Normandy in 1643 to a noble family stripped of title and land. His origin and parentage are in dispute. He did, however, have a brother, Daniel DuVal. At the age of 14 he was sent to Paris where he worked as a domestic servant. He later became a stable boy for a group of English royalists and moved to England in the time of the English Restoration as a footman of the Duke of Richmond (possibly a relation) and rented a house in Wokingham. Highwayman The legend goes that before long, Duval became a successful highwayman who robbed the passing stagecoaches on the roads to London, especially Holloway between Highgate and Islington and, that unlike most other highwaymen, he distinguished himself with rather gentlemanly behaviour and fashionable clothes. He reputedly never used violence. One of his victims was Squire Roper, Master of the Royal Buckhounds, whom he relieved of 50 guineas and tied to a tree. There are many tales about Duval. A particularly famous one ‚Äî placed in more than one location and later published by William Pope ‚Äî claims that he took only a part of his potential loot from a gentleman, when the man's wife agreed to dance the \\"courante\\" with him in the wayside, a scene immortalised by William Powell Frith in his 1860 painting Claude Duval. If his intention was to deter pursuit by his non-threatening behaviour, he did not totally succeed. After the authorities promised a large reward, he fled to France for some time but returned a few months later. Shortly afterwards, he is said to have been arrested in the Hole-in-the-Wall tavern in London's Chandos Street, Covent Garden. Execution On 17 January 1670, judge Sir William Morton found him guilty of six robberies (others remained unproven) and sentenced him to death. Despite many attempts to intercede, the king did not pardon him and he was executed on 21 January at Tyburn. When his body was cut down and exhibited in Tangier Tavern, it drew a large crowd. It is traditionally thought Du Val was buried under the centre aisle of the church of St Paul's, Covent Garden; the parish register notes the burial of a \\"Peter Duval\\" in January 1670. A memorial at the church reads: :Here lies DuVall: Reder, if male thou art, :Look to thy purse; if female, to thy heart. :Much havoc has he made of both; for all :Men he made to stand, and women he made to fall :The second Conqueror of the Norman race, :Knights to his arm did yield, and ladies to his face. :Old Tyburn‚Äôs glory; England‚Äôs illustrious Thief, :Du Vall, the ladies‚Äô joy; Du Vall, the ladies‚Äô grief. The apparently gallant highwayman inspired a number of biographers and playwrights to add to his legend, including claims of alchemy, gambling, and much womanising. He is reported to haunt the Holt Hotel along the A4260 (Oxford Road) in Oxfordshire, a hotel where he spent many nights when it was a small coaching inn.Haunted Hotel Guide Popular culture Recent historians have reappraised the legacy of Duval. James Sharpe in Dick Turpin regarded Duval as the most significant figure in the shaping of the highwayman myth. John and Philip Sugden's The Thief of Hearts reconstructs what is known of the historical Duval, using much fresh evidence, and shows that the traditions about the Frenchman were used by such literary luminaries as Samuel Butler (A Pindarick Ode), John Gay (The Beggar's Opera) and William Harrison Ainsworth (Rookwood and Talbot Harland) to create the iconic image of the gentleman highwayman still beloved today. * A 2005 Travel Channel Haunted Hotels documentary on hauntings claims that Claude Duval's ghost presently haunts the tavern wherein he was arrested before being condemned to death. This same documentary also claims several people were murdered by Duval, despite scant evidence. * A comic opera called Claude Duval was written in 1881 by Edward Solomon and Henry Pottinger Stephens and enjoyed success both in Britain and in America. * In Mary Hooper's book The Remarkable Life and Times of Eliza Rose, Duval is said to be a friend of Nell Gwyn and is credited with saving King Charles II of England's life. * \\"As he reached this spot, a man started from the obscurity, and requested with the politeness of a Claude Duval to know the time.\\" From Mountains and Molehills; or, Recollections of a Burnt Journal, 1855, by Francis Samuel Marryat, (1826‚Äì1855). * A public house in the town of Camberley in Surrey is named in his honour. * He was the subject of London Dungeon exhibition in May 2015. * Is a subject in the podcast radio-play Adventures of Sage & Savant Episode 206 * Michelle Lowe's novel, Cherished Thief, published in 2012, depicts Claude DuVal's entire life story.

Gazan started his military career as a cannonier in the French Coast Guard. He was later appointed to the Royal Life Guards and, upon the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789, he joined the French National Guard. After service in the Upper Rhine valley and the Netherlands, he joined Andr√© Mass√©na in Switzerland in 1799, and fought at the battles of Winterthur and First Zurich. In August 1805, Gazan commanded of a division of the Army that encircled the Austrians in Ulm. On November 11, under Joseph Mortier, his division provided the advance guard in the advance on Vienna. Mortier over- extended his line of march and Gazan's division was surrounded by Kutuzov's Coalition army; Gazan lost 40 percent of his force in the Battle of D√ºrenstein. Following the Prussian defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt, he transferred with Jean Lannes to the Iberian peninsula. There he participated in the French capture of Zaragoza and in several important actions of the long Peninsular War, including the Battle of Albuera and the Battle of Vitoria. During the Hundred Days, Gazan eventually joined Napoleon's cause, although he did not have a field command. In 1815, he judged Michel Ney's trial for treason, but refused to reach a verdict. He dabbled briefly, and unsuccessfully, in politics in the 1820s. In 1830, he was raised to the French peerage and held a divisional command in Marsailles, but by then was an old man, and he retired in 1832. He died in 1845. Family and early military career Gazan was born in the small town of Grasse, in the Alpes-Maritimes. His father, a lawyer, sent him to the College of Sor√®ze, where he received military training. Gazan was a second lieutenant in the Coast Guard cannoniers of Antibes at the age of fifteen. In 1786, he was appointed to the Royal Life Guards, Company √âcossaise.

Afterward he also joined the Freemasons.Natalia Griffon de Pleineville. General Gazan de la Peyriere (History Today, April 2003). French Revolutionary Wars At the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, Gazan returned to Grasse and joined the National Guard. In 1790, he became a captain and, in 1791, a lieutenant colonel of the local volunteer battalion of the Var. In 1792, with the declaration of war with Austria, he was sent to the 27th Regiment. His regiment first served garrison duty in Strasbourg, but in December 1793, participated in the Battle of Wissembourg. In May 1794, Gazan became a battalion commander of the new 54th Demi-Brigade. On 4 July, he routed the Prussians in Kuppenheim by ordering his drummers to beat a charge, convincing the Prussians that they were outnumbered. He was promoted to brigade colonel on 11 July and led his troops to victory against the Prussians at Trippstadt.Pleineville, General Gazan de la Peyriere. In 1796, he joined the Army of the Rhine, under the command of Jean Victor Moreau. This was his first campaign and he was promoted to brigadier general in recognition of his outstanding achievements at the Battle of Ettlingen. Gazan was wounded on 22 November 1796 and taken to hospital in Strasbourg for his recovery, where he met Marie Madeleine Reiss; after their marriage, she frequently accompanied him on his campaigns and they had several children. =Swiss campaign= On 4 April 1799, his superior and friend Andr√© Mass√©na transferred him to the Army of the Danube, at that time located in the northeastern Swiss plateau. There, he took command of a weak (under-manned) brigade at the small town of Winterthur, in northern Switzerland. On 26 May, Michel Ney, the newly appointed general of division, took command of the forward line protecting the main French force at Z√ºrich. The following day, Friedrich, Baron von Hotze, arrived with close to 8,000 battle-hardened and experienced Austrian border troops, including the 12th Infantry Manfredini, a battalion of Hungarian grenadiers, and six squadrons of the Waldeck Dragoons.Smith. \\"Winterthur.\\" Databook, p. 156‚Äì157. In the ensuing clash, Ney ordered Gazan's under-manned brigade to the center, where it was soon overwhelmed. In retreat, they safely crossed a bridge spanning a small river, the T√∂ss, but the cavalry guarding the bridge was itself forced back. After stationing his batteries on a slight incline, to protect the retreat from the Austrians, the injured Ney handed command to Gazan, who organized and conducted the successful retreat.Lawrence Shadwell. Mountain warfare illustrated by the campaign of 1799 in Switzerland: being a translation of the Swiss narrative, compiled from the works of the Archduke Charles, Jomini, and other.... London: Henry S. King, 1875. pp. 108‚Äì109. A few days later, at the First Battle of Z√ºrich (4 June 1799), the Austrian force overpowered the French lines. As part of the V. Division of the Army of the Danube, Gazan again commanded the rear guard after Massena's force disengaged from Archduke Charles' army and withdrew across the Limmat river. Later that year, he faced a combined Austrian and Russian force at the Second Battle of Z√ºrich (27 September). His division repulsed Russian outposts at the Limmat river. He subsequently participated in the wild pursuit of the Austrians, resulting in a decisive French victory. He was promoted to division commander and continued in the campaign against Coalition troops in Switzerland.Muli√©. 'Biographie des c√©l√©brit√©s militaires...; Smith, \\"Second Zurich,\\" Databook. p. 167. In 1800, Gazan accompanied the Mass√©na's Army of Italy, as a general of division in the Corps of Jean-de-Dieu Soult. The 1st Division included the Grenadiers Piedmontais, the 30th Legne (light infantry), and portions of the 2nd, 3rd, and 78th Regiments Ligne (line infantry), totaling approximately 4,500 men.Smith, \\"French Orders of Battle, 1800.\\" Databook. p. 177. While Soult's Corps campaigned in central northern Italy, Mass√©na was besieged in Genoa by an Austrian army of 24,000 and a British naval squadron. Soult moved his Corps to the east to relieve Genoa. As part of Soult's Corps, Gazan participated in the battle at Bocchetta Pass (9 April ), where he commanded the right wing, and again at the battle of Sassello (10 April). In both clashes, his division was outnumbered nearly three to one took heavy casualties French had heavy casualties. Later in the month, he participated in the clash at Voltri (18 April 1800).Smith, Databook. pp. 178‚Äì181. To relieve Mass√©na at Genoa, Soult organized several assaults on strong Austrian positions around the city. At Montecreto (13 May 1800), Gazan's division and the first column of Soult's main force (approximately 5,000 men), attacked a stronger Austrian position of 7,000, under command of Prince Hohenzollern. Soult was taken prisoner, General of Brigade Joseph Perrin was killed, and the cavalry commander, Jean-Joseph Gauthier, was badly wounded. The defeat could be seen from the ramparts at Genoa and caused the French garrison's morale to plummet; many units were already near mutiny and food was scarce.Smith, \\"Monte Creto.\\" Databook. p. 183. Gazan, who had been wounded, took his troops to Lozano and joined Louis Gabriel Suchet. There he commanded a division of the Army of Italy and fought in a French victory at the battle in Pozzolo (25 December) against the Austrians. He was appointed commander of the First Subdivision of the 27th Military Division in Piedmont. After the peace in 1801, Gazan returned home, but shortly after his return, received a new assignment as commander of a brigade in northern Italy, where he stayed until the declaration of the First French Empire in 1804. Service during the Napoleonic Wars =D√ºrrenstein and Jena= General Gazan at the battle of D√ºrenstein, 11 November 1805, by Charles N√®gre. In the War of the Third Coalition, Gazan initially was assigned as a division commander of Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e in Lille, in preparation for the planned invasion of England; he remained there until the idea was abandoned. In August 1805, Gazan commanded of a division of the army that encircled Austrians in Ulm. On November 11, under Marshal Mortier, his division provided the advance guard in the march against Kutuzov's army. As they advanced through a narrow Danube canyon, the division was isolated from the main force, near D√ºrenstein. By the small village on the Danube, famous as the prison of Richard the Lionhearted at the end of the twelfth century, he and his division were trapped in a narrow canyon, attacked by a Russian force at his rear and more Russians at his front. Gazan's division fought desperately for a harrowing day and suffered 40 percent casualties. He and Mortier were finally rescued by the arrival of the VIII. Corps' 1st Division, commanded by Pierre Dupont de l'√âtang, but only after the loss of nearly 4,000 men.Archibald Alison, Sir.

When Austria sued for peace, Gazan's division was sent to W√ºrzburg in Bavaria, where it remained until Prussia declared war in October 1806. Gazan's division fought in the French victory over Prussia at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt (14 October 1806). At Ostrolenka (16 February 1807), Gazan's troops took three guns and two Russian colors. Otherwise, his troops stayed in their winter quarters. After the new peace treaty, Gazan's troops were sent to Silesia to restore order. In 1808, he was named Comte de la Peyri√©re. =Early Peninsular War= In October 1808, now attached to the VI. Corps, Gazan went to Spain with Jean Lannes and arrived at Zaragoza in December. The city was under siege and defended by Spanish under Jos√© de Palafox. Lannes ordered an attack on 22 January 1809 to capture the city in street by street fighting; when the French took a block, sappers tunneled under the houses and blew them up, which prevented Spanish street fighters from slipping into houses behind them. The method was effective but painstaking. Gazan's assignment, to take the well-fortified Jesus Convent. Palafox surrendered on 20 February. The VI. Corps occupied northern Aragon afterward.David Gates. The Spanish Ulcer. Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2001 [1986]. , p. 126. Smith, p. 278-281. In July 1810, Gazan's force guarded the valleys of Extremadura, near Alcantara. In September he fought against Spanish general La Romana. In January 1811 he crossed the Sierra Morena to guard the supply On 15‚Äì21 March, his 2nd Division of the V. Corps besieged and captured the small fortified town of Campo Maior, in eastern Portugal. There they captured 50 guns and the 100-man Portuguese garrison. As General Latour-Maubourg, four squadrons of dragoons and hussars and three battalions of the 100th Light Infantry moved the cannons to Badajoz the following week, a combined force of the 1st and 7th Portuguese Cavalry and the British 13th Light Dragoons, commanded by Brigadier General Robert Ballard Long, charged and scattered the French 26th Dragoons. In the melee, the drivers of the convoy were cut down, but instead of securing the convoy of guns, the British and Portuguese enthusiastically pursued the fleeing infantry for more than ; meanwhile, the French sallied out of Badajoz, carefully avoiding the fleeing infantry and its pursuers, and recovered all but one of the guns.Smith, \\"Campo Mayor (Maior).\\" Databook. p. 356. At the Battle of Albuera (16 May 1811), the \\"bloodiest battle of the Peninsular Campaign,\\"Smith, \\"Albuera.\\" Databook. p. 362 Gazan's division was hammered by the British. The force, composed of two brigades of infantry, one of cavalry and 40 guns, were enveloped by the British on three sides. General of Division Girard's 1st Division was also trapped. The fire-fight wrought massive casualties, and the bodies were reportedly stacked three and four men high; the distinction was in 360 French muskets in deep and narrow columns versus 2000 British flintlocks in a double line of infantry.Gates, pp. 260‚Äì261. Only a costly mistake by the British commander, Major General Colborne, prevented a worse disaster for the French. Colborne had deployed his infantry in the standard line, two men deep, and had prepared to fire close range volleys into the French flank. Recognizing the opportunity, Latour-Marbourg's 2nd Hussars and First Vistula Lancers (a Polish unit) to attack the British line before the infantry could form its defensive squares. The French cavalry wrought massive casualties on Colborne's brigade. The 3rd (East Kent) Regiment of Foot (\\"The Buffs\\") lost 643 of its 754 men at Albuera, most of them in the initial onslaught of French cavalry. The next two regiments in line lost over 500 men combined and Colborne‚Äôs brigade lost 1,413 out of its 2,166 men. Despite the mounted assault, however, the French 2nd Division suffered high casualties and lost five colors, a significant blow to its morale and pride.J. Rickard, Battle of Albuera, 16 May 1811, 10.00am. History of War (30 March 2008). J. Ricard (editor). Accessed 8 April 2010; Smith, \\"Albuera.\\" Databook. p. 362. Gazan was wounded in the battle, and returned to Seville, where he was assigned to a staff position during his recovery.Mulli√©. 'Biographie des c√©l√©brit√©s militaires... =Gazan and the 1813 Peninsular War= In June 1813, Gazan was appointed commander of the Joseph Bonaparte's Army of the South.Herbert Maxwell (Sir). The life of Wellington. London: S. Low, Marston and Co., 1900. vol. 1, p. 308. Joseph had established a long defensive line on the heights of Puebla, with the Army of Portugal at the left flank, the Army of the Center, commanded by Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon and the Army of the South, at the southern flank. On 21 June, Generals Rowland Hill and Pablo Morillo moved toward the south end of the valley; Gazan and d'Erlon asked Jean-Baptiste Jourdan for reinforcements, but the Corps' commander was preoccupied with the possibility of an attack at the opposite flank, and sent none. In their own turn, D'Erlon and Gazan could not agree on how to deal with the approaching threat. In the initial stages of battle, the Army of Portugal started to pull back. Realizing that his southern flank would not hold up in the face of Hill and Morillo, Joseph ordered Gazan to withdraw in ordered masses. Hill and Morillo attacked Gazan's forces with such force that Gazan withdrew.Gates, pp. 388‚Äì389. This was Gazan's last field command. Gazan's pre- emptive withdrawal created a gap in French line, exposing D'Erlon's army in the center. D'Erlon held his position as long as he could, but the line collapsed around him. Joseph's planned orderly withdrawal turned into a rout. Gazan abandoned all his artillery. The Allies captured the entire supply convoy, all the baggage and took many prisoners, including Gazan's wife and children,Maxwell, p. 322. although they later managed to rejoin him. After losing their supply train, the plight of the French army was terrible. Gazan mentioned that general officers and subordinates alike \\"were reduced to the clothes on their backs and most of them were barefoot,\\"Maxwell, p. 324. but the rank and file of the army also suffered enormously from hunger, exposure, and disease. When Soult took command of the new Army of the Pyrenees, Gazan became his chief of staff until Napoleon's abdication. Napoleon's return and later life During the Hundred Days, Gazan hesitated but eventually joined Napoleon, with little enthusiasm and he did not receive a field command.Smith, \\"Waterloo Order of Battle.\\" Databook. pp. 538‚Äì539. After the war, Jean- Baptiste Jourdan persuaded Gazan to be part of the Conseil convened on 9 November 1815 to try Michel Ney for treason. Despite his oath of allegiance to the restored monarchy, the loyal Ney had rallied to Napoleon's banner immediately upon his landing in southern France and had led a corps into battle at Waterloo. The King wished to make a point to Napoleon's former marshals and Ney became the focus of his wrath.Stephen Millar. Pour encourager les autres: The Trial and Execution of Marshal Michel Ney. The Napoleon Series. Robert Burnham, editor in chief. Published February 2006. Accessed 7 February 2010. Gazan's relationship with Ney had begun in the French Revolutionary Wars shortly after Ney's promotion to general of division. At the Battle of Winterthur (1799), he had been one of Ney's first brigade commanders. Although the King's government may have expected the Conseil to find Ney guilty, the members voted 5‚Äì2 to declare themselves incapable of reaching a verdict, and deferred the case to the Chamber of Peers. Some historians maintain that Ney's death penalty resulted from the military court's refusal to act in the case; only the military court could have returned a verdict of \\"guilty under exceptional circumstances.\\" Such a verdict would have meant Ney's lifelong incarceration, but would not have required his execution. When the military court refused to reach a verdict, Ney's case went to the Chamber of Peers, which was populated by a mix of old and new peers. The old peers might not have been receptive to Ney's predicament; he had been, after all, a highly visible party to Napoleon's success throughout Europe. If some of the new peers were sympathetic to Ney's situation, they may also have been anxious to prove their own loyalty to the new regime. Ney's penalty was a foregone conclusion. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Louis XVIII forced Gazan into retirement in Grasse, where the aging general dabbled unsuccessfully in politics. After the 1830 revolution, the new King of the French Louis Philippe made Gazan a peer of France, and he received a command of a military division in Marseille. By this time, he was an old man, and in poor health, and he retired in June 1832. Gazan de la Peyri√©re died in Grasse on 9 April 1845. See also Names inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe, column 16.

His fictional 1995 memoir, published in English as Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood, was debunked by Swiss journalist and writer in August 1998. The subsequent disclosure of Wilkomirski's fabrications sparked heated debate in the German and English- speaking world. Many critics argued that Fragments no longer had any literary value. Swiss historian and anti-Semitism expert Stefan Maechler later wrote, \\"Once the professed interrelationship between the first-person narrator, the death-camp story he narrates, and historical reality are proved palpably false, what was a masterpiece becomes kitsch.\\"Maechler 2000, p. 281. The book In 1995, Wilkomirski, a professional clarinettist and instrument maker living in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, published a memoir entitled Bruchst√ºcke. Aus einer Kindheit 1939‚Äì1948 (later published in English as Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood). In the book, he described what he claimed were his experiences as a child survivor of the Holocaust. The supposed memories of World War II are presented in a fractured manner and using simple language from the point of view of the narrator, an overwhelmed, very young Jewish child. His first memory is of a man being crushed by uniformed men against the wall of a house; the narrator is seemingly too young for a more precise recollection, but the reader is led to infer that this is his father. Later on, the narrator and his brother hide out in a farmhouse in Poland before being arrested and interned in two Nazi concentration camps, where he meets his dying mother for the last time. After his liberation from the death camps, he is brought to an orphanage in Krak√≥w and, finally, to Switzerland where he lives for decades before being able to reconstruct his fragmented past. =First publication= First published in German in 1995 by the J√ºdischer Verlag (part of the highly respected Suhrkamp Verlag publishing house), Bruchst√ºcke was soon translated into nine languages; an English translation by Carol Brown Janeway with the title Fragments appeared in 1996, published by Schocken. The book earned widespread critical admiration, most particularly in Switzerland and in the English-speaking countries, and won several awards, including the National Jewish Book Award in the United States, the Prix Memoire de la Shoah in France, and the Jewish Quarterly literary prize in Britain.Holocaust Denial: A Sequel The book sold well, but in contradiction to common belief it was not a bestseller. (Maechler, 2001a, pp. 111‚Äì28; Oels, 2004, pp. 376‚Äì79) Wilkomirski was invited to participate in radio and television programs as a witness and expert, and was interviewed and videotaped by reputable archives. In his oral statements Wilkomirski elaborated on many aspects which remained unclear or unexplained. For example, he provided the names of the concentration camps in which he claimed to have been interned (Majdanek and Auschwitz), and added that he had been the victim of unbearable medical experiments. (Maechler, 2001a, pp. 22‚Äì83) Ganzfried's article In August 1998, a Swiss journalist and writer named questioned the veracity of Fragments in an article published in the Swiss newsweekly Weltwoche. Ganzfried argued that Wilkomirski knew the concentration camps \\"only as a tourist\\", and that, far from being born in Latvia, he was actually born Bruno Grosjean, an illegitimate child of an unmarried mother named Yvonne Grosjean from Biel in Switzerland. The boy had been sent to an orphanage in Adelboden, Switzerland, from which he was taken in by the D√∂ssekkers, a wealthy and childless couple in Zurich who finally adopted him. Wilkomirski became a cause c√©l√®bre in the English-speaking world, appearing on 60 Minutes and the BBC and in Granta and The New Yorker. He insisted that he was an authentic Holocaust survivor who had been secretly switched as a young boy with Bruno Grosjean upon his arrival in Switzerland. His supporters condemned Ganzfried, who, however, presented further evidence to support his theory. Wilkomirski could not verify his claims, but Ganzfried was also unable to prove his arguments conclusively. (Maechler, 2001a, pp. 129‚Äì64; Eskin, 2002, pp. 104‚Äì53) =Exposure= In April 1999, Wilkomirski's literary agency commissioned the Zurich historian Stefan Maechler to investigate the accusations. The historian presented his findings to his client and to the nine publishers of Fragments in the autumn of that year. Maechler concluded that Ganzfried's allegations were correct, and that Wilkomirski's alleged autobiography was a fraud. Maechler described in detail in his report how Grosjean-Wilkomirski had developed his fictional life story step by step and over decades. Most fascinating was his discovery that Wilkomirski's alleged experiences in German-occupied Poland closely corresponded with real events of his factual childhood in Switzerland, to the point that he suggested the author rewrote and reframed his own experience in a complex manner, turning the occurrences of his real life into that of a child surviving the Holocaust. It remained unclear to Maechler whether Grosjean-Wilkomirski had done this deliberately or if the writer actually believed what he had written, but he was skeptical that the writer was a \\"cold, calculating crook\\", as Ganzfried assumed. (Maechler, 2001b, pp. 67‚Äì69) Amongst other things, Maechler revealed that a Holocaust survivor Wilkomirski claimed to have known in the camps, a woman named Laura Grabowski, had been earlier unearthed as a fraud, and had previously used the name Lauren Stratford to write about alleged satanic ritual abuse ‚Äî a story which itself had been debunked nearly a decade earlier. Maechler's first report was published in German in March 2000; the English edition appeared one year later (Maechler, 2001a) and included the original English translation of Fragments which had been withdrawn by the publisher after Maechler's report. Subsequently, the historian published two essays with additional findings and analysis (Maechler, 2001b, 2002), while Ganzfried (2002) published his own controversial version of the case (s. Oels, 2004; Maechler, 2002). Journalist Blake Eskin (2002) covered the affair. Prior to the exposure, Eskin wrote and told the story of Wilkomirski's trip to the US to become reunited with people he claimed to be distant family, of which Eskin was a part. This story was aired in act two of This American Life episode 82, \\"Haunted\\".This American Life, Haunted 1997, Radio archives: episode 82. The writer Elena Lappin published an extensive report in May 1999. She had become acquainted with Wilkomirski two years before, when the Jewish Quarterly awarded him its prize for nonfiction. At the time, she was editor of that English magazine. In the course of her research, she identified a number of contradictions in Wilkomirski's story and came to believe that Fragments was fiction. (Lappin 1999) In addition, she reported that Wilkomirski's uncle, Max Grosjean, said that as children he and his sister Yvonne (Wilkomirski's biological mother) had been Verdingkinder (or \\"earning children\\")‚Äîin other words, that they had been part of the old Swiss institution of orphaned children working for families, with overtones of child slavery. Eskin's interest in Wilkomirski had its origins in genealogy: his family had ancestors in Riga and, initially, they believed that the author of Fragments could perhaps be a long-lost relative. In the same year (2002) the public prosecutor of the canton of Zurich announced that she found no evidence of criminal fraud. She added that a DNA test she had ordered had confirmed that Wilkomirski and Grosjean were the same person.Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, 13 December 2002.  Aftermath  The disclosure of Wilkomirski's fabrications altered the status of his book. Many critics argued that Fragments no longer had any literary value. ‚ÄúOnce the professed interrelationship between the first-person narrator, the death-camp story he narrates, and historical reality are proved palpably false, what was a masterpiece becomes kitsch‚Äù (Maechler, 2000, p. 281). But for a few scholars, even as a pseudomemoir, the merits of the work still remain. ‚ÄúThose merits reside in a ferocious vision, a powerful narrative, an accumulation of indelible images, and the unforgettable way in which a small child's voice is deployed in an unfeeling adult world, during the war and thereafter‚Äù (Zeitlin, 2003, p. 177, see also Suleiman, 2006, p. 170). The Wilkomirski case was heatedly debated in Germany and in Switzerland as a textbook example of the contemporary treatment of the Holocaust and of the perils of using it for one's own causes. However, the affair transcends the specific context of the Holocaust (see e.g. Chambers, 2002; Gabriel, 2004; Langer, 2006; Maechler, 2001b; Oels, 2004; Suleiman, 2006; Wickman, 2007). Wilkomirski's case raises questions about the literary genre of autobiography, the aesthetics of a literary work's reception, oral history, witness testimony, memory research,Daniel L. Schacter, How the Mind Forgets and Remembers: The Seven Sins of Memory, Houghton Mifflin 2001, . In considering the question \\"Is Wilkomirski simply a liar?\\" Schachter feels there is a possibility that some of his Wilkomirski's detailed recollections may have been a case of suggestion. trauma therapies, and the like. The case is discussed in great detail by psychologists Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson as an interesting case of self-inflicted false memories (Tavris and Aronson, 2007, pp. 82ff.)

Payne Best, The Venlo Incident, first published by Hutchinson & Co, 1950. pp. 14‚Äì17. The incident was later used by the German Nazi government to link Britain to Georg Elser's failed assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler at the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller in Munich, on 8 November 1939, and to help justify Germany's invasion of the Netherlands, a neutral country, on 10 May 1940.Hitler first mentioned the possibility of using the Venlo incident as an excuse for invading the Netherlands at a military conference on 23 November 1939. See Documents on German Foreign Policy, Series D, Vol. VIII, 445. Background  Historic Venlo on the river Meuse After the British declaration of war on Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was still interested in seeking a compromise peace with Germany before too much blood had been spilt.Martin A. Allen, Himmler's Secret War: The Covert Peace Negotiations of Heinrich Himmler, Robson Books, London, 2005, p. 54. The British Government was well aware of the existence of widespread opposition among the leaders of the German Army.see also Blomberg‚ÄìFritsch affair. During the autumn of 1939, the German opposition was throwing out feelers to the British government. In October, Munich lawyer Josef M√ºller got in touch with the British through the Vatican with the connivance of Colonel Hans Oster. Theodor Kordt, the younger brother of Erich, pursued similar objectives in Bern. The Swedish industrialist Birger Dahlerus tried to establish peace through an early form of shuttle diplomacy, partly performed on Dutch soil. And in early October the Dutch ambassador in Ankara, Philips Christiaan Visser, was communicating peace proposals on the line of the Dahlerus proposals, made by Hitler's former deputy chancellor and then ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, to the British ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull- Hugessen.Bob de Graaff, The Venlo Incident, London, 1990, S. 2‚Äì13 All diplomatic efforts to avoid a Second World War in Europe during the days preceding the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 had come to nothing. So when a German refugee named Fischer succeeded in winning the confidence of the exiled Catholic leader, Karl Spiecker, a British intelligence informant in the Netherlands, the British SIS became interested in the information Fischer was offering.Nigel Jones, Introduction to The Venlo Incident, Frontline Books, 2009, p. xii.  Covert meetings  Walter Schellenberg In early September 1939, a meeting was arranged between Fischer and the British SIS agent Captain Sigismund Payne Best. Best was an experienced British Army intelligence officer who worked under the cover of a businessman residing in The Hague with his Dutch wife.Nigel Jones, Introduction to The Venlo Incident, 2009, p. xi. Subsequent meetings included Major Richard Henry Stevens, a less-experienced intelligence operative who was working covertly for the British SIS as the passport control officer in The Hague. To assist Best and Stevens in passing through the Dutch mobilised zones near the border with Germany, a young Dutch officer, Lieutenant Dirk Klop, was recruited by Chief of the Dutch Military Intelligence, Major General Johan van Oorschot. Klop was permitted by Van Oorschot to sit in on covert meetings but could not take part because of his country's neutrality.Captain Sigismund Payne Best, The Venlo Incident, Hutchinson & Co, 1950. p. 9. Fischer brought to the early meetings, participants who were posing as German officers who supported a plot against Hitler and were interested in establishing Allied peace terms if Hitler was deposed.Captain S. Payne Best, The Venlo Incident, Hutchinson & Co, 1950, p. 11. When Fischer's success in setting up the meetings with the British agents became known, Sturmbannf√ºhrer Walter Schellenberg of the Foreign Intelligence section of the Sicherheitsdienst began to attend these meetings. Masquerading as a \\"Hauptmann Sch√§mmel\\", Schellenberg was at the time a trusted operative of Heinrich Himmler and was in close contact with Reinhard Heydrich during the Venlo operation.Martin A. Allen, Himmler's Secret War: The Covert Peace Negotiations of Heinrich Himmler, Robson Books, London, 2005 At the last meeting between the British SIS agents and the German SD officers on 8 November, Schellenberg promised to bring a general to the meeting on the following day. Instead, the Germans brought the talks to an abrupt end with the kidnapping of Best and Stevens.Captain S. Payne Best, The Venlo Incident, Hutchinson & Co, 1950, p. 14. = Sequence = Reconstruction of the incident in 1948 Cafe Backus with the German border in the background The covert meetings leading up to the kidnapping, as remembered by Captain S. Payne Best in his book The Venlo Incident, are summarised below.Captain S. Payne Best, The Venlo Incident, Hutchinson & Co,1950. pp 7‚Äì14. # Best met with Fischer at an unspecified location in the Netherlands at the beginning of September 1939. # At the second meeting, Fischer brought a Major Solms to meet Best. Best believed that Solm was a major in the Luftwaffe. They met at a small hotel in the town of Venlo. (Date unspecified) # Best met with Fischer and Major Solms a week later. (Location and date unspecified) Solm told Best there was a conspiracy to remove Hitler from power in which some of the highest-ranking officers of the Wehrmacht were involved. Solms could give no further details as the 'ringleaders' would deal directly only with Best. However, before they would meet, they required certainty that Best was a bona fide British agent and requested that he arrange for a certain paragraph to be broadcast in the German News Bulletin of the BBC. That was done twice on 11 October, about the same day that Best was informed by Major Solms he feared he was being watched by the Gestapo and needed to 'lie low'. # On 20 October, together with Fischer, Major Stevens and Lieutenant Klop, Best met with two German officers, Captain von Seidlitz and Lieutenant Grosh, in a private house that was owned by a friend of Best in Arnhem. The meeting was interrupted by Dutch police and little progress was made. 'The two Huns seemed scared out of their wits and it was very difficult to get anything out of them except that they wanted to go home', Best recalled. # On 30 October, Best, Major Stevens and Lieutenant Klop met with three German officers: Lieutenant Grosh, Colonel Martini and Major Schaemmel at The Hague. (Klop had collected the three Germans near Dinxperlo after they were arrested by Dutch police near the frontier.) Schaemmel, speaking for the Germans, outlined current conditions in Germany and the losses of men and material in the Polish campaign and how it was imperative the war be ended quickly. Schaemmel went on to say Hitler would not take advice from his General Staff and needed to be got rid of, but his assassination would lead to chaos. The intention was to take him prisoner and force him to give orders authorising a junta of officers to start negotiations for peace. 'We are Germans and have to think of the interests of our own country first. Before we take any steps against Hitler we want to know whether England and France are ready to grant us a peace which is both just and honourable', Best recollects Schaemmel saying at the meeting. To facilitate further dialogue, a wireless transmitting and receiving set was given to the Germans. Stevens referred Schaemmel's question to London, and a day or two later, a noncommittal reply came back. More messages were exchanged on a daily basis by wireless before another meeting was arranged. # On 7 November, Best, Major Stevens, Lieutenant Klop met with two German officers: Lieutenant Grosh and Major Schaemmel. Klop was instrumental in holding the meeting in the Cafe Backus, on the outskirts of Venlo, as the venue better suited the Germans, as it was close to the border crossing. Best and Stevens gave the Germans a verbal r√©sum√© of London's answers to their questions. Though the answers appeared not to come up to their expectations, the Germans said they would pass them on to their 'chief' and proposed a meeting with him the next day, as he was anxious to entrust 'secret papers' to Best and Stevens for safekeeping if the plot against Hitler failed. # On 8 November, Best, Major Stevens and Lieutenant Klop met only with Schaemmel at the Cafe Backus. Schaemmel said the general, who was to have come, had been called by Hitler to urgent meeting in Munich to consider an appeal for peace made by the Queen of the Netherlands and the King of Belgium. Schaemmel asked Best and Stevens to meet again on the following day at the same venue to enable the general to be present, adding that as an 'attempt' against Hitler was to be made on Saturday, the next day would be the last chance for a meeting. # On 9 November, the meeting was planned for 4 pm. As for the last meeting, Klop arranged for a Dutch police guard to be present at the border. Unlike previous meetings, Best and Stevens armed themselves with Browning automatics in case something went wrong. =Notes= * Fischer was known to Best as Dr Franz, a German refugee.Captain S. Payne Best, The Venlo Incident, Hutchinson & Co, 1950. p 7. According to Martin A.

Capture of British agents  Richard H. Stevens, 1939 Early on 9 November 1939, Schellenberg received orders from Himmler to abduct the British SIS agents, Best and Stevens. SS- Sonderkommandos under the operations command of SD man Alfred Naujocks, carried out the orders.Bob de Graaff, \\"The Venlo Incident\\", World War Investigator 13/1990, London 1990, S. 2‚Äì13 Best drove his car into the car park at the Cafe Backus for the meeting planned for 16:00 with Schellenberg. Stevens was sitting beside him while Dirk Klop and his driver, Jan Lemmens, sat in the back seat. Before Best had time to get out of the car, Naujock's SD men arrived. In a brief shootout, Klop was mortally wounded. After being handcuffed and stood against a wall, Best and Stevens, together with Jan Lemmens, were bundled into the SD car. Klop was put into Best's car and both cars were driven off over the border into Germany.Captain S. Payne Best, The Venlo Incident, Hutchinson & Co., 1950, pp. 16‚Äì19. Best recalls a full body search was performed on him when they reached D√ºsseldorf en route to Berlin. At D√ºsseldorf, one of the men who had taken part in the kidnapping told Best the reason for the action was to catch some Germans plotting against the F√ºhrer, who were responsible for the attempt on his life the night earlier.Captain S. Payne Best, The Venlo Incident, Hutchinson & Co., 1950, pp. 20‚Äì22. Klop was admitted to the Protestant Hospital in D√ºsseldorf. A doctor on duty recalled years later Klop was unconscious when he was admitted and died the same day from a gun wound to the head.Walther Behrens, \\"Dirk Klop\\"  Georg Elser connection  Prior to the assassination attempt at the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller in Munich on 8 November, Naujocks and his squad had been sent to D√ºsseldorf to support Schellenberg. Even before his private train had returned from Munich to Berlin, Hitler ordered the British SIS officers in the Netherlands be brought to Berlin for questioning. Himmler issued the order to Schellenberg early in the morning on 9 November.G√ºnter Peis, The Man Who Started The War, London, 1960 Though Georg Elser, a suspect being interrogated in Munich by the Gestapo, insisted he had acted alone, Hitler recognized the propaganda value of the assassination attempt as a means to incite German public resentment against Britain. On 21 November, Hitler declared he had incontrovertible proof that the British Secret Service was behind the Munich bombing and that two British agents had been arrested near the Dutch border. The next day, German newspapers carried the story. The front page of the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung had pictures of the conspirators named as Georg Elser, 'Kaptain Stevens' and 'Mr Best'.Deutsche-Allgemeine-Zeitung, 22 November 1939.  Aftermath  Sigismund P. Best, 1939 The Nazi press reported that the Gestapo had tricked the British Secret Service into carrying on radio contact for 21 days after Best and Stevens were abducted using the radio transmitter given to them. Himmler is accredited to quipping, 'After a while it became boring to converse with such arrogant and foolish people'. The British Foreign Office believed that Himmler was involved in the secret Anglo- German contact of autumn 1939, and that the discussions, involving prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, and the foreign secretary, Lord Halifax, were bona fide peace negotiations. Historian Callum MacDonald shared this view.Callum MacDonald, \\"The Venlo Affair\\", European Studies Review Vol. 8 (1978) No. 4, London 1978. The damage inflicted on Britain's espionage network in Europe caused the new prime minister, Winston Churchill, to start his own spy and sabotage agency, the Special Operations Executive in 1940. The incident exposed the fact that the Chamberlain government was still seeking a deal with Germany while it was exhorting the nation to a supreme war effort. That outraged Churchill to the extent that he was against providing support to German opposition to Hitler for the rest of the war.Nigel Jones, Introduction to The Venlo Incident by S. Payne Best, published by Pen & Sword Books, 2009. Hitler used the incident to claim that the Netherlands had violated its own neutrality. The presence of Klop, a Dutch agent, whose signature on his personal papers was gratefully misused by the Germans, provided sufficient \\"proof of cooperation between British and Dutch secret services, and justify an invasion of The Netherlands by Germany in May, 1940\\". Naujocks was awarded the Iron Cross by Hitler the day after the kidnapping. Schellenberg gave evidence against other Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials. He died in 1952, at age 42.  Fate of British agents  After interrogation at the Gestapo Prinz- Albrecht-Strasse headquarters in Berlin, Best and Stevens were sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Both were held in isolation in the T-shaped building reserved for protected prisoners of the Gestapo.Captain S. Payne Best, The Venlo Incident, Hutchinson & Co, 1950. While at Sachsenhausen, Best claimed he corresponded by secret letters with another protected prisoner, Georg Elser.Captain S. Payne Best, The Venlo Incident, Hutchinson & Co, 1950, p. 94. In January 1941, Stevens was moved from Sachsenhausen to the bunker at Dachau concentration camp, where he remained until evacuated with Best and other protected prisoners in April 1945. In February 1945, Best was transferred briefly to Buchenwald concentration camp and then to the 'bunker' at Dachau concentration camp on 9 April 1945. Coincidentally, that was the same day that Elser was executed at Dachau.

She is one of a small number of women with a documented record of military combat experience in that war. She served 17 months in the army under the name \\"Robert Shirtliff\\" (also spelled in various sources as Shirtliffe and Shurtleff) of Uxbridge, Massachusetts, was wounded in 1782, and was honorably discharged at West Point, New York, in 1783. Early life Deborah Sampson was born on December 17, 1760, in Plympton, Massachusetts, into a family of modest means. Her father's name was Jonathan Sampson (or Samson) and her mother's name was Deborah Bradford. Her siblings were Jonathan (b. 1753), Elisha (b. 1755), Hannah (b. 1756), Ephraim (b. 1759), Nehemiah (b. 1764), and Sylvia (b. 1766). Sampson's mother was the great-granddaughter of William Bradford, Governor of Plymouth Colony. Sampson's ancestry also included additional Mayflower passengers. Sampson was told that her father had most likely disappeared at sea, but evidence suggests that he actually abandoned the family and migrated to Lincoln County, Maine. He took a common-law wife named Martha, had two or more children with her, and returned to Plympton in 1794 to attend to a property transaction. In 1770, someone in Maine named Jonathan Sampson was indicted for murder, but it is uncertain whether this individual was Sampson's father because there are no existing records containing biographical details about the defendant in the case. When Sampson's father abandoned the family, her mother was unable to provide for her children, so she placed them in the households of friends and relatives, a common practice in 18th-century New England. Sampson was placed in the home of a maternal relative. When her mother died shortly afterwards, she was sent to live with Reverend Peter Thatcher's widow Mary Prince Thatcher (1688‚Äì1771), who was then in her eighties. Historians believe she learned to read while living with the widow Thatcher, who might have wanted Sampson to read Bible verses to her. Upon the widow's death, Sampson was sent to live with the Jeremiah Thomas family in Middleborough, where she worked as an indentured servant from 1770 to 1778. Although treated well, she was not sent to school like the Thomas children because Thomas was not a believer in the education of women. Sampson was able to overcome Thomas's opposition by learning from Thomas's sons, who shared their school work with her. This method was apparently successful; when her time as an indentured servant was over at age 18, Sampson made a living by teaching school during the summer sessions in 1779 and 1780. She worked as a weaver in the winter; Sampson was highly skilled and worked for the Sproat Tavern as well as the Bourne, Morton, and Leonard families. During her time teaching and weaving, she boarded with the families that employed her. Sampson was also reported to have woodworking and mechanical aptitude. Her skills included basket weaving, and light carpentry such as producing milking stools and winter sleds. She was also experienced with fashioning wooden tools and implements including weather vanes, spools for thread, and quills for weaving. She also produced pie crimpers, which she sold door to door. Physical description Sampson was approximately 5 feet 9 inches tall, compared to the average woman of her day, who was around 5 feet, and the average man, who was 5 feet 6 inches to 5 feet 8 inches tall. Her biographer, Hermann Mann, who knew her personally for many years, implied that she was not thin, writing in 1797 that \\"her waist might displease a coquette.\\" He also reported that her breasts were very small, and that she bound them with a linen cloth to hide them during her years in uniform. Mann wrote that \\"the features of her face are regular; but not what a physiognomist would term the most beautiful.\\" A neighbor who, as a boy, knew Sampson in her later years, remarked that she was \\"a person of plain features.\\" A descendant named Pauline Hildreth Monk Wise (1914‚Äì1994) was believed by relatives to have strongly resembled Sampson, based on comparison of Pauline's physical appearance to a 1797 portrait of Sampson, contemporary descriptions of Sampson's features and height, and Pauline's height, which at 6 feet was taller than most men. Sampson's appearance ‚Äî tall, broad, strong, and not delicately feminine ‚Äî contributed to her success at pretending to be a man. Army service In early 1782, Sampson wore men's clothes and joined an Army unit in Middleborough, Massachusetts under the name Timothy Thayer. She collected a bonus and then failed to meet up with her company as scheduled. Inquiries by the company commander revealed that Sampson had been recognized by a local resident at the time she signed her enlistment papers. Her deception uncovered, she repaid the portion of the bonus that she had not spent, but she was not subjected to further punishment by the Army. The Baptist church to which she belonged learned of her actions and withdrew its fellowship, meaning that its members refused to associate with her unless she apologized and asked forgiveness. In May 1782, Sampson enlisted again, this time in Uxbridge, Massachusetts under the name \\"Robert Shirtliff\\" (also spelled in some sources as \\"Shirtliffe\\" or \\"Shurtleff\\"). She joined the Light Infantry Company of the 4th Massachusetts Regiment, under the command of Captain George Webb (1740‚Äì1825). This unit, consisting of 50 to 60 men, was first quartered in Bellingham, Massachusetts, and later mustered at Worcester with the rest of the regiment commanded by Colonel William Shepard. Light Infantry Companies were elite troops, specially picked because they were taller and stronger than average. Their job was to provide rapid flank coverage for advancing regiments, as well as rearguard and forward reconnaissance duties for units on the move. Because she joined an elite unit, Sampson's disguise was more likely to succeed, since no one was likely to look for a woman among soldiers who were specially chosen for their above average size and superior physical ability. Sampson fought in several skirmishes. During her first battle, on July 3, 1782 outside Tarrytown, New York, she took two musket balls in her thigh and sustained a cut on her forehead. She begged her fellow soldiers not take her to a doctor out of fear her sex would be discovered, but a soldier put her on his horse and took her to a hospital. A doctor treated her head wound, but she left the hospital before he could attend to her leg. She removed one of the balls herself with a penknife and sewing needle, but the other was too deep for her to reach. She carried it in her leg for the rest of her life and her leg never fully healed. On April 1, 1783, she was reassigned to new duties, and spent seven months serving as a waiter to General John Paterson. The war was thought to be over following the Battle of Yorktown, but since there was no official peace treaty, the Continental Army remained in uniform. On June 24, the President of Congress ordered George Washington to send a contingent of soldiers under Paterson to Philadelphia to help quell a rebellion of American soldiers who were protesting delays in receiving their pay and discharges. During the summer of 1783, Sampson became ill in Philadelphia and was cared for by Doctor Barnabas Binney (1751‚Äì1787). He removed her clothes to treat her and discovered the cloth she used to bind her breasts. Without revealing his discovery to army authorities, he took her to his house, where his wife, daughters, and a nurse took care of her. In September 1783, following the signing of the Treaty of Paris, November 3 was set as the date for soldiers to muster out. When Dr. Binney asked Sampson to deliver a note to General Paterson, she correctly assumed that it would reveal her sex. In other cases, women who pretended to be men to serve in the army were reprimanded, but Paterson gave her a discharge, a note with some words of advice, and enough money to travel home. She was honorably discharged at West Point, New York, on October 25, 1783, after a year and a half of service. An official record of Deborah Sampson Gannett's service as \\"Robert Shirtliff\\" from May 20, 1782 to Oct 25, 1783 appears in the \\"Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors of the Revolutionary War\\" series. Marriage Statue of Sampson at Sharon, Massachusetts, public library Deborah Sampson was married in Stoughton, Massachusetts, to Benjamin Gannett (1757‚Äì1827), a farmer from Sharon, Massachusetts, on April 7, 1785. They had three children: Earl (b. 1786), Mary (b. 1788), and Patience (b. 1790). They also adopted Susanna Baker Shepard, an orphan. They farmed on land that had been in Gannett's family for generations; their farm was smaller than average, and the land was not productive because it had been worked extensively. Final years and death In January 1792, Sampson petitioned the Massachusetts State Legislature for pay which the army had withheld from her because she was a woman. The legislature granted her petition and Governor John Hancock signed it. The legislature awarded her 34 pounds plus interest back to her discharge in 1783. In 1802, Sampson began giving lectures about her wartime service. She began by extolling the virtues of traditional gender roles for women, but toward the end of her presentation she left the stage, returned dressed in her army uniform, and then performed a complicated and physically taxing military drill and ceremony routine. She performed both to earn money and to justify her enlistment, but even with these speaking engagements, she was not making enough money to pay her expenses. She frequently had to borrow money from her family and from her friend Paul Revere. Revere also wrote letters to government officials on her behalf, requesting that she be awarded a pension for her military service and her wounds. In 1804, Revere wrote to U.S. Representative William Eustis of Massachusetts on Sampson's behalf. A military pension had never been requested for a woman. Revere wrote: \\"I have been induced to enquire her situation, and character, since she quit the male habit, and soldiers uniform; for the more decent apparel of her own gender...humanity and justice obliges me to say, that every person with whom I have conversed about her, and it is not a few, speak of her as a woman with handsome talents, good morals, a dutiful wife, and an affectionate parent.\\" On March 11, 1805, Congress approved the request and placed Sampson on the Massachusetts Invalid Pension Roll at the rate of four dollars a month. On February 22, 1806, Sampson wrote once more to Revere requesting a loan of ten dollars: \\"My own indisposition and that of my sons causes me again to solicit your goodness in our favor though I, with Gratitude, confess it rouses every tender feeling and I blush at the thought of receiving ninety and nine good turns as it were‚Äîmy circumstances require that I should ask the hundredth.\\" He sent the ten dollars. In 1809, she sent another petition to Congress, asking that her pension as an invalid soldier be modified to start from her discharge in 1783. Had her petition been approved, she would have been awarded back pay of $960 ‚Äî approximately $13,800 in 2016 ($48 a year for 20 years). Her petition was denied, but when it came before Congress again in 1816 an award of $76.80 a year (about $1,100 in 2016 dollars) was approved. With this amount, she was able to repay all her loans and make improvements to the family farm. Sampson died of yellow fever at the age of 66 on April 29, 1827, and was buried at Rock Ridge Cemetery in Sharon, Massachusetts. Legacy =Memorials= The town of Sharon now memorializes Sampson with a statue in front of the public library, the Deborah Sampson Park, and the \\"Deborah Sampson Gannett House,\\" which is privately owned and not open to the public. The farmland around the home is protected to ensure no development occurs on the historic homestead. In 1906, the town of Plympton, Massachusetts, with the Deborah Sampson Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, placed a boulder on the town green, with a bronze plaque inscribed to Sampson's memory. During World War II, the Liberty Ship S.S. Deborah Gannett (2620) was named in her honor. It was laid down March 10, 1944, launched April 10, 1944 and scrapped in 1962. As of 2000, the town flag of Plympton incorporates Sampson as the Official Heroine of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. =Portrayals in art and media= * Portrait of Deborah: A Drama in Three Acts (1959) is a play by Charles Emery that made its debut at the Camden Hills Theatre, Camden, Maine, on February 19, 1959. * I'm Deborah Sampson: A Soldier of the Revolution (1977) by Patricia Clapp is a fictional account of Sampson's early life and experience in the Revolutionary War. * Sampson is depicted as Robert Shurtless, one of the comedic soldiers in The Rebel Mess in The American Revolution (1999) by Kirk Wood Bromley. * Whoopi Goldberg portrayed Sampson in \\"Deborah Sampson: Soldier of the Revolution\\" (2003), episode 34 of Liberty's Kids. * Alex Myers, a descendant of Sampson's, published Revolutionary (2014), a fictionalized account of her life. * Historian and journalist Alison Leigh Cowan presented \\"Deborah Sampson: Continental Army soldier,\\" a biographical talk at Saint Paul's Church National Historic Site on July 7, 2016. * Meryl Streep included Sampson in her speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, along with other women who had made history. * Sampson's story, as narrated by Paget Brewster, was re-enacted in the fifth season premiere of Drunk History, where Evan Rachel Wood portrayed Sampson.

The Villa Borghese gardens still cover of green on the site, now in the heart of Rome, above the Spanish Steps. History =Lucullus= The fabled gardens of Lucullus were among the most influential in the history of gardening. For introducing the Persian garden, Pompey mockingly nicknamed Lucullus \\"the Roman Xerxes\\", and Tubero called him \\"Xerxes in a toga\\".Plutarch, Lucullus .39; Velleius Paterculus, II.33 - Cassius Dio LX.27 referred to the gardens as the horti Asiatici (probably referring to their being owned by Valerius Asiaticus rather than their being 'Asiatic'). These comments demonstrate that it was well understood in Rome that this new luxury of gardening originated in Persia. Lucullus had firsthand experience of the Persian gardening style, in the satraps' gardens of Anatolia (\\"Asia\\" to the Romans) and in Mesopotamia and Persia itself. As Plutarch pointed out, \\"Lucullus [was] the first Roman who carried an army over Taurus, passed the Tigris, took and burnt the royal palaces of Asia in the sight of the kings, Tigranocerta, Cabira, Sinope, and Nisibis, seizing and overwhelming the northern parts as far as the Phasis, the east as far as Media, and making the South and Red Sea his own through the kings of the Arabians.\\" Lucullus' rural villas in the hills at Tusculum, near modern Frascati, and at Naples were also set in lavish garden settings. Plutarch, 'Lucullus' ch. 37 mentions \\"the chambers and galleries, with their sea-views, built at Naples by Lucullus, out of the spoils of the barbarians.\\", and Pliny writes of Lucullus cutting a channel through a mountain on his Naples estate to allow seawater to circulate in his fishpond, which recalled the channel that had been cut through the isthmus at Mount Athos by the Persian king.Pliny, IX.171 - also in this book are references to scientific observations carried out on Lucullus's fish. Plutarch, like most of Lucullus' Roman contemporaries, thought these occupations of Lucullus' retirement unbecoming to a Roman, and mere play: Though a Lucullan feast has passed into proverb, Lucullus was not a mere conspicuous consumer. He formed a fine library and kept it open to scholars, wrote himself and supported writers. His garden was filled with works of art, particularly Greek sculpture, both originals and copies of ‚Äúold masters‚Äù, and has thus been a rich archaeological source of ancient sculpture - the statue of the 'Scythian knife sharpener' (now thought to depict the executioner getting ready to flay Marsyas) which the Medici removed to Florence, for example, was found in this garden. Lucullus is memorialized with a strain of Swiss chard. =Later history= These gardens became the favorite playground of Claudius' Empress Messalina (after she forced the current owner, Valerius Asiaticus, to commit suicide - Tac. Annals XI.1), and was the site of her murder in 48 AD on the orders of the Emperor Claudius, her husband. From shortly afterwards, in around 55 AD, mosaics excavated in the gardens have provided the earliest known use of tesserae made with the technique of gold sandwich glass, which was to remain an essential component of Byzantine and Western mosaics.Conventi, 1-3; specifically, \\"the earliest known use of gold tesserae was in 55 AD, in the Gardens of Lucullus by the Spanish Steps in Rome In the 16th century they were owned by Felice della Rovere, daughter of Pope Julius II.

Biography Childhood home of Elis Regina, in Porto Alegre National Archives of Brazil Elis Regina was born in Porto Alegre, where she began her career as a singer at an early age on the children's radio show Clube de Guri. In her early teens she signed a record contract and a couple years later traveled to Rio de Janeiro, where she recorded her first album. She won her first festival song contest in 1965 singing \\"Arrast√£o\\" (\\"Pull the Trawling Net\\") by Edu Lobo and Vin√≠cius de Moraes, which made her the biggest selling Brazilian recording artist since Carmen Miranda. Her second album, Dois na Bossa with Jair Rodrigues, set a national sales record and became the first Brazilian album to sell over one million copies. \\"Arrast√£o\\" increased her popularity because the festival was broadcast via TV and radio. The record represented the beginning of m√∫sica popular brasileira (Brazilian popular music) and contrasted with bossa nova. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she helped popularize tropicalismo with Gal Costa, Gilberto Gil, and Caetano Veloso. Regina was nicknamed \\"hurricane\\" and \\"little pepper\\". She moved to Rio around the time Brazil was ruled by a military group. Although her popularity protected her from reprisal when she criticized the regime while on tour in Europe, she was threatened with imprisonment unless she sang the Brazilian national anthem at an event honoring the anniversary of the coup. In the 1970s she recorded the album Elis and Tom in Los Angeles with Antonio Carlos Jobim. In 1982 she was starting her third marriage when she died from a combination of alcohol and cocaine at the age of thirty-six. Death On January 19, 1982, Regina died at the age of 36 from an accidental cocaine overdose. More than 15,000 people including friends and relatives attended and sang her songs at a wake held in the Teatro Bandeirantes in S√£o Paulo. More than 100,000 people and fans then followed her funeral procession throughout S√£o Paulo. She was buried in Cemit√©rio do Morumbi. In 2016, her life was portrayed in a movie, where her role was interpreted by Andr√©ia Horta. The film was directed by Hugo Prata.

The successful operation's aim was to take control of the western Negev Desert. It was a small operation, executed between two larger operations in that theatre, Operation Yoav and Operation Horev. Sheikh Nuran following its occupation by the Israeli Army during Operation Assaf, December 1948  Background  Sheikh Nuran, 1945 Following Operation Yoav, the Egyptian Army tried to stabilize a defensive line between its two arms of controlled territory in the Negev, along the Beer Sheva-Gaza road. With international peace-efforts intensifying, both sides felt that the war was drawing to a close, and such a strong defensive line would help Egypt claim the majority of western and southern Negev, which included some Israeli settlements. Israel wished to disconnect the two Egyptian arms before it could construct and man strong fortifications along the new defense line. So, Operation Assaf was planned and carried out starting December 5, just two weeks after Operation Yoav ended. In order to surprise the defenders, IDF units were transported via the newly captured Beer Sheva to the Egyptian Army's southern (rear) flank, and attacked northwards (the Egyptians expected attacks from the north and east).  Participating forces  The operation was carried out mainly with the Golani Brigade's Gideon Battalion infantry forces, for whom this was the first operation in southern Israel or in flat desert terrain (Golani was normally stationed in the lush and hilly Upper Galilee region, near the Golan Heights for which it is named). In addition, the assault battalion and several armoured personnel carriers from the armored battalion, both of the 8th Armored Brigade, participated in combat. A few artillery and mortar batteries assisted them. The main assaults were carried out by the mechanized forces, while Golani's infantry came in the second wave to cleanse and defend newly captured positions.  Operational phases  Phase 1, went according to plan, with IDF forces capturing three important Egyptian positions without major combat or casualties, on the operation's first day (December 5, 1948). Phase 2, carried out on the following day (December 6, 1948) captured another important position, thus completing all the operation's objectives. However, the Israelis met stronger resistance at another position (which was not captured) and were forced to stop their advance when they hit a minefield in another location. On the same day, the Egyptians counter-attacked the captured positions from their main positions in the west, with an infantry battalion, a tank company and some accurate artillery. The attack came very close to breaking the Israeli defenders, but broke off at dusk. Later data indicated that this was the Egyptian tank battalion's first combat action, after having arrived from Egypt barely two weeks earlier. It had lost 5 of its 12 attacking tanks on that day (number of casualties unknown); Five Israelis were killed in the counter-attack and 28 were wounded. The Egyptians made preparations to continue the counter-attack on the afternoon of the following day (December 7). However, Israeli Air Force reconnaissance revealed the Egyptian preparations in the morning. The Israeli assault battalion was sent to the Egyptian's north (left) flank and stormed their forces southwards, then chased the retreating Egyptians westward, eventually stopping in face of strong anti-tank Egyptian positions. It was reported that a hundred Egyptian soldiers were left dead in the wake of the assault; the Israelis had 2 wounded and none killed. During the next week, the Israeli forces cleared the area's minefields, dug defensive fortifications, and harassed nearby Egyptian forces, before being pulled out of the region in preparations for Operation Horev.

It had a population of 4,460 in 2004 and is the site of Huntly Castle. Its neighbouring settlements include Keith and Rothiemay. Both Huntly and the surrounding district of Gordon are named for a town and family that originated in the Border country.Gazetteer of Scotland (1882-5) Huntly Castle Huntly is the historic home of the Gordon Highlanders regiment which traditionally recruited throughout the North-East of Scotland.Gordon Highlanders Museum website Huntly has a primary school (Gordon Primary) and a secondary school (The Gordon Schools) beside Huntly Castle. It is the home of the Deans bakers, which produce shortbread biscuits. In November 2007, Deans of Huntly opened their new visitor centre. There is also a falconry centre just outside the town which does flying displays in their visitor centre during the season between April and October. Arts Huntly is home to Deveron Projects, an arts organisation that invites artists from all over the world to come and live and work in the town. Since 1995 it has worked with a 'town is the venue' methodology, connecting artists, communities and places. It hosts artists and projects that explore local, regional and global topics, such as forestry, geology, botany, foraging, anthropology, history, politics and art. Over 100 renowned artists have spent time in the town, including Roman Signer, Hamish Fulton, and Christine Borland. Walking is often used as a medium to bring people together for these projects, and Deveron Projects has a Walking Institute that commissions artists to make walks. Their annual Slow Marathon started in 2012 in collaboration with Ethiopian artist Mihret Kebede. Deveron Projects also runs a community kitchen and gardening projects. In 2013 Deveron Projects won Huntly the Creative Place Award, which recognises 'creativity across Scotland‚Äôs smaller communities'. Huntly also has Tin Hut Sessions, which offer open mic folk, blues, and traditional music gigs. Bothy ballads lie at the heart of Huntly and its surrounding areas' traditional music, and musicians Paul Anderson and Shona Donaldson both hail from the town. Sports There is salmon and trout fishing on the Rivers Deveron and Bogie, which are administered by the River Deveron Salmon Fisheries Board. Its other principal outdoor activities include golf, Nordic Skiing in Clashindarroch Forest, walking, mountain biking and Rugby. The local football team is Huntly F.C. Nearby is the start point of Scotland's longest horse ride trail, Highland Horseback, which runs 200 miles to the West Coast. The Eastern Tigers martial arts have a kickboxing club in Huntly and currently use the Pensioners Hall and the Stewarts Hall. They have produced national and international champions. History Settlement around the confluence of the Bogie and Deveron rivers dates back to the Neolithic period. Settlement remains and the remains of an Iron Age hillfort have been excavated on Battlehill on the outskirts of the town. During the first millennium CE the area was dominated by the Pictish culture. A very large Pictish settlement and vitrified hillfort was situated locally at Tap o' Noth in Strathbogie. The site represented an important strategic site controlling routes from Moray into Strathdon and Deeside. The first motte-and-bailey castle on this settlement was erected by Donchaid McDuff, the gaelic speaking 2nd Mormaer of Fife, c.1180. The lands were transferred to the Berwickshire Anglo-Norman family, the Gordons, in 1352 in retaliation for McDuff‚Äôs descendant, David of Strathbogie, defecting from Robert I to Edward I‚Äôs cause on the eve of the Battle of Bannockburn. The settlement at the confluence of the Bogie and the Deveron was known as Milton of Strathbogie or The Raws of Strathbogie until 1508. Despite the boggy lands in the vicinity at that time, the castle at Strathbogie became a key centre for the Gordons of Moray over the following centuries as the family built power through warfare and dynastic marriage, rising to be the dominant family in the North-East of Scotland ‚Äì the clan chief acquiring the informal title of Cock o' the North. As a result, a thriving settlement serving the evolving palace complex developed. The settlement became a burgh of barony in 1472. In 1508 the Gordons received a royal charter enabling them to rename Milton of Strathbogie & the castle to Huntly ‚Äì the name of their ancestral seat in Berwickshire. During the Scottish Reformation, the Gordons were among the leading Catholic families in the country and heavily embroiled in Mary, Queen of Scots‚Äô conflict with the reformed church and the protestant magnates. Huntly castle was bombarded and sacked in 1562 (by Mary) and in 1594 by James VI. After the restoration of Gordon titles, the town continued to develop during the 17th and 18th centuries both as a market town and an adjunct to the Gordons‚Äô palace with a wide range of merchants and artisans serving the surrounding countryside ‚Äì in the mid-17th century the town hosted 4 separate glovers. The adjacent parishes of Dunbennan and Kinnoir were consolidated into a single parish of Huntly in 1727, though each of these livings had been in the gift of the Marquess of Huntly for centuries. During this century, the Duke of Gordon also commenced redeveloping the town as a planned-town with grid-iron streets. The 18th centuries saw the development of the flax industry and associated cottage industries in heckling, spinning, bleaching and weaving, though the trade was inhibited in the longer term by poor transport infrastructure to Banff and Aberdeen. Smuggling whisky was also an important trade at this period until the industry was licensed in 1823. In the 19th century, following the post-Napoleonic slump in the linen trade, the town experienced another period of growth with the establishment of rail transport in 1845 coupled with a shift from peasant farming to capitalist agriculture. Huntly became an important market and shipping centre whilst its surrounding parishes depopulated. In 1836 the town and the Gordon estates passed to the Sussex-based 5th Duke of Richmond by inheritance. Ownership of the feu and much of the land and property remained in the ownership of the Dukes of Richmond and Gordon until August 1936 when all the property and feus in the town along with much surrounding farmland was sold at auction at Huntly Town Hall in order to pay death duties on the ducal estates. Though the town‚Äôs population has varied slightly over the 20th century ‚Äì with a net outward migration after the 2nd World War ‚Äì the town in 2018 had a population of 4,650. This compares with 4,229 in 1911. Significant demographic growth was over the course of the 19th century from 1000 in 1800 to 3,600 in 1861.  Notable people  * Ian Cameron, father of British Prime Minister, David Cameron, was from Glass, Huntly; he was born at Blairmore House. * Ronald Center (1913-1973), composer, lived there from 1943 until his death in 1973, teaching first at the Gordon Schools, then privately. * John Henderson (born 1973), a PDC darts player, is from Huntly. * James Legge (1815-1897), scholar and missionary to China, was born in Huntly and educated there and at King's College Aberdeen, before leaving to his first mission post in Malacca in 1839. Across the next 43 years he worked in Hong Kong translating all the classic books of the Confucian canon in a huge series of books, a set still considered to be the gold standard of English translations today. He frequently returned to Huntly across his life in China, bringing three young Chinese lads to live there and get \\"a good Scottish education\\" in 1845. By the time they returned to China in 1848 they had all been invited to meet Queen Victoria, then a lively young woman. Legge retired from his mission work in Hong Kong in 1873, was named the first Oxford Professor of Chinese in 1876, and lived there until his death. His father Ebenezer Legge had been Mayor of Huntly, and the Legge family home is still in use, on the main square. * George MacDonald (1824-1905), writer, and influence upon JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis. Some of his novels, especially the Robert Falconer and Alec Forbes of Howglen play partly in Huntly, even if the name of the town is changed, and give an introduction to the life in Huntly in the 19th century. * William Milne (1785-1822), born at Kennethmont near Huntly, was the second British Protestant missionary to China (following Robert Morrison). He was the founding headmaster of the first Anglo-Chinese school, Ying Wa College, in 1818 at Malacca. (This school was subsequently moved to Hong Kong by James Legge in 1843 and still exists.) * George Philip, (1800‚Äì1882) was a cartographer, map publisher and founder of the publishing house George Philip & Son Ltd.

The inhabitants paid a fixed tax rate of 33,3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards, fruit trees, sesame, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 5,000 ak√ße. 1/4 of the revenue went to a Waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 145 In 1838 Edward Robinson noted it on his travels in the area,Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, p. 392 as a Muslim village in the Gaza district.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 119 Socin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that Arak es-Sudan counted 29 houses and a population of 112, though the population count included men only.Socin, 1879, p. 144 Hartmann found that the village had 94 houses.Hartmann, 1883, p. 133 In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described it as a moderate-sized village situated on a plain.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 259.

Founded in 1871, SFAI is one of the oldest art schools in the United States and the oldest west of the Mississippi River. Approximately 400 undergraduates and 200 graduate students are enrolled. The institution is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD), and is a member of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD). History The roof terrace at SFAI's Chestnut Street Campus offers a scenic view over the city. The San Francisco Art Institute was established in 1871 with the formation of the San Francisco Art Association‚Äîa small but influential group of artists, writers, and community leaders, most notably, led by Virgil Macey Williams and first president Juan B. Wandesforde, with B.P. Avery, Edward Bosqui, Thomas Hill, and S.W. Shaw, who came together to promote regional art and artists, and to establish a school and museum to further and preserve what they saw as a new and distinct artistic tradition which had developed in the relative cultural isolation and unique landscape of the American West. By 1874 the SFAA had 700 regular members and 100 life members and had raised sufficient funds and the necessary momentum to launch an art school, which was named the California School of Design (CSD). Painter Virgil Macy Williams, who had spent nearly ten years studying with master painters in Italy and had taught at Harvard College before coming to San Francisco, became the school's first director and painting instructor‚Äîpositions he held until his sudden death in 1886.http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/cara/ucb/text/Cara_Volume_04.pdf#168 During Williams' tenure, the CSD developed a national reputation and amassed a significant collection of early California and western fine art as the foundation collected for a planned museum. In 1893, Edward Searles donated the Hopkins Mansion, one of the most palatial and elaborate Victorian mansions ever built, to the University of California in trust for the SFAA for \\"instruction in and illustration of the fine arts, music and literature.\\" Named the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art, it became San Francisco's first fine art and cultural center and housed both the CSD's campus and SFAA's art collection. Through this new affiliation, students of the University of California, Berkeley were able to enroll in classes at the CSD. In 1906 the devastating fire following the San Francisco earthquake destroyed the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art building, and the CSD and SFAA facilities, records and art collection. At the time, the replacement value of the building and its contents was estimated at $2.573 million. However, the combined amount of numerous insurance policies yielded less than $100,000 for rebuilding. Nevertheless, within a year, the SFAA built a new but comparatively modest campus in the same location, and adopted the name San Francisco Institute of Art. In 1916, the SFAA merged with the San Francisco Society of Artists and assumed directorship of the San Francisco Museum of Art at the Palace of Fine Arts, which was established to host the 1915 World's Fair, Panama-Pacific International Exposition. In addition, the school was renamed the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA) to better reflect its mission to promote, develop and preserve regional art and culture. In 1926 the school moved to 800 Chestnut Street, which remains the school's main campus . In 1930 Mexican muralist Diego Rivera was hired to paint The Making of a Fresco Showing the Building of a City, which is located in the student-directed art gallery. During its first 60 years, influential artists associated with the school included Eadweard Muybridge, photographer and pioneer of motion graphics; Maynard Dixon, painter of San Francisco's labor movement and of the landscape of the West; Henry Kiyama, whose Four Immigrants Manga was the first graphic novel published in the U.S.; Sargent Claude Johnson, one of the first African- American artists from California to achieve a national reputation; Louise Dahl-Wolfe, an innovative photographer whose work for Harper‚Äôs Bazaar in the 1930s defined a new American style of \\"environmental\\" fashion photography; Gutzon Borglum, the creator of the large-scale public sculpture known as Mt. Rushmore; Rudolf Hess, German Expressionist painter and art critic, and numerous others. After World War II ended (1945) the school became a nucleus for Abstract Expressionism, with faculty including Clyfford Still, Ad Reinhardt, Mark Rothko, David Park, Elmer Bischoff, and Clay Spohn. Although painting and sculpture remained the dominant mediums for many years, photography had also been among the course offerings. In 1946 Ansel Adams and Minor White established the first fine-art photography department, with Imogen Cunningham, Edward Weston, and Dorothea Lange among its instructors. In 1947 distinguished filmmaker Sydney Peterson began the first film courses at CSFA. In this spirit of advancement, in 1949 CSFA Director Douglas MacAgy organized an international conference, The Western Roundtable on Modern Art, which included Marcel Duchamp, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Gregory Bateson. The roundtable aimed to expose ‚Äúhidden assumptions‚Äù and to frame new questions about art. By the early 1950s San Francisco's North Beach had become the West Coast center of the Beat Movement, and music, poetry, and discourse were an intrinsic part of artists' lives. Collage artist Jess Collins renounced a career as a plutonium developer and enrolled at SFAI as a painting student. In 1953 he and his partner, poet Robert Duncan, along with painter Harry Jacobus, started the King Ubu Gallery, an important alternative space for art, poetry, and music. A distinctly Californian modern art soon emerged that fused abstraction, figuration, narrative, and jazz. SFAI faculty David Park, Elmer Bischoff, James Weeks, James Kelly, Frank Lobdell, and Richard Diebenkorn were now the leaders of the Bay Area Figurative Movement, informed by their experience of seeing local museum exhibitions of work by Edvard Munch, Max Beckmann, Edgar Degas, and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. Students at the school, including David Simpson, William T. Wiley, Robert Hudson, William Allan, Joan Brown, Manuel Neri, Carlos Villa, and Wally Hedrick, continued the investigation of new ideas and new materials, many becoming the core of the Funk art movement. Renamed San Francisco Art Institute in 1961, SFAI rejected the distinction between fine and applied arts. SFAI stood at the forefront of recognizing an expanded vocabulary of art-making that hybridized many practices including performance, conceptual art, new media, graphic arts, typography, and political and social documentary. Students in the early to mid-1960s included artists Ronald Davis, Robert Graham, Forrest Myers, Leo Valledor, Michael Heizer, Ronnie Landfield, Peter Reginato, Gary Stephan, and John Duff and in the late 1960s Annie Leibovitz, who would soon begin photographing for Rolling Stone magazine; Paul McCarthy, well known for his performance and sculpture works; and Charles Bigelow, who would be among the first typographers to design fonts for computers. Alumni Ruth-Marion Baruch and Pirkle Jones documented the early days of the Black Panther Party in northern California. In 1969, a new addition to the building by Paffard Keatinge-Clay added of studio space, a large theater/lecture hall, an outdoor amphitheater, galleries, and a cafe. Installation art, video, music, and social activism continued to inform much of the work of faculty and students in the 1970s and 1980s. The faculty during this period included George Kuchar, Gunvor Nelson, Howard Fried, Paul Kos, Angela Davis, Kathy Acker, Robert Colescott, and many other influential artists and writers. Among the students were a number of performance artists and musicians, including Karen Finley, whose performances challenged notions of femininity and political power, and Prairie Prince and Michael Cotten, who presented their first performance as the Tubes in the SFAI lecture hall, and became pioneers in the field of music video. The school became a hub for the Punk music scene, with bands such as the Mutants, the Avengers, and Romeo Void all started by SFAI students. Technology also became part of art practice: faculty Sharon Grace's Send/Receive project used satellite communications to create an interactive transcontinental performance, while Survival Research Laboratories, founded by student Mark Pauline, began staging large-scale outdoor performances of ritualized interactions among machines, robots, and pyrotechnics. Since the 1990s the studio and classroom have become increasingly connected to the world via public art and community actions. As students at SFAI, Barry McGee, Aaron Noble, and Rigo 23, among others, were part of the movement known as the Mission School, taking their graffiti-inspired art to the streets and walls of the city. Faculty and students have created site-specific projects in locations from the San Francisco waterfront (Ann Chamberlain and Walter Hood's monument to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade) to the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana, Mexico (a sculpture by artist Pedro Reyes and SFAI students for the U.S. Department of State's Art in Embassies program). Organizations like Artists' Television Access (ATA) and Root Division, founded by alumni, and SFAI's City Studio program engage and educate local communities and cultivate a vital artistic ecosystem. The school's history was recognized in 2016, when its campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =Financial problems= Due to a lack of a sizable endowment, declining enrollment rates, high real estate costs, and a reliance on campus property rental, which was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the school announced that it might close by the end of spring semester in 2020. The board and administration has suspended its degree programs but plans to continue offering classes and programs while discussing potential mergers with other institutions. The institute marked its 149th birthday on Thursday, March 26th, 2020, shortly after failed merger talks. Academics SFAI offers Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Master of Arts (MA), and Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degrees. SFAI also offers Low-Residency MFAs and Post- Baccalaureate certificates in Studio Art. =Photography= Founded by Ansel Adams in 1945, the Photography Department became the first program of its kind dedicated to exploring photography as a fine-art medium. Adams designed the school's darkrooms and attracted photographers for the original faculty, including Dorothea Lange, Imogen Cunningham, Minor White, and Morley Baer, who became Head of the Department after White's departure in 1953. =Painting= Throughout the SFAI Painting Department's history, it has been home to celebrated artists such as Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Richard Diebenkorn, Jay DeFeo, Fred Martin, Elmer Bischoff, David Park, David Simpson, Frank Lobdell, Roy De Forest, Joan Brown, Ronald Davis, William T. Wiley, Toba Khedoori, Barry McGee, Inez Storer and Kehinde Wiley among others and was central to movements such as Abstract Expressionism, Bay Area Figuration, Color Field, California Funk, and the Mission School. =New Genres= Howard Fried founded the performance and video department (now New Genres) at the San Francisco Art Institute. In the late 1970s, a long-lost collection of Eadweard Muybridge photographs was found and an auction of the materials financed the creation of the department ‚Äî and the purchase of two Portopak cameras. (More than a century before, the English artist had presented the first ever public showing of moving pictures on campus and apparently left something behind.) =Music= Among the many artist musicians who studied at SFAI are Jerry Garcia, guitarist in Grateful Dead; Dave Getz, drummer for Big Brother and the Holding Company and Country Joe and the Fish; Prairie Prince of The Tubes; Debora Iyall of Romeo Void; Freddy (aka Fritz) of the Mutants; Penelope Houston of the Avengers, Courtney Love, actress and rock musician; Entertainment Weekly, 1994: The Power of Love Jonathan Holland of Tussle; Devendra Banhart. Housing In Summer 2010, SFAI moved its housing program to two locations in Nob Hill: Sutter Hall at 717 Sutter Street, and Abby Hall at 630 Geary Street. In Fall 2019, the housing program will only occupy one location: Abby Hall at 630 Geary Street. Exhibitions and public programs Students are given direct access to exhibitions, lectures, symposia, films, and other unique interdisciplinary events. An integral part of campus life, such events connect students to the larger community of artists, art, and contemporary ideas. The Walter and McBean Galleries (on the 800 Chestnut Street campus) house exhibitions, workshops, and other alternative and experimental avenues for presenting work by international contemporary artists. Students also have the opportunity to show their own work in a number of spots on SFAI's two campuses, including the Diego Rivera Gallery. =Adaline Kent Award= Former board member (1947‚Äì1957), Adaline Kent was a sculptor and alumni of the school. Upon her death in 1957, she bequeathed $10,000 for the establishment of an annual award for a promising California Artist. Each year since 1957 the prize was awarded by the San Francisco Art Institute Artists' Committee. Winners included Ron Nagle (1978), Wally Hedrick (1985), Mildred Howard (1991), Clare Rojas (2004), and as the final award, Scott Williams (2005).

A leading figure in Chicago jazz, he also played piano and sang. Early years Condon was born in Goodland, Indiana, the son of John and Margaret (n√©e McGraw) Condon. He grew up in Momence, Illinois, and Chicago Heights, Illinois, where he attended St. Agnes and Bloom High School. After playing ukulele, he switched to banjo and was a professional musician by 1921. When he was 15 years old, he received his first union card in Waterloo, Iowa.  Career  He was based in Chicago for most of the 1920s, and played with such jazz notables as Bix Beiderbecke, Jack Teagarden, and Frank Teschemacher. He and Red McKenzie formed the Chicago Rhythm Kings in 1925. While in Chicago, Condon and other white musicians would go to Lincoln Gardens to watch and learn from King Oliver and his band. They later would frequent the Sunset Caf√© to see Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five for the same reasons. In 1928, Condon moved to New York City. He frequently arranged jazz sessions for various record labels, sometimes playing with the artists he brought to the recording studios, including Louis Armstrong and Thomas Fats Waller. He organised racially integrated recording sessions‚Äîwhen these were still rare‚Äîwith Waller, Armstrong and Henry 'Red' Allen. He played with the band of Red Nichols for a time. Later, from 1938 he had a long association with Milt Gabler's Commodore Records. A handful of records were issued under his own name: a July 28, 1928 two-song session was recorded for OKeh, but only issued in England. On October 30, 1928, an OKeh was issued as \\"Eddie Condon and his Footwarmers\\", featuring Jack Teagarden. A further session on February 8, 1929 yielded a record issued under the name \\"Eddie Hot Shots\\" and issued on Victor's hot dance series. In 1933, a further two sessions were recorded for Brunswick consisting of 6 recordings, only 2 of which were released in the US. From 1938 on, Condon recorded for Commodore and one session for Decca. From the late 1930s on he was a regular at the Manhattan jazz club Nick's. The sophisticated variation on Dixieland music which Condon and his colleagues created there came to be nicknamed \\"Nicksieland.\\" By this time, his regular circle of musical associates included Wild Bill Davison, Bobby Hackett, George Brunies, Edmond Hall, and Pee Wee Russell. In 1939, he appeared with \\"Bobby Hacket and Band\\" in the Warner Brothers & Vitaphone film musical short-subject, On the Air. Condon did a series of jazz radio broadcasts, Eddie Condon's Jazz Concerts, from New York's Town Hall during 1944‚Äì45 which were nationally popular. These recordings survive, and have been issued on the Jazzology label. From 1945 through 1967 he ran his own New York jazz club, Eddie Condon's, first located on West 3rd Street in Greenwich Village, then 52nd Street near Sixth Avenue, on the present site of the CBS headquarters building; then later, on the south side of East 56th Street, east of Second Avenue. In the 1950s Condon recorded a sequence of classic albums for Columbia Records. The musicians involved in these albums, and at Condon's club, included Wild Bill Davison, Bobby Hackett (cornet), Billy Butterfield (trumpet), Edmond Hall, Peanuts Hucko, Pee Wee Russell, Bob Wilber (clarinet), Cutty Cutshall, Lou McGarity, George Brunies (trombone), Bud Freeman (tenor sax), Gene Schroeder, Dick Cary, Ralph Sutton (piano), Bob Casey, Walter Page, Jack Lesberg, Al Hall (bass), George Wettling, Buzzy Drootin, Cliff Leeman (drums). Condon toured Britain in 1957 with a band including Wild Bill Davison, Cutty Cutshall, Gene Schroeder and George Wettling. His last tour was in 1964, when he took a band to Australia and Japan. Condon's men, on that tour, were top mainstream jazz musicians: Buck Clayton (trumpet), Pee Wee Russell (clarinet), Vic Dickenson (trombone), Bud Freeman (tenor sax), Dick Cary (piano and alto horn), Jack Lesberg (bass), Cliff Leeman (drums), Jimmy Rushing (vocals). Billy Banks, a vocalist who had recorded with Condon and Pee Wee Russell in 1932, and had lived in obscurity in Japan for many years, turned up at one of the 1964 concerts: Pee Wee asked him \\"have you got any more gigs?\\". In 1948, Condon's autobiography We Called It Music was published. Eddie Condon's Treasury of Jazz (1956) was a collection of articles co-edited by Condon and Richard Gehman. A latter-day collaborator, clarinetist Kenny Davern, described a Condon gig: \\"It was always a thrill to get a call from Eddie and with a gig involved even more so. I remember eating beforehand with Bernie (Previn, trumpet) and Lou (McGarity, trombone) and everyone being in good spirits. There was a buzz on, we'd all had a taste and there was a great feel to the music.\\"Liner notes, A Night With Eddie Condon, by Kenny Davern. Arbors Records). Condon toured and appeared at jazz festivals until 1971. Personal life Condon married fashion copywriter Phyllis Smith in 1942. They had two daughters. Death On August 4, 1973, Condon died of a bone disease at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, New York. He was 67. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.

Its roster included Coleman Hawkins, Earl Hines, Erroll Garner, and Lester Young. At age 14, Thiele was a disc jockey for his own jazz radio show, edited his own jazz magazine, and played clarinet with bands in New York City. He started Signature at age 17. Thiele was head producer and president of the label. Its musical director was orchestra leader Ray Bloch. Some sources recite that Signature closed in 1948. However, other sources indicate that the label continued to release records into the 50s, but that by the late 50s it was moribund. Having freelanced and produced for Decca Records and its Coral and Brunswick labels, and served as vice president for A&R; for Dot Records, Thiele announced in May 1959 that he was reactivating the Signature label. The venture appears to have been in partnership with Steve Allen, one of the co-owners of Hanover Records, who brought the label into the arrangement. The new company was known as Hanover-Signature Records. Orchestra leader Milton DeLugg, who had worked with Thiele at Dot and Coral, was named musical director. The company continued to release records on both labels. Thiele produced records for his then-wife, singer Teresa Brewer, as late as 1983. Hanover releases continued into 1961.

Her inheritance from his estate included $20 million ($ million in ) as well as a 50% holding in the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, which made her one of the wealthiest women in the world at the time. She is best known for using her vast fortune to continue construction on the Winchester mansion in San Jose, California, for 38 years.Ignoffo, Mary Jo. \\"Captive of the Labyrinth: Sarah L. Winchester, Heiress to the Rifle Fortune.\\" Columbia, Mo. : Univ. of Missouri Press, 2010. See p. 112. Popular legends, which began during her lifetime, held that she was convinced she was cursed, and the only way to alleviate it was to add on to her California home. Since her death, the sprawling Winchester Mystery House has become a popular tourist attraction, known for its staircases that lead to nowhere and its many winding corridors and doors leading to walls, or big falls. Early life She was born the daughter of Leonard Pardee and his wife Sarah W. (n√©e Burns), in Summer 1839 in New Haven, Connecticut. On September 30, 1862, in New Haven, Sarah married William Wirt Winchester, the only son of Oliver Winchester, the owner of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. The couple was married in 1862 and had one daughter, Annie Pardee Winchester, who was born on June 15, 1866 and died on July 25, 1866 of marasmus. The couple had no more children. Her father in law died in 1880, and her husband William died of tuberculosis in March 1881. Thus she received an inheritance of $20 million ($ million in ). In addition, Winchester received approximately 50 percent ownership in the Winchester company and an income of $1,000 a day (). Other properties In 1888 Winchester purchased 140 acres of land, the majority of what is now downtown Los Altos, California, to use as a ranch. She also purchased a farmhouse, now known as the Winchester-Merriman House, for her sister and brother-in-law. The house is listed on the Historic Resources Inventory of the Los Altos Historical Commission.The farmhouse in Los Altos In the 1920s Mrs Winchester also maintained a houseboat on San Francisco Bay at Burlingame, California, which became known as \\"Sarah's Ark\\", as it was reputedly kept there as insurance against her fear of a second great flood, such as the Biblical one experienced by Noah and his family, but a more mundane answer is that many people of her social standing in California at that time had houseboats or yachts. The \\"Ark\\" was located near the eucalyptus grove at Winchester Road, south of what was to become the intersection of Anza Boulevard and U.S. Highway 101. The ark was destroyed by fire in 1929.Burlingame Centennial 1908-2008, Joanne Garrison Death On September 5, 1922, she died in her sleep of heart failure. A service was held in Palo Alto, California, and her remains lay at Alta Mesa Cemetery until they were transferred, along with those of her sister, to New Haven, Connecticut.MaryJo Ignoffo, Captive of the Labyrinth She was buried next to her husband and their infant child in Evergreen Cemetery, New Haven, Connecticut. She left a will written in thirteen sections, which she signed thirteen times. The belongings in Winchester Mystery House were left to her niece, Marian I. Marriott, who took what she wanted and auctioned the rest off. According to the current owners of the house, it took movers eight truckloads a day for six and a half weeks to empty the entire house of furniture. Her biographer, however, has been unable to find any evidence supporting this claim.Ignoffo, Mary Jo. \\"Captive of the Labyrinth: Sarah L. Winchester, Heiress to the Rifle Fortune.\\" Columbia, Mo. : Univ. of Missouri Press, 2010. See p. 207. They did not mention the former home of the furniture at the auction, which makes it impossible to track down today. The furnishings that exist in the home today for tours are donations or loans that reflect the period. Because she was such a private person, no known interior photographs were taken so the exact furnishings are a mystery. (The only exception is a set of bulletin cabinets in the linen room.) Following her death, the home was auctioned to the highest bidder, who then turned it into an attraction for the public; the first tourists walked through the house in February 1923, five months after Winchester died. Legacy *The Santa Clara-Los Gatos Boulevard in front of the house was later renamed Winchester Boulevard, after the house. Today, the house is open to the public every day except Christmas Day.

Officially known as Monument 5, this statue is thought to represent a kneeling \\"baby-face\\" figure. La Venta is a pre-Columbian archaeological site of the Olmec civilization located in the present-day Mexican state of Tabasco. Some of the artifacts have been moved to the museum \\"Parque - Museo de La Venta\\", which is in nearby Villahermosa, the capital of Tabasco. Overview The Olmec were one of the first civilizations to develop in the Americas. Chronologically, the history of the Olmecs can be divided into the Early Formative (1800-900 BCE), Middle Formative (900-400 BCE) and Late Formative (400 BCE-200AD). The Olmecs are known as the \\"mother culture\\" of Mesoamerica, meaning that the Olmec civilization was the first culture that spread and influenced Mesoamerica. The spread of Olmec culture eventually led to cultural features found throughout all Mesoamerican societies. Rising from the sedentary agriculturalists of the Gulf Lowlands as early as 1600 BCE in the Early Formative period, the Olmecs held sway in the Olmec heartland, an area on the southern Gulf of Mexico coastal plain, in Veracruz and Tabasco. Prior to the site of La Venta, the first Olmec site of San Lorenzo dominated the modern day state of Veracruz (1200-900 BCE). Roughly long and wide, with the Coatzalcoalcos River system running through the middle, the heartland is home to the major Olmec sites of La Venta, San Lorenzo Tenochtitl√°n, Laguna de los Cerros, and Tres Zapotes. The Olmec Heartland, showing La Venta.By no later than 1200 BCE, San Lorenzo had emerged as the most prominent Olmec center. While a layer of occupation at La Venta dates to 1200 BCE, La Venta did not reach its apogee until the decline of San Lorenzo, after 900 BCE. After 500 years of pre-eminence, La Venta was all but abandoned by the beginning of the fourth century BCE. Located on an island in a coastal swamp overlooking the then-active R√≠o Palma, La Venta probably controlled a region between the Mezcalapa and Coatzacoalcos rivers. The site itself is about inland at an elevation of less than 10 meters above sea level with the island consisting of slightly more than of dry land, resting on the largest alluvial plane in Mexico. The humid tropical climate of La Venta has an average annual temperature of 26 degrees Celsius and an average annual rainfall of 2,000 millimeters. La Venta is located at the nexus of four different ecosystems: marshes, mangrove swamps, tropical forest, and the Gulf of Mexico. \\"There was a large resident population at the site, a number of specialists not dedicated to food production, and political, religious, economic, and/or military relations with other sites within its area of influence.\\" Unfortunately, few, if any, of the residential structures surrounding the large centers of the city have survived. The main part of the site is a complex of clay constructions stretched out for in a north-south direction, although the site is oriented 8¬∞ west of north. The urbanized zone may have covered an area as large of 2 km2. This particular site layout is the way the city was from 600 ‚Äì 400 BCE, which is when the final Olmec occupation occurred. This site is particularly fascinating because of its layout‚Äînot only does Complex A face within 8 degrees of true North, but the east and west sides of the site are almost identical, showing bilateral symmetry. This is perhaps related to religion (it‚Äôs fairly speculative, at this point) but it certainly shows a high level of sophistication and city-planning. Unlike later Maya or Aztec cities, La Venta was built from earth and clay‚Äîthere was little locally abundant stone for the construction. Large basalt stones were brought in from the Tuxtla Mountains, but these were used nearly exclusively for monuments including the colossal heads, the \\"altars\\" (actually thrones), and various stelae. For example, the basalt columns that surround Complex A were quarried from Punta Roca Partida, on the Gulf coast north of the San Andres Tuxtla volcano. \\"Little more than half of the ancient city survived modern disturbances enough to map accurately.\\" Today, the entire southern end of the site is covered by a petroleum refinery and has been largely demolished, making excavations difficult or impossible. Many of the site's monuments are now on display in the archaeological museum and park in the city of Villahermosa, Tabasco. Major features of La Venta Archaeological site plan for La Venta. Notice how the site is aligned slightly west - 8¬∞ west - of north. Several Mesoamerican sites have this alignment, including San Jose Mogote. Complex C, The Great Pyramid. Complex A. One of the three buried Mosaics or Pavements from La Venta, consisting of nearly 500 blocks of serpentine. La Venta was a civic and ceremonial center. While it may have included as-yet-undiscovered regal residences, habitation for the non-regal elite and the commoners were located at outlying sites such as San Andr√©s. Instead of dwellings, La Venta is dominated by a restricted sacred area (Complex A), the Great Pyramid (Complex C), and the large plaza to their south. As a ceremonial center, La Venta contains an elaborate series of buried offerings and tombs, as well as monumental sculptures. These stone monuments, stelae, and \\"altars\\" were carefully distributed amongst the mounds and platforms. The mounds and platforms were built largely from local sands and clays. It is assumed that many of these platforms were once topped with wooden structures, which have long since disappeared. =Complex C (The Great Pyramid)= Complex C, \\"The Great Pyramid,\\" is the central building in the city layout, is constructed almost entirely out of clay, and is easily seen from far away. The structure is built on top of a closed-in platform‚Äîthis is where Blom and La Farge discovered Altars 2 and 3, thereby discovering La Venta and the Olmec civilization. A carbon sample from a burned area of the Structure C-1's surface resulted in the date of 394 ¬± 30 BCE. One of the earliest pyramids known in Mesoamerica, the Great Pyramid is high and contains an estimated 100,000 cubic meters of earth fill. The current conical shape of the pyramid was once thought to represent nearby volcanoes or mountains, but recent work by Rebecca Gonzalez Lauck has shown that the pyramid was in fact a rectangular pyramid with stepped sides and inset corners, and the current shape is most likely due to 2,500 years of erosion. The pyramid itself has never been excavated, but a magnetometer survey in 1967 found an anomaly high on the south side of the pyramid. Speculation ranges from a section of burned clay to a cache of buried offerings to a tomb. =Complex A= Complex A is a mound and plaza group located just to the north of the Great Pyramid (Complex C). The centerline of Complex A originally oriented to Polaris (true north) which indicates the Olmec had some knowledge of astronomy. Surrounded by a series of basalt columns, which likely restricted access to the elite, it was erected in a period of four construction phases that span over four centuries (1000 ‚Äì 600 BCE). Beneath the mounds and plazas were found a vast array of offerings and other buried objects, more than 50 separate caches by one count, including buried jade, polished mirrors made of iron-ores, and five large \\"Massive Offerings\\" of serpentine blocks. It is estimated that Massive Offering 3 contains 50 tons of carefully finished serpentine blocks, covered by 4,000 tons of clay fill. Also unearthed in Complex A were three rectangular mosaics (also known as \\"Pavements\\") each roughly and each consisting of up to 485 blocks of serpentine. These blocks were arranged horizontally to form what has been variously interpreted as an ornate Olmec bar-and-four-dots motif, the Olmec Dragon, a very abstract jaguar mask, a cosmogram, or a symbolic map of La Venta and environs. Not intended for display, soon after completion these pavements were covered over with colored clay and then many feet of earth. Five formal tombs were discovered within Complex A, one with a sandstone sarcophagus carved with what seemed to be an crocodilian earth monster. Diehl states that these tombs \\"are so elaborate and so integrated to the architecture that it seems clear that Complex A really was a mortuary complex dedicated to the spirits of deceased rulers\\". Other notable artifacts within Complex A include: * Monument 19. This relief sculpture is the earliest known example of the feathered serpent in Mesoamerica. * Offering 4. =Complex B= South of the Great Pyramid lies Complex B. Whereas Complex A was apparently restricted to the elite, the plaza of Complex B seems to be built specifically for large public gatherings. This plaza is just south of the Great Pyramid, east of the Complex B platforms, and west of the huge raised platform referred to as the Stirling Acropolis.The Stirling Acropolis is named in honor of Matthew Stirling, the archaeologist who first surveyed La Venta in the 1940s. This plaza is nearly long and over wide. A small platform is situated in the center of the plaza. This layout has led researchers to propose that the platforms surrounding the plaza functioned as stages where ritual drama was enacted for viewers within the plaza.Grove (1999, p.275) discusses ritual drama. Tate (2008, pp.32‚Äì37) makes the case that the monumental art itself recount a creation narrative. These rituals were likely related to the \\"altars\\", monuments, and the stelae surrounding and within the plaza. These monuments, including Colossal Head 1 (Monument 1), were of such a large size and were placed in such a position that they could convey their messages to many viewers at once. =Complex E= Though there are not any actual houses remaining in this area (or anywhere at La Venta) \\"a chemical evaluation of the soil revealed unusual concentrations of phosphate, indicating the possibility it had been a residential zone.\\" =Summary= The arrangement of the mounds, platforms, complexes, and monumental artifacts at La Venta created a unique civil and ceremonial center that, in the words of Rebecca Gonzalez-Lauck, constitutes \\"one of the earliest examples of large-scale ideological communications through the interaction of architecture and sculpture\\". Monumental artifacts at La Venta Olmec colossal head from La Venta. Now in Villahermosa, this head is 2¬Ω m high (9 ft) and is officially known as Monument 1. =Colossal heads= Certainly the most famous of the La Venta monumental artifacts are the four colossal heads. Seventeen colossal heads have been unearthed in the Olmec area, four of them at La Venta, officially named Monuments 1 through 4. Three of the heads‚ÄîMonuments 2, 3, and 4‚Äîwere found roughly 150 meters north of Complex A, which is itself just north of the Great Pyramid. These heads were in a slightly irregular row, facing north. The other colossal head‚ÄîMonument 1 (shown at left) - is a few dozen meters south of the Great Pyramid. The La Venta heads are thought to have been carved by 700 BCE, but possibly as early as 850 BCE, while the San Lorenzo heads are credited to an earlier period. The colossal heads can measure up to in height and weigh several tons. The sheer size of the stones causes a great deal of speculation on how the Olmec were able to move them. The major basalt quarry for the colossal heads at La Venta was found at Cerro Cintepec in the Tuxtla Mountains, over 80 km away. Each of the heads wears headgear reminiscent of 1920s-style American football helmets, although each is unique in its decoration. The consensus is that the heads likely represent mighty Olmec rulers.

Monument 19, from La Venta, the earliest known representation of a feathered serpent in Mesoamerica. Courtesy George & Audrey Delange =Altars 4 & 5= Seven basalt \\"altars\\" were found at La Venta, including Altar 4 and Altar 5. These altars, roughly 2 meters high and twice as wide, feature an elaborately dressed and sculpted figure on the center front. The figure on Altar 4 is sitting inside what appears to be a cave or the mouth of a fantastic creature, holding a rope which wraps around the base of the altar to his right and left. On the left side, the rope is connected to a seated bas-relief figure. The right side is eroded away but is thought to be similar to the scene on the right. The consensus today is that these \\"altars\\" are thrones on which the Olmec rulers were seated during important rituals or ceremonies. This leads many researchers to interpret the figure at the front of Altar 4 as a ruler, who is contacting or being helped by his ancestors, the figures on either side of the altar. Alternatively, some believe the side figures to be bound captives. Altar 5 faces Altar 4 across Structure D-8 (one of the dozens of mounds at La Venta, the remains of platforms). Altar 5 is similar in design and size to Altar 4, except that the central figure holds an inert, perhaps dead, were- jaguar baby. The left side of Altar 5 features bas-reliefs of humans holding quite lively were-jaguar babies. Like the Altar 4, the right side of Altar 5 has been defaced. Some have seen child sacrifice echoed in the limp were- jaguar baby on the front of Altar 5. Others, however, view the tableau as a myth of human emergence or as story of a spiritual journey. Although less striking and displaying a lesser degree of craftsmanship, Altars 2 and 3 are similar to Altars 4 and 5. They each show a central figure, one with a baby and one without, and they sit facing each other on the southern edge of the Great Pyramid. Social structure La Venta was the cultural capital of the Olmec concentration in the region. It contained a \\"concentration of power,\\" as reflected by the sheer enormity of the architecture and the extreme value of the artifacts uncovered. La Venta is perhaps the largest Olmec city and it was controlled and expanded by an extremely complex hierarchical system with a king, as the ruler and the elites below him. Priests had power and influence over life and death and likely great political sway as well. Unfortunately, not much is known about the political or social structure of the Olmec, though new dating techniques might, at some point, reveal more information about this elusive culture. It is possible that the signs of status exist in the artifacts recovered at the site such as depictions of feathered headdresses or of individuals wearing a mirror on their chest or forehead. \\"High-status objects were a significant source of power in the La Venta polity political power, economic power, and ideological power. They were tools used by the elite to enhance and maintain rights to rulership.\\" It has been estimated that La Venta would need to be supported by a population of at least 18,000 people during its principal occupation. To add to the mystique of La Venta, the alluvial soil did not preserve skeletal remains, so it is difficult to observe differences in burials. However, colossal heads provide proof that the elite had some control over the lower classes, as their construction would have been extremely labor-intensive. \\"Other features similarly indicate that many laborers were involved.\\" In addition, excavations over the years have discovered that different parts of the site were likely reserved for elites and other parts for non-elites. This segregation of the city indicates that there must have been social classes and therefore social inequality. Burials Several burials have been found at La Venta, especially in Mound A, but none have skeletal remains as the environment is too humid for organic preservation. \\"Organic materials do not preserve well in the acidic soils of La Venta. The only organics recovered at the site include traces of long bones, a burned skullcap, a few milk teeth, a shark's tooth, and stingray spines‚Äîall found in the basalt tomb [Structure A-2].\\" Offerings of jade celts and figures seem to be commonplace and were likely concentrated in burials (though this cannot be confirmed because there are no human remains still present). Artifacts, such as jade earspools, beads, pendants, spangles, plaques, and other jewelry, were found in plenty at burial sites; however it is difficult to tell if they were worn or placed in the grave as burial goods. =Structure A-2= Structure A-2 (Mound A) is an earthen platform thought to be a burial site (a \\"funerary chamber\\"). Inside the platform, researchers discovered badly preserved bones covered in a red pigment, cinnabar, a substance used in similar Mesoamerican cultures to denote status. Also found were jade artifacts, figurines and masks, as well as polished obsidian mirrors. Mirrors are also suspected to be a mark of rank among the Olmec, as stelae and other monuments display leaders and priests wearing them on their chest and on their foreheads. \\"Throughout the layer [uncovered by Stirling in 1942] were copious unrestorable traces of organic material. The red cinnabar lay in a fashion which gave the impression that it had been inside of wrapped bundles. Probably the bodies had been thus wrapped before interment.\\" =Urn burials= Rust (2008) discovered \\"urn burials\\" in Complex E (residential area) where fragments of bone and teeth were buried in clay pots. \\"The fill immediately around this large urn was clean, yellow sand, and the urn was covered with an inverted fine-paste orange bowl with flaring walls; the bowl's interior was painted red and incised with the double-line-break pattern on the inside rim.\\" Religion and ideology \\"For decades, certain scholars have used shamanism as an explanatory paradigm for considering the monuments of La Venta... one of the most important ceremonial-civic centers of the Middle Formative era.Tate 2007, p. 2 Most of what is known about Olmec religion is speculative, but certain patterns do emerge at La Venta that are certainly symbolic and might have ritual meaning. For example, the crossed bands symbol, an X in a rectangular box, is often repeated in stone at La Venta, other Olmec sites, and continued to have significance to the cultures inspired by the Olmec. It often appears in conjunction with the maize deity and so might have connection with subsistence. The artifacts discovered at La Venta have been crucial to starting to understand Olmec religion and ideology. For example, hematite and iron-ore mirror fragments have been discovered in abundance at La Venta. Mirrors were an incredibly important part of Olmec society, used in both rituals and daily life. Celts, or \\"pseudo-axes,\\" are extremely common in both burials and offerings. It is unclear whether these artifacts were actually used in any practical way or if their meaning is ritual or symbolic. Most are smooth, but quite a few are decorated with what has been interpreted as representing religious symbolism. Such celts and other jade artifacts were offered to deities during ceremonies at La Venta and the belief in supernatural beings is evidenced in Olmec artifacts. However, it is difficult to tell which important figures remaining on the stone monuments and artifacts are gods and which are human leaders. In fact, there might have been little difference between the divine and the Olmec king, in their ideology. Structures at La Venta show that \\"various architectural-sculptural canons were firmly established‚Äîcanons that were, in essence, used in civic-ceremonial constructions throughout the cultural history of ancient Middle America.\\" In other words, most of what we know about the Olmec, from La Venta, comes from the architecture and artifacts left behind and from these clues it can be discerned that Maya and Aztec culture and ideology was heavily influenced by the Olmec \\"mother culture.\\" There is a definite connection between animals and spirituality among the Olmec, especially with animal characteristics combined with human features. This is represented in Olmec \\"art\\" and those with elite status would have worn elaborate headdresses of feathers and other animal forms.Tate 2007 Ocean creatures were also sacred to the Olmec‚ÄîPohl (2005) found shark teeth and sting ray remains at feasting sites at San Andres and it is clear that those at La Venta shared in the same ideology. \\"Zoomorphic forms reference sharks and birds, and both collections contain representations of the quincunx symbol, a conceptualization of the cosmos in Mesoamerican thought.\\" \\"Given the lack of written documents in Formative Mesoamerica, there is no foolproof strategy for interpreting Olmec visual culture.\\" Tate 2007, p. 4 However, it is almost certain that the Olmec had some form of a writing system that utilized symbols, as evidenced in the cylinder seal and other forms of writing found at nearby elite-center, San Andres. Agriculture and economy The wild flora and fauna greatly varied at La Venta and mostly consisted of seafood, deer, and a variety of small animals, as well as many wild plants. The only animals domesticated by the Olmec were dogs and, therefore, La Venta and surrounding areas largely depended on wild game. However, the rich, alluvial soil along the river banks allowed for multiple harvests every year and the land, in general, was quite bountiful. \\"Evidence has been found for corn (Zea mais) of teosinte size associated with ceramic material dated to 1750 BCE.\\" Maize was the primary domesticated food source and Seinfeld's (2007) study of feasting at the nearby sub-city of San Andres uncovered likely maize use in beverages, as well as cocoa. Basalt rock was brought in from the Tuxtla Mountains to make stone monuments. Whether or not this is an example of trade with another culture is uncertain. La Venta had a strong concentration of specialized craftsmen and so it is entirely possible that more goods were exported than imported. This local exchange, and the resulting relationship system, is important, though, because it increased and consolidated the power of the elites with luxury goods and feasting foods like cacao and maize beer. \\"Participation in regional and long-distance exchange networks provided the La Venta ruling elite with a significant source of legitimizing power.\\" Discovery and excavation Frans Blom and Oliver La Farge made the first detailed descriptions of La Venta during their 1925 expedition, sponsored by Tulane University. Originally La Venta was thought to be a Mayan site. It wasn't until more sophisticated radiocarbon techniques were developed in the 1950s that Olmec sites were irrefutably dated as preceding the Maya. La Venta was first excavated by Matthew Stirling and Philip Drucker (assisted by Waldo Wedel in 1943, due to Drucker's military service during WWII) between 1940 and 1943, resulting in several articles by Stirling and in 1952 a two-volume monograph by Drucker. Stirling is sometimes credited with identifying the Olmec civilization; although some Olmec sites and monuments had been known earlier, it was Stirling's work that put the Olmec culture into context. This first excavation was funded by the National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Institution and focused on collecting samples using stratipits. In 1955, Drucker led a new excavation, funded again by the National Geographic Society, concentrating on Complex A and finally reaching the subsoil at the site, established stratigraphy to discover the constructional history. They discovered more jade artifacts, which were interpreted as ritual offerings, as well as pottery shards. The findings were published by Drucker, Robert Heizer and Robert Squier, (who were also assisted by Eduardo Contreras and Pierre Agrinier) in 1959. At this point most of the site was still unexcavated and in a strongly worded passage Heizer reported that the site was inadequately protected by the Mexican government and a wave of illegal excavations followed the departure of the archaeologists, as well as damage by urban sprawl, the national oil company, Pemex, and the removal of large monuments to museums (without leaving markers as to their original positions). Several subsequent excavations followed through the 1960s, funded by generous grants from the National Geographic Society. On their return in 1967, Drucker and Heizer saw that, as others had already claimed, the vegetation previously covering the mound, as well as their own assumptions, had led to them previously publishing a completely wrong account of its shape. It was in fact a round fluted cone with ten ridges and depressions around it, rather than the sloping rectangle, leading to a flat platform that they had assumed. Possibly the shape was intended to match or represent the mountains nearby. They also obtained better carbon samples in order to achieve one of the key goals of the excavation of La Venta‚Äîproving that the Olmec were a distinct and separate culture that pre-dates the first Maya settlements. Rebecca Gonzalez-Lauck led an INAH (Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia) team on several digs at La Venta in the 1980s. Her team focused on mapping the site and \\"ended and reversed the urban encroachment on the archaeological site of La Venta and created a program of protection, restoration, and research.\\" Their efforts have opened the site to a new generation of graduate students and other anthropologists, who continue to uncover new evidence about the mysterious Olmec. A ceramic cylinder was recovered from the nearby San Andr√©s La Venta site that dates to around 650 BCE that brings evidence to the argument that a writing system existed at this site. A bird image is connected to two glyphs on speech scrolls that represent the date 3 Ajaw on the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar. The seal increases the likelihood that a writing system existed as well as a 260-day calendar during this time period.Archaeology of Native North America, 2010, Dean R. Snow, Prentice-Hall, New York. pp. 146 Chronology ‚ÄúBecause of extremely poor viewing conditions in the tropical rainforest, different parts of La Venta were discovered piecemeal, and it was decades before scholars realized that all the platforms and stone sculptures found in the vicinity were part of a single site, an ancient city that was occupied from 900-400 BCE.‚Äù Phases I- IV are dated based on radiocarbon dates from Complex A, with approximately one hundred years between each phase. Unfortunately, excavating Complex A led to the destruction of the original integrity of the site and has made it difficult to go back and re-verify the dates. This is why La Venta has a rather loose chronology that cannot be made any more definitive. Phase I‚Äîdated with five radiocarbon samples (from the stratigraphy at Complex A) that have the average age of 2770 ¬± 134 years old (814 BCE +/- 134 years) Phase II‚Äîdated with a single sample at 804 BCE Phase III‚Äîno radiocarbon dates Phase IV‚Äîno radiocarbon dates, from Post-Phase IV dates, Heizer and Drucker estimated the end of Phase IV somewhere between 450 and 325 BCE Post-Phase IV‚Äîtwo samples average 2265 years old (309 BCE) Conclusion: The La Venta site was used from (approximately) 800- 400 BCE, during the Formative Period. Complex A at the site was built and rebuilt during this period and this date range comes from carbon samples from construction fills. Rebecca Gonzalez Lauck asserts that the Olmec concentration at La Venta occurred from 1200 ‚Äì 400 BCE and the overriding point seems to be that an exact chronology has proved to be elusive. Threats to La Venta On January 11, 2009, 23 ancient Olmec sculptures were damaged with a mixture of salt water, grape juice, and oil by a group attempting to perform a supposed pre-Columbian ritual to bring about peace and world-healing. The group of two Mexicans, Roberto Conde D√≠az and Jos√© Pablo Megenes Jasso, and an American citizen, Wanda Ivette Aguilar were alleged members of a Christian sect called \\"Nueva Generaci√≥n\\". The incident prompted Mexican legislators to draft legislation \\"that would increase fines and jail time for vandalism and looting of monuments and archaeological sites.\\" Notes See also * Olmec figurines * Olmec Offering 4 at La Venta * San Andr√©s, one of La Venta's well-studied satellite communities * Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures * List of Mesoamerican pyramids * List of megalithic sites * History of Mexico References : : : : : : : : External links *The DeLanges visit La Venta - photos of Complex A Category:Mesoamerican sites Category:Archaeology of Mexico Category:Archaeological sites in Mexico Category:Ruins in Mexico Category:Olmec sites Category:Former populated places in Mexico Category:Archaeological sites in Tabasco ","title":"La Venta"},{"id":"336436","text":"The Communist Party USA and its allies played an important role in the United States labor movement, particularly in the 1930s and 1940s, but never succeeded, with rare exceptions, either in bringing the labor movement around to its agenda of fighting for socialism and full workers' control over industry, or in converting their influence in any particular union into membership gains for the Party. The CP has had only negligible influence in labor since its supporters' defeat in internal union political battles in the aftermath of World War II and the CIO's expulsion of the unions in which they held the most influence in 1950. After the expulsion of the Communists, organized labor in the United States began a steady decline. Historians disagree why the union movement never formed a labor party and why American workers have never embraced socialist parties in any numbers in the last ninety years. Some have argued that a strain of American exceptionalism made U.S. workers resistant to parties that emphasized class struggle; others have attributed the left's failure to its own successes in building strong unions, but at the cost of downplaying its own political and social agendas for the sake of unity or short-term gains. Others take just the opposite position: that the left lost its power to lead the labor movement by its ideological zig-zags. The CP's history within the labor movement can support all of these theses. CPUSA's founding and early years The Communist Party of the USA was founded in 1919, out of two groups who broke from the Socialist Party of America when it refused to join the Comintern. The original core of the CP believed that the triumph of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia meant that the revolution was at hand in the West as well. The CP's initial attitude towards unions reflected that millenarian view. At the time of its founding, according to a leader of the party, \\"it would have been difficult to gather a half dozen delegates who knew anything about the trade union movement.\\" The Party also became a largely clandestine organization during the immediate post-war years, as the Palmer Raids led to the arrest and deportation of thousands of Party members. The CP at that time looked on the American Federation of Labor as an enemy to be destroyed in order to eliminate the temptations of reformism rather than revolution. They also looked down on most trade union activities as insufficiently revolutionary: even though the labor movement was engaged in a great wave of strikes in 1919, including a general strike in Seattle, Washington, the Party's members had no role in them. Instead they urged workers to put aside their short-term economic goals and to concentrate on overthrowing the state. The Profintern, or \\"Red International of Labor Unions,\\" forced the CP to change in 1921, when it directed U.S. communists to work within the AFL in order to make it a revolutionary body ‚Äì what an earlier generation of SP members referred to as \\"boring from within.\\" In order to accomplish this, the Profintern recognized the Trade Union Educational League, an organization founded by William Z. Foster, as its U.S. affiliate. Foster had been, prior to his agreement to bring the TUEL under the wing of the CP, a syndicalist, who believed that workers would seize power through workers' organizations, such as unions, rather than through political organizations, such as a communist party. He had led the AFL's failed 1919 strike in the steel industry and had established particularly close relations then with John Fitzpatrick, the President of the Chicago Federation of Labor. TUEL functioned within existing unions, trying to organize support for industrial unionism, a labor party, organizing the unorganized and the Soviet Union. TUEL strove to create alliances with leaders who shared some of its agenda, while trying to build a base for left unionism at the local level. After some organizational successes, however, TUEL managed to alienate Fitzpatrick, leaving them without major allies when the AFL denounced TUEL as a \\"dual union\\" and expelled TUEL members in 1924. The CPUSA lost more allies when, under orders from the Comintern, it withdrew its previous enthusiastic support for the Progressive Party candidacy of Robert La Follette, Sr. for president in 1924. The CP, on the other hand, had some short-lived successes in the labor movement without the TUEL's help. The CP had broad support in the early 1920s among the radical, largely immigrant, garment workers in New York City. A number of CP members won leadership positions in three major International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) locals in New York City in 1924 and offices in other locals in Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia. They held on to those offices despite the attempts by the Socialist leadership of the ILGWU to oust them. But in 1926 the left leadership in New York forfeited everything they had when they lost a strike of 40,000 cloakmakers. The local union leadership lost the strike in large part because of the internal factionalism within the CP: when the union had the opportunity to settle on terms that were less than what the union had demanded, the union's leaders went to the CP for approval of the deal. But the Party's fraction within the union was reluctant to accept it, afraid that this would open them up to charges of softness in intra-Party factional warfare. The strike dragged on another few months, at which point the locals accepted an inferior agreement. That gave the International union the opportunity it needed: the Socialist leadership of the ILGWU took over the exhausted locals after they settled and their supporters were too dispirited to resist. While the CP retained a strong base of support in the smaller Fur Workers Union, it never recovered from its defeat in the much larger garment industry; on the contrary, the ILGWU, led by David Dubinsky for the next forty years, remained resolutely anti-communist thereafter. The TUEL itself changed for brief period into the dual union that the AFL had accused it of being. The TUEL led a strike of woolen industry workers in Passaic, New Jersey in 1926 ‚Äî until, that is, the Comintern instructed the Party later that year to abandon any independent unions it had formed on the ground that these represented ultra-left adventurism. The strike, which would probably have been lost in any case, ended six months later in defeat after the AFL's United Textile Workers took over leadership of the strike. CPUSA turns left and the Trade Union Unity League The Comintern's repudiation of dual unionism in 1926 turned out, however, to be only a temporary change in policy; in 1928 the CP began establishing new CP-led unions in the coal, textile, food and garment industries and renamed the TUEL the Trade Union Unity League in 1929. This change in policy coincided with Stalin's turn to the left as he moved against his former ally Nikolai Bukharin. CP leaders, such as Foster, willing to make the switch, held on to their positions in the Party, while those who did not, such as Jay Lovestone, were expelled. The CP's Third Period stance towards unions was nearly as ultra-left as its position in 1919 through 1921. While advocating a \\"united front from below,\\" the Party attacked other socialist parties as \\"social fascists\\" and denounced the AFL as \\"an organ to suppress and disorganize the masses\\" which workers should join only to \\"overthrow the reformist bureaucracy\\" that ran them. The CP instead focused on founding new revolutionary unions in the expectation that the collapse of capitalism was just around the corner. These new dual unions were, in fact, often more like ginger groups than unions, with few members and even fewer long-term members. Nonetheless these groups did make some heroic efforts to organize the unorganized. In 1929 the National Textile Workers led a strike of thousands of textile workers in Gastonia, North Carolina, who walked out, despite the NTW's attempts to hold them back, after management fired five union activists. That strike was crushed after mobs of citizens smashed up union offices and murdered a union activist. While local authorities, preachers and newspapers played up the National Textile Workers' association with godless communism and its opposition to white supremacy, it is unlikely that this made much difference in the final analysis. The authorities reacted just as violently when the much less radical AFL intervened after a spontaneous strike of textile workers erupted in other mill towns several months later. That strike likewise ended in mass arrests and the killing of three strikers, shot in the back by sheriffs. =Miners' unions= The CP's efforts in mining were just as unsuccessful. The CP had once had a good deal of support in the internecine struggles within the United Mine Workers in the 1920s, when John L. Lewis used every weapon available to defeat his rivals for union leadership while wages and working conditions in the industry grew worse. The TUEL-supported candidate who ran for UMW President against Lewis in the 1924 election was credited with 66,000 votes in the official tally ‚Äì nearly half what Lewis received. The CP later allied itself, for a time, with John Brophy, whose \\"Save the Union\\" slate probably would have won election to national leadership in 1926 if the vote had been held democratically. Lewis, however, effectively drove all of the TUEL and Brophy supporters from the union after his victory in 1926. The CP later burned its bridges with Brophy, denouncing him as a reformist. The CP founded its own National Miners Union in 1928. It engaged in a fierce struggle to undo wage cuts when miners struck in Pennsylvania and Ohio mines in 1931, but lost the strike when mine operators chose to recognize the UMW ‚Äì which had not been involved in the strike ‚Äì rather than the NMU, then obtained an injunction to prevent the NMU from picketing. The NMU also took on the leadership of a strike that the UMW had called in Harlan County, Kentucky in 1931 with even more disastrous results, since the union was not prepared to provide the relief necessary to permit strikers to remain out for any length of time, particularly in the face of attacks by \\"gun thugs.\\" The NMU's strong opposition to racial discrimination and wholehearted support for the Soviet Union also served to alienate it from the mostly fundamentalist and predominantly white miners in Harlan County. While the strike publicized the horrific conditions in one of the most isolated parts of Appalachia, it did not produce any concrete benefits for striking miners. There were, however, some bright spots for the CP: their Food Workers Industrial Union successfully organized cafeteria and restaurant workers, particularly in New York, where many of the restaurant workers unions had been taken over by Dutch Schultz as part of his labor rackets. Those CP-led unions not only fended off Schultz's gangsters, but thrived, and became dominant within the AFL Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees union in New York when they affiliated with it several years later. The Maritime Workers Industrial Union did not survive the Third Period, but it left its mark. Sailors and longshoremen had a tradition of radical politics and more or less spontaneous job actions; the IWW had been particularly active in both east and west coast ports up through the 1920s. The MWIU organized occasional strikes, attacked the inadequate relief provided for unemployed workers by the YMCA and other groups, and distributed the MWIU's newspapers. These programs attracted a number of sailors and longshoremen, including Harry Bridges, who subsequently led the west coast longshore strike of 1934. The TUUL had similar limited success in the automobile industry, where it established shop nuclei that linked the Party with the campaign for industrial unionism. The CP was, however, more successful in organizing unemployed workers in Detroit and other auto centers than it was in recruiting or organizing auto workers. Early years of the New Deal and founding of the CIO The CP initially looked on the New Deal and the Roosevelt administration as a form of fascism, because the National Industrial Recovery Act provided for a form of corporativist rule, calling on industries to negotiate codes that would regulate prices, production, labor relations and other matters with only indirect government supervision. The government panels created under the NRA generally gave in to employer demands and appeared to be more concerned with preventing strikes than with protecting workers' rights or living standards. Workers flocked to unions for representation, often in advance of any union organizing efforts, in the belief that Roosevelt and the NRA would protect them. Lewis and the UMWA capitalized on this sentiment in 1933 when his organizers told miners that \\"The President wants you to join the Union.\\" While the UMWA organizers may have meant President Lewis, they did not correct the misimpression on the part of many miners who thought they meant President Roosevelt. Workers engaged in a wave of strikes, the most since 1921, in 1934. The largest and most significant were three giant strikes for union recognition among longshoremen on the West Coast, truck drivers in Minneapolis, Minnesota and automobile workers in Toledo, Ohio. In each case the strike became either a general strike or something close to it. In each case radicals, either associated with the CPUSA or other leftwing parties, played key leadership roles; the CP and its allies, such as Harry Bridges, played an important role in the west coast longshore strike. The CP's influence depended, however, on the personal charisma of Harry Bridges and the hard work put in by its members and sympathizers on the docks, rather than on the MWIU itself, which largely disappeared when its radical cadres followed the membership into the newly revived west coast locals of the ILA. While Bridges was apparently never a member of the CP ‚Äî something the government tried to prove, without success, in four different trials over more than a decade ‚Äî he worked closely with Party activists and helped advance their careers within the union, while the union that grew out of the strike, the International Longshoremen and Warehousemen Union, espoused the party's politics for decades. The Party's role in the founding of the Transport Workers Union of America was even clearer: two TUUL organizers, John Santo and Austin Hogan, were instrumental in the founding of the union in 1934, and almost all of its original leaders, including Mike Quill, were either Party members or close followers of Party policies. The TWU won the right to represent New York City's public transit workers after several years of clandestine organizing, a series of small strikes, a sitdown strike in the BMT's Kent Avenue powerhouse in 1937 and an overwhelming victory among IRT employees in an NLRB election several months later. Yet while the CP played a leading role in that organization, Party members, even those whose party membership had been open in the past, chose to downplay or conceal their membership. Hogan, a CP candidate for Congress in 1934, kept his party affiliation private, to the extent that was possible, after he became President of TWU Local 100, the local of New York City subway workers. The party discontinued its shop papers, which went by names such as \\"Red Dynamo\\" and \\"Red Express\\", in 1935, when TWU organizers claimed that the party's overt role in the union was interfering with their efforts and when Popular Front alliance-building replaced Third Period separatism. While the party remained influential ‚Äî some said dominant ‚Äî in the union until 1949, and the union closely followed party policies on issues such as civil rights, public ownership of the subways and fare increases, the party took no credit for its contributions and party members vigorously rejected claims of employers, intra-union opponents and investigators that the party was, in fact, a major influence in the union. =CIO= The CP similarly gained influence at first in the newly formed Congress of Industrial Organizations, or CIO, on the strength of individual members' work. Lee Pressman, the General Counsel for the CIO and later the United Steelworkers of America, was a member of the CP and the underground Ware group involved in espionage for the Soviet Union. The first publicity director for the CIO, Len De Caux, was likewise a member of the CP throughout his years with the CIO as were many more organizers and rank-and-file activists within the unions affiliated with the CIO. Individuals like Pressman and De Caux would not have considered working for the CIO if the CP had not shifted its position from sectarian purity to first a united front and later a popular front policy that favored alliances with other \\"progressive forces.\\" At the same time the New Deal was turning to the left, in response to both the increasingly hostile response by employers and the wave of worker discontent that had replaced the apathetic resignation of the first years of the Great Depression. The CP, having denounced Roosevelt as a fascist only a few years earlier, moved closer and closer to embracing him. At the same time the CIO and other progressive organizations and individuals overcome many of their reservations about working with the CP. Of the two hundred or so organizers that Lewis hired for the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, sixty were CP members, with particular strength among the staff responsible for organizing foreign-born and African-American workers and in the Chicago area. Lewis was not particularly concerned with the political beliefs of his organizers, so long as he controlled the organization. As he once famously remarked, \\"I do not turn my organizers or CIO members upside down and shake them to see what kind of literature falls out of their pockets.\\" He took the same line in private, when David Dubinsky of the ILGWU asked him about the communists on the SWOC staff; as he told Dubinsky, \\"Who gets the bird? The hunter or the dog?\\" Organizing basic industry The CP did not gain influence solely through seeking staff positions, however. In the rubber workers' strike in Akron, Ohio that represented the first test of the CIO's ability to turn mass discontent into union gains, a number of rank-and- file leaders were also CP members. The Party had a degree of presence, both at the local and international level, in the United Rubber Workers union formed after the strike. The CP also exerted a great deal of influence within the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (or UE), founded in 1936 by the merger of a number of federal unions created by the AFL and small shop caucuses, largely made up of CP activists and other socialists and radicals, at General Electric, Westinghouse Electric Company and other unorganized companies. The CP grew even more powerful within the UE in 1937 when James J. Matles, former head of the CP's Metal Workers Industrial Union, brought in a number of locals after a brief affiliation with the International Association of Machinists. Matles and other CP members and allies held the bulk of the important positions within the UE for the next twelve years, until the CIO engineered a split within it in order to separate the Communist leaders from the CIO; they continued to hold power thereafter within that portion of the union that was not raided by the International Union of Electrical Workers. =United Auto Workers= The CP achieved even greater results, but less long-term success, working within the United Automobile Workers. Like the UE, the UAW was also formed in 1936 out of a number of federal unions created by the AFL and locals from other unions in the industry. Of its 25,000 workers, almost all came from outside Michigan. One of the most prominent UAW activists in the early years of the union was Wyndham Mortimer, who had led a strike against White Motors in Cleveland, Ohio. Mortimer was elected vice-president at the UAW's first convention and might have been elected president if not for concern about his Party membership. Mortimer and the CP formed alliances at that first convention with George Addes, then the secretary-treasurer of the UAW, later its president, and Walter Reuther, who headed the UAW from 1947 until his death in 1970. The CP maintained its alliance with Addes, the center of the left-wing caucus within the UAW, for the next decade. Its alliance with Reuther proved much shorter. When the UAW decided to organize the industry by going after General Motors, Mortimer was sent to Flint, Michigan, where GM's production was centered. Even at that early stage factional infighting within the UAW, in particular between Mortimer and Homer Martin, the first President of the UAW, threatened to derail the campaign. When Martin pulled Mortimer out of Flint, Mortimer arranged for Bob Travis, another union activist and CP member from Toledo, to replace him. Travis played an active role in the Flint Sit-Down Strike, aided by some veteran CP autoworkers inside Fisher Body Plant #1 ‚Äì but also by other radical workers, some belonging to Trotskyist parties, the Socialist Party or the IWW. The same pattern applied outside the plants: Socialist Party members, such as Walter Reuther's brothers Victor Reuther and Roy Reuther, and the Socialists and ex-Socialists working for the CIO cooperated with CP members, such as Henry Kraus, the UAW's publicity director, with a minimum of sectarian bickering. The CP, in fact, played down its revolutionary politics during the sit-down strike. In part this was to avoid giving GM and its allies an issue to use against the strike; in part it was out of fear of distancing the Party from the strikers, who were, in the opinion of CP leadership, using revolutionary means to achieve traditional union goals. The Socialists, by contrast, had a much smaller base within the striking workers, but were much more inclined to attach revolutionary significance to the sit-down strikes and to magnify their own role in them. =Steelworkers= The CP was even more circumspect in the Steel Workers Organizing Committee. The CP was anxious not to scare off its partners and employers in the CIO: its members therefore made no effort to advertise their Party affiliation and even took steps not to pack SWOC conventions. Nor did circumstances give them much opportunity to rise to leadership. Unlike the UAW, which was born out of tumultuous struggles in which CP activists and other radicals played leading parts, the SWOC conducted a much more top-down organizing campaign subject to close control. SWOC organizers who belonged to the CP played an important role in recruiting and organizing members, but rarely stayed in one area long enough to cultivate the sort of relations with local leaders that might have allowed them to recruit them into the Party, if they had tried to do so. They simply did not have the freedom of action that Mortimer, Travis and others within the UAW did. Nor did they have the same power. As staff members, Pressman, de Caux and the SWOC organizers who belonged to the CP had, at most, only indirect influence on CIO or SWOC policy and no independent base to rally support or propagandize for other issues. Philip Murray, a former UMWA associate whom Lewis installed as head of the SWOC, weeded out most of the Communists from the union over the years after the initial organizing drives as the SWOC became the United Steelworkers of America. By 1942 the purge was almost complete.

Robot is a fictional character from the American science fiction comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K). Crow is a robot, who, along with others, ridicules poor-quality B movie to Z movies.  Overview  According to the MST3K storyline, Crow ‚Äî like his fellow robots Tom Servo, Gypsy, and Cambot ‚Äî was built by Joel Robinson (Joel Hodgson), who created them to help him withstand the torment of watching bad movies on the Satellite of Love. On the Satellite, Crow was forced with the rest of the crew to watch horrible retro movies sent by mad scientist Dr. Clayton Forrester and his assistants. In episode 814, \\"Riding with Death\\", Crow describes himself as being made from molybdenum, and episode 908 Mike piles rocks atop Crow and comments on his \\"durable molybdenum frame\\". Crow's middle initial stands for \\"The\\". In episode #K19: Hangar 18, Joel stated that \\"Crow\\" was an acronym for \\"Cybernetic Remotely Operated Woman\\", giving Crow a brief identity crisis until Joel revealed he built Crow specifically to play this joke on him. Crow is also sometimes called \\"Art\\", but it is primarily by late-series antagonist Pearl Forrester. This arose from a gag in episode 203 Jungle Goddess following a skit centered on the sitcom The Honeymooners, where Joel referred to Crow as \\"Art Crow\\" (in reference to Honeymooners co-star Art Carney). After Best Brains received a letter from a child who had evidently missed the cultural reference and labeled a drawing of Crow as \\"Art\\" (episode 402, The Giant Gila Monster), the show's writers turned the name into a recurring joke. Crow was voiced by Trace Beaulieu from the beginning of the series through the end of season seven, and Bill Corbett from the eighth season until the tenth season. Corbett's Crow was noticeably more cynical, irritable, and impatient when viewing the bad movies than Beaulieu's Crow had been. Corbett's Crow also occasionally appeared more unhinged than Beaulieu's incarnation. For example, in episode #902 The Phantom Planet Crow dresses as a Solarite (a monster from the movie played by Richard Kiel) and explains: \\"Have you guys ever noticed how I'll see a movie, snap, lose control of myself, and then decide I'm one of the characters in the movie, and then go out and dress myself up that way?\\" (Crow having done this before in episode #820 Space Mutiny as a \\"Bellerian\\"). He is voiced by Hampton Yount in the 2017 series revival. Crow's accomplishments during the show's run include: * Writing several screenplays, including Earth vs. Soup (his seminal work) (seen in Earth vs the Spider), Peter Graves at the University of Minnesota (Beginning of the End), The Spy Who Hugged Me (Secret Agent Super Dragon), Chocolate Jones and the Temple of Funk (Angels Revenge), and Crow T. Robot's World War Space (Starcrash). He also wrote a rather poorly researched documentary titled Crow T. Robot's Bram Stoker's The Civil War, and created another called Let's Talk Women!, in which he denies the existence of women. He also wrote a one man show titled \\"Robot on the Run\\". In the revival series, Crow creates a sitcom with Tom called Mad Bots, and later he creates a parody Space Opera title Crow T. Robot's World War Space. * Being an avid member of the Kim Cattrall and Estelle Winwood fan clubs. * Co-writing a satirical musical called Supercalifragilisticexpiali- wacky! * During the Christmas episode #321, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, he wrote a Christmas carol titled \\"Let's Have a Patrick Swayze Christmas\\", inspired by his favorite movie, Road House. * Though everyone aboard the SOL would like to escape, the cause is almost always the desire for freedom, not a result of the slew of terrible B-movies. But, in episode #903, The Pumaman, Crow actually succumbed to the Mads' experiment. He decided this film had finally pushed him over the edge and that he could no longer stand watching the movies. He attempted to run away, hoping to find a satellite where he would be forced to watch good movies, but gave up on his escape attempt after mere seconds. * In between segments of the movie Werewolf, he unintentionally turns Mike into a \\"Werecrow.\\" In the earlier seasons of the show, he often announced \\"Ladies and gentlemen, Topo Gigio!\\" in the voice of Ed Sullivan. During episode 416, Fire Maidens of Outer Space, Crow acquired a double named \\"Timmy\\", to whom the trio quickly took a liking. (Timmy was actually portrayed by the black-painted Crow used for the Shadowrama in the theater.) However, the double began playing tricks on Tom Servo and Joel, who blamed Crow for the actions. He eventually joined them in the theater during the movie and attacked Tom, cocooning him in a material identical to the xenomorph in Alien, forcing Joel (who referenced Aliens by growling, \\"Let go of him, you bitch!\\") and Crow to stuff him into an airlock and blast him out of the ship and into space. Timmy's appearance was a parody of the evil twin concept. Crow holds the distinction of being the only SOL robot to ever visit Deep 13 (although Tom Servo and Gypsy once visited the alternate-earth version and Cambot is directly connected to the Mads' camera): In episode 615, Kitten with a Whip, he slid down the Umbilicus in an attempt to bring the SOL back to Earth, only to be frightened back up by Dr. Forrester (who then had Frank put a giant mousetrap beneath the Umbilicus). In the \\"Turkey Day\\" version of episode 701, Night of the Blood Beast, Crow attended the Forrester Thanksgiving dinner alongside such guests as Mr. B Natural, Pitch the Devil, and others. During this episode, Crow seems to have a friendship with Pearl Forrester, who seems to enjoy his company and the fact he would listen to her complain about her inept son, Dr. Forrester. In the theatrical film based on the series, Crow distinguishes himself early on by attempting to tunnel back to Earth using a pickaxe. Even he admits the faulty logic employed in this scheme when he examines his calculations: \\"Well, look at that! 'Breach hull, all die' ‚Äî I even had it underlined!\\" / \\"Well, believe me, Mike, I calculated the odds of this succeeding versus the odds I was doing something incredibly stupid, and...I went ahead anyway.\\" A running joke of Crow's character throughout the series, particularly in the last few seasons of the Sci-Fi channel's running of the show, is his frequent costume changes into film characters during the host segments. Often Crow has been known to take on the appearance and sometimes the personality of one of the characters in the movie that is currently being shown, usually ending with Mike, Tom Servo, or Joel using Crow's role-playing as a plot device or setup to a joke that mocks the film even more. As previously mentioned, this continuing effect finally was recognized by Crow himself during Episode 902, The Phantom Planet. Another recurring joke that was more prominent during the earlier seasons of the series ‚Äì dating, in fact, from the KTMA days ‚Äì was Crow's apparent inability to distinguish between different types of animal; he would joyfully cry \\"Kitty!\\" when an animal appeared on screen, regardless of whether it was at all feline, and regardless of whether it was even cute enough to elicit such a positive response. In Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Comic, Crow along with the other Bots and Jonah Heston were sent into the comics thanks to Kinga's new invention the Bubbulat-R. While Tom Servo was sent into Johnny Jason, Teen Reporter and Jonah was sent into Black Cat, Crow was sent into Horrific but then the effects of the comic started to make Crow succumb a comic disease called four-color fever and turns into a monster called \\"the Crow-Keeper\\" which eventually starts to threaten his relationship with Jonah and the other Bots and Kinga's plan in conquering comic media.  Behind the scenes  Crow is a gold-colored puppet composed of, among other things, a soap dish eye cowl, ping pong ball eyes, a split plastic bowling pin mouth, a lacrosse face mask webbing (Cooper XL7-FG), and Tupperware panels for the body. The original puppet for Crow was built by Joel Hodgson in a single night before filming the pilot episode. At the beginning of Season One, the puppet was redesigned and built by Trace Beaulieu, adding a second Tupperware tray to Crow's torso as well as movable eyes. Another version of Crow is used for the theater segments. This version is painted flat black. Of all the bots, Crow was the least changed from his KTMA incarnation to when the series became nationally broadcast. He is the only one who retained his general primary color. Trace Beaulieu operated Crow in the initial KTMA season and throughout the Comedy Channel/Comedy Central years of seasons 1‚Äì7, as well as in Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie. During KTMA and season 1, Trace slowly refined Crow's voice. Originally, it was somewhat babyish, with a pronounced Minnesota accent. By season two, Crow's voice had become more sharp. Upon Trace's departure, Brooklyn-raised Bill Corbett took over Crow's operation. Corbett jokingly mentioned that during his time alone on the SOL Crow suffered a stroke, thus explaining the change of his voice and his initially less-than- graceful handling of the puppet. Despite initial concerns from the fanbase regarding Beaulieu's departure, the reception for Corbett's performance was very positive and he quickly became a fan favorite. The show's writers later made a joke of the change in episode 904, Werewolf, by suggesting that Crow's inherent characteristics included a change of voice every seven years. When Joel Hodgson returned for a guest spot in episode 1001, Soultaker, he offhandedly suggests that Crow \\"changed his bowling pin\\" (that is, his mouth). From Season 8 onward, in the opening theme during the \\"Robot Roll Call\\", Crow can be heard exclaiming \\"I'm different!\\" Many first-time viewers of the series are confused by Crow's appearance during the movie segments. Only the outline of his head can be seen, and (due to multistable perception) it can appear as if Crow is facing toward the viewer. This phenomenon was addressed in The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide with illustrations comparing Crow to a Necker cube. At Dragon Con in 2009, Beaulieu and Corbett made a joint appearance for a \\"Crow vs. Crow\\" panel discussion, in which they discussed their respective work with the character. The discussion is included as a bonus feature on the Mystery Science Theater 3000: Vol. XX DVD set from Shout! Factory. For the series revival, a new Crow was built with much larger hands, controlled with arm rods, similar to Kermit the Frog, which makes the puppeteering more complicated, so two puppeteers are dedicated to Crow, with Yount controlling the opening and closing of Crow's beak and providing the voice off-camera.  Appearances in other media  * An episode of Futurama entitled \\"Raging Bender\\" has the gang visiting the theater, where Fry mockingly riffs on a newsreel intro before being shushed by the silhouette of a rather testy Crow-like robot ironically saying \\"Don't talk during the movie!\\"; beside him is a Tom Servo-resembling robot.Futurama, episode \\"Raging Bender\\" [2.21], 27 February 2000 * In the Archie Comics series Sonic the Hedgehog, issue #52, Sonic is sent into a 1920s variation of Mobius. In searching for the handheld computer Nicole, Sonic does battle with a number of robots, three of them resembling Crow T. Robot, Tom Servo and Cambot. * In an issue of Star Wars Tales, Crow and Tom (with his cylinder head) are seen in the foreground of a comedic tale written by Peter David, starring a perky Force-using droid. He also appears in Tag and Bink: Revenge of the Clone Menace, along with Tom Servo and Gypsy. * The June 8 2007 edition of the Cat And Girl comic features Crow as the President of South Vietnam. *Trace Beaulieu reprised his role of Crow for a brief cameo appearance in two episodes of the fourth season of Arrested Development, along with Joel.MST3K Pops Up in Arrested Development  Crow Syndrome  The \\"Crow Syndrome\\" is a frequent joke on the show and MSTings, wherein Crow chimes in with an off- topic and/or excessively lewd comment and the other two reprimand him, often bemusedly and perturbedly shouting \\"Crow!\\" in response. \\"Crow Syndrome\\" is a general term, and is used in MSTings that do not feature Crow or other regular characters.Web Site Number 9 MSTing FAQ, question 3.4  Further reading  * MST3K FAQ: What is this MST3K Thing, Anyway? * MST3K FAQ: \\"This is my Bot!

The 2011 census found a population of 28,586. making it the third largest town in Cumbria after Carlisle and Barrow-in-Furness.

Kendal is listed in the Domesday Book as part of Yorkshire with the name Cherchebi (from Old Norse kirkju-b√Ω, \\"church-village\\"). For many centuries it was called Kirkby Kendal: \\"village with a church in the valley of the River Kent\\".A. D. Mills, Dictionary of English Place Names, Oxford: OUP, 1998.The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society, ed. by Victor Watts, Cambridge: CUP, 2004), under River KENT and KENDAL. History A chartered market town, the centre of Kendal has formed round a high street with fortified alleyways, known locally as yards, off to either side, which allowed local people to shelter from the Anglo-Scottish raiders known as Border Reivers. The main industry in those times was the manufacture of woollen goods, whose importance is reflected in the town's coat of arms and in its Latin motto Pannus mihi panis (Cloth is my bread.) \\"Kendal Green\\" was a hard-wearing, wool-based fabric specific to the local manufacturing process. It was supposedly sported by the Kendalian archers instrumental in the English victory over the French at the Battle of Agincourt. Kendal Green was also worn by slaves in the Americas and appears in songs and literature from that time. Shakespeare notes it as the colour of clothing worn by foresters (Henry IV, Part 1). Kendal Castle has a long history as a stronghold, built on the site of several successive castles. The earliest was a Norman motte and bailey (now located on the west side of the town), when the settlement went under the name of Kirkbie Strickland. The most recent is from the late 12th century, as the castle of the Barony of Kendal, the part of Westmorland ruled from here. The castle is best known as the home of the Parr family, as heirs of these barons. They inherited it through marriage in the reign of Edward III of England. Rumours still circulate that King Henry VIII's sixth wife Catherine Parr was born at Kendal Castle, but the evidence available leaves this unlikely: by her time the castle was beyond repair and her father was already based in Blackfriars, London, at the court of King Henry VIII.Linda Porter. Katherine, the Queen, MacMillan, 2010. p. 21. The site of the Roman fort at Watercrook across the River Kent =Roman fort= A Roman fort stood about 2 miles south of today's town centre, at a site later known as Watercrook. It was built about AD 90, originally in timber, rebuilt with stone about 130, in the reign of Hadrian. The fort was abandoned for about 20 years during the Antonine re-occupation of Scotland. It was rebuilt in the reign of Marcus Aurelius and occupied until about 270 ‚Äì probably the last time it served military purposes. What remains of the stone structure is now buried under a field. Many Roman artefacts from the site may be found in the Kendal Museum. The Roman site was built on a pre-existing Iron Age fort. =Transport= Early travellers to Kendal complained of eight miles of \\"nothing but a confused mixture of Rockes and Boggs.\\"Being a Relation of a Short Survey of 26 Counties, briefly describing the Citties and their Scytuations, and the Corporate Towns and Castles Herein.

Riding horseback was the fastest form of travel, as the road was \\"no better than the roughest fell tracks on high ground and spongy, miry tracks in the vallies.\\" It became clear it was unjust and beyond the power of a thinly scattered rural population to maintain a road used for through traffic. \\"Whereas the road is very ruinous, and some parts thereof almost impassable and could not, by the ordinary course appointed by the Laws then in being for repairing the highways, be amended and kept in good repair, unless some further provision was made.\\" In 1703, by Order of the Quarter Sessions of the Barony of Kendall, the surveyors of highways were to make the roads good and sufficient for the passage of coaches, carts and carriages. In 1753 the Keighley and Kendal Turnpike brought a stage coach service from Yorkshire as far as Kendal.Introduction To The Main Roads of Kendale British History. Accessed 30 September 2012. =Mint cake= Kendal mint cake Kendal is known for Kendal mint cake, a glucose-based confectionery reputedly discovered accidentally by Joseph Wiper during a search for a clear glacier mint. Used on numerous expeditions to mountaintops (including Mount Everest and K2) and both poles of the Earth, its popularity is mainly due to the very astute decision of the original manufacturer's great-nephew to market it as an energy food and supply it to Ernest Shackleton's 1914‚Äì1917 Trans- Antarctic Expedition. By the time the business was sold to a competitor, Romney's, in 1987 there were several rival mint-cake producers, some still in business. =Tobacco and snuff= Snuff manufacture in Kendal dates from 1792, when Kendalian Thomas Harrison returned from learning its production in Glasgow, Scotland. He brought with him 50 tons of second-hand equipment, all carried on horseback. Pipe tobacco and other tobacco products were added later to the firm's production. Ownership of the firm passed to a son-in-law, Samuel Gawith, whose eponymic firm Samuel Gawith & Co. remains in business. After Gawith's death in 1865, the firm passed to his two eldest sons, being administered initially by trustees, including Henry Hoggarth, and John Thomas Illingworth. Illingworth left the firm in 1867 to start his own firm, which remained in business until the 1980s. The youngest son of Samuel Gawith subsequently teamed with Henry Hoggarth to form Gawith Hoggarth TT, Ltd. Both firms continue in business in Kendal, producing snuffs and tobacco products used around the world. Samuel Gawith and Company holds the distinction of employing the oldest piece of industrial equipment still in use in the world: a device manufactured in the 1750s. Governance =Civic history= The municipal borough of Kendal was created in 1835; until 1894 it was also an urban sanitary district. The borough boundaries were altered in 1935 under a County Review Order to include a patch of South Westmorland Rural District. The civil parishes of Kirkland and Nether Graveship became in 1908 part of Kendal Civil Parish, whose boundaries thereafter were the same as the borough's. From 1888 to 1974, Kendal was the centre of the administrative county of Westmorland, although Appleby was the traditional county town. The borough was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the South Lakeland district of Cumbria. Kendal as a successor parish kept its own town council. =Parliament= Kendal is part of the Westmorland and Lonsdale parliamentary constituency, of which Tim Farron is the current MP, representing the Liberal Democrats. Geography Kendal stands on the River Kent, surrounded by low hills and near the Lake District National Park formed in 1951, but not in it. which was laid out to exclude the town. Kendal's rural location makes it an important commercial centre for a wide area. It has been dubbed \\"The Gateway to The Lakes\\". =Climate= Kendal has a marine west-coast climate, category Cfb on the K√∂ppen Climate Classification. It has moderately warm summers and mild winters with precipitation at all times of year. In July and August the average daily maximum and minimum are respectively. The corresponding ones in January and February are . Economy Kendal's early prosperity was based largely on cloth manufacture. In the 19th century it became a centre for the manufacture of snuff and shoes ‚Äì the K Shoes company remained a major employer in the town until its factory closed in 2003. There are still several industries based in the town, such as Gilbert Gilkes & Gordon (manufacturers of pumps and turbines), James Cropper paper makers (based in Burneside, who make, at no profit, the paper for the Remembrance poppies for The Royal British Legion), Mardix (switchgear), Lakeland, and Kendal Nutricare, which has a facility for making baby milk in the north of the town. Tourism is now a major employer, but there is also a significant IT and design sector, enabled by increased broadband availability. On 26 February 2003 Kendal was granted Fairtrade Town status. Transport Kendal railway station A bridge over the old course of the Lancaster Canal, now used as a footpath Kendal railway station lies on the Windermere Branch Line, with connections to Windermere to the north, and to Oxenholme Lake District station (on the West Coast Main Line) and Lancaster railway station to the south. Kendal is about from the M6 motorway. It is bypassed on the west side by the A591 road, linking it to Windermere and Keswick, and by the A590 leading to Barrow. It is also the end point of the A65 road to Kirkby Lonsdale, Skipton and Yorkshire, and a destination on the A6 road to Penrith. Kendal is signposted off the M6 at Junctions 36 (A65, A590), 37 (A684 road), 38 (A685 road) and 39 (A6). A three-mile, ¬£1.9m A591 bypass opened on 29 August 1971. The Lancaster Canal was built as far as Kendal in 1819, but the northern section was rendered unnavigable by the construction of the M6. Part of this section was drained and filled in to prevent leakage, and the course of the canal through Kendal has now been built over. The canal towpath, however, remains as a footpath through Kendal. A campaign is underway to restore the canal as far as Kendal. Kendal has a daily coach service to London. Local buses from the bus station serve destinations such as Ambleside, Barrow-in-Furness and Lancaster, with long-distance National Express coaches to Preston and Birmingham. Education The Queen Katherine School, on Appleby Road, is a secondary school with academy status. The school also has a sixth form. Kirkbie Kendal School, formerly Kendal Grammar School, is a secondary school Business and Enterprise College serving the area. It operates as a foundation school with academy status. Its former pupils include the historian David Starkey and the clinical psychologist Vanessa Jones. Kendal College for further and higher education and the training of employers has been judged outstanding by Ofsted. It has over 4,000 students and employs over 150 staff. The numerous primary schools in the area include Castle Park, Stramongate School, Heron Hill, Ghyllside, Vicarage Park, St Thomas's and Dean Gibson. The nearby village of Natland has St Mark's School. Sport Kendal Town Football Club plays in the North West Division one, with home games at Parkside Road Stadium.

It was located 24 kilometers north of Gaza, between Ashkelon and Ashdod.  History  Remains from the fifth and sixth century CE have been found here, together with Byzantine ceramics.Dauphin, 1998, p. 869 Hamama is identified as the fifth century CE Byzantine town of Peleia. Peleia translates as \\"dove\\", and when the Arabs conquered it through the Rashidun Caliphate in the seventh century, the town received its Arabic name Hamama meaning \\"dove\\", reflecting its Byzantine roots.Khalidi, 1992, pp. 97-98 Hamama was located near the site of a battle in 1099 between the Crusaders and the Fatimids, resulting in a Crusader victory. Later Hamama passed into Muslim Mamluk hands, and by 1333/4 CE (734 H.) some of the income from the village formed part of a waqf of the tomb (turba) and madrasa of Aqbugha b. Abd Allah in Cairo.MPF, 10 No. 30. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 146 In 1432, it is reported that the Mamluk sultan Barsbay passed through the village. In this period, a renowned scholar and preacher at the al-Aqsa Mosque, Ahmad al-Shafi'i (1406‚Äì1465), was born there. =Ottoman era= Hamama, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the tax registers of 1596 it appeared as being in the a village in the nahiya of Gaza (Gaza Sanjak), with a population of 84 Muslim households, an estimated 462 persons. The villagers paid taxes on goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 6,800 ak√ße. All of the revenue went to a waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 142. Cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 98. The seventeenth-century traveller al-Nabulsi recorded that the tomb (qabr) of Shaykh Ibrahim Abi Arqub was located in the village, while the Syrian Sufi teacher and traveller Mustafa al-Bakri al- Siddiqi (1688-1748/9) visited Hamama in the first half of the eighteenth century, after leaving al-Jura.Khalidi, 1992, p. 98.

Jacotin's Map of Palestine. D.H.Kellner. p. 161. In 1838, Hamameh was noted as a Muslim village in the Gaza district.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 118 In 1863, the French explorer Victor Gu√©rin visited the village, and noted a mosque constructed with ancient materials.Gu√©rin, 1869, pp. 129 -130 An official Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Hamame had 193 houses and a population of 635, although it only counted the men.Socin, 1879, p. 154Hartmann, 1883, p. 131, noted 291 houses =British Mandate era= Under the British Mandate in Palestine, a village council was established to administer local affairs, and Hamama had a mosque, and two primary schools for boys and girls established in 1921.Khalidi, 1992, p. 99 In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Hamama had a population of 2,731; 2,722 Muslims and 9 Christians,Barron, 1923, Table V, Sub-district of Gaza, p. 8 where all the Christians were Orthodox.Barron, 1923, Table XIII, p. 44 The population had increased in the 1931 census to 3,405; 3,401 Muslims and 4 Christians, in a total of 865 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 3 Hamada 1930 1:20,000 Hamada 1945 1:250,000 (lower left) In the 1945 statistics Hamama had a population of 5,070; 5,000 Muslims, 10 Christians and 60 Jews, with a total of 41,366 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 136 In 1946, the boys' school had an enrollment of 338, and the girls' school an enrollment of 46. Its inhabitants engaged primarily in fishing and agriculture, cultivating grain, citrus, apricots, almonds, figs, olives, watermelons, and cantaloupes. Due to the existence of sand dunes in the north part of the town, trees were planted on parts of those lands to prevent soil erosion. During the Mandate time, the village was visited by inspectors from the Department of Antiquities who noted two mosques. One of these, known as Shaykh Ibrahim Abi Arqub, included marble columns and capitals in the iwan. The other mosque, known as Shaykh Hamid, also incorporated marble fragments. Neither of these mosques have survived.Petersen, 2001, p. 146 = 1948, and aftermath = According to reports published by the newspaper Felesteen, Hamama was first drawn into the 1948 Arab-Israeli War after a group of workers from the town laboring in the adjacent fields were struck by Jewish residents from Nitzanim on January 22, 1948, leaving fifteen Arabs wounded. Two days later, a unit from Nitzanim opened fire on Hamama residents, killing one, and on February 17, a group of workers waiting for a bus on the road between Isdud and the town were fired upon, wounding two. It was captured by Israel from the Egyptian Army in the first stage of Operation Yoav on October 28. By then several refugees from nearby towns were in Hamama, most of them, along with many of Hamama's residents, fled with the withdrawing Egyptian troops.Morris, 1987, p.220, quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.99. At the end of November 1948, Coastal Plain District troops carried out sweeps of the villages around and to the south of Majdal.

The CP has had only negligible influence in labor since its supporters' defeat in internal union political battles in the aftermath of World War II and the CIO's (CIO) expulsion of unions in which the party held the most influence in 1950. Historians disagree why the American union movement never formed a major labor party, and why American workers have never embraced socialist parties in the same numbers as major ones. Some have argued that a strain of American exceptionalism made U.S. workers resistant to parties that emphasized class struggle; others have contended that downplaying political and social agendas for the sake of unity, short-term gains and building strong unions was at the cost of a potential labor party. Others contend instead that the left lost its power to lead the labor movement by what commenters charged were 'ideological zig-zags'. The CP's history within the labor movement support parts of all of these theses. Factionalism, zig zags and retreats After playing a leading role in the United Automobile Workers's (UAW) victories in Flint against General Motors Corporation and against Chrysler Corporation in 1937, the CP found itself under sharp attack from its opponents within the UAW. Homer Martin, first president of the UAW, sought to drive out all of the left activists within the UAW in order to eliminate any rival contenders for power. Martin brought in Jay Lovestone, former executive secretary of the CP before his expulsion in 1929, as his advisor and installed Lovestone supporters in key positions throughout the union. Martin only succeeded, however, in bringing about his own downfall. After he failed to persuade the UAW Convention in 1937 to give him authority to fire organizers and eliminate local union newspapers, Martin set out to expel his rivals. After firing or transferring a number of CP members who had played prominent roles in the Flint sit-down strike, Martin first suspended, then expelled, Mortimer and his other opponents on the UAW's Executive Board. The CIO leadership, alarmed by the possibility that sectarian infighting might destroy the UAW, forced Martin to reinstate the Executive Board members. When the reconstituted Executive Board ordered Martin to sever his ties with Lovestone and to submit all his public announcements to it for its approval, he attempted to suspend the majority of the Board, including both his opponents associated with the CP, such as Mortimer, their allies, such as Richard Frankensteen, and the UAW leaders associated with the Socialist Party, such as Walter Reuther. That nearly split the UAW. After skirmishes at the UAW headquarters and some local unions, the expelled Executive Board members, with the support of the CIO, regained control in 1939 and expelled Martin. He left with about 20,000 members to form his own union, which affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Lovestone left with him. The CP was in a particularly strong position at that point: it was the leading player in the Left-Center coalition that had defeated Martin and would have been able to elect George Addes, a close ally of the Party, as President of the UAW if it had pressed the point. But that would have required that the Party defy Sidney Hillman, head of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and the most powerful force within the CIO after Lewis, and Philip Murray, Lewis' prot√©g√© and head of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, who came to the convention to demand the selection of R.J. Thomas, an apolitical Board member who had, until recently, supported Martin, as its candidate to end the factional fighting within the UAW. According to some reports, when Hillman and Murray could not bring Mortimer and his supporters around, Earl Browder, Chairman of the Communist Party of the USA (CPUSA), came to Cleveland to demand that they support Thomas. Eager not to appear as sectarians and thus endanger their role within the CIO at large, the CP leadership had the Communists within the UAW support Thomas and also permit the elimination of the Vice-President positions that they had held. At the same time, the CP began dissolving its factions within the UAW and dropping its shop papers as it aligned itself even more closely with the New Deal. In the name of labor unity, the CP undertook a tactical retreat. The CP's conciliatory stance did not, however, protect it from its other factional rivals within the UAW. The working alliance between the CP and the Socialists in the UAW had broken down in 1938 over differences over the CP's support for \\"collective security,\\" an alliance of the Soviet Union with the non-fascist nations of the West against Hitler. The Socialist Party, at that time even further left than the CP on many issues, organized a separate caucus within the Executive Board that, from that point forward, opposed the CP and its alliance partners. =Break with the Roosevelt administration= The CP made it easier for its opponents by making a number of sudden and shocking changes in policy. After the Hitler-Stalin pact, the CP campaigned vigorously against any U.S. involvement in the war against fascism; a journalist with the CP's Weekly Worker newspaper coined the slogan \\"The Yanks Ain't Coming\\" to sum up the Party's position. What is more, the CP now repudiated its Popular Front strategies of the previous four years, attacking President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's administration's efforts to support France and Britain against Germany as a campaign to lead the U.S. into an imperialist war. The federal government responded by arresting Earl Browder and a number of other CP leaders. The CP's opponents within the labor movement capitalized on the Party's break with FDR to attack it. James Carey, the president of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (or UE) who had worked closely with Communist UE officials in the past, now distanced himself from them over their opposition to a third term for Roosevelt. The UAW passed several resolutions condemning both Nazis and Communists at its Conventions. At the same time that their break with Roosevelt isolated them within the CIO, opponents of the CP outside the labor movement stepped up their attacks on the loyalty of Party members, accusing them, among other things, of engaging in sabotage by supporting strikes of aircraft workers during the UAW's organizing drive in that industry. While some of these accusations, such as those made by the Dies Committee or Reader's Digest, were so wide of the mark as to discredit the accusers, the tide of unfavorable publicity made any association with the CP that much riskier. The CP also lost ground within the CIO. While the CP believed it could shelter itself within the CIO by continuing to loyally support Lewis, who also opposed a third term for Roosevelt, that reliance on Lewis was misplaced. Lewis was prepared both to use the CP and to get rid of CP members when they no longer served his purposes, as demonstrated by the activities of his lieutenant, Adolph Germer, who actively undercut the CP leadership within the International Woodworkers of America when sent to assist it in organizing lumber workers in the Northwest in 1940. At the same time Lewis abolished the position of west coast director of the CIO, which Harry Bridges had held, limiting his authority to California. Whatever protection the CP could have hoped to receive from Lewis evaporated in any event in 1940, when Lewis abruptly resigned from his position as President of the CIO following his baffling decision to support Wendell Willkie over Roosevelt for President that year. Philip Murray, Lewis' successor as head of the CIO, was determined to stop the spread of the CP's influence in the CIO and to demonstrate to the public at large that the CIO was not controlled by the CP. To that end he insisted on a resolution at the CIO's 1940 conference that condemned Communism, along with Nazism and fascism, as \\"inimical to the welfare of labor.\\" Lee Pressman, the most highly placed CP ally within the CIO, presented the resolution in his role as secretary of the resolutions committee. Murray did not, however, insist on banning Communists from the CIO; on the contrary, he had no desire to provoke a public fight over the CP's politics or CP members' role within either the CIO or its affiliates. This suited the Party, which likewise did not want to risk a showdown that could possibly result in either their expulsion or split the CIO. So while internal political disputes kept the battles raging within unions such as the UAW, the UE and the IWA, the CP agreed to a compromise that forced them to accept the label of \\"totalitarian,\\" but allowed them to maintain their positions within the CIO itself. Communist influence in labor unions was seen by the Roosevelt administration as a serious threat to US military preparedness. As the US military built up in 1940 and 1941, US Secretary of War Henry Stimson was convinced that labor strikes and slowdowns at key facilities were due to the CPUSA's efforts to block Franklin Roosevelt's military preparedness policy. Strikes at Harville Die-Casting Company, Alcoa, and North American Aviation were widely seen within the Roosevelt administration as communist-inspired for ideological reasons, rather than for better wages and working conditions. The most important strike seen as communist-inspired was at the Allis-Chalmers aircraft plant in Los Angeles on 5 June 1941. The plant built bombers for the U. S. and British governments, and the strike was seen as a serious threat to American aid to the Allies. The federal government seized the plant and army troops forced open paths through the picket lines to allow workers to enter the plant.John H. Ohly, Industrialists in Olive Drab (Washington: US Army, Center of Military History, 1999) 14-16, 19-30. World War II and the no- strike pledge The CP's policy toward President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and war changed as soon as Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. At that point, the CP changed into unqualified supporters for the war effort. For their labor allies, that meant not only unconditional support for a wartime no-strike pledge - which the rest of the labor movement had endorsed to some degree - but also opposition to anything that would compromise anti-fascist unity at home. The CP's opponents within the labor movement would also use CP's sudden change against them in the factional battles of the years to come. The change in CP policy led to some startlingly inconsistent positions on its part. When A. Philip Randolph, President of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and the foremost African-American unionist of the time, urged a march on Washington in 1941 to underscore black workers' demands for the elimination of job discrimination in war industries, the CP attacked him relentlessly. This is more than ironic: the CP had championed black workers' rights in the past, even when it complicated their efforts to organize textile workers or miners in the South. The Party had, however, strong political differences with Randolph, even before it became a supporter of the war: he had resigned as head of the National Negro Congress and denounced the CP when the CP broke with the Roosevelt Administration. When Hitler attacked the Soviet Union it continued to attack Randolph's proposed March, but now on the ground that it undermined the unity needed to win the war. The CP did not, on the other hand, abandon its support for civil rights, supporting the creation of the Fair Employment Practices Committee and fighting for equal treatment of black workers in the unions in which they had a presence. These battles were particularly fierce within the UAW, many of whose white members had engaged in hate strikes to protest either the hiring or promotion of black workers in their plants and who had engaged in the massive race riots in Detroit in 1943. That battle inevitably became part of the larger battle between the Addes and Frankensteen group within the UAW, which the CP supported, and the Walter Reuther-led opposition. While each faction supported creation of a 'minority department' within the UAW to deal with the special needs of black and other minority workers and the education of UAW members generally, they disagreed over whether the head of that department should always be African-American. In the end, the 1943 UAW Convention defeated both sides' proposals on a voice vote after a heated debate in which many delegates opposed taking any stand on civil rights as being outside the union's economic sphere. The CP was more vocal and consistent in supporting the wartime no-strike pledge - a position that ultimately cost it much support within the labor movement. The CIO and the AFL each supported the pledge in general, particularly after the furor strikes in the aircraft industry and at Allis-Chalmers Company had provoked in the years immediately before the United States' entry into the war. But the CP and its allies now embraced the pledge with such fervor, at the expense of traditional union principles some said, that it made the Party's commitment to unionism suspect. Harry Bridges of the International Longshore Workers Union (ILWU) called for a speedup of the pace of work - which may not have been inconsistent with the union's goal of controlling the way that work was done on the docks - but certainly sounded strange coming from the union that had previous relentlessly fought employers on the issue. Bridges, Joseph Curran of the NMU and Julius Emspak of the UE even supported a proposal by Roosevelt in 1944 to militarize some civilian workplaces, but retreated when the rest of the CIO executive board reacted furiously against it. The CP also supported piecework systems in the electrical and automobile industries, which it defended as both necessary to boost production and a way to improve workers' earnings under the wartime wage control systems imposed by the War Labor Board, but which were still anathema, particularly to unionists in mass production industries such as automobile manufacturing. Walter Reuther used this issue to great effect against the CP and its allies at the UAW's 1943 Convention, where his slate fell just short of defeating Addes and Frankensteen. On the other hand, the CP mended fences with Sidney Hillman and others within the CIO leadership by coming out strongly in support of Roosevelt for the duration of the war and working diligently in the CIO's political efforts. The Party also grew tremendously during the war years and even took the step, in the wake of the formal alliance between the United States and the Soviet Union, to formally dissolve itself, or at least rename itself as the Communist Political Association in 1944. That attempt to submerge itself in the broader coalition to support Roosevelt and the Soviet Union probably did more to damage the Party's standing with many of its most reliable supporters than to make it look safe or respectable to people outside the Party. The Comintern changed direction a year later, when it ejected Browder from the Party, reestablished the CPUSA and installed Foster as its Chairman. More money less work. The post-war era and expulsion from the CIO The CP suffered a series of setbacks in the immediate postwar era. The most serious was their complete rout in the UAW, where Walter Reuther's slate finally triumphed in 1947 after years of inconclusive struggles with the Addes and Frankensteen faction. Reuther subsequently drove all of his principal CP adversaries out of the UAW, using one of the provisions of the newly enacted Taft-Hartley Act to complete the process. In 1946 the Republican Party took control of both the House and Senate. That Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which, among other things, required all union officers to sign an affidavit that they were not Communists in order for the union to bring a case before the NLRB. Reuther had three of the CP-leaning leaders of UAW Local 248 in Milwaukee - one of the CP's bastions and including some of Reuther's bitterest enemies - expelled for their refusal to sign the oath. The CIO itself was slower to join the purge. Persons associated with the CP did, in fact, exercise a good deal of influence in a number of CIO unions in the 1940s, both in the leadership of unions such as the ILWU, UE, Transport Workers Union of America and Fur and Leather Workers and in staff positions in a number of other unions. Those persons had an uneasy relationship with Murray while he headed the CIO. He mistrusted the radicalism of some of their positions and was innately far more sympathetic to anti-Communist organizations such as the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists. He also believed, however, that making anti-Communism a crusade would only strengthen labor's enemies and the rival AFL at a time when labor unity was most important. Murray might have let the status quo continue, even while Reuther and others within the CIO attacked Communists in their unions, if the CPUSA had not chosen to back Henry A. Wallace's third party campaign for President in 1948. That, and an increasingly bitter division over whether the CIO should support the Marshall Plan, brought Murray to the conclusion that peaceful co- existence with Communists within the CIO was impossible. Murray began by removing Bridges from his position as the California Regional Director for the CIO and letting go first Len De Caux in late 1947 and Lee Pressman in early 1948. Anti-communist unionists then took the battle to the City and State Councils, where they attempted to oust Communist leaders who did not support the CIO's position on the Marshall Plan and Wallace. A number of former allies or members of the Party, including Mike Quill of the Transport Workers and Joseph Curran of the National Maritime Union, severed their ties with the CP and fired the CP members on their staffs during this time. After the 1948 election, the CIO took the fight one step further in 1950, expelling the ILWU, the Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers Union, the Farm Equipment Union, the Food and Tobacco Workers, and the Fur and Leather Workers, while creating a new union, the International Union of Electrical Workers, to replace the UE, which left the CIO rather than purge its leadership. The CP, which once held positions of influence at every level within the CIO and many of its affiliates, was now driven out of the CIO. The years since The CP has, for all effects and purposes, no presence in or influence on the American union movement. Some of the expelled unions, such as the ILWU and UE, survived outside the AFL-CIO, maintaining their political principles, in particular solidarity with labor's struggles around the world and greater rank-and-file control of the union, but have no political relationship with the CP and only marginal influence within the labor movement as a whole. The ILWU has since reaffiliated with the AFL- CIO. Others, such as Mine, Mill, survived; it later merged with its ideological opponent, the Steelworkers, just as the Farm Equipment union eventually was absorbed by the UE. Others, such as the Food and Tobacco Workers, disappeared. To the extent that the CP has had any residual effect on the American union movement, after helping to organize some industrial unions, its only legacy has been its opposition to racial discrimination and its commitment to organizing the lowest-paid workers. \\"Old left\\" unionists played an important role in organizing hospital workers into District 1199 in New York in the 1950s and 1960s; CP veterans also contributed to the organizing successes of the United Farm Workers. But by the 1950s and 1960s, present and former members of the CPUSA did not advertise their membership or try to use organizing victories to recruit new members. The Party by that time was too weak, membership having declined fairly continuously since early in the Eisenhower (and McCarthy) era.

British Journal of Psychology 2:307‚Äì320 The illusion is also known as the false spiral, or by its original name, the twisted cord illusion. The overlapping black arc segments appear to form a spiral; however, the arcs are a series of concentric circles. The visual distortion is produced by combining a regular line pattern (the circles) with misaligned parts (the differently colored strands). Z√∂llner's illusion and the caf√© wall illusion are based on a similar principle, like many other visual effects, in which a sequence of tilted elements causes the eye to perceive phantom twists and deviations. The illusion is augmented by the spiral components in the checkered background. It is a unique illusion, where the observer can verify the concentric strands manually. When the strands are highlighted in a different colour, it becomes obvious to the observer that no spiral is present.See See also * Op-art * Mathematics and art References External links *Fraser's Spiral from MathWorld * An interactive Fraser Spiral Category:Optical illusions ","title":"Fraser spiral illusion"},{"id":"336452","text":"The 84th \\"Givati\\" Brigade (, literally \\"Hill Brigade\\" or \\"Highland Brigade\\") is an Israel Defense Forces infantry brigade.

At the start of the 1948 Palestine war, the brigade was charged with operations in the central region of Israel, participating in operations Hametz, Barak and Pleshet. As the war entered its second stage, Givati became the 5th Brigade, was moved to the south, and concentrated mainly around Gedera, Gan Yavne and Be'er Tuvia. One battalion fought on the Jerusalem front, participating in Operation Nachshon and the Battles of Latrun. When Israel declared independence, Givati consisted of 5 battalions, with notable commanders such as Jehuda Wallach (51st Battalion), Ya'akov Pri (52nd Battalion), Yitzhak Pundak (53rd Battalion), Tzvi Tzur (54th Battalion) and Eitan Livni (55th Battalion). A sixth battalion (the 57th) was founded on May 30, 1948 from Irgun veterans, in preparation for Operation Pleshet. The brigade or parts thereof subsequently participated in the Battle of Nitzanim, Operation An-Far, Operation Yoav, etc. It was converted into a reserve brigade in 1956 and its 51st \\"HaBokim HaRishonim\\" infantry battalion transferred to the Golani Brigade. = 1980s = Givati was reestablished as a mechanized infantry brigade and then proceeded on to amphibious warfare in 1983. At the time it was intended that the Brigade serve as marines, but this has not been effected. In 1986 the brigade's purple beret was officially approved. Since 1999 it serves under Israel's Southern Command. = 2002‚Äì2003 = The Givati Brigade served under the Southern Command and was deployed in the Gaza Strip. The brigade was awarded a medal of honor for its service in the Gaza Strip during the last two years of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, when under the command of Imad Fares. Under Fares' command, Givati carried out thousands of operations in the Gaza Strip. = 2004 = The brigade continued its operations in the Gaza Strip under the command of Eyal Eisenberg and the new head of Southern Command, Dan Harel. Givati's Recon Battalion, the Dolev combat engineering platoon and the Bedouin scouts battalion, won a recommendation of honor, mainly for their activities against Rafah's smuggling tunnels. Givati forces, combined with a special combat engineering tunnels unit, and IDF Caterpillar D9 armoured bulldozers, managed to suppress most of Rafah's tunnels. On May 11 and May 12, 2004, two armored personnel carriers of Givati's Dolev engineering battalion were destroyed by Palestinian militants. The two separate attacks, in Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood and the Philadelphi Route near Rafah and the Egyptian border, claimed the lives of 11 soldiers. Islamic Jihad militants captured some of the remains, causing outrage in Israel. Following international pressure and further Israeli operations in Zeitoun, the bodies of soldiers were returned to Israel. In the Zeitoun incident, UNRWA ambulances were used as transport by healthy Palestinian fighters.http://canadiancoalition.com/unrwa/Reuters- UNAmblulance-110504.wmv In an interview with Haaretz, Israel's Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz also said that UNRWA's ambulances were used by Palestinian militants in order to smuggle some of the remains of IDF soldiers killed in Zaitoun neighbourhood in Gaza on May 11, 2004.http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/427679.html UNRWA has described the May 11 incident as a hijacking. Members of the Givati Brigade praying at the Western Wall, 2010 The reconnaissance company of the Givati Brigade during an exercise, 2009 After two more soldiers were killed in Rafah, Israel launched Operation Rainbow. This involved Givati forces reinforced by Golani Brigade soldiers with IDF Achzarit HAPCs, a battalion of officers from the class-commanders school and several IDF Caterpillar D9 armoured bulldozers. The stated aim of Operation Rainbow was to destroy the terror infrastructure of Rafah, destroy smuggling tunnels and stop illegal missile shipment. The brigade's Shaked battalion, under the command of a Lt. Col. \\"Ofer\\" (surname not publicized) was rocked by scandals in the second half of 2004 while stationed in the southern Gaza Strip.

It marked an end to the 38 year IDF presence in the Gaza Strip. Today, two battalions are stationed outside the Strip, while the third battalion is positioned on the northern border. = 2006 = On June 27, in response to Hamas' kidnapping of Corporal Gilad Shalit, the IDF started an offensive in the Gaza Strip to repel the continuous rockets being fired into the Israeli town outside of Gaza and to pressure Hamas to release Shalit. Givati, together with the Golani Brigade, Engineering Corps and the Armored Corps, participated in Operation \\"Summer Rains.\\" However, Israel failed to achieve the release of Shalit, and a November 26 ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Palestinian groups forced Israel to withdraw its forces. Captain \\"R\\", the former Misayat Shaked company commander who was accused in \\"confirming kill\\" of 13-year-old Iman al-Hams in Rafah in October 2004, and was acquitted in court, received NIS 80,000 in compensation from the state, according to a December 14 Ha'aretz report.

It also participated in the ground phase of Operation Cast Lead, when of all IDF brigades, it penetrated deepest into Gaza City. The brigade's reconnaissance battalion entered the Tel el-Hawa neighborhood in search of Hamas operatives two days before the cease fire went into effect. An estimated 40 Palestinian gunmen were killed as dozens of apartments were swept.

During a US-brokered humanitarian ceasefire, elements of the brigade's reconnaissance company were attacked by Hamas fighters in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, near the border with Egypt. Three soldiers, including the company commander of the Givati Reconnaissance Company (Sayeret Givati), were killed in the ensuing firefight. The squad of Hamas fighters dragged an injured lieutenant's body into a tunnel, and the assistant company commander took a small group of soldiers with him into the tunnel in an attempt to rescue the injured lieutenant. The IDF Rabbinate later declared the lieutenant deceased for the purposes of Jewish burial and grieving rituals, and Hamas has up to the present claimed to be in custody of the lieutenant's body. The assistant company commander was later awarded Israel's highest military honor, and the soldiers that accompanied him into the tunnel were also awarded military commendations. The Givati Brigade was the most highly decorated brigade in the IDF in 2014, partially as a result of action seen during the summer 2014 conflict. = 2015 = In January 2015, a convoy belonging to the Tsabar Battalion of the Givati Brigade was attacked by Hezbollah in Shebaa Farms.

A subsidiary of United Records, it was in business from May 1952 to December 1957. States focused on rhythm and blues, jazz, and gospel.

The most important blues artist to record for States was Junior Wells, making his debut as a leader; he cut sessions for the company in 1953 and 1954. In the down-home category, Allen also released singles by Robert Nighthawk and Big Walter Horton, as well as pianist Eddie Ware, guitarist L. C. McKinley, and drummer James Bannister. Standup blues singers to record for the label included Edward \\"The Great Gates\\" White (accompanied on his outing by Tom Archia and Red Saunders), Cliff Butler, Arbee Stidham, Jack Cooley, and Harold Burrage. States issued juke-box jazz sides by tenor saxophonists Paul Bascomb, Jimmy Coe, and Cozy Eggleston. A few forays into the Detroit scene produced rhythm and blues by Sax Kari, Jimmy Hamilton, T. J. Fowler, and Helen Thompson. States became involved in doo-wop in 1953 when Allen recorded The Hornets. He soon added The Danderliers, the Five Chances, The Strollers and The Palms. The vocal groups were rehearsed by Al Smith, who also led studio bands featuring such performers as guitarist Lefty Bates, tenor saxophonist Red Holloway, and drummer Vernel Fournier. In gospel, The Caravans were a mainstay of the label throughout its existence. Eventually, Allen added the Genesa Smith Singers and the Lucy Smith Singers.

After the company closed, Savoy Records, which had signed the group and was seeking to consolidate its position in gospel music, bought this rich cache of material.

At the well, he noted two barrels, also ancient columns, one with white marble, the second gray granite, which were, he thought, exhumed in that area and did not come from elsewhere.Gu√©rin, 1869, p. 127 An Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed Kokabe with a population of 72, in 20 houses, though the population count included men, only.Socin, 1879, p. 156Hartmann, 1883, p. 133, also noted 20 houses In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described it as a small adobe village, with a well to the west and a pool to the north.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 260 The village had a rectangular layout along the above-mentioned road, and expanded north-south alongside it. =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Kukaba had a population of 439, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table V, Sub-district of Gaza, p. 8 increasing in the 1931 census to 522, still all Muslims, in 121 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 4. Kawkaba 1931 1:20,000 Kawkaba 1945 1:20,000 Kawkaba shared an elementary school with the villages of Bayt Tima and Hulayqat. Its houses were made of adobe and cement, and its shops were located at the village center, on the western side of the road. On its eastern site were two water sources: a spring and a 70-meter deep well. The villagers engaged in rainfed agriculture, cultivating grain and winter and summer vegetables. Towards the end of the British Mandate period they also cultivated fruits, such as figs and grapes, on all their land expect to the west. In the 1945 statistics the population of Kaukaba was 680 Muslims, while the total land area was 8,542 dunams, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, a total of 166 dunams were used for plantations and irrigable land, 8,166 for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945.

The fall of the village was preceded by the events at nearby Burayr; where the Haganah Oded Brigade apparently executed a large number of military age Palestinians.

Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel and in 1950 the moshav of Kokhav Michael was founded on village land, southeast of the village site. According to Khalidi, by 1992 the remaining structures on the village land were: > \\"The site is overgrown with sycamore and Christ¬¥s -thorn trees.

The label was founded by Jack Lauderdale in 1947 as Down Beat Records and was headquartered in Los Angeles, California. In approximately October 1949 the name was changed to Swing Beat Records, and around March 1950 the name was changed again to Swing Time. The company went bankrupt in 1953 but continued releasing singles as late as February 1954. Ray Charles, Percy Mayfield, Lowell Fulson, and other rhythm and blues and swing era artists of the 1940s first recorded for this company. It is possible to find certain releases on more than one label name. Leasing, purchasing, reissuing, signings Lauderdale started his label by recording the Lucky Thompson Quartet with Dodo Marmarosa in late 1946 (releasing three discs during 1947). Felix Gross & His Sextet were another early signing (releasing eight discs during 1947 through 1949). He then leased/reissued recordings by the Five Soul Stirrers from Bronze Records (releasing three discs in 1947). Next up was the leasing/reissuing of Lowell Fulson's recordings for Bob Geddins' Big Town/Down Town/Cava-Tone group of labels and the Bob Geddins/Rene LaMarre-partnered Trilon label (a total of 12 discs were released starting in 1947 through 1949). Jack also got masters of Jimmy McCracklin & His Blues Blasters from Trilon. In 1950 Lauderdale purchased all the master recordings by the Charles Brown-led Johnny Moore's Three Blazers from Leon Ren√©'s Exclusive Records, plus the masters by Brown's ex-wife, Mabel Scott. Lauderdale purchased Al Patrick's defunct Supreme Records label and reissued recordings by Jimmy Witherspoon with Jay McShann's band featuring Louis Speiginer on guitar, Paula Watson, Percy Mayfield, Floyd Dixon with bass player Eddie Williams' Trio (AKA The Brown Buddies), Sister Emily Bram, the Stars of Harmony gospel group, and Maxwell Davis' band with Marshal Royal starting in late 1950 through 1951. Added to all this activity was the signing of pianist Lloyd Glenn as recording artist/house band leader/session arranger and label A&R; man. Also signed-up were Pete Johnson's band with Big Joe Turner, and the Maxin/Maxim Trio with Ray Charles. Dexter Gordon's quintet with Wardell Gray recorded a session (releasing two discs), and songwriter/bass player Shifty Henry recorded for the Swing Time label (one disc released in 1950). Two late signings were Play Boy Thomas (two discs recorded/released in 1953), and the Hollywood Flames featuring Bobby Byrd (one disc in 1954). Several Swing Time recordings (i.e. all the holiday singles) were given permanent lease to Hollywood Records. Numbering system The Down Beat/Swing Beat/Swing Time Records numbering system ran from #100 (1947) through #347 (1954). Lauderdale also started up a subsidiary label in late 1952: his Flame Records numbering system ran from #1001 through #1009.

In 1795 the third and the last of the three 18th- century partitions of Poland ended the existence of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Nevertheless, events both within and outside the Polish lands kept hopes for restoration of Polish independence alive throughout the 19th century. Poland's geopolitical location on the Northern European Lowlands became especially important in a period when its expansionist neighbors, the Kingdom of Prussia and Imperial Russia, involved themselves intensely in European rivalries and alliances as modern nation-states took form over the entire continent. The Napoleonic period Napoleon's Duchy of Warsaw (1807‚Äì1815) At the turn of the 19th century, Europe had begun to feel the impact of momentous political and intellectual movements that, among their other effects, would keep the \\"Polish Question\\" on the agenda of international issues needing resolution. Most immediately, Napoleon Bonaparte had established a new empire in France in 1804 following that country's revolution. Other powers' refusal of the new status of France kept Europe at war for the next decade and brought him into conflict with the same east European powers that had beleaguered Poland in the last decades of the previous century. An alliance of convenience was the natural result of this situation. Volunteer Polish legions attached themselves to Bonaparte's armies, hoping that in return the emperor would allow an independent Poland to reappear out of his conquests. Although Napoleon promised more than he ever intended to deliver to the Polish cause, in 1807 he created a Duchy of Warsaw from Prussian territory that had been part of old Poland and was still inhabited by Poles. Basically a French puppet, the duchy did enjoy some degree of self-government, and many Poles believed that further Napoleonic victories would bring restoration of the entire commonwealth. In 1809, under Jozef Poniatowski, nephew of Stanislaw II August, the duchy reclaimed some of the territories taken by Austria in the third partition. The Russian army occupied the duchy as it chased Napoleon out of Russia in 1813, however, and Polish expectations ended with the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815. In the subsequent peace settlement of the Congress of Vienna, the victorious Austrians and Prussians swept away the Duchy of Warsaw and reconfirmed most of the terms of the final partition of Poland. Although brief, the Napoleonic period occupies an important place in Polish history. Much of the legend and symbolism of modern Polish patriotism derives from this period, including the conviction that Polish independence is a necessary element of a just and legitimate European order. This conviction was simply expressed in a fighting slogan of the time, \\"for your freedom and ours.\\" Moreover, the appearance of the Duchy of Warsaw so soon after the partitions proved that the seemingly final historical death sentence delivered in 1795 was not necessarily the end of the Polish nation-state. Instead, many observers came to believe that favourable circumstances would free Poland from foreign domination. The impact of nationalism and romanticism The intellectual and artistic climate of the early 19th century further stimulated the growth of Polish demands for self-government. During these decades, modern nationalism took shape and rapidly developed a massive following throughout the continent, becoming the most dynamic and appealing political doctrine of its time. By stressing the value and dignity of native cultures and languages, nationalism offered a rationale for ethnic loyalty and Romanticism was the artistic element of 19th- century European culture that exerted the strongest influence on the Polish national consciousness. The Romantic movement was a natural partner of political nationalism, for it echoed the nationalist sympathy for folk cultures and manifested a general air of disdain for the conservative political order of post-Napoleonic Europe. Under this influence, Polish literature flourished anew in the works of a school of 19th-century Romantic poets, led by Adam Mickiewicz. Mickiewicz concentrated on patriotic themes and the glorious national past. Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, a leading composer of the century, also used the tragic history of his nation as a major inspiration. Nurtured by these influences, nationalism awoke first among the intelligentsia and certain segments of the nobility, then more gradually in the peasantry. At the end of the process, a broader definition of nationhood had replaced the old class-based \\"noble patriotism\\" of Poland. The era of national insurrections For several decades, the Polish national movement gave priority to the immediate restoration of independence, a drive that found expression in a series of armed rebellions. The insurgencies arose mainly in the Russian zone of partition to the east, about three-quarters of which was formerly Polish territory. After the Congress of Vienna, Russia had organized its Polish lands as the Congress Poland, granting it a quite liberal constitution, its own army, and limited autonomy within the tsarist empire. In the 1820s, however, Russian rule grew more arbitrary, and secret societies were formed by intellectuals in several cities to plot an insurrection. In November 1830, Polish troops in Warsaw rose in revolt. When the government of Congress Poland proclaimed solidarity with the rebel forces shortly thereafter, a new Polish-Russian war began. The rebels' requests for aid from France were ignored, and their reluctance to abolish serfdom cost them the support of the peasantry. By September 1831, the Russians had subdued Polish resistance and forced 6,000 resistance fighters into exile in France, beginning a time of harsh repression of intellectual and religious activity throughout Poland. At the same time, Congress Poland lost its constitution and its army. After the failure of the November Revolt, clandestine conspiratorial activity continued on Polish territory. An exiled Polish political and intellectual elite established a base of operations in Paris. A conservative group headed by Adam Jerzy Czartoryski (one of the leaders of the November Revolt) relied on foreign diplomatic support to restore Poland's status as established by the Congress of Vienna, which Russia had routinely violated beginning in 1819. Otherwise, this group was satisfied with a return to monarchy and traditional social structures. The radical factions never formed a united front on any issue besides the general goal of independence. Their programs insisted that the Poles liberate themselves by their own efforts and linked independence with republicanism and the emancipation of the serfs. Handicapped by internal division, limited resources, heavy surveillance, and persecution of revolutionary cells in Poland, the Polish national movement suffered numerous losses. The movement sustained a major setback in the 1846 revolt organized in Austrian Poland by the Polish Democratic Society, the leading radical nationalist group. The uprising ended in a bloody fiasco when the peasantry took up arms against the rebel leadership dominated by nobility and gentry, which was regarded as potentially a worse oppressor than the Austrians. By incurring harsh military repression from Austria, the failed revolt left the Polish nationalists in a poor position to participate in the wave of national revolution that crossed Europe in 1848 and 1849. The stubborn idealism of this uprising's leaders emphasized individual liberty and separate national identity rather than establishment of a unified republic‚Äîa significant change of political philosophy from earlier movements. The last and most tenacious of the Polish uprisings of the mid-19th century erupted in the Russian-occupied sector in January 1863 (see January Uprising). Following Russia's disastrous defeat in the Crimean War, the government of Tsar Alexander II enacted a series of liberal reforms, including liberation of the serfs throughout the empire. The high-handed imposition of land reforms in Poland aroused hostility among the conservative landed nobility on the one hand, and a group of young radical intellectuals influenced by Karl Marx and the Russian liberal Alexander Herzen, on the other. Repeating the pattern of 1830‚Äì31, the open revolt of the January Insurrection by Congress Poland failed to win foreign backing. Although its socially progressive program could not mobilize the peasants, the rebellion persisted stubbornly for fifteen months. After finally crushing the insurgency in August 1864, Russia abolished the Congress Poland altogether and revoked the separate status of the Polish lands, incorporating them directly as the Western Region of the Russian Empire. The region was placed under the dictatorial rule of Mikhail Muravyov- Vilensky, who became known as the Hangman of Vilnius. All Polish citizens were assimilated into the empire. When Russia officially emancipated the Polish serfs in early 1864, an act that constituted the most important event in history of nineteenth-century Poland, it removed a major rallying point from the agenda of potential Polish revolutionaries. The time of \\"Organic Work\\" Increasing oppression at Russian hands after failed national uprisings finally convinced Polish leaders that the recent insurrection was premature. During the decades that followed the January Insurrection, Poles largely forsook the goal of immediate independence and turned instead to fortifying the nation through the subtler means of education, economic development, and modernization. This approach took the name \\"Organic Work\\" (Praca organiczna) for its philosophy of strengthening Polish society at the grass roots, influenced by positivism. For some, the adoption of Organic Work meant permanent resignation to foreign rule, but many advocates recommended it as a strategy to combat repression while awaiting an eventual opportunity to achieve self-government. Neither as colorful as the rebellions nor as loftily enshrined in national memory, the quotidian methods of Organic Work proved well suited to the political conditions of the later 19th century. The international balance of forces did not favour the recovery of statehood when both Russia and Germany appeared bent on the eventual eradication of Polish national identity. The German Empire, established in 1871 as an expanded version of the Prussian state, aimed at the assimilation of its eastern provinces inhabited by Poles. At the same time, St. Petersburg attempted to russify the former Congress Poland, joining Berlin in levying restrictions against use of the Polish language and cultural expression. Poles under Russian and German rule also endured official campaigns against the Roman Catholic Church: the Cultural Struggle (Kulturkampf) of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck to bring the Roman Catholic Church under state control and the Russian campaign to extend Orthodoxy throughout the empire. The Polish subjects under Austrian jurisdiction (after 1867 the Habsburg Empire was commonly known as Austria‚ÄìHungary) confronted a generally more lenient regime. Poles suffered no religious persecution in predominantly Catholic Austria, and Vienna counted on the Polish nobility as allies in the complex political calculus of its multinational realm. In return for loyalty, Austrian Poland, or Galicia, received considerable administrative and cultural autonomy. Galicia gained a reputation as an oasis of toleration amidst the oppression of German and Russian Poland. The Galician provincial Sejm acted as a semiautonomous parliamentary body, and Poles represented the region in the empire government in Vienna. In the late 19th century, the universities of Krak√≥w and Lw√≥w became the centers of Polish intellectual activity, and Krak√≥w became the center of Polish art and thought. Even after the restoration of independence, many residents of southern Poland retained a touch of nostalgia for the days of the Habsburg Empire. Social and political transformation Profound social and economic forces operated on the Polish lands throughout the late 19th century, giving them a more modern aspect and altering traditional patterns of life. Especially in Russian Poland and the Silesian regions under German control, mining and manufacturing started on a large scale. This development sped the process of urbanization, and the emergence of capitalism began to reduce the relative importance of the landed aristocracy in Polish society. A considerable segment of the peasantry abandoned the overburdened land. Millions of Poles emigrated to North America and other destinations, and millions more migrated to cities to form the new industrial labour force. These shifts stimulated fresh social tensions. Urban workers bore the full range of hardships associated with early capitalism, and the intensely nationalistic atmosphere of the day bred frictions between Poles and the other peoples remaining from the old heterogeneous Commonwealth of Two Nations. The movement of the former noble class into cities created a new urban professional class. However, the peasants that tried to move to the cities, found all the better positions already occupied by Jews and Germans. This contributed to the national tensions among the Poles, Germans and Jews. At this time the Jewish population in Prussian Poland tended to identify with and want to belong to Germany, insofar as the latter, like the Jews themselves, had a more urbanized, cosmopolitan outlook. Another factor, not to be overlooked or underestimated is the traditional language spoken by the Ashkenazi Jews of Central and Eastern Europe, Yiddish, is also a Germanic language written in Hebrew characters, which afforded some natural compatibility with the German language dominated Austria-Hungarian and Prussian cultures. These transformations changed the face of politics as well, giving rise to new parties and movements that would dominate the Polish landscape for the next century. The grievances of the lower classes led to the formation of peasant and socialist parties. Communism gained only a marginal following, but a more moderate socialist faction led by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski won broader support through its emphatic advocacy of Polish independence. By 1905 Pi≈Çsudski's party, the Polish Socialist Party, was the largest socialist party in the entire Russian Empire. The National Democracy of Roman Dmowski became the leading vehicle of the right by espousing a doctrine that combined nationalism with hostility toward Jews and other minorities. By the turn of the 20th century, Polish political life had emerged from the relative quiescence of Organic Work and entered a stage of renewed assertiveness. In particular, Pi≈Çsudski and Dmowski had initiated what would be long careers as the paramount figures in the civic affairs of Poland. After 1900 political activity was suppressed only in the Prussian sector. First World War At the outbreak of the First World War Poland's geographical position between Germany and Russia had meant much fighting and terrific human and material losses for the Poles between 1914 and 1918. At the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in spring 1918, revolutionary Russia renounced Russian claims to Poland. Following the German defeat and the replacement of Hohenzollern rule by the Weimar Republic and the collapse of Habsburg Austria-Hungary, Poland became an independent republic. =War and the Polish lands= The war split the ranks of the three partitioning empires, pitting Russia as defender of Serbia and ally of Britain and France against the leading members of the Central Powers, Germany and Austria-Hungary. This circumstance afforded the Poles political leverage as both sides offered pledges of concessions and future autonomy in exchange for Polish loyalty and army recruits. The Austrians wanted to incorporate Congress Poland into their territory of Galicia, so even before the war they allowed nationalist organisations to form there (for example, ZwiƒÖzek Strzelecki). The Russians recognized the Polish right to autonomy and allowed formation of the Polish National Committee, which supported the Russian side. In 1916, attempting to increase Polish support for the Central Powers and to raise a Polish army the German and Austrian emperors declared a new Kingdom of Poland, (see Regency Kingdom of Poland (1916‚Äì1918). The new Kingdom consisted only of a small part of the old Commonwealth, i.e. the territory of Congress Poland, although some promises were made about a future incorporation of Vilna and Minsk. The Kingdom was ruled by three Regents, possessed a Parliament and a Government, a small army and its own currency, called the Polish mark. The Regency Kingdom was the fourth and last monarchy in Poland's history. As the war settled into a long stalemate, the issue of Polish self-rule gained greater urgency. Roman Dmowski spent the war years in Western Europe, hoping to persuade the Allies to unify the Polish lands under Russian rule as an initial step toward liberation. In the meantime, Pi≈Çsudski had correctly predicted that the war would ruin all three of the partitioners, a conclusion most people thought highly unlikely before 1918. Pi≈Çsudski therefore formed the Polish Legions to assist the Central Powers in defeating Russia as the first step toward full independence for Poland. Poniatowski Bridge in Warsaw after being blown up by the retreating Russian Army in 1915. Much of the heavy fighting on the war's Eastern Front took place on the territory of the former Polish state. In 1914 Russian forces advanced very close to Krak√≥w before being beaten back. The next spring, heavy fighting occurred around Gorlice and Przemy≈õl, to the east of Krak√≥w in Galicia. In 1915 Polish territories were looted and abandoned by the retreating Russian army, trying to emulate the scorched earth policy of 1812;Roger Chickering, Stig F√∂rster, Great War, Total War: Combat and Mobilization on the Western Front, 1914‚Äì1918, Cambridge University Press, 2000, , Google Print, p.160 the Russians also evicted and deported hundreds of thousands of its inhabitants suspected of collaborating with the enemy.Barnett R. Rubin, Jack L. Snyder, Post-Soviet Political Order: Conflict and State Building, Routledge, 1998, , Google Print, p.43Alan Kramer, Dynamic of Destruction: Culture and Mass Killing in the First World War, Oxford University Press, 2007, , Google Print, p.151 By the end of 1915, the Germans had occupied the entire Russian sector, including Warsaw. In 1916 another Russian offensive in Galicia exacerbated the already desperate situation of civilians in the war zone; about 1 million Polish refugees fled eastward behind Russian lines during the war. Although the Russian offensive of 1916 caught the Germans and Austrians by surprise, poor communications and logistics prevented the Russians from taking full advantage of their situation. A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and 450,000 died. Several hundred thousand Polish civilians were moved to labour camps in Germany. The scorched- earth retreat strategies of both sides left much of the war zone uninhabitable. =Recovery of statehood= In 1917 two separate events decisively changed the character of the war and set it on a course toward the rebirth of Poland. The United States entered the conflict on the Allied side, while a process of revolutionary upheaval in Russia weakened her and then removed the Russians from the Eastern Front, finally bringing the Bolsheviks to power in that country. The army of Tsarist Russia ceased to be a factor when the Bolsheviks pulled Russia out of the war. At Brest-Litovsk the Bolsheviks renounced Russian claims to Poland. Compelled by force of German arms to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk all formerly Polish lands were ceded to the Central Powers. After the German defeat in the Fall of 1918; the overthrow of the Prussian Monarchy and its replacement by the liberal Weimar Republic, the road to an independent Polish state was opened. The vacating of both Russia and Germany from Poland gave free rein to the calls of Woodrow Wilson at the Versailles Peace Conference, echoing those of the new Bolshevik regime, to liberate the Poles and other peoples from Greater Power suzerainty. The thirteenth of Wilson's Fourteen Points adopted the resurrection of Poland as one of the main aims of the First World War. J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski became a popular hero when Berlin jailed him for insubordination. The Allies broke the resistance of the Central Powers by autumn 1918, as the Habsburg monarchy disintegrated and the German imperial government collapsed. In October 1918, Polish authorities took over Galicia and Cieszyn Silesia. In November 1918, Pi≈Çsudski was released from internment in Germany by the revolutionaries and returned to Warsaw. Upon his arrival, on 11 November 1918 the Regency Council of the Kingdom of Poland ceded all responsibilities to him and Pi≈Çsudski took control over the newly created state as its provisional Chief of State. Soon all the local governments that had been created in the last months of the war pledged allegiance to the central government in Warsaw. Independent Poland, which had been absent from the map of Europe for 123 years, was reborn. The newly created state initially consisted of former Congress Poland, western Galicia (with Lw√≥w besieged by the Ukrainians) and part of Cieszyn Silesia.

He was responsible for killing the followers of Cylon of Athens during the attempted coup of 632 BC, as Cylon had taken refuge as a suppliant at the temple of Athena. As a result of their actions, Megacles and his Alcmaeonid followers were the subject of an ongoing curse and were exiled from the city. Even the bodies of buried Alcmaeonidae were dug up and removed from the city limits. The Alcmaeonids were allowed back into the city in 594 BC, during the archonship of Solon.See Gomme, A Historical Commentary on Athens, on 1.126.12. Megacles' son Alcmaeon held command during the first Sacred War: Plutarch, Solon 11.2. During the tyranny of Pisistratus, the Alcmaeonid Megacles married his daughter to Pisistratus, but when the tyrant refused to have children with her, Megacles banished him. Later the Alcmaeonids would claim to have been exiled following Pisistratus' return in 546 BC so as to distance themselves from possible accusations of complicity, but epigraphic evidence in fact proves that Cleisthenes was archon for the year 525‚Äì24. Megacles was able to marry (for a second or third time) Agarista, the daughter of the tyrant Cleisthenes of Sicyon. They had two sons, Hippocrates and Cleisthenes, the reformer of the Athenian democracy. Hippocrates' daughter was Agariste, the mother of Pericles. This Cleisthenes overthrew Hippias, the son and successor of Pisistratus, in 508 BC. He had bribed the oracle at Delphi (which the Alcmaeonidae had helped to build while they were in exile) to convince the Spartans to help him, which they reluctantly did. Cleisthenes was, at first, opposed by some who felt the curse made the Alcmaeonidae ineligible to rule; the Spartan king Cleomenes I even turned against Cleisthenes and the latter was briefly exiled once more. However, the citizens called for Cleisthenes to return, and the restored Alcmaeonids were responsible for laying the foundations of Athenian democracy. The Alcmaeonidae were said to have negotiated for an alliance with the Persians during the Persian Wars, despite the fact that Athens was leading the resistance to the Persian invasion. Pericles and Alcibiades also belonged to the Alcmaeonidae, and during the Peloponnesian War the Spartans referred to the family's curse in an attempt to discredit Pericles. Alcibiades, as the previous generation of Alcmaeonidae had done, tried to ally with the Persians after he was accused of impiety. The family disappeared after Athens's defeat in the Peloponnesian War. Family tree Because of a family tradition of naming descendants after their forebears, members of the family can easily be confused. Hence, what follows is a partial family tree of the historical Alcmaeonid family. Males are in blue, females in red, and those related by marriage in white.

Most of Fiordland is dominated by the steep sides of the snow-capped Southern Alps, deep lakes, and its steep, glacier- carved and now ocean-flooded western valleys. The name \\"Fiordland\\" comes from a variant spelling of the Scandinavian word for this type of steep valley, \\"fjord\\". The area of Fiordland is dominated by, and very roughly coterminous with, Fiordland National Park, New Zealand's largest National Park. Due to the often steep terrain and high amount of rainfall supporting dense vegetation, the interior of the Fiordland region is largely inaccessible. As a result, Fiordland was never subjected to notable logging operations, and even attempts at whaling, seal hunting, and mining were on a small scale and shortlived, partly also because of the challenging weather. Today, Fiordland contains by far the greatest extent of unmodified vegetation in New Zealand and significant populations of endemic plants and threatened animals, in some cases the only remaining wild populations. Fiordland features a number of fiords, which in this area are typically named sounds, reflecting the fact that sometimes fiords are considered to be a type of a narrow sound. Of the twelve major fiords on Fiordland's west coast, Milford Sound / Piopiotahi is the most famous and the only one accessible by road. Doubtful Sound / Patea, which is much larger, is also a tourist destination, but is less accessible as it requires both a boat trip over Lake Manapouri and bus transfer over Wilmot Pass. Also situated within Fiordland are Browne Falls and Sutherland Falls, which rank among the tallest waterfalls in the world, and New Zealand's three deepest lakes, Lake Hauroko, Lake Manapouri, and Lake Te Anau. Several other large lakes lie nearby, and Fiordland and the surrounding parts of Southland and Otago Regions are often referred to as the Southern Lakes. Only a handful of Fiordland's lakes are accessible by road - Lake Poteriteri is the largest lake in New Zealand with no road access. Many of the region's lakes are not even accessible via tramping tracks. This part of New Zealand, especially to the west of the mountain divide of the Southern Alps, has a very wet climate with annual average of 200 rainy days and annual rainfall varying from in Te Anau to in Milford Sound. The prevailing westerly winds blow moist air from the Tasman Sea onto the mountains, resulting in high amounts of precipitation as the air rises and cools down. History Fiordland has never had any significant permanent population. MƒÅori knew the area well but only visited seasonally, for hunting, fishing and to collect the precious stone pounamu (New Zealand jade) from Anita Bay at the mouth of Milford Sound / Piopiotahi. In MƒÅori mythology, the demi-god T≈´-te-raki-whƒÅnoa carved the fiords from rock using his adze, perfecting his technique as he progressed from south to north, with the last fiord, Piopiotahi (Milford Sound), as his greatest achievement. In 1770, Captain James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to sight Fiordland. Cook returned and anchored in Tamatea / Dusky Sound for five weeks in 1773. The expeditions' maps and descriptions of the area attracted whalers and seal hunters, but only in the mid-19th century did surveyors and prospectors begin exploring Fiordland's interior. Between 1897 and 1908, two attempts at establishing a mining operation in the remote area of Rakituma / Preservation Inlet failed, and by 1914 the isolated small settlement of Cromartie (or Cromarty) there had been abandoned. The area was administered as Fiord County from 1876 until it was absorbed into neighbouring Wallace County in 1981. Since 1989, it has formed part of Southland District and of the wider Southland Region. Boundaries  Fraser Beach on the eastern shore of Lake Manapouri There are currently varying definitions for the boundary of the Fiordland region. The eastern boundary of Fiordland according to Statistics New Zealand stretches from Sand Hill Point on the western end of Te Waewae Bay more or less straight north, cutting through Lakes Hauroko, Monowai, Manapouri, and the South Fiord of Lake Te Anau, before veering northwest and ending with the southern side of Te Houhou / George Sound. By that definition, the Fiordland region is almost entirely within the Fiordland National Park, except for small pockets near the two southernmost lakes, but the area does not include the three northernmost fiords (Milford Sound / Piopiotahi, Te HƒÅpua / Sutherland Sound, and HƒÅwea / Bligh Sound). The much more widespread definition of \\"Fiordland\\" has an eastern boundary that roughly follows that of the Fiordland National Park for all but the northernmost end. This area contains all fiords as well as the Hollyford Valley and also includes the area around Big Bay, which lies to the north outside of the Fiordland National Park, but still belongs to the Southland Region. Tourism organisations and the Department of Conservation use this definition of the Fiordland region. New Zealanders generally regard the towns of Te Anau and Manapouri as part of the Fiordland region, even though they lie outside of the boundary of the national park. Geography Mountains reach over 2500m in the northern parts of Fiordland In geographical terms, the Fiordland region contains the huge mountainous regions west of the line from Te Waewae Bay to Monowai to Te Anau, and includes the valleys of the Eglinton River and Hollyford River / Whakatipu KƒÅ Tuka. The area is almost identical to that of the Fiordland National Park, and is marked by U-shaped valleys and fiords along the coast and steep mountains with foundations of hard rocks like gneiss, schist, granite and diorite, with the softer rock having been carved out by multiple glaciations. Fiordland contains New Zealand's oldest known plutonic (igneous) rocks and is dominated by the southernmost extent of the Southern Alps as the peaks reduce in height from north to south. Snow regularly falls to low altitudes in winter The tallest mountain in the Fiordland region is Mount Tutoko at , one of several peaks over 2,000 meters in the Darren Mountains. Southeast of this area, there are only a handful of peaks reaching 2,000 meters, however due to the rainy weather with cold winters and lack of hot summer temperatures, even these mountains contain glaciers and peaks with permanent snow cover. The southernmost glacier is situated on Caroline Peak, which only reaches , and in the southwest of Fiordland the altitude for permanent snowfields lowers to under . The past glaciation's deep carving out of the landscape has also resulted in fiord-like arms in Lake Manapouri and Lake Te Anau, and on the coast managed to cause several large chunks of the mainland becoming cut off. The largest of these uninhabited offshore islands are Resolution Island and Secretary Island, and are important conservation sites, particularly as sanctuaries for endangered native birds. =Constituent fiords= Milford Sound / Piopiotahi, the most famous tourist destination in Fiordland, and the only fiord accessible by road Twelve fiords, some stretching up to inland, and two inlets leading to three more fiords, extend along the coast from Piopiotahi in the north to Rakituma / Preservation Inlet in the south. In general, the fiords become wider from north to south as the height of the mountains decreases. The outlets of the southernmost fiords have a character more akin to inlets, with only the inner arms such as Long Sound resembling fiords. *Milford Sound / Piopiotahi - the only fiord in the area with road access *Te HƒÅpua / Sutherland Sound *HƒÅwea / Bligh Sound *Te Houhou / George Sound - accessible via tramping track *Taitetimu / Caswell Sound *Taiporoporo / Charles Sound *Hinenui / Nancy Sound *Te Awa-o-T≈´ / Thompson Sound *Doubtful Sound / Patea - accessible via tours and tramping track *Te RƒÅ / Dagg Sound *Te Puaitaha / Breaksea Sound *Tamatea / Dusky Sound - accessible via tramping track *Taiari / Chalky Inlet - leads into Edwardson Sound and Cunaris Sound *Rakituma / Preservation Inlet - leads into Long Sound A further sound, Kaikiekie / Bradshaw Sound, is basically an extension of Thompson and Doubtful Sounds after their junction at the eastern end of Secretary Island. Ecology The area has been categorised as the Fiordland temperate forests ecoregion, having a variety of habitats and due to its isolation a high number of endemic plants. Much of Fiordland is heavily forested except for locations where surface rock exposures are extensive. The natural habitats are almost completely unspoilt. Nothofagus beech trees are dominant in many locations, silver beech (Nothofagus menziesii) in the fiords and red beech (Nothofagus fusca) in the inland valleys. In the understory there are a wide variety of shrubs and ferns, including crown fern (Blechnum discolor), areas of scrubby herbs above the treeline, patches of bog next to mountain streams and finally an area of rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum)-dominated sand dunes in the Waitutu area on the south coast.C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Crown Fern: Blechnum discolor, Globaltwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg Despite a latitude in the mid 40s, the treeline is generally below because of the cool summers and the influence of the southern ocean on the climate. The area is home to threatened native bird species, such as the flightless takahƒì and kiwi, blue duck (whio), and yellowhead (m≈çhua). The takahƒì was presumed to have been extinct for 50 years before a small remaining population was discovered in Fiordland's Murchison Mountains in 1948. Since then, that area has been managed by the Department of Conservation, trapping stoats and controlling deer, helping takahƒì numbers in the area to increase to over 200 and remain at that level. There are also a great number of insects and one indigenous reptile, the Fiordland skink (Oligosoma acrinasum). There are around 300 insect species endemic to the Fiordland region, many of them sizeable, such as weta, large caddis, and giant weevils, and some of them unusual, such as egg-laying worms, alpine cicadas, and brightly coloured alpine moths. There are six species of native sandflies (blackfly, Simuliidae) with one endemic to Fiordland. Most of the area falls under the protection of the Fiordland National Park, part of the Te Wahipounamu World Heritage Site. Fiordland National Park has an area of 12,600 square kilometres, making it the largest national park in New Zealand and one of the larger parks in the world, containing many tourist attractions, such as Milford Sound, Doubtful Sound and the Milford Track. The main threat to natural habitats is from introduced species, especially red deer, but these are now being hunted out of the area, and furthermore the park includes a number of small offshore islands which are free from introduced species and are designated Specially Protected Areas. Several offshore areas of Fiordland are protected as part of Fiordland's marine reserves.  Demographics and economy  Tour boats at Milford Sound / Piopiotahi Apart from the areas around the townships of Te Anau and Manapouri, at the edge of Fiordland, the Fiordland region has never had more than a few human inhabitants and is the least-populated area of the South Island (12 residents in 2013, virtually uninhabited),Note that the census area cited here is the area defined as \\"Fiordland\\" by Statistics New Zealand. with no villages or towns, and many areas almost inaccessible except by boat or air. The only settlements close by / in Fiordland (depending on definition) are Manapouri and Te Anau townships, which together have around 2,100 permanent inhabitants and over 4,000 tourist beds. The Fiordland region receives 1.2 million visitors per year, staying for a combined 1 million visitor nights. The nearest city is Invercargill, about east of southern end of Fiordland. The only major road in Fiordland is State Highway 94, also referred to as Milford Road, connecting Te Anau with Milford Sound. Blanket Bay Hotel, not an actual hotel, may be the westernmost inhabited locality of New Zealand. The fishermen's refuelling and supply depot with a small jetty and helipad is located on a small island at the head of Doubtful Sound / Patea.Blanket Bay Hotel on satellite photo (from Wikimapia website. Accessed 2017-09-14.) Except for electricity generation (at the Manapouri Power Station and a smaller hydro-electric power station at Lake Monowai) and some agriculture, tourism is the only other major economic factor of the region. Visitor spending was NZ$92 million in 2003, and 1,017 people were employed full-time in the tourism industry, with an additional 1,900 people considered to be employed in tourism industry support services.Milford Sound Transport - Issues and Options (GHD Ltd for Venture Southland, 2005) Most tourists visit Milford Sound / Piopiotahi, though walking in the more accessible eastern parts of the alps is a popular activity. Nonetheless, the remoteness of the region limits even tourism, and after short visits to the major sites, most tourists return to other areas, such as Queenstown or Invercargill.

The Vineyard Movement is rooted in the charismatic renewal and historic evangelicalism. Instead of the mainstream charismatic label, however, the movement has preferred the term Empowered Evangelicals (a term coined by Rich Nathan and Ken Wilson in their book of the same name) to reflect their roots in traditional evangelicalism as opposed to classical Pentecostalism. Members also sometimes describe themselves as the \\"radical middle\\" between evangelicals and Pentecostals, which is a reference to the book The Quest for the Radical Middle, a historical survey of the Vineyard by Bill Jackson. It has been associated with the \\"Signs and Wonders\\" movement,Nigel Scotland Charismatics and the New Millennium (Guildford: Eagle, 1995) the Toronto blessing, the Kansas City Prophets and a particular style of Christian worship music. The Vineyard operates a publishing house, Vineyard International Publishing. History The first local church started when Kenn Gulliksen brought together two Bible studies, both meeting at the houses of singer/songwriters: Larry Norman and Chuck Girard in 1974.Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism: Revised and expanded edition, Baylor University Press, USA, 2004, p. 713 In early 1975, thirteen groups met at the Beverly Hills Women's club. These Bible studies, and others like them, were attended by many popular actors/actresses and musicians including Bob Dylan. Gulliksen's Vineyard had spun off sister churches. In 1977, John Wimber, an evangelical pastor and teacher on church growth, founded a Calvary Chapel in Yorba Linda, California. Wimber's teaching on healing and the ministry of the Holy Spirit led to conflict. In a meeting with Calvary Chapel leaders, it was suggested that Wimber's church stop using the Calvary name and affiliate with Gulliksen's Vineyard movement.Jackson, Bill. \\"A Short History of the Association of Vineyard Churches\\" in Church, Identity, and Change: Theology and Denominational Structures in Unsettled Times. David A. Roozen and James R. Nieman, Editors. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2005. . p. 136. In 1982, Wimber's church changed its name to the Anaheim Vineyard Christian Fellowship. Gulliksen turned over the churches under his oversight to Wimber, beginning his leadership of the Vineyard movement. Evangelist Lonnie Frisbee credits Gulliksen as founder of the Vineyard movement. Beginning in 1988, Wimber established relationships with prophetic figures such as Paul Cain, Bob Jones, and Mike Bickle who pastored Kansas City Fellowship, an independent church which would come under the Vineyard banner as Metro Vineyard (see Kansas City Prophets). For a time, these men had considerable influence on Wimber and the Vineyard‚Äîaccording to Jackson, Wimber's son was delivered from drug addiction through a prophetic word from Jones.Jackson (2005), p. 137. However, there were those in the Vineyard who were skeptical, and Wimber himself became disillusioned over the restorationist teaching and failed prophecies of these men. Around 1991, Wimber began to distance himself from the prophetic movement, leading the Vineyard back to a church-planting direction, while Bickle's church withdrew and dropped the Vineyard label. The Vineyard Movement suffered a visible leadership vacuum after Wimber's death on November 16, 1997. However, Todd Hunter, who served as National Coordinator since February 1994 and as acting Director of the Vineyard at the time of Wimber's death, became the National Director in January 1998 and served in that capacity until he resigned in May 2000. After Hunter's resignation, the National Board of Directors named Bert Waggoner of Sugar Land, Texas, as the new National Director. As of 2007, the Association of Vineyard Churches includes over 2400 churches around the world, and this number continues to grow due to a strong priority placed on church- planting within the Vineyard mission. In October, 2011, Phil Strout was selected by the National Board of Directors to succeed Waggoner as National Director in January 2013. Statistics On the union's website, they claim that in 2020 it had 2,400 churches in 95 countries.Association of Vineyard Churches, Our Global Family, vineyardusa.org, USA, retrieved May 30, 2020 Beliefs and practices =Doctrinal statements= For most of the early life of the Vineyard Movement, Vineyard churches had no official statement of faith. This is not to be interpreted as an absence of a common belief structure; rather, the primary reasons for the absence of such a declaration were: * the demonstrative teaching of John Wimber, who effectively set the tone and doctrinal beliefs of the movement * a desire to reflect the \\"low- key,\\" \\"low-pressure\\" environment of the church that encouraged people to \\"come as you are\\" * specifically, de-emphasizing any atmosphere or actions that could be considered overtly dogmatic. According to text in the official Vineyard Statement of Faith released in 1994, an effort to create a common Statement of Faith had been underway since 1983, but took 10+ years to complete because: \\"On one hand, we felt obliged to set forth our biblical and historically orthodox beliefs, on the other hand, we wanted to describe the values and priorities that make the Vineyard unique within the context of Evangelicalism.\\" =LGBTQ+ position= In a 2020 letter to local church leaders, Vineyard Canada expressed its position that having a non-heterosexual orientation is not sinful in and of itself, however the church does not allow the officiating of same sex marriages or licensing people in same sex marriages for pastoral ministry. This letter also distinguished gender identity from sexual orientation as its own theological and policy matter that requires further consideration. Branches =United States= The national headquarters of Vineyard USA is currently located in Sugar Land, Texas. Vineyard USA is divided into eight regions, and each region has clusters of churches grouped together by location, facilitated by an Area Pastoral Care Leader (APCL). The APCL's work together with the Regional Overseer (RO) to provide leadership and encouragement to the region. The central governing body of the Vineyard in the U.S. is known as the Executive Team, and includes the National Director. Currently, the President and National Director is Phil Strout. All major strategic decisions, including theological and doctrinal statements, are made by the National Board. In 2018, Vineyard USA is estimated to have approximately 200,000 members in 600 churches. =United Kingdom and Ireland= =Denmark= As of 2017, 5 new churches have started in Denmark. 3 of these churches within just one year.

The organization uses it to release worship albums. A UK branch of the record label exists, called Vineyard Records. Its musicians include Kathryn Scott, Nigel Briggs, Samuel Lane, Nigel Hemming, Brenton Brown, Brian Doerksen, Andy Park, Jeremy Riddle, Kevin Prosch and Sara Brusco. =History= Vineyard Music was developed by the Vineyard church in 1985. The church began to write its own worship songs, so John Wimber founded Mercy Records. This later became Vineyard Worship. =Discography= * Hungry (1999) The Toronto Blessing and associated criticism During the 1990s, the Vineyard was widely criticized by cessationist Christians due to events during a series of revival meetings at the then Toronto Vineyard. These meetings, dubbed the Toronto Blessing, gained notoriety due to the large crowds, lengthy meetings, and reports of unorderly manifestations of the Holy Spirit, including people laughing, crying, and shaking.Maxwell, Joe (October 24). \\"Laughter Draws Toronto Charismatic Crowds\\". Christianity Today 38 (12). Critics, such as Hank Hanegraaff in his book, \\"Counterfeit Revival\\", charged the Toronto Blessing (under Wimber's authority at the time) with promoting heresy for three main reasons: first, claiming unusual experiences of the Holy Spirit including physical responses, speaking in tongues, and prophesying; second, claiming that these experiences of spiritual revelation were equal in importance to the Bible; and third, claiming that these experiences were a sign that God was doing \\"something new.\\"Hanegraaff, Hank Counterfeit Revival Word Publishing. 1997 Hanegraaff held that the Toronto Blessing (and thus the Vineyard movement) was denying sola scriptura or the ‚Äúsufficiency of Scripture‚Äù, a doctrinal tenet to which the majority of Protestant churches adhere, by suggesting that all believers should come to see what \\"new thing\\" God was doing in Toronto. To cessationist and conservative thinking, this \\"new thing\\" felt dangerous and potentially cultist, putting the inerrant word of God on equal footing with the expression of a spiritual gift or, in the Hanegraaff's position, undermining the Bible with false teachings. Ultimately, the Toronto church was released from the Vineyard movement due to the controversy of how the meetings were being handled.Bowker, John (1997). \\"Toronto Blessing\\".

The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country Hits, p.366. . Early life Hendricks was born in Nashville, Tennessee. A lifetime resident of Nashville, she was surrounded by the influences of early country music and the remaining vestiges of ragtime, particularly through the guitar pickers. She took up piano at age five, and played ragtime, gospel, and country music. Despite her parents' best efforts to encourage a direction towards classical music, the environment in Nashville, plus the early local programming on radio, convinced her that she wanted to play piano in the honky-tonk style. Her dream goal was the Grand Ole Opry, something she would realize in her early 30s. Career Shortening her married name (Adelaide Hazelwood) to something easier to remember (and intentionally non-gender specific), Wood began playing in bands and honky-tonk joints in her 20s. After a decade of building repertoire and reputation, she spent some time as a staff pianist at WLBJ in Bowling Green, Kentucky. It was there that she was heard playing \\"Down Yonder\\" among other pieces, which led to a gig with a recording group called Hugh \\"Baby\\" Jarrett and his Dixieliners. This led to the first of many recording sessions for the Tennessee Records label starting in 1951. \\"Down Yonder\\" soon became a national hit in both the country and pop categories in Billboard record charts, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. She is probably the first female country solo instrumentalist to sell a million copies of a record. This success was turned into appearances on the Grand Ole Opry starting in 1952, which led to an eventual full-time gig there in 1953, fulfilling her long-time dream. Two years later her fame culminated with a contract from RCA Victor Records, where she would make some of the first country/honky-tonk stereo recordings in the late 1950s. While nothing else that she put out had the same success as \\"Down Yonder\\", her offerings over the next decade were frequent and consistent. Wood gained the title, Queen of the Ragtime Pianists, sometimes shared with junior fellow plunker Jo Ann Castle. She was also divorced from her stage-namesake, Carson Hazelwood, during this period, but not before adopting a son they named Wesley. In 1984, Del Wood appeared in the movie Rhinestone, starring Dolly Parton and Sylvester Stallone as the pianist in the Wild Possums Band. = Death = During the Vietnam War, Wood was part of one of the Grand Ole Opry package tours that entertained troops overseas in 1968. Her recordings after the late 1960s were infrequent at best, but her appearances on the Opry continued until just before her death from a stroke on October 3, 1989 at the age of 69. She was interred in the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville.

Interior view of Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph The original St. Joseph's Church was called San Jose de GuadalupeHistory of the Cathedral Basilica of St Joseph built on the site of the current basilica in 1803, and was the first non-mission parish built in California for the benefit of Spanish settlers instead of the Mission Indians (Ohlone). The Pueblo de San Jose de Guadalupe was connected with Mission Santa Clara by The Alameda which was part of the historic El Camino Real. The original adobe structure was damaged by earthquakes in 1818 and 1822, and a new adobe church was built from 1835 to 1846. The second church was severely damaged by the 1868 Hayward earthquake, and work on the third church began in 1869. The third church was destroyed by fire in 1875, and a temporary fourth church was built a few blocks away while the fifth and current church was being constructed. The fifth church was dedicated by Joseph Alemany, Archbishop of San Francisco, in 1877 while construction continued. The current portico was completed in 1884, and the large dome was finished in 1885. In 1981, a major renovation project was begun at the church, which was to become the cathedral for the new Roman Catholic Bishop of San Jose. In 1985, the church was elevated to a cathedral, pending completion of the restoration in 1990. It replaced Saint Patrick Proto-Cathedral Parish, located a few blocks away, as the cathedral of the diocese. The cathedral was made a minor basilica by Pope John Paul II in 1997.

The story centers around Will McLean, who is in his fourth year at the fictional Carolina Military Institute in Charleston, South Carolina. Will‚Äôs experiences are heavily based on Pat Conroy‚Äôs own experiences at The Citadel, a real military college in Charleston. The story is narrated in first person by Will, who attends the Institute between 1963 and 1967. Will recounts his years at the Institute, especially focusing on the school's brutal culture of hazing and abuse. After discovering a secret society that convinces freshmen deemed unworthy of graduating from the Institute to drop out by any means necessary, Will and his friends' graduations and lives are threatened.  Background  Although Conroy drew on his experiences as a cadet at The Citadel, he has said that the story is not based on his life or that of any other graduate of a military academy and is fictionalized. Conroy's novel received criticism from some Citadel alumni who considered its thinly veiled account an unflattering picture of the school and Conroy was ostracized by his alma mater and effectively banned from campus for over 20 years after publishing the novel. In 2001, Conroy was invited back to campus where he gave the commencement address and was given an Honorary Doctorate. Plot Will McLean, returning to the Carolina Military Institute in Charleston, South Carolina an unknown number of years after his graduation, tells the story of his life at the Institute. In 1966, Will was an English major on a basketball scholarship, in his fourth and final year at the Institute. Will is not interested in a military career, and had only attended on account of his father, also an alumnus, whom he made a deathbed promise years ago to attend and eventually wear the ring. He is generally well liked and his professors and peers recognize him for his integrity and fairness, although he is also sarcastic and independent. Will struggles to fit in the strict military environment, but finds solace in his three roommates, who have become his closest friends: Tradd St. Croix, the son of an upper class Charlestonian family and two brawny Italian-American boys from the North, Dante \\"Pig\\" Pignetti and Mark Santoro. They all look forward to graduation, although Will's friends will head off to fight in the Vietnam War, which Will is personally against. However, Will does have some pride in the Institute, representing it in basketball. Though antiwar, he also despises the discrimination the Institute faces from civilian students of other colleges due to its military association, which he sees at away games. In a sidebar, when Will plays a game against the Virginia Military Institute, it is considered the biggest rival game, but also notes VMI was the only team all season that did not harass him and his teammates. Colonel Berrineau, the Commandant of Cadets who is commonly known as The Bear, asks Will to look out for the Institute's first black cadet, Tom Pearce, knowing that Will is the only liberal in the student body. Will also begins a secret relationship with Annie Kate Gervais, a girl from an upper class Charlestonian family who has become pregnant from a boy who refused to marry her, though their relationship is doomed because Will is Irish-American and Catholic. Will attempts to help a freshman, Poteete, who is struggling with the plebe system, the brutal hazing and abuse experienced by freshmen at the Institute, but he kills himself. In an extended flashback, Will then describes his own plebe year three years earlier. Will learns that the only way to survive is to bond closely with the other members of his class against the cadre. Many of Will's classmates quit due to the brutal hazing. However, a recruit named Bobby Bentley, who has a problem with urinating on himself due to the stress of hazing, refuses to quit. Conventional hazing methods fail to break Bentley, causing Will's class to come together, making Will's cadre the subject of ridicule of the entire cadet corps. Near the end of the year, Will's freshman class is recognized as cadets, and the hazing ends. Some time before this, Bobby Bentley is taken off campus and withdraws from the Institute the following day for unknown reasons. Back in Will's senior year, he hears rumors of The Ten, a mysterious Institute secret society that ensures certain cadets, deemed unacceptable to \\"wear the ring\\" (that is, to be a graduate of the Institute, denoted by wearing of a class ring), are run out by any means necessary. Will discovers that the Ten are real and are trying to run Pearce out to keep the Institute all white. Meanwhile, Will and the other seniors are given their Institute rings in preparation for graduation, and Will wins the final basketball game of his career. Annie Kate's baby is stillborn and she rejects Will, wanting to forget all about the time she spent pregnant. Will looks further into the Ten and reunites with Bobby Bentley, who reveals that, during their plebe year, he was spirited away to a house, and was threatened and tortured to the point that he agreed to quit. Bentley says his ultimate decision to quit was not due to the torture, but the realization he no longer wished to be associated with any organization that would have a group like The Ten. Bentley recalls one member of The Ten, whom they piece together as a high-ranking cadet from their plebe year. Will, Mark, Tradd, and Pig, discovering this Ten member is now a student at a nearby law school, abduct him, then interrogate him on a secluded railroad track until he reveals the location of the house, which is located on the property of the president of the Institute, General Bentley Durrell. When Pearce is kidnapped by the Ten, Will goes to the house but is discovered. He is rescued by Mark and Pig, but their identities are now known by the Ten. Pearce is intimidated into silence, and the Ten attempt to have Mark, Pig and Will thrown out of the school. Pig is caught on an honor code violation due to the Ten and loses the honor court case, despite the help of his roommates. After he is drummed out of school, he throws himself in front of a train, killing himself. The Ten then attempt to get Will and Mark kicked out of school for excess demerits. Just as they are about to be thrown out, Will discovers that Tradd's father was a member of the Ten. He and Mark read his journals and discover the names of all current and former members. They also discover that Tradd is a member of the Ten and had been feeding the Ten information the whole time, and that Tradd is the father of Annie Kate's baby. Will confronts Tradd and ends their friendship. Will then blackmails the General with the information on the Ten into letting him and Mark graduate. Durrell refuses, claiming their substandard performance and the fact that the graduate they kidnapped want to press charges against them is justification for dismissal, until The Bear enters the General's office, saying that he has contacted multiple cadets who were run out of the Institute and are now considering lawsuits. General Durrell relents when there is also the threat of exposing this to newspapers, as evidenced by Mark seen outdoors mailing letters. However, the Board of Governors gets Colonel Berrineau removed from his position as commandant. Will and Mark are allowed to graduate, and shortly before this he gets a letter from Annie Kate thanking him for standing by her and that he will make a good husband to whatever woman he finds. As Will graduates, he reflects that eight of his fellow cadets would eventually be killed in action in the Vietnam War, among them Mark. Will also reveals that The Ten member and class \\"golden boy\\" John Alexander would fade into obscurity, last seen working as a ROTC instructor at a small university, while Mark Santoro topped the entire class in awards for valor. As Will receives his diploma from the Institute, he is coldly told by General Durrell not to disgrace the ring, to which Will simply replies with \\"Dante Pignetti\\". The Bear appears at the graduation to congratulate Will. Disgusted at seeing General Durrell's signature on his diploma, Will asks Colonel Berrineau to sign it as Will wants the name of a man he can respect on the diploma. The Bear does not sign, remarking, \\"there already is, Bubba\\", pointing to Will's name.  Characters  *Will McLean ‚Äì The protagonist and narrator, who is heavily based on Pat Conroy himself in his college years. Will is independent and sarcastic, and, unlike the rest of his classmates, does not wish to join the military after graduation. However, he is generally well liked on campus due to his fairness and kindness. He narrates the story some time after his graduation. *Tradd St. Croix ‚Äì Will's roommate and friend, from a very rich and respected old Charlestonian family. Will becomes close to him and his parents, Abigail and Commerce St. Croix. Their friendship ends after Will discovers he was a secret member of the Ten. *Dante \\"Pig\\" Pignetti ‚Äì Will's roommate and friend, and a brawny Italian-American from the North.

Annie Kate struggles with loneliness due to the fact that she must hide herself to hide her pregnancy after her baby's father refused to marry her. Annie Kate ends her relationship with Will after her baby is stillborn. She moves to California to attend college and asks Will to not to contact her, but not before confirming to Will that Tradd was the child's father. *General Bentley Durrell ‚Äì A famous Second World War general and president of the Institute, who turns out to have been a former member of the Ten who is still protecting the organization. *Bobby Bentley ‚Äì A fellow student who, in Will's freshman year, is targeted by upperclassmen due to his wetting himself.

The character was based on Lieutenant Colonel Thomas \\"The Boo\\" Courvoisie, an iconic former Assistant Commandant at The Citadel who was the subject of Conroy's first book. *John \\"Bucky\\" Poteete ‚Äì A freshman who Will tries to help when he struggles under the brutal hazing in the Institute. His suicide after being kidnapped and tortured by the Ten drives Will into a depression.  Reception  The novel received generally positive reviews. Film adaptation The novel was adapted for the screenplay of a 1983 film of the same name, starring David Keith as Will McLean and Robert Prosky as Colonel \\"The Bear\\" Berrineau. The film version took place entirely in McLean's senior year, when he was asked to protect Pearce. Several plot points were changed for the film: * In the novel, Poteete hangs himself after being rescued from the roof by McLean and Santoro before he could jump into his death. In the film, he is bamboozled by other cadets into being declared fit to wear the ring if he attempts a dangerous stunt, jumping from one rooftop to another. When he attempts to do so, Poteete misses and falls. * In the novel, McLean was assigned the duty of protecting Pearce because of McLean's perceived liberalism. In the film, McLean was assigned the duty to repay The Bear for protecting him during his own plebe year. * After his \\"walk of shame\\", Pignetti commits suicide by walking into the path of a speeding train. In the film, he simply gets into a taxicab called for him and is never seen again. The film states that as part of deal with Durrell, Pignetti was to be reinstated at the Institute's next year to earn his incomplete credits. * Tradd's motivation for joining The Ten is not as well explained in the film, and the novel's entire \\"Honey Prince\\" subplot of Tradd's effeminate nature is never depicted, apart from a brief aside by Tradd's father Commerce in the opening. In the film, Tradd admits it was his father also being a member, ensuring him legacy status, and was enthralled with membership in The Ten being the Institute's highest honor, but expresses some remorse over The Ten's activities. * The entire plotline concerning McLean and Annie Kate Gervais, the mother of his roommate Tradd St Croix's illegitimate‚Äîand ultimately stillborn‚Äîchild, is not in the film. * In the film, Pearce apologizes for turning his back on McLean, explaining that he did it because of survival, and if he did not make it, \\"the next nigger has my record around his neck like a rock\\". In the novel, McLean has no further contact with Pearce after that.

By 1965 the population was 3,630, so water was instead pumped from the Waikato and from a deep bore, with a new reservoir and water treatment plant opened in 1965. = 21st century = By April 2001, the damaged rail bridge was mended. In 2008, NgƒÅruawƒÅhia set a world record for the largest haka and by 2010 the town had its own community news. In 2011, murals were installed for NgƒÅruawƒÅhia's 150th anniversary in 2013 Ngaruawahia High School (which opened in 1963) celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013. In May 2016, Heather du Plessis-Allan (an NZME broadcaster) claimed that the \\"town is rotting\\". The broadcaster later accepted a challenge to visit the town and an article relating to the incident appeared on a Waikato Times front page.'Epic front page' prompts Heather du Plessis-Allan visit to Ngaruawahia According to Waikato District Mayor Allan Sanson, du Plessis-Allan \\"really upset locals\\".'Rotting' Ngaruawahia hits back at Heather du Plessis-Allan In June 2016, local mayor Allan Sanson said du Plessis-Allan spent around three hours in the town, apologizing to residents. Retrieved October 2016 In 2019, the name of the town was officially gazetted as NgƒÅruawƒÅhia. Infrastructure = Waikato River crossings = 1875 punt, with Waikato Steam Navigation Company flour mill, paddle steamers Waipa and Bluenose and Hakarimata Range in the background Until the Waikato invasion the rivers were the main transport routes, but, after the Great South Road and main trunk line were built, the rivers became barriers, which needed crossings. As early as 1870 a public meeting called for a bridge, but a punt continued to be the main means of crossing the river until the road-rail bridge opened for traffic in 1876. So long as there were few trains, there was little complaint that gates closed 10 minutes before a train was due. However, by the 1900s road and rail traffic was increasing, averaging 20 trains, 275 pedestrians, 43 equestrians, 29 light vehicles, 18 milk carts, 6 wagons, and 55 stock a day in 1910.  1921 single-lane road bridge  A survey for a road bridge was done in 1911. Test borings for piles were done in 1912. The NgƒÅruawƒÅhia Town Board and Waikato, Waipa, and Raglan County Councils agreed to share the cost in 1914. The State Advances office lent ¬£2,500 for the bridge in 1915. Wartime shortages caused further delays, but by 1917 the new bridge was taking shape. Further delay occurred when additional piles had to be driven. The Minister reported the work well in hand in 1919, but then a temporary bridge, used in construction, was hit by a steamer. Work got under way again, ¬£3,000 was in the Public Works Estimates and the bridge was reported complete in 1920, except for its approaches. The bridge opened in 1921 and, on 28 July 1921, was officially opened by the Minister of Public Works, J. G. Coates. It was wide and long, made up of 3 x , a and a span. Two piers were in the river on concrete cylinders sunk below normal water-level. The others were reinforced concrete on concrete piling and the deck and trusses of Australian hardwood. Complaints had been made about a single-lane bridge since before it was built, so, when the new NIMT bridge was built, the Main Highways Board leased the old one and added decking. The conversion was completed in early November 1931, allowing 2-way traffic. Single lane traffic was reinstated for a few months in 1936 to allow a truss on the 1921 bridge to be replaced. Traffic was still increasing. In 1935 traffic between Ohinewai and NgƒÅruawƒÅhia averaged 660 vehicles a day. By 1938 it had risen to 1,329.  1956 bridge  On 13 March 1953 a contract was let for a new steel truss bridge. An April 1955 photo shows two piers in the river. On 20 August 1955 the centre span was placed and a 1955 photo shows the bridge almost finished. The first car drove over the bridge on 19 October 1956. By 2008 17,392 vehicles a day were crossing the bridge. No more recent counts have been published, but, after the opening of the Taupiri link in 2013, traffic on the Great South Rd in NgƒÅruawƒÅhia, was 12,467 in 2015, suggesting that traffic on the bridge has been reduced by about 5,000 vehicles a day. = Listed buildings = NgƒÅruawƒÅhia's history is reflected in the number of its Listed Buildings ‚Äì Category 1 Turangawaewae House built in 1912‚Äì1919 as Te Kauhanganui building in a fusion of Arts and Crafts and traditional MƒÅori styles; Category 2 ‚Äì Band Rotunda, Delta Tavern, Doctor's House, former bakery, former Flourmill Store, former MƒÅori pƒÅ ‚Äì Puke i Ahua, Grant's Chambers, 13 Lower Waikato Esplanade, 2 Old Taupiri Rd, Pioneer Gun Turret, Riverdale, St Paul's Church, War Memorial.

Retrieved October 2016 The first MƒÅori King, P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero, was crowned at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia in 1858 and was living there when he died two years later. The current MƒÅori King is T≈´heitia Paki; he obtained the throne at T≈´rangawaewae Marae immediately following his mother's passing in 2006. =Marae= NgƒÅruawƒÅhia has two marae affiliated with the Waikato Tainui hap≈´ of NgƒÅti Mahuta and NgƒÅti Te Weehi: T≈´rangawaewae and its Mahinaarangi or Turongo meeting house, and Waikeri-Tangirau Marae. =Tribal Huk= A local gang is Tribal Huk, who have been seen as heroes by the community for providing lunches to schoolchildren in NgƒÅruawƒÅhia, Hamilton and Huntly. In particular, they have been known for making sandwiches, which earned them the nickname \\"Sandwich Gang\\". In October 2016, Tribal Huk president Jamie Pink started a movement against methamphetamine, known in New Zealand as \\"P\\". Waikato District Mayor Allan Sanson supported Pink's message to NgƒÅruawƒÅhia methamphetamine dealers to either leave the town within 24 hours or \\"visits\\" would begin. The demand was also supported by members of the community who had gathered at a local meeting. According to a gang source, NgƒÅruawƒÅhia became P free, but the Police Association stated that there was no evidence that P dealers had left NgƒÅruawƒÅhia. There is additionally concern Pink has damaged the work that Tribal Huk did feeding a thousand Waikato schoolchildren. In November 2016, another community meeting was held. Pink was not present. = Christianity = In the 1996 census, the majority of residents identified as Christian. A Bible is traditionally used during the crowning of a MƒÅori monarch. In 1995, the Holy Trinity Anglican Church burned down, and a new church had been built in its place by 1998. On the northern side of the Waipa River is the Christian Youth Camps (CYC), the largest youth camp site in New Zealand. CYC started in the early 1960s with large Easter conventions. Today there are two separate camp sites on 38 hectares of land. The camp offers school holiday camps throughout the year. During the terms, the camps are used by various groups, including schools, churches and sporting organisations. =Sport and recreation= Football (soccer) Ngaruawahia United, known as \\"The Green Machine\\", is the local football (soccer) club, founded in 1968. Centennial Park serves as the home ground for the club, and has been the home venue for ASB Premiership side Waikato FC in past seasons. Rugby league The town's rugby league teams are Ngaruawahia Panthers and T≈´rangawaewae. The 'Ngaruawahia Rugby League Club' is the oldest such club in the Waikato. Early games were played on varying venues, for instance Taupiri paddock and Paterson Park. The first major match for the town was held in August 1911 when they lost to Auckland 22 ‚Äì 36 at the Caledonian Ground in Frankton. Ngaruawahia did however beat Hamilton United 27 ‚Äì 4 in the first ever Northern Union game to be played at Hamilton's Steele Park in 1912.

'Ngaruawahia Rugby League Club' (Panthers) are 2011 champions, Premiers, U17, U14, U13 are all champions.  River activities  The local regatta has been a fundamental event for the region for well over a century. An event is held every year in March on the Waikato River. The first regatta was an unofficial event in 1892, involving both MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ festivities. The regatta provided a means of association between two ethnic groups, socially and culturally. The first official regatta took place in 1896 and since then has grown to become one of New Zealand's largest aquatic festivals.The Regatta During the centennial regatta in March 1996, over 48,000 people visited the town to see thousands of performers from a number of countries. For many years, jumping off the rail bridge has been a tradition. However, organisations such as KiwiRail want the practice to end. Retrieved November 2016  Hopuhopu  Hopuhopu is north of NgƒÅruawƒÅhia. From 1853 Hopuhopu had a boys' mission school, which lost most of its pupils in 1862 and, by 1863, was reported as in disrepair. The mission house burnt down in 1886. An army camp was built on the mission site in the 1920s, including its own water supply, ammunition dumps and a railway siding. A 1925 photograph showed only one building and many tents, but a 1955 aerial photo showed the extent of building, which was largely complete by 1927. In 1993 the camp was returned to Waikato-Tainui, who converted it to their headquarters and Waikato-Tainui College for Research and Development.

The president was a member of Congress elected by the other delegates to serve as a neutral discussion moderator during meetings of Congress. Designed to be a largely ceremonial position without much influence, the office was unrelated to the later office of President of the United States., p. 1. Upon the ratification of the Articles of Confederation (the new nation's first constitution) in March 1781, the Continental Congress became the Congress of the Confederation. The membership of the Second Continental Congress carried over without interruption to the First Congress of the Confederation, as did the office of president. Fourteen men served as president of Congress between September 1774 and November 1788. They came from 9 of the original 13 states: Virginia (3), Massachusetts (2), Pennsylvania (2), South Carolina (2), Connecticut (1), Delaware (1), Maryland (1), New Jersey (1), and New York (1). The median age at the time of election was 47., p. 101. Role The president of Congress was, by design, a position with little authority., p. 71. The Continental Congress, fearful of concentrating political power in an individual, gave their presiding officer even less responsibility than the speakers in the lower houses of the colonial assemblies., pp. 71‚Äì73. Unlike some colonial speakers, the president of Congress could not, for example, set the legislative agenda or make committee appointments., pp. 75, 89. The president could not meet privately with foreign leaders; such meetings were held with committees or the entire Congress., pp. 77‚Äì78. The presidency was a largely ceremonial position.Gregory A. Stiverson, \\"Hanson, John, Jr.\\", American National Biography Online, February 2000.H. James Henderson. \\"Boudinot, Elias\\", American National Biography Online, February 2000. There was no salary., 13. The primary role of the office was to preside over meetings of Congress, which entailed serving as an impartial moderator during debates., pp. 76, 82. When Congress would resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole to discuss important matters, the president would relinquish his chair to the chairman of the Committee of the Whole., p. 81. Even so, the fact that President Thomas McKean was at the same time serving as Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, provoked some criticism that he had become too powerful. According to historian Jennings Sanders, McKean's critics were ignorant of the powerlessness of the office of president of Congress., pp. 21‚Äì22. The president was also responsible for dealing with a large amount of official correspondence,, p. 76. but he could not answer any letter without being instructed to do so by Congress., p. 80. Presidents also signed, but did not write, Congress's official documents., p. 78. These limitations could be frustrating, because a delegate essentially declined in influence when he was elected president., p. 89. Historian Richard B. Morris argued that, despite the ceremonial role, some presidents were able to wield some influence: Congress, and its presidency, declined in importance after the ratification of the Articles of Confederation and the ending of the Revolutionary War. Increasingly, delegates elected to the Congress declined to serve, the leading men in each state preferred to serve in state government, and the Congress had difficulty establishing a quorum., pp. 85‚Äì88. President Hanson wanted to resign after only a week in office, but Congress lacked a quorum to select a successor, and so he stayed on. President Mifflin found it difficult to convince the states to send enough delegates to Congress to ratify the 1783 Treaty of Paris.John K. Alexander, \\"Mifflin, Thomas\\", American National Biography Online, February 2000. For six weeks in 1784, President Lee did not come to Congress, but instead instructed secretary Charles Thomson to forward any papers that needed his signature., p. 87. John Hancock was elected to a second term in November 1785, even though he was not then in Congress, and Congress was aware that he was unlikely to attend. He never took his seat, citing poor health, though he may have been uninterested in the position., p. 88. Two delegates, David Ramsay and Nathaniel Gorham, performed his duties with the title of \\"chairman\\"., p. 29. When Hancock finally resigned the office in June 1786, Gorham was elected. After he resigned in November 1786, it was months before enough members were present in Congress to elect a new president. In February 1787, General Arthur St. Clair was elected. Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance during St. Clair's presidency and elected him as the governor of the Northwest Territory., pp. 30‚Äì31. As the people of the various states began debating the proposed United States Constitution in later months of 1787, the Confederation Congress found itself reduced to the status of a caretaker government. There were not enough delegates present to choose St. Clair's successor until January 22, 1788, when the final president of Congress, Cyrus Griffin, was elected. Griffin resigned his office on November 15, 1788, after only two delegates showed up for the new session of Congress. Term of office Prior to ratification of the Articles, presidents of Congress served terms of no specific duration; their tenure ended when they resigned, or, lacking an official resignation, when Congress selected a successor. When Peyton Randolph, who was elected in September 1774 to preside over the First Continental Congress, was unable to attend the last few days of the session due to poor health, Henry Middleton was elected to replace him., p. 11. When the Second Continental Congress convened the following May, Randolph was again chosen as president, but he returned to Virginia two weeks later to preside over the House of Burgesses., pp. 11‚Äì12. John Hancock was elected to fill the vacancy, but his position was somewhat ambiguous, because it was not clear if Randolph had resigned or was on a leave of absence., p. 191. The situation became uncomfortable when Randolph returned to Congress in September 1775. Some delegates thought Hancock should have stepped down, but he did not; the matter was resolved only by Randolph's sudden death that October., p. 199. Ambiguity also clouded the end of Hancock's term. He left in October 1777 for what he believed was an extended leave of absence, only to find upon his return that Congress had elected Henry Laurens to replace him., p. 230‚Äì31. Hancock, whose term ran from May 24, 1775 to October 29, 1777 (a period of ), was the longest serving president of Congress. The length of a presidential term was ultimately codified by Article Nine of the Articles of Confederation, which authorized Congress \\"to appoint one of their number to preside; provided that no person be allowed to serve in the office of president more than one year in any term of three years\\". When the Articles went into effect in March 1781, however, the Continental Congress did not hold an election for a new president under the new constitution., 503. Instead, Samuel Huntington continued serving a term that had already exceeded the new Term limit. The first president to serve the specified one-year term was John Hanson (November 5, 1781 to November 4, 1782)., p. 524. List of presidents Terms and backgrounds of the 14 men who served as president of the Continental Congress:, p. 77. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - ! class = \\"unsortable\\" ! Name ! State/colony ! Term ! Length ! class = \\"unsortable\\"Previous position } Relationship to the president of the United States Beyond a similarity of title, the office of President of Congress \\"bore no relationship\\" to the later office of President of the United States. As historian Edmund Burnett wrote: Nonetheless, the presidents of the Continental Congress and the presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled are sometimes claimed to have been president before Washington as if the offices were indeed equivalent (e.g. ). The continuous nature of the Continental Congresses and Congress under the Articles also allows for multiple claims of being the \\"first president of the United States.\\" This would include Peyton Randolph as president of the First Continental Congress, John Hancock as president when the Declaration was signed, Samuel Huntington as president when the Articles were ratified and took effect, Thomas McKean as the first president elected under the Articles, and John Hanson as the first president under the Articles to serve the prescribed one-year term. Hanson's grandson's campaign to name Hanson the \\"first president of the United States\\" was successful in having Hanson's statue placed in Statuary Hall in the US Capitol, even though, according to historian Gregory Stiverson, Hanson was not one of Maryland's foremost leaders of the Revolutionary era. Presumably due to this campaign, Hanson is often still dubiously listed as the first president of Congress under the Articles. Seal thumb Shortly after the creation of the first die for the Great Seal of the United States, the Congress of the Confederation ordered a smaller seal for the use of the President of the Congress. It was a small oval, with the crest from the Great Seal (the radiant constellation of thirteen stars surrounded by clouds) in the center, with the motto E Pluribus Unum above it. Benson Lossing claimed it was used by all the Presidents of the Congress after 1782, probably to seal envelopes on correspondence sent to the Congress, though only examples from Thomas Mifflin are documented. This seal's use apparently did not pass over to the new government in 1789. Today's Seal of the President of the United States, which developed by custom over a long period before being defined in law, is a more full-featured version of the Great Seal.

Part of the anarcho-punk movement, the band members were committed political anarchists. Their name critiques fervor for then- presidential frontrunner Ronald Reagan with the Hitler Youth who pledged blind allegiance to the Nazi regime during World War II. Their initial career lasted until 1990, and singer Rubinstein committed suicide three years later following a series of tragic events. In 2006, Bakija reformed the band with bassist Al Pike, drummer Javier Madriaga, and several new members. An important group in the New York hardcore scene, they performed regularly at CBGB and toured the U.S. extensively, often with other early punk bands such as the Dead Kennedys, Bad Brains, The Misfits and the Beastie Boys. History =Initial career (1980‚Äì1990)= Rubinstein and Bakija attended Forest Hills High School, the same as that of the Ramones, when they formed their band. After rehearsals under the name Pus with a varying rhythm section, the group changed its name to Reagan Youth shortly before playing its first gig on August 22, 1980, with bassist Andy Bryan (Andy Apathy) and drummer Charlie Bonet (Charlie Tripper). Reagan Youth quickly gained a following and were soon playing the punk clubs of Manhattan. Bakija's physics teacher shaved his head at CBGB's one night and after that became associated with the band, hauling equipment in his Dodge Dart. After the band recorded a four-song demo in 1981, Bryan was replaced by Al Pike. Bonet departed soon after; after the band briefly rehearsed with Rubinstein filling in on drums, Steve Weissman joined full-time. They signed to the R Radical imprint. After graduation and the release of their first record, the seven-song Youth Anthems for the New Order EP, they began touring nationally and were regulars at the Sunday afternoon hardcore matinee shows at CBGB. In 1984, prior to a significant US tour, Pike and Weissman left the group, with Pike going on to join a formative version of Glenn Danzig's group Samhain briefly around this time. They were replaced by Victor Dominicis (Vic Venom) and Rick Griffith (Rick Royale) respectively. Griffith was later replaced in 1985 by Javier Madriaga (Johnny Aztec), who has also played drums in Lujuria, A.P.P.L.E., and Heart Attack. By the late 1980s the extensive touring had taken its toll on the group. Despite the many shows played and the relatively large album sales for a hardcore punk band, they continually found themselves broke. When Ronald Reagan left office in 1989, the band split up. Despite their decision to disband, the group attracted the attention of the burgeoning punk label New Red Archives, with whom they signed a two-album deal. New Red Archives first re-released Youth Anthems for the New World Order with three additional outtakes as the Volume 1 LP. In 1990, Bakija (playing both guitar and bass), Madriaga, and Rubinstein recorded a final album, Volume 2. =Post-breakup (1990‚Äì2006)= Dominicis went on to play guitar in Nausea while Bakija, Madriaga, and Rubinstein continued making music together, briefly performing in a psychedelic rock group called House of God that was derailed by Rubinstein's increasing drug and health problems. House of God recorded a 7-song demo, an unmixed version of which can be found online. By 1990 Rubinstein had become a heroin user and occasional dealer. In a conflict with another dealer, he was severely beaten with a baseball bat, requiring weeks of hospitalization. In 1993 he began dating Tiffany Bresciani, who supported both of their drug habits by prostitution. This same year, Rubinstein's mother was killed in a car accident. Soon after, he and Bresciani were on Houston Street looking for customers and drugs. A familiar customer in a truck hired Bresciani and the two of them disappeared. A few days later, police on Long Island stopped the same truck and discovered Bresciani's slain body in the back. The driver was Joel Rifkin, later convicted as a serial killer responsible for the murder of several prostitutes. Despondent over his continuing drug addiction and the loss of his girlfriend and mother, Rubinstein committed suicide shortly thereafter. This same year, New Red Archives issued A Collection of Pop Classics, which collected both Volume 1 and Volume 2 on a single CD. In 1998, New Red Archives released Live & Rare, a CD compiling highlights from New York City-area Reagan Youth sets from the early '80s with the Pike/Weissman lineup, along with tracks from the band's initial demo and a brief demo for Volume 2. Pike and New Red Archives owner Nicky Garratt, also the guitarist for the British band the UK Subs, contributed liner notes for this release. In 2002, plans for a reunion set at CBGB featuring Bakija,Bryan and Bonet were shattered by Bryan's sudden, fatal heart attack. In the years following, Bakija played a few live sets of Reagan Youth material with other musicians. =Reformation (2006‚Äìpresent)= Reagan Youth Performing at the Bowery Electric on May 26 2017 In 2006, Reagan Youth officially reformed around Bakija, Pike, Madriaga, and new vocalist Pat McGowen (Pat SpEd). They initially intended only to play a single show but opted to continue after the project \\"took on a life of its own.\\"Reagan Youth official web site, History page They played several additional local and regional tours, and embarked on the \\"Resurrection Tour\\" in August 2007 with Boston hardcore band Mouth Sewn Shut. The band began expressing interest in writing and recording a third record, and suggested that it would be about the life and times of Dave Insurgent. The band continued to tour extensively, including their first shows in Germany and Belgium in 2008 and a European tour in 2009. In early 2010 McGowen left and after a year of inactivity the band resumed performed live in late 2010 with new singer Kenny Young, with drummer Mike Sabatino replacing Madriaga. Bassist Dave Manzullo replaced Pike shortly thereafter due to Pike's health concerns. They released the new recording \\"Lucky 7\\" through free Internet outlets in 2011. But Young's drug addiction led to his replacement by Jim \\"Diesel\\" Pepe for the 2011 West Coast tour and two short New England tours in 2012. Pepe saved the band from further dysfunction by learning a full slate of material in days, stepping down in late 2012 to pursue other projects. Paul Rye stepped in for the band's 'Drivin' South Tour' in October 2012. A permanent lead singer was found during that tour, the band's drum technician Trey Oswald. The final piece to the band's puzzle was drummer Stig Whisper replacing Sabatino, allowing Reagan Youth to have a final, definitive lineup for the reformation years. In 2013, Reagan Youth toured with Trey Oswald on vocals, Tibbie X on bass, Stig Whisper on drums, and Paul Cripple, who continues working on one last album about the life and times of Dave Insurgent as the band continues to play at venues everywhere. In March 2015, Reagan Youth announced a west coast mini-tour with Rick Contreras (ex-Dr. Know) on drums and Jeff Penalty (ex-Dead Kennedys) on vocals. Jeff Penalty was then replaced for the same tour by A.J. Delinquent (DeFeo) guitarist in Philadelphia Punk Band GASH, for whom Tibbie X is the lead vocalist. Music =Lyrical content= Reagan Youth is an aggressively anarchist, socialist, and anti-racist band, and often utilized Ku Klux Klan and Nazi Party imagery for satirical effect. In their original 1980s incarnation, they sought to address the parallels between the policies of Ronald Reagan, the Christian Right and American conservatism, and the beliefs of the hate groups. Their eponymous song, \\"Reagan Youth\\", uses a tongue-in-cheek rhetoric to draw parallels between Young Republicans who rallied to the cause of Ronald Reagan, and the Hitler Youth during the Third Reich, ushering in an era of songs about Ronald Reagan in American punk music. The band expressed its left-wing politics through irony, using images from hate groups for their album/CD covers. =Musical style= Musically, the band was firmly rooted in the early hardcore/punk crossover tradition, but moved deeper into waters uncharted by their punk rock contemporaries as their career progressed. While their 1983 debut is an accomplished work squarely in keeping with hardcore punk convention, their 1990 followup features dense guitar work replete with solos and overdubs, diversified tempos and several sonic experiments, leading it to draw comparisons to Black Sabbath and 1970s album-oriented rock.

It was the final Sonic the Hedgehog game for the Dreamcast after Sega discontinued the console. It features two good-vs-evil stories: Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles \\"Tails\\" Prower and Knuckles the Echidna attempt to save the world, while Shadow the Hedgehog, Doctor Eggman and Rouge the Bat attempt to conquer it. The stories are divided into three gameplay styles: fast-paced platforming for Sonic and Shadow, multi-directional shooting for Tails and Eggman, and action-exploration for Knuckles and Rouge. Development began soon after the American release of Sonic Adventure in 1999 and lasted 18 months. The game was produced in commemoration of the Sonic series' tenth anniversary and was designed to be faster-paced and more action-oriented than the original. The development team also expanded upon the presence of the Chao creatures and other player characters. Its locations were influenced by American locations such as San Francisco and Yosemite National Park. Sega announced Sonic Adventure 2 in October 1999 and exhibited it at E3 2000. It was released worldwide on June 23, 2001. Sonic Adventure 2 received generally positive reviews for its gameplay variety, visuals, and audio, though some criticized its camera, voice acting, and plot. An enhanced port for the GameCube, Sonic Adventure 2: Battle, was released worldwide in 2002; this version features improved textures and multiplayer options. Sonic Adventure 2 was also released as a download for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows in 2012. Gameplay Sonic rides a flap from the helicopter and performs tricks in City Escape, the first level of the Hero story in Sonic Adventure 2 Sonic Adventure 2 is a 3D platform game divided into two campaigns: Hero and Dark. In the Hero campaign, players control Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, who fight to save the world; in the Dark campaign, players control Shadow the Hedgehog, Doctor Eggman and Rouge the Bat, fighting to conquer it. Each campaign cycles through levels of its three characters, telling different sides of the story. Levels have a variety of themes (such as cities, jungles, desert pyramids and outer space), with some followed by boss fights. The two campaigns' stories occur in parallel; completing both campaigns unlocks a Last Story with all six characters, culminating in a final boss fight. Sonic and Shadow play fast- paced levels, emphasizing platforming. Their homing attack can lock onto robots created by Eggman and G.U.N., and they can grind on rails. Tails' and Eggman's levels are slower and oriented towards multi-directional shooting; they are confined to mechs in which they can jump short heights, hover and shoot enemies. Knuckles' and Rouge's levels are open and feature action- adventure gameplay with treasure hunting; in each level, they must find three shards of the Master Emerald. Their search is guided by radar and puzzle-based clues from harmless robots. Knuckles and Rouge can glide, defeat enemies with punches and kicks and scale walls, digging into them to find power-ups.Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast) instruction manual, pp. 12‚Äì13. (PDF) Adventure 2 has the health system found in many other Sonic games. The player collects rings scattered throughout the levels; being hit by an enemy while holding rings causes the player to drop them all, while being hit without rings causes them to lose a life. Tails and Eggman have the customary health bar, which is slowly refilled by collecting rings. Dying with no lives results in a game over screen.Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast) instruction manual, p. 19. The characters can obtain permanent upgrades that grant them new abilities; for example, one allows Sonic and Shadow to dash along a sequential trail of rings to reach distant platforms, while another lets Knuckles and Rouge attack powerfully enough to break certain containers.Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast) instruction manual, p. 21. Chaos Drives can be used with the player's Chao (small, anthropomorphic animals).Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast) instruction manual, p. 28. Separate from the main campaigns, the player can raise Chao as virtual pets. They have five attributes (Swim, Fly, Run, Power and Stamina) and a moral continuum from Hero to Dark. From the moment they hatch their stats can be increased with Chaos Drives or small animals, empowering them to compete in karate and racing minigames. Their alignment gradually changes, based on their affection for a characters; for example, a Chao which likes Tails will gradually become more heroic. Playing with Chao increases affection, and when a Chao becomes fully Hero or Dark it assumes that form permanently. Although Chao eventually die, if they received enough affection during their lives they reincarnate. Adventure 2 has 180 emblems, earned for a variety of tasks.Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast) instruction manual, p. 26. Each level has five missions; only the first is required to continue the campaign, and other missions include completing a harder version of a level and collecting 100 rings. The player earns emblems by completing missions and other tasks, many related to Chao raising. Collecting all the emblems unlocks a 3D version of the Green Hill Zone stage from the original Sonic the Hedgehog. The game has several two-player modes. Players may race on foot through new (or altered) levels, have shoot-'em-up battles in mechs, hunt for Master Emerald shardsSonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast) instruction manual, p. 23. or race in go-karts. A few characters are playable in these modes, but not in the main game; Tikal and Chaos from the original Sonic Adventure are playable in the treasure-hunting game,Sonic Adventure 2: Battle (GameCube) instruction manual, pp. 22-23. (PDF) as are Amy Rose and Metal Sonic in the foot-racing levelsSonic Adventure 2: Battle (GameCube) instruction manual, pp. 18-19. and mechs piloted by Chao and Big the Cat in the shooting levels.Sonic Adventure 2: Battle (GameCube) instruction manual, pp. 20-21. Plot Learning of a secret weapon from the diary of his deceased grandfather, Professor Gerald Robotnik, Eggman infiltrates a high-security G.U.N. facility and revives it using a Chaos Emerald.Dark Story, Level 1: Iron Gate The weapon ‚Äì a black hedgehog and self-proclaimed \\"Ultimate Life Form\\" named Shadow ‚Äì offers to help Eggman conquer the world, telling him to rendezvous at an abandoned space colony, ARK, with more Chaos Emeralds. Shadow goes to Central City, encountering G.U.N.'s forces after stealing an Emerald. Shadow has vowed to fulfill a promise to a girl, Maria, which he interprets as one of revenge.Dark Story, Level 4: Radical Highway Shadow blasts through the military force and meets Sonic. After a brief confrontation, Shadow escapes and G.U.N. captures Sonic, whom they mistake for Shadow. Meanwhile, Knuckles encounters Rouge and Eggman, who try to steal the Master Emerald. He stops them by shattering the Emerald and searches for the scattered shards.Hero Story, Level 2: Wild Canyon Rouge, spying for the government, heads to Eggman's base and the ARK.Dark Story, Level 5: Egg Quarters There, Shadow shows Eggman the Eclipse Cannon, another superweapon created by Gerald, and discloses his plan: to charge the cannon with Chaos Emeralds and use it to take over the world. Rouge appears, offering them a Chaos Emerald to gain their trust. Tails and Amy infiltrate G.U.N.'s island base and rescue Sonic,Hero Story, Level 3: Prison Lane while Eggman, Shadow and Rouge collect three Emeralds on the island.Dark Story, Level 7: Weapons BedDark Story, Level 8: Security HallDark Story, Level 9: White Jungle Eggman makes a global broadcast threatening to fire on the Earth in 24 hours if his demands are not met, demonstrating the cannon's power by using it to destroy half the Moon. Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Knuckles use a Chaos Emerald in their possession to track down the other six. They infiltrate Eggman's base,Hero Story, Levels 10: Hidden Base, 11: Pyramid Cave, and 12: Death Chamber boarding his shuttle shortly before it launches into space. Knuckles' Master Emerald shards are spilled along the way, and he leaves to collect them.Hero Story, Level 14: Meteor Herd He fights Rouge again, but when he saves her from falling into a lava pit, she relinquishes her shards and he restores the Master Emerald. On the ARK, Tails reveals he has designed a counterfeit Chaos Emerald to destroy the Eclipse Cannon. As Sonic is about to use it, Eggman tells him that he has captured Tails and Amy, forcing him to return and rescue them.Hero Story, Level 15: Crazy Gadget and Dark Story, Level 13: Cosmic Wall Sonic tries to trick Eggman with the fake Emerald, but Eggman jettisons him in an escape pod rigged with explosives. Tails, thinking Sonic is dead, defeats Eggman. Sonic uses the power of the fake Emerald to escape;Hero Story, Level 16: Final Rush Shadow is sent to intercept him, but Sonic defeats him and destroys the Eclipse Cannon.Dark Story, Level 14: Final Chase Eggman sneaks away from Tails and Amy with the last Emerald and arms the Eclipse Cannon. The entire colony suddenly starts falling and a prerecorded message from Gerald is broadcast globally: he programmed the ARK to collide with Earth if the Emeralds were used, destroying it in revenge for the government condemning his research and killing his colleagues, including his granddaughter Maria. Everyone works together to access the cannon's core and neutralize the ARK using the Master Emerald.Last Story: Cannon's Core When Shadow refuses to participate, Amy pleads for his help, allowing him to remember what Maria really requested of Shadow: for him to help mankind. Shadow catches up with Sonic and Knuckles in the core as they encounter the Biolizard, a prototype Ultimate Life Form. Shadow repels it, allowing Knuckles to deactivate the Chaos Emeralds with the Master Emerald. The Biolizard uses Chaos Control to fuse with the cannon, becoming the Finalhazard and continuing the ARK's collision course. Sonic and Shadow use the Emeralds to transform into their super forms, defeating the Finalhazard and using Chaos Control to teleport the ARK back into stable orbit. This depletes Shadow's energy and he plummets to Earth, content in fulfilling his promise to Maria. The people on Earth celebrate as the heroes return home and Sonic bids Shadow farewell. Development Sonic Adventure 2 was developed by Sonic Team USA, a former American division of Sonic Team, and published by Sega. The game was directed and produced by longtime series contributors Takashi Iizuka and Yuji Naka, respectively, and was developed over an 18-month period beginning shortly after the release of the American version of Sonic Adventure. It was designed to be more action-oriented than the slower-paced, more story-based Adventure. The development team ran the game at 60 frames per second with \\"tempo\\", giving Sonic a variety of actions rather than focusing on speed alone. Its levels facilitated this flow, making Sonic seem faster than he was. For the game's levels and environments the developers were inspired by San Francisco (their headquarters) and other American locations, such as Yosemite National Park (where they vacationed during its development) and the San Francisco Bay Area. Compared to Adventure, the sequel was intended to have \\"more of an American flavor\\". Although the game's level design prioritized the frame rate, it was more streamlined than Adventure because of the team's experience with Dreamcast hardware. Whereas Sonic Team tried to include as much content as possible in Sonic Adventure, in the sequel, they only concentrated on the elements they deemed necessary. Naka said Sonic Adventure 2 was also easier to develop, as Sonic Team had gotten to a point where they could \\"tap the full power of the console and deliver a much better experience to users.\\" Iizuka described the Chao as a \\"relative neutral entity\\" in Sonic Adventure. In the sequel the developers expanded the creatures' presence, adding the ability to raise \\"Hero\\" and \\"Dark\\" Chao to reflect the conflict between good and evil. For the same reason, all six playable characters have roughly equal gameplay time (unlike Adventure, where Big the Cat's and E-102 Gamma's stories were short). In Adventure 2 Chao have the ability to socialize, so they resemble a \\"real artificial life form.\\" Sega announced a follow-up to Sonic Adventure and a spinoff (which would become Sonic Shuffle) on October 4, 1999. The newly named Sonic Adventure 2 appeared at E3 2000, with Sonic Team adding video shown there to its website on June 30. Sonic Team posted a trailer and a number of screenshots on May 30, 2001, with Sega promoting Sonic Adventure 2 as the last Sonic game for the Dreamcast and as marking the series' 10th anniversary. Sega held a 10th-anniversary party for Sonic in June 2001, at which attendees could compete in a battle tournament; the winner played against Iizuka. =Music= As with Sonic Adventure, Jun Senoue served as sound director and lead composer. Additional music was contributed by Fumie Kumatani, Tomoya Ohtani, and Kenichi Tokoi. The soundtrack is primarily melodic rock, with some hip-hop and orchestral tracks. As in Adventure, each character has a musical theme. The game features performances by returning vocalists Tony Harnell, Ted Poley, Marlon Saunders, Nikki Gregoroff and Johnny Gioeli, and new vocalists Tabitha Fair, Todd Cooper, Paul Shortino, Everett Bradley , Kaz Silver and Hunnid-P. Crush 40 (consisting of Senoue and Gioeli) debuted on the game's main theme, \\"Live & Learn\\". Production of the music lasted from April 2000 to February 2001; after this Senoue, along with others, created sound effects. The team wanted Sonic Adventure 2 audio to stand out, rather than merely serving as background music. Senoue felt that some of Sonic Adventure tracks were not as memorable as others. He and the Wave Master musicians made a pact with them \\"to write songs that promoted the game's speed and situations while keeping the best tempo of the stage\\". Senoue wrote each track before producing a demo version and then mixed them with a Yamaha digital console and Mackie analog mixer. He edited tracks using a Macintosh. After Sonic Team approved the music, Senoue finished sequencing it and sent it to the other musicians for production. Several soundtrack albums for the game were released. Sonic Adventure 2 Multi-Dimensional Original Soundtrack was released in Japan by Marvelous Entertainment on September 5, 2001. Sonic Adventure 2 Vocals Collection: Cuts Unleashed, an album with character theme tracks by Senoue and Tokoi, was released by MMV in Japan on August 21, 2001. For the twentieth anniversary of the Sonic series, Sonic Adventure 2 Original Soundtrack 20th Anniversary Edition was released on iTunes on June 22, 2011. On October 29, 2014, a two volume original soundtrack was also released on iTunes. The soundtrack was also released as a vinyl LP by Brave Wave Productions in January 2018, and includes interviews with Senoue and Iizuka. Rereleases =Sonic Adventure 2: Battle= In 2001, Sega departed the console business to be a software publisher. Sonic Adventure 2 was ported to the Nintendo GameCube as Sonic Adventure 2: Battle on February 11, 2002. Battle has more detailed textures and additional geometry, and adds multiplayer options including new abilities, upgrades, and exclusive characters, and removes online play.Sonic Adventure 2: Battle (GameCube) instruction manual, pp. 18‚Äì23. Big the Cat is replaced by a Dark Chao in multiplayer mode.Sonic Adventure 2: Battle (GameCube) instruction manual, p. 21. Battle also upgrades much of the Chao system, with a Chao's stats viewable within the game,Sonic Adventure 2: Battle (GameCube) instruction manual, pp. 50‚Äì55. and the option to transfer Chao from Sonic Adventure 2 Battle to the Tiny Chao Garden in Sonic Advance, Sonic Advance 2, and Sonic Pinball Party with the GameCube ‚Äì Game Boy Advance link cable. If a Game Boy Advance is connected without a game, a version of the Tiny Chao Garden can be copied temporarily into the Game Boy Advance memory. This version also introduces the Chao Karate feature.Sonic Adventure 2: Battle (GameCube) instruction manual, p. 46. In Europe, Battle was marketed and distributed by Infogrames, following a deal to distribute Sega's games on the GameCube and GBA. =Downloadable versions= Sonic Adventure 2 was re-released in high definition on the PlayStation Network in North America on October 2, 2012, in Europe on October 3, 2012 and in Japan on October 4, 2012. It was released worldwide on the Xbox Live Arcade on October 5, 2012 and on Windows via Steam on November 19, 2012. The additional Battle content is available as downloadable content. Reception Sonic Adventure 2 received generally favorable reviews. Critics appreciated the game's multiple playing styles. According to Edge and reviewer Four-Eyed Dragon of GamePro, the core game's three styles and bonus features such as Chao gardens made the game engaging. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution praised its replay value of multiple playing styles and 180 different goals. Anthony Chau of IGN called it one of the best Sonic games: \\"If this is the last Sonic game in these declining Dreamcast years, it's satisfying to know that the DC didn't go out with a bang, but with a sonic boom.\\" Shahed Ahmed of GameSpot criticized the camera for the \\"cardinal sin\\" of 3D platformers: forcing a player to jump to an out-of-frame platform. Ahmed wrote that although a player can re-orient the camera with the trigger buttons, it reverts when the character moves. According to Chau and Liu camera issues were absent in Tails' and Eggman's levels and insignificant in Sonic's and Shadow's, but searching for Emerald shards and items in cramped sections of Knuckles' and Rouge's levels was frustrating. Edge found camera problems permeating the game, with no significant improvement from Adventure. Liu called the graphics \\"sweet, sweet eye-crack\\". Four-Eyed Dragon wrote that the game \\"is simply jaw-dropping beautiful\\", citing its detailed backgrounds and scenery and the characters' extensive color palettes. According to Chau, the game had \\"some of the best textures ever seen\\" and was one of the most beautiful Dreamcast games. Edge was impressed by the texture detail and draw distance, and Chau, Liu and Ahmed praised its 60-frame-per-second rendering speed. According to Ahmed, the game's music was an improvement over Adventure \\"campy glam-rock and J-pop soundtrack\\", with less emphasis on lyrics, and Liu appreciated its more \\"understated\\" approach. Four-Eyed Dragon called the music \\"an eclectic mix of orchestrated masterpieces, guitar tunes, and melodic hip- hop voices gracefully fill the game's ambiance to a perfect pitch.\\" Reaction to the voice acting was mixed; although Ahmed said, \\"The voice acting, and the lip-synching in particular, is executed quite well\\", Liu and Chau thought the English voices were inferior to the Japanese ones. Ahmed criticized the plot: \\"Throughout the game the plot becomes more and more scattered and lackluster\\", not focusing long enough on one element to execute it meaningfully. Although Liu agreed that despite the game's ambitious scope and themes it failed to advance the series' core plot beyond the Sega Genesis Sonic games, Edge appreciated the story's presentation from both perspectives: hero and villain. Despite high review scores for the Dreamcast version, the GameCube version released six months later received poorer reviews: respective Metacritic and GameRankings scores of 73 percent and 72.33 percent. Critics generally felt that although the game was still enjoyable, it was not significantly improved from the Dreamcast original. However, Shane Bettenhausen of GameSpy saw Battle as noticeably superior; in addition to its upgrades, its action was better suited to the GameCube's controller than the Dreamcast's. The game sold almost 50,000 copies in its first week in Japan. By July 2006, it had sold 1.2 million copies and earned $44 million in the United States. Next Generation ranked it as the 42nd highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. It sold 1.44 million copies in the United States by December 2007, making it one of the best-selling GameCube games. Sonic Adventure 2 received several accolades, including the 2001 IGN's Editors' Choice Award. ScrewAttack called it the fifth-best Dreamcast game, and GamesRadar rated it the tenth-greatest Dreamcast game out of 25: \\"Despite trailing off significantly in recent years, the 3D side of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise had a surprisingly stellar start with the Sonic Adventure entries, and the 2001 sequel really amped up the action\\". In February 2014, IGN's Luke Karmali called Battle his tenth- favorite game of all time. Legacy Shadow and Rouge, who debuted in Adventure 2, have become recurring characters in the Sonic franchise. Both appeared along with new character E-123 Omega as \\"Team Dark\\", one of the playable character teams, in Sonic Heroes (2003), the follow-up to Adventure 2. Shadow starred in his own game, Shadow the Hedgehog (2005), which expands on many of Adventure 2 plot points and features a similar 3D platforming gameplay style. With a few modifications, the plots of Adventure and Adventure 2 were adapted into the second season of the anime Sonic X (2003‚Äì06). American licensing corporation 4Kids Entertainment hired an entirely new voice cast for the English dub, but the Japanese cast from the games reprised their roles in the original version of the show. Sonic Generations (2011), released to mark the series' twentieth anniversary, contains gameplay elements and levels from various Sonic games, including Adventure 2. Elements from Sonic Adventure 2 included a remake of the City Escape stage in the console versions and a remake of the Radical Highway stage in the Nintendo 3DS version. Shadow also appears in a recreation of his boss battle, and the Biolizard boss is recreated exclusively in the 3DS version.

It was the first Peter Gabriel album to be released on Real World Records. It is his second soundtrack and eighth album overall. It was originally composed as the soundtrack album for the film The Last Temptation of Christ, but Gabriel spent several months after the film's release further developing the music, finally releasing it as a full-fledged album instead of a movie soundtrack. It is seen as a landmark in the popularisation of world music, and won a Grammy Award for Best New Age Album in 1990. It was remastered with most of Gabriel's catalogue in 2002. Overview As the soundtrack for the film, Gabriel used the resources of the organization he founded, WOMAD, to bring together musicians from the Middle East, Africa, Europe and South Asia. He worked with them to create music meant to enhance the mood of the film, but also added a modern ambient musical touch to the original pieces, producing a musical work that has influenced many musicians in the years since its release. Passion introduced many listeners to such artists as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Youssou N'Dour, L. Shankar, and Baaba Maal. Later in the year a companion album was released, Passion ‚Äì Sources, featuring additional songs on which Gabriel does not perform. Gabriel described this album as \\"a selection of some of the traditional music, sources of inspiration, and location recordings.\\" The cover art for the album, Drawing study for Self Image II (1987), is a mixed media composition by the artist Julian Grater. When re-released, the album was titled Passion: Music for The Last Temptation of Christ due to \\"legal barriers\\" according to Gabriel in its liner notes.

It was founded in AD 910 when the Christian princes of Asturias along the northern coast of the peninsula shifted their capital from Oviedo to the city of Le√≥n. The Kings of Le√≥n fought civil wars, wars against neighbouring kingdoms, and campaigns to repel invasions by both the Moors and the Vikings, all in order to protect their kingdom's changing fortunes. Garc√≠a is the first of the kings described by the charters as reigning in Le√≥n. It is generally assumed that the old Asturian kingdom was divided among the three sons of Alfonso III of Asturias: Garc√≠a (Le√≥n), Ordo√±o (Galicia) and Fruela (Asturias), as all three participated in the deposition of their father. When Garc√≠a died in 914, Le√≥n went to Ordo√±o, who now ruled both Le√≥n and Galicia as Ordo√±o II. At Ordo√±o's death in 924, the throne went to his brother Fruela II (924‚Äì5), who died of leprosy a year later. Fruela's death in 925 was followed by a civil war, after which Alfonso, the eldest son of Ordo√±o II, emerged as the new king Alfonso IV, ruling from 925‚Äì932. After a further power struggle, Ramiro, the younger brother of Alfonso IV, became king in 932, having captured his brother Alfonso, as well as the three sons of Fruela II ‚Äì Alfonso, Ordo√±o and Ramiro. Alfonso IV may have died soon after, but he left two infant sons, called Ordo√±o and Fruela. When Ramiro died in 951, he left two sons by two different wives. When the elder son Ordo≈ào III, who ruled from 951‚Äì56, suddenly died aged little more than thirty, he was succeeded by his younger half-brother Sancho I \\"The Fat\\" (956‚Äì66), as Ordo√±o had failed to produce a legitimate heir. Sancho's son Ramiro had been born in 961 and was only about five years old when his father died. He was also the only legitimate member of the direct family line. His mother Teresa Ans√∫rez had retired into the recently founded monastery of San Pelayo, of which her sister-in-law Elvira was the abbess. Another nun, Sancho's full sister Elvira Ram√≠rez emerged as regent during his long minority. Under the regency of Elvira, fresh raids of the Northmen were repelled from the coast of Galicia. In 968, Gunrod of Norway, the Viking leader, established himself on Galician soil and held out for a year and a half: Bishop Sisnando of Compostela died fighting him, and his successor St Rudesind carried on the struggle until Count Gonzalo S√°nchez defeated the invaders and killed Gunrod himself. Count S√°nchez destroyed the entire fleet of Gunrod. In 1008 Norman Vikings attacked Galicia, destroying Santiago de Compostela and seventeen other towns, while Olaf Haraldsson of Norway raided Spain's Atlantic coast. There are also reports of a series of attacks on the Christian lands of north Spain in 1028, 1032, and 1038, and the Christian kingdoms in the north commonly used Vikings as mercenaries in their internecine wars. The County of Castile separated in 931, the County of Portugal separated to become the independent Kingdom of Portugal in 1139 and the eastern, inland part of Le√≥n was joined to the Kingdom of Castile in 1230. From 1296 to 1301, the Kingdom of Le√≥n was again independent and after the re- union with Castile remained a Crown until 1833, but as part of a united Spain from 1479. In the Royal Decree of 30 November 1833, the Kingdom of Le√≥n was considered one of the Spanish regions and divided into the provinces of Le√≥n, Zamora and Salamanca. In 1978, these three provinces of the region of Le√≥n were included along with six provinces of the historic region of Old Castile to create the autonomous community of Castile and Le√≥n. However, significant parts of the former kingdom today integrate these three provinces and the autonomous communities of Extremadura, Galicia and Asturias, in Spain, in addition to northern Portugal.  Background  The city of Le√≥n was founded by the Roman Seventh Legion (usually written as Legio Septima Gemina (\\"twin seventh legion\\"). It was the headquarters of that legion in the Late Roman Empire and was a centre for trade in gold, which was mined at Las M√©dulas nearby. In 540, the city was conquered by the Arian Visigothic king Liuvigild, who did not harass the already well-established Roman Catholic population. In AD 717, Le√≥n fell again, this time to the Moors. However, Le√≥n was one of the first cities retaken during the Christian reconquest of the Iberian peninsula, and became part of the Kingdom of Asturias in AD 742. Le√≥n was a small town during this time, but one of the few former Roman cities in the Kingdom of Asturias which still held significance (the surviving Roman walls bear the medieval walling upon them). During Visigothic times, the city had served as a bishopric, and incorporating the city into Asturias brought legitimacy to the Asturian monarchs who sought to lead a unified Iberian church, during a time when most of the Iberian Peninsula was governed by Muslim powers.  History  Le√≥n was created as a separate kingdom when the Asturian king, Alfonso the Great, divided his realm among his three sons. Le√≥n was inherited by Garc√≠a I (910‚Äì914) who moved the capital of the kingdom of Astures to Le√≥n. His successor was Ordo√±o II of Le√≥n (914‚Äì924). Ordo√±o II was also a military leader who brought expeditions from Le√≥n south to Seville, C√≥rdoba, and Guadalajara, in the heart of the Muslim territory. The new kingdom of Le√≥n, 910 After a few years of civil wars during the reigns of Fruela II, Alfonso Fr√≥ilaz and Alfonso IV, Ramiro II (931‚Äì951) assumed the throne and brought stability to the kingdom. A brave military commander who defeated the Muslim armies in their own territory, Ramiro's expeditions turned the Valley of the Douro into a no-man's land that separated Christian kingdoms in the north of Iberia from the Muslim states in the south. Ramiro II was nicknamed \\"The Devil\\" by Muslims because of his great military skill. As the Leonese troops advanced they were followed by a process of repoblaci√≥n, which consisted of repopulating the Meseta high plains, with people coming from Galicia and especially from Asturias and Le√≥n. This migration of Leonese peoples greatly influenced the Leonese language. During the repoblaci√≥n period, there arose a distinct form of art known as Mozarabic art. Mozarabic art is a mixing of Visigoth, Islamic, and Byzantine elements. Notable examples of the Mozarabic style are the Leonese churches of San Miguel de Escalada and Santiago de Pe√±alba. During the early 10th century, Le√≥n expanded to the south and east, securing territory that became the County of Burgos. Fortified with numerous castles, Burgos remained within Leon until the 930s, at which time Count Ferdinand II of Castile began a campaign to expand Burgos and make it independent and hereditary. He took for himself the title Count of Castile, in reference to the many castles of the territory (around Burgos), and continued expanding his area at the expense of Le√≥n by allying with the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba, until AD 966, when he was defeated by Sancho I of Le√≥n. = Viking raids = Sancho I died towards the end of 966 and five year old Ramiro III (966‚Äì982) ascended to the throne of Le√≥n. In the second year of his reign, 968, a Viking fleet of 100 ships landed in Galicia led by king Gunrod. The Vikings defeated the Galician forces, and killed Sisnando, the bishop of Compostela. The defeat in the Battle of Fornelos left Galicia without an authority capable of facing the Vikings, whom for three years camped comfortably, looting different Galician regions. In 971, Gunrod and his Vikings were surprised and defeated by Count Gonzalo S√°nchez upon return towards R√≠a de Ferrol (where they had their stranded ships). The Galician troops captured Gunrod and many of his warriors, executing them all.Eduardo Morales Moreno: Los vikingos en Espa√±a. Revista Historia de Iberia Vieja, n.¬∫ 12, Madrid: HRH Editores, 2006. Sporadic Viking assaults continued in the north of Spain even into the 11th century. In 1008, Galicia and the Douro region were attacked, and in 1014 or 1015 a major raid was launched against the city of Tui at the mouth of the Minho River. The Vikings managed to successfully capture the bishop and many of the town's inhabitants. Knytlinga saga and Gesta Danorum describe another big raid after this one, in the year 1028. It was led by Ulv Galiciefarer, who tried to go to Arousa and then became a mercenary for Rodrigo Rom√°niz, but was defeated by the bishop of Compostela. The last recorded raids occurred during the period 1047‚Äì66 when Cresconius, the bishop of Compostela, fought and won several battles against the Vikings. = Peak = The Kingdom of Le√≥n in 1037 The Kingdom of Le√≥n continued to be the most important of all those of the Iberian Peninsula. However, Sancho III of Navarre (1004‚Äì1035) took over Castile in the 1020s, and managed Le√≥n in the last year of his life, leaving Galicia to temporary independence. In the division of lands which followed his death, his son Fernando succeeded to the county of Castile. Two years later, in 1037, he defeated the king of Le√≥n who died in the battle and, because Fernando was married to the Le√≥nese king's sister, he became king of Le√≥n and Galicia. For nearly 30 years, until his death in 1065, he ruled over the kingdom of Le√≥n and the county of Castile as Ferdinand I of Le√≥n. Early in its existence, Le√≥n lay directly to the north of the powerful Caliphate of C√≥rdoba. When internal dissensions divided Al-Andalus' loyalties in the 11th century, leading to the age of smaller Taifa successor states of the Caliphate, the Christian kingdoms, who had been sending tribute to the Caliphate, found themselves in a position to demand payments (parias) instead, in return for favours to particular factions or as simple extortion. Thus, though scarcely influenced by the culture of the successor territories of the former Caliphate, Ferdinand I followed the example of the counts of Barcelona and the kings of Aragon and became hugely wealthy from the parias of the Taifas. When he died in 1065, his territories and the parias were split among his three sons, of whom Alfonso emerged the victor in the classic fratricidal strife common to feudal successions. Few in Europe would have known of this immense new wealth in a kingdom so isolated that its bishops had virtually no contact with Rome, except that Ferdinand and his heirs (the kings of Le√≥n and Castile) became the greatest benefactors of the Abbey of Cluny, where Abbot Hugh (died 1109) undertook construction of the huge third abbey church, the cynosure of every eye. The Way of Saint James called pilgrims from Western Europe to the supposed tomb of Saint James the Great in Santiago de Compostela, and the large hostels and churches along the route encouraged building in the Romanesque style. Alfonso VI was one of the most important kings of Le√≥n of the Middle Ages. He assumed control of first Le√≥n, and later Castile and Galicia, when his brother died attacking the Leonese city of Zamora. He was crowned Emperor of Spain over all the kings of the Iberian Peninsula. = Le√≥n and Castile = Flag of Kingdom of Le√≥n at the times of King Alfonso VII (1105‚Äì1157) Shield of Alfonso IX displayed in the Tumbo A manuscript of 12th century. purple lion emblem displayed in the Tumbo A. The taking of Toledo, the old Visigoth capital, in 1085 by Alfonso VI of Le√≥n was a turning point in the development of Le√≥n and Castile and the first major milestone in the Reconquista. Christian Mozarabs from Al-Andalus had come north to populate the deserted frontier lands, and the traditional view of Spanish history has been that they brought with them the remains of Visigothic and Classical culture, and a new ideology of Reconquista, a crusade against the Moors. Modern historians see the fall of Toledo as marking a basic change in relations with the Moorish south, turning from the simple extortion of annual tribute to outright territorial expansion. Alfonso VI was drawn into local politics by strife within Toledo and inherited the political alliances of the city-state. He found himself faced with problems unfamiliar to him, such as appointing and dealing with a Catholic bishop in Toledo and the settling of garrisons in the small Muslim strongholds, the taifas, which were dependent on Toledo and which often bought the king's favour with gold from their trade with Al-Andalus and the Maghreb. Alfonso VI thus found his role as a Catholic king redefined as he governed large cities with sophisticated urban, Muslim subjects and growing Christian populations. The two kingdoms of Le√≥n and Castile were split in 1157, when a major defeat for Alfonso VII of Castile weakened the authority of Castile. A map of the Kingdom of Le√≥n in 1210 The last two kings of an independent Kingdom of Le√≥n (1157-1230) were Ferdinand II and Alfonso IX. Fernando II led Le√≥n's conquest of M√©rida, a city dating from Roman times. Alfonso IX, besides conquering the whole of Extremadura (including the cities of C√°ceres and Badajoz), was the most modern king of his time, founding the University of Salamanca in 1212 and summoning in 1188 the first parliament with representation of the citizenry ever seen in Europe, the Cortes of Le√≥n. Alfonso IX did not want his kingdom to disappear upon his death and designated his heirs as Sancha and Dulce, the daughters of his first wife. In order to maintain the independence of the Kingdom of Le√≥n, Afonso IX in his testament applied the Galician right of inheritance, that equaled in the succession men and women, leaving his daughters to be the future queens of Le√≥n. However, when Alfonso IX died in 1230, his son by Berenguela of Castile, Ferdinand III of Castile, invaded Le√≥n and assumed the crown. He thus became the first joint sovereign of both kingdoms since the death of Alfonso VII in 1157. The isolated Atlantic province, the County of Portugal, had won independence in 1139 to become the Kingdom of Portugal. The union between Le√≥n and Castile was never accepted by the Leonese people. King Ferdinand III needed 2 years to suppress the secessionist revolts in the Kingdom of Le√≥n, so his son Alfonso X restored the independence of the Kingdom of Le√≥n. However, this was not respected by his successor Sancho IV. His brother John waited until 1296, following Sancho's death the previous year, to be crowned as John I, King of Le√≥n, Galicia and Sevilla. In 1301 he abdicated and the king of Castile assumed the Crown of Le√≥n, reuniting the two kingdoms. Leonese royal arms with crest (after the union with Castile) Though the kings of Castile and Le√≥n initially continued to take the title King of Le√≥n as the superior title, and to use a lion as part of their standard, power in fact became centralized in Castile, as exemplified by the Leonese language's replacement by Spanish. The Kingdom of Le√≥n and the Kingdom of Castile kept different Parliaments, different flags, different coin and different laws until the Modern Era, when Spain, like other European states, centralized governmental power. Modern era The Kingdom of Le√≥n coexisted as a personal union under the Crown of Castile, with Le√≥n possessing separate institutions, such as its own cortes, the Real Adelantamiento of the Kingdom of Le√≥n, and the Merino mayor of Le√≥n, among others, many of which lasted until the 19th century. The Castilian monarchs, however, soon began a process of unifying the laws of the two kingdoms, as exemplified by the Siete Partidas. By the 16th century, Le√≥n became a captaincy-general.  19th century  In the 19th century, the Kingdom of Le√≥n declared war, together with Galicia and Asturias, against France, and organised the Junta General del Reino de Le√≥n as its own government. The modern region of Le√≥n was established in 1833Real Decreto de 30 de noviembre de 1833 and was divided into Le√≥n, Zamora, and Salamanca provinces.  Present  At present, Le√≥n is composed of the provinces of Le√≥n, Zamora, and Salamanca, and is now part of the autonomous community of Castile and Le√≥n within the modern Kingdom of Spain. Political parties representing \\"Leonesismo\\", the Leonese regionalist and nationalist movements, support the creation of an autonomous community separate from Castile. Leonesist parties gained 13.6% of votes cast in the Le√≥n autonomic elections in 2007. There have also been initiatives approved by some Leonese city councils to establish a NUTS-2 (European Statistical Region) for Le√≥n.

It was founded in 1912, and its central business district started developing in 1915. The neighborhood was devoted to agriculture for many years. Earthquakes struck the area in 1971 and 1994. The neighborhood has fifteen public and five private schools. The community includes public parks, a senior center and a regional branch library. Parts of Reseda have been used in several motion picture and television productions. History =Founding and growth= The area now known as Reseda, like much of Los Angeles County, originally was inhabited by Native Americans of the Tongva tribe who lived close to what is now known as the Los Angeles River. In 1909 the Suburban Homes Company, a syndicate led by H. J. Whitley, general manager of the Board of Control, along with Harry Chandler, H. G. Otis, M. H. Sherman and O. F. Brandt purchased 48,000 acres of the Farming and Milling Company for $2,500,000.Mulholland, Catherine. The Owensmouth Baby - The Making of the San Fernando Valley Santa Susana Press, California, 1987; p. 18-20. Henry E. Huntington, extended his Pacific Electric Railway (Red Cars) through the Valley to Owensmouth (now Canoga Park). The Suburban Home Company laid out plans for roads and the towns of Van Nuys, Reseda (Marian) and Canoga Park (Owensmouth). The rural areas were annexed into the city of Los Angeles in 1915. On April 2, 1915 H. J. Whitley purchased the Suburban Home Company so that he would have complete control for finishing the development.Special Collections-URL UCLA Library, Retrieved December 20, 1990, box 7. On land that was originally part of the San Fernando Mission, Reseda originated in 1912 as the town of Marian. It was named after Marian Otis Chandler, the daughter of the Los Angeles Times publisher, Harrison Gray Otis and wife of Harry Chandler. The name Reseda itself refers to the fragrant plant Reseda odorata (English name is mignonette) which was commonly found in gardens of the time and is native to many areas with a Mediterranean climate. The geographic name \\"Reseda\\" was first used for a siding on a branch of the Southern Pacific Railroad, which ran between the cities of Burbank and Chatsworth in the San Fernando Valley. In the 1920s, the name Reseda was transferred from the Southern Pacific Railroad to the Western Division of the Pacific Electric Railway \\"Red Cars Line\\", which had expedited development after the building of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. Later, it was used as the name of a stop on the Pacific Electric interurban railway running along Sherman Way. Throughout this time the town's name of Marian remained; then in 1921, when a Fourth Class Post Office was found to be necessary, the town's name had to be changed. As the Zelzah Tribune reported: > The Marian territory has made application for a post office to serve that > district. To avoid confusion in mail distribution it is necessary that the > name of the town be changed and the people of that community have decided > upon the name Reseda, and if the application is granted it will be the only > post office in the United States by that name. Mrs. Turner, we are told, who > has taken an active interest in the canvass and to create a sentiment for > post office advantages, will possibly be the postmistress.Van Nuys News, > December 1, 1921 Ninety-two residents convened and agreed to rename the town Reseda. The central business district began in 1915, at what is now the intersection of Reseda Boulevard and Sherman Way, with the construction of a hardware store. Soon a blacksmith shop and an auto repair garage were built nearby. Within a short time, these were followed by a grocery store and a drug store. There were no sidewalks or pavement yet; most were added between 1918 and the early 1920s. On the southwest corner of Sherman Way a wooden building housed the volunteer Fire Department until 1922, when the present brick building was erected as was the Reseda Bank. The wooden building, housing the Fire Department, was then moved to the southeast side of Sherman Way, where it remained until 1933. In May 1929, the city's namesake roadway, Reseda Avenue, was renamed Reseda Boulevard by a Los Angeles City ordinance. Parts of the original 1920s and 1930s residential neighborhood remain and are found to the southwest of Sherman Way and Reseda Boulevard. Reseda grew slowly, with the stock market crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression further slowing expansion. During the late 1920s and 1930s, the area‚Äôs reputation developed for its production of lettuce, lima beans, sugar beets, and walnuts, becoming known as was one of the largest producers of lettuce in the United States by the late ‚Äò30s. The Southern Pacific Railroad trains came up the middle of Sherman Way to pick up freight cars of lettuce on a daily basis during the lettuce harvest season. Around that time, manufacturing roof tile, canning poultry products, and processing walnuts began to emerge as viable businesses as well. = Postwar suburb = Facing west on Sherman Way Reseda remained primarily an agricultural community with a population of 1,805 in 1930. However, by 1940 the population had increased to 4,147 residents. The mid to later 1940s saw a large increase in the numbers of single-family dwellings in Reseda and the loss of numerous acres of agriculture, and the addition of First Class Postal Service. Reseda was one of the first suburbs in the San Fernando Valley. The large ranches were subdivided, and the area was developed by realtors just as the veterans of World War II were returning home. The familiar orange groves were successively plowed under in favor of housing. At the time, most of the jobs were in the Los Angeles Basin and to the south, over the Santa Monica mountains. By 1950, Reseda had over 16,000 residents and in the early 1950s, a population explosion took place, making Reseda one of the most popular and populated of all Valley communities. Because of this, Reseda's merchants provided bus service to transport shoppers throughout the busy downtown Reseda areas. In the early 1950s, the Valley's population reached 400,000. The average new Valley home, in 1949, cost $9,000. By 1955, that same house could be resold for nearly $15,000. Even at that price, though, a household income was about $6,000 a year, making Valley incomes higher than the national average. By 1960, the average market value of a Valley home reached $18,850. During the 1970s, the above-average residential real estate values and income patterns compared to the rest of the country began to reverse. Land and housing costs shot upward, while most incomes only crept. By the beginning of the 1980s, the average price of a home in the Valley reached $110,000. According to a 2004 study by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, it has tripled that of the early 1980s. =Northridge earthquake= The 1994 Northridge earthquake struck at 4:31 a.m. on January 17 and measured 6.7 on the moment magnitude scale.

Featured sites Reseda Theatre, March 2010 The Reseda Country Club, of Boogie Nights fame, was a well-known concert venue during the Los Angeles punk rock and new wave scenes of the 1980s. Located at the intersection of Canby Avenue and Sherman Way, the Country Club was host to bands, including Oingo Boingo, U2, Culture Club, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, and Roxy Music, from 1980 to 1982. The site which began in the 1950s as one of the first Sav-On Drug stores in the San Fernando Valley, later became a night club and remained a dance hall and music venue throughout the 1990s; it was also used as a boxing venue. The site later became and since remains a Spanish-language Christian church. The Reseda Theater, at 18443 Sherman Way, was built in 1948 and closed in 1988.

Biography  Born in Radon, Orne, and living most of his life in L√©zardrieux, Le Flem studied at the Schola Cantorum under Vincent d'Indy and Albert Roussel, later teaching at the same establishment, where his pupils included Erik Satie and Andr√© Jolivet. His music is strongly influenced by his native Brittany, the landscape of which is reflected in most of his work. Before World War I, Le Flem produced several major works, including his First Symphony, a Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra, and an opera. The war temporarily put an end to his compositional activities, and in its aftermath he devoted himself to music criticism and choral conducting. He wrote numerous articles for the periodical Comoedia. In 1937, he began composing once again. Three additional symphonies and a second opera followed before he was finally forced to give up composition in 1976, at the age of 95, due to blindness. He died on 31 July 1984 at the age of 103. Some of his dramatic works include the operas Le Rossignol de St-Malo (The Nightingale of St Malo) and La Magicienne de la mer (The Magician of the Sea), as well as a version of the chante-fable Aucassin et Nicolette. For the Dead and the seven Pi√®ces enfantines, both originally written in 1911, were orchestrated some years later. Two of the composer's children died young, and For the Dead is dedicated to their memory. In addition to his symphonies, Le Flem wrote evocative orchestral music such as En mer (At Sea) and La Voix du large (The Voice of the Open Sea). Le Flem also composed the music for Jean Tedesco's short film The Great Gardener of France in 1942. Le Flem was a member of the Association des Compositeurs Breton; another member, the Irish-American Swan Hennessy (1866‚Äì1929) dedicated his Petit trio celtique, Op. 52 (1921) to Le Flem. Personal life  Paul Le Flem, with his wife, Jeanne (Even), was the grandfather of actress Marika Green and great-grandfather of actress Eva Green by his daughter, Jeanne, who married Swedish journalist Lennart Green.Le Flem's family genealogy Article published in Ouest-France, 24 January 2007: \\"Fifteen days after her husband, Lennart Green, Jeanne Green-Le Flem [...] died Friday aged 95 [...].

They have many important applications in such areas as mathematical physics (in particular, the theory of random matrices), approximation theory, numerical analysis, and many others. Classical orthogonal polynomials appeared in the early 19th century in the works of Adrien-Marie Legendre, who introduced the Legendre polynomials. In the late 19th century, the study of continued fractions to solve the moment problem by P. L. Chebyshev and then A.A. Markov and T.J. Stieltjes led to the general notion of orthogonal polynomials. For given polynomials Q, L: \\\\R \\\\to \\\\R and \\\\forall\\\\,n \\\\in \\\\N_0 the classical orthogonal polynomials f_n:\\\\R \\\\to \\\\R are characterized by being solutions of the differential equation :Q(x) \\\\, f_n^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} + L(x)\\\\,f_n^{\\\\prime} + \\\\lambda_n f_n = 0 with to be determined constants \\\\lambda_n \\\\in \\\\R. There are several more general definitions of orthogonal classical polynomials; for example, use the term for all polynomials in the Askey scheme.  Definition  In general, the orthogonal polynomials P_n with respect to a weight W:\\\\mathbb R \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb R^+ :\\\\begin{align} &\\\\deg P_n = n~, \\\\quad n = 0,1,2,\\\\ldots\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\int P_m(x) \\\\, P_n(x) \\\\, W(x)\\\\,dx = 0~, \\\\quad m eq n~. \\\\end{align} The relations above define P_n up to multiplication by a number. Various normalisations are used to fix the constant, e.g. : \\\\int P_n(x)^2 W(x)\\\\,dx = 1~. The classical orthogonal polynomials correspond to the three families of weights: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{(Jacobi)}\\\\quad &W;(x) = \\\\begin{cases} (1 - x)^\\\\alpha (1+x)^\\\\beta~, & -1 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0~, &\\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{(Hermite)}\\\\quad &W;(x) = \\\\exp(- x^2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{(Laguerre)}\\\\quad &W;(x) = \\\\begin{cases} x^\\\\alpha \\\\exp(- x)~, & x \\\\geq 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0~, & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} The standard normalisation (also called standardization) is detailed below. =Jacobi polynomials= For \\\\alpha,\\\\,\\\\beta>-1 the Jacobi polynomials are given by the formula :P_n^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)} (z) = \\\\frac{(-1)^n}{2^n n!} (1-z)^{-\\\\alpha} (1+z)^{-\\\\beta} \\\\frac{d^n}{dz^n} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ (1-z)^\\\\alpha (1+z)^\\\\beta (1 - z^2)^n \\\\right\\\\\\\\}~. They are normalised (standardized) by :P_n^{(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta)} (1) = {n+\\\\alpha\\\\choose n}, and satisfy the orthogonality condition :\\\\begin{align} &\\\\int_{-1}^1 (1-x)^{\\\\alpha} (1+x)^{\\\\beta} P_m^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)} (x)P_n^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)} (x) \\\\; dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {} & \\\\frac{2^{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta+1}}{2n+\\\\alpha+\\\\beta+1} \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(n+\\\\alpha+1)\\\\Gamma(n+\\\\beta+1)}{\\\\Gamma(n+\\\\alpha+\\\\beta+1)n!} \\\\delta_{nm}. \\\\end{align} The Jacobi polynomials are solutions to the differential equation : (1-x^2)y + ( \\\\beta-\\\\alpha - (\\\\alpha + \\\\beta + 2)x )y'+ n(n+\\\\alpha+\\\\beta+1) y = 0~.  Important special cases  The Jacobi polynomials with \\\\alpha=\\\\beta are called the Gegenbauer polynomials (with parameter \\\\gamma = \\\\alpha+1/2) For \\\\alpha=\\\\beta=0, these are called the Legendre polynomials (for which the interval of orthogonality is [‚àí1, 1] and the weight function is simply 1): : P_0(x) = 1,\\\\, P_1(x) = x,\\\\,P_2(x) = \\\\frac{3x^2-1}{2},\\\\, P_3(x) = \\\\frac{5x^3-3x}{2},\\\\ldots For \\\\alpha=\\\\beta=\\\\pm 1/2, one obtains the Chebyshev polynomials (of the second and first kind, respectively). =Hermite polynomials= The Hermite polynomials are defined byother conventions are also used; see Hermite polynomials. : H_n(x)=(-1)^n e^{x^2}\\\\frac{d^n}{dx^n}e^{-x^2}=e^{x^2/2}\\\\bigg (x-\\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\bigg )^n e^{-x^2/2} They satisfy the orthogonality condition : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty H_n(x) H_m(x) e^{-x^2} \\\\, dx = \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} 2^n n! \\\\delta_{mn}~, and the differential equation :y - 2xy' + 2n\\\\,y = 0~. =Laguerre polynomials= The generalised Laguerre polynomials are defined by : L_n^{(\\\\alpha)}(x)= {x^{-\\\\alpha} e^x \\\\over n!}{d^n \\\\over dx^n} \\\\left(e^{-x} x^{n+\\\\alpha}\\\\right) (the classical Laguerre polynomials correspond to \\\\alpha=0.)

Differential equation  The classical orthogonal polynomials arise from a differential equation of the form : Q(x) \\\\, f + L(x)\\\\,f' + \\\\lambda f = 0 where Q is a given quadratic (at most) polynomial, and L is a given linear polynomial. The function f, and the constant Œª, are to be found. :(Note that it makes sense for such an equation to have a polynomial solution. :Each term in the equation is a polynomial, and the degrees are consistent.) This is a Sturm‚ÄìLiouville type of equation. Such equations generally have singularities in their solution functions f except for particular values of Œª. They can be thought of an eigenvector/eigenvalue problems: Letting D be the differential operator, D(f) = Q f + L f', and changing the sign of Œª, the problem is to find the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) f, and the corresponding eigenvalues Œª, such that f does not have singularities and D(f) = Œªf. The solutions of this differential equation have singularities unless Œª takes on specific values. There is a series of numbers Œª0, Œª1, Œª2, ... that led to a series of polynomial solutions P0, P1, P2, ... if one of the following sets of conditions are met: # Q is actually quadratic, L is linear, Q has two distinct real roots, the root of L lies strictly between the roots of Q, and the leading terms of Q and L have the same sign. # Q is not actually quadratic, but is linear, L is linear, the roots of Q and L are different, and the leading terms of Q and L have the same sign if the root of L is less than the root of Q, or vice versa. # Q is just a nonzero constant, L is linear, and the leading term of L has the opposite sign of Q. These three cases lead to the Jacobi-like, Laguerre-like, and Hermite- like polynomials, respectively. In each of these three cases, we have the following: * The solutions are a series of polynomials P0, P1, P2, ..., each Pn having degree n, and corresponding to a number Œªn. * The interval of orthogonality is bounded by whatever roots Q has. * The root of L is inside the interval of orthogonality. * Letting R(x) = e^{\\\\int \\\\frac{L(x)}{Q(x)}\\\\,dx}, the polynomials are orthogonal under the weight function W(x) =\\\\frac{R(x)}{Q(x)} * W(x) has no zeros or infinities inside the interval, though it may have zeros or infinities at the end points. * W(x) gives a finite inner product to any polynomials. * W(x) can be made to be greater than 0 in the interval. (Negate the entire differential equation if necessary so that Q(x) > 0 inside the interval.) Because of the constant of integration, the quantity R(x) is determined only up to an arbitrary positive multiplicative constant. It will be used only in homogeneous differential equations (where this doesn't matter) and in the definition of the weight function (which can also be indeterminate.) The tables below will give the \\"official\\" values of R(x) and W(x). = Rodrigues' formula = Under the assumptions of the preceding section, Pn(x) is proportional to \\\\frac{1}{W(x)} \\\\ \\\\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\\\\left(W(x)[Q(x)]^n\\\\right). This is known as Rodrigues' formula, after Olinde Rodrigues. It is often written :P_n(x) = \\\\frac{1}{{e_n}W(x)} \\\\ \\\\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\\\\left(W(x)[Q(x)]^n\\\\right) where the numbers en depend on the standardization. The standard values of en will be given in the tables below. =The numbers Œªn= Under the assumptions of the preceding section, we have :\\\\lambda_n = - n \\\\left( \\\\frac{n-1}{2} Q + L' \\\\right). (Since Q is quadratic and L is linear, Q and L' are constants, so these are just numbers.) = Second form for the differential equation = Let :R(x) = e^{\\\\int \\\\frac{L(x)}{Q(x)}\\\\,dx}. Then :(Ry')' = R\\\\,y + R'\\\\,y' = R\\\\,y + \\\\frac{R\\\\,L}{Q}\\\\,y'. Now multiply the differential equation :Q\\\\,y + L\\\\,y' + \\\\lambda y = 0 by R/Q, getting :R\\\\,y + \\\\frac{R\\\\,L}{Q}\\\\,y' + \\\\frac{R\\\\,\\\\lambda}{Q}\\\\,y = 0 or :(Ry')' + \\\\frac{R\\\\,\\\\lambda}{Q}\\\\,y = 0. This is the standard Sturm‚ÄìLiouville form for the equation. =Third form for the differential equation= Let S(x) = \\\\sqrt{R(x)} = e^{\\\\int \\\\frac{L(x)}{2\\\\,Q(x)}\\\\,dx}. Then :S' = \\\\frac{S\\\\,L}{2\\\\,Q}. Now multiply the differential equation :Q\\\\,y + L \\\\,y' + \\\\lambda y = 0 by S/Q, getting :S\\\\,y + \\\\frac{S\\\\,L} Q \\\\,y' + \\\\frac{S\\\\,\\\\lambda} Q \\\\,y = 0 or :S\\\\,y + 2\\\\,S'\\\\,y' + \\\\frac{S\\\\,\\\\lambda} Q \\\\,y = 0 But (S\\\\,y) = S\\\\,y + 2\\\\,S'\\\\,y' + S\\\\,y, so :(S\\\\,y) + \\\\left(\\\\frac{S\\\\,\\\\lambda} Q - S\\\\right)\\\\,y = 0, or, letting u = Sy, :u + \\\\left(\\\\frac \\\\lambda Q - \\\\frac{S} S \\\\right)\\\\,u = 0. = Formulas involving derivatives = Under the assumptions of the preceding section, let P denote the r-th derivative of Pn. (We put the \\"r\\" in brackets to avoid confusion with an exponent.) P is a polynomial of degree n ‚àí r. Then we have the following: * (orthogonality) For fixed r, the polynomial sequence P, P, P, ... are orthogonal, weighted by WQ^r. * (generalized Rodrigues' formula) P is proportional to \\\\frac{1}{W(x)[Q(x)]^r} \\\\ \\\\frac{d^{n-r}}{dx^{n-r}}\\\\left(W(x)[Q(x)]^n\\\\right). * (differential equation) P is a solution of {Q}\\\\,y + (rQ'+L)\\\\,y' + [\\\\lambda_n-\\\\lambda_r]\\\\,y = 0, where Œªr is the same function as Œªn, that is, \\\\lambda_r = - r \\\\left( \\\\frac{r-1}{2} Q + L' \\\\right) * (differential equation, second form) P is a solution of (RQ^{r}y')' + [\\\\lambda_n-\\\\lambda_r]RQ^{r-1}\\\\,y = 0 There are also some mixed recurrences. In each of these, the numbers a, b, and c depend on n and r, and are unrelated in the various formulas. * P_n^{[r]} = aP_{n+1}^{[r+1]} + bP_n^{[r+1]} + cP_{n-1}^{[r+1]} * P_n^{[r]} = (ax+b)P_n^{[r+1]} + cP_{n-1}^{[r+1]} * QP_n^{[r+1]} = (ax+b)P_n^{[r]} + cP_{n-1}^{[r]} There are an enormous number of other formulas involving orthogonal polynomials in various ways. Here is a tiny sample of them, relating to the Chebyshev, associated Laguerre, and Hermite polynomials: * 2\\\\,T_{m}(x)\\\\,T_{n}(x) = T_{m+n}(x) + T_{m-n}(x) * H_{2n}(x) = (-4)^{n}\\\\,n!\\\\,L_{n}^{(-1/2)}(x^2) * H_{2n+1}(x) = 2(-4)^{n}\\\\,n!\\\\,x\\\\,L_{n}^{(1/2)}(x^2) = Orthogonality = The differential equation for a particular Œª may be written (omitting explicit dependence on x) :Q\\\\ddot{f}_n+L\\\\dot{f}_n+\\\\lambda_nf_n=0 multiplying by (R/Q)f_m yields :Rf_m\\\\ddot{f}_n+\\\\frac{R}{Q}Lf_m\\\\dot{f}_n+\\\\frac{R}{Q}\\\\lambda_nf_mf_n=0 and reversing the subscripts yields :Rf_n\\\\ddot{f}_m+\\\\frac{R}{Q}Lf_n\\\\dot{f}_m+\\\\frac{R}{Q}\\\\lambda_mf_nf_m=0 subtracting and integrating: : \\\\int_a^b \\\\left[R(f_m\\\\ddot{f}_n-f_n\\\\ddot{f}_m)+ \\\\frac{R}{Q}L(f_m\\\\dot{f}_n-f_n\\\\dot{f}_m)\\\\right] \\\\, dx +(\\\\lambda_n-\\\\lambda_m)\\\\int_a^b \\\\frac{R}{Q}f_mf_n \\\\, dx = 0 but it can be seen that : \\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left[R(f_m\\\\dot{f}_n-f_n\\\\dot{f}_m)\\\\right]= R(f_m\\\\ddot{f}_n- f_n\\\\ddot{f}_m)\\\\,\\\\,+\\\\,\\\\,R\\\\frac{L}{Q}(f_m\\\\dot{f}_n-f_n\\\\dot{f}_m) so that: :\\\\left[R(f_m\\\\dot{f}_n- f_n\\\\dot{f}_m)\\\\right]_a^b\\\\,\\\\,+\\\\,\\\\,(\\\\lambda_n-\\\\lambda_m)\\\\int_a^b \\\\frac{R}{Q}f_mf_n \\\\, dx=0 If the polynomials f are such that the term on the left is zero, and \\\\lambda_m e \\\\lambda_n for m e n, then the orthogonality relationship will hold: :\\\\int_a^b \\\\frac{R}{Q}f_mf_n \\\\, dx=0 for m e n.  Derivation from differential equation  All of the polynomial sequences arising from the differential equation above are equivalent, under scaling and/or shifting of the domain, and standardizing of the polynomials, to more restricted classes. Those restricted classes are exactly \\"classical orthogonal polynomials\\". * Every Jacobi-like polynomial sequence can have its domain shifted and/or scaled so that its interval of orthogonality is [‚àí1, 1], and has Q = 1 ‚àí x2. They can then be standardized into the Jacobi polynomials P_n^{(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta)}. There are several important subclasses of these: Gegenbauer, Legendre, and two types of Chebyshev. * Every Laguerre-like polynomial sequence can have its domain shifted, scaled, and/or reflected so that its interval of orthogonality is [0, \\\\infty), and has Q = x. They can then be standardized into the Associated Laguerre polynomials L_n^{(\\\\alpha)}. The plain Laguerre polynomials \\\\ L_n are a subclass of these. * Every Hermite- like polynomial sequence can have its domain shifted and/or scaled so that its interval of orthogonality is (-\\\\infty, \\\\infty), and has Q = 1 and L(0) = 0. They can then be standardized into the Hermite polynomials H_n. Because all polynomial sequences arising from a differential equation in the manner described above are trivially equivalent to the classical polynomials, the actual classical polynomials are always used. = Jacobi polynomial = The Jacobi-like polynomials, once they have had their domain shifted and scaled so that the interval of orthogonality is [‚àí1, 1], still have two parameters to be determined. They are \\\\alpha and \\\\beta in the Jacobi polynomials, written P_n^{(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta)}. We have Q(x) = 1-x^2 and L(x) = \\\\beta-\\\\alpha-(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta+2)\\\\, x. Both \\\\alpha and \\\\beta are required to be greater than ‚àí1\\\\. (This puts the root of L inside the interval of orthogonality.) When \\\\alpha and \\\\beta are not equal, these polynomials are not symmetrical about x = 0. The differential equation :(1-x^2)\\\\,y + (\\\\beta-\\\\alpha-[\\\\alpha+\\\\beta+2]\\\\,x)\\\\,y' + \\\\lambda \\\\,y = 0\\\\qquad \\\\text{with}\\\\qquad\\\\lambda = n(n+1+\\\\alpha+\\\\beta) is Jacobi's equation. For further details, see Jacobi polynomials. = Gegenbauer polynomials = When one sets the parameters \\\\alpha and \\\\beta in the Jacobi polynomials equal to each other, one obtains the Gegenbauer or ultraspherical polynomials. They are written C_n^{(\\\\alpha)}, and defined as :C_n^{(\\\\alpha)}(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(2\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\!+\\\\\\\\!n)\\\\,\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\!+\\\\\\\\!1/2)}{\\\\Gamma(2\\\\alpha) \\\\,\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\!+\\\\\\\\!n\\\\\\\\!+\\\\\\\\!1/2)}\\\\\\\\! \\\\ P_n^{(\\\\alpha-1/2, \\\\alpha-1/2)}(x). We have Q(x) = 1-x^2 and L(x) = -(2\\\\alpha+1)\\\\, x. The parameter \\\\alpha is required to be greater than ‚àí1/2. (Incidentally, the standardization given in the table below would make no sense for Œ± = 0 and n ‚â† 0, because it would set the polynomials to zero. In that case, the accepted standardization sets C_n^{(0)}(1) = \\\\frac{2}{n} instead of the value given in the table.) Ignoring the above considerations, the parameter \\\\alpha is closely related to the derivatives of C_n^{(\\\\alpha)}: :C_n^{(\\\\alpha+1)}(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\alpha}\\\\\\\\! \\\\ \\\\frac{d}{dx}C_{n+1}^{(\\\\alpha)}(x) or, more generally: :C_n^{(\\\\alpha+m)}(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha)}{2^m\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha+m)}\\\\\\\\! \\\\ C_{n+m}^{(\\\\alpha)[m]}(x). All the other classical Jacobi-like polynomials (Legendre, etc.) are special cases of the Gegenbauer polynomials, obtained by choosing a value of \\\\alpha and choosing a standardization. For further details, see Gegenbauer polynomials. = Legendre polynomials = The differential equation is :(1-x^2)\\\\,y - 2x\\\\,y' + \\\\lambda \\\\,y = 0\\\\qquad \\\\text{with}\\\\qquad\\\\lambda = n(n+1). This is Legendre's equation. The second form of the differential equation is: :\\\\frac{d}{dx}[(1-x^2)\\\\,y'] + \\\\lambda\\\\,y = 0. The recurrence relation is :(n+1)\\\\,P_{n+1}(x) = (2n+1)x\\\\,P_n(x) - n\\\\,P_{n-1}(x). A mixed recurrence is :P_{n+1}^{[r+1]}(x) = P_{n-1}^{[r+1]}(x) + (2n+1)\\\\,P_n^{[r]}(x). Rodrigues' formula is :P_n(x) = \\\\,\\\\frac{1}{2^n n!} \\\\ \\\\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\\\\left([x^2-1]^n\\\\right). For further details, see Legendre polynomials.  Associated Legendre polynomials  The Associated Legendre polynomials, denoted P_\\\\ell^{(m)}(x) where \\\\ell and m are integers with 0 \\\\leqslant m \\\\leqslant \\\\ell, are defined as :P_\\\\ell^{(m)}(x) = (-1)^m\\\\,(1-x^2)^{m/2}\\\\ P_\\\\ell^{[m]}(x). The m in parentheses (to avoid confusion with an exponent) is a parameter. The m in brackets denotes the m-th derivative of the Legendre polynomial. These \\"polynomials\\" are misnamed‚Äîthey are not polynomials when m is odd. They have a recurrence relation: :(\\\\ell+1-m)\\\\,P_{\\\\ell+1}^{(m)}(x) = (2\\\\ell+1)x\\\\,P_\\\\ell^{(m)}(x) - (\\\\ell+m)\\\\,P_{\\\\ell-1}^{(m)}(x). For fixed m, the sequence P_m^{(m)}, P_{m+1}^{(m)}, P_{m+2}^{(m)}, \\\\dots are orthogonal over [‚àí1, 1], with weight 1\\\\. For given m, P_\\\\ell^{(m)}(x) are the solutions of :(1-x^2)\\\\,y -2xy' + \\\\left[\\\\lambda - \\\\frac{m^2}{1-x^2}\\\\right]\\\\,y = 0\\\\qquad \\\\text{ with }\\\\qquad\\\\lambda = \\\\ell(\\\\ell+1). = Chebyshev polynomials = The differential equation is :(1-x^2)\\\\,y - x\\\\,y' + \\\\lambda \\\\,y = 0\\\\qquad \\\\text{with}\\\\qquad\\\\lambda = n^2. This is Chebyshev's equation. The recurrence relation is :T_{n+1}(x) = 2x\\\\,T_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x). Rodrigues' formula is :T_n(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(1/2)\\\\sqrt{1-x^2}}{(-2)^n\\\\,\\\\Gamma(n+1/2)} \\\\ \\\\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\\\\left([1-x^2]^{n-1/2}\\\\right). These polynomials have the property that, in the interval of orthogonality, :T_n(x) = \\\\cos(n\\\\,\\\\arccos(x)). (To prove it, use the recurrence formula.) This means that all their local minima and maxima have values of ‚àí1 and +1, that is, the polynomials are \\"level\\". Because of this, expansion of functions in terms of Chebyshev polynomials is sometimes used for polynomial approximations in computer math libraries. Some authors use versions of these polynomials that have been shifted so that the interval of orthogonality is [0, 1] or [‚àí2, 2]. There are also Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, denoted U_n We have: :U_n = \\\\frac{1}{n+1}\\\\,T_{n+1}'. For further details, including the expressions for the first few polynomials, see Chebyshev polynomials. = Laguerre polynomials = The most general Laguerre-like polynomials, after the domain has been shifted and scaled, are the Associated Laguerre polynomials (also called generalized Laguerre polynomials), denoted L_n^{(\\\\alpha)}. There is a parameter \\\\alpha, which can be any real number strictly greater than ‚àí1\\\\. The parameter is put in parentheses to avoid confusion with an exponent. The plain Laguerre polynomials are simply the \\\\alpha = 0 version of these: :L_n(x) = L_n^{(0)}(x). The differential equation is :x\\\\,y + (\\\\alpha + 1-x)\\\\,y' + \\\\lambda \\\\,y = 0\\\\text{ with }\\\\lambda = n. This is Laguerre's equation. The second form of the differential equation is :(x^{\\\\alpha+1}\\\\,e^{-x}\\\\, y')' + \\\\lambda \\\\,x^\\\\alpha \\\\,e^{-x}\\\\,y = 0. The recurrence relation is :(n+1)\\\\,L_{n+1}^{(\\\\alpha)}(x) = (2n+1+\\\\alpha-x)\\\\,L_n^{(\\\\alpha)}(x) - (n+\\\\alpha)\\\\,L_{n-1}^{(\\\\alpha)}(x). Rodrigues' formula is :L_n^{(\\\\alpha)}(x) = \\\\frac{x^{-\\\\alpha}e^x}{n!} \\\\ \\\\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\\\\left(x^{n+\\\\alpha}\\\\,e^{-x}\\\\right). The parameter \\\\alpha is closely related to the derivatives of L_n^{(\\\\alpha)}: :L_n^{(\\\\alpha+1)}(x) = - \\\\frac{d}{dx}L_{n+1}^{(\\\\alpha)}(x) or, more generally: :L_n^{(\\\\alpha+m)}(x) = (-1)^m L_{n+m}^{(\\\\alpha)[m]}(x). Laguerre's equation can be manipulated into a form that is more useful in applications: :u = x^{\\\\frac{\\\\alpha-1}{2}}e^{-x/2}L_n^{(\\\\alpha)}(x) is a solution of :u + \\\\frac{2}{x}\\\\,u' + \\\\left[\\\\frac \\\\lambda x - \\\\frac{1}{4} - \\\\frac{\\\\alpha^2-1}{4x^2}\\\\right]\\\\,u = 0\\\\text{ with } \\\\lambda = n+\\\\frac{\\\\alpha+1}{2}. This can be further manipulated. When \\\\ell = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha-1}{2} is an integer, and n \\\\ge \\\\ell+1: :u = x^\\\\ell e^{-x/2} L_{n-\\\\ell-1}^{(2\\\\ell+1)}(x) is a solution of :u + \\\\frac{2}{x}\\\\,u' + \\\\left[\\\\frac \\\\lambda x - \\\\frac{1}{4} - \\\\frac{\\\\ell(\\\\ell+1)}{x^2}\\\\right]\\\\,u = 0\\\\text{ with }\\\\lambda = n. The solution is often expressed in terms of derivatives instead of associated Laguerre polynomials: :u = x^{\\\\ell}e^{-x/2}L_{n+\\\\ell}^{[2\\\\ell+1]}(x). This equation arises in quantum mechanics, in the radial part of the solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation for a one-electron atom. Physicists often use a definition for the Laguerre polynomials that is larger, by a factor of (n!), than the definition used here. For further details, including the expressions for the first few polynomials, see Laguerre polynomials. = Hermite polynomials = The differential equation is :y - 2xy' + \\\\lambda \\\\,y = 0,\\\\qquad \\\\text{with}\\\\qquad\\\\lambda = 2n. This is Hermite's equation. The second form of the differential equation is :(e^{-x^2}\\\\,y')' + e^{-x^2}\\\\,\\\\lambda\\\\,y = 0. The third form is :(e^{-x^2/2}\\\\,y) + (\\\\lambda +1-x^2)(e^{-x^2/2}\\\\,y) = 0. The recurrence relation is :H_{n+1}(x) = 2x\\\\,H_n(x) - 2n\\\\,H_{n-1}(x). Rodrigues' formula is :H_n(x) = (-1)^n\\\\,e^{x^2} \\\\ \\\\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\\\\left(e^{-x^2}\\\\right). The first few Hermite polynomials are :H_0(x) = 1 :H_1(x) = 2x :H_2(x) = 4x^2-2 :H_3(x) = 8x^3-12x :H_4(x) = 16x^4-48x^2+12 One can define the associated Hermite functions : \\\\psi_n(x) = (h_n)^{-1/2}\\\\,e^{-x^2/2}H_n(x). Because the multiplier is proportional to the square root of the weight function, these functions are orthogonal over (-\\\\infty, \\\\infty) with no weight function. The third form of the differential equation above, for the associated Hermite functions, is :\\\\psi + (\\\\lambda +1-x^2)\\\\psi = 0. The associated Hermite functions arise in many areas of mathematics and physics. In quantum mechanics, they are the solutions of Schr√∂dinger's equation for the harmonic oscillator. They are also eigenfunctions (with eigenvalue (‚àíi n) of the continuous Fourier transform. Many authors, particularly probabilists, use an alternate definition of the Hermite polynomials, with a weight function of e^{-x^2/2} instead of e^{-x^2}. If the notation He is used for these Hermite polynomials, and H for those above, then these may be characterized by :He_n(x) = 2^{-n/2}\\\\,H_n\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\right). For further details, see Hermite polynomials. Characterizations of classical orthogonal polynomials There are several conditions that single out the classical orthogonal polynomials from the others. The first condition was found by Sonine (and later by Hahn), who showed that (up to linear changes of variable) the classical orthogonal polynomials are the only ones such that their derivatives are also orthogonal polynomials. Bochner characterized classical orthogonal polynomials in terms of their recurrence relations. Tricomi characterized classical orthogonal polynomials as those that have a certain analogue of the Rodrigues formula.

Obsidian is a naturally formed volcanic glass that was an important part of the material culture of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Obsidian was a highly integrated part of daily and ritual life, and its widespread and varied use may be a significant contributor to Mesoamerica's lack of metallurgy. Lithic and contextual analysis of obsidian, including source studies, are important components of archaeological studies of past Mesoamerican cultures and inform scholars on economy, technological organization, long-distance trade, ritual organization, and socio-cultural structure. Production techniques An obsidian prismatic blade fragment from the Maya site of Chunchucmil Due to its glassy internal structure, obsidian is relatively easy to work, as it breaks in very predictable and controlled ways via conchoidal fracturing. This contributed to its prolific use throughout Mesoamerica. It is obtained by either quarrying source sites or in nodule form from riverbeds or fractured outcrops. Following the removal of cortex (when applicable), bifacial, unifacial, and expedient flake stone tools could be produced through lithic reduction. The use of pecking, grinding, and carving techniques may also be employed to produce figurines, jewelry, eccentrics, or other types of objects. Prismatic blade production, a technique employing a pressure flaking-like technique that removed blades from a polyhedral core, was ubiquitous throughout Mesoamerica. Modern attempts to redesign production techniques are heavily based on Spanish records and accounts of witnessed obsidian knapping. Motolinia, a 16th-century Spanish observer, left this account of prismatic blade production: > It is in this manner: First they get out a knife stone (obsidian core) which > is black like jet and 20 cm or slightly less in length, and they make it > cylindrical and as thick as the calf of the leg, and they place the stone > between the feet, and with a stick apply force to the edges of the stone, > and at every push they give a little knife springs off with its edges like > those of a razor.\\"Hester et al. (1971) As the distribution of obsidian sources in Mesoamerica is generally limited, many areas and sites lacked a local obsidian source or direct access to one. As a result, tool curation through edge-rejuvenation and/or resharpening was commonly used on larger-mass tools, such as bifaces, to prolong the tool's (and the raw material's) utility. While prismatic blades were generally not curated (in the traditional sense) due to their small size, utility of the tools may have been maintained by changing their function. In other words, as the edge of a blade lost its sharpness after long-term use, the blade may have been used in scraping activities, which does not require a very sharp edge, than as a cutting implement. Other curation techniques of prismatic blades involve reshaping them into other tool types, such as projectile points and awls. Sources Map showing the locations of some of the main obsidian sources in Mesoamerica Obsidian sources in Mesoamerica are limited in number and distribution, and are restricted to the volcanic regions of the Sierra Madre Mountains as it runs through Mexico and Guatemala. These resources, however, are still quite abundant in the archaeological record and their origins can be traced by their physical and geological properties. Before discussing these obsidian sources, a definition of what an obsidian source is must be established, as many of the terms used allow for different and competing interpretations. Sidrys et al. (1976) stated that an obsidian source area includes several outcroppings of obsidian, limited in spatial extent, which may or may not have common chemical features and may or may not have been used by ancient humans. Michael D. Glascock, of the University of Missouri Research Reactor Center at the University of Missouri (which performs neutron activation analysis), has divided Mesoamerica into nine sub-regions with one or more obsidian sources in each. These subdivisions, while effective at systemizing the source characteristics and allowing for a more easily visualized distribution of sources, are still tentative.Glascock et al. (1998) They are as follows: *Zaragoza (includes the Zaragoza and Altotonga quarries), in the south-central Gulf lowlands of Mexico) *Orizaba (includes the Pico de Orizaba, Guadalupe Victoria, and Las Derrumbadas sources), in the south- central Gulf lowlands of Mexico *Paredon (Paredon and Santa Elena sources), in the central highlands of Mexico *Otumba (Otumba and Malpais), in the central highlands of Mexico *Tulancingo (Tulancingo and Tepalcingo), in the central highlands of Mexico *Pachuca (a number of different quarries), in the central highlands of Mexico *Zacualtipan (Zacualtipan, one source only), in the central highlands of Mexico *Ucareo (Ucareo and Zinap√©cuaro) ‚Äì largest source in west Mexico (in Michoac√°n). *The Guatemalan region ‚Äì which incorporates all sources located in the Guatemalan highlands. Tajumulco, El Chayal, Ixtepeque, and San Mart√≠n Jilotepeque are the best known obsidian sources in Guatemala and were commonly exploited in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. In fact, almost all Obsidian found in Olmec and Maya sites originates from these sources. Sources in the Valley of Mexico, which fell under Teotihuacan control during the Early Classic, were Pachuca, Otumba, and Chicoloapan. Obsidian from Pachuca is notable because of its unique green-gold color and its internal purity which makes it one of the highest quality obsidian sources in Mesoamerica. It was much sought after and widely traded. Green obsidian is also found in the area of Tulancingo, but is distinct from Pachuca obsidian because of its internal opacity (e.g., it is a more milky or clouded green). Substantial research has been carried out to decipher the Guatemala region sources. As mentioned earlier, the Guatemalan region includes the El Chayal, Ixtepeque, and San Martin Jilotepeque sources, located in southern/southeastern Guatemala. Obsidian originating from Guatemala was widely used in Mesoamerica and is found as far north as the Yucat√°n Peninsula, moving via a well-developed long- distance trade network that inter-connected much of the Maya area.Braswell and Glascock (1992) Newer and tentative additions to the Guatemalan source area are Jalapa and Sansare. However, the El Chayal area is often seen as subsuming these two into one large source area. The Pre Classic Monte Alto culture and the Olmecs also used the Tajumulco Volcano source, in the southwest of Guatemala, a source that was almost forgotten during the Classic and Post Classic periods. Analytical methods =Trace element analysis= Obsidian, a volcanic glass, comes from several geological sources in Mesoamerica, as listed above. Each of these sources has a distinctive ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù of trace elements that proportionally vary due to the individual circumstances of each source's formation. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) are two analytical methods used to identify the types and amounts of trace elements. These data are then statistically compared to data already available for the known sources. =Visual sourcing= Visual sourcing is the process by which the source of obsidian artifacts are determined by the analysis of not only their visual appearance (e.g., color, inclusions, etc.) but also their physical attributes, such as surface texture, light reflection, internal opacity, and so on. While not as reliable as trace element analysis, and completely dependent on the experience of the researcher, visual sourcing has a number of advantages. Primarily, it is a cheap method that allows for the analysis of an entire obsidian assemblage. This is in comparison to trace element analysis which, due to high costs, allows for the analysis of only a small sample, preferably one that is statistically representative. =Hydration dating= Obsidian hydration dating is a method that allows for the absolute or relative dating of an obsidian sample. The degree of hydration (i.e., water absorbed into the material) observed indicates how long it has been since the obsidian surface was exposed (i.e., through flaking). Obsidian hydration dating is at times, however, unreliable. The rate of hydration can vary tremendously depending on annual rainfall and humidity levels, among other factors, and how these have varied since the piece was first produced (or how they vary if the piece moved from one ecological zone to another). Due to the nature of the geological formation of obsidian, and the impact that each unique formation incidence has on the appearance and geochemical properties of each source, the material serves as an excellent medium by which long-distance trade can be studied. In performing trace-element or visual analyses, the origins of an artifact's material can be determined. It is clear that obsidian was a critical material in Precolumbian Mesoamerican economies; it is ubiquitous throughout the region, and found in the material record of all cultures and time periods. The low bulk of obsidian in transport, which therefore required less effort in trade, and the large quantity of useful items that could be produced from a small amount of material, greatly contributed to obsidian's widespread use. One example is the presence of Pachuca obsidian from central Mexico, where Mexico City is now, and ostensibly under the control of Teotihuacan, in the Maya area during the Early Classic. While the Maya had access to a number of local obsidian sources more readily available and (relatively) easily obtained, including El Chayal its main source, Pachuca obsidian remained an important trade good. The Olmec, from the Gulf coast likewise obtained its obsidian also from El Chayal in Guatemala (Andrews (1990: 13). It is unclear if trade for foreign obsidian contributed to the growth of Maya polities, or if it simply served as a mode for obtaining superior items or human labor. Generally, obsidian came into the Maya area via larger central places, such as Tikal, Uaxactun, and Palenque. Obsidian artifacts and tools were then redistributed to smaller and potentially dependent centers and communities. This is indicated by a lack of production debitage, including polyhedral cores, decortical flakes, and large percussion flakes, among rural occupations. Obsidian was generally transported, where applicable, along coastal trade routes. Of primary importance is the circum- peninsular trade route that linked the southeast Maya area to the Gulf coast of Mexico. Examples of evidence of this include the higher quantities of obsidian found among coastal sites, such as small island occupations off the coast of Belize, then at sites located in-land.See McKillop (1989; 1996) Use =Utilitarian= Obsidian, called itztli in the Nahuatl language, has been found at nearly every Mesoamerican archaeological site. Items made from this material had both utilitarian and ritual use. In many areas, it was available to all households regardless of socio-economic status, and was used in hunting, agriculture, food preparation, and for many other daily activities. Morphologically, obsidian was worked into a variety of tool forms, including knives, lance and projectile points, prismatic blades, general bifacial tools, and utilized flakes. Blades have been found in situ with rabbit, rodent, and mollusk remains, indicating their use in butchery. The practical use of obsidian is obvious considering that the material can be used to make some of the sharpest edges on earth.When skillfully worked, the edges of prismatic blade made from obsidian can reach the molecular level (i.e., the material has a cutting edge that is only one molecule thick). Baigent (1999). =Ideological= Obsidian was also used in a variety of non-utilitarian contexts. Objects made of obsidian were used as associated grave goods, employed in sacrifice (in whatever form), and in art. Some non-utilitarian forms include miniature human effigies, ear spools and labrets with gold and turquoise workings, carved animal figurines, beads, vases, and as pieces of masks. Obsidian was frequently used in ritualized autosacrifice (blood- letting) activities, serving as a substitute for stingray spines. Its association with that act of bloodletting is important, as it is argued by some researchersFor example see Evans (2004) that obsidian was seen as a type of blood originating from the earth ‚Äì its use in autosacrifice is therefore especially symbolic. Objects made of obsidian were often buried in upper class tombs as special deposits or caches. Obsidian debitage is found in many of these tombs in addition to evidence of its use in temple dedications, potlaching, or offerings. For example, flakes have been found in association with stelae offerings and related to specific gods at the Maya site of Tikal. Its ritualized use is not, however, restricted to high-status political and religious contexts, and it was clearly used within mundane domestic and household rituals. Representation in art and writing Most of the evidence that supports the many theories about obsidian use in Mesoamerica comes from the artwork of the region. This artwork is seen in many forms including the aforementioned obsidian figurines, ear spools, beads, and vases. Stele and large carvings, sculpture, and murals on architecture also depict obsidian. Typically, the material's visual depiction in artwork is generally associated with autosacrifice and other types of sacrifice, including images of prismatic blades with bloody hearts on the blade's ends. Unfortunately, the majority of the material record is out of context yet the implications and interpretations that are drawn from artwork are substantial and reflect a corpus of beliefs and ideology involving obsidian. Some of the more significant portrayals of obsidian use involve blood-letting and warfare. One example includes the macuahuitl, a broad‚Äìfaced club studded along its edges by obsidian prismatic blades. These weapons are predominantly used in ritual warfare and generally date to the Postclassic period. Earlier depictions of obsidian is usually restricted to their appearance as razors or lancets, and it is commonly believed that the material was not associated with weapons such as clubs or spears until later phases in Mesoamerica. In the Aztec writing system, a curved prismatic blade represents the phonetic value itz (Taube 1991) and results in the term itztli, as mentioned. Value Obsidian was widely distributed throughout Mesoamerica by trade. Its importance to Mesoamerican societies has been compared to the value and importance of steel to modern civilization. However, archaeology provides varied evidence of the individual value placed on obsidian. For example, during the Preclassic period, obsidian was a rare item in the lowland areas, found predominantly in high-status and ritual contexts. In many Maya excavations evidence of obsidian is likewise found most frequently in privileged settings. As the Late Classic period progressed, obsidian became increasingly accessible to the lower classes of Maya civilization. Nevertheless, the Maya upper classes continued to remain in possession of the more prestigious Teotihuacan green obsidian. In the Teotihuacan culture obsidian was perhaps traded at a loss of human effort in transport across long distances. The profit from the trade lay in prestigious high-status items received in return. Obsidian has both been seen as a key element to Teotihuacan's rise to power and as a side trade element that simply augmented their already developing wealth. Obsidian forms part of many high- status items, such as valuable ear-spools, but these obsidian ear-spools have also been discovered in exclusively lower-status settings. Thus the value of obsidian can be considered highly variable. It was an important trade item, but is found in a variety of environments, unlike many items whose ownership was confined to the upper classes. Finally, there is no indication that obsidian was used as a currency in Mesoamerica.

The Phrygian cap () or liberty cap is a soft conical cap with the apex bent over, associated in antiquity with several peoples in Eastern Europe and Anatolia, including Phrygia, Dacia, and the Balkans. In first the American Revolution and then French Revolution it came to signify freedom and the pursuit of liberty, although Phrygian caps did not originally function as liberty caps.Richard Wrigley, \\"Transformations of a revolutionary emblem: The Liberty Cap in the French Revolution, French History 11(2) 1997, p. 132. The original cap of liberty was the Roman pileus, the felt cap of manumitted (emancipated) slaves of ancient Rome, which was an attribute of Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty. In the 16th century, the Roman iconography of liberty was revived in emblem books and numismatic handbooks where the figure of Libertas is usually depicted with a pileus.Carol Louise Janson, ‚ÄúThe Birth of Dutch Liberty. Origins of the Pictorial Imagery‚Äù, Diss. phil. University of Minnesota 1982 (microfilm), p. 35. The most extensive use of a headgear as a symbol of freedom in the first two centuries after the revival of the Roman iconography was made in the Netherlands, where the cap of liberty was adopted in the form of a contemporary hat.ibd. p. 98. In the 18th century, the traditional liberty cap was widely used in English prints and from 1789 also in French prints; by the early 1790s, it was regularly used in the Phrygian form. It is used in the coat of arms of certain republics or of republican state institutions in the place where otherwise a crown would be used (in the heraldry of monarchies). It thus came to be identified as a symbol of republican government. A number of national personifications, in particular France's Marianne, are commonly depicted wearing the Phrygian cap. In antiquity =In the early Hellenistic world= By the 4th century BC (early Hellenistic period) the Phrygian cap was associated with Phrygian Attis, the consort of Cybele, the cult of which had by then become graecified. At around the same time, the cap appears in depictions of the legendary king Midas and other Phrygians in Greek vase-paintings and sculpture.Lynn E. Roller, \\"The Legend of Midas\\", Classical Antiquity, 2.2 (October 1983:299‚Äì313) p. 305. Such images predate the earliest surviving literary references to the cap. By extension, the Phrygian cap also came to be applied to several other non- Greek-speaking peoples (\\"barbarians\\" in the classical sense). Most notable of these extended senses of \\"Phrygian\\" were the Trojans and other western Anatolian peoples, who in Greek perception were synonymous with the Phrygians, and whose heroes Paris, Aeneas, and Ganymede were all regularly depicted with a Phrygian cap. Other Greek earthenware of antiquity also depict Amazons and so-called \\"Scythian\\" archers with Phrygian caps. Although these are military depictions, the headgear is distinguished from \\"Phrygian helmets\\" by long ear flaps, and the figures are also identified as \\"barbarians\\" by their trousers. The headgear also appears in 2nd-century BC Boeotian Tanagra figurines of an effeminate Eros, and in various 1st-century BC statuary of the Commagene, in eastern Anatolia. Greek representations of Thracians also regularly appear with Phrygian caps, most notably Bendis, the Thracian goddess of the moon and the hunt, and Orpheus, a legendary Thracian poet and musician. While the Phrygian cap was of wool or soft leather, in pre-Hellenistic times the Greeks had already developed a military helmet that had a similarly characteristic flipped-over tip. These so-called \\"Phrygian helmets\\" (named in modern times after the cap) were usually of bronze and in prominent use in Thrace, Dacia, Magna Graecia and the rest of the Hellenistic world from the 5th century BC up to Roman times. Due to their superficial similarity, the cap and helmet are often difficult to distinguish in Greek art (especially in black-figure or red-figure earthenware) unless the headgear is identified as a soft flexible cap by long earflaps or a long neck flap. Also confusingly similar are the depictions of the helmets used by cavalry and light infantry (cf. Peltasts of Thrace and Paeonia), whose headgear ‚Äì aside from the traditional alopekis caps of fox skin ‚Äì also included stiff leather helmets in imitation of the bronze ones. =In the Roman world= The Greek concept passed to the Romans in its extended sense, and thus encompassed not only to Phrygians or Trojans (which the Romans also generally associated with the term \\"Phrygian\\"), but also the other near-neighbours of the Greeks. On Trajan's Column, which commemorated Trajan's epic wars with the Dacians (101‚Äì102 and 105‚Äì106 AD), the Phrygian cap adorns the heads of Trajan's Dacian prisoners. The prisoner, accompanying Trajan in the monumental, 3 m tall statue of Trajan in the ancient city of Laodicea, is wearing a Phrygian Cap. Parthians appear with Phrygian caps in the 2nd-century Arch of Septimius Severus, which commemorates Roman victories over the Parthian Empire. Likewise with Phrygians caps, but for Gauls, appear in 2nd-century friezes built into the 4th century Arch of Constantine. The Phrygian cap reappears in figures related to the first to fourth century religion Mithraism. This astrology-centric Roman mystery cult (cultus) projected itself with pseudo-Oriental trappings (known as perserie in scholarship) in order to distinguish itself from both traditional Roman religion and from the other mystery cults. In the artwork of the cult (e.g. in the so-called \\"tauroctony\\" cult images), the figures of the god Mithras as well as those of his helpers Cautes and Cautopates are routinely depicted with a Phrygian cap. The function of the Phrygian cap in the cult are unknown, but it is conventionally identified as an accessory of its perserie. Early Christian art (and continuing well into the Middle Ages) build on the same Greco-Roman perceptions of (Pseudo-)Zoroaster and his \\"Magi\\" as experts in the arts of astrology and magic, and routinely depict the \\"three wise men\\" (that follow the Star of Bethlehem) with Phrygian caps. As a symbol of liberty The Dutch Maiden always carries her cap of liberty on a pole, and it is not of the Phrygian form. 1660 =From Phrygian to liberty cap= In late Republican Rome, a soft felt cap called the pileus served as a symbol of freemen (i.e. non-slaves), and was symbolically given to slaves upon manumission, thereby granting them not only their personal liberty, but also libertas‚Äî freedom as citizens, with the right to vote (if male). Following the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, Brutus and his co-conspirators instrumentalized this symbolism of the pileus to signify the end of Caesar's dictatorship and a return to the (Roman) republican system. Cf. Appian, Civil Wars 2:119: \\"The murderers wished to make a speech in the Senate, but as nobody remained there they wrapped their togas around their left arms to serve as shields, and, with swords still reeking with blood, ran, crying out that they had slain a king and tyrant. One of them bore a cap on the end of a spear as a symbol of freedom, and exhorted the people to restore the government of their fathers and recall the memory of the elder Brutus and of those who took the oath together against ancient kings.\\" These Roman associations of the pileus with liberty and republicanism were carried forward to the 18th-century, when the pileus was confused with the Phrygian cap, with the Phrygian cap then becoming a symbol of those values.. =France's bonnet rouge= French revolutionaries wearing bonnets rouges and tricolor cockades. In this 1793 British cartoon by James Gillray, who was deeply hostile to the French Revolution, a Phrygian cap substitutes for Scylla atop the dangerous \\"Rock of Democracy\\", as Britannia's boat (Constitution) navigates between Scylla's rock and Charybdis, the \\"Whirlpool of Arbitrary-Power\\", pursued by Scylla's \\"dogs\\": Sheridan, Fox, and Priestley, depicted as sharks. ; In revolutionary France In 1675, the anti-tax and anti-nobility Stamp-Paper revolt erupted in Brittany and north-western France, where it became known as the bonnets rouges uprising after the blue or red caps worn by the insurgents. Although the insurgents are not known to have preferred any particular style of cap, the name and color stuck as a symbol of revolt against the nobility and establishment. Robespierre would later object to the color, but was ignored. The use of a Phrygian-style cap as a symbol of revolutionary France is first documented in May 1790, at a festival in Troyes adorning a statue representing the nation, and at Lyon, on a lance carried by the goddess Libertas.Albert Mathiez, Les Origines des cultures r√©volutionnaires, 1789‚Äì1792 (Paris 1904:34). To this day the national allegory of France, Marianne, is shown wearing a red Phrygian cap.Richard Wrigley, \\"Transformations of a revolutionary emblem: The Liberty Cap in the French Revolution, French History 11(2) 1997:131‚Äì169. By wearing the bonnet rouge and sans-culottes (\\"without silk breeches\\"), the Parisian working class made their revolutionary ardor and plebeian solidarity immediately recognizable. By mid-1791, these mocking fashion statements included the bonnet rouge as Parisian hairstyle, proclaimed by the Marquis de Villette (12 July 1791) as \\"the civic crown of the free man and French regeneration.\\" On 15 July 1792, seeking to suppress the frivolity, Fran√ßois Christophe Kellermann, 1st Duc de Valmy, published an essay in which the Duke sought to establish the bonnet rouge as a sacred symbol that could only be worn by those with merit. The symbolic hairstyle became a rallying point and a way to mock the elaborate wigs of the aristocrats and the red caps of the bishops. On 6 November 1793, the Paris city council declared it the official hairstyle of all its members. The bonnet rouge on a spear was proposed as a component of the national seal on 22 September 1792 during the third session of the National Convention. Following a suggestion by Gaan Coulon, the Convention decreed that convicts would not be permitted to wear the red cap, as it was consecrated as the badge of citizenship and freedom. In 1792, when Louis XVI was induced to sign a constitution, popular prints of the king were doctored to show him wearing the bonnet rouge.Jennifer Harris, \\"The Red Cap of Liberty: A Study of Dress Worn by French Revolutionary Partisans 1789-94\\" Eighteenth-Century Studies 14.3 (Spring 1981:283‚Äì312), fig. 1. Most of the details that follow are drawn from here. The bust of Voltaire was crowned with the red bonnet of liberty after a performance of his Brutus at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in March 1792. During the period of the Reign of Terror (September 1793 ‚Äì July 1794), the cap was adopted defensively even by those who might be denounced as moderates or aristocrats and were especially keen to advertise their adherence to the new regime. The caps were often knitted by women known as tricoteuses, who sat beside the guillotine during public executions in Paris and supposedly continued knitting in between executions.. The spire of Strasbourg Cathedral was crowned with a bonnet rouge in order to prevent it from being torn down in 1794. ; During the Restoration In 1814, the Acte de d√©ch√©ance de l'Empereur decision formally deposed the Bonapartes and restored the Bourbon regime, who in turn proscribed the bonnet rouge, La Marseillaise and Bastille Day celebrations. The symbols reappeared briefly in March‚ÄìJuly 1815 during \\"Napoleon's Hundred Days\\", but were immediately suppressed again following the second restoration of Louis XVIII on 8 July 1815. The symbols resurfaced again during the July Revolution of 1830, after which they were reinstated by the liberal July Monarchy of Louis Philippe I, and the revolutionary symbolsanthem, holiday, and bonnet rougebecame \\"constituent parts of a national heritage consecrated by the state and embraced by the public.\\" ; In modern France The republican associations with the bonnet rouge were adopted as the name and emblem of a French satirical republican and anarchist periodical published between 1913 and 1922 by Miguel Almereyda that targeted the Action fran√ßaise, a royalist, counter-revolutionary movement on the extreme right. The anti-tax associations with the bonnet rouge were revived in October 2013, when a French tax-protest movement called the Bonnets Rouges used the red revolution-era Phrygian cap as a protest symbol. By means of large demonstrations and direct action, which included the destruction of many highway tax portals, the movement successfully forced the French government to rescind the tax. =In the United States= Seal of the U.S. Senate The 1783 Libertas Americana medal, initiated and designed by Benjamin Franklin, honors the American Revolution and depicts the goddess of Liberty carrying a Phrygian cap In the 18th century, the cap was often used in English political prints as an attribute of Liberty. In the years just prior to the American Revolutionary War of independence from Great Britain, Americans copied or emulated some of those prints in an attempt to visually defend their inherited liberties as Englishmen. Later, the symbol of republicanism and anti-monarchial sentiment appeared in the United States as headgear of Columbia,, at pp. 12, 15‚Äì16. who in turn was visualized as a goddess-like female national personification of the United States and of Liberty herself. The cap reappears in association with Columbia in the early years of the republic, for example, on the obverse of the 1785 Immune Columbia pattern coin, which shows the goddess with a helmet seated on a globe holding in a right hand a furled U.S. flag topped by the liberty cap. Starting in 1793, U.S. coinage frequently showed Columbia/Liberty wearing the cap. The anti-federalist movement likewise instrumentalized the figure, as in a cartoon from 1796 in which Columbia is overwhelmed by a huge American eagle holding a Liberty Pole under its wings. The cap's last appearance on circulating coinage was the Walking Liberty Half Dollar, which was minted through 1947 (and reused on the current bullion American Silver Eagle). The U.S. Army has, since 1778, utilized a \\"War Office Seal\\" in which the motto \\"This We'll Defend\\" is displayed directly over a Phrygian cap on an upturned sword. It also appears on the state flags of West Virginia and Idaho (as part of their official seals), New Jersey, and New York, as well as the official seal of the United States Senate, the state of Iowa, the state of North Carolina (as well as the arms of its Senate,) and on the reverse side of the Seal of Virginia. In 1854, when sculptor Thomas Crawford was preparing models for sculpture for the United States Capitol, Secretary of War Jefferson Davis insisted that a Phrygian cap not be included on a Statue of Freedom, on the grounds that \\"American liberty is original and not the liberty of the freed slave\\". The cap was not included in the final bronze version that is now in the building.Gale, Robert L. (1964), Thomas Crawford: American Sculptor, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, p. 124. =In Latin America= The coat of arms of Haiti includes a Phrygian cap on top of a palm tree, commemorating that country's foundation in a slave revolt. Coat of arms of Argentina includes a Phrygian cap under a stick being held by two arms, as a symbol of national unity and freedom. Coat of arms of Colombia includes a Phrygian cap as a symbol of liberty and freedom. Many of the anti-colonial revolutions in Latin America were heavily inspired by the imagery and slogans of the American and French Revolutions. As a result, the cap has appeared on the coats of arms of many Latin American nations. The coat of arms of Haiti includes a Phrygian cap to commemorate that country's foundation by rebellious slaves. The cap had also been displayed on certain Mexican coins (most notably the old 8-reales coin) through the late 19th century into the mid-20th century. Today, it is featured on the coats of arms or national flags of Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Paraguay.

Early life and education Mac Lane was born in Norwich, Connecticut, near where his family lived in Taftville.. He was christened \\"Leslie Saunders MacLane\\", but \\"Leslie\\" fell into disuse because his parents, Donald MacLane and Winifred Saunders, came to dislike it. He began inserting a space into his surname because his first wife found it difficult to type the name without a space.Mac Lane (2005), p. 6. He was the oldest of three brothers; one of his brothers, Gerald MacLane, also became a mathematics professor at Rice University and Purdue University. Another sister died as a baby. His father and grandfather were both ministers; his grandfather had been a Presbyterian, but was kicked out of the church for believing in evolution, and his father was a Congregationalist. His mother, Winifred, studied at Mount Holyoke College and taught English, Latin, and mathematics. In high school, Mac Lane's favorite subject was chemistry. While in high school, his father died, and he came under his grandfather's care. His half-uncle, a lawyer, was determined to send him to Yale University, where many of his relatives had been educated, and paid his way there beginning in 1926. As a freshman, he became disillusioned with chemistry. His mathematics instructor, Lester S. Hill, coached him for a local mathematics competition which he won, setting the direction for his future work. He went on to study mathematics and physics as a double major, taking courses from Jesse Beams, Ernest William Brown, Ernest Lawrence, F. S. C. Northrop, and √òystein Ore, among others. He graduated from Yale with a B.A. in 1930. During this period, he published his first scientific paper, in physics and co-authored with Irving Langmuir. In 1929, at a party of Yale football supporters in Montclair, New Jersey, Mac Lane (there to be presented with a prize for having the best grade point average yet recorded at Yale) had met Robert Maynard Hutchins, the new president of the University of Chicago, who encouraged him to go there for his graduate studies and soon afterwards offered him a scholarship. Mac Lane neglected to actually apply to the program, but showed up and was admitted anyway. At Chicago, the subjects he studied included set theory with E. H. Moore, number theory with Leonard Eugene Dickson, the calculus of variations with Gilbert Ames Bliss, and logic with Mortimer J. Adler. In 1931, having earned his master's degree and feeling restless at Chicago, he earned a fellowship from the Institute of International Education and became one of the last Americans to study at the University of G√∂ttingen prior to its decline under the Nazis. His greatest influences there were Paul Bernays and Hermann Weyl. By the time he finished his doctorate in 1934, Bernays had been forced to leave because he was Jewish, and Weyl became his main examiner. At G√∂ttingen, Mac Lane also studied with Gustav Herglotz and Emmy Noether. Within days of finishing his degree, he married Dorothy Jones, from Chicago, and soon returned to the U.S. Career From 1934 through 1938, Mac Lane held short term appointments at Yale University, Harvard University, Cornell University, and the University of Chicago. He then held a tenure track appointment at Harvard from 1938 to 1947. In 1941, while giving a series of visiting lectures at the University of Michigan, he met Samuel Eilenberg and began what would become a fruitful collaboration on the interplay between algebra and topology. In 1944 and 1945, he also directed Columbia University's Applied Mathematics Group, which was involved in the war effort as a contractor for the Applied Mathematics Panel; the mathematics he worked on in this group concerned differential equations for fire-control systems. In 1947, he accepted an offer to return to Chicago, where (in part because of the university's involvement in the Manhattan Project, and in part because of the administrative efforts of Marshall Stone) many other famous mathematicians and physicists had also recently moved. He traveled as a Guggenheim Fellow to ETH Zurich for the 1947‚Äì1948 term, where he worked with Heinz Hopf. Mac Lane succeeded Stone as department chair in 1952, and served for six years. Mac Lane was vice president of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, and president of the American Mathematical Society. While presiding over the Mathematical Association of America in the 1950s, he initiated its activities aimed at improving the teaching of modern mathematics. He was a member of the National Science Board, 1974‚Äì1980, advising the American government. In 1976, he led a delegation of mathematicians to China to study the conditions affecting mathematics there. Mac Lane was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1949, and received the National Medal of Science in 1989. Contributions After a thesis in mathematical logic, his early work was in field theory and valuation theory. He wrote on valuation rings and Witt vectors, and separability in infinite field extensions. He started writing on group extensions in 1942, and in 1943 began his research on what are now called Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane spaces K(G,n), having a single non-trivial homotopy group G in dimension n. This work opened the way to group cohomology in general. After introducing, via the Eilenberg‚ÄìSteenrod axioms, the abstract approach to homology theory, he and Eilenberg originated category theory in 1945. He is especially known for his work on coherence theorems. A recurring feature of category theory, abstract algebra, and of some other mathematics as well, is the use of diagrams, consisting of arrows (morphisms) linking objects, such as products and coproducts. According to McLarty (2005), this diagrammatic approach to contemporary mathematics largely stems from Mac Lane (1948). Mac Lane also coined the term Yoneda lemma for a lemma which is an essential background to many central concepts of category theory and which was discovered by Nobuo Yoneda. Mac Lane had an exemplary devotion to writing approachable texts, starting with his very influential A Survey of Modern Algebra, coauthored in 1941 with Garrett Birkhoff. From then on, it was possible to teach elementary modern algebra to undergraduates using an English text. His Categories for the Working Mathematician remains the definitive introduction to category theory. Mac Lane supervised the Ph.Ds of, among many others, David Eisenbud, William Howard, Irving Kaplansky, Michael Morley, Anil Nerode, Robert Solovay, and John G. Thompson. In addition to reviewing a fair amount of his mathematical output, the obituary articles McLarty (2005, 2007) clarify Mac Lane's contributions to the philosophy of mathematics. Mac Lane (1986) is an approachable introduction to his views on this subject. Selected works * 1997 (1941). A Survey of Modern Algebra (with Garrett Birkhoff).

He emerged at the time of the New Culture Movement of the early 20th century and continued to be active until the Cultural Revolution, when he was attacked and died in jail before being posthumously rehabilitated by the Chinese authorities in 1979. He is considered by drama historians as one of the three founders of Chinese spoken drama, together with Ouyang Yuqian and Hong Shen. His most famous legacy may be the lyrics he wrote for \\"March of the Volunteers\\" in 1934, which were later adopted as the national anthem of the People's Republic of China.\\"Tian Han\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online (Accessed 16 Feb. 2015) Biography Tian Han (right) and Nie Er (left), respectively the lyricist and the composer of \\"March of the Volunteers\\", photographed in Shanghai in 1933 During the May Fourth Movement in 1919, Tian became famous for the vigorous anti-imperialist and anti-feudalist activities in the circle of artists and intellectuals he gathered. Tian was educated at Tokyo Higher Normal School (present-day University of Tsukuba) in Japan. Returning from Japan in 1921, Tian established the Creation Society together with Guo Moruo. The Southern China Society, also headed by Tian, played a leading role in promoting dramatic performances in southern China. In 1927, Tian taught at the Department of Literature of Shanghai Art University. Later, he joined The League of Chinese Left-Wing Dramatists. In 1934, he collaborated with the activist Liu Liangmo on the patriotic anthem, March of the Volunteers. Tian used various aliases and pen names including his courtesy name Ti√°n Sh√≤uchƒÅng (), B√≥h√≥ng (), Ch√©n Y√∫ (), Sh√πr√©n (), and H√†nxiƒÅn (). Tian, then Chairman of the Union of Chinese Drama Workers and Vice-Chairman of the All China's Federation of Literary and Art Circles, was attacked in 1966 for his historical play Xie Yaohuan (1961), regarded as an attack on Chairman Mao's policies and the CCP leadership. Criticism of this play, along with two other historical plays (Hai Rui Dismissed from Office by Wu Han and Li Huiniang by Meng Chao), were the opening salvos of the Cultural Revolution. Tian was denounced in a 1 February 1966 People's Daily article entitled \\"Xie Yaohuan is a Big Poisonous Weed\\" (Áî∞Ê±âÁöÑ„ÄäË∞¢Áë∂ÁéØ„ÄãÊòØ‰∏ÄÊ£µÂ§ßÊØíËçâ Ti√°n H√†n de Xi√® Y√°ohu√°n Sh√¨ yƒ´ kƒì D√† D√∫c«éo). The Jiefang Daily called Xie Yaohuan a \\"political manifesto\\". Guilty, among other things, of \\"wholesale inheritance of China's theatrical legacy and promoting traditional plays\\", \\"disparaging revolutionary modern plays\\" and \\"promoting bourgeois class liberalism and obfuscating the direction for the workers, peasants and soldiers\\", Tian was incarcerated as a \\"counterrevolutionary\\" in a prison run personally by Kang Sheng, and died there in 1968. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, he and Xie Yaohuan were rehabilitated posthumously in 1979.

The organization was founded by J. Frank Norris (1877‚Äì1952) of Texas, a southern fundamentalist leader in the first half of the 20th century.  History  The Fundamentals was a series of twelve 128-page booklets defending the 'fundamentals' of the faith, such as the inerrancy of the Bible, the virgin birth of Christ and the literal return of Christ. In 1920 Curtis Lee Laws, a Baptist editor of The Watchman-Examiner, coined the term 'fundamentalist' and defined a fundamentalist as one \\"ready to do battle royal for the Fundamentals of the faith.\\" J. Frank Norris became a combatant in the fundamentalist/modernist controversy. He edited a paper entitled The Fundamentalist. Both the Southern Baptist Convention and the Baptist General Convention of Texas expelled Norris because of his controversial behavior. Norris, C. P. Staley and others formed the Premillennial Missionary Baptist Fellowship in 1933 at Fort Worth, Texas. In 1938, the name was changed to World Fundamental Baptist Missionary Fellowship and then to World Baptist Fellowship (WBF) after the schism that created the Baptist Bible Fellowship International in 1950. The WBF was again divided in 1984, when a group led by Raymond W. Barber established the Independent Baptist Fellowship International and the Norris Bible Baptist Institute. Organization and purpose The WBF considers itself a missions agency. Its missionary work is headed by the Mission Committee, whose members are nominated by the existing committee and approved by the General Assembly in annual meeting. In 2003, the WBF had 85 approved missionaries. National Fellowship meetings are held twice per year. The organization is headquartered in Arlington, Texas, on the campus of Arlington Baptist University (an accredited Bible College, which is the organization's educational arm). The World Baptist Fellowship had 945 churches in 1995, with its primary strength in Texas, Florida and Ohio. More than half of these churches also participate in other independent fundamental Baptist fellowships.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the magazine printed monthly and was marketed mainly to women, although it had a significant gay male readership. The magazine was founded in 1973 by Douglas Lambert during the height of the feminist movement as a response to erotic men's magazines such as Playboy and Penthouse that featured similar photos of women. In 1977 Lambert sold Playgirl to Ira Ritter who took over as publisher. The magazine covered issues like abortion, equal rights, interspersed with sexy shots of men, and played a pivotal role in the sexual revolution for women.Cara Buckley They couldn‚Äôt get past the ‚ÄòMimbos‚Äô The New York Times, November 14, 2008. From March 2009 to February 2010, Playgirl appeared only online. The magazine returned to print as a sometime quarterly beginning with its March 2010 issue. The final print issue was Winter 2016. As of 2016, the magazine was believed to have had only approximately 3,000 subscribers. History Playgirl from inception to recent years was intended to be a women's magazine and an outlet for women to explore their sexuality (very similar to the popular men's magazine Playboy), purportedly an expression of sexual equality in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During its height, publisher Ira Ritter took the magazine to an even more sophisticated arena that included political articles to strengthen the editorial content, and featured influential figures of that time. However, over the course of the last 30 years, Playgirl faced adversity and many obstacles of opposing opinions in the media that ranged from feminist sex wars to pornography, prostitution, and lesbian politics.Roberts, C.L. (2011). Consuming Liberation: Playgirl and the Strategic Rhetoric of Sex Magazines For Women 1972-1985. (Doctoral dissertation). Graduate College of Bowling Green State University, Ohio. The magazine was published by Drake Publishers, Inc. until 1993 when Drake was merged into Crescent Publishing Group, Inc. In August 2000 Crescent was charged by the Federal Trade Commission with over $180 million of online credit card fraud, much of which was alleged by the FTC to have taken place on the Playgirl.com website.Playgirl Web Site Faces FTC Charges Federal Trade Commission, August 23, 2000. In November 2001 for one of the then largest FTC settlements involving online credit card fraud, Crescent agreed to pay $30 million in refunds to settle charges of online credit card fraud and also agreed to post a $2-million bond before it could continue to operate its websites. As a further condition for the settlement Crescent principals Bruce A. Chew and David Bernstein were barred by the FTC from operating adult entertainment websites unless first posting bonds of $500,000 each. In December 2001 Crescent Publishing Group, Inc. changed its name to Blue Horizon Media, Inc. Following the FTC settlement, in 2003 then Crescent/Blue Horizon president Bruce Chew was indicted, along with alleged organized-crime figure Richard Martino and others on federal charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, credit-card fraud and money laundering for illegally billing web users including for the Playgirl website. Pursuant to a plea deal Chew would later agree to testify for the government and against various of his co-defendants. In August 2008, the magazine announced that it would cease publication of its print edition as of the January 2009 issue. After that point, the magazine planned to continue with an online-only edition.Rafat Ali, \\"Playboy Enterprises Shutting Down Playgirl Mag; Online Only\\" , CBS News, August 3, 2008. The last print issue was published in January/February 2009. In February 2010, Playgirl announced it would re-launch issuing a print edition of the magazine. The first such issue would be the March 2010 issue available on newsstands as of February 22, 2010 carrying on its cover Levi Johnston, shot by longtime Playgirl photographer Greg Weiner.David Caplan Finally! Levi Johnston's Playgirl cover revealed People magazine, February 8, 2010. The magazine was issued approximately quarterly after that time. Playgirl was published by New York City-based company Blue Horizon Media, Inc. until April 25, 2011 when Blue Horizon sold the print rights for Playgirl together with those of its other titles ‚Äì High Society, Cheri, Black Diamond, Finally Legal, and Purely 18 ‚Äì to Magna Publishing Group, Inc. of Paramus, New Jersey.

Target markets The magazine is mainly marketed to heterosexual women. Despite this, in 2003, Playgirl's then-editor-in-chief Michele Zipp admitted the magazine also attracted much gay readership. \\"It's 'Entertainment for Women' because there's no other magazine out there that caters to women in the way we do\\", she said. But she went on adding: \\"We love our gay readers as well, and the gay readership [of the magazine] is about 30%.\\"Michael Rowe, \\"Great Scott: After years of struggling with his sexuality, Playgirl centerfold Scott Merritt is coming all the way out.

Thomas Umstead, \\"A 'Playgirl' for Adult TV,\\" Multichannel News, 17 November 2003. Contents Throughout the history of the magazine, Playgirl has featured male frontal nudity except for the early issues in 1973, and 1987 when John Paul became the year's first full frontal centerfold in November after ten months of non-nude photo spreads. Apart from professional models, Playgirl features amateur models in a section called Real Men (formerly known as Snapshots). A Real Men of the Year contest is held, in which readers can vote for the best layout of the year. In June of every year, Playgirl has its \\"Man of the Year\\" issue. In July, it is the \\"Country\\" issue and in November, Playgirl dedicates an issue to \\"Campus Hunks.\\" A nude centerfold calendar featuring the men of the previous year is usually included in the December or January issue of the magazine. Readers are asked to vote for the \\"Man of the Year\\" from the pictures of the calendar. The magazine is well known for two major publicity stunts ‚Äî one for offering Charles, Prince of Wales $45,000 to appear nude in a centerfold in 1990, and another for publishing a nude pictorial called \\"The Men of Enron\\" in its September 2002 issue in which some former Enron employees \\"lost their shirts.\\" Researchers Richard A. Leit, Harrison G. Pope, Jr. and James J. Gray, in a 2000 paper published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders, examined 115 male centerfold models in Playgirl magazine from 1973 to 1997 and noted that the Playgirl centerfold models have become increasingly more muscular over time.Richard A. Leit, Harrison G. Pope, Jr. and James J. Gray, \\"Cultural expectations of muscularity in men: The evolution of Playgirl centerfolds,\\" International Journal of Eating Disorders, Vol. 29, Issue 1 (December 19, 2000), pp. 90-93.

Playgirl UK's brief 2011 relaunch was accompanied by an announcement that it would feature no below-the-waist nudity, and would focus on attractive male celebrities rather than models and pornography actors. It was a failure, and ceased circulation soon after it began. A Spanish-language edition was published in 1992‚Äì1993. Celebrity nudes Playgirl has a monthly section entitled \\"Celeb Nudes\\" featuring photographs of various celebrities from movie scenes, usually nude, but not always. Man of the Month (centerfold) Two preview issues of Playgirl were published with racecar driver Mike Hiss in the January 1973 issue; and the Hager Twins, Jim and John, from TV's Hee Haw in the February 1973 issue. Then Vol. 1, No. 1 appeared in June 1973, featuring Lyle Waggoner as the centerfold. Other early centerfolds included George Maharis, Fabian Forte, Peter Lupus and professional athlete Jim Brown.

Yount (; nicknamed,\\"The Kid\\", and \\"Rockin' Robin\\", born September 16, 1955) is an American former professional baseball player. He spent his entire 20-year career in Major League Baseball as a shortstop and center fielder for the Milwaukee Brewers (1974‚Äì93). After being drafted in 1973, Yount advanced to the major leagues just one year later at the age of 18. He won two American League Most Valuable Player awards. In 1982, he led the Brewers to a World Series appearance. Yount was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999 in his first year of eligibility. Since his retirement as a player, he has held several roles as a baseball coach. Early life Yount was born in Danville, Illinois. He lived briefly in Covington, Indiana, but his family moved to southern California when he was an infant; his father had gotten a job testing rocket engines with Rocketdyne. Robin attended William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills. Playing career =Early years= Yount was the third pick overall in the June 1973 Major League Baseball draft, one slot ahead of fellow Hall of Famer and 3,000 hit club member Dave Winfield. Yount made his major league debut the following April, at 18 years old. After going hitless in his first four games, Yount hit a game-winning home run in his sixth. Yount is currently the last 18-year-old to hit a home run in the Major Leagues (Andruw Jones, Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, and Juan Soto are the most recent teenagers to have hit Major League home runs, but did so as 19-year-olds). On September 14, 1975 (two days before his 20th birthday), Yount broke Mel Ott's 47-year-old record for most games played in the major leagues before turning 20. Yount courted controversy in the winter of 1978. He threatened to retire from the game and take up professional golf rather than be underpaid or moved to the outfield by the Brewers. Early in the season, Paul Molitor was called up from the Brewers Class A affiliate to the major league team because of Yount's absence. Yount's demands were met; when he returned to the team, Molitor was moved from shortstop to second base to make room for Yount. He was an early proponent of weight training ‚Äì then uncommon in baseball ‚Äì and by 1980 Yount's power hitting had improved, particularly for a shortstop. Yount was an All-Star in 1980, 1982, and 1983. No other Brewer was voted a starter in consecutive years until Ryan Braun started each year between 2008 and 2011.Wagner, Andrew (July 5, 2009). \\"Meet them in St. Louis: Fielder, Braun are All-Stars,\\" OnMilwaukee.com, accessed July 5, 2009 =1982 season= Robin Yount signed baseball circa 1984 Yount led the American League with 210 hits in 1982. The 1982 AL East race was tied on the final day of the season, with the race coming down to a winner-take-all game between the Brewers and the Baltimore Orioles. With the title on the line, Yount hit home runs in each of his first two at-bats against Orioles starter Jim Palmer. Yount finished with a four-hit game, as the Brewers won 10-2. In addition to his only 200-hit season, he registered career highs with 29 home runs, 114 RBI, and a .331 batting average (.001 behind the league leader, Willie Wilson). Yount finished with a .578 slugging percentage and .957 OPS on his way to gaining 367 total bases ‚Äì leading the major leagues in all three categories. His slugging percentage was the second highest ever by a shortstop, and his 129 runs set the record for that position. That year, Yount also won his only Gold Glove Award and his first Most Valuable Player Award. His performance garnered 27 of 28 possible first place votes in the 1982 MVP balloting. The year ended with the Brewers making their only World Series appearance. Although Yount became the only player in history to have two 4-hit games in one World Series, Milwaukee lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. Yount batted .414 in the Series, with one home run and 6 RBI. =Later career= In 1985, a shoulder problem forced Yount to move to the outfield. After splitting time between center field and left field, Yount became the Brewers' regular center fielder in 1986. He played more than 1,200 games in the outfield in his career, with a .990 fielding percentage. He made a game-ending, diving catch to preserve a no-hitter by Juan Nieves early in the 1987 season. Yount narrowly won a second MVP Award in 1989, making him only the third player to win MVPs at two positions, joining Hank Greenberg and Stan Musial (Alex Rodriguez would later join this group). Yount was the first AL player to win multiple MVP's in over 25 years, since the Yankees' Roger Maris (1960 & 1961) and Mickey Mantle (1956, 1957, and 1962). Yount collected more hits (1731) in the decade of the 1980s than any other player. After the 1989 season, Yount was a free agent and he spoke with several teams about contract offers. The California Angels were prepared to make a serious offer, but Yount signed a three-year contract with the Brewers worth $9.6 million in February 1990. In 1991, Yount was briefly on the disabled list (DL) with a kidney stone, only the second stint on the DL in his career; the first one was in 1978. On September 9, 1992, Yount collected his 3,000th career hit, becoming the 17th player (and the third-youngest) to reach the mark. He announced his retirement after the 1993 season. The Brewers retired his number the next year. Yount was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999, his first year of eligibility. That same year, he was included in the balloting for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, finishing fifth among shortstops. Yount holds Brewers career records for games, at-bats, runs, hits, doubles, triples, RBIs, total bases, walks and strikeouts. He was the last active major leaguer to have been a teammate of Hank Aaron (1975‚Äì1976). He posted a career .285 batting average with 251 home runs, 1,632 runs scored and 1,406 runs batted in. His 11,008 career at-bats is the seventh-most in Major League Baseball history, and he ranks 17th on the all-time hit list. His three All-Star appearances are tied with Ferguson Jenkins for the second-fewest of any Hall of Famer from the All-Star Game era, and he won a second MVP Award in 1989 without making the All-Star Team. Coaching career Yount served as first base coach and bench coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks from 2002 to 2004. He resigned after the dismissal of Arizona manager Bob Brenly. He, Hank Aaron, Warren Spahn and Bob Uecker threw out the ceremonial first pitches at the 2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Miller Park. In 2005, Brewers manager Ned Yost convinced Dale Sveum, a teammate of Yount's, to become Milwaukee's new third base coach. Yount followed suit a few weeks later, accepting a post as the Brewers' bench coach. In November 2006, Yount announced he would not return to the team as bench coach for the 2007 season. However, on September 15, 2008, Sveum, by now the team's manager, chose Yount as his bench coach. In 2012, when Sveum was named the Chicago Cubs new manager, rumors quickly spread that Sveum would ask Yount to coach with him, even though the Brewers and Cubs had become bitter rivals. Sveum very quickly confirmed that he was not even considering such a move. As of 2014, Yount is a special instructor in spring training for the Brewers. Personal life Yount in 2008 Yount met his wife Michele at Taft High School and they have been married since 1979. Yount's brother Larry was a pitcher and was briefly called up to play in the major leagues. While taking his warmup tosses for his debut as a Houston Astros reliever in 1971, he experienced elbow pain.https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU197109150.shtml He never threw an official pitch in any MLB game. Yount's son Dustin played baseball in the minor leagues for several years. Yount's nephew Austin Yount played professional baseball for the Dodgers organization. Another nephew, Cody Yount, played college baseball for Pepperdine University. Since retiring from baseball, Yount has increased his participation in two of his other passions, professional motorcycle and auto racing. In June 2008, Yount announced the creation of a new all-natural lemonade drink, Robinade. A portion of the proceeds of the sales goes to charity. Yount sometimes goes hunting with Sveum. While hunting in Arizona in 2012, Yount accidentally shot Sveum with pellets in the back and ear. Sveum's injuries were minor. In 2012, Yount became a minority owner of the Lakeshore Chinooks of the Northwoods League, a collegiate summer baseball league. The Chinooks play at Kapco Park at Concordia University Wisconsin where the right field fence is 319 feet in his honor. In 2014, Yount was honored with the \\"Lombardi Award of Excellence\\" from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor Lombardi's legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the spirit of the acclaimed football coach. On October 20, 2018, Yount threw out the first pitch before Game 7 of the National League Championship Series between the Dodgers and Brewers. The Dodgers won 5-1, subsequently winning the series.

She lived from 550 BC to 475 BC and was a sister-wife of the Persian king of kings Cambyses II and wife of Darius I.  Name  The name \\"Atossa\\" (or \\"Atusa\\") means \\"skilled or learned\\". It can also mean \\"well trickling\\" or \\"well granting\\". Atossa is the Greek () transliteration of the Old Persian name UtauŒ∏a. Her name in Avestan is HutaosƒÅ.  Life  Atossa was born in . She was eldest daughter of Cyrus the Great; her mother may have been Cassandane. Atossa married her brother Cambyses II, probably after death of her father. When Darius I defeated the followers of a man claiming to be Bardiya (Smerdis), the younger brother of Cambyses II in 522 BC, he married Atossa. Atossa played an important role in the Achaemenid royal family, as she bore Darius the Great the next Achaemenid king, Xerxes I. Atossa had a \\"great authority\\" in the Achaemenid royal house and her marriage with Darius I is likely due to her power, influence and the fact that she was a direct descendant of Cyrus. Herodotus records in The Histories that Atossa was troubled by a bleeding lump in her breast. A Greek slave, Democedes, excised the tumor. This is the first recorded case of mastitis, sometimes interpreted as a sign of an inflammatory breast cancer. Xerxes I was the eldest son of Atossa and Darius. Atossa lived to see Xerxes invade Greece. Being a direct descendant of Cyrus the Great, Atossa had a great authority within Achamenian imperial house and court. Atossa's special position enabled Xerxes, who was not the eldest son of Darius, to succeed his father. Literary references Darius appears to Atossa in a scene from The Persians. Aeschylus included her as a central character in his tragedy The Persians. Atossa is also one of the major characters in the Gore Vidal novel Creation. Atossa is also included in Herodotus' The Histories and is shown to be a strong woman with a lot of influence. He even goes as far as to suggest that her wanting a Greek maiden was a reason for why Darius the Great decided to begin his campaign to Greece. In his history of cancer, The Emperor of All Maladies, Siddhartha Mukherjee imagines Atossa traveling through time, encountering different diagnoses and treatments for her breast cancer. Atossa becomes emblematic of cancer sufferers through history.  Legacy  Minor planet 810 Atossa discovered by Max Wolf, is named in her honor. The poet Matthew Arnold named his Persian cat ‚ÄòAtossa‚Äô. She is celebrated in his poem of 1882 called ‚ÄòPoor Matthias‚Äô, about the death of a pet canary.

He was the founder and owner of the defunct TV and media company CanWest Global Communications Corp and father to its former CEO and President Leonard Asper, former director and corporate secretary Gail Asper, as well as former Executive Vice President David Asper. He was also the leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party from 1970 to 1975 and is credited with the idea and vision to establish the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.  Life and career  Israel Asper was born to a Jewish family in Minnedosa, Manitoba, the son of musicians Leon Asper and Cecilia Swet, who had emigrated from Ukraine. Asper attended the University of Manitoba. In 1957 he received his law degree from the University of Manitoba, and was called to the bar shortly thereafter. He founded the firm of Asper, Freedman & Co. in 1959, and was also a partner and co-founder of the firm Buchwald, Asper, Henteleff (now Pitblado LLP) along with Harold Buchwald and Yude Henteleff. In 1970 he wrote The Benson Iceberg: A critical analysis of the White Paper on Tax Reform in Canada. He married Ruth Miriam \\"Babs\\" Asper on May 27, 1956 Toronto Star: \\"Winnipeg matriarch ‚ÄòBabs‚Äô Asper dies at 78\\" By John Goddard July 31, 2011 at Shaarey Zedek Synagogue (Winnipeg). Also in 1970, Asper was elected leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party (defeating university professor John Nesbitt). Asper represented a right-libertarian strain within the party. In the Manitoba election of 1973, he promoted a laissez-faire economy, and advocated the elimination of the welfare state. He also advocated the public financing of election campaigns, to ensure that politics would not be dominated entirely by monied interests. His Liberals won only five seats, and Asper was elected in Wolseley by only four votes. He resigned as party leader and MLA in 1975, though he continued to support the Manitoba Liberal Party in later years. His media empire started with the Winnipeg television station CKND-TV in 1975. CanWest grew to encompass the Global Television Network, the daily newspaper National Post and over 60 other Canadian newspapers. Asper was noted for his fierce loyalty to Manitoba, refusing enticements to move east to Toronto. The faculty of management at the University of Manitoba renamed itself the Asper School of Business in 2000. He was also a noted philanthropist, making major donations to the arts and education; in 2001 he donated $5 million CAD to the St. Boniface Hospital & Research Foundation in Winnipeg. Asper became an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1995. Also in 1995, he was inducted into the Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame. He was a prominent member of Canada's Jewish community, and a vocal supporter for Israel. Asper was also a close friend of many of Canada's prominent political and business elite, including Jean Chr√©tien and Paul Martin. Controversially, Asper's newspaper chain fired journalist Russell Mills when he wrote an article which was critical of Jean Chretien and demanded he resign. Asper died in St. Boniface Hospital at the age of 71 after suffering a heart attack. He was buried in the Shaarey Zedek Cemetery in Winnipeg in the presence of 1,500 mourners, including Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien and leading politicians.

He dropped out of high school, yet he transformed himself into one of American television's most prominent journalists. Jennings started his career early, hosting a Canadian radio show at age 9. He began his professional career with CJOH-TV in Ottawa during its early years, anchoring the local newscasts and hosting the teen dance show Saturday Date on Saturdays. In 1965, ABC News tapped him to anchor its flagship evening news program. Critics and others in the television news business attacked his inexperience, making his job difficult. He became a foreign correspondent in 1968, reporting from the Middle East. Jennings returned as one of World News Tonight three anchormen in 1978, and he was promoted to sole anchorman in 1983. He was also known for his marathon coverage of breaking news stories, staying on the air for 15 hours or more to anchor the live broadcast of events such as the Gulf War in 1991, the millennium celebrations in 1999-2000, and the September 11 attacks in 2001. In addition to anchoring, he was the host of many ABC News special reports and moderated several American presidential debates. He was always fascinated with the United States and became an American citizen in 2003. Jennings was one of the \\"Big Three\\" news anchormen, along with Tom Brokaw of NBC and Dan Rather of CBS, who dominated American evening network news from the early 1980s until his death in 2005, which closely followed the retirements of Brokaw in 2004 and Rather in 2005. Life and career =Early life= Jennings was born on July 29, 1938, in Toronto, Ontario; he and his younger sister Sarah were the only two children of Elizabeth (n√©e Osborne) and Charles Jennings, a prominent radio broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Peter Jennings started his broadcasting career at the age of nine, hosting Peter's People, a half-hour, Saturday morning, CBC Radio show for kids. His father was on a business trip to the Middle East when the show debuted; upon returning, Charles Jennings, who harbored a deep dislike of nepotism, was outraged to learn that the network had put his son on the air. When Jennings was 11 he began attending Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, where he excelled in sports. After the CBC moved his father to its Ottawa headquarters in the early 1950s, Jennings transferred to Lisgar Collegiate Institute. He struggled academically, and Jennings later surmised that it was out of \\"pure boredom\\" that he failed 10th grade and dropped out. \\"I loved girls,\\" he said. \\"I loved comic books. And for reasons I don't understand, I was pretty lazy.\\" Jennings then briefly attended Carleton University, where he says he \\"lasted about 10 minutes\\" before dropping out.Dare, Patrick (June 14, 1997). \\"Impatient broadcaster savours Carleton honour\\". The Ottawa Citizen through LexisNexis Academic, p. C3. Retrieved on January 3, 2007. He also attended the University of Ottawa. Although Jennings dreamed of following in his father's footsteps in broadcasting, his first job was as a bank teller for the Royal Bank of Canada. He had hoped that the company would assign him to its Havana branch; instead, it located him to the small town of Prescott, Ontario, before transferring him to its nearby Brockville branch. During this time, he explored acting by appearing in several amateur musical productions with the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society, including Damn Yankees and South Pacific. \\"Where are they now? \\". Orpheus Musical Theatre Society. Retrieved on November 27, 2006. It was in Brockville that the 21-year-old Jennings started his rise in broadcasting. In 1959, CFJR, a local radio station, hired him as a member of its news department; many of his stories were picked up by the CBC. By 1961, Jennings had joined the staff of CJOH-TV, then a new television station in Ottawa. When the station launched in March 1961, Jennings was initially an interviewer and co-producer for Vue, a late-night news program. His producers saw a youthful attractiveness in him that resembled that of Dick Clark, and Jennings soon found himself hosting Club Thirteen, a dance show similar to American Bandstand.Ward, Bruce (August 9, 2005). \\"Canadian's wit, insight and authority made him Americans' 'centre of gravity'\\".

The next year, CTV, Canada's first private TV network and a fledgling competitor of his father's network, hired the 24-year-old Jennings as co-anchor of its late- night national newscast. While reporting for CTV, he was the first Canadian journalist to arrive in Dallas after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, CTV sent Jennings to cover the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. There, he ran into Elmer Lower, then president of ABC News, who offered him a job as a correspondent for the American network, an opportunity Jennings initially rejected. \\"The job was pretty intimidating for a guy like me in a tiny city in Canada,\\" Jennings later recalled. \\"I thought, What if I screw up? What if I fail?\\" Three months later though, he changed his mind and moved to the United States. =United States' youngest anchor= 1968 press photo Jennings started reporting for ABC at its New York news bureau. At the time, ABC lagged behind the more established news divisions of NBC and CBS, and the network was trying to attract younger viewers. On February 1, 1965, ABC plucked the fresh-faced Canadian from the field and placed him at the anchor desk of Peter Jennings With the News, then a 15-minute nightly newscast. He replaced Ron Cochran, a fellow Canadian. At 26, Jennings was, and remains, the youngest-ever U.S. network news anchor. \\"ABC was in bad shape at the time,\\" Jennings said. \\"They were willing to try anything, and, to demonstrate the point, they tried me.\\"Peter Jennings: A Reporter's Life, p. 19. An inexperienced Jennings had a hard time keeping up with his rivals at the other networks, and he ‚Äì and the upstart ABC News ‚Äì could not compete with the venerable newscasts of Walter Cronkite at CBS and Chet Huntley and David Brinkley at NBC. Some in the American audience disliked Jennings's Canadian accent. He pronounced lieutenant as \\"leftenant\\", mangled the pronunciation of \\"Appomattox\\", and misidentified the \\"Marines' Hymn\\" as \\"Anchors Aweigh\\" at Lyndon Johnson's presidential inauguration; his lack of in-depth knowledge of American affairs and culture led critics to deride Jennings as a \\"glamorcaster\\". \\"It was a little ridiculous when you think about it,\\" he later reflected. \\"A 26-year-old trying to compete with Cronkite, Huntley and Brinkley. I was simply unqualified.\\" After three rocky years at the anchor desk, Jennings quit to become a foreign correspondent. =Foreign correspondent= Jennings was determined to build his journalism credentials abroad. In 1968, he established ABC's Middle East bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world.\\"Peter Jennings\\". ABC News. Retrieved on November 30, 2006. The next year, he demonstrated his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with Palestine: New State of Mind, a well-received half-hour documentary for ABC's Now news program. As ABC's Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with the intricacies of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, including the rise of the Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut.Fenyvesi, Charles (December 30, 1991 / January 6, 1992). \\"Washington whispers\\".

In 1972, Jennings covered his first major breaking news story, the Munich Olympics massacre of Israeli athletes by Black September. His live reporting, which drew on the expertise he had acquired in the Middle East, provided context for Americans who were unfamiliar with the Palestinian group. By hiding with his camera crew close to the athletic compound where the Israeli athletes were being held hostage, Jennings was able to provide ABC with clear video of the masked hostage-takers. He would later be criticized for insisting on using the terms \\"guerillas\\" and \\"commandos\\" instead of \\"terrorists\\" to describe the members of Black September. After events in Munich, Jennings continued to report on Middle East issues. In 1973, he covered the Yom Kippur War, and the following year, he served as chief correspondent and co-producer of Sadat: Action Biography, a profile of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat that would win him his first of two George Foster Peabody Awards. The documentary established Jennings as Sadat's favorite correspondent. Waite, Clayland. Jennings, Peter . The Museum of Broadcast Communications. Retrieved on December 1, 2006.

Meanwhile, ABC News and its newly installed president, Roone Arledge, were preparing an overhaul of its nightly news program, which was then known as ABC Evening News and whose ratings had languished in third place behind CBS and NBC since its inception. In the late 1970s, a disastrous pairing of Harry Reasoner and Barbara Walters at the anchor desk left the network searching for new ideas. Arledge decided to implement a three-anchor format for the program. On July 10, 1978, World News Tonight debuted with Frank Reynolds in Washington, Max Robinson in Chicago, and Jennings in London.Waters, Harry F. with Betsy Carter (August 20, 1979). \\"ABC News Marches On\\".

Jennings's official title was \\"Foreign Desk Anchor,\\" although he continued to serve as the network's chief foreign correspondent. By the summer of 1979, the innovative broadcast, which featured some of the same glitzy presentation as Arledge's previous television coup, Wide World of Sports, had climbed in the ratings. The newscast had gained 1.9 million households from its debut, and was now in a dead heat with NBC's evening newscast. Jennings also found renewed success in his personal life. In 1979, he married for the third time to fellow ABC correspondent Kati Marton. That same year, he became a father when Marton gave birth to their daughter, Elizabeth. In 1982, Jennings' and Marton's second child, Christopher, was born. As part of ABC's triumvirate, Jennings continued to cover major international news, especially Middle East issues. His nightly appearance at an anchor desk in London gave the impression that ABC News was more dedicated to foreign news than the other networks.Schwartz, Tony (December 12, 1981). \\"Arledge Fights, Yet Revels in, his Outsider Status\\" (fee required).

His insistence on covering the major international stories himself irked some of his fellow ABC foreign correspondents, who came to resent being scooped by what they deemed as \\"Jennings' Flying Circus.\\" Jennings, too, was not completely satisfied with his job in London. When his contract expired with ABC in the early 1980s, Jennings flirted with the possibility of moving back to Canada and working with the CBC on its new nightly newscast, The Journal. The CBC could not meet Jennings' renegotiation deadlines, though, and the deal fell through.Riches, Hester (June 17, 1981). \\"CBC blew its chance to net Peter Jennings\\".

His absence caused a dip in the ratings for ABC's nightly newscast. ABC originally expected a full recovery, and relocated Jennings to its Washington bureau to fill in for Reynolds while he was sick; the move helped buoy the newscast's ratings, though it remained in third place. On July 20, 1983, Reynolds died unexpectedly after developing acute hepatitis. On August 9, 1983, ABC announced that Jennings had signed a four-year contract with the network and would become the sole anchor and senior editor for World News Tonight on September 5. Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, and the beginning of what the media would deem the \\"Big Three\\" era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. \\"With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces,\\" he said. \\"That's an inevitable byproduct of television. But if that is what it comes down to in terms of the approach we take, if our approach is that singular, then we will all have made a mistake.\\"Smith, Sally Bedell (August 10, 1983). \\"Peter Jennings Named Sole ABC Anchor\\".

In June 1984, Jennings, who later admitted that his political knowledge was limited at the time, co-anchored ABC's coverage of the Democratic National Convention with David Brinkley. \\"I had not covered an election campaign in 16 years,\\" Jennings said, \\"so here was I going to co-anchor with David Brinkley in 1984, and he wasn't even sure I knew who the faces belonged to, and he was right.\\"Kenney, Charles (November 6, 1988). \\"Why Peter Jennings is So Good\\".

Out of that concern, Jennings hosted a 90-minute special, War in the Gulf: Answering Children's Questions the next Saturday morning; the program featured Jennings, ABC correspondents, and American military personnel answering phoned-in questions and explaining the war to young viewers.Carter, Bill (January 25, 1991). \\"Jennings Turns to Children's Worries\\".

Jennings was once again mindful of his audience, prefacing the coverage of the Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas with remarks for children. \\"You may hear some not very nice language,\\" said Jennings.

On September 9, 1992, ABC announced that it would be switching the format of its political coverage to give less recognition to staged sound bites. \\"We're aware that a lot of you are turned off by the political process and that many of you put at least some of the blame on us,\\" Jennings told viewers on World News Tonight. \\"We'll only devote time to a candidate's daily routine if it is more than routine. There will be less attention to staged appearances and sound bites designed exclusively for television.\\" After Bill Clinton was elected as president in November 1992, Jennings featured the new administration in two of his specials for children; he anchored President Clinton: Answering Children's Questions in February 1993; and Kids in the Crossfire: Violence in America in November 1993, a live special from a Washington, DC, junior high school which featured Attorney General Janet Reno and rapper MC Lyte. The early 1990s also served up a series of difficult experiences and public embarrassment for Jennings. On August 13, 1993, Jennings and Kati Marton publicly announced their separation in Newsday. The couple had previously split in 1987 for four months after Jennings found out that Marton was having an affair with Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen.Knight-Ridder/New York Daily News (August 15, 1993). \\"Heart-breaker Jennings leaves his third wife\\" (fee required).

Reviewing the show for The Washington Post, Ken Ringle called it \\"an ingenue's stroll down the narrow tunnels of academic revisionism\\" that \\"purports to discover a post-World War II coverup -- a smoke screen designed to refute any suggestion that the Hiroshima bombing was anything but a military necessity.\\" The conservative Media Research Center called the show \\"a one-sided version of revisionist history\\" for suggesting \\"the U.S. dropped the bomb not to save lives, but to play a cynical Cold War game of intimidating the Soviets.\\" Some viewers of the documentary mailed bus fares to Jennings, telling him to return to Canada. Jennings pleased some conservatives though, after his three-year lobbying effort to create a full-time religion correspondent at ABC News succeeded in the hiring of Peggy Wehmeyer in January 1994, making her the first such network reporter. ABC increased its coverage of religious topics, and in March 1995, Jennings anchored Peter Jennings Reporting: In the Name of God, a well- received documentary on the changing nature of American churches. At a taping of a \\"town meeting\\" segment for KOMO-TV of Seattle in February 1995, Jennings expressed regret for his ABC radio remarks on the 1994 midterm elections. \\"People thought I had insulted their sacred mandate and some thought I should go back to Canada,\\" he said. \\"I hope I don't make that mistake again.\\"Taylor, Chuck (February 3, 1995).

F-15E Strike Eagle in February 1994 During the mid-1990s, television critics praised Jennings for his insistence on not letting the O. J. Simpson murder case swamp the newscast. Instead, Jennings devoted his energies to covering the Bosnian War, anchoring three hour-long prime time specials on the subject and one Saturday-morning special aimed at children. ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996.

Bolstered by strong viewership of its coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games and heavy coverage of O.J. Simpson's trial, NBC's Nightly News overtook the ABC newscast for two weeks in late July and early September. This short bump provided momentum for NBC, which started making steady gains in the ratings. Worried, Jennings and ABC decided to cut back on international reporting and give more air time to \\"soft stories\\", in an effort to emulate the success of Nightly News. The changes provoked a backlash from regular viewers, and ratings plummeted. \\"We did very badly with it,\\" Jennings said. \\"The audience kicked us in the teeth.\\" Although changes were made to World News Tonight to restore its commitment to major issues and stop the hemorrhaging, Nightly News ended 1997 as the number-one evening newscast. The slide in the ratings coincided with some rockiness at ABC News. The company scrapped plans to develop a cable news channel. On May 29, 1998, David Westin succeeded Roone Arledge as president of ABC News. Both denied that the disappointing ratings performance of World News Tonight contributed to the decision. A 24-hour strike by the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians disrupted ABC's coverage of 1998's November elections after talks between the union and ABC broke down. Several Democratic candidates denied interviews to support the union. None of the shake-ups helped Jennings retake the nightly ratings crown, but World News Tonight still offered stiff competition at second place. As the millennium approached, Jennings and the network started preparing for extensive retrospectives of the 20th century. The anchor teamed with former Life magazine journalist Todd Brewster to pen The Century, a 606-page book on 20th-century America. Designed as a companion book for ABC's upcoming documentary series of the same name, the book topped The New York Times Best Seller list in December 1998, a month after it debuted.The New York Times (December 20, 1998). \\"BEST SELLERS: December 20, 1998\\".

Jennings also anchored a longer, 15-hour version, The Century: America's Time, on the History Channel in April 1999. On December 31, 1999, Jennings was on the air for 23 straight hours to anchor ABC 2000 Today, ABC's massive millennium eve special. An estimated 175 million people tuned into at least a portion of the program.

September 11 Jennings anchored ABC's coverage of the September 11 attacks for 17 straight hours, an effort described as \\"Herculean\\" by television critics. Like other network news anchors, he was widely praised for guiding Americans through the disaster. At one point, Jennings broke his composure after receiving phone calls from his children. \\"We do not very often make recommendations for people's behavior from this chair,\\" he said, \\"but...if you're a parent, you've got a kid in some other part of the country, call them up. Exchange observations.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZdL_XNBcyo His coverage was not without controversy. Jennings was criticized by Rush Limbaugh among others for commenting about President George W. Bush on-air: \\"Where is the president of the United States? ... I know we don't know where he is, but pretty soon the country needs to know where he is.\\" ABC was flooded with more than 10,000 angry phone calls and e-mails. On September 13, Jennings received more criticism ‚Äî this time for hosting a forum for Middle East experts that included Palestinian Authority negotiator Hanan Ashrawi. In the summer of 2002, Jennings and ABC refused to allow Toby Keith to open their coverage of July 4 celebrations with \\"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)\\", prompting criticism from Keith and country music fans, who highlighted the anchor's Canadian citizenship. The events of September 11 added new meaning to In Search of America, the project Jennings and Brewster started after the success of their previous collaboration. The two began writing the book in early 2001; after the terrorist attacks, they revisited many of the people they had interviewed to see how the events had affected them.Hogan, Ron (August 5, 2002). \\"PW Talks with Peter Jennings and Todd Brewster\\".

Jennings also anchored a six- part television series in September 2002, which featured the same name as the book. Despite the success of the TV series and heavy promotion by the book's publisher, In Search of America failed to generate much interest or sales. Jennings's work on In Search of America and the September 11 attacks contributed to his decision in 2003 to become a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. \\"I think that 9/11 and the subsequent travel I did in the country afterwards made me feel connected in new ways,\\" he said. \\"And when we were working on the America project I spent a lot of time on the road, which meant away from my editor's desk, and I just got much more connected to the Founding Fathers' dreams and ideas for the future.\\"Boswell, Randy (July 8, 2003). \\"Why Peter Jennings chose to become an American\\".

However, despite having almost always reported from the scene of any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an upper respiratory infection in late December 2004; he was forced to anchor from New York during the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, while his competitors traveled to the region.

On April 29, 2005, Jennings posted a letter on ABCNews.com with an update of his status and expressing thanks to those who had offered him their good wishes and prayers. In June, Jennings visited the ABC News headquarters, and addressed staff members in an emotional scene in the World News Tonight newsroom; he thanked Gibson for closing each broadcast with the phrase, \\"for Peter Jennings and all of us at ABC News.\\" During his visit, however, his colleagues noticed he was ill to the point where he could barely speak.

Coptology is the science of Coptic studies, the study of Coptic language and literature.Alahram weekly Origin The European interest in Coptology may have started as early as the 15th century AD. The term was used in 1976 when the First International Congress of Coptology was held in Cairo under the title \\"Colloquium on the Future of Coptic Studies\\" (11-17 December). This was followed by the establishment of the \\"International Association for Coptic Studies\\". International Association for Coptic Studies One of the founders of the Colloquium and the Association was Pahor Labib, director of the Coptic Museum in Cairo during 1951-65. The words 'Coptology' and 'Coptologist' were introduced into the English language by Aziz Suryal Atiya. Worldwide institutions There are now institutions that give more or less regular courses of Coptology in 47 countries around the world, including Australia, Great Britain, Canada, Germany, Israel, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. A rotating chair of Coptic studies was opened at the American University in Cairo in 2002.

This order includes whales, porpoises, and dolphins. Brain size Brain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. However, many other factors also affect intelligence, and recent discoveries concerning bird intelligence have called into question the influence of brain size. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that in general, mammalian brain size scales at approximately the or exponent of body mass. Comparison of actual brain size with the size expected from allometry provides an encephalization quotient (EQ) that can be used as a more accurate indicator of an animal's intelligence. * Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) have the largest known brain mass of any extant animal, averaging 7.8 kg in mature males. * Orcas (Orcinus orca ) have the second largest known brain mass of any extant animal. (5.4-6.8 kg) Brain size * Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have an absolute brain mass of 1,500‚Äì1,700 grams. This is slightly greater than that of humans (1,300‚Äì1,400 grams) and about four times that of chimpanzees (400 grams). * The brain to body mass ratio (not the encephalization quotient) in some members of the odontocete superfamily Delphinoidea (dolphins, porpoises, belugas, and narwhals) is greater than modern humans, and greater than all other mammals (there is debate whether that of the treeshrew might be second in place of humans).\\"Origin and evolution of large brains in toothed whales\\", Lori Marino1,Daniel W. McShea2, Mark D. Uhen, The Anatomoical Record, 20 OCT 2004 In some dolphins, it is less than half that of humans: 0.9% versus 2.1%. This comparison seems more favorable if one excludes the large amount of insulating blubber (15-20% of mass). * The encephalization quotient varies widely between species. The La Plata dolphin has an EQ of approximately 1.67; the Ganges river dolphin of 1.55; the orca of 2.57; the bottlenose dolphin of 4.14; and the tucuxi dolphin of 4.56; In comparison to other animals, elephants have an EQ ranging from 1.13 to 2.36; chimpanzees of approximately 2.49; dogs of 1.17; cats of 1.00; and mice of 0.50. * The majority of mammals are born with a brain close to 90% of the adult brain weight. Humans are born with 28% of the adult brain weight, chimpanzees with 54%, bottlenose dolphins with 42.5%, and elephants with 35%. Spindle cells (neurons without extensive branching) have been discovered in the brains of the humpback whale, fin whale, sperm whale, killer whale, bottlenose dolphins, Risso's dolphins, and beluga whales. Humans, great apes, and elephants, species all well known for their high intelligence, are the only others known to have spindle cells. Spindle neurons appear to play a central role in the development of intelligent behavior. Such a discovery may suggest a convergent evolution of these species. Brain structure Elephant brains also show a complexity similar to dolphin brains, and are also more convoluted than that of humans, and with a cortex thicker than that of cetaceans. It is generally agreed that the growth of the neocortex, both absolutely and relative to the rest of the brain, during human evolution, has been responsible for the evolution of human intelligence, however defined. While a complex neocortex usually indicates high intelligence, there are exceptions. For example, the echidna has a highly developed brain, yet is not widely considered very intelligent, though preliminary investigations into their intelligence suggest that echidnas are capable of more advanced cognitive tasks than were previously assumed. In 2014, it was shown for the first time that a species of dolphin, the long- finned pilot whale, has more neocortical neurons than any mammal studied to date including humans. Unlike terrestrial mammals, dolphin brains contain a paralimbic lobe, which may possibly be used for sensory processing. The dolphin is a voluntary breather, even during sleep, with the result that veterinary anaesthesia of dolphins would result in asphyxiation. All sleeping mammals, including dolphins, experience a stage known as REM sleep. Ridgway reports that EEGs show alternating hemispheric asymmetry in slow waves during sleep, with occasional sleep-like waves from both hemispheres. This result has been interpreted to mean that dolphins sleep only one hemisphere of their brain at a time, possibly to control their voluntary respiration system or to be vigilant for predators. This is also given as explanation for the large size of their brains. Dolphin brain stem transmission time is faster than that normally found in humans, and is approximately equivalent to the speed in rats. The dolphin's greater dependence on sound processing is evident in the structure of its brain: its neural area devoted to visual imaging is only about one-tenth that of the human brain, while the area devoted to acoustical imaging is about 10 times as large. Sensory experiments suggest a great degree of cross-modal integration in the processing of shapes between echolocative and visual areas of the brain. Unlike the case of the human brain, the cetacean optic chiasm is completely crossed, and there is behavioral evidence for hemispheric dominance for vision.  Brain evolution  The evolution of encephalization in cetaceans is similar to that in primates. Though the general trend in their evolutionary history increased brain mass, body mass, and encephalization quotient, a few lineages actually underwent decephalization, although the selective pressures that caused this are still under debate. Among cetaceans, Odontoceti tend to have higher encephalization quotients than Mysticeti, which is at least partially due to the fact that Mysticeti have much larger body masses without a compensating increase in brain mass. As far as which selective pressures drove the encephalization (or decephalization) of cetacean brains, current research espouses a few main theories. The most promising suggests that cetacean brain size and complexity increased to support complex social relations. It could also have been driven by changes in diet, the emergence of echolocation, or an increase in territorial range. Problem-solving ability Some research shows that dolphins, among other animals, understand concepts such as numerical continuity, though not necessarily counting. Dolphins may be able to discriminate between numbers. Several researchers observing animals' ability to learn set formation tend to rank dolphins at about the level of elephants in intelligence, and show that dolphins do not surpass other highly intelligent animals in problem solving. A 1982 survey of other studies showed that in the learning of \\"set formation\\", dolphins rank highly, but not as high as some other animals.Macphail, E. M. \\"Brain and Intelligence in Vertebrates\\". (Oxford science publications) Oxford University Press, 1982, 433 pp. Behavior =Pod characteristics= Dolphin group sizes vary quite dramatically. River dolphins usually congregate in fairly small groups from 6 to 12 in number or, in some species, singly or in pairs. The individuals in these small groups know and recognize one another. Other species such as the oceanic pantropical spotted dolphin, common dolphin and spinner dolphin travel in large groups of hundreds of individuals. It is unknown whether every member of the group is acquainted with every other. However, large packs can act as a single cohesive unitobservations show that if an unexpected disturbance, such as a shark approach, occurs from the flank or from beneath the group, the group moves in near-unison to avoid the threat. This means that the dolphins must be aware not only of their near neighbors but also of other individuals nearby in a similar manner to which humans perform \\"Audience waves\\". This is achieved by sight, and possibly also echolocation. One hypothesis proposed by Jerison (1986) is that members of a pod of dolphins are able to share echolocation results with each other to create a better understanding of their surroundings. Resident orcas living in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington, United States live in extremely stable family groups. The basis of this social structure is the matriline, consisting of a mother and her offspring, who travel with her for life. Male orcas never leave their mothers' pods, while female offspring may branch off to form their own matriline if they have many offspring of their own. Males have a particularly strong bond with their mother, and travel with them their entire lives, which can exceed 50 years. Relationships in the orca population can be discovered through their vocalizations. Matrilines who share a common ancestor from only a few generations back share mostly the same dialect, comprising a pod. Pods who share some calls indicate a common ancestor from many generations back, and make up a clan. The orcas use these dialects to avoid inbreeding. They mate outside the clan, which is determined by the different vocalizations. There is evidence that other species of dolphins may also have dialects. In bottlenose dolphin studies by Wells in Sarasota, Florida, and Smolker in Shark Bay, Australia, females of a community are all linked either directly or through a mutual association in an overall social structure known as fission-fusion. Groups of the strongest association are known as \\"bands\\", and their composition can remain stable over years. There is some genetic evidence that band members may be related, but these bands are not necessarily limited to a single matrilineal line. There is no evidence that bands compete with each other. In the same research areas, as well as in Moray Firth, Scotland, males form strong associations of two to three individuals, with a coefficient of association between 70 and 100. These groups of males are known as \\"alliances\\", and members often display synchronous behaviors such as respiration, jumping, and breaching. Alliance composition is stable on the order of tens of years, and may provide a benefit for the acquisition of females for mating. The complex social strategies of marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins, \\"provide interesting parallels\\" with the social strategies of elephants and chimpanzees. =Complex play= Dolphins are known to engage in complex play behavior, which includes such things as producing stable underwater toroidal air-core vortex rings or \\"bubble rings\\". There are two main methods of bubble ring production: rapid puffing of a burst of air into the water and allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring; or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into the helical vortex currents thus formed. The dolphin will often then examine its creation visually and with sonar. They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex- rings they have created, so that they burst into many separate normal bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface. Certain whales are also known to produce bubble rings or bubble nets for the purpose of foraging. Many dolphin species also play by riding in waves, whether natural waves near the shoreline in a method akin to human \\"body-surfing\\", or within the waves induced by the bow of a moving boat in a behavior known as bow riding. =Cross-species cooperation= There have been instances in captivity of various species of dolphin and porpoise helping and interacting across species, including helping beached whales. Also they have been known to live alongside resident (fish eating) orca whales for limited amounts of time. Dolphins have also been known to aid human swimmers in need, and in at least one instance a distressed dolphin approached human divers seeking assistance. =Creative behavior= Aside from having exhibited the ability to learn complex tricks, dolphins have also demonstrated the ability to produce creative responses. This was studied by Karen Pryor during the mid-1960s at Sea Life Park in Hawaii, and was published as The Creative Porpoise: Training for Novel Behavior in 1969. The two test subjects were two rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis), named Malia (a regular show performer at Sea Life Park) and Hou (a research subject at adjacent Oceanic Institute). The experiment tested when and whether the dolphins would identify that they were being rewarded (with fish) for originality in behavior and was very successful. However, since only two dolphins were involved in the experiment, the study is difficult to generalize. Starting with the dolphin named Malia, the method of the experiment was to choose a particular behavior exhibited by her each day and reward each display of that behavior throughout the day's session. At the start of each new day Malia would present the prior day's behavior, but only when a new behavior was exhibited was a reward given. All behaviors exhibited were, at least for a time, known behaviors of dolphins. After approximately two weeks Malia apparently exhausted \\"normal\\" behaviors and began to repeat performances. This was not rewarded. According to Pryor, the dolphin became almost despondent. However, at the sixteenth session without novel behavior, the researchers were presented with a flip they had never seen before. This was reinforced. As related by Pryor, after the new display: \\"instead of offering that again she offered a tail swipe we'd never seen; we reinforced that. She began offering us all kinds of behavior that we hadn't seen in such a mad flurry that finally we could hardly choose what to throw fish at\\". The second test subject, Hou, took thirty-three sessions to reach the same stage. On each occasion the experiment was stopped when the variability of dolphin behavior became too complex to make further positive reinforcement meaningful. The same experiment was repeated with humans, and it took the volunteers about the same length of time to figure out what was being asked of them. After an initial period of frustration or anger, the humans realised they were being rewarded for novel behavior. In dolphins this realisation produced excitement and more and more novel behaviorsin humans it mostly just produced relief. Captive orcas have displayed responses indicating they get bored with activities. For instance, when Paul Spong worked with the orca Skana, he researched her visual skills. However, after performing favorably in the 72 trials per day, Skana suddenly began consistently getting every answer wrong. Spong concluded that a few fish were not enough motivation. He began playing music, which seemed to provide Skana with much more motivation. At the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Mississippi, it has also been observed that the resident dolphins seem to show an awareness of the future. The dolphins are trained to keep their own tank clean by retrieving rubbish and bringing it to a keeper, to be rewarded with a fish. However, one dolphin, named Kelly, has apparently learned a way to get more fish, by hoarding the rubbish under a rock at the bottom of the pool and bringing it up one small piece at a time. =Use of tools= , scientists have observed wild bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia using a basic tool. When searching for food on the sea floor, many of these dolphins were seen tearing off pieces of sponge and wrapping them around their rostra, presumably to prevent abrasions and facilitate digging. Communication Whale song is the sounds made by whales and which is used for different kinds of communication. Dolphins emit two distinct kinds of acoustic signals, which are called whistles and clicks: * Clicksquick broadband burst pulsesare used for echolocation, although some lower-frequency broadband vocalizations may serve a non-echolocative purpose such as communication; for example, the pulsed calls of orcas. Pulses in a click train are emitted at intervals of ‚âà35‚Äì50 milliseconds, and in general these inter-click intervals are slightly greater than the round-trip time of sound to the target. * Whistlesnarrow-band frequency modulated (FM) signalsare used for communicative purposes, such as contact calls, the pod-specific dialects of resident orcas, or the signature whistle of bottlenose dolphins. There is strong evidence that some specific whistles, called signature whistles, are used by dolphins to identify and/or call each other; dolphins have been observed emitting both other specimens' signature whistles, and their own. A unique signature whistle develops quite early in a dolphin's life, and it appears to be created in imitation of the signature whistle of the dolphin's mother. Imitation of the signature whistle seems to occur only among the mother and its young, and among befriended adult males. Xitco reported the ability of dolphins to eavesdrop passively on the active echolocative inspection of an object by another dolphin. Herman calls this effect the \\"acoustic flashlight\\" hypothesis, and may be related to findings by both Herman and Xitco on the comprehension of variations on the pointing gesture, including human pointing, dolphin postural pointing, and human gaze, in the sense of a redirection of another individual's attention, an ability which may require theory of mind. The environment where dolphins live makes experiments much more expensive and complicated than for many other species; additionally, the fact that cetaceans can emit and hear sounds (which are believed to be their main means of communication) in a range of frequencies much wider than humans can means that sophisticated equipment, which was scarcely available in the past, is needed to record and analyse them. For example, clicks can contain significant energy in frequencies greater than 110 kHz (for comparison, it is unusual for a human to be able to hear sounds above 20 kHz), requiring that equipment have a sampling rates of at least 220 kHz; MHz-capable hardware is often used. In addition to the acoustic communication channel, the visual modality is also significant. The contrasting pigmentation of the body may be used, for example with \\"flashes\\" of the hypopigmented ventral area of some species, as can the production of bubble streams during signature whistling. Also, much of the synchronous and cooperative behaviors, as described in the Behavior section of this entry, as well as cooperative foraging methods, likely are managed at least partly by visual means. Experiments have shown that they can learn human sign language and can use whistles for 2-way human‚Äìanimal communication. Phoenix and Akeakamai, bottlenose dolphins, understood individual words and basic sentences like \\"touch the frisbee with your tail and then jump over it\\" (Herman, Richards, & Wolz 1984). Phoenix learned whistles, and Akeakamai learned sign language. Both dolphins understood the significance of the ordering of tasks in a sentence. A study conducted by Jason Bruck of the University of Chicago showed that bottlenose dolphins can remember whistles of other dolphins they had lived with after 20 years of separation. Each dolphin has a unique whistle that functions like a name, allowing the marine mammals to keep close social bonds. The new research shows that dolphins have the longest memory yet known in any species other than humans.Bruck, Jason N. (2013), \\"Decades-long social memory in bottlenose dolphins\\", Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. Vol. 280, article 20131726. Self- awareness Self-awareness, though not well defined scientifically, is believed to be the precursor to more advanced processes like meta-cognitive reasoning (thinking about thinking) that are typical of humans. Scientific research in this field has suggested that bottlenose dolphins, alongside elephants and great apes, possess self-awareness. The most widely used test for self-awareness in animals is the mirror test, developed by Gordon Gallup in the 1970s, in which a temporary dye is placed on an animal's body, and the animal is then presented with a mirror. In 1995, Marten and Psarakos used television to test dolphin self-awareness.Marten, Ken and Psarakos, Suchi \\"Using Self-View Television to Distinguish between Self-Examination and Social Behavior in the Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)\\" (Consciousness and Cognition, Volume 4, Number 2, June 1995) They showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage, and another dolphin. They concluded that their evidence suggested self-awareness rather than social behavior. While this particular study has not been repeated since then, dolphins have since passed the mirror test. However, some researchers have argued that evidence for self-awareness has not been convincingly demonstrated.Gallup Jr, Gordon G., and James R. Anderson. \\"Self-recognition in animals: Where do we stand 50 years later? Lessons from cleaner wrasse and other species.\\" Psychology of Consciousness: Theory, Research, and Practice (2019).

Chartered as a private company in 1912 as the Pacific Great Eastern Railway (PGE), it was acquired by the provincial government in 1918. In 1972 it was renamed to the British Columbia Railway, and in 1984 it took on its present name of BC Rail. Until 2004 it operated as the third largest railway in Canada, providing freight, passenger, and excursion rail services throughout BC on 2,320 km(1,440 mi) of mainline track. It was designated a Class II Railway until 2004, and remains a crown corporation today. It also ran the Royal Hudson services, as well as the Premier's private train. In 2004, the operations (including a vast amount of land, buildings, and all rolling stock) were leased to Canadian National Railway (CN) for an initial period of 60 Years for the price of $550 Million. CN holds the sole right to renew the lease for up to 999 years through a series of options. The Lease also allows for BC Rail to give CN title to any and all of the railway for the nominal price of $1. The lease was made despite the promise of Premier Gordon Campbell to not sell the railway in the preceding election, and was the subject of the biggest political scandal in BC History resulting in the British Columbia Legislature Raids. The BC Liberal Government had been accused of fabricated falsehoods about the state of its debts and viability in order to justify the deal with CN, claiming the railway was in disarray.Liberals, Stop Lying about BC Rail, Will McMartin, The Tyee, March 29, 2010 Canadian Pacific, a rival bidder, privately stated in since-released communications that the bid was \\"rigged\\". CN has been one of the BC Liberal Party's biggest donors ever since, contributing over $320,000 to the party as of 2019. In 2010, two BC Liberal Party ministerial aides pleaded guilty to charges of breach of trust and receiving a benefit for leaking information about the BC Rail leasing process, with both being sentenced to two-years less-a-day house arrest and 150 hours of community service. David Basi, one of the aides, was fined an additional $75,600 - the amount he accepted as a bribe - and was also later found to have violated the terms of his house arrest, resulting in an electronic ankle tag being mandated for the remainder of his sentence. BC Rail remains an operating, publicly owned crown corporation today. It retains ownership of the entire rail bed stretching from Prince George to Squamish, as well as ownership of other assets leased to CN. Additionally, BC Rail retains significant real estate investments throughout BC, as well as a 40 km stretch of track from Roberts Bank Superport in Delta to Langley. The planned sale of this 40 km stretch was cancelled after the initial BC Rail Scandal. From 1978 to 2000, BC Rail was highly profitable, posting profits in every single year throughout that period. History =1912‚Äì1948= The Pacific Great Eastern Railway (PGE) was incorporated on February 27, 1912, to build a line from Vancouver north to a connection with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP) at Prince George. Although independent from the GTP, the PGE had agreed that the GTP, whose western terminus was at the remote northern port of Prince Rupert, could use their line to gain access to Vancouver. The railway was given its name due to a loose association with England's Great Eastern Railway. Its financial backers were Timothy Foley, Patrick Welch, and John Stewart, whose construction firm of Foley, Welch and Stewart was among the leading railway contractors in North America. Upon incorporation, the PGE took over the Howe Sound and Northern Railway, which at that point had built nine miles (15 km) of track north of Squamish.Andreae The British Columbia government gave the railway a guarantee of principal and 4% interest (later increased to 4.5% to make the bonds saleable) on the construction bonds of the railway.Sanford, p.60, Andreae, p. 194. By 1915, the line was opened from Squamish north to Chasm. The railway was starting to run out of money, however. In 1915 it failed to make an interest payment on its bonds, obliging the provincial government to make good on its bond guarantee. In the 1916 provincial election campaign, the Liberal Party alleged that some of the money advanced to the railway for bond guarantee payments had instead gone into Conservative Party campaign funds. In the election, the Conservatives, who had won every seat in the legislature in 1912 election, lost to the Liberals. The Liberals then took Foley, Welch, and Stewart to court to recover $5 million of allegedly unaccounted funds. In early 1918, the railway's backers agreed to pay the government $1.1 million and turn the railway over to the government.Sanford p.72, Andreae, p. 195. When the government took over the railway, two separate sections of trackage had been completed: A small twenty mile section between North Vancouver and Horseshoe Bay, and one between Squamish and Clinton. By 1921, the provincial government had extended the railway to a point north of Quesnel, still 80 miles south of a connection to Prince George, but it was not extended further. The track north of Quesnel was later removed. Construction of the line between Horseshoe Bay and Squamish was given a low priority because there was already a barge in operation between Squamish and Vancouver, and the railway wanted to discontinue operations on the North Vancouver- Horseshoe Bay line. However, the railway had an agreement with the municipality of West Vancouver to provide passenger service that it was unable to get out of until 1928, when they paid the city $140,000 in support of its road-building programme. The last trains on the line ran on November 29, 1928, and the line fell into disuse, but was never formally abandoned.Sanford, p.72. For the next 20 years the railway would run from \\"nowhere to nowhere\\". It did not connect with any other railway, and there were no large urban centres on its route. It existed mainly to connect logging and mining operations in the British Columbia Interior with the coastal town of Squamish, where resources could then be transported by sea. The government still intended for the railway to reach Prince George, but the resources to do so were not available, especially during the Great Depression and World War II. The unfortunate state of the railway caused it to be given nicknames such as \\"Province's Great Expense,\\" \\"Prince George Eventually,\\" \\"Past God's Endurance,\\" \\"Please Go Easy,\\"and \\"Puff, Grunt and Expire.\\" =1949‚Äì1971= Pacific Great Eastern Railway logo Starting in 1949, the Pacific Great Eastern began to expand. Track was laid north of Quesnel to a junction with the Canadian National Railways at Prince George. That line opened on November 1, 1952. Between 1953 and 1956 the PGE constructed a line between Squamish and North Vancouver. The PGE used their former right-of-way between North Vancouver and Horseshoe Bay, to the dismay of some residents of West Vancouver who, mistakenly believing the line was abandoned, had encroached on it. The line opened on August 27, 1956. By 1958 the PGE had reached north from Prince George to Fort St. John and to Dawson Creek where it met the Northern Alberta Railways.Railway Magazine March 1958 pp. 166-169 David Sibley: The Pacific Great Eastern Railway A 1964 PGE passenger timetable cover; Peace River at Taylor. In 1958, British Columbia Premier W.A.C. Bennett boasted that he would extend the railway to the Yukon and Alaska, and further extension of the railway was undertaken in the 1960s. A spur was constructed to Mackenzie in 1966.Prince George Citizen, 29 Aug 1966 A third line was extended west from the mainline (somewhat north of Prince George) to Fort St. James. It was completed on August 1, 1968. The largest construction undertaken in the 1960s was to extend the mainline from Fort St. John north to Fort Nelson, less than away from the Yukon. The Fort Nelson Subdivision was opened by Premier Bennett on September 10, 1971. Unfortunately, the opening of the line was overshadowed by the inaugural train derailing south of Williams Lake, south of Prince George. =1972‚Äì1989= British Columbia Railway logo (1972‚Äì1984) The railway underwent two changes of name during this time period. In 1972, the railway's name was changed to the British Columbia Railway (BCR). In 1984, the BCR was restructured. Under the new organization, BC Rail Ltd. was formed, owned jointly by the British Columbia Railway Company (BCRC) and by a BCRC subsidiary, BCR Properties Ltd. The rail operations became known as BC Rail. In 1973, the British Columbia government acquired and restored an ex-Canadian Pacific Railway 4-6-4 steam locomotive of the type known as \\"Royal Hudsons\\", a name that King George VI permitted the class to be called after the Canadian Pacific Railway used one on the royal train in 1939. The locomotive that the government acquired, numbered 2860, was built in 1940 and was the first one built as a Royal Hudson. The government then leased it, along with ex-Canadian Pacific 2-8-0 #3716 to the British Columbia Railway, which started excursion service with the locomotive between North Vancouver and Squamish on June 20, 1974. The train ran between June and September on Wednesdays through Sundays from 1974-2001. During this time, the Royal Hudson Steam Train was the only regularly scheduled, mainline steam operation on a Class 1 railroad in North America. Map of the British Columbia Railway In the 1960s, a new line had been projected to run northwest from Fort St. James to Dease Lake, away. On October 15, 1973, the first of the extension to Lovell were opened. The cost of the line was significantly greater than what was estimated, however. Contractors working on the remainder of the line alleged that the railway had misled them regarding the amount of work required so that it could obtain low bids, and took the railway to court. The Dease Lake line was starting to appear increasingly uneconomical. There was a world decline in the demand for asbestos and copper, two main commodities that would be hauled over the line. As well, the Cassiar Highway that already served Dease Lake had recently been upgraded. Combined with the increasing construction costs, the Dease Lake line could no longer be justified. Construction stopped on April 5, 1977. Track had been laid to Jackson Creek, past Fort St. James, and clearing and grading were in progress on the rest of the extension. It had cost $168 million to that point, well over twice the initial estimate. The trackbed can be seen on Google Earth all the way to Dease Lake, via the small towns of Leo Creek and Takla Landing. The management and operation of the railway had been called into question, and on February 7, 1977, the provincial government appointed a Royal Commission, the McKenzie Royal Commission, to investigate the railway. Its recommendations were released on August 25, 1978.See Ruppenthal, Karl M. and Keast, Thomas, \\"The British Columbia Railway--A Railway Derailed,\\" 1979, Centre for Transportation Studies (). It recommended that construction not continue on the of roadbed between Dease Lake and the current end of track, and that trains be terminated at Driftwood, past Lovell. The rest of the track would be left in place but not used. In 1983, after logging operations ceased at Driftwood and traffic declined sharply, the Dease Lake line was closed. However, it was reopened in 1991 and, as of 2005, extends to a point called Minaret Creek, British Columbia, still over south of Dease Lake. Many of the Commission's other recommendations, including the abandonment of the Fort Nelson line, and discontinuation of uneconomic operations such as passenger services, were not followed.Horton, p.2. In the early 1980s the railway built a new line and acquired another. The Tumbler Ridge Subdivision, an electrified branch line, opened in 1983 to the Quintette and Bullmoose mines, two coal mines northeast of Prince George that produced coal for Japan. It has the lowest crossing of the Rocky Mountains by a railway, at 3,815 feet (1,163 m). There are two large tunnels under the mountains: The Table Tunnel, long, and the Wolverine Tunnel, long. Electrified owing to the long tunnels and close proximity to the W. A. C. Bennett Dam and transmission lines, it was one of the few electrified freight lines in North America. Although initially profitable, the traffic on the line was never as high as initially predicted, and by the 1990s was under one train per day. The railway had incurred much debt building the branch line, and the expensive, unprofitable operations on the branch line could not help to repay that debt. In 1984 BC Rail acquired the British Columbia Harbours Board Railway, a line that connects three class I railways with Roberts Bank, an ocean terminal that handles coal shipments. Since the line had been constructed in 1969, it had previously been leased to CPR, Burlington Northern Railroad, and Canadian National Railway in succession. =1990‚Äì2003= SD40-2s and a GE C44-9WL at Pemberton in 1995. In the early 1990s, the provincial government reduced subsidies to BC Rail. As a result, BC Rail, burdened with several money-losing services that it was required to operate, saw its debtload grow more than sixfold between 1991 and 2001. In the 1990s, BC Rail branched out into shipping operations, acquiring terminal operator Vancouver Wharves in 1993 and Canadian Stevedoring and its subsidiary, Casco Terminals, in 1998. In 1999 these operations became the three operating divisions of a new entity, BCR Marine. BCR Group became the parent company of both BCR Marine and BC Rail. In early 2003, attempting to reduce the railway's large debt, BCR Group sold its BCR Marine assets except for Vancouver Wharves (which was also not included in the subsequent sale of BC Rail to Canadian National, and remains a provincial Crown corporation). On August 19, 2000, the Quintette mine closed, and the portion of the Tumbler Ridge Subdivision between Teck and Quintette, British Columbia, was abandoned. The last electric locomotives ran along the line on September 29, 2000, after which the line was worked by diesels. The Bullmoose mine closed on April 10, 2003, after which the remaining of the Tumbler Ridge Subdivision between Teck and Wakely was abandoned, although the track is still in place. The electric locomotives were shipped south to Tacoma, Washington, where they are being dismantled by CEECO Rail Services. One of the locomotives (6001) was purchased by the Paul D. Roy family and they donated it to the Prince George Railway and Forestry Museum in Prince George where it is being preserved. Several other services were also discontinued around this time. The Royal Hudson steam train excursion was discontinued at the end of the 2001 excursion season. The 2860 was out of service in 2000, needing extensive repairs. The backup steam locomotive, a 2-8-0 locomotive built for the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1912, broke down in May 2001, and for the rest of the season BC Rail used a former Canadian Pacific Railway FP7A diesel locomotive #4069 that it had leased from the West Coast Railway Association in Squamish. Passenger train service, which consisted of the Budd-RDC operated Cariboo Prospector and Whistler Northwind (Pacific starlight dinner train) trains, ended October 31, 2002. The service was unprofitable, allegedly owing to BC Rail's heavy dependence on their fleet of aging Budd Rail Diesel Cars (RDC), which were becoming increasingly expensive to keep in service. Critics of the closure, which seriously harmed tourism and community life in communities along the line, maintain that the service was deliberately underfunded and mismanaged so as to lead to cancellation and pave the way for privatization.The Legislature Raids The RDCs have since been sold to various museums and operators around North America, (such as the Wilton Scenic Railroad in New Hampshire and the West Coast Railway Association in Squamish) Service between Seton Portage and Lillooet was replaced by a railbus. As well, around this time BC Rail ended its intermodal service.Schmidt. =Lease to CN= On May 13, 2003, British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell announced that the government would sell the operations of the railway (including all of the assets other than the rail right-of-way).Schmidt During the previous election, he had specifically promised not to sell the railway and he maintained that he was keeping this promise, by retaining ownership of the right-of-way and only leasing the land to the operator. On November 25, 2003, it was announced that Canadian National's (CN) bid of $1 billion would be accepted over those of several other companies, including the Canadian Pacific Railway, the BNSF Railway, and OmniTRAX.https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2011/12/27/BCRail/ The transaction was closed on July 15, 2004. The original lease of the rail right of way was for 60 years with a 30-year option to renew. However, it has been reported that there are another fifteen 60 year options to renew the lease in the contract documents and CN would not have to pay anything additional to keep operating for 990 years. At each of these renew dates, the BC government would have the option of buying back all of the assets from CN.Province of British Columbia Public Accounts 2004/05, p. 66. Retrieved 2005/05/12. Conversely, as of July 15, 2009, the fifth anniversary of the contract, CN has the right to decommission any part of the line it wishes but upon doing so the land reverts to the Crown though the Crown can sell it back to CN for one dollar if it wants to.http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/bcrail/BCRail_revitalization.pdf Since the sale (as of January 2013), Canadian National Railway has contributed $320,160 to the B.C. Liberal party.\\"Elections BC, Online Political Contributions System\\" The one portion of the BC Rail line not included in this sale was the Port Subdivision from Roberts Bank connecting to the main CN, CP and BNSF lines. Originally the operation of this line was to be sold off separately. However, there were a number of irregularities that came up during the sale process including a government employee, David Basi being accused of accepting a bribe from a lobbyist, Erik Bornmann, working on behalf of OmniTRAX who turned Crown witness in exchange for conditional amnesty, which enabled the RCMP to press charges against Basi. Another irregularity that surfaced in pre- trial hearings was that CP withdrew their bid because Canadian National had access to secret government information, including confidential information on their own corporate operations. The sale of the spur line was canceled and the remnants of BC Rail Company continues to operate and maintain this line. :See also BC Legislature Raids =CN era (2004- )= On August 5, 2005, a long CN train heading inland from Brackendale, derailed spilling 8 empty lumber flat cars and one tank car of sodium hydroxide. The tank car spilled its contents into the Cheakamus River, killing most of its fish. On June 29, 2006, a diesel locomotive hauling one flatcar of lumber down the steep Pavilion grade north of Lillooet had its air brakes fail at Moran. The train gathered speed, until it derailed over a steep gravelly slope; two of the three crew members were killed. Due to inaction by transportation safety authorities in taking CN to task, the Teamsters have launched a civil suit on behalf of the victims' families against CN for damages resulting from criminal negligence. In late March 2020, CN announced to its employees that it planned on abolishing through freight on the Lillooet Subdivision, between Williams Lake and Lillooet; as well as on the Squamish Sub, between Lillooet and Squamish. With some mills already curtailing operations and a further slowdown expected due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, on-line traffic did not warrant use of the 271-mile section of railway, which runs through treacherous and maintenance- intensive territory. On April 7, 2020, the last regularly scheduled freight train between arrived at the yard in Squamish. The remaining traffic in Williams Lake and points north is now moved to the Greater Vancouver area via Prince George and the CN mainline. On the Squamish Sub, CN has reportedly provided service to Continental Log homes in Mount Currie, and continues to use the line for railcar storage. Freight services The railway transported a wide variety of products, from resource traffic to intermodal freight. Forest products are one of the main products transported by the railway. Before the lease of operations to CN, the railway transported over 120,000 carloads of lumber, pulp, woodchips, and other forest products per year. The railway served several lumber and pulp mills in the province. Between 1983 and 2003, the railway hauled coal in unit trains from the Teck and Quintette mines near Tumbler Ridge to Prince George, from where CN would haul the trains to Prince Rupert for shipment to Japan. The Quintette mine, the larger-producing of the two, closed in 2000 and the Teck mine closed in 2003. Starting in the 1960s, the PGE operated an intermodal service that transported truck trailers between North Vancouver and Prince George, and to places further north. Unlike most of the railway's other traffic, most of the intermodal traffic was northbound. In April 1982, the railway combined its piggyback and less-than- carload (LCL) services to form a new Intermodal Services Department. BC Rail halted its intermodal services in 2002. Starting in 1958, the railway started to haul grain from the Peace River District, serving grain elevators at Dawson Creek, Buick, Fort St. John, and Taylor. With an amendment to the Western Grain Transportation Act in 1985 that included the railway in the Act, it became economical for the railway to transport grain, and it also carried grain from Northern Alberta bound for Prince Rupert, interchanging with CN at Dawson Creek and Prince George. From the 1920s to the 1960s, the railway also carried gold concentrate and bullion from the Bridge River goldfield towns of Bralorne and Pioneer Mine, which were trucked out of the goldfield area over the high Mission Pass to the railway at Shalalth. The main freight company operating out of Shalalth was Evans Transportation Co., which grew to be one of the biggest transportation companies in the province. In addition to gold concentrate and ore, Evans and other companies based in Shalalth carried passengers, heavy equipment, and supplies of all kinds over the Mission Pass. =Interchanges= Between 1928 and 1952, the PGE interchanges were difficult‚Äîat Squamish there was a barge connection to North Vancouver and the rest of the North American railroads; after 1952 the PGE could connect with CN at Prince George. Connections were made to other railways when the railway completed its Howe Sound link in 1956. The main connection to the North American rail network was in North Vancouver, where there was a connection to CN. There was also a rail connection to deep-sea terminal operator Vancouver Wharves, and some interchange occurred with the Union Pacific Railroad through the Seaspan railbarge link between North Vancouver and Seattle, Washington. The railway also interchanged with CN at Prince George, and with Northern Alberta Railways (acquired by CN in 1981) at Dawson Creek. CN's line between Dawson Creek, British Columbia, and Hythe, Alberta, fell into disuse in 1998, but CN agreed to reopen it as a condition of purchasing BC Rail. However, as of 2010 the line between Dawson Creek and Hythe is still disused. For many years the PGE owned and leased tugs to move boxcars: it had PGE Transfer No. 2, and PGE Transfer No. 3\\\\. It chartered tugs Lilloet, Dola, Prestige II and Squamish Chief. The PGE owned its own steam tug, the Point Ellice. The PGE also chartered CPR tugs and barges and moved boxcars to Coal Harbour and Seattle. =Reporting marks= Burlington Northern in 1992. Reporting marks are a system intended to help keep track of rolling stock and financial transactions between railways. The Pacific Great Eastern Railway used the reporting mark PGE. It later adopted the reporting mark PGER in 1971 for freight cars in international service. When the railway was renamed to the British Columbia Railway, it adopted the reporting mark BCOL. Initially, there was a distinction made between cars intended for local usage only (BCOL = BC On Line) and cars intended to be interchanged with other railways (BCIT = BC Interchange Traffic). Some cars, intended for use on the Northeast Coal connection were given BCNE. Passenger services BC Rail Budd Rail Diesel Car (RDC) Cariboo Dayliner Lillooet Since the line opened, the PGE had provided passenger service between Squamish and Quesnel (as well as between North Vancouver and Horseshoe Bay until operations were discontinued there in 1928). When the PGE reached Prince George and North Vancouver, daily service was extended to these cities. Service between Lillooet and Prince George was cut back to three times weekly in the 1960s. In 1978, the McKenzie Royal Commission recommended that the BCR eliminate its passenger services, which were losing over $1 million per year, unless it received government funding for them, but the BCR did not do so. However, facing large losses and an ageing fleet of Budd Rail Diesel Cars, it reduced passenger operations to three trains weekly to Lillooet and once weekly to Prince George on February 16, 1981. This service reduction led to public outrage, and the British Columbia government agreed to provide subsidies for passenger operations. The previous level of service was restored on May 4, 1981.Horton, p.16. Passenger service ended on October 31, 2002. BC Rail replaced the service between Lillooet and nearby Seton Portage and D'Arcy with a pair of railbuses, called \\"track units\\" by the railway. The railbus on the Kaoham Shuttle makes at least one round trip between Seton Portage and Lillooet daily, and also serves D'Arcy if there is sufficient demand. The Seton Lake Indian Band manages ticket sales, marketing, and customer service for the Kaoham Shuttle service. Excursion services The Whistler Northwind. The railway's best-known excursion service was its Royal Hudson excursion service, which was the only regularly scheduled steam excursion service on mainline trackage in North America. Excursion service started on June 20, 1974, running between North Vancouver and Squamish. By the end of the first season 47,295 passengers had been carried. The Royal Hudson would become one of British Columbia's primary tourist attractions. It operated between May and October. It was cancelled at the end of the 2001 tourist season.Wade Two other excursion services were introduced by BC Rail in 1997 and 2001. In 1997, BC Rail introduced the Pacific Starlight dinner train, which ran in evenings between May and October between North Vancouver and Porteau Cove. In 2001, BC Rail introduced the Whistler Northwind, a luxury excursion train that ran between May and October, northbound from North Vancouver to Prince George or southbound from Prince George to Whistler. The train used several dome cars built by Colorado Railcar. Both services were discontinued at the end of the 2002 season along with BC Rail's passenger service. Historically, and discontinued in the 1960s, the railway at one time operated open-top observation cars all the way from North Vancouver to Lillooet and sometimes beyond. A series of lodges of varying quality grew up along the railway, drawing on weekend tourist excursions from Vancouver via the MV Brittania steamer service to Squamish. The most famous of these was Rainbow Lodge at Whistler, then called Alta Lake, but others were at Birken Lake, Whispering Falls, D'Arcy, Ponderosa, McGillivray Falls, Seton Portage, the Bridge River townsite (where there was a first-class hotel serving mining and hydro executives and their guests), Shalalth, Retaskit and at Craig Lodge near Lillooet. The last-named was a swank tennis resort, its attraction being the extremely arid, sunny climate and the waters of Seton Lake. While BC Rail no longer operates the Excursion services, it did lease out its line to Rocky Mountaineer Vacations to use, operating two services over the former BC Rail route. The Whistler Sea to Sky Climb operates (until Spring 2016) between Vancouver and Whistler, which featured an observation car similar to the historical open-top car. The Rainforest to Gold Rush train operates north from Whistler via Prince George to Jasper. Both services are exclusively tourist-oriented and do not make local stops nor accept local-area travellers with fares significantly higher than former BCR passenger service rates. The West Coast Railway Association also returned the Royal Hudson #2860 to service during 2006. Locomotives Until the late 1940s, most motive power on the PGE was provided by steam locomotives. The majority of the railway's locomotives were of the 2-6-2, 2-8-0 and 2-8-2 (Whyte notation) wheel configurations. In addition, the railway also used a handful of gasoline cars, notably on a flatcar automobile ferry between Shalalth and Lillooet known simply as the Gas Car, once a vital lifeline for the communities of the upper Bridge River basin before the completion of a road from there to Lillooet. CN train with BC Rail locomotive at East Edmonton Junction The railway received its first diesel locomotive in June 1948, a General Electric 65-ton locomotive. Over the next two years the railway acquired six GE 70-ton locomotives. In the 1950s, the railway bought RS-3, RS-10, and RS-18 locomotives from the Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW). The railway had fully dieselized by 1956, and by the end of the decade had nearly 40 diesel locomotives. The railway would purchase new locomotives exclusively from MLW until 1980. During the 1970s, the railway also purchased several used locomotives, mostly American Locomotive Company (Alco) models from American railways. In the 1980s, the railway acquired new SD40-2 locomotives made by General Motors Diesel, as well as used SD40‚Äì2s originally made by General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD). In the 1990s and early 2000s, a number of locomotives were purchased from General Electric. Purchased new from GE were 27 C40-8Ms, 4 C44-9WLs and 10 C44-9Ws. Older, secondhand GE locomotives in the form of B36-7s, C36-7MEs, and B39-8Es were also purchased. In 1970, the railway started using remote controlled mid-train locomotives, allowing longer and heavier trains to be operated through the steep grades of the Coast Mountains. It initially used separate remote control cars to control the mid-train locomotives, but in 1975 it received eight M-420B locomotives from MLW. These locomotives were specially designed for mid-train operation. They contained remote control stations, and were cabless. A former BC Rail electric locomotive now on display at the Prince George Railway and Forestry Museum in Prince George, BC. The railway also leased seven GF6C electric locomotives made by GMD for use on the electrified Tumbler Ridge Subdivision from 1983 until electrification was removed in 2000. In 2004, the Paul D. Roy family purchased engine 6001 and they donated it to the British Columbia Railway & Forest Industry Museum in Prince George; the remaining six were scrapped. For passenger service, the PGE purchased seven Budd Rail Diesel Cars in 1956. Starting in the 1970s, the BCR started to purchase some used RDCs. The RDCs were retired in 2002, when BC Rail ended its passenger services. Royal Hudson locomotive No. 2860 at North Vancouver station before departure to Squamish in June 1996 Royal Hudson with CP 3716 at Squamish (1986) The BCR also used some historic locomotives for its Royal Hudson excursion service. The primary steam locomotive for the Royal Hudson excursion train was Canadian Pacific Railway No. 2860, a class H1 4-6-4 Royal Hudson. Made by MLW for the Canadian Pacific Railway in June 1940, it was the first locomotive built as a Royal Hudson. A sister locomotive, No. 2850, pulled King George VI's and Queen Elizabeth's royal train in 1939. After the tour, the King gave the CPR permission to use the term \\"Royal Hudson\\" for the class of locomotives. Between 1940 and 1956 it hauled transcontinental passenger trains between Revelstoke and Vancouver. Damaged in a derailment in 1956, it was refurbished and transferred to Winnipeg in 1957 for service on the prairies. It was withdrawn from service in May 1959, replaced by diesel locomotives. It was sold to the Vancouver Railway Museum Association in 1964 and was stored in Vancouver until 1973, when the British Columbia government acquired the locomotive from Joe. W. Hussey, who had purchased it three years earlier. It was restored and then leased to the British Columbia Railway, who used it in excursion service between 1973 and 2000. It was out of service during the 2001 tourist season, needing extensive repairs. The backup for No. 2860 was Canadian Pacific Railway No. 3716, a 2-8-0 built by MLW in 1912. During the 2001 season, when both steam locomotives were out of service, BC Rail leased No. 4069, a restored Canadian Pacific Railway FP7A diesel locomotive.

At the beginning of the Archaic period, the Early Hunters of the late Pleistocene era (50,000‚Äì10,000 BC) led nomadic lifestyles, relying on hunting and gathering for sustenance. However, the nomadic lifestyle that dominated the late Pleistocene and the early Archaic slowly transitioned into a more sedentary lifestyle as the hunter gatherer micro-bands in the region began to cultivate wild plants. The cultivation of these plants provided security to the Mesoamericans, allowing them to increase surplus of \\"starvation foods\\" near seasonal camps; this surplus could be utilized when hunting was bad, during times of drought, and when resources were low. The cultivation of plants could have been started purposefully, or by accident. The former could have been done by bringing a wild plant closer to a camp site, or to a frequented area, so it was easier access and collect. The latter could have happened as certain plant seeds were eaten and not fully digested, causing these plants to grow wherever human habitation would take them. As the Archaic period progressed, cultivation of plant foods became increasingly important to the people of Mesoamerica. The reliability of cultivated plants allowed hunting and gathering micro-bands to establish permanent settlements and to increase in size. These larger settlements required a greater quantity of food, consequently leading to an even greater reliance on domesticated crops. Eventually, the Mesoamerican people established a sedentary lifestyle based on plant domestication and cultivation, supplemented with small game hunting. This sedentary lifestyle reliant on agriculture allowed permanent settlements to grow into villages and provided the opportunity for division of labor and social stratification. The most important plant in ancient Mesoamerica, is, unarguably, maize. Squash and beans are also important staples of the ancient Mesoamerican agricultural diet and along with maize, are often referred to as the \\"Three Sisters\\".  Early and Culturally Significant Domesticated Plants  Cacao Richard S. MacNeish completed an extensive archaeological survey of Mesoamerica, during which he found the maize cobs in caves in Tehuacan, Puebla. It was originally suspected that these cobs date back to circa 5000 BC, however after radiocarbon dating it was determined that these finds date to 3500 BC. The earliest dated maize cob was discovered in Guil√° Naquitz cave in Oaxaca and dates back to 4300 BC. Maize arrived at this point through the catastrophic sexual transmutation of Teosinte, the ancestor of maize. It became the single most important crop in all of Mesoamerica. Maize is storable for long periods of time, it can be ground into flour, and it easily turns into surplus for future use. Maize became vital to the survival of the people of Mesoamerica; this is reflected in their origin myths, artwork, and rituals. The Maize God is depicted throughout Mesoamerica in stone figurines, carvings on altars, and even on temples, further signifying the importance of maize to the Mesoamerican peoples. Another important crop in Mesoamerican agriculture is squash. Bruce D. Smith discovered evidence of domesticated squash (Cucurbita pepo), in Guil√° Naquitz cave in Oaxaca. These finds date back to 8000 BC, the beginning of the Archaic period, and are related to today's pumpkin. Another important squash that was domesticated in the early Archaic period was the bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria). The bottle gourd provided storage space for collecting seeds for grinding or planting as well as a means of carrying water. Squashes provided an excellent source of protein to the ancient Mesoamericans, as well as to people today. Another major food source in Mesoamerica are beans. Maize, beans, and squash form a triad of products, commonly referred to as the \\"Three Sisters\\". Growing these three crops together helps to retain nutrients in the soil. Rubber trees and cotton plants were useful for making culturally significant products such as rubber balls for Mesoamerican ball games and textiles, respectively. Evidence of these ball games is found throughout Mesoamerica, and the performance of these games is related to many origin myths of the Mesoamerican people. The game had a ritualistic significance and was often accompanied with human sacrifice. The domestication of cotton allowed for textiles of vibrant colors to be created. These textiles are evidence of the Mesoamerican peoples' fascination with adornment and the cultural value they placed on appearance. Another culturally important plant was cacao (ancient Mesoamerican chocolate). Cacao was used in rituals (as a drink) and was also used as currency in trade. The crops above are only a few of the domesticated plants important to the ancient peoples of Mesoamerica. Please see the section below for a more comprehensive list of ancient Mesoamerican domesticated plants.

The two main ways to combat poor soil quality, or lack of nutrients in the soil, are to leave fields fallow for a period of time in a milpa cycle, and to use slash-and-burn techniques. In slash and burn agriculture, trees are cut down and left to dry for a period of time. The dry wood and grasses are then set on fire, and the resulting ash adds nutrients to the soil. These two techniques are often combined to retain as many nutrients as possible. However, in the jungle environment, no matter how careful a farmer is, nutrients are often hard to retain. To combat the lack of large tracts of usable land, farmers in Mesoamerica have found ways to create more land. The first way to create land is to form terraces along the slopes of mountain valleys. Terraces allow farmers to use more land on the mountain slopes, and to move further up the mountain than they normally would be able to. Some terraces were made out of walls of stones, and others were created by cutting down large trees, and mounding soil around them. There is evidence that the Maya and the Aztecs used raised fields in some of the swampy areas, and onto the flood plains. However, the Aztecs also created floating plots of land called chinampas. These were plots of mud and soil, placed on top of layers of thick water vegetation. This farming style was imperative to the growth and survival of the city of Tenochtitlan, due to its location. Much of the Maya food supply was grown in orchard-gardens, known as pet kot. The system takes its name from the low wall of stones (pet meaning circular and kot wall of loose stones) that characteristically surrounds the forest garden plot. The earliest dated maize cobs was discovered in Guil√° Naquitz cave in Oaxaca and dates back to 4300 BC. Maize arose through domestication of teosinte, which is considered to be the ancestor of maize. Maize can be stored for lengthy periods of time, it can be ground into flour, and it easily provides surplus for future use. Maize was vital to the survival of the Mesoamerican people. Its cultural significance is reflected in Mesoamerican origin myths, artwork, and rituals. The Mesoamerican natives also used irrigation techniques not unlike other early agricultural societies in early Mesopotamia. However, unlike the arid plains of the Fertile Crescent, the Mesoamerican area has a rougher terrain, therefore making irrigation less effective than terraced farming and slash-and-burn techniques. Slash-and-burn techniques are a type of extensive farming, where the amount of labor is minimal in taking care of farmland. Extensive farming uses less labor but had a larger mark on the area around them. In opposition, intensive agriculture refers to agriculture that requires large amounts of labor however yields continuous results from the same land, thus making it better suited for a sedentary lifestyle.

Each of these individual septs may further subdivide into more septs, which may sometimes lead to the development of novel surnames and/or the rise of the family such that it may be considered a clan in its own right. Such septs were common in Scotland, where the clan system was well-developed. Scotland In the context of Scottish clans, septs are families that followed another family's chief, or part of the extended family and that hold a different surname. These smaller septs would then be part of the chief's larger clan. A sept might follow another chief if two families were linked through marriage, or, if a family lived on the land of a powerful laird, they would follow him whether they were related or not. Bonds of manrent were sometimes used to bind lesser chiefs and his followers to more powerful chiefs. According to the Oxford Companion to Scottish History, the MacMartins of Letterfinlay who were a sept of the Clan Cameron would have seen themselves as distinct within their own lands, but would have also seen themselves as Camerons if operating elsewhere outside Lochaber.Lynch, Michael. (2011). Oxford Companion to Scottish History. p. 95. Oxford University Press. . Bonds of manrent and friendship tied obviously non-related kin groups into a wider military, political, and land/food resource sharing clanship. Today, sept lists are used by clan societies to recruit new members. Such lists date back to the 19th century, when clan societies and tartan manufacturers attempted to capitalise on the enthusiasm and interest for all things Scottish. Lists were drawn up that linked as many surnames as possible to a particular clan, regardless of whether there was an actual historical connection to that clan surname. In this way, individuals without a \\"clan name\\" could connect to a Scottish clan and thus feel \\"entitled\\" to its tartan. Also, common surnames, found throughout the British Isles, were linked to particular clans. For example, the surname Miller/Millar was made a sept of Clan MacFarlane, and Taylor of Clan Cameron. Furthermore, patronymic forms of common personal names were also linked to particular clans. This has led to the false impression that many surnames have one origin and are all related to one another, and that such surnames are historically connected to one particular clan. Ireland Historically, the term \\"sept\\" was not used in Ireland until the 19th century, long after any notion of clanship had been eradicated. The English word \\"sept\\" is most accurate in referring to a subgroup within a large clan, particularly when that group has taken up residence outside their clan's original territory (e.g. the O'Neills, MacSweeneys, and O'Connors). Related Irish clans often belong to larger groups, dynasties, such as the D√°l gCais, U√≠ N√©ill, U√≠ Fiachrach, and U√≠ Maine. Recently, Edward MacLysaght suggested the English word \\"sept\\" be used in place of the word 'clan' with regard to the historical social structure in Ireland, to differentiate it from the centralised Scottish clan system. This would imply that Ireland possessed no formalised clan system, which is not wholly accurate. Brehon Law, the ancient legal system of Ireland clearly defined the clan system in pre-Norman Ireland, with its electoral system limited to the senior sept's members (see derbfine), which collapsed after the Tudor Conquest in the 16th century. The Irish, when speaking of themselves, employed their term \\"clan\\", which means \\"children\\" in Irish.

Glucuronolactone is also found in many plant gums.  Physical and chemical properties  Glucuronolactone is a white solid odorless compound, soluble in hot and cold water. Its melting point ranges from 176 to 178 ¬∞C. The compound can exist in a monocyclic aldehyde form or in a bicyclic hemiacetal (lactol) form. :Lactol form of glucuronolactone  History  Glucuronolactone has received some notoriety due to an urban legend that it was a Vietnam War-era drug manufactured by the American government and since banned due to brain tumor- related deaths. However, the quoted British Medical Journal article does not exist; furthermore, no warnings appear on the Food and Drug Administration website regarding its potential to cause brain tumors or other maladies. Moreover, glucuronolactone is hydrolyzed in the body (like butyrolactone) to glucuronic acid, which may be oxidized to glucaric acid, or isomerized to another hexuronic acid, so there is no reasonable toxicity mechanism.  Uses  Glucuronolactone is metabolized to glucaric acid, xylitol, and L-xylulose, and humans may also be able to use glucuronolactone as a precursor for ascorbic acid synthesis. According to The Merck Index, it is also used as a detoxicant.Merck Index, 14th ed., 4467 The liver uses glucose to create glucuronolactone, which inhibits the enzyme B-glucuronidase (metabolizes glucuronides), which should cause blood-glucuronide levels to rise. Glucuronides combine with toxic substances, such as morphine and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, by converting them to water-soluble glucuronide- conjugates which are excreted in the urine. Theoretically, higher blood- glucuronides should help remove toxins from the body, leading to the claim that energy drinks are detoxifying.http://pilarmartinescudero.es/pdf/dopaje/Microgramredbull.pdf Free glucuronic acid (or its self-ester glucuronolactone) has less effect on detoxification than glucose, because the body synthesizes UDP-glucuronic acid from glucose. Therefore, sufficient carbohydrate intake provides enough UDP- glucuronic acid for detoxication, and foods rich in glucose are usually abundant in developed nations. Glucuronolactone is a popular ingredient in energy drinks with claims that it detoxifies the body. Although levels of glucuronolactone in energy drinks can far exceed those found in the rest of the diet, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has concluded that exposure to glucuronolactone from regular consumption of energy drinks is not a safety concern. The no-observed-adverse-effect level of glucuronolactone is 1000 mg/kg/day.

The boxcar, while not the simplest freight car design, is probably the most versatile since it can carry most loads. Boxcars have side doors of varying size and operation, and some include end doors and adjustable bulkheads to load very large items. Similar covered freight cars outside North America are covered goods wagons and, depending on the region, are called goods van (UK), louvre van (Australia), covered wagon (UIC and UK) or simply van (UIC and UK).  Use  Illustration of a boxcar being unloaded by hand Boxcars can carry most kinds of freight. Originally they were hand-loaded, but in more recent years mechanical assistance such as forklifts have been used to load and empty them faster. Their generalized design is still slower to load and unload than specialized designs of car, and this partially explains the decline in boxcar numbers since World War II. The other cause for this decline is the dramatic shift of waterborne cargo transport to container shipping. Effectively a boxcar without the wheels and chassis, a container is designed to be amenable to intermodal freight transport, whether by container ships, trucks or flatcars, and can be delivered door-to-door. Even loose loads such as coal, grain and ore can be carried in a boxcar with boards over the side door openings. Later grain transport would use metal reinforced cardboard which was nailed over the door and could be punctured by a grain auger for unloading. This was more common in earlier days; it was susceptible to losing much loading during the journey, and damaged the boxcar. It was also impossible to mechanically load and unload. Grain can also be transported in boxcars designed specifically for that purpose; specialized equipment and procedures are required to load and unload the cars. However, the grain is better transported in covered hopper cars. Originally made of all wood construction, with beam frame, and frame sides and roofs, the cars were a fire hazard. The beam frame was limited to a length. In the 1930s, pressed steel ends were added as were steel under framing. In the late 1960s the Federal Railway Administration outlawed wood cars and they were slowly removed from the fleet. With steel frames, longer box cars were possible and thus cars emerged. Heavy loads of cement or beer can make a boxcar load in the range. Livestock can be transported in boxcars, the standard practice in the U.S. until the mid-1880s. But, there is insufficient ventilation in warm weather. Specially-built stock cars or converted boxcars are preferable. Insulated boxcars are used for certain types of perishable loads that do not require the precise temperature control provided by a refrigerator car. Circuses used boxcars to transport their workers, supplies, and animals to get from town to town. Box cars were used for bulk commodities such as coal, particularly in the Midwestern United States in the early 20th century. This use was sufficiently widespread that several companies developed competing box-car loaders to automate coal loading. By 1905, 350 to 400 such machines were in use, mostly at Midwestern coal mines. Historically automobiles were carried in boxcars. But during the 1960s specially built autoracks took over. These carried more cars in the same space and were easier to load and unload. The automotive parts business has always been a big user of boxcars. Larger capacity \\"high cube\\" cars evolved in the 1960s to meet the needs of the auto parts industry.  Dimensions  The most common boxcars are to in length, to wide, and to high. A hi-roof boxcar is in height. These are inside (interior) dimensions. Corresponding exterior dimensions would be to in length, and to in width. = Boxcar loading gauges = File:Gabarit AAR Plate-B.pngAAR -Plate-B File:Gabarit AAR Plate-C.pngAAR -Plate-C File:Gabarit AAR Plate-D.pngAAR -Plate-D File:Gabarit AAR Plate E.pngAAR -Plate-E File:Gabarit AAR Plate F.pngAAR -Plate-F  Double-door boxcar  A double- door boxcar passes through Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. A Santa Fe door-and-a- half boxcar being loaded with the wing from the Spirit of St. Louis A double- door boxcar has two sliding doors on each side instead of one. Double-door boxcars can be more convenient for household storage and passage uses. The double door gives the user a wider range of options than a standard one. Door- and-a-half cars were used on the PRR, N&W;, B&O;, WSS, and CNJ railroads since the smaller opening did not require as much inside bracing.  Hicube boxcar  In the 21st century, high cubic capacity (hicube) boxcars have become more common in the USA. These are taller than regular boxcars and as such can only run on routes with increased clearance (see loading gauge and structure gauge). The excess height section of the car end is often painted with a white band to be easily visible if wrongly assigned to a low-clearance line. The internal height of the hicube boxcars originally used in automotive parts service was generally .  Passenger use  Hobos have often used boxcars in their journeys (see freighthopping), since they are enclosed and therefore they cannot be seen by railroad security or police, as well as being to some degree insulated from cold weather.

Following the Allied landing at Normandy in June, 1944, the Germans were pushed eastward towards the Rhine. Trains of Forty-and-eights were frequent targets of opportunity for Allied fighter-bombers, with carloads of prisoners occasionally being victimized.

The species looks somewhat similar to the yellow wagtail but has the yellow on its underside restricted to the throat and vent. Breeding males have a black throat. The species is widely distributed, with several populations breeding in Eurosiberia and migrating to tropical regions in Asia and Africa. The species is always associated with running water when breeding, although they may use man-made structures near streams for the nest. Outside the breeding season, they may also be seen around lakes, coasts and other watery habitats. Like other wagtails, they frequently wag their tail and fly low with undulations and they have a sharp call that is often given in flight. Taxonomy and systematics The binomial name of the grey wagtail Motacilla cinerea was introduced by Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 publication Ornithologia Britannica. A photo-lithographic reproduction of the original publication. Motacilla is the Latin name for the pied wagtail; although actually a diminutive of motare, \\"to move about\\", from medieval times it led to the misunderstanding of cilla as \\"tail\\". The specific cinerea is Latin for \\"ash- grey\\" from cinis, \\"ashes\\". The relationships of this species are not well resolved; it belongs to the non-African clade of wagtails, these are confusing in their external morphology, and mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data are not able to robustly resolve their relationships. While the present species is probably most closely related to citrine wagtails and some blue-headed wagtails, the exact nature of this relationship is unclear. Description Male M. c. melanope This slim wagtail has a narrow white supercilium and a broken eye ring. The upperparts are grey and the yellow vent contrasting with whitish underparts makes it distinctive. The breeding male has a black throat that is edged by whitish moustachial stripes. They forage singly or in pairs on meadows or on shallow water marshes. They also use rocks in water and will often perch on trees. They have a clear sharp call note and the song consists of trills. Distribution and habitat The bird is widely distributed across the Palearctic region with several well marked populations. The nominate form (includes caspica of Iran, Turkey and the Caucasus) is from western Europe including the British Isles, Scandinavia and Mediterranean region. Race melanope, which is not well separated from the nominate subspecies, is described as the population breeding in eastern Europe and central Asia mainly along the mountain chains of the Urals, Tien Shan and along the Himalayas. They winter in Africa and Asia. Race robusta breeds along the northeastern parts of Asia in Siberia extending to Korea and Japan. These winter in Southeast Asia. Island forms include patriciae of the Azores, schmitzi of Madeira and canariensis of the Canary Islands. They sometimes occur on the islands to the West of Alaska but have been known to occur further south in California as a vagrant. Behaviour and ecology Nominate race (Belgium) The breeding season is April to July and the nest is placed near fast running streams or rivers on an embankment between stones and roots. The male in display, makes short flights up into the air and descends slowly with fluttering flight accompanied by a rapid series of chipping high notes. In Europe the nests are often made in holes in manmade structures. The clutch consists of 3‚Äì6 speckled eggs and multiple broods may be raised with declining numbers in the clutch in subsequent broods. The usual clutch size is five in Ireland and the breeding success is about 80% with predation of eggs or chicks being the main cause of breeding failure. The Canary Islands population typically have smaller clutches and the breeding season is not as short and well marked as in populations at higher latitudes. The incubation period is about two weeks with chicks fledging within a fortnight. They live for a maximum of 8 years in the wild. Eggs, Collection Museum Wiesbaden In some parts of its range the white-throated dipper nests in the same habitats as the grey wagtail and there are some records of interspecific feeding of dipper chicks by adult wagtails. These birds feed on a variety of aquatic invertebrates including adult flies, mayflies, beetles, crustacea and molluscs. They often forage along roadsides in winter, flushing with a sharp chi-cheep call and flying up further along the road but after some distance turning back to return to the original location. In winter, they roost in small groups. Wintering birds have been known to return to the same sites, sometimes a small urban garden, each year. Adults often have parasitic ticks, Ixodes ricinus, which can harbour Borrelia and thus can potentially disperse Lyme disease over a wide region. Coccidia such as Isospora sp. are known in this species. The common cuckoo is sometimes a brood parasite of this species, and kestrels may sometimes prey on them.

It is a slender 15‚Äì16 cm long bird, with the characteristic long, constantly wagging tail of its genus. It is the shortest tailed of the European wagtails.

In the early 1960s she served as the recovery ship for two Project Mercury space missions, including John Glenn's historic first orbital flight. She was decommissioned in 1969 and sold for scrap in 1975. Construction and commissioning Randolph was one of the \\"long-hull\\" ships. She was laid down on 10 May 1943 in Shipway 10, at Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 28 June 1944, sponsored by Rose Gillette (wife of Guy M. Gillette, a US Senator from Iowa). Randolph commissioned on 9 October 1944, Captain Felix Locke Baker, USN in command. Service history =World War II= Following shakedown off Trinidad, Randolph got underway for the Panama Canal and the Pacific. On 31 December, she reached San Francisco where Air Group 87 was detached and Air Group 12 reported on board for four months duty.

Photographed from a floatplane. On 20 January 1945, Randolph departed San Francisco for Ulithi, from which she sortied on 10 February with Task Force 58 (TF 58). She launched attacks on 16‚Äì17 February against Tokyo airfields and the Tachikawa engine plant. The following day, she made a strike on the island of Chichi Jima. On 20 February, she launched three aerial sweeps in support of ground forces invading Iwo Jima and two against Haha Jima. During the next four days, further strikes hit Iwo Jima and combat air patrols were flown almost continuously. Three sweeps against airfields in the Tokyo area and one against Hachijo Jima followed on 25 February before the carrier returned to Ulithi. Riding at anchor at Ulithi on 11 March, a Yokosuka P1Y1 \\"Frances\\" kamikaze hit Randolph on the starboard side aft just below the flight deck, killing 27 men (including four reported missing and five transferred to the hospital ship where they died) and wounding 105 during Operation Tan No. 2. Repaired at Ulithi, Randolph joined the Okinawa Task Force on 7 April. Combat air patrols (CAP) were flown daily until 14 April, when strikes were sent against Okinawa, Ie Shima, and Kakeroma Island. The following day, an air support mission of fighters, bombers, and torpedo planes hit Okinawa and a fighter sweep struck an airfield in southern Ky≈´sh≈´. Under daily air attack from 17 April on, Randolph continued to send her aircraft on CAP and support missions throughout the month. In May, planes from the carriers hit the Ryukyu Islands and southern Japan, Kikai (Amami Islands) naval base and airfields, and Ky≈´sh≈´ airfields. Becoming the flagship of TF 58 on 15 May, Randolph continued her support of the occupation of Okinawa until 29 May, when she retired via Guam to the Philippines. On her next war cruise, as a part of Admiral Halsey's 3rd Fleet, Randolph made a series of strikes up and down the Japanese home islands. With Air Group 16 replacing Air Group 12, the ship launched eight raids on 10 July against airfields in the Tokyo area, principally those on the peninsula east of Tokyo Bay. On the 14th, her planes struck the airfields and shipping in and near Tsugaru Strait. In this attack, two of the important Honsh≈´-Hokkaid≈ç train ferries were sunk and three were damaged. Attacks on the Japanese home islands continued for the next few days, and on 18 July, the Japanese battleship ‚Äì lying camouflaged alongside a pier at the Yokosuka Naval Base ‚Äì was bombed. Moving southwest, Randolph and other carriers were off the coast of Shikoku on 24 July, for an anti-shipping sweep of the Inland Sea, during which the carrier-battleship was heavily damaged and airfields and industrial installations on Ky≈´sh≈´, Honsh≈´, and Shikoku were hit hard. Randolphs pilots estimated that from 10‚Äì25 July they had destroyed 25 to 30 ships, ranging in size from small luggers to a 6000-ton freighter, and had damaged 35 to 40 others. Randolphs strikes continued right up to the morning of the 15 August surrender, when her planes hit Kisarazu Airfield and surrounding installations. =Post-war= Following the end of the war, Randolph headed home. Transiting the Panama Canal in late September, she arrived at Naval Station Norfolk on 15 October, where she was rigged for \\"Magic Carpet\\" service. Before the end of the year, she completed two trips to the Mediterranean area to return American servicemen. Then, in 1946, she became a training ship for reservists and midshipmen, and made a Mediterranean cruise in the latter half of the year. After another voyage to the Caribbean, she embarked midshipmen in the early summer of 1947 for a cruise to northern European waters. Randolph was placed out of commission, in reserve, 25 February 1948, and berthed at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. USS Randolph after her SCB-27A modernization. In June 1951, Randolph commenced her SCB-27A modernization program at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. To handle the new generation of carrier aircraft, the flight deck structure was reinforced. Stronger elevators, more powerful hydraulic catapults, and new arresting gear were installed. The island structure was rebuilt, the anti-aircraft turrets were removed, and blisters were added to the hull. Reclassified CVA-15 on 1 October 1952, Randolph recommissioned on 1 July 1953. After shakedown off Guantanamo Bay with Carrier Air Group 10, she took on Carrier Air Group 14, departed Norfolk for the Mediterranean, and joined the 6th Fleet on 3 February 1954. Deployed to the Mediterranean for 6 months of Fleet and NATO exercises in 1954‚Äì1955, Randolph entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 18 June 1955 for installation of an angled flight deck and other SCB-125 modernizations. Leaving the yard in January 1956, Randolph conducted air operations off the East Coast for the next six months, and was the first Atlantic Fleet carrier to launch a Regulus guided missile from her flight deck. On 14 July 1956, Randolph again steamed east for a seven-month tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. When Israel, Britain, and France invaded the United Arab Republic in October of that year, Randolph stood ready. Operating near the Suez Canal, her aircraft provided air cover and surface and air reconnaissance for the evacuation of U.S. nationals from Alexandria. She returned to the United States on 19 February 1957. After a few months operating off the East Coast, Randolph deployed to the Mediterranean again on 1 July 1957. Between August and December, as political turmoil in Syria threatened to further disturb the already turbulent Mideast, she patrolled the eastern Mediterranean. Back in the United States on 24 February 1958, the flattop made her 5th Mediterranean deployment from 2 September 1958 ‚Äì 12 March 1959. Anti-submarine warfare Randolph was reclassified CVS-15 on 31 March 1959, and conducted anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations off the East Coast throughout that year and the next, receiving her fourth consecutive Battle Efficiency Award in September 1960. From October 1960 to March 1961, Randolph underwent the SCB-144 upgrade as part of the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization program. She received the new SQS-23 bow sonar, as well as improved displays in the Combat Information Center. LtCol John H.

Returning to the western Atlantic as the Cuban Missile Crisis broke, she operated in the Caribbean from the end of October through November. On 27 October, Randolph and a group of eleven United States Navy destroyers entrapped a nuclear-armed Soviet near Cuba and started dropping practice depth charges, explosives intended to force the submarine to come to the surface for identification. Allegedly, the captain of the submarine, Valentin Grigorievitch Savitsky, believing that a war might already have started, prepared to launch a retaliatory nuclear-tipped torpedo, but Second Captain Vasily Arkhipov persuaded the captain to surface to await orders from Moscow.Michael Dobbs, One Minute to Midnight, Vintage, Random House, 2009. Includes photograph of B-59 surfacing. After a Norfolk overhaul, Randolph resumed her station in the Atlantic. Over the next five years, she made two Mediterranean cruises and a northern European cruise, while spending most of her time off the East Coast and in the Caribbean. NASA ‚Äì Mercury Project In July 1961, Randolph sailed for operations in the Caribbean and served as the recovery ship after splashdown for astronaut Virgil Grissom on America's second manned space flight, a suborbital shot. In February 1962, Randolph was the primary recovery ship for astronaut John Glenn on his flight, the first American orbital voyage in space. After his historic three-orbit flight, he landed safely near the destroyer from which he was transferred, by helicopter, to Randolph. Elevator failure On 1 April 1964, in an unusual accident, the Number Three deck elevator of Randolph tore loose from the ship during night operations and fell into the Atlantic off Cape Henry, Virginia, taking with it a Grumman S-2D Tracker, five crewmen, and a tractor. Three crew were rescued by the destroyer , but two were lost at sea. Disposal On 7 August 1968, the Defense Department announced that it would inactivate Randolph and 49 other ships to reduce fiscal expenditures in 1969. Randolph decommissioned on 13 February 1969 at Boston Navy Yard and was laid up in the reserve fleet at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Randolph was stricken from the Navy List on 1 June 1973. In May 1975, the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service sold the ship to Union Minerals & Alloys for $1,560,000. Randolph was towed to Kearny, New Jersey, and broken up for scrap. One of her anchors is located on the river front in Toms River, New Jersey. Another anchor was placed at a Naval Reserve unit in Kingsport, Tennessee. That building was later designated for decom and destruction. With the blessing and approval of the Randolph Association, that anchor was kept in Kingsport and then relocated in 1990 to Sullivan North High School for representation of their newly commissioned NJROTC program. http://www.historicalmarkerproject.com/markers/HM1QNC_anchor- from-the-aircraft-carrier-uss-randolph-cv-15_Toms-River-NJ.html Her binnacle is preserved at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Museum.

Etymology The term citrine refers to its yellowish colouration. Taxonomy Its systematics, phylogeny and taxonomy are subject of considerable debate in the early 21st century. This is because this bird forms a cryptic species complex with the eastern (M. tschutschensis ) and western yellow wagtail (M. flava). Which of the many taxa in this group should properly refer to which population is unlikely to be resolved in the immediate future. Motacilla is the Latin name for the pied wagtail; although actually a diminutive of motare, \\" to move about\\", from medieval times it led to the misunderstanding of cilla as \\"tail\\". The specific citreola is Latin for \\"lemon yellow\\". Description It is a slender, 15.5‚Äì17 cm long bird, with the long, constantly wagging tail characteristic of the genus Motacilla. The adult male in breeding plumage is basically grey or black above, with white on the remiges, and bright yellow below and on the entire head except for the black nape. In winter plumage, its yellow underparts may be diluted by white, and the head is brownish with a yellowish supercilium. Females look generally like washed-out versions of males in winter plumage. Distribution This species breeds in the central Palearctic in wet meadows and tundra. It migrates in winter to South Asia, often to highland areas. Its range is expanding westwards, and it is a rare but increasing vagrant to western Europe. Vagrants seem to extend the migration rather than straying en route; in Bhutan for example, though along one of the species' migration flyways, the citrine wagtail has been recorded as an extremely rare passer-by rather than staying even for a few days or weeks. Ecology It is an insectivorous bird of open country near water, such as wet meadows and bogs, and nests on the ground, laying 4‚Äì5 speckled eggs.

Early life Felix Wakefield was born in 1807, the seventh child and sixth son of Edward Wakefield (1774‚Äì1854), a distinguished surveyor and land agent, and Susanna Crush (1767‚Äì1816) of Felstead. His grandmother, Priscilla Wakefield (1751‚Äì1832), was a popular author for the young, and one of the introducers of savings banks. He was the brother of: Catherine Gurney Wakefield (1793‚Äì1873), the mother of Charles Torlesse (1825‚Äì1866); Edward Gibbon Wakefield (1796‚Äì1862); Daniel Bell Wakefield (1798‚Äì1858); Arthur Wakefield (1799‚Äì1843); William Hayward Wakefield (1801‚Äì1848); John Howard Wakefield (1803‚Äì1862); Priscilla Susannah Wakefield (1809‚Äì1887); Percy Wakefield (1810‚Äì1832); and an unnamed child born in 1813. In 1831 Felix married Marie Bailley, by whom he had nine children. Life When he left school Felix began working with his father and training as a surveyor and civil engineer. This was interrupted, however, in 1826 as a result of the scandal surrounding his brothers, Edward Gibbon and William Wakefield and also his stepmother. When he eventually finished his training he rejoined his father, now in exile in Blois, France. Soon afterwards he impregnated a servant girl, Marie Bailley and was required to marry her. In 1832 the young family emigrated to Tasmania where Felix was employed as a surveyor. Although initially successful, Felix's work did not impress the authorities and such was his personality that when criticised he usually resorted to litigation and argument. As a result of this, he became extremely unpopular and eventually unemployable. Various attempts to recoup his fortunes were unsuccessful and by 1846 the family was destitute. Abandoning his wife and youngest child in Tasmania, Felix took the other eight children and returned to England. Most of the responsibility for supporting the family fell on his older sister, Catherine Torlesse, mother of Charles Torlesse, and brother, Edward Gibbon, who was himself recovering from a major stroke. But Edward Gibbon was also involved in the promotion and planning of a new scheme for the colonisation of New Zealand, the Canterbury Association, under the auspices of the Church of England and he persuaded himself that his brother Felix and his surveying skills had a contribution to make. The plan that Felix drew up for surveying the Canterbury Plains was largely adopted and contributed significantly to the early success of the colony. However, it was not easy, as Felix was just as hard to work with in England as he had been in Tasmania. Eventually, relations between the brothers were so bad that Edward Gibbon more or less wrote off his brother's debts, paid him a substantial sum of money, and sent him off to New Zealand. New Zealand Felix Wakefield arrived in New Zealand with six of his children in November 1851 and immediately began feuding with the agents of the Canterbury Association about the land allocated to him. There were also questions about various sums of money that he was unable to account for satisfactorily. A few months later he leased the store at Redcliffs, installed his children in the care of his eldest daughter, Constance, now twenty years old, and departed for Wellington. In Wellington, he met up with another brother, Daniel Bell Wakefield, resumed his campaign against Edward Gibbon, and started a new campaign aiming to have the administrators of the Canterbury Settlement replaced. Then at the end of March, after less than five months in the colony, he returned to London. There he continued his vendettas with such vehemence that he was summoned to appear in court, charged with uttering threats against the Canterbury Association's Land Agent, John Robert Godley. And then, just as precipitately, he returned to New Zealand. He arrived in Nelson, New Zealand in 1854, bringing with him two red deer. They thrived in New Zealand and went on to destroy much of the country's native forests. Felix returned to Canterbury where here his welcome was very cool. By August he was again in trouble, this time for attempting to evict the tenant from a building owned by his nephew, Jerningham Wakefield. Shortly afterwards he quit Canterbury, this time taking his children with him and returned to Nelson where they stayed for a short while before sailing once again back to England. He stayed away from New Zealand for ten years, during much of the time he was involved in litigation over various issues about land in New Zealand. He also served in the Crimean War, acting briefly as an engineer on the construction of the Balaclava Railway. He may also have been involved in the Indian Mutiny of 1857. Finally in January 1864 he returned to New Zealand, this time bringing with him a flock of skylarks. He settled in Nelson for a while, tried Canterbury for a period and then moved on to Wellington and then back once again to Nelson where in 1870 he was employed as a post office clerk until he retired in 1874. Wakefield died of a heart attack in Sumner on 23 December 1875. He is buried at Barbadoes Street Cemetery. His son Edward Wakefield was a New Zealand politician and journalist.

Life Leifs was born J√≥n √ûorleifsson, at the farm S√≥lheimar, then in the H√∫navatnss√Ωsla, northwestern Iceland. He left for Germany in 1916 to study at the Leipzig Conservatory. He graduated in 1921 having studied piano with Robert Teichm√ºller, but decided not to embark on a career as a pianist, devoting his time instead to conducting and composing. During this period he also studied composition with Ferruccio Busoni, who urged him to \\"follow his own path in composition\\". In the 1920s J√≥n Leifs conducted a number of symphony orchestras in Germany, Czechoslovakia, Norway and Denmark, thus becoming the only internationally successful Icelandic conductor to date, although he failed to obtain a fixed position. During a tour of Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland with the Hamburger Philharmoniker, he gave the very first symphonic concerts in Iceland in the summer of 1926 (a total of 13 concerts with different programmes). During this period, he was also very active as a writer on music and musical interpretation, both in German and Icelandic. Between 1925 and 1928, he travelled through Iceland on three occasions to record folk songs among the population in his home county H√∫navatnss√Ωsla in Northern Iceland. His observations on this were published in both Icelandic and German periodicals. Beginning with piano arrangements of Icelandic folk songs, J√≥n Leifs started an active career as a composer in the 1920s. From the 1930s he concentrated his efforts on the composition of large orchestral works, some of which were not performed until after his death. Most of his output is inspired by Icelandic natural phenomena. In the piece Hekla he depicts the eruption of the volcano Hekla which he witnessed. Dettifoss (Op. 57) was inspired by Dettifoss, Europe‚Äôs most powerful waterfall. In the Saga Symphony he musically portrays five characters from the classic Icelandic sagas. In 1935 J√≥n Leifs was appointed Musical Director of the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service. However, having found it difficult to implement his vision for the radio service, he resigned from the post in 1937 and returned to Germany. Gravesite of J√≥n Leifs at Fossvogsgar√∞ur cemetery in Reykjav√≠k. J√≥n Leifs married the pianist Annie Riethof soon after graduating from the Leipzig Conservatory. They had two daughters, Sn√≥t and L√≠f, and made their home first in Wernigerode. Since Riethof was Jewish, the family lived under constant threat of Nazi persecution. In 1944, the couple managed to obtain permission to leave Germany and moved to Sweden with their daughters. However, by this time their marriage was showing signs of strain and they divorced in 1946. J√≥n Leifs later married, and divorced, a Swedish woman, Thea Andersson. His third wife, who survived him, was √ûorbj√∂rg J√≥hannsd√≥ttir Leifs (1919‚Äì2008). She and J√≥n had one son, Leifur (b. 1957). In 1945 J√≥n Leifs moved back to Iceland (leaving his family in Sweden), and became a fierce proponent of music education and of artists‚Äô rights. This included working for the ratification by Iceland of the Berne Convention, which happened in 1947, and setting up the Performing Rights Society of Iceland (STEF) in 1948. In 1947 tragedy struck. J√≥n Leifs‚Äô younger daughter L√≠f drowned in a swimming accident off the coast of Sweden in 1947, aged only eighteen. Overcome with grief, he composed four works dedicated to her memory, including Requiem Op. 33b for mixed choir, perhaps his most celebrated piece. The other works are Torrek Op. 33a, for solo voice and piano, Erfilj√≥√∞ (In memoriam) Op. 35 for male choir, and the string quartet Vita et mors Op. 36. J√≥n Leifs composed his last work, Consolation, Intermezzo for string orchestra, as he had only weeks to live. He died of lung cancer in Reykjav√≠k in 1968.

Founded in 1946 as part of Sav-Way Industries of Detroit, Michigan, the discs were initially a hit, because of the novelty of the colorful artwork, and the improved sound compared to the shellac records dominant at the time. The discs were manufactured by first sandwiching printed illustrations around a core of aluminum, then coating both sides with clear vinyl upon which the grooves were stamped. The company went out of business the following year, having released between 67 and 74 double- sided 78 rpm gramophone records. Some of the Vogue issues were re-releases of recordings originally issued by other companies. The colorful artwork on the records have made Vogue Records a collector's item. Two releases on the Vogue label have been the source of much collector debate over the years: the 1946 releases by the country swing group the Down Homers \\"Who's Gonna Kiss You When I'm Gone?\\" and \\"Boogie Woogie Yodel\\" have often been cited as featuring the earliest recorded performances by future rock and roll pioneer Bill Haley, who was a member of the group in 1946. However this rumor was later debunked by surviving members of the Down Homers as well as Haley researchers. Nonetheless, the Vogue Down Homers releases are considered among the more collectable of the label's releases.

Tsang joined the colonial civil service as an Executive Officer in 1967, occupying various positions in local administration, finance and trade before he was appointed Financial Secretary of Hong Kong in 1995, becoming the first ethnic Chinese to hold the position under British administration. He continued to serve in the Hong Kong SAR government after 1997 and gained his reputation internationally for his intervention in Hong Kong's stock market in defending the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar during the 1997 financial crisis. Tsang became the Chief Secretary for Administration in 2001 and ran for the Chief Executive in 2005 after incumbent Tung Chee-hwa resigned. He served the remaining term of Tung and was re-elected in 2007. He served a full five-year term until he stepped down in 2012. In his seven years of term, he proposed two constitutional reform proposals in 2005 and 2010 and saw the second ones passed after he reached a compromise with the pro-democracy legislators, making it the first and only political reform proposals to be passed in the SAR history. He carried out a five-year policy blueprint and ten large-scale infrastructure projects during his term. His popularity began to decline after the introduction of the Political Appointments System which was marked by controversies and scandals. In the last months of his term, Tsang was embroiled by various corruption allegations. He was subsequently charged by the Independent Commission Against Corruption and was found guilty of one count of misconduct in public office in February 2017 and was sentenced to a 20-month imprisonment, becoming the highest officeholder in Hong Kong history to be convicted and imprisoned. His name was later cleared when the Court of Final Appeal unanimously quashed his conviction and sentence in June 2019, on the ground that the trial judge had misdirected the jury. Early life and government career Tsang was born in Hong Kong on 7 October 1944 to a Hong Kong police officer. His family ancestry is from Guangdong Foshan. He spent his childhood living in the Hollywood Road Police Married Quarters in Central, Hong Kong. After completing his secondary education at Wah Yan College, Hong Kong, a Jesuit school in Hong Kong, he worked briefly as a salesman at US drug company Pfizer Inc. before joining the civil service. Tsang joined the Civil Service as an Executive Officer in January 1967 and held many positions dealing with local administration, finance, trade and policies relating to the return of Hong Kong to China. In 1977, Tsang was attached to the Asian Development Bank in Manila for a year and worked on water supply and railway development projects in the Philippines and Bangladesh. He was subsequently sent by the government to complete a master's degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government of the Harvard University in 1981. Tsang was responsible for implementing the Sino-British Joint Declaration, signed in 1984 to decide the Hong Kong's sovereignty to be transferred to China in 1997, and the promotion of the British Nationality Selection Scheme as Deputy Secretary of the General Duties Branch between 1985 and 1989. In 1989, he was appointed Director of Administration to oversee the functioning of the Government Secretariat. In 1991 he became Director-General of Trade and in charge of all facets of trade negotiation and administration affecting Hong Kong. In May 1993, he was promoted to Secretary for the Treasury, responsible for the overall resource allocation, the taxation systems and the cost effectiveness of the Hong Kong government. Financial Secretary In September 1995, Tsang was appointed Financial Secretary, becoming the first Chinese to hold the position in 150 years of colonial history. He went on to become the first Financial Secretary in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on 1 July 1997. Shortly before the handover, he was knighted by Prince Charles at the Government House in June 1997. During his term as Financial Secretary, Tsang coined the term \\"caring capitalism\\" in 1996, which describe the governments's approach of giving priority to economic growth and then using the new-found wealth to develop social infrastructure and welfare services. Hong Kong's public spending grew steadily as public revenue remained robust and government budget in surplus. Public expenditure to GDP rose to as high as 23%, though still the lowest among developed economies. He also approved a raise in civil servants' salaries at the beginning of the Asian economic crisis. The salary raise was finally reversed, aligning civil servants' salaries to 1997 levels. Tsang was known for his role in defending the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar during the Asian financial crisis in 1998 from attacks by hedge funds led by George Soros who he dubbed \\"crocodiles\\". He joined hand with Joseph Yam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and bought over $15 billion in Hong Kong stock to defend Hong Kong's exchange rate and to make the government the biggest shareholder in many blue chip firms. Sir Donald‚Äôs action successfully led to the retreat of the hedge funds and earned his reputation internationally. Chief Secretary In 2001, Tsang succeeded Anson Chan who retired citing personal reasons to be the Chief Secretary for Administration, the second- ranking position in the government. It was widely believed that Chan resigned from the government in protest against Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa's introduction of the Principal Officials Accountability System, which made the capacity of the Chief Secretary from civil servant to political appointee. Under the new system, the power of the Chief Secretary as the head of the civil service was largely taken away by the Chief Executive and all ministers would only report to the Chief Executive directly. Donald Tsang found his major task as Chief Secretary was to implement Tung's order to launch a \\"Team Clean Campaign\\" to clean up the city in May 2003 after the SARS outbreak. As he was generally regarded as being sidelined by Tung, Tsang was untainted by major policy blunders, such as the controversy over the legislation of the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 which led to a historic massive demonstration on 1 July 2003. He remained topping in popularity polls among all the officials in Hong Kong as Chief Secretary. Chief Executive bid On 11 March 2005, incumbent Tung Chee-hwa announced his resignation, citing poor health. Tung's resignation was approved by the central government the next day and Tsang took over becoming the acting Chief Executive. After Tung's resignation, Tsang was tipped as Beijing's favoured next Chief Executive. On the afternoon of 25 May 2005, Tsang resigned as Chief Secretary and announced his Chief Executive candidacy on 2 June 2005 after his resignation was accepted by the central government. He was elected unopposed by the 800-member Election Committee on 16 June 2005 and was formally appointed by the central government as the Chief Executive on 21 June 2005. However, the term of the Chief Executive was disputed, which led to the interpretation of the Basic Law by the National People's Congress Standing Committee on 27 April to clarify that Tsang would only serve out the remaining two years of Tung Chee-hwa's term, rather than the full five years as some legal professionals argued. Chief Executive =First term (2005‚Äì07)= 2007/08 constitutional reform Tsang developed a warm relationship with the pan-democrats during the early months of his first term. Pan-democrat legislator Albert Chan gave his nomination to Tsang in the Chief Executive election, while Albert Cheng was seen as Sir Donald‚Äôs friend in the Legislative Council. Tsang also appointed some members from the pan-democracy camp to the government positions, including Lau Sai-leung to the Central Policy Unit which drew the criticism from the traditional Beijing-loyalists. On 30 August 2005, Tsang announced that the Guangdong Provincial Government invited all 60 members from the legislative council to visit Guangdong between 25 and 26 September 2005. This was the first chance for most of the pro-democrats such as Martin Lee to visit the mainland China since 1989. The Tsang administration's relationship with the pan-democrats deteriorated after the pro-democrats' rejection of the constitutional reform package in December 2005. Bounded by the decision by the National People's Congress Standing Committee in 2004 which ruled out the 2007/2008 Chief Executive and Legislative Council universal suffrage, the Tsang administration put forward a reform package which would expand the 800-member Election Committee to 1,600 members and add 10 seats to the 2008 Legislative Council, with five directly-elected through geographical constituencies and five functional constituencies elected by District Councillors. The government claimed that this was the best deal they could muster given the constraints of the NPCSC verdict. The proposal failed to gain two-thirds majority of the Legislative Council with four votes short, as 24 pan-democrats vetoed it. He angered democrats, who voted down his proposals, when he referred to them as \\"horrid animals\\".Yau, Cannix (22 December 2005), Back to square one for Tsang , The Standard Action Blue Sky Campaign In mid-2006 Tsang launched the \\"Action Blue Sky Campaign\\" and outlined a comprehensive plan to tackle air pollution in Hong Kong and in collaboration with the neighbouring Guangdong. Scepticism however remained among the expatriate and local population of Hong Kong and, in late November 2006, they ridiculed Tsang for citing the long life expectancy of Hong Kong residents as evidence of Hong Kong's high quality of life relative to other major cities in the East Asian region. =2007 re-election= Tsang announced he would seek for the second term on 1 February 2007 with the campaign slogan \\"I'll get the job done\\". He submitted his nomination on 16 February, with 641 of the 796 Election Committee members nominated him which guaranteed his electoral victory before the polling day. He faced challenge from the pan-democrats who backed Civic Party legislator Alan Leong to run against him. Tsang was elected by the 796-member Election Committee on 25 March 2007 with 649 votes, compared to Leong's 123 votes. It was seen as the first competitive Chief Executive election featuring two candidates from different political camp with debates held between the candidates which changed Hong Kong's political culture. =Second term (2007‚Äì12)= Five-year policy blueprint US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at the APEC Australia 2007. Following his re-election as the Chief Executive in 2007, Tsang set out the 5-year blueprint for the third term of the SAR government in his 2007‚Äì08 policy address. He stressed the importance of \\"progressive development\\", a core element of which is the promotion of community development through revitalisation of the built heritage in the city which is to be realised by promoting economic development through infrastructure projects. Ten large-scale infrastructure projects were also proposed within his term of office to boost economic activities to improve the living environment in Hong Kong: (1) MTR Southern District Extension; (2) MTR Sha Tin to Central Link; (3) Tuen Mun Western Bypass and Tuen Mun‚ÄìChek Lap Kok Link; (4) Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link; (5) Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge; (6) Hong Kong-Shenzhen Airport Co- operation; (7) Hong Kong-Shenzhen Joint Development of the Lok Ma Chau Loop; (8) West Kowloon Cultural District; (9) Kai Tak Development Plan; and (10) New Development Areas at Kwu Tung North, Fanling North, Ping Che and Ta Kwu Ling and Hung Shui Kiu. Heritage conservation The Tsang administration embattled with the conservation movement which reach its peak in the late 2000s, including the protests against the demolitions of the Star Ferry Pier and the Queen's Pier. In response to it, Tsang set up a Commissioner for Heritage Office and earmarked $1 billion to revitalise historic buildings. He also proposed a series of revitalisation projects that would add a new dimension to Central. For instance, to reduce the development density of the Central Ferry Piers site and open up the public space along the waterfront for entertainment, recreational and cultural uses; to remove the Central Market from the Application List and hand it over to the Urban Renewal Authority for conservation and revitalisation; and to convert the Murray Building into a hotel through open tender etc. Political Appointments System In 2008, the Tsang administration introduced the Political Appointments System, by superseding the Principal Officials Accountability System (POAS) and inserting two layers of politically appointed officials below the secretaries, who are political appointees. The appointees' foreign nationalities, experience and remuneration levels, and transparency of the selection process were widely criticism by the public, which led to Tsang to offer a public apology, saying: \\"With hindsight, I admit the arrangements in this regard did not fully meet public expectations, and I apologise for the controversy this has caused.\\" The controversy became the turning point of the popularity of the Tsang government. A poll showed Tsang's popularity declining sharply following the three-week row over the introduction of the Political Appointments System; his disapproval rating rose from 18% to a record 24%, while his approval rating declined from 66% to 60.8% in the space of three weeks.Eva Wu, \\"Chief's ratings fall\\", Pg A3, South China Morning Post, 11 June 2008 His approval/disapproval rating continued to deteriorate, and stood at 39/41% as at late August 2008. 2008‚Äì10 financial crisis After 2008 global financial crisis which led to the steep rise in unemployment especially among the banking and finance industries, Tsang announced on 8 December 2008 to create 60,000 jobs in 2009 by speeding up infrastructure projects and a ten- fold increase in its loan guarantee scheme for small and medium-sized enterprises. The Tsang government also quickly formed a Task Force on Economic Challenges to deal with the crisis. Tsang came up with six economic sectors to explore with the recommendations of the Task Force in his 2009‚Äì10 policy address: (1) testing and certification, (2) medical services, (3) innovation and technology, (4) cultural and creative industries, (5) environmental industry, and (6) educational services. The government pledged to provide more concrete support in those sectors and called them as the \\"new economic pillars\\". After a year of negative record of GDP growth rate, the Hong Kong economy recovered quickly from 2010, despite the poverty population keep growing under Tsang tenure.  Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link  In 2009, the government proposal of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link Hong Kong Section sparked concerns over the significant cost escalations compared to estimates made one year previously, the conservation of the Choi Yuen village and the increasing Mainland‚ÄìHong Kong integration. The government's plan drew more than 10,000 people protesting against the construction of the rail link in late 2009 and early 2010.Angry rail-link protesters clash with police , The Standard, 30 November 2009 Despite the controversy and strong opposition from the community, the Executive Council approved the implementation on 20 October 2009.ExCo approves implementation of high-speed rail link, Hong Kong Government, 20 October 2009 Appropriations for the project of $64 billion were passed by the Legislative Council on 16 January 2010 with the objections of the pro-democracy legislators.Song, Shengxia (18 January 2010), Hongkongers protest vote on high-speed rail, People's Daily, Global Times. Retrieved 28 January 2010 2012 constitutional reform The Tsang administration launched the proposals for electoral reform for the 2012 Chief Executive and Legislative Council elections in November 2009 which largely similar to the 2005 proposals.Chiang, Scarlett (19 November 2009), 'Don't miss this crucial step' , The Standard To oppose the proposal, five pan-democrat legislators resigned from the Legislative Council to trigger a territory-wide by-election in which they campaigned as the \\"Five Constituencies Referendum\\" for universal suffrage and the abolition of the functional constituencies. Following the by-election, the government stepped up efforts to gain support for the reform package. It commissioned two television advertisements which emphasised the need to move forwards with democratisation. Tsang began to campaign via radio interviews, and he and his ministers took to the streets to mobilise support. On the weekend of 29/30 May, Tsang and his ministers toured Hong Kong on an unpublicised itinerary to deliver flyers and meet the public.Moy, Patsy & Siu, Beatrice (31 May 2010). \\"Slow start in ground attack\\" , The Standard Tsang described as \\"myths\\" which surrounded the proposals ‚Äì that it is regressive, it makes little difference whether it is passed or not, and that ordinary people are not concerned by political developments. He said they were \\"the first step as well as the last opportunity\\" to lay the foundation for a chief executive elected by universal suffrage in 2017. He expressed his fear that \\"a mood of pessimism and cynicism will take root\\" if there was no progress this time.Moy, Patsy (31 May 2010). \\"Tsang turns up heat\\" Tsang also invited Audrey Eu of the Civic Party, the spokesperson of the \\"Five Constituencies Referendum\\" to a one-hour televised debate between on 17 June. Pundits were unanimous that Eu had trounced Tsang in the debate, with the University of Hong Kong poll showed that 45% of people were \\"more opposed\\" to the government's proposals after the debate, while 20% said they were more supportive.Bloomberg (18 June 2010). \\"Hong Kong‚Äôs Tsang Loses Democracy Debate, Polls Show (Update1)\\", Bloomberg BusinessWeek The central government made a U-turn on the moderate democrats' modified proposal tabled by the Democratic Party on 19 June, after South China Morning Post revealed that Donald Tsang had written a letter the previous week to Xi Jinping, vice- president in charge of Hong Kong affairs. \\"The chief executive warned in the letter that Hong Kong could face a serious governance crisis if the electoral reform package was vetoed by Legco again, and his ability to govern Hong Kong effectively would be in doubt\\". The SCMP source said Hu Jintao personally approved the Democratic Party's proposals.Cheung, Gary (22 June 2010) \\"Beijing's U-turn 'to thwart radicals'\\", South China Morning Post With the moderate democrats' support, the proposals were approved by the Legislative Council, making it the first and only electoral reform to be passed in the SAR history. Minimum Wage legislation Facing the increasing disparity between rich and poor in his term, Tsang set up a Minimum Wage Provisional Commission in February 2009 to research and eventually set a proposed wage floor. The Minimum Wage Bill was passed on 15 July 2010 and a HK$28 (~US$3.60) per hour rate was recommended by the Provisional Minimum Wage Commission and adopted by the Chief Executive-in-Council on 10 November 2010. Corruption allegations In the last months of his tenure, Tsang was embroiled in a series of corruption allegations. In February 2012 during the Chief Executive election in which contender Henry Tang, the former Chief Secretary in Tsang's government suffered in wide range of scandals, Tsang was also discovered by the Oriental Daily News to have received favours and hospitality from business tycoons on various occasions, including private jet and yacht trips and was labelled as \\"Greedy Tsang\\". The allegations of preferential allocation of a luxury three-storey penthouse in Shenzhen surfaced after Tsang addressed the press by saying that he and his wife had chosen to live in Shenzhen for a period after his retirement as they wanted to stay away from the limelight. Tsang was accused for allocating the Shenzhen penthouse owned by Bill Wong Cho-bau to Tsang in exchange for granting of a broadcasting licence to the Wong's Digital Broadcasting Corporation (DBC, then Wave Media).Luk, Eddie (27 February 2012). \\"Tsang denies license link to penthouse deal\\" . The Standard It was reported that Tsang was set to rent the flat at a substantially discounted rate while renovation works, provided by the developer, were tailored to the demands of Tsang's wife. Tsang argued that declaration was not necessary and that his lease did not affect the government's decision on granting the broadcasting licence to DBC. He also argued that the lease was at market value. Tsang was later summoned to answer questions from an open inquiry by the Legislative Council. This unprecedented revelations and move to impeach him launched by a pro-Beijing legislator Paul Tse shook the confidence in integrity of the city's officials.Luk, Eddie (29 February 2012). \\"Impeachment pressure grows\\" . The Standard. Tsang also set up an Independent Review Committee for the Prevention and Handling of Potential Conflicts of Interests chaired by former Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal Andrew Li on 26 February 2012 to review the existing frameworks and procedures for preventing and handling of potential conflicts of interests concerning the Chief Executive and other top officials. In the last month of his office, Tsang fought back tears as he offered \\"sincere apologies\\" on 1 June, when he said: \\"I know that my mishandling of the various events has undermined the community's confidence in the integrity of the system and has disappointed my colleagues in the civil service. For this I would like to, once again, offer my sincere apologies.\\" He stepped down as the Chief Executive on 30 June 2012 under the cloud of an investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Compared to his predecessor Tung Chee-hwa who was appointed vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) after stepping down as Chief Executive, Tsang was not appointed any position by the central government after his retirement. Conviction, imprisonment and acquittal On 5 October 2015, Tsang was charged with two counts of misconduct in public office after failing to disclose plans to rent a luxury penthouse for his retirement from Bill Wong Cho-bau applying for a broadcasting licence for the Digital Broadcasting Corporation (then Wave Media) by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), as well as failing to declare renowned interior designer Barrie Ho Chow-lai's engagement for decorating the penthouse when he recommended to the relevant government committee that Ho should receive an honour. An extra count of accepting an advantage from an agent for violating the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance over the Shenzhen penthouse was added on 11 October 2016. After entering pleas of not guilty to all charges, his trial began before a jury on 10 January 2017. On 17 February 2017, the jury found Tsang guilty on one charge of misconduct in public office over the penthouse rental and not guilty on the misconduct charge for the penthouse decoration, but failed to reach a verdict on the count of accepting an advantage from an agent. He was sentenced to a 20-month imprisonment on 22 February 2017. When he announced Tsang's sentence, Mr Justice Andrew Chan Hing-wai said \\"never in my judicial career have I seen a man fallen from so high.\\" On 24 April, Tsang granted bail by court after his health was fluctuating and had to be sent to the Queen Mary Hospital. Regarding the charge which had a guilty verdict, Tsang gets bail pending appeal. Regarding the charge which \\"failed to reach a verdict\\", a retrial was carried out, and the Judge dismissed the retrial-jury on 3 November 2017 after they too were unable to reach a verdict. Prosecution has not applied for a third trial. On 11 January 2019, Tsang was admitted to hospital for health reason, few days ahead of his scheduled release from prison. On 15 January, Tsang was released from hospital and also from jail. Upon his release, Tsang refused to compare his case with that of his successor Leung Chun-ying, who was also accused of corruption for his recipient of HK$50 million from Australian firm UGL without disclosure, even though Leung's case was dropped by the government in a controversial manner. \\"If I make comparisons, it may revive my anger and hatred in my heart. I have cleared these through working hard to pray and receive blessings from the heavens a few months ago,\\" Tsang said. He also said he would persist in seeking justice and clear his name. On 26 June, the Court of Final Appeal unanimously quashed his conviction and sentence, after finding that the trial judge had failed to direct his jurors properly. Personal life Donald Tsang and his wife Selina in 2008. Tsang is the eldest of the five sons and one daughter. His younger brother Tsang Yam- pui, retired as the Police Commissioner in December 2003, after a career with the police in which he worked his way up to the top job from the rank of Probationary Inspector. His younger sister Katherine Tsang is chairperson of Standard Chartered Hong Kong.Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited Appoints Katherine Tsang as New Chairperson , SCB press release, 10 January 2011Tsang sister moves up the ladder , The Standard, 11 January 2011 He married to Selina Pou Siu-mei in 1969 and has two sons, Simon Tsang Hing-yin and Thomas Tsang Hing-shun. Tsang is a devout Roman Catholic and goes to Mass every morning, though his political viewpoints were bluntly criticised at times by Joseph Zen, who was the Bishop of Hong Kong during Tsang's term as Chief Executive. Tsang is well known for his preference of wearing bow-ties. According to Associated Press, \\"the bow tie is such an integral part of Tsang's identity that he is nicknamed \\"Bow-tie Tsang\\". No byline, \\"Tsang loves his bow ties\\", article attributed to the Associated Press appearing in The Age, July 15, 2005, accessed January 18, 2007 His nickname is widely known among Hong Kong people. According to a television interview, this preference started somewhere between 1988‚Äì1993, when Tsang's office was adjacent to Deputy Political Adviser Stephen Bradley, who himself wore bow-ties. Tsang felt comfortable with a bow-tie Bradley gave him, saying that its design brings fewer hurdles to its wearer than a necktie.Episode 17, Be My Guest, originally broadcast on 23 September 2006 Tsang is well known for keeping koi. He had a pond built for them in the garden of his official residence, Government House, at a cost of HK$300,000. His other hobbies include swimming, bird-watching and hiking.

(1890) Umapine (Wakonkonwelasonmi), a Cayuse chief, September 1909 Cayuse woman, about 1910 The Cayuse are a Native American tribe in what is now the state of Oregon in the United States. The Cayuse tribe shares a reservation and government in northeastern Oregon with the Umatilla and the Walla Walla tribes as part of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. The reservation is located near Pendleton, Oregon, at the base of the Blue Mountains. The Cayuse called themselves the Liksiyu in the Cayuse language. Originally located in present-day northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington, they lived adjacent to territory occupied by the Nez Perce and had close associations with them. Like the Plains tribes, the Cayuse placed a high premium on warfare and were skilled horsemen. They developed the Cayuse pony. The Cayuse ceded most of their traditional territory to the United States in 1855 by treaty and moved to the Umatilla Reservation, where they have formed a confederated tribe. History According to Haruo Aoki (1998), the Cayuse called themselves \\"Liksiyu\\" in their language.Haruo Aoki (1998), A Cayuse Dictionary based on the 1829 records of Samuel Black, the 1888 records of Henry W. Henshaw and others, Manuscript. The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Their name Cayuse was derived from the French word \\"cailloux,\\" meaning stones or rocks, adopted by early French Canadian trappers of the area. The name may have referred to the rocky area the tribe inhabited or it may have been an imprecise rendering of the name they called themselves. The tribe has been closely associated with the neighboring Nez Perc√© and Walla Walla. The Cayuse language is an isolate, independent of the neighboring Sahaptin-speaking peoples. The Cayuse population was about 500 in the eighteenth century. The Cayuse were a seminomadic tribe and maintained summer and winter villages on the Snake, Tucannon, Walla Walla, and Touchet rivers in Washington, and along the Umatilla, Grand Ronde, Burnt, Powder, John Day River, and from the Blue Mountains to the Deschutes River in Oregon. Historian Verne Ray has identified seventy-six traditional Cayuse Village sites, most temporary, seasonal sites; five separate villages in the Walla Walla Valley and seven Cayuse Bands scattered throughout Eastern Oregon and Washington. The Walla Walla River Cayuse Band was called the Pa'cxapu. Other sources name only three distinct regional bands within the Cayuse at the time; two centered on the Umatilla River; the third on the Walla Walla River. The Cayuse were known for their bravery and as horsemen. They bred their ponies for speed and endurance, developing what is now called the Cayuse horse. No longer restricted to what they could carry or what their dogs could pull, they moved into new areas, traveling as far east as the Great Plains and as far south as California, to hunt, trade, fight, and capture slaves. Meanwhile, their herds multiplied rapidly, a combination of skillful breeding and periodic raids on other tribes. By the early 1800s, a Cayuse who owned only 15 to 20 horses was considered poor; wealthy families controlled 2,000 or more. Horses improved the range and effectiveness of war parties, making it possible for Cayuses to dominate their sedentary neighbors on the Columbia. They claimed ownership of The Dalles, the great fishery and trade emporium of the Columbia, forcing the weaker bands in that area to pay them tribute in the form of salmon and other goods. They frequently were in conflict fighting with Piute, Shoshone, and Bannock Tribes to the south and east referred to as the Snake people and other tribes such as the Blackfeet over territory and hunting sites. As white settlers moved into their territory in large numbers following the opening of the Oregon Trail in 1842, the Cayuse suffered. Even settlers passing through competed with them for game and water. Crowds of whites invaded the region during the California Gold Rush beginning in 1848 and when gold was discovered in Eastern Oregon in 1862. The tribe gained wide notoriety in the early days of the white settlement of the territory. In 1838, Marcus Whitman and his wife Narcissa established a mission among the Cayuse at Waiilatpu (\\"Place of the Rye Grass\\"), a site about seven miles from the present-day city of Walla Walla and about a quarter mile east of where the Cayuse P√°sxa winter village was located. In 1847, a measles epidemic, suspected by some to be contracted from white settlers, resulted in high fatalities among the tribe. A small group of Cayuse, after putting Witmans medicine to the test with both sick and non sick individuals, and which all test individuals died, believed the missionaries were deliberately poisoning their native people, since a much higher percentage of the natives were dying from the measles than were the whites. (Native Americans had no immunity to the endemic Eurasian diseases carried by European Americans.) In addition, cultural differences and settler encroachment had caused growing tensions. The Cayuse attacked the missionaries, killing Whitman and his wife Narcissa, and eleven others. They captured 54 European-American women and children and held them for ransom. They destroyed the mission buildings. This attack prompted an armed response by the United States and the Cayuse War ensued. The Cayuse put the captives to work together with their members; the adults made clothing for the tribe. They released the hostages after the Hudson's Bay Company brokered an exchange of 62 blankets, 63 cotton shirts, 12 Hudson Bay rifles, 600 loads of ammunition, 7 pounds of tobacco and 12 flints for the return of the now 49 surviving prisoners. The Cayuse and many from other nearby tribes such as the Walla Walla Tribe were hunted down by Militias and massacred. The Cayuse eventually lost the war. They were forced to cede their land to the US and shared a reservation with the Umatilla and Walla Walla. By 1851, the Cayuse had long intermarried with the neighboring Nez Perc√©, with whom they had sheltered; many learned their language. Kathleen Gordon a Tribal member of the Confederate Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation was a Cayuse/Nez Pierce Language instructor who spoke and taught the Nez Pierce language, but also knew small amounts of the Original Cayuse Language that is now extinct. In 1855, the Cayuse joined the Treaty of Walla Walla with the Umatilla and Walla Walla by which the Umatilla Indian Reservation was formed. Since that time, they have officially resided within the reservation's limits. During the mid- twentieth century, some members moved to cities under the Indian Relocation Act of 1956, an effort to give better access for contemporary jobs. Their number was officially reported as 404 in 1904; this number may be misleading. A count in 1902 found one pure-blooded Cayuse on the reservation. Descendants with ancestry partially of the other tribes may still have identified as Cayuse. The Cayuse language is believed to have become extinct by then. As the members of the three tribes have intermarried, they no longer keep separate population numbers. Lifestyle The Cayuse Indians were located in the Columbia Basin and were nomadic, sometimes moving on a daily basis. They lived in teepees, which many nomadic tribes used for portability. The Cayuse were skilled horsemen, and used horses in hunting. They also used them for their trip over the Rocky Mountains each year to hunt a supply of buffalo to bring back for their families. The men hunted game and fished salmon. The women gathered and picked berries and dug and processed roots. The women also processed the animal skins to make materials for shelter and clothing. The men considered bravery to be an important quality, with brave warriors being held in high esteem. The strongest would be made chief. Language The Cayuse language is a language isolate. Scholars have proposed that it may be related to Molala, making up a Waiilaptuan family ultimately related to the Penutian stock. This proposal is unproven. The language has been extinct since the 19th century. Wey√≠iletpuu is a dialect of the Nez Perce language as used by the Cayuse people of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. A distinctive dialect of the Cayuse people has not been used since the 1940s and is designated as extinct. Cuisine  One of the Cayuse's main food source was salmon from the Columbia River. Along with trout and eels, they also hunted elk, deer, as well as small game such as rabbits and fowl. Most significantly, women gathered camas roots, bitter roots, wild celery, huckleberry and choke cherry, processing them for cooked and dried foods for their survival. They also gathered bark, leaves, flowers, and roots for making medicine.

Ancestry Lewis was born in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. Through his mother, Alice Zeno, his maternal great-great-grandmother was a Senegalese slave who was brought to Louisiana around 1803. Zeno's family retained some knowledge of Senegalese language and customs until Alice's generation.Bethell (1977), p. 10-12 Personal George married Emma Zeno in 1918 in New Orleans they had 4 children, Mildred Zeno-Major born 1919-1996 Joseph Zeno 1921-2003 William( bill) Zeno 1923-1993 and George ( baby George) 1925-2005 Musical career During the 1920s he started the New Orleans Stompers. In that decade he also worked with Chris Kelly, Buddy Petit, Kid Rena, and was a member of the Eureka Brass Band and the Olympia Orchestra. In the 1930s he played with Bunk Johnson, De De Pierce, and Billie Pierce. He recorded with Johnson in the early 1940s and with Kid Shots Madison. Alan Lomax brought Lewis on a Rudi Blesh radio show in 1942 in which Lewis played \\"Woodchopper's Ball\\" by Woody Herman.Gary Giddins, \\"How Come Jazz Isn't Dead\\", p. 39‚Äì55 in Eric Weisbard, ed., This is Pop, Harvard University Press, 2004. (cloth), (paper), p. 43. Unable to make enough money as a musician, he worked loading and unloading cargo on ships at the docks of the Mississippi River. In 1944 Lewis was injured while working on the docks. A heavy container nearly crushed his chest. He practiced while convalescing in bed at his St. Phillips Street home in the French Quarter. His friends, banjoist Lawrence Marrero and double bassist Alcide Pavageau, brought their instruments to his bedside. Bill Russell brought his portable recorder and they recorded \\"Burgundy Street Blues\\", improvised blues song that was to become the Lewis signature piece. As Russell recorded Lewis, he occasionally gave new titles to interpretations of pop tunes, such as \\"New Orleans Hula\\" for \\"Hula Lou\\". These changes may have been made for copyright reasons, but occasionally it was because musicians reported the titles inaccurately to Russell. Lewis stayed with Johnson's band through 1946. This included a trip to New York City, where they played for dancing at the Stuyvesant Casino on Second Avenue. Band members included Johnson, Marrero, Pavageau, trombonist Jim Robinson, pianist Alton Purnell, and drummer Baby Dodds. While in New York, they recorded for Decca and Victor. After Johnson retired, Lewis took over leadership of the band, which included Robinson, Pavageau, Marrero, Purnell, Joe Watkins, and a succession of New Orleans trumpeters: Elmer Talbert, Kid Howard, and Percy Humphrey. Starting in 1949, Lewis was a regular on Bourbon Street clubs and radio station WDSU. His band was profiled in the June 6, 1950 issue of Look magazine with photographs by Stanley Kubrick. His reputation grew and he became a leader of the New Orleans revival. In the late 1940s and early 1950s his recordings reached the UK and influenced clarinetists Monty Sunshine and Acker Bilk. They became important contributors to the traditional jazz scene in the UK and accompanied Lewis when he toured the country. Lewis visited England in 1957, playing throughout the country with Ken Colyer's Jazzmen. In 1959 he returned, this time with his full band, and received a warm response. In 1959 he visited Denmark and played at Jazzhus Montmartre in Copenhagen. Beginning in the 1960s, he played regularly at Preservation Hall as leader of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band until shortly before his death. His performances were painted by New Orleans artists. Sitting portraits by Noel Rockmore were sold to collectors. Rockwell painted several musicians who had performed at Preservation Hall. John Van Beuren bought portraits that he put in other residences. His home in Morristown, New Jersey that was built by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe had portraits of George Lewis and Louis Nelson. Jazz critic Gary Giddins described Lewis as \\"an affecting musician with a fat-boned sound but limited technique\\".

Iberia, centered on present-day Eastern Georgia, was bordered by Colchis in the west, Caucasian Albania in the east and Armenia in the south. Its population, the Iberians, formed the nucleus of the Kartvelians (i.e. Georgians). Iberia, ruled by the Pharnavazid, Artaxiad, Arsacid and Chosroid royal dynasties, together with Colchis to its west, would form the nucleus of the unified medieval Kingdom of Georgia under the Bagrationi dynasty.Ronald Grigor Suny. The Making of the Georgian Nation. Indiana University Press, p. 13 .William Coffman McDermott, Wallace Everett Caldwell. Readings in the History of the Ancient World. p. 404. In the 4th century, after the Christianization of Iberia by Saint Nino during the reign of King Mirian III, Christianity was made the state religion of the kingdom. Starting in the early 6th century AD, the kingdom's position as a Sassanian vassal state was changed into direct Persian rule. In 580, king Hormizd IV (578-590) abolished the monarchy after the death of King Bakur III, and Iberia became a Persian province ruled by a marzpan (governor). The term \\"Caucasian Iberia\\" is also used to distinguish it from the Iberian Peninsula in Southern Europe. Name The provenance of the name \\"Iberia\\" is unclear. One theory on the etymology of the name Iberia, proposed by Giorgi Melikishvili, was that it was derived from the contemporary Armenian designation for Georgia, Virk ø (, and Ivirk ø [‘ª’æ’´÷Ä÷Ñ] and Iverk ø [‘ª’æ’•÷Ä÷Ñ]), which itself was connected to the word Sver (or Svir), the Kartvelian designation for Georgians. Yeremyan, Suren T. ¬´‘ª’¢’•÷Ä’´’°¬ª (Iberia). Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia. vol. iv. Yerevan, Armenian SSR: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1978, p. 306. The letter \\"s\\" in this instance served as a prefix for the root word \\"Ver\\" (or \\"Vir\\"). Accordingly, in following Ivane Javakhishvili's theory, the ethnic designation of \\"Sber\\", a variant of Sver, was derived from the word \\"Hber\\" (\\"Hver\\") (and thus Iberia) and the Armenian variants, Veria and Viria. According to another theory, it is derived from a Colchian word, \\"Imer\\", meaning \\"country on the other side of the mountain\\", that is of the Likhi Range, which divided Colchis and Iberia from each other; this is also the origin of the modern name Imereti.https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%83%98%E1%83%9B%E1%83%94%E1%83%A0%E1%83%94%E1%83%97%E1%83%98#Georgian History =Early history= Map of Iberia and Colchis by Christoph Cellarius printed in Leipzig in 1706 In earliest times, the area of Caucasian Iberia was inhabited by several related tribes stemming from the Kura-Araxes culture, collectively called Iberians (or Eastern Iberians) in Greco-Roman ethnography. The Moschi, mentioned by various classic historians, and their possible descendants, the Saspers (who were mentioned by Herodotus), may have played a crucial role in the consolidation of the tribes inhabiting the area. The Moschi had moved slowly to the northeast forming settlements as they traveled. One of these was Mtskheta, the future capital of the Kingdom of Iberia. The Mtskheta tribe was later ruled by a prince locally known as mamasakhlisi (‚Äúfather of the household‚Äù in Georgian). The written sources for the early periods of Iberia's history are mostly medieval Georgian chronicles, that modern scholarship interpret as a semi-legendary narrative.Stephen H. Rapp. Studies in medieval Georgian historiography: early texts and Eurasian contexts, vol 601. Peeters Publishers, 2003. , 9789042913189. P. 275. \\"While P‚Äôarnavaz may in fact be a fabrication, it is more feasible that over time the memory of the historical P‚Äôarnavaz accumulated a legendary facade.\\" One such chronicle, Moktsevay Kartlisay (‚ÄúConversion of Kartli‚Äù) mentions that a ruler named Azo and his people came from Arian-Kartli ‚Äì the initial home of the proto-Iberians, which had been under Achaemenid rule until the fall of the Persian Empire ‚Äì and settled on the site where Mtskheta was to be founded. Another Georgian chronicle, Kartlis Tskhovreba (‚ÄúHistory of Kartli‚Äù) claims Azo to be an officer of Alexander‚Äôs, who massacred a local ruling family and conquered the area, until being defeated at the end of the 4th century BC by Prince Pharnavaz, at that time a local chief. The story of Alexander's invasion of Kartli, although legendary, nevertheless reflects the establishment of Georgian monarchy in the Hellenistic period and the desire of later Georgian literati to connect this event to the celebrated conqueror.Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), Studies In Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts, pp. 141-142. Peeters Publishers, . =Pharnavaz I and his descendants= Pharnavaz, victorious in a power struggle, became the first king of Iberia (c. 302-c. 237 BC). According to the later Georgian chronicles, after driving back an invasion, he subjugated the neighboring areas, including a significant part of the western Georgian state of Colchis (locally known as Egrisi), and seems to have secured recognition of the newly founded state by the Seleucids of Syria. Pharnavaz is also said to have built a major citadel, the Armaztsikhe, and a temple to the god Armazi, and to have created a new system of administration, subdividing the country into several counties called saeristavos. His successors managed to gain control over the mountainous passes of the Caucasus with the Daryal (also known as the Iberian Gates) being the most important of them. The period following this time of prosperity was one of incessant warfare as Iberia was forced to defend against numerous invasions into its territories. Some southern parts of Iberia, that were conquered from Kingdom of Armenia, in the 2nd century BC were reunited to Armenia and the Colchian lands seceded to form separate princedoms (sceptuchoi). At the end of the 2nd century BC, the Pharnavazid king Pharnajom was dethroned by his own subjects and the crown given to the Armenian prince Artaxias who ascended the Iberian throne in 93 BC, establishing the Artaxiad dynasty of Iberia. =Roman period and Roman/Parthian rivalry= Iberia during the Roman Empire. This close association with Armenia and Pontus brought upon the country an invasion (65 BC) by the Roman general Pompey, who was then at war with Mithradates VI of Pontus, and Armenia; but Rome did not establish her power permanently over Iberia. Nineteen years later, the Romans again marched (36 BC) on Iberia forcing King Pharnavaz II to join their campaign against Albania. While another Georgian kingdom of Colchis was administered as a Roman province, Iberia freely accepted the Roman Imperial protection. A stone inscription discovered at Mtskheta speaks of the 1st-century ruler Mihdrat I (AD 58-106) as \\"the friend of the Caesars\\" and the king \\"of the Roman-loving Iberians.\\" Emperor Vespasian fortified the ancient Mtskheta site of Arzami for the Iberian kings in AD 75. The next two centuries saw a continuation of Roman influence over the area, but by the reign of King Pharsman II (116 ‚Äì 132) Iberia had regained some of its former power. Relations between the Roman Emperor Hadrian and Pharsman II were strained, though Hadrian is said to have sought to appease Pharsman. However, it was only under Hadrian's successor Antoninus Pius that relations improved to the extent that Pharsman is said to have even visited Rome, where Dio Cassius reports that a statue was erected in his honor and that rights to sacrifice were given. The period brought a major change to the political status of Iberia with Rome recognizing them as an ally, rather than their former status as a subject state, a political situation which remained the same, even during the Empire's hostilities with the Parthians. From the first centuries of the Christian era, the cult of Mithras and Zoroastrianism were commonly practiced in Iberia. Excavation of rich burials in Bori, Armazi, and Zguderi has produced silver drinking cups with the impression of a horse either standing at a fire-altar or with its right foreleg raised above the altar.Machabeli, pls. 37, 51-54, 65-66 The cult of Mithras, distinguished by its syncretic character and thus complementary to local cults within Georgian mythology, especially the cult of the Sun, gradually came to merge with ancient Georgian beliefs. It is even thought that Mithras must have been the precursor of St. George in pagan Georgia.Makalatia, pp. 184-93 Step by step, Iranian beliefs and ways of life penetrated deeply the practices of the Iberian court and elite: the Armazian script and ‚Äúlanguage,‚Äù which is based on Aramaic (see Tsereteli), was adopted officially (a number of inscriptions in Aramaic of the Classical/Hellenistic periods are known from Colchis as well,;Braund, pp. 126-27) the court was organized on Iranian models, the elite dress was influenced by Iranian costume, the Iberian elite adopted Iranian personal names,Braund, pp. 212-15 and the official cult of Armazi (q.v.) was introduced by King Pharnavaz in the 3rd century BC (connected by the medieval Georgian chronicle to Zoroastrianism)Apakidze, pp. 397-401 =Between Rome/Byzantium and Persia= Decisive for the future history of Iberia was the foundation of the Sasanian (or Sassanid) Empire in 224 by Ardashir I. By replacing the weak Parthian realm with a strong, centralized state, it changed the political orientation of Iberia away from Rome. Iberia became a tributary of the Sasanian state during the reign of Shapur I (241-272). Relations between the two countries seem to have been friendly at first, as Iberia cooperated in Persian campaigns against Rome, and the Iberian king Amazasp III (260-265) was listed as a high dignitary of the Sasanian realm, not a vassal who had been subdued by force of arms. But the aggressive tendencies of the Sasanians were evident in their propagation of Zoroastrianism, which was probably established in Iberia between the 260s and 290s. However, in the Peace of Nisibis (298) while the Roman empire obtained control of Caucasian Iberia again as a vassal state and acknowledged the reign over all the Caucasian area, it recognized Mirian III, the first of the Chosroid dynasty, as king of Iberia. =Adoption of Orthodoxy and Sassanid Persian period= Roman predominance proved crucial in religious matters, since King Mirian III and leading nobles converted to Eastern Orthodoxy around 317 and declared Orthodoxy as state religion. The event is related with the mission of a Cappadocian woman, Saint Nino, who since 303 had preached Orthodoxy in the Georgian kingdom of Iberia (Eastern Georgia). The religion would become a strong tie between Georgia and Rome (later Byzantium) and have a large scale impact on the state's culture and society. Iranian elements in ancient Georgian art and archeology gradually started to cease gradually as well since the adoptation of Eastern Orthodoxy in the same century. However, after the emperor Julian was slain during his failed campaign in Persia in 363, Rome ceded control of Iberia to Persia, and King Varaz-Bakur I (Asphagur) (363-365) became a Persian vassal, an outcome confirmed by the Peace of Acilisene in 387.Alexander Mikaberidze. Historical Dictionary of Georgia Rowman & Littlefield, 6 feb. 2015 p 528 However, a later ruler of Kartli, Pharsman IV (406-409), preserved his country's autonomy and ceased to pay tribute to Persia. Persia prevailed, and Sassanian kings began to appoint a viceroy (pitiaxae/bidaxae) to keep watch on their vassal. They eventually made the office hereditary in the ruling house of Lower Kartli, thus inaugurating the Kartli pitiaxate, which brought an extensive territory under its control. Although it remained a part of the kingdom of Kartli, its viceroys turned their domain into a center of Persian influence. Sasanian rulers put the Christianity of the Georgians to a severe test. They promoted the teachings of Zoroaster, and by the middle of the 5th century Zoroastrianism had become a second official religion in eastern Georgia alongside Eastern Orthodoxy. The early reign of the Iberian king Vakhtang I dubbed Gorgasali (447-502) was marked by the relative revival of the kingdom. Formally a vassal of the Persians, he secured the northern borders by subjugating the Caucasian mountaineers, and brought the adjacent western and southern Georgian lands under his control. He established an autocephalic patriarchate at Mtskheta, and made Tbilisi his capital. In 482 he led a general uprising against Persia and started a desperate war for independence that lasted for twenty years. He could not get Byzantine support and was eventually defeated, dying in battle in 502. =Fall of the kingdom= The continuing rivalry between Byzantium and Sasanian Persia for supremacy in the Caucasus, and the next unsuccessful insurrection (523) of the Georgians under Gurgen had severe consequences for the country. Thereafter, the king of Iberia had only nominal power, while the country was effectively ruled by the Persians. In 580, Hormizd IV (578-590) abolished the monarchy after the death of King Bakur III, and Iberia became a Persian province ruled by a marzpan (governor). Georgian nobles urged the Byzantine emperor Maurice to revive the kingdom of Iberia in 582, but in 591 Byzantium and Persia agreed to divide Iberia between them, with Tbilisi to be in Persian hands and Mtskheta to be under Byzantine control. At the beginning of the 7th century the truce between Byzantium and Persia collapsed. The Iberian Prince Stephanoz I (c. 590-627), decided in 607 to join forces with Persia in order to reunite all the territories of Iberia, a goal he seems to have accomplished. But Emperor Heraclius's offensive in 627 and 628 brought victory over the Georgians and Persians and ensured Byzantine predominance in western and eastern Georgia until the invasion of the Caucasus by the Arabs. =Arab period and restoration of the kingship= The Arabs reached Iberia about 645 and forced its eristavi (prince), Stephanoz II (637-c. 650), to abandon his allegiance to Byzantium and recognize the Caliph as his suzerain. Iberia thus became a tributary state and an Arab emir was installed in Tbilisi about 653. At the beginning of the 9th century, eristavi Ashot I (813-830) of the new Bagrationi dynasty, from his base in southwestern Georgia, took advantage of the weakening of the Arab rule to establish himself as hereditary prince (with the Byzantine title kouropalates) of Iberia. A successor, Adarnase IV of Iberia, formally a vassal of Byzantium, was crowned as the ‚Äúking of Iberia‚Äù in 888. His descendant Bagrat III (r. 975-1014), brought the various principalities together to form a united Georgian monarchy. Eastern and Western Iberians The similarity of the name with the old inhabitants of the Iberian peninsula, the 'Western' Iberians, has led to an idea of ethnogenetical kinship between them and the people of Caucasian Iberia (called the 'Eastern' Iberians). It has been advocated by various ancient and medieval authors, although they differed in approach to the problem of the initial place of their origin. The theory seems to have been popular in medieval Georgia. The prominent Georgian religious writer George the Hagiorite (1009‚Äì1065) wrote about the wish of certain Georgian nobles to travel to the Iberian peninsula and visit the local Georgians of the West, as he called them.

The Fabulous World of Jules Verne is considered the most successful Czech film ever made a it was soon after its release distributed to 72 countries in the world and received widespread attention. Marketa Lazarov√° was voted the all-time best Czech movie in a prestigious 1998 poll of Czech film critics and publicists.Marketa Lazarov√° on kfilmu.net (in Czech) History The first Czech film director and cinematographer was Jan K≈ô√≠≈æeneck√Ω, who started filming short documentaries in Prague in the second half of 1898. The first permanent cinema house was founded by Viktor Ponrepo in 1907 in Prague. =Interwar period= Among the most prominent directors were Karel Lamaƒç, Karl Anton, Svatopluk Innemann, P≈ôemysl Pra≈æsk√Ω, Martin Friƒç and Gustav Machat√Ω. The first Czech movie with synchronized sound was Tonka of the Gallows in 1930. Barrandov Studios was launched by Milo≈° Havel in 1933. It is the largest film studio in the country and one of the largest in Europe. During World War II the Czech film industry was taken over by the Germans, who made their own movies at Barrandov. Czech movies could only be made in a smaller film studio in Hostiva≈ô. =After World War II= Many prominent people of Czech cinema left the country before World War II including directors Karel Lamaƒç and Gustav Machat√Ω, cinematographer Otto Heller, actors Hugo Haas and Ji≈ô√≠ Voskovec and producer Josef Auerbach. Director Vladislav Vanƒçura was murdered by Nazis as were a popular actor and signer Karel Ha≈°ler, actress Anna Letensk√° and writer Karel Pol√°ƒçek. Studio owner Milo≈° Havel and actresses L√≠da Baarov√° and Adina Mandlov√° went into exile in Germany or Austria after they were accused of collaborating with Nazis during the war. In 1943 Czech Film Archive (NFA) was established in Prague. In 1945 the Czechoslovak film industry was nationalized. After a communist coup in 1948 only social realist movies were made. Most of the movies of 1950s were ideological, including historical movies, comedies and fairy tales. =New Wave= One the most famous Czech directors Milo≈° Forman In the early 1960s a new generation of filmmakers like Milo≈° Forman, Vƒõra Chytilov√°, Ji≈ô√≠ Menzel and Jan Nƒõmec started to make movies in opposition to social realist movies of the 1950s. After achieving success in international film festivals, these filmmakers were called Czechoslovak New Wave by foreign film journalists. Even directors who were not part of New Wave (e.g., Karel Kachy≈àa, Vojtƒõch Jasn√Ω, Franti≈°ek Vl√°ƒçil or Otakar V√°vra) made their best movies in the 1960s. Encompassing a broad range of works, the Czechoslovak New Wave cannot be pinned down to any one style or approach to filmmaking. Examples range from highly stylised, even avant-garde, literary adaptions using historical themes (e.g. Jan Nƒõmec's Diamonds of the Night) to semi-improvised comedies with contemporary subjects and amateur actors (e.g., Milo≈° Forman's The Firemen's Ball). However, a frequent feature of films from this period were their absurd, black humour and an interest in the concerns of ordinary people, particularly when faced with larger historical or political changes. Cinematic influences included Italian neorealism and the French New Wave can be seen in some of the Czech New Wave movies. After Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia New Wave slowly faded away. Many directors were fired from the state owned film studios (Jan Nƒõmec, Pavel Jur√°ƒçek, Evald Schorm). Others chose emigration (Milo≈° Forman, Ivan Passer, Vojtƒõch Jasn√Ω). Some movies that were critical of the Soviet regime were banned, e.g. The Ear, All My Compatriots and Larks on a String. =1970s to 1989= During the period of normalization, only the movies that Czech authorities considered harmless were made. Therefore the most successful movies from this era are comedies, sci-fi and family movies. A fairy-tale film from 1973, Three Nuts for Cinderella has become a holiday classic in Czechoslovakia and several European countries, including Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Sweden and Norway. =1990s and beyond= Among the most successful Czech films made after the Velvet Revolution are: Kolya, Divided We Fall, Cosy Dens and Walking Too Fast.

A male brothel, illustration by 237x237px Molly-house was a term used in 18th- and 19th-century England for a meeting place for homosexual men. The meeting places were generally taverns, public houses, coffeehouses or even private rooms where men could either socialize or meet possible sexual partners. Even if these clubs tended to display a heavy sexual connotation, some critics are reluctant to classify them as brothels. Rictor Norton, for example, argues that the regular customers could have been in fact mutual friends, at least at the beginning, since consistent evidence concerning male prostitution seems to be insufficient until the 1780s. At that time homosexual sexual activities were illegal and were heavily prosecuted; they remained capital offences until 1861. In this context, particularly during the 1720s, molly-houses came to be the scenes of raids and arrests, and their customers the ideal target for blackmailers. Molly-houses can be considered a precursor to some types of contemporary meeting places for the gay community. Etymology The word molly (also spelt as molley, mollie, mally) is a pet-form of the female forename Mary, and had two main connotations in 18th century English. The first one is close to the word moll, designating a lower-class girl or woman, occasionally a prostitute. The second one is classified as slang, defining an effeminate, usually homosexual, male.The Gay subculture in eighteenth century England Rictor Norton Quote: However, I think we have to exercise some caution and avoid jumping to the conclusion that just because we do not hear of the molly subculture or effeminate queens before 1700, therefore they did not exist until 1700. Along with the possible perception of intrinsic female features deriving from the association with the name Mary, another possible origin of this denomination for a homosexual man could be found in the Latin form mollis, indicating the supposed passive-effeminate partner in male homosexual relationships. In a 1762 Swedish/English dictionary by Jacob Serenius and in a 1767 French/English dictionary by Thomas Nugent the word was present, but simply defined a sodomite, without effeminate connotations. Other uses of the word can be seen in the verb to molly (to have homosexual intercourse), in the expressions mollycot (a British regional expression indicating man interested in activities traditionally associated with women) and Miss Molly (referring to an effeminate or homosexual male).  History  alt=A parodic cartoon depicting male and female thumb343x343px A parodic cartoon depicting male and female crossdressing,c. 1780, after a work by John Collet. =Gender issues in 18th century London = According to several critics, the English society of the time accorded high importance to the concepts of family and household as fundamental units for reproduction, subsistence and interaction between generations: in this context, male and female roles evolved into more static forms. Men were associated with an active, assertive role both in sexual behaviour and in managing the household, while women were defined in terms of their maternal functions, contrarily to a tradition common at the start of the century, attributing them features related to lustfulness and aggressiveness in sexual matters. It is possible to see that the notion of molly-house was rooted in the emergence of a distinctive identity according to gender and sexual orientation, a peculiar social phenomenon considered crucial by some critics in gender studies.Sex and the Gender Revolution, Volume 1, Heterosexuality and the Third Gender in Enlightenment London Randolph Trumbach; Quote: A revolution in gender relations occurred in London around 1700, resulting in a sexual system that endured in many aspects until the sexual revolution of the 1960s. For the first time in European history, there emerged three genders: men, women, and a third gender of adult effeminate sodomites, or homosexuals. As stated by Robert Shoemaker,... any activity (such as homosexual intercourse), in which [men] could be seen as acting passively was further marginalised. In fact, some of the activities popular among the homosexual community, that were seemingly taking place in molly-houses (by nature, marginalised meeting places), were often associated both to female roles and to a family environment (e.g. cross-dressing, marriage and mock birth rituals, as described in a satire work of the time, Edward Ward's Satyrical Reflections on Clubs, Chapter XXV Of the Mollies Club). = Molly-houses and the homosexual subculture in London = Covent Garden in 1747, in Louise Peter Boitard's satirical print The Covt. Garden morning frolick. Gaillardise du Commun Jardin. As sodomy was a capital offense, the organisation of homosexual men and their activities had to be a crucial point, in order to keep the community as safe as possible from prosecution. As a consequence, molly districts seemed to appear, and eventually grow, in areas in which their business could be acknowledged and tolerated at the same time: such connivance could be often found in areas with a high rate of criminal acts such as theft and prostitution. An editorial in The London Journal singled out a number of areas: * The arcades of Covent Garden and the Royal Exchange; * Moorfields (the path crossing the middle of these fields was known as the Sodomites' Walk); * Lincoln's Inn and its bog-house, as recorded in trials. * The south side of St James's Park, a popular cruising ground frequented by soldiers from the nearby barracks and homosexual habitu√©s. The presence of pillories punishing sodomitical offenses, ironically, identified the sites where such acts frequently took place. Pillories were often organised near the crime locations attributed to the accused. Molly-houses could be considered the most organised phenomenon of London 18th century homosexual subculture. They were enclosed, private spaces gathering individuals with a common purpose ie socializing and seeking pleasure with partners of the same sex. = Law enforcement and sources of information = Before 1533, the \\"unnatural sin\\" (also defined \\"detestable crime\\" in trial records) of sodomy or buggery, (a specific common law offence, meaning anal intercourse between a man and another man or woman, or anal or vaginal intercourse with a beast - in this way encompassing both sodomy and bestiality) was dealt with by the ecclesiastical courts. From that year however, the country's first civil sodomy law was introduced as An Acte for the punishment of the vice of Buggerie (Buggery Act 1533), and also criminal courts could prosecute individuals accused of such crimes. According to the Old Bailey Online Proceedings site: > In order to obtain a conviction, it was necessary to prove that both > penetration and ejaculation had occurred, and two witnesses were required to > prove the crime. Both the \\"active\\" and \\"passive\\" partner could be found > guilty of this offence. But due to the difficulty of proving this actual > penetration and ejaculation many men were prosecuted with the reduced charge > of assault with sodomitical intent. From the late 1690s to the early 1710s, the Societies for the Reformation of Manners (organizations born after the Revolution in 1688, seeking to eliminate immorality and disrespect for religion from public life) actively pursued prostitutes, Sabbath breakers and also homosexual men, through the means of spies and provocateurs to dismantle molly houses and prosecute individuals. In the 1720s and 30s thief-takers like Charles Hitchen and Jonathan Wild stimulated the Societies' activities. The peak of this wave of prosecution is to be recognized in the late 1720s with a raid on the most famous molly house, Mother Clap's. According to Rictor Norton: Molly-houses at that time were evidently and intrinsically related to since they gathered those who were called sodomites being a capital offence, so most of the information concerning molly-houses and the community around them is available through an indirect form, that is, mostly through newspaper reports and the accounts given during the Old Bailey trials relating to sexual offences, such as sodomy, assault with sodomitical intent and keeping a brothel, or sometimes the ones related to theft cases (for example, in cases with men caught stealing during a sexual encounter). Other important sources include satires and pamphlets, such as An Answer To A Late Insolent Libel by Jonathan Wild, Edward Ward's Satyrical Reflections on Clubs, Chapter XXV Of the Mollies Club, John Dunton's The He-Strumpets. A Satyr on the Sodomite-Club, James Dalton's A Genuine Narrative of all the Street Robberies Committed since October last. Later in the eighteenth century, waves of prosecutions can be identified in the 1750s and 1770s. However most of the details concerning sexual offences trials came to be more and more rare owing to a trend for a strait-laced morality, but fraud and extortion cases seemed to continue in giving retail at length detailed accounts of alleged sexual encounters between men. = Activities = The adoption of specific codes and rituals in relating to each other seemed to be another feature allowing cohesion in the group. These peculiarities were often described in trials and libels, often to be put on public display and disapproval. Some of the uses seemed to be: * the use of Female Dialect, and the assumption of female names, the Maiden Name tradition: the controversial figure of Charles Hitchen (alternative spelling: Hitchin) member of the Society for the Reformation of Manners, notable thief-taker, former Under City Marshal in London, was described as a regular in molly- houses according to a libel written by Jonathan Wild and also to be referred by using female names. > the Marshal was complimented by the Company with the Titles of Madam and > Ladyship. From James Dalton's A Genuine Narrative of all the Street Robberies Committed since October last: > Their chief Names are as follows. Ellinor Roden, China Mary, Flying Horse > Moll, Smal Coal Mary, Johannah the Ox-cheek Woman, Tub Nan,' Sukey Pisquill, > Garter Mary, Hardward Nan, Prety Criss, a Soldier of the 2d Regiment, Aunt > England, a noted Soap Boyler, Pomegranate Molly, Orange Mary, an Orange > Merchant near London-Bridge,'Old Fish Hannah,'Kate Hutton an old Man that > never wears a Shirt, Thumbs and Waste Jenny, Queen Irons, alias Pippin Mary, > Hanover Kate, spouse to Pippin Mary,Miss Kitten (Oviat), Rose Gudger, 'Black > Moll, &c.; They could take on a female persona, have a female name, and affect feminine mannerisms and speech. Again from Jonathan Wild: > The men calling one another my Dear, and hugging, kissing, and tickling each > other, as if they were a Mixture of wanton Males and Females, and assuming > effeminate Voices and Airs * Cross-dressing, from Jonathan Wild: > At the expected Time several of the sporting Youngsters were seized in > Women's Apparel, and convey'd to the Compter. Next Morning they were carried > before the Lord-Mayor in the same Dress they were taken in. Some were > compleatly rigg'd in Gowns, Petticoats, Head-cloths, fine lac'd Shoes, > furbelow'd Scarves and Marks; some had Riding-hoods; some were dressed like > Milk-Maids, others like Shepheardesses with green Hats, Waistcoats and > Petticoats; and others had their Faces patch'd and painted, and wore very > extensive Hoop-petticoats, which had been very lately introduced. * Marriage ceremonies: often a euphemism for sexual intercourse but sometimes actual ceremonies between a Mollie and his male lover, enacted to symbolise their partnership and commitment to each other. * \\"Mock-birth\\" rituals: during which a man dressed in a nightgown pretended to be a woman giving birth to a baby assisted by fellow Mollies as \\"midwives\\" ‚Äî a fact confirmed by other sources including trials. This ritual almost certainly originated as a couvade, designated to collectively relieve the extreme stress this particular social group was forced to live under. The ceremonies described by Ned Ward took place in specific periods called \\"Festival Nights\\", which other sources indicate took place towards the end of December. = Mother Clap's molly-house = Field Lane, 368x368px The most known molly-house in 18th century London was that owned by Mother Clap, which had been open from 1724 to 1726, when a raid sustained by the Societies for the Reformation of Manners had it dismantled. It was located in Field Lane, near to another tavern The Bunch of Grapes in Holborn, a suburban parish of Middlesex a short distance from the City of London. This area came to be renowned as a rookery in the next decades, and described as a sort of distinct town, or district calculated for the reception of the darkest and most dangerous enemies to society; in which when pursued for the commission of crimes they easily conceal themselves and readily escape. A literary example can be interpreted as a sort of confirmation of the reputation of this lane, since Charles Dickens placed here Fagin's den, an old Jewish man earning a living as a fence, in his 1837 novel Oliver Twist. This peculiar homosexual meeting place, however, became well known to the public during the 1720s through the trial of its keeper, Margaret Clap, indicted for keeping a disorderly house and for encouraging her customers to commit sodomy; and, particularly, through the account given by an agent provocateur, Samuel Stevens. > On Sunday Night the 14th of November. I went to the Prisoners House in > Field-Lane, Holbourn. I found near Men Fifty there, making Love to one > another as they call'd it. Sometimes they'd sit in one anothers Laps, use > their Hands indecently Dance and make Curtsies and mimick the Language of > Women - O Sir! - Pray Sir! - Dear Sir! Lord how can ye serve me so! - Ah ye > little dear Toad! Then they'd go by Couples, into a Room on the same Floor > to be marry'd as they call'd it. The Door at that Room was kept by - > Ecclestone to prevent any body from balking their Diversions. She and half a dozen of her customers were also put into the pillory, fined, and imprisoned for periods of up to two years. Three of her customers were hanged for sodomy: Gabriel Lawrence, a 43-year-old milkman; William Griffin, a 43 year old furniture upholsterer; and Thomas Wright, who was a molly house keeper. = Trials and personalities related to molly-houses = In the eighteenth century according to the Old Bailey Proceedings, only two individuals were formally arrested for keeping a molly-house: Margaret Clap and Julius Cesar Taylor but several accused of sodomitical practices seems to be reported as brothel keepers as well (i.e. Thomas Wright). On 9 May 1726, three men (Gabriel Lawrence, William Griffin, and Thomas Wright) were hanged at Tyburn for buggery following a raid of Margaret Clap's molly-house. Their trials are fundamental since they provide important details for the descriptions of the gay community surroundings. On 12 April 1727 Charles Hitchin was convicted of assault with sodomitical intent .  In popular culture  References and representations of molly-houses and gay subculture during the 18th and the 19th century London can be found in several contemporary productions. TV series * 2008: Episode 2 of the Channel 4 series City of Vice grants molly-house and mollies a predominant role. * 2010: Episode 2 of the second series of Garrow's Law, a BBC production set in and around London's Old Bailey courthouse, depicts legal issues surrounding gay life in the 18th century, including a molly-house in its settings. * 2013: Episode 2 of the NBC horror drama Dracula features a molly-house. * 2013: A molly-house appears in episode 3 of the first series of the BBC's Ripper Street, set in London's Whitechapel area in 1889. * 2017: A molly-house and related characters feature heavily in Taboo. * 2018: Several molly-houses (referred to as boy brothels within the series) and multiple characters are one focal point of The Alienist set in 1896 New York City. * 2019: A molly- house and mollies appear throughout season 3 of the Hulu series Harlots.

His older brother, Willard Foster, began playing banjo and guitar; George started out on a cello then switched to string bass. Foster married twice: to Bertha Foster in 1912 and Alma Foster in 1936. Pops Foster was playing professionally by 1907 and worked with Jack Carey, Kid Ory, Armand Piron, King Oliver and other prominent hot bands of the era. In 1921 he moved to St. Louis to play with the Charlie Creath and Dewey Jackson bands, in which he would be active for much of the decade. He also joined Ory in Los Angeles. He acquired the nickname \\"Pops\\" because he was far older than any of the other players in the band. In 1929 Foster moved to New York City, where he played with the bands of Luis Russell and Louis Armstrong through 1940. He gigged with various New York-based bands through the 1940s, including those of Sidney Bechet, Art Hodes, and regular broadcasts on the national This Is Jazz radio program. He also recorded for the Mezzrow-Bechet Quintet (Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, Fitz Weston, and Kaiser MarshallBillboard, May 1, 1948. Google Books.

In the late 1940s he began touring more widely and played in many countries in Europe, especially in France, and throughout the United States including returns to New Orleans and California. In 1952, Foster toured Europe with Jimmy Archey's Band. He played regularly at Central Plaza in New York and briefly in New Orleans with Papa Celestin in 1954. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he played with Earl Hines' Small Band. In 1966, he toured Europe with the New Orleans All-Stars but remained based in San Francisco, where he died. The Autobiography of Pops Foster was published in 1971, with a new edition in 2005.

It can also focus on modifying facial growth, known as dentofacial orthopedics. Abnormal alignment of the teeth and jaws is common. Nearly 50% of the population, according to the American Association of Orthodontics, has malocclusions severe enough to benefit from orthodontic treatment.: although this figure decreases to less than 10% according to the same AAO statement when referring to medically necessary orthodontics. There is a lack of strong scientific evidence for the health benefits of orthodontic treatment - a fact the academic journals and professional associations in the field of orthodontics were slow to admit. Treatment can take several months to a few years, it involves the use of dental braces and other appliances to slowly move the teeth and jaws around. If the malocclusion is very severe, jaw surgery may be used. Treatment is usually started before a person reaches adulthood since bones can more easily be moved around in children.  History  Orthodontics as a modern science dates back to the mid 1800s. Influential contributors to the field include Norman William Kingsley (1829‚Äì1913) and Edward Angle (1855‚Äì1930). Angle created the first simple system for classifying malocclusions, a system which is still used today. Until the mid 1970s, braces were made by wrapping metal around each tooth. With advancements in adhesives it became possible to bond metal brackets to the teeth instead.  Methods  Upper and lower jaw functional expanders A typical treatment for incorrectly positioned teeth (malocclusion) takes about 1 to 3 years to complete, with braces being altered slightly every 4 to 10 weeks by the specialists called orthodontists. Orthodontists are dental specialists who are University-trained in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of dental and facial irregularities. They provide a wide range of treatment options to straighten crooked teeth, fix bad bites and align the jaws correctly. Multiple methods exist for adjusting malocclusion. In growing patients there are more options for treating skeletal discrepancies, either promoting or restricting growth using functional appliances, orthodontic headgear or a reverse pull facemask. Most orthodontic work is started during the early permanent dentition stage before skeletal growth is completed. If skeletal growth has completed, jaw surgery can be an option. Sometimes teeth are extracted to aid the orthodontic treatment (teeth are extracted in about half of all the cases, most commonly the premolars). Orthodontic therapy can include the use of fixed or removable appliances. The majority of orthodontic therapy is delivered using appliances that are fixed in place, for example with braces that are bonded to the teeth with adhesives. Fixed appliances can have a greater mechanical control of the teeth and the treatment outcome is greater with the use of fixed appliances. Fixed appliances are, for example, used to rotate teeth that don't fit the arch shape of the other teeth, to move multiple teeth to different places, to change the angle of teeth, or to change the position of the root of the tooth. It is not preferable if the patient has poor oral hygiene (as that can result in decalcification, tooth decay, and other problems), if the patient isn't motivated (as treatment lasts several months and commitment to oral hygiene is required), or if the malocclusions are mild. = Braces = Dental braces. Braces are usually placed on the front side of the teeth, but may also be placed on the side facing the tongue (called lingual braces). Brackets made out of stainless steel or porcelain are bonded to the center of the teeth using an adhesive. Wires are placed in a slot in the brackets which allows for controlled movement in all three dimensions. Apart from wires, forces can be applied using elastic bands, and springs may be used to push teeth apart or to close a gap. Several teeth may be tied together with ligatures and different kinds of hooks can be placed to allow for connecting an elastic band. Clear aligners are an alternative to braces, but insufficient evidence exists to determine their effectiveness.  Treatment Duration  The time required for braces varies from person to person, depending on the severity of the problem; the amount of room available; the distance the teeth must travel; the health of the teeth, gums, and supporting bone; and how closely the patient follows instructions. On average, however, once the braces are put on, they usually remain in place for one to three years. After braces are removed, most patients will need to wear a retainer all the time for the first six months, then only during sleep for many years. = Headgear = Orthodontic headgear‚Äîsometimes referred to as an \\"extra-oral appliance\\"‚Äîis a treatment approach that requires the patient to have a device strapped onto his or her head to help correct malocclusion‚Äîtypically used when the teeth do not align properly. Headgear is most often used along with braces or other orthodontic appliances. While braces correct the position of teeth, orthodontic headgear‚Äîwhich as the name suggests is worn on or is strapped onto the patient's head‚Äîis most often added to orthodontic treatment to help alter the alignment of the jaw, although there are some situations in which such an appliance can help move teeth, particularly molars. Whatever the purpose, orthodontic headgear works by exerting tension on the braces via hooks, a facebow, coils, elastic bands, metal orthodontic bands, and other attachable appliances directly into the patient's mouth. It is most effective for children and teenagers because their jaws are still developing and can be easily manipulated. (If an adult is fitted with headgear, it is usually to help correct the position of teeth that have shifted after other teeth have been extracted.) Thus Headgear is typically used to treat a number of jaw alignment or bite problems such as overbite and underbite. = Palatal expansion = Palatal expansion can be achieved using either fixed or removable appliances.\\" = Jaw surgery = Jaw surgery may be required to fix severe malocclusions. The bone is broken during surgery and is stabilised with titanium (or bioresorbable) plates and screws to allow for healing to take place. After surgery, regular orthodontic treatment is used to move the teeth into their final position. = During treatment = To reduce pain during the orthodontic treatment, low level laser therapy (LLLT), vibratory devices, chewing adjuncts, brainwave musics or cognitive behavioral therapy can be used. However, the supporting evidence is of low quality and the results are inconclusive. =Post treatment= After orthodontic treatment has completed, there is a tendency for teeth to return, or relapse, back to their pre-treatment positions. Over 50% of patients have some reversion to pre-treatment positions within 10 years following treatment. To prevent relapse, the majority of patients will be offered a retainer once treatment has completed, and will benefit from wearing their retainers. Retainers can be either fixed or removable.  Removable retainers  Removable retainers are made from a clear plastic, and they are custom-fitted for the patient's mouth. It has a tight fit and holds all of the teeth in position. There are many types of brands for clear retainers including, Zendura Retainer, Essix Retainer and Vivera Retainer. Hawley retainer is also a removable orthodontic appliance made from a combination of plastic and metal that is molded custom to fit the patient's mouth. Removable retainers will be worn for different periods of time depending on patient need to stabilise the dentition.  Fixed retainers  Fixed retainers are a simple wire fixed to the tongue-facing part of the incisors using dental adhesive and can be specifically useful to prevent rotation in incisors. Other types of fixed retainers can include labial or lingual braces, with brackets fixed to the teeth.

Specifically, the American Dental Association recognized orthodontics as a speciality in the 1950s. Each country has their own system for training and registering orthodontic specialists. =Australia= In Australia, to obtain an accredited three-year full-time university degree in orthodontics you will need to be a qualified dentist (complete an AHPRA registered general dental degree) with a minimum of two years clinical experience. There are several universities in Australia that offer orthodontic programs: University of Adelaide, University of Melbourne, University of Sydney, University of Queensland, University of Western Australia, University of Otago. Orthodontic Courses are accredited by the Australian Dental Council and reviewed by the Australian Society of Orthodontists (ASO). Prospective applicants should obtain information from the relevant institution before applying for admission. After completing a degree in orthodontics, specialists are required to be registered with the Australian Health Practitioners Regulation Agency (AHPRA) in order to practise. =Bangladesh= Dhaka Dental College in Bangladesh is one of the many schools recognized by the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BM&DC;) that offer post-graduation orthodontic courses. Before applying to any post-graduation training courses, an applicant must have completed the Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) examination from any dental college. After application, the applicant must take an admissions test held by the specific college. When successful, selected candidates undergo training for six months. = Canada = In Canada, obtaining a dental degree, such as a Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) or Doctor of Medical Dentistry (DMD), would be required before being accepted by a school for orthodontic training. Currently, there are 10 schools in the country offering the orthodontic specialty. Candidates should contact the individual school directly to obtain the most recent pre-requisites before entry. The Canadian Dental Association expects orthodontists to complete at least two years of post-doctoral, specialty training in orthodontics in an accredited program, after graduating from their dental degree. = Pakistan = In Pakistan to be enrolled as a student or resident in postgraduation orthodontic course approved by Pakistan Medical and Dental Council, the dentist must graduate with a Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) or equivalent degree. Pakistan Medical & Dental Council (PMDC) has a recognized program in Orthodontics as Master in Dental Surgery (MDS) orthodontics and FCPS orthodontics as 4 years post graduate degree programs, the latter of which is conducted by CPSP Pakistan. =United States= Similar to Canada, there are several colleges and universities in the United States that offer orthodontic programs. Every school has a different enrollment process, but every applicant is required to have graduated with a DDS or DMD from an accredited dental school. Entrance into an accredited orthodontics program is extremely competitive, and begins by passing a national or state licensing exam. The program generally lasts for two to three years, and by the final year, graduates are to complete the written American Board of Orthodontics (ABO) exam. This exam is also broken down into two components: a written exam and a clinical exam. The written exam is a comprehensive exam that tests for the applicant's knowledge of basic sciences and clinical concepts. The clinical exam, however, consists of a Board Case Oral Examination (BCOE), a Case Report Examination (CRE), and a Case Report Oral Examination (CROE). Once certified, certification must then be renewed every ten years. Orthodontic programs can award the Master of Science degree, Doctor of Science degree, or Doctor of Philosophy degree depending on the school and individual research requirements. =United Kingdom= Throughout the United Kingdom, there are several Orthodontic Specialty Training Registrar posts available.https://www.bos.org.uk/Portals/0/Public/docs/Careers/guidelines-on- orthodontic-specialty-training.pdf \\"Orthodontic Specialty Training in the UK\\" (PDF). British Orthodontic Society. British Orthodontic Society. Retrieved 28 October 2017. The program is full-time for three years, and upon completion, trainees graduate with a degree at the Masters or Doctorate level. Training may take place within hospital departments that are linked to recognized dental schools. Obtaining a Certificate of Completion of Specialty Training (CCST) allows an orthodontic specialist to be registered under the General Dental Council (GDC). An orthodontic specialist can provide care within a primary care setting, but to work at a hospital as an orthodontic consultant, higher level training is further required as a post-CCST trainee. To work within a university setting, as an academic consultant, completing research toward obtaining a PhD is also required.

He was also the 1st Prince Murat, Grand Duke of Berg from 1806 to 1808, and King of Naples from 1808 to 1815. Murat received his titles in part by being Napoleon's brother-in-law through marriage to his younger sister, Caroline Bonaparte, as well as personal merit. He was noted as a daring, brave, and charismatic cavalry officer as well as a flamboyant dresser, for which he was known as \\"the Dandy King\\". Early life Murat was born on 25 March 1767 in La Bastide-Fortuni√®reChavanon, Jules and Georges Saint-Yves, Joachim Murat (1767‚Äì1815), (Libraire Hachette, 1905), 4. (renamed Labastide-Murat after its renowned citizen), in Guyenne (present-day Lot department of France) to Pierre Murat-Jordy (d. 27 July 1799), an affluent yeomanFisher, Herbert A. L., Studies in Napoleonic Statesmanship Germany (Chap. IX The Foundation of the Grand-Duchy of Berg), p. 174, Ardent Media, 1968. innkeeper, postmaster and Roman Catholic churchwarden, and his wife Jeanne Loubi√®res (1722 ‚Äì 11 March 1806), daughter of Pierre Loubi√®res and of his wife Jeanne Viellescazes. Pierre Murat-Jordy was the son of Guillaume Murat (1692‚Äì1754) and his wife Marguerite Herbeil (d. 1755), paternal grandson of Pierre Murat (b. 1634) and his wife Catherine Badour√®s (d. 1697), and maternal grandson of Bertrand Herbeil and his wife Anne Roques. Murat's parents intended that he pursue a vocation in the church, and he was taught by the parish priest, after which he won a place at the College of Saint-Michel at Cahors when he was ten years old. He then entered the seminary of the Lazarists at Toulouse, but when a regiment of cavalry passed through the city in 1787, he ran away and enlisted on 23 February 1787 in the Chasseurs des Ardennes, which the following year became known as the Chasseurs de Champagne, or the 12th Chasseurs. In 1789, an affair forced him to resign, and he returned to his family, becoming a clerk to a haberdasher at Saint-Cer√©.Phipps, p. 146 French Revolutionary Wars sous-lieutenant of the 12th Chasseur-√†-Cheval, by Jean-Baptiste Paulin Gu√©rin By 1790, Murat had joined the National Guard, and the Canton of Montaucon sent him as its representative to the celebration of the first anniversary of Bastille Day (la F√™te nationale). He was subsequently reinstated in his former regiment. Because part of the 12th Chasseurs had been sent to Montm√©dy to protect the royal family on its flight to Varennes, the regiment had to defend its honor and loyalty to the Republic; Murat and the regiment's adjutant made a speech to the assembly at Toul to that effect.Phipps, p. 146. In 1792, Murat joined the Constitutional Guard, but left it that same year. His departure was attributed to various causes, including his constant quarreling and dueling, although he claimed he left to avoid punishment for being absent without leave.Phipps, p. 147. An ardent Republican, Murat wrote to his brother in 1791 stating he was preoccupied with revolutionary affairs and would sooner die than cease to be a patriot. Upon his departure from the Constitutional Guard, he reported to the Committee of Surveillance of the Constitutional Assembly that the Guard was guilty of treason and that his lieutenant colonel, a man named Descours, had encouraged him to serve in the √©migr√© army of Louis Joseph, Prince of Cond√©, then stationed in Koblenz.Phipps, p. 147. This garnered for him the support of the Republicans, for Murat rejoined his former regiment and was promoted to corporal in April that year, and later to sergeant in May.Phipps, p. 147. By 19 November 1792, Murat was 25-years-old and elated at his latest promotion. As a sous-lieutenant, he thought, his family must recognize that he had no great propensity for the priesthood, and he was hoping to prove that he had not been wrong in wishing to be a soldier. One of the ministers had accused him of being an aristocrat, confusing him with the noble family of Murat d'Auvergne, an accusation that continued to haunt him for the next several years.Phipps, pp. 148‚Äì49. =13 Vend√©miaire= In the autumn of 1795, three years after King Louis XVI of France was deposed, royalists and counter- revolutionaries organised an armed uprising. On 3 October, General Napoleon Bonaparte, who was stationed in Paris, was named commander of the French National Convention's defending forces. This constitutional convention, after a long period of emergency rule, was striving to establish a more stable and permanent government in the uncertain period following the Reign of Terror. Bonaparte tasked Murat with the gathering of artillery from a suburb outside the control of the government's forces. Murat managed to take the cannons of the Camp des Sablons and transport them to the centre of Paris while avoiding the rioters. The use of these cannons ‚Äì the famous \\"whiff of grapeshot\\" ‚Äì on 5 October allowed Bonaparte to save the members of the National Convention.Connelly, pp. 20‚Äì21. For this success, Murat was made chef de brigade (colonel) and thereafter remained one of Napoleon's best officers. =Italian and Egyptian campaigns= Battle of Abukir, where 4,000 Ottoman soldiers drowned in the Nile In 1796, with the situation in the capital and government apparently stabilised and the war going poorly (See also: French Revolutionary Wars), Bonaparte lobbied to join the armies attempting to secure the revolution against the invading monarchist forces. Murat then went with Bonaparte to northern Italy, initially as his aide-de-camp, and was later named commander of the cavalry during the many campaigns against the Austrians and their allies. These forces were waging war on France and seeking to restore the Bourbon monarchy. Murat's valour and daring cavalry charges later earned him the rank of general in these important campaigns, the battles of which became famous as Bonaparte constantly used speed of maneuver to fend off and eventually defeat individually superior opposing armies closing in on the French forces from several directions. Thus, Murat's skills in no small part helped establish Bonaparte's legendary fame and enhance his popularity with the French people. Murat commanded the cavalry of the French Egyptian expedition of 1798, again under Bonaparte. In 1799, some remaining staff officers, including Murat, and Bonaparte returned to France, eluding various British fleets in five frigates. A short while later, Murat played an important, even pivotal, role in Bonaparte's \\"coup within a coup\\" of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799), when he first assumed political power. Along with two others (including Director Abb√© Siey√®s), Bonaparte set aside the five-man directory government, establishing the three-man French Consulate. Marriage certificate of Murat and Caroline Bonaparte, Archives nationales Murat married Caroline Bonaparte in a civil ceremony on 20 January 1800 at Mortefontaine and religious one on 4 January 1802 in Paris, thus becoming a son-in-law of Letizia Ramolino as well as brother-in-law to Napoleon Bonaparte, Joseph Bonaparte, Lucien Bonaparte, Elisa Bonaparte, Louis Bonaparte, Pauline Bonaparte, and J√©r√¥me Bonaparte. Napoleonic Wars Battle of Jena, 14 October 1806 Napoleon made Murat a Marshal of the Empire on 18 May 1804, and also granted him the title of \\"First Horseman of Europe\\". He was made Prince of the Empire and Admiral of the Empire in 1805 despite having very little knowledge about naval warfare. After several territorial concessions made by Prussia the Grand Duchy of Berg was setup, where as he was appointed Grand Duke of Berg and Duke of Cleves on 15 March 1806 and held this title until 1 August 1808, when he was named King of Naples. However his transition would not be a easy one seeing as Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon‚Äôs brother and previous king took many of the able bodied soldiers and administrators with him. Murat was in charge of the French Army in Madrid when the popular Dos de Mayo Uprising that started the Peninsular War broke out. Murat proved to be equally useful in the Russian campaign of 1812, where he distinguished himself as the best cavalry commander of the Grande Armee at battles such as Smolensk and Borodino, and expertly helped in commanding the retreat. He continued to serve Napoleon during the German Campaign of 1813. However, following Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Leipzig, Murat reached a secret agreement with the Allies in order to save his own throne, raising 30,000 troops and switching sides to the Coalition, Napoleon was so shocked he refused to believe his best and most trusted cavalry commander would turn on him, blaming it on his sister Caroline who was Queen of Naples. During the Hundred Days, he soon realized that the European powers, meeting at the Congress of Vienna, intended to remove him and return the Kingdom of Naples to its pre-Napoleonic rulers. Murat deserted his new allies before the War of the Seventh Coalition and, after issuing a proclamation to Italian patriots in Rimini, moved north to fight against the Austrians in the Neapolitan War in order to strengthen his rule in Italy by military means. However, he was defeated by Austrian general Frederick Bianchi at the Battle of Tolentino (2‚Äì3 May 1815). Death Murat fled to Corsica after Napoleon's fall. He attempted to rejoin Napoleon and take up his post as commander of the Cavalry again, but doubting his loyalty Napoleon refused. So, with his around a thousand followers, he hoped to regain control of Naples by fomenting an insurrection in Calabria, a decision he would later regret when his former allies, whom he had deserted, campaigned for his arrest in Calabria. Arriving at the port of Pizzo with 200 men, Murat attempted to rally support in the town square, but his plan turned awry. The crowd was hostile and he was attacked by an old woman blaming him for the loss of her son. Soon he was captured by forces of King Ferdinand IV of Naples. He was imprisoned in the Castello di Pizzo, a massive structure initially built as a fortress to fight off pirates, in the harbor of Pizzo, from where he wrote several letters, especially to his family. He was tried for treason and sentenced to death by firing squad. On 13 October, King Ferdinand, under the advice of the British ambassador to Naples, William √† Court, issued a decree by which \\"the condemned shall be granted not more than half an hour for the reception of religious aid.\\" > When the fatal moment arrived, Murat walked with a firm step to the place of > execution, as calm, as unmoved, as if he had been going to an ordinary > review.

He was one of the most influential figures in the development of jazz piano and, according to one source, \\"one of a small number of pianists whose playing shaped the history of jazz\\". The trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie (a member of Hines's big band, along with Charlie Parker) wrote, \\"The piano is the basis of modern harmony. This little guy came out of Chicago, Earl Hines. He changed the style of the piano. You can find the roots of Bud Powell, Herbie Hancock, all the guys who came after that. If it hadn't been for Earl Hines blazing the path for the next generation to come, it's no telling where or how they would be playing now. There were individual variations but the style of ... the modern piano came from Earl Hines.\\". The pianist Lennie Tristano said, \\"Earl Hines is the only one of us capable of creating real jazz and real swing when playing all alone.\\" Horace Silver said, \\"He has a completely unique style. No one can get that sound, no other pianist\\".Pittsburgh Music History. See External Links below.

Biography =Early life= Earl Hines was born in Duquesne, Pennsylvania, 12 miles from the center of Pittsburgh, in 1903. His father, Joseph Hines, played cornet and was the leader of the Eureka Brass Band in Pittsburgh,. and his stepmother was a church organist.. Hines said he \\"had a problem reaching the pedals\\". Hines intended to follow his father on cornet, but \\"blowing\\" hurt him behind the ears, whereas the piano did not.. The young Hines took lessons in playing classical piano.. Hines took lessons in classical piano from a Mr. Von Holz. By the age of eleven he was playing the organ in his Baptist church.. He had a \\"good ear and a good memory\\" and could replay songs after hearing them in theaters and park concerts:. \\"I'd be playing songs from these shows months before the song copies came out. That astonished a lot of people and they'd ask where I heard these numbers and I'd tell them at the theatre where my parents had taken me.\\" Later, Hines said that he was playing piano around Pittsburgh \\"before the word 'jazz' was even invented\\". =Early career= With his father's approval, Hines left home at the age of 17 to take a job playing piano with Lois Deppe and His Symphonian Serenaders in the Liederhaus, a Pittsburgh nightclub. He got his board, two meals a day,. \\"I remember that I really went for their apple dumplings\\". and $15 a week... Deppe, a well-known baritone concert artist who sang both classical and popular songs, also used the young Hines as his concert accompanist and took him on his concert trips to New York. In 1921 Hines and Deppe became the first African Americans to perform on radio.\\"The broadcast was played over a loud speaker on Wylie Avenue and crowds mobbed the street to listen and then stayed to cheer Deppe and Hines when they made it back to the Hill\\". Pittsburg Music History (see External Links, below). Hines's first recordings were accompanying Deppe ‚Äì four sides recorded for Gennett Records in 1923, still in the very early days of sound recording.. Only two of these were issued, one of which was a Hines composition, \\"Congaine\\", \\"a keen snappy foxtrot\\",Advertisement for Starr Phonography Company. November 10, 1923. which also featured a solo by Hines. He entered the studio again with Deppe a month later to record spirituals and popular songs, including \\"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\\" and \\"For the Last Time Call Me Sweetheart\\". He also accompanied Ethel Waters, describing his strategy as playing \\"under what the artist is doing\\" by listening \\"to the changes she made.\\" In 1925, after much family debate, Hines moved to Chicago, Illinois, then the world's jazz capital, the home of Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver. Hines started in Elite No. 2 Club but soon joined Carroll Dickerson's band, with whom he also toured on the Pantages Theatre Circuit to Los Angeles and back. Hines met Louis Armstrong in the poolroom of the Black Musicians' Union, local 208, on State and 39th in Chicago. Hines was 21, Armstrong 24. They played the union's piano together.. Armstrong was astounded by Hines's avant-garde \\"trumpet-style\\" piano playing, often using dazzlingly fast octaves so that on none-too-perfect upright pianos (and with no amplification) \\"they could hear me out front\\". Richard Cook wrote in Jazz Encyclopedia that Armstrong and Hines became good friends and shared a car. Armstrong joined Hines in Carroll Dickerson's band at the Sunset Cafe. In 1927, this became Armstrong's band under the musical direction of Hines.. Later that year, Armstrong revamped his Okeh Records recording-only band, Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five, and hired Hines as the pianist, replacing his wife, Lil Hardin Armstrong, on the instrument. Armstrong and Hines then recorded what are often regarded as some of the most important jazz records ever made. The Sunset Cafe closed in 1927. Hines, Armstrong and the drummer Zutty Singleton agreed that they would become the \\"Unholy Three\\" ‚Äì they would \\"stick together and not play for anyone unless the three of us were hired\\".. But as Louis Armstrong and His Stompers (with Hines as musical director), they ran into difficulties trying to establish their own venue, the Warwick Hall Club, which they rented for a year with the management help of Lil Hardin Armstrong. Hines went briefly to New York and returned to find that Armstrong and Singleton had rejoined the rival Dickerson band at the new Savoy Ballroom in his absence, leaving Hines feeling \\"warm\\". When Armstrong and Singleton later asked him to join them with Dickerson at the Savoy Ballroom, Hines said, \\"No, you guys left me in the rain and broke the little corporation we had\\".. Hines joined the clarinetist Jimmie Noone at the Apex, an after-hours speakeasy, playing from midnight to 6 a.m., seven nights a week. In 1928, he recorded 14 sides with Noone and again with Armstrong (for a total of 38 sides with Armstrong). His first piano solos were recorded late that year: eight for QRS Records in New York and then seven for Okeh Records in Chicago, all except two his own compositions. Hines moved in with Kathryn Perry (with whom he had recorded \\"Sadie Green the Vamp of New Orleans\\"). Hines said of her, \\"She'd been at The Sunset too, in a dance act. She was a very charming, pretty girl. She had a good voice and played the violin. I had been divorced and she became my common-law wife. We lived in a big apartment and her parents stayed with us\\".. Perry recorded several times with Hines, including \\"Body & Soul\\" in 1935. They stayed together until 1940, when Hines \\"divorced\\" her to marry Ann Jones Reed, but that marriage was soon \\"indefinitely postponed\\".. Hines married singer 'Lady of Song' Janie Moses in 1947. They had two daughters, Janear (born 1950) and Tosca. Both daughters died before he did, Tosca in 1976 and Janear in 1981. Janie divorced him on June 14, 1979. =Chicago years= On December 28, 1928 (his 25th birthday and six weeks before the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre), the always-immaculate Hines opened at Chicago's Grand Terrace Cafe leading his own big band, the pinnacle of jazz ambition at the time. \\"All America was dancing\\", Hines said, and for the next 12 years and through the worst of the Great Depression and Prohibition, Hines's band was the orchestra at the Grand Terrace. The Hines Orchestra ‚Äì or \\"Organization\\", as Hines preferred it ‚Äì had up to 28 musicians and did three shows a night at the Grand Terrace, four shows every Saturday and sometimes Sundays. According to Stanley Dance, \\"Earl Hines and The Grand Terrace were to Chicago what Duke Ellington and The Cotton Club were to New York ‚Äì but fierier.\\"Dance, Stanley. Sleeve note to Earl Hines: South Side Swing 1934/5. The Grand Terrace was controlled by the gangster Al Capone, so Hines became Capone's \\"Mr Piano Man\\". The Grand Terrace upright piano was soon replaced by a white $3,000 Bechstein grand.. Talking about those days Hines later said: From the Grand Terrace, Hines and his band broadcast on \\"open mikes\\" over many years, sometimes seven nights a week, coast-to-coast across America ‚Äì Chicago being well placed to deal with live broadcasting across time zones in the United States. The Hines band became the most broadcast band in America.. Among the listeners were a young Nat King Cole. \\"Every kid pianist in the Midwest copied Earl Hines. Little Nat Cole learned to play jazz piano by listening to Gatemouth [Hines] on the radio. And when the radio blew a tube the boy would sneak out of his apartment on Prairie Avenue, run several blocks through the dark, and stand outside the Grand Terrace nightclub, under the elevated train, and listen to Earl's piano live from there. It inspired him to precocious mastery of jazz.\\" and Jay McShann in Kansas City, who said his \\"real education came from Earl Hines. When 'Fatha' went off the air, I went to bed.\\" Hines's most significant \\"student\\" was Art Tatum.. According to the pianist Teddy Wilson and the saxophonist Eddie Barefield, \\"Art Tatum's favorite jazz piano player was Earl Hines. He [Tatum] used to buy all of Earl's records and would improvise on them. He'd play the record but he'd improvise over what Earl was doing ... course, when you heard Art play you didn't hear nothing of anybody but Art. But he got his ideas from Earl's style of playing ‚Äì but Earl never knew that\\". The Hines band usually comprised 15-20 musicians on stage, occasionally up to 28. Among the band's many members were Wallace Bishop, Alvin Burroughs, Scoops Carry, Oliver Coleman, Bob Crowder, Thomas Crump, George Dixon, Julian Draper, Streamline Ewing, Ed Fant, Milton Fletcher, Walter Fuller, Dizzy Gillespie, Leroy Harris, Woogy Harris, Darnell Howard, Cecil Irwin, Harry 'Pee Wee' Jackson, Warren Jefferson, Budd Johnson, Jimmy Mundy, Ray Nance, Charlie Parker, Willie Randall, Omer Simeon, Cliff Smalls, Leon Washington, Freddie Webster, Quinn Wilson and Trummy Young. Occasionally, Hines allowed another pianist sit in for him, the better to allow him to conduct the whole \\"Organization\\". Jess StacyAllen, Steve. \\"The Return of Jess Stacy.\\". Unidentified newspaper, undated. Jess Stacy Collection, Southeast Missouri State University Special Collections and Archives. was one, Nat \\"King\\" Cole and Teddy Wilson were others, but Cliff Smalls was his favorite., inc. photos. Each summer, Hines toured with his whole band for three months, including through the South ‚Äì the first black big band to do so. He explained, \\"[when] we traveled by train through the South, they would send a porter back to our car to let us know when the dining room was cleared, and then we would all go in together. We couldn't eat when we wanted to. We had to eat when they were ready for us.\\" In Duke Ellington's America, Harvey G Cohen writes: =The birth of bebop= Hines in 1947 (photograph by William P. Gottlieb) In 1942 Hines provided the saxophonist Charlie Parker with his big break, until Parker was fired for his \\"time- keeping\\" ‚Äì by which Hines meant his inability to show up on time, despite Parker's resorting to sleeping under the band stage in his attempts to be punctual.. Dizzie Gillespie joined the same year. The Grand Terrace Cafe had closed suddenly in December 1940; its manager, the cigar-puffing Ed Fox, disappeared. The 37-year-old Hines, always famously good to work for,. For instance, according to Ray Nance, \\"Earl was wonderful to work for\\" (p. 136); according to Willie Cook, \\"Earl used psychology. He had everybody loving that band\\" (p. 179). took his band on the road full-time for the next eight years, resisting renewed offers from Benny Goodman to join his band as piano player. Several members of Hines's band were drafted into the armed forces in World War II ‚Äì a major problem.\\"Father Hines Loses Plenty of Children\\". Variety, August 18, 1943. Six were drafted in 1943 alone. As a result, on August 19, 1943, Hines had to cancel the rest of his Southern tour.. He went to New York and hired a \\"draft-proof\\" 12-piece all-woman group, which lasted two months.. Next, Hines expanded it into a 28-piece band (17 men, 11 women), including strings and French horn. Despite these wartime difficulties, Hines took his bands on tour from coast to coastSee for detailed chronology. but was still able to take time out from his own band to front the Duke Ellington Orchestra in 1944 when Ellington fell ill. It was during this time (and especially during the recording ban during the 1942‚Äì44 musicians' strike ) that late- night jam sessions with members of Hines's band's sowed the seeds for the emerging new style in jazz, bebop. Ellington later said that \\"the seeds of bop were in Earl Hines's piano style\\".. \\"Ellington had a way of saying serious things about music casually but ... then I realized [Ellington] had in mind the revolution Hines effected in the function of the jazz pianist's left hand\\". Charlie Parker's biographer Ross Russell wrote: As early as 1940, saxophone player and arranger Budd Johnson had \\"re-written the book\\" for the Hines' band in a more modern style. Johnson and Billy Eckstine, Hines vocalist between 1939 and 1943, have been credited with helping to bring modern players into the Hines band in the transition between swing and bebop. Apart from Parker and Gillespie, other Hines 'modernists' included Gene Ammons, Gail Brockman, Scoops Carry, Goon Gardner, Wardell Gray, Bennie Green, Benny Harris, Harry 'Pee-Wee' Jackson, Shorty McConnell, Cliff Smalls, Shadow Wilson and Sarah Vaughan, who replaced Eckstine as the band singer in 1943 and stayed for a year. Dizzy Gillespie said of the music the band evolved: The links to bebop remained close. Parker's discographer, among others,See also . has argued that \\"Yardbird Suite\\", which Parker recorded with Miles Davis in March 1946, was in fact based on Hines' \\"Rosetta\\", which nightly served as the Hines band theme-tune.Komara, Parker's discographer, says, \\"Track 2 Yardbird Suite (Charlie Parker): 32 measures AABA chorus, based on the chords of \\"Rosetta\\" (Earl Hines): key of C 4/4 meter\\" with a further page [p. 67] of detail. \\"The piece dates back to Parker's tenure with Jay McShann in 1940-1942 when it was known as \\"What Price Love\\" as well as \\"Yardbird Suite\\". The harmonic model is \\"Rosetta\\" composed by Earl Hines and Henri Woode. Of the four takes waxed by Parker for Dial, only the first and last survive\\". (Komara 1998, 122). Reissued as 'Charlie Parker on Dial': Spotlite SPJ-CD 4-101:The Complete Sessions CD 1993 [also on LP 1970, Spotlite LP101 Vol I] Dizzy Gillespie described the Hines band, saying, \\"We had a beautiful, beautiful band with Earl Hines. He's a master and you learn a lot from him, self-discipline and organization.\\". In July 1946, Hines suffered serious head injuries in a car crash near Houston which, despite an operation, affected his eyesight for the rest of his life.. Back on the road again four months later, he continued to lead his big band for two more years.[ \\"Earl Hines biography.\\"] allmusic.com In 1947, Hines bought the biggest nightclub in Chicago, The El Grotto,. but it soon foundered with Hines losing $30,000 ($ today).. The big-band era was over ‚Äì Hines' bands had been at the top for 20 years. =Rediscovery= From left: Jack Teagarden, Sandy DeSantis, Velma Middleton, Fraser MacPherson, Cozy Cole, Arvell Shaw, Earl Hines, Barney Bigard at the Palomar Supper Club, Vancouver, B.C., March 17, 1951 In early 1948, Hines joined up again with Armstrong in the \\"Louis Armstrong and His All-Stars\\" \\"small-band\\". It was not without its strains for Hines. A year later, Armstrong became the first jazz musician to appear on the cover of Time magazine (on February 21, 1949). Armstrong was by then on his way to becoming an American icon, leaving Hines to feel he was being used only as a sideman in comparison to his old friend. Armstrong said of the difficulties, mainly over billing, \\"Hines and his ego, ego, ego ...\\", but after three years and to Armstrong's annoyance,. Hines left the All Stars in 1951. Next, back as leader again, Hines took his own small combos around the United States. He started with a markedly more modern lineup than the aging All Stars: Bennie Green, Art Blakey, Tommy Potter, and Etta Jones. In 1954, he toured his then seven-piece group nationwide with the Harlem Globetrotters. In 1958 he broadcast on the American Forces Network but by the start of the jazz-lean 1960s and old enough to retire,Dance, Stanley. Liner notes. Earl Hines at Home. Delmark DD 212. Hines settled \\"home\\" in Oakland, California, with his wife and two young daughters, opened a tobacconist's, and came close to giving up the profession. Then, in 1964, thanks to Stanley Dance, his determined friend and unofficial manager, Hines was \\"suddenly rediscovered\\" following a series of recitals at the Little Theatre in New York, which Dance had cajoled him into. They were the first piano recitals Hines had ever given; they caused a sensation. \\"What is there left to hear after you've heard Earl Hines?\\", asked John Wilson of The New York Times.Wilson, John S. New York Times, March 14, 1964. Hines then won the 1966 International Critics Poll for Down Beat magazine's Hall of Fame. Down Beat also elected him the world's \\"No. 1 Jazz Pianist\\" in 1966 (and did so again five more times). Jazz Journal awarded his LPs of the year first and second in its overall poll and first, second and third in its piano category.Spontaneous Improvisations and The Grand Terrace Band in the overall poll; Spontaneous Improvisations, The Real Earl Hines and Fatha in the piano category. Jazz voted him \\"Jazzman of the Year\\" and picked him for its number 1 and number 2 places in the category Piano Recordings. Hines was invited to appear on TV shows hosted by Johnny Carson and Mike Douglas. From then until his death twenty years later, Hines recorded endlessly, both solo and with contemporaries like Cat Anderson, Harold Ashby, Barney Bigard, Lawrence Brown, Dave Brubeck (they recorded duets in 1975), Jaki Byard (duets in 1972), Benny Carter, Buck Clayton, Cozy Cole, Wallace Davenport, Eddie \\"Lockjaw\\" Davis, Vic Dickenson, Roy Eldridge, Duke Ellington (duets in 1966), Ella Fitzgerald, Panama Francis, Bud Freeman, Stan Getz, Dizzy Gillespie, Paul Gonsalves, Stephane Grappelli, Sonny Greer, Lionel Hampton, Coleman Hawkins, Milt Hinton, Johnny Hodges, Peanuts Hucko, Helen Humes, Budd Johnson, Jonah Jones, Max Kaminsky, Gene Krupa, Ellis Larkins, Shelly Manne, Marian McPartland (duets in 1970), Gerry Mulligan, Ray Nance, Oscar Peterson (duets in 1968), Russell Procope, Pee Wee Russell, Jimmy Rushing, Stuff Smith, Rex Stewart, Maxine Sullivan, Buddy Tate, Jack Teagarden, Clark Terry, Sarah Vaughan, Joe Venuti, Earle Warren, Ben Webster, Teddy Wilson (duets in 1965 and 1970), Jimmy Witherspoon, Jimmy Woode and Lester Young. Possibly more surprising were Alvin Batiste, Tony Bennett, Art Blakey, Teresa Brewer, Barbara Dane, Richard Davis, Elvin Jones, Etta Jones, the Ink Spots, Peggy Lee, Helen Merrill, Charles Mingus, Oscar Pettiford, Vi Redd, Betty Roch√©, Caterina Valente, Dinah Washington, and Ry Cooder (on the song \\"Ditty Wah Ditty\\"). But the most highly regarded recordings of this period are his solo performances, \\"a whole orchestra by himself\\".Clarke, Donald (1989, 2005). Hines, Earl. MusicWeb Encyclopedia of Popular Music. Retrieved August 1, 2006. Whitney Balliett wrote of his solo recordings and performances of this time: Solo tributes to Armstrong, Hoagy Carmichael, Ellington, George Gershwin and Cole Porter were all put on record in the 1970s, sometimes on the 1904 12-legged Steinway given to him in 1969 by Scott Newhall, the managing editor of the San Francisco Chronicle. In 1974, when he was in his seventies, Hines recorded sixteen LPs. \\"A spate of solo recording meant that, in his old age, Hines was being comprehensively documented at last, and he rose to the challenge with consistent inspirational force\\".. From his 1964 \\"comeback\\" until his death, Hines recorded over 100 LPs all over the world. Within the industry, he became legendary for going into a studio and coming out an hour and a half later having recorded an unplanned solo LP.See, for instance, the producer George Avakian's sleeve notes to Columbia's 1951 solo album Piano Moods CL6171 and producer Hank O'Neal's sleeve notes to the 1977 solo album Earl Hines in New Orleans, Chiaroscuro CR(D) 200. Retakes were almost unheard of except when Hines wanted to try a tune again in some other way, often completely different.. A typical example of this is the three alternative and dramatically different versions of \\"Rose Room\\" that Hines recorded over less than half an hour in Paris in 1965 (all three are on the album Fatha's Hands). From 1964 on, Hines often toured Europe, especially France. He toured South America in 1968. He performed in Asia, Australia, Japan and, in 1966, the Soviet Union, in tours funded by the U.S. State Department. During his six- week tour of the Soviet Union, in which he performed 35 concerts,. the 10,000-seat Kyiv Sports Palace was sold out. As a result, the Kremlin cancelled his Moscow and Leningrad concerts as being \\"too culturally dangerous\\".Time, August 16, 1966. =Final years= Arguably still playing as well as he ever had, Hines displayed individualistic quirks (including grunts) in these performances. He sometimes sang as he played, especially his own \\"They Didn't Believe I Could Do It ... Neither Did I\\". In 1975, Hines was the subject of an hour-long television documentary film made by ATV (for Britain's commercial ITV channel), out-of-hours at the Blues Alley nightclub in Washington, DC. The International Herald Tribune described it as \\"the greatest jazz film ever made\\". In the film, Hines said, \\"The way I like to play is that ... I'm an explorer, if I might use that expression, I'm looking for something all the time ... almost like I'm trying to talk.\\" In 1979, Hines was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame. He played solo at Duke Ellington's funeral, played solo twice at the White House, for the President of France and for the Pope. Of this acclaim, Hines said, \\"Usually they give people credit when they're dead. I got my flowers while I was living\\".Milwaukee Journal, April 22, 1983. Hines's last show took place in San Francisco a few days before he died of a heart attack in Oakland. As he had wished, his Steinway was auctioned for the benefit of gifted low-income music students, still bearing its silver plaque: :presented by jazz lovers from all over the world. this piano is the only one of its kind in the world and expresses the great genius of a man who has never played a melancholy note in his lifetime on a planet that has often succumbed to despair.. Hines was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland, California. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Earl Hines among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Style The Oxford Companion to Jazz describes Hines as \\"the most important pianist in the transition from stride to swing\\" and continues: Hines himself described meeting Armstrong: Hines continued: In their book Jazz (2009), Gary Giddins and Scott DeVeaux wrote of Hines's style of the time: In his book Louis Armstrong: Master of Modernism, Thomas Brothers described Hines' style: > Rhythmically, Hines was very good at taking his melodic lines further and > further way from the fixed foundation, creating a radical sense of > detachment for a few beats or measures, only to land back in time with great > aplomb when finished with his foray. The left hand sometimes joins in the > action...What is especially distinctive about Hines are the startling > effects he creates by harmonically enhancing these rhythmic departures. Like > Armstrong, he thought of chords creatively and with great precision. But he > was a step ahead of his colleague in his willingness to experiment. He > became fond of radical dislocations, sudden turns of directions with dim and > nonexistent connection to the ground harmony. Pianist Teddy Wilson wrote of Hines's style: Oliver Jackson was Hines's frequent drummer (as well as a drummer for Oscar Peterson, Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington, Teddy Wilson and many others Of Hines's later style, The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz says of Hines' 1965 style: Later still, then in his seventies and after a host of recent solo recordings, Hines himself said: Discography * Earl Hines (Columbia, 1951) * Fats Waller Songs (Brunswick, 1952) * Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five with Earl Hines (Odeon, 1954) * Fatha Plays Fats (Fantasy, 1956) * Solo (America, 1956) * Oh, \\"Father\\"!

Most plants are confined to the numerous cracks in the limestone. An alvar is a biological environment based on a limestone plain with thin or no soil and, as a result, sparse grassland vegetation. Often flooded in the spring, and affected by drought in midsummer, alvar support a distinctive group of prairie-like plants. Most alvars occur either in northern Europe or around the Great Lakes in North America. This stressed habitat supports a community of rare plants and animals, including species more commonly found on prairie grasslands. Lichen and mosses are common species. Trees and bushes are absent or severely stunted. The primary cause of alvars is the shallow exposed bedrock. Flooding and drought, as noted, add to the stress of the site and prevent many species from growing. Disturbance may also play a role. In Europe, grazing is frequent, while in North America, there is some evidence that fire may also prevent encroachment by forest. The habitat also has strong competition gradients, with better competitors occupying the deeper soil and excluding other species to less productive locations. Crevices in the limestone provide a distinctive habitat which is somewhat protected from grazing, and which may provide habitat for unusual ferns such as Pellaea atropurpurea. Bare rock flats provide areas with extremely low competition that serve as refugia for weak competitors such as Minuartia michauxii and Micranthes virginiensis. In a representative set of four Ontario alvars, seven habitat types were described. From deep to shallow soil these were: tall grassy meadows, tall forb-rich meadows, low grassy meadows, low forb-rich meadows, dry grassland, rock margin grassland and bare rock flats. Alvars comprise a small percentage of the Earth's ecosystems by land extent. Although some 120 exist in the Great Lakes region, in total there are only about left across the entire Great Lakes basin, and many of these have been degraded by agriculture and other human uses. More than half of all remaining alvars occur in Ontario. There are smaller areas in New York, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Quebec. In North America, alvars provide habitat for birds such as bobolinks, eastern meadowlarks, upland sandpipers, eastern towhees, brown thrashers and loggerhead shrikes whose habitat is declining elsewhere. Rare plants include Kalm's lobelia (Lobelia kalmii), Pringle's aster (Symphyotrichum pilosum var. pringlei), juniper sedge (Carex juniperorum), lakeside daisy (Hymenoxys acaulis), ram's-head lady's-slipper (Cypripedium arietinum), and dwarf lake iris (Iris lacustris). Also associated with alvars are rare butterflies and snails. The use of the word \\"alvar\\" to refer to this type of environment originated in Sweden. The largest alvar in Europe is located on the Swedish island of √ñland. Here the thin soil mantle is only 0.5 to 2.0 centimeters thick in most places and in many extents consists of exposed limestone slabs. The landscape there has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are other more local names for similar landforms, such as a pavement barren, although this term is also used for similar landforms based on sandstone. In the United Kingdom the exposed landform is called a limestone pavement and thinly covered limestone is known as calcareous grassland.

Estonia used to be home to approximately one third of the world's alvars; however, the total area of alvars has decreased from 43,000 hectares in the 1930s to 12,000 hectares in 2000, and approximately 9,000 hectares in 2010. Estonian alvars are home to 267 species of vascular plants, approximately one fifth of which are protected. There are also 142 species of bryophytes and 263 species of lichens. The Estonian government has committed itself to protect at least 9,800 hectares of the country's alvars as part of the Natura 2000 network.

Zilpah gave birth to two sons, whom Leah claimed as her own and named Gad and Asher (). Zilpah is given to Leah as a handmaid by Leah's father, Laban, upon Leah's marriage to Jacob (see , ). According to the early rabbinical commentary Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, Zilpah and Bilhah, the handmaids of Leah and Rachel, respectively, were actually younger daughters of Laban. Zilpah also figures in the competition between Jacob's wives to bear him sons. Leah stops conceiving after the birth of her fourth son, at which point Rachel, who had not yet borne children, offers her handmaid, Bilhah, \\"to wife\\" to Jacob so that she can have children through her. When Bilhah conceives two sons, Leah takes up the same idea and presents Zilpah \\"to wife\\" to Jacob. Leah names the two sons of Zilpah and is directly involved in their upbringing. According to Rashi, an 11th-century commentator, Zilpah was younger than Bilhah, and Laban's decision to give her to Leah was part of the deception he used to trick Jacob into marrying Leah, who was older than Rachel. The morning after the wedding, Laban explained to Jacob, \\"This is not done in our place, to give the younger before the older\\" (). But at night, to mask the deception, Laban gave the veiled bride the younger of the handmaids, so Jacob would think that he was really marrying Rachel, the younger of the sisters.For Rashi's commentary on this, with English translation, see Rashi's notes on 30:10: In Jewish tradition, Zilpah is believed to be buried in the Tomb of the Matriarchs in Tiberias. Family tree In popular culture In the novel The Red Tent by Anita Diamant, Zilpah and Bilhah are represented as half-sisters of Leah and Rachel by different mothers.

Trejo is perhaps most recognized as the character Machete, originally developed by Rodriguez for the Spy Kids series of movies and later expanded into Trejo's own series of films aimed at a more adult audience. He has appeared in TV shows such as Breaking Bad, Brooklyn Nine- Nine, The X-Files, King of the Hill, The Flash, and Sons of Anarchy.

Throughout the '60s, Trejo was in and out of jail and prison in California; Trejo has suggested that his physical appearance contributed to his constantly getting into trouble. There are conflicting accounts of his prison chronology. By one account, his final term in custody ended in 1972; by another account, he did time in a juvenile offenders' camp and six California prisons between 1959 and 1969. He recalled that his last prison term was five years. While serving in San Quentin, he became a champion boxer in that prison's lightweight and welterweight divisions. During this time, Trejo became a member of a 12-step program, which he credits with his success in overcoming drug addiction. In 2011, he recalled that he had been sober for 42 years. Career =Film and television= While Trejo was working as a youth drug counselor, a teenage patient asked for his assistance dealing with cocaine problems on the set of Runaway Train (1985). While there, Trejo was offered a job as an extra in the film's prison scenes. Edward Bunker, himself an individual who was formerly incarcerated and at the time a well-respected crime author who was writing the screenplay for the film, recognized Trejo, with whom he had done time at San Quentin. Bunker, remembering Trejo's boxing skills, offered him $320 per day to train Eric Roberts, one of the movie's stars, for a boxing scene. Director Andrei Konchalovsky liked Trejo's work and decided to offer him a small role in the film as a boxer. It has been widely misreported that Trejo was actually serving time in the prison during filming, when in fact he had been released more than a decade earlier. Trejo at Muscle Beach Since then, Trejo has become a prolific actor in both films and television, appearing in five or more movies per year, in various genres. He has appeared in such major releases as Marked for Death (1990), Blood In Blood Out (1993), Desperado (1995), Heat (1995), From Dusk till Dawn (1996), Anaconda (1997), Con Air (1997), The Replacement Killers (1998), Six Days, Seven Nights (1998), Animal Factory (2000), Bubble Boy (2001), Spy Kids (2001), XXX (2002), Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003), Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004), The Devil's Rejects (2005), Snoop Dogg's Hood of Horror (2006), Delta Farce (2007), Grindhouse (2007), Rob Zombie's Halloween (2007), Urban Justice (2007, alongside Steven Seagal), Valley of Angels (2008), The Haunted World of El Superbeasto (2009, in which he voices the character of Rico), Modus Operandi (2010), Machete (2010), Predators (2010), A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas (2011), Bad Ass (2012), Reaper (2014), Preggoland (2014), and Range 15 (2016).

I'm still scared that somebody's going to wake me up and say, 'Hey, we're still in prison. Let's go to chow\\". Many of Trejo's characters in Robert Rodriguez movies have been named after knives or sharp instruments: Machete in Spy Kids, Razor Charlie in the From Dusk till Dawn series, Navajas (Spanish for folding knife) in Desperado, and Cuchillo (Spanish for knife) in Predators. He also played Machete in a trailer made for Rodriguez's film collaboration with Quentin Tarantino, Grindhouse.

History =Founding and organization= Yitzak Rabin [background] with Nachum Sarig at the right Negev Brigade parading prior to Operation Horev The brigade was founded in March 1948 with two battalions, the 2nd and 8th. The 7th Battalion was created in April, with the 9th Battalion being the last of the four. Yisrael Galili, the Haganah Chief of Staff, and Yigal Allon, the Palmach commander, chose Sarig to command the brigade in December 1947, although the residents of the Negev and David Ben-Gurion appointed Shaul Avigur instead, without Sarig's knowledge. After Avigur toured the Negev, he told Ben-Gurion that he would not be able to command the brigade, citing deteriorating health, and praised Sarig. It was commanded by Nahum \\"Sergei\\" Sarig (which is why it was also called Sergei Brigade) and consisted of four Palmach battalions. The Negev Brigade participated in many operations in the Negev Desert, including Operation Yoav in the latter part of the war. Sarig decided to divide the Negev into two sectors, divided by the Beersheba‚ÄìGaza road (later Highway 25). Yigal Allon then named Haim Bar-Lev as the commander of the southern sector‚Äîthe 8th Battalion. The Palmach memorial website records the names of 312 of its members who died whilst in the Negev Brigade. During the 1948 war the Negev Brigade was involved in the defence of Negba, Kafr Daron, Be'erot Yitzhak and Nirim. In October 1948 the Brigade took part in the conquest of Beersheba. They were also part of Operations Barak, Yoav, An Far, Horev, Uvda and Pleshet. In the 1967 war the Brigade fought in the battle of Abu Agelia.

Barber \\"A Brief History of the IBFI\\" History The founding of the IBFI resulted from a controversy involving Arlington Baptist College of Arlington, Texas, an affiliate of the World Baptist Fellowship (WBF) after Raymond W. Barber, then President of the WBF, lost a lawsuit against the college.Earl K. Oldham, \\"USS WBF Sail On\\" The lawsuit was an attempt to force the Arlington Baptist College to recognize its parent/child relationship to the WBF, revert to its original name, Bible Baptist Seminary, and return to the original intent of its founders, J. Frank Norris and Louis Entzminger. He claimed that by seeking accreditation, the Arlington Baptist College was straying from its original purpose of training preachers. Barber moved forward with the lawsuit even though an investigator found that the Bible Baptist Seminary Board of Directors had created a new junior college in conjunction with the seminary, the seminary was allowed to die and the Arlington Baptist Junior College became the Arlington Baptist College. Although it was not a major issue during the controversy, Barber charged the Arlington Baptist College with teaching the doctrines of grace, often called Calvinism, and said that some of its faculty members were \\"hyper\\" Calvinists.Earl K. Oldham, \\"USS WBF Sail On\\" It was a strategy that worked, bringing together a strong following who shared his concerns. Barber's actions resulted in his becoming a catalyst that drew 271 disenchanted pastors and missionaries together to create the new organization. IBFI was careful to incorporate all of its institutions into one unit. It created a Bible institute, Norris Bible Baptist Institute, a monthly publication, The Searchlight, and a mission agency, all of which were under one corporation and headed by a board of directors. It elected Raymond Barber, Randy Cotton, Arvie Jernigan, Bill Slayton and Jack Warren as its first board of directors.Raymond W. Barber \\"A Brief History of the IBFI\\" The early years were aggressive, drawing support from 327 churches for its school, publication and 21 missionary families.Raymond W. Barber \\"A Brief History of the IBFI\\" After a few years of tremendous momentum, the organization began to have internal squabbles. Barber was elected to the office of the president year after year without any challenge whatsoever. Finally, someone stood up in a meeting and nominated another pastor to that office. In a ruse, fifteen minutes before his term expired, Barber resigned. Again, his strategy worked. He was reelected by a Landslide vote. But that incident proved to be a foreshadow of things to come. In \\"A View of the Norris Phenomenon\\",Jack Warren \\"A View of the Norris Phenomenon\\" the author points to the common problem of egocentricity among fundamentalist leaders as the cause of IBFI's decline. In less than seven years, Barber had badgered Jack Warren, editor of The Searchlight, and Young Houston, director of missions, into resigning. Most of the original pastors soon left IBFI for various reasons. A new group of ministers, who were mostly anti-organizational, came into the ranks. The Bible institute became a seminary, the mission agency was reduced to a clearing house and the by-laws were replaced by a document that disenfranchised the supporting churches. Financial problems began to plague the organization and enrollment in the seminary consistently lagged between 10 and 25 students. A deal was eventually made for Crown College in Knoxville, Tennessee, to take over the seminary. Critics blame the questionable funding of an expensive building on IBFI property, called the \\"Raymond Barber Conference Center\\", for the fellowship's ultimate failure.Albert W. Wardin, Jr. \\"Baptists Around the World\\" In its prime, Arlington Baptist College had a consistently expanding enrollment that was close to 1,000 students.Earl K. Oldham \\"USS WBF Sail On\\" Twenty-five years after the split, total enrollment for both schools was under 200 students annually.

There are variant forms of open marriage such as swinging and polyamory, each with the partners having varying levels of input on their spouse's activities. Terminology A general definition of an open marriage is that there is an agreement between the two partners to have some degree of sexual interaction outside the couple. There are variant forms of open marriage, each with the partners having varying levels of input on their spouse's activities. The term open marriage originated in sociology and anthropology. Through the 1960s, researchers used \\"closed marriage\\" to indicate the practices of communities and cultures where individuals were intended to marry based upon social conventions and proscriptions, and open marriage where individuals had the ability to make their own choice of spouse.Johnson, H.M. (1960). Sociology: A Systematic Introduction. New York, NY: Harcourt, Brace and World, Inc.Jacobsohn, P., & Matheny, A.P. (1963). Mate selection in open marriage systems. In K. Ishwaran and J.M. Mogey (Eds.), Family and Marriage (pp. 98-123). Leiden, The Netherlands: E.J. Brill, Publisher. Nena O'Neill and George O'Neill changed the meaning of the term with the 1972 publication of their book Open Marriage. The O'Neills describe open marriage as a relationship in which each partner has room for personal growth and can individually develop outside friendships, rather than focus obsessively on their couplehood and their family unit (being \\"closed\\"). Most of the book describes approaches to revitalizing marriage in areas of trust, role flexibility, communication, identity, and equality. Chapter 16, entitled \\"Love Without Jealousy\\", devoted 20 pages to the proposition that an open marriage might possibly include some forms of sexuality with other partners. Fueled by frequent appearances of the O'Neills on television and in magazine articles, the redefinition entered popular consciousness, and open marriage became a synonym for sexually non-monogamous marriage. In her 1977 book The Marriage Premise, Nena O'Neill advocated sexual fidelity in a chapter of that name. As she later said, \\"The whole area of extramarital sex is touchy. I don't think we ever saw it as a concept for the majority, and certainly it has not proved to be.\\" =Definitional issues= The meaning of open marriage can vary from study to study depending on how the particular researchers have set their selection criteria. Individuals might claim to have open marriages when their spouses would not agree. Studies and articles that interview individuals without taking their married status into account may not receive accurate information about the actual \\"open\\" status of the marriage. Blumstein and Schwartz asked more than 6,000 couples whether or not they had an understanding allowing sex outside their relationship. Interviewed individually, the partners in some couples gave very different responses to this question; the respective replies from one married couple were * \\"We've never spoken about cheating, but neither of us believe in it. I don't think I'd ever forgive him. I don't think I'd be able to. I don't know. I haven't met up with that situation.\\" (Blumstein & Schwartz, 1983, page 287) * \\"Sure we have an understanding. It's 'You do what you want. Never go back to the same one.' See, that's where it's going to screw your mind up, to go back the second time to the same person.\\" (Blumstein & Schwartz, 1983, page 286) Couples may have an open marriage in principle, but not engage in extramarital sex. Studies that define open marriage by agreement alone will tend to report a higher incidence than studies that define open marriage by agreement and behavior. Spaniel and Cole found that 7 percent of couples would consider participating in an open marriage, but only 1.7 percent of couples reported having open marriages that actually included extramarital sex.Spanier G.B., & Cole C.L. (1975). Mate swapping: Perceptions, value orientations, and participation in a midwestern community. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 4, 143‚Äì159. Blumstein and Schwartz found that 15 percent of married couples share an agreement that allows extramarital sex, but only about 24 percent of men and 22 percent of women (or 6 percent and 5 percent of the total, respectively) who had such an agreement actually engaged in extramarital sex during the prior year. Researchers have applied open marriage in overly narrow terms, as when Hunt used it specifically to mean swinging couples who meet with other swinging couples to swap mates.Hunt, M. (1974). Sexual Behavior in the 1970s. Chicago, IL: Playboy Press. Open marriage is usually defined in terms of legally married, opposite-sex partners, and thus data collected may not generalize to other kinds of open relationships. For example, cohabiting couples tend to show higher levels of involvement in extra-relational intimacy compared to married couples.Forste, R., & Tanfer, K. (1996). Sexual exclusivity among dating, cohabitating, and married women. Journal of Marriage and the Family, 58, 33‚Äì47.Treas, J., & Giesen, D. (2000). Sexual infidelity among married and cohabitating Americans. Journal of Marriage and the Family, 62, 48‚Äì60. Gay male couples show very high levels of open relationships compared to straight couples. There is a lack of content regarding studies and educational programming in open marriage and diverse relationship structures. Due to this, there is much uncertainty regarding the topic. Common misconceptions of nonmonogamy include that it violates principles of all religions, and that it is equivalent to polygyny (one man having multiple wives) or polygamy (a marriage of many). =Ideals of an open marriage= *Here-and-now living combined with realistic expectations: There is a reduction of commitment to and sacrifice in the long-term goals. *Personal privacy: A greater respect for personal privacy than in a traditional marriage. *Open and honest communication: sharing, self- disclosure, and productive fighting. *Role flexibility: open partners exhibit this considerably. *Open companionship: avoiding traditional marriage assumptions of coupledness. This may involve the development of deep personal, sexual relationships with other members outside their marriage. *Equality: equality of power as well as responsibility. *Pursuit of identity: An individual's uniqueness is valued, differences are not seen as a threat. *Mutual trust: an assumption that everything is out on the open and that one's partner is not a possession that is guarded. Relationship maintenance The impact of open marriage on relationships varies across couples. Some couples report high levels of marital satisfaction and have long-lasting open marriages. Other couples drop out of the open marriage lifestyle and return to sexual monogamy. These couples may continue to believe open marriage is a valid way of life, just not for them. The extent to which open marriage actually contributes to divorce remains uncertain. Blumstein and Schwartz note a slightly higher risk of divorce among couples who engage in extramarital sex, even if the couples agree to allow extramarital sex. However, Rubin and Adams did not observe any significant difference in the risk of divorce for couples in open marriages and couples in sexually monogamous marriages. =Jealousy issues= A 1981 study concluded that around 80 percent of people in open marriages experienced jealousy over their extramarital relationships.Buunk B. (1981). Jealousy in sexually open marriages. Alternative Lifestyles, 4, 357‚Äì372.Ramey J. W. (1975). Intimate groups and networks: Frequent consequences of sexually open marriage. Family Coordinator, 24, 515‚Äì530. Couples in open marriages experienced as much or more jealousy than people in sexually monogamous marriages.Trost, M. R., Brown, S., & Morrison, M. (1994). Jealousy as an adaptive communication strategy. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Speech Communication Association, New Orleans, LA.Pines, A., & Aronson, E. (1983). Antecedents, correlates, and consequences, of sexual jealousy. Journal of Personality, 51, 108‚Äì136.Rubin A. M., & Adams J. R. (1986). Outcomes of sexually open marriages. Journal of Sex Research, 22, 311‚Äì319. People who experience normal jealousy have at least nine strategies for coping with jealousy. The problem-solving strategies include: improving the primary relationship, interfering with the rival relationship, demanding commitment, and self-assessment. The emotion-focused strategies include: derogation of partner or rival, developing alternatives, denial/avoidance, support/catharsis, and appraisal challenge. These strategies are related to emotion regulation, conflict management, and cognitive change. Styles Couples in open marriages may prefer different kinds of extramarital relationships. Couples who prefer extramarital relationships emphasizing love and emotional involvement have a polyamorous style of open marriage. Couples who prefer extramarital relationships emphasizing sexual gratification and recreational friendships have a swinging style of open marriage. These distinctions may depend on psychological factors such as sociosexuality and may contribute to the formation of separate Polyamory and Swinging communities. Despite their distinctions, however, all open marriages share common issues: the lack of social acceptance, the need to maintain the health of their relationship and avoid neglect, and the need to manage jealous rivalry. Many open couples establish rules that forbid emotional attachment, extramarital children, extramarital sex in the marital bed, extramarital sex with those known to both partners, or extramarital sex without the use of barrier contraception. Some open marriages are one-sided. Some situations giving rise to this are where the libidos of partners differ greatly, or illness renders one partner incapable of, or no longer desiring, sex. The couple may remain together while one partner seeks out sexual gratification as he or she sees fit. The difference between these situations and a cheating situation is that both partners in the marriage are aware of, and agree to the arrangement. =Types of openness: from \\"polyamory style\\" to \\"swinging style\\"= Extramarital relationships vary in terms of the degree of sexual involvement desired and the degree of emotional involvement desired.Sprenkle, D.H., & Weis, D.L. (1978). Extramarital Sexuality: Implications for Marital Therapists. Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy, 4:279‚Äì291. Presented with the potentiality of non-monogamous intimacy, a given individual might be motivated more either by the desire for multiple sexual partners or a wider erotic experience than offered by monogamy, or by the desire for multiple others with whom to form an emotional or familial bond. Polyamory is motivated by a desire to expand love by developing emotionally involved relationships with extramarital partners. Swinging is motivated by a desire for physical gratification by engaging in sexual activities with extramarital partners. The distinction between polyamory and swinging applies to open marriages. Delineation of polyamory and swinging has appeared in academic literature,Jenks, R. (2001). The Lifestyle: A Look at the Erotic Rites of Swingers, by Terry Gould.

The Lifestyle: A Look at the Erotic Rites of Swingers. Canada: Vintage Books. \\"utopic swingers\\" and \\"recreational swingers\\".) A polyamorous style of open marriage emphasizes the expansion of loving relationships by developing emotional attachments to extramarital partners. A swinging style of open marriage emphasizes physical gratification by engaging in recreational sex with extramarital partners. =Psychological basis= The preference for a polyamorous versus a swinging style of open marriage may depend on many psychological factors. One factor may be sociosexuality,Ostovich, J.M., & Sabini, J. (2004). How are sociosexuality, sex drive, and lifetime number of sexual partners related? Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 30, pp. 1255‚Äì1266. an individual's willingness to engage in sexual behavior without having emotional ties to the sex partner. Individuals who are very willing to engage in sexual behavior without emotional ties are said to have unrestricted sociosexuality. Individuals who are very unwilling to engage in sexual behavior without emotional ties are said to have restricted sociosexuality. Individuals can vary along a continuum from unrestricted to restricted sociosexuality. =Community implications= Couples with different styles of open marriage tend to self-segregate in order to find others who share similar philosophies and interests, which has likely contributed to the development of separate polyamory and swinging communities. These offer informational resources and support, even if a given couple in an open marriage cannot see themselves joining either community. Some couples may not have a strong preference for either style of open marriage, feeling equally at home either community. The partners within a couple may differ in their respective preferences. One partner may prefer a polyamorous style of open marriage and participate in the Polyamory community, while the other partner may prefer a swinging style of open marriage and participate in the swinging community. Variations in couple preferences and individual preferences thus can result in overlap between the polyamory and swinging communities. Lack of acceptance =Christianity and other religions= Some critics object to open marriages on the ground that open marriages violate religious principles. For example, open marriages contradict traditional Christian doctrine. Open marriages also violate the prohibition against adultery in the Ten Commandments. The definition of sexual immorality in christianity includes the practices of open marriage and therefore it is considered an immutable reason for a dissolution of marriage. The Jewish religion hold similar values as Christianity in these matters. Muslims or Islamic teachings however allows for polygynous marriages albeit for the male partner only. Islam prohibits this practice for the female partner. The perceived validity of these objections depends entirely on individual faith. Arguments about faith, faith and rationality, and belief systems lie outside the scope of this article. Generally, non-monogamous people tend not to be very religious. A 1998 review observed that, across the various studies, most swingers (approximately two-thirds) claimed to have no religious affiliation.Jenks, R.J. (1998). Swinging: A review of the literature. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 27, 507‚Äì521. =Evidence of disapproval= Surveys show consistently high disapproval of extramarital sex. Hunt mentions three general-population surveys conducted in the 1960s in which large majorities disapproved of extramarital sex under any conditions. More recent surveys show that 75‚Äì85 percent of adults in the United States disapprove of extramarital sex.Glenn, N.D., & Weaver, C.N. (1979). Attitudes Toward Premarital, Extramarital, and Homosexual Relations in the U.S. in the 1970s. Journal of Sex Research 15, 108‚Äì118.Greeley, A.M., R. T. Michael, R.T., & Smith, T.W. (1990).

Journal of Marriage and the Family, 47, 173‚Äì179.Laumann, E.O., Gagnon, J.H., Michael, R.T., & Michaels, S. (1994). The social organization of sexuality: Sexual practices in the United States. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Similar levels of disapproval are observed in other Western societies. Widmer, Treas, and Newcomb surveyed over 33,500 people in 24 nations and found 85 percent of people believed extramarital sex was \\"always\\" or \\"nearly always\\" wrong.Widmer, E.D., Treas, J., & Newcomb, R. (1998). Attitudes toward nonmarital sex in 24 countries. Journal of Sex Research, 35, 349‚Äì358. Much of the disapproval is attributed to \\"religious and moral reasons.\\" A few studies have shown more direct disapproval of open marriage. In a national study of several hundred women and men, Hunt (1974) reported that around 75 percent of women and over 60 percent of men agreed with the statement \\"Mate-swapping is wrong.\\" A 1975 study of several hundred men and women living in the midwestern United States found that 93 percent would not consider participating in swinging. A 2005 study asked 111 college women about various forms of marriage and family.Billingham, R.E., Perera, P.B., & Ehlers, N.A. (2005). College women's rankings of the most undesirable marriage and family forms. College Student Journal, 39, 749‚Äì750. These young women viewed open marriage as one of the least desirable forms of marriage, with 94 percent saying they would never participate in a marriage where the man has a right to sex outside the marriage, and 91 percent saying they would never participate in a marriage where the woman has a right to sex outside the marriage. =Health concerns= Engaging in sex with a greater number of partners increases risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases. These concerns do not apply to open marriage alone, which would affect only 1 to 6 percent of the married population.Bartell, G.D. (1971). Group Sex. New York, NY: New American Library. A 1985 study found that 33 percent of male swingers and 10 percent of female swingers claimed to actively fear this risk.Murstein, B.I., Case, D., & Gunn, S.P. (1985). Personality correlates of ex-swingers. Lifestyles 8, 21‚Äì34. In another study, sexually transmitted diseases topped the list of disadvantages of swinging, and 58 percent of swingers expressed some fear of HIV/AIDS.Jenks, (1992). Fear of AIDS among swingers. Annals of Sex Research, 5, 227‚Äì237. Some couples have decided to drop out of open marriage lifestyles and become sexually monogamous in response to HIV/AIDS.Weinberg, M.S., Williams, C.J., & Pryor, D.W. (1995). Dual Attraction: Understanding Bisexuality. New York, NY: Oxford University Press. The risk of sexually transmitted diseases can be greatly reduced by practicing safer sex. However, the percentage of people in open marriages who practice safer sex remains disputed. Anecdotal observations range from claiming no one at a swing event practiced safer sex to claiming everyone at an event practiced safer sex. A survey of swingers found that \\"Over 62% said that they had changed their behaviors because of the AIDS scare. The two most frequently mentioned changes were being more selective with whom they swung and practicing safer sex (e.g., using condoms). Almost 7% said they had quit swinging because of the AIDS epidemic. Finally, one third said that they had not changed any of their habits, and, of these respondents, more than a third said nothing, not even AIDS, would get them to change.\\" Although a majority of swingers reported changing their behaviors in response to HIV/AIDS, some chose to become more selective in choosing partners rather than adopting safer sex practices. Greater selectivity in choosing partners is not a reliable means of reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS. Many people are not aware they are infected, and no outwards signs of infection may be visible. One psychological study suggests people may not be particularly good at detecting lies about HIV status.Swann,W.B., Silvera, D.H., & Proske, C.U. (1995). On knowing your partner: Dangerous illusions in the age of AIDS? Personal Relationships, 2, 173‚Äì186. Remarkably, one-third of swingers flatly rejected the idea of changing their behaviors in response to HIV/AIDS. These finding suggest people involved in open marriages may indeed be at somewhat greater risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. =Psychological factors= Several authors consider open marriages to be psychologically damaging. They claim sexual non-monogamy proves too difficult for most couples to manage, and their relationships suffer as a consequence.Levinger, G. (1979). A social psychological perspective on marital dissolution. In G. Levinger and O.C. Moles (Eds.), Divorce and Separation: Context, Causes, and Consequences. New York, NY: Basic Books.Bancroft, J. (1989). Human Sexuality and its Problems. Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone.Turner, J.S. (1996). Encyclopedia of Relationships across the Lifespan. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.Olds, J. & Schwartz, R.S. (2000). Marriage in Motion: The Natural Ebb and Flow of Lasting Relationships. Cambridge, MA: Perseus Books. These authors contend that sexual non-monogamy provokes jealousy in couples. This disrupts couples' sense of security in their relationships and interferes with their sense of intimacy. Consequently, these authors view open marriage as a \\"failed\\" lifestyle. Other studies have found that couples report high levels of satisfaction and enjoy long-lasting open marriages.Buunk B. (1980). Extramarital sex in the Netherlands: Motivations in social and marital context. Alternative Lifestyles, 3, 11‚Äì39.Rubin A. M. (1982). Sexually open versus sexually exclusive marriage: A comparison of dyadic adjustment. Alternative Lifestyles, 5, 101‚Äì108. Other couples drop out of the open marriage lifestyle and return to sexual monogamy. These couples may continue to view open marriage as a valid lifestyle for others, but not for themselves. Still other couples experience problems and report that open marriage contributed to their divorces.Denfeld, D. (1974). Dropouts from swinging. Family Coordinator, 23, 45-49. =Loss of social support= Strong social disapproval of open marriage may lead to a loss of psychological and health benefits. People in open marriages may hide their lifestyle from family, friends, and colleagues.Blumstein, , & Schwartz, P. (1983). American Couples: Money, Work, Sex. New York, NY: William Morrow and Company.Rust, P.C. (1996). Monogamy and polyamory: Relationship issues for bisexuals. In B.A. Firestein (Ed.), Bisexuality: The Psychology and Politics of an Invisible Minority (pages 127‚Äì148). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. Blumstein and Schwartz note: Keeping their lifestyles secret reduces the amount of social support available to people in open marriages. Incidence In 1983, Blumstein and Schwartz determined that out of 3,498 married men, 903 had an agreement with their spouses allowing extramarital sex; of these, 24 percent (217 men) actually engaged in extramarital sex during the previous year, and overall 6 percent had been actively involved in open marriages during the previous year. The number is only slightly less for women, where of 3,520 married women, 801 had an agreement with their spouses allowing extramarital sex, and 22 percent (or 176 women) actually engaged in extramarital sex during the previous year. This means about 5 percent of married women were actively involved in open marriages during the previous year. Those estimates are slightly higher than those from other researchers. Hunt, based on interviews from a 1974 national study of sexual behavior, estimated that 2% to 4% of the married population was involved in open marriages. Bartell (1971) estimated that two percent of the married population was involved in open marriages. The lowest estimate comes from a study conducted by Spanier and Cole (1975) of several hundred people living in the midwestern United States, which found 1.7 percent of married people involved in open marriages. Following the 1972 publication of Open Marriage, the popular media expressed a belief that open marriages were on the rise. However, Hunt concluded the incidence of extramarital sex had remained about the same for many years: Hunt attributed the mistaken impression of increasing open marriages to a barrage of books, articles, and television shows dealing with the topic. He also notes that speculative comments about increases in open marriage would sometimes be repeated often enough that people cited them as evidence. Nearly twenty years later (1993), in a national study of sexual behavior, Janus and Janus likewise denied that open marriages were on the rise, and suggested the number of open marriages may have declined: A large amount of media interest can mislead people into thinking the incidence of open marriage is on the rise. Conversely, media attention given to the marriage movement can mislead people into thinking the incidence of open marriage is declining. Weiss (1997) notes that \\"there is no scientific basis for concluding that these patterns increased in popularity earlier or that they have become less common in the 1980s and 1990s.\\"Weis, D.L.

The Pnyx with the carved steps of the speaker's platform in the centre The Pnyx (; ; , Pnyka) is a hill in central Athens, the capital of Greece. Beginning as early as 507 BC (Fifth-century Athens), the Athenians gathered on the Pnyx to host their popular assemblies, thus making the hill one of the earliest and most important sites in the creation of democracy. The Pnyx is located less than west of the Acropolis and 1.6 km south-west of the centre of Athens, Syntagma Square. Historical significance The Pnyx was used for popular assemblies in Athens as early as 507 BC, when the reforms of Cleisthenes transferred political power to the citizenry. It was then outside the city proper, but close enough to be convenient. It looks down on the ancient Agora, which was the commercial and social centre of the city. At this site all the great political struggles of Athens of the \\"Golden Age\\" were fought out. Pericles, Aristides and Alcibiades spoke here, within sight of the Parthenon, temple of Athena. Here Demosthenes delivered his vilifications of Philip II of Macedon. The area The Pnyx is a small, rocky hill surrounded by parkland, with a large flat platform of eroded stone set into its side, and by steps carved on its slope. It was the meeting place of one of the world's earliest known democratic legislatures, the Athenian ekklesia (assembly), and the flat stone platform was the bema, the \\"stepping stone\\" or speakers' platform. This was the oratorical platform from which noted politicians such as Pericles and orators \\"fulmined over Greece.\\" Some scholars note that the environs and position of the Pnyx as well as its openness and objects of appeal, provided the ancient Greek speakers with the inspiration that not even the Roman Forum could rival. It is described as a result of previous reforms that included the utilization of demography and topography for the purpose of serving the interests of a rhetorical culture. As such, the Pnyx is the material embodiment of the principle of isƒìgor√≠a (Greek: ·º∞œÉŒ∑Œ≥ŒøœÅŒØŒ±), \\"equal speech\\", i.e. the equal right of every citizen to debate matters of policy. The other two principles of democracy were isonom√≠a (Greek: ·º∞œÉŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒØŒ±), equality under the law, and isopolite√≠a (Greek: ·º∞œÉŒøœÄŒøŒªŒπœÑŒµŒØŒ±), equality of vote and equal opportunity to assume political office. The right of isƒìgor√≠a was expressed by the presiding officer of the Pnyx assembly, who formally opened each debate with the open invitation \\"T√≠s agore√∫ein bo√∫letai?\\" (Greek: \\"Œ§ŒØœÇ ·ºÄŒ≥ŒøœÅŒµœçŒµŒπŒΩ Œ≤ŒøœçŒªŒµœÑŒ±Œπ;\\", \\"Who wishes to speak to the Popular Assembly?\\"). The Pnyx was protected by a defense wall built in the fourth century BC and reconstructed a century later. The new walls, made of almost solid masonry and ashlar blocks, were two-meter thick. The stretch began on a northern end with a tower that stood south of the Melitides Gate of the Themistoclean Wall and ended at the western end of the summit where it joined the Diateichisma. The wall featured seven towers set with 40-meter interval while the connecting walls were strengthened by buttresses. Early history and phases The Pnyx was the official meeting place of the Athenian democratic assembly (). In the earliest days of Athenian democracy (after the reforms of Kleisthenes in 508 B.C.), the ekklesia met in the Agora. Sometime in the early 5th century, the meeting place was moved to a hill south and west of the Acropolis. This new meeting place came to be called \\"Pnyx\\" (from the Greek word meaning \\"tightly packed together\\". In the early history of the Pnyx, three phases can be distinguished:The Pnyx // The Stoa: A Consortium for Electronic Publication in the Humanities Pnyx I: Probably constructed in the early 5th century. The people apparently sat on the hillside facing a speaker's platform on the north. The seating capacity may have been anywhere from 6000 to 13,000 people. This phase is represented archaeologically only by a few cuttings in the bedrock and a boundary stone (not found in situ), so that it is impossible to determine the date and size with any precision. Pnyx II: Probably late 5th century B.C. In this phase the orientation of the auditorium was apparently reversed (a reconstruction that is based more upon ancient literary sources than from the actual archaeological record). A stepped terrace wall was created on the north to support an artificial terrace, and the people sat facing a speaker's platform on the south. Some sources stated that this retaining wall was constructed around 500 BC for the purpose of holding the soil that was brought in to form the level space for the bema. Part of the stepped terrace wall is preserved, as well as a staircase with rock-cut steps leading up to it from the direction of the Agora. The size of the auditorium (as it is restored by the excavators) is not that much larger than Pnyx I. Pnyx III: The Pnyx was rebuilt and expanded in the 3rd quarter of the 4th century B.C., probably around 345-335 B.C. A massive, curved, retaining wall was built (or at least begun) on the north. The southern side of the auditorium and speaker's platform (bema) were quarried out of the natural bedrock. (Traces of the quarrying process can still be seen at the eastern side of the great rock-cut scarp). On a terrace above (south of) the speaker's platform, the foundations were begun for 2 long stoas (but these seem never to have been finished). It is unknown for how many years Pnyx III was used as the meeting place of the ekklesia, and certainly by the 1st century B.C. the assembly held their meetings in the Theater of Dionysos on the South Slope of the Acropolis. Finally, in the Roman period, part of the Pnyx was used as a sanctuary of Zeus Hypsistos. Evidence for the sanctuary consist of c. 50 niches for votive plaques cut into the bedrock scarp east of the speaker's platform. Many of the votive plaques are carved with representations of human body parts (eyes, breasts, etc.), suggesting that this Zeus Hypsistos was a healing divinity. Athenian democracy Scholars such as Mogens Herman Hansen suggest the Pnyx was able to hold about 6,000 citizens, though later expansions may have accommodated 8,000 or as many as 13,000. French classical scholar Robert Flaceli√®re states that the Pnyx had enough standing room for as many as 20,000 citizens,Robert Flaceli√®re (1959) La Vie Quotidienne en Gr√®ce au Si√®cle de P√©ricl√®s, Librairie Hachette, Paris. though this is disputed. The grassy area in front of the bema was in ancient times an area of bare rock, on which about 6,000 men could stand. This can be taken as a reasonable estimate of the number of politically active citizens (citizens were free males born in the city, or perhaps 20% of the adult population). There were wooden seats for the members of the Council of 500, who were selected by lot for terms of a single year to run the city on a day- to-day basis, and prepare the agenda for the Assembly. In later times two stoae, or covered galleries, were built to protect the dignitaries against the rain and sun. In theory, all citizens were equal and all had the right to speak. In practice, relatively few citizens actually spoke or proposed actions. A citizen who made a proposal might be subjected to a future prosecution (graphe paranomon) if the proposal was illegal or came to be seen as detrimental to Athens. There was a rule that citizens aged over 50 had a right to be heard first. Democratic government at Athens was suspended in 411 BC and again in 404 BC with the assumption of power by oligarchies during crises in the Peloponnesian War. The Spartans and their allies in Athens installed a dictatorship, called the Thirty Tyrants, but in 403 BC the democrats seized power again and the meetings at the Pnyx resumed. Athens lost its independence to Philip II of Macedon after the battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC; but they continued to run their internal affairs democratically until the coup by Demetrius of Phaleron in 322 BC. After his fall, the Athenians continued to run their internal affairs according to democratic forms for centuries. Excavations Albumen print of carved speaker's staircase of the Pnyx, taken circa 1865-1895, looking west. Excavations at the site were begun in 1910 by the Greek Archaeological Society and definitely confirmed the site as the Pnyx. Large-scale excavations were conducted at various times between 1930 and 1937 by Homer Thompson, in collaboration first with K. Kourouniotes and later with Robert Scranton. These excavations discovered the foundations of the important buildings at the Pnyx, although nothing else remains of them. These included the two large stoas, erected between 330 and 326 BC, the Altar of Zeus Agoraios, erected at the same time, but removed during the reign of Augustus (first century BC), and the Sanctuary of Zeus Hypsistos. Most of these buildings were erected after the Pnyx had lost its real significance. West to the Altar of Zeus are the foundations of Meton's heliotropion, the oldest known astronomical observatory, where he performed several of his measurements that led to the calculations involving the eponymous 19-year Metonic cycle which he introduced in 432 BC into the lunisolar Attic calendar, a calendar that appears in the Antikythera Mechanism. Today the site of the Pnyx is under the control of the Ephorate of Prehistorical and Classical Antiquities of the Greek Ministry of Culture. The surrounding parkland is fenced, but can be visited free of charge at any time.

He was instrumental in investigating and extending Karl Jansky's pioneering work, and conducted the first sky survey in the radio frequencies. His 1937 radio antenna was the second ever to be used for astronomical purposes and the first parabolic reflecting antenna to be used as a radio telescope.Gerrit L. Verschuur, The invisible universe: the story of radio astronomy, p. 14 For nearly a decade he was the world's only radio astronomer.Wayne Orchiston, The New Astronomy: Opening the Electromagnetic Window and Expanding our View of Planet Earth: A Meeting to Honor Woody Sullivan on his 60th Birthday, Springer Science & Business Media ‚Äì 2006, p. 63Robert Bless (1996), Discovering the Cosmos, University Science Books, p. 215 Life Reber was born and raised in Wheaton, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, and graduated from Armour Institute of Technology (now Illinois Institute of Technology) in 1933 with a degree in electrical engineering. He was an amateur radio operator, and worked for various radio manufacturers in Chicago from 1933 to 1947. When he learned of Karl Jansky's work in 1933, NYTimes for-pay article John David North, Cosmos: an illustrated history of astronomy and cosmology. University of Chicago Press, 2008, p.661. Kip S. Thorne (1994), Black holes and time warps: Einstein's outrageous legacy. W. W. Norton & Company, p. 324. he decided this was the field he wanted to work in, and applied to Bell Labs, where Jansky was working. However, this was during the height of the Great Depression and there were no jobs available. =Early experimentation= Reber Radio Telescope in Wheaton, Illinois, 1937 In the summer of 1937, Reber decided to build his own radio telescope in his back yard in Wheaton, IL. Reber's radio telescope was considerably more advanced than Jansky's, and consisted of a parabolic sheet metal dish 9 meters in diameter, focusing to a radio receiver 8 meters above the dish. The entire assembly was mounted on a tilting stand, allowing it to be pointed in various directions, though not turned. The telescope was completed in September 1937. NRAO bio, photosNRAO timeline Reber's first receiver operated at 3300 MHz and failed to detect signals from outer space, as did his second, operating at 900 MHz. Finally, his third attempt, at 160 MHz, was successful in 1938, confirming Jansky's discovery. In 1940, he achieved his first professional publication, in the Astrophysical Journal, but Reber refused a research appointment with Yerkes Observatory.Thorne, p. 327. He turned his attention to making a radiofrequency sky map, which he completed in 1941 and extended in 1943. He published a considerable body of work during this era, and was the initiator of the \\"explosion\\" of radio astronomy in the immediate post-Second World War era. His data, published as contour maps showing the brightness of the sky in radio wavelengths, revealed the existence of radio sources such as Cygnus A and Cassiopeia A for the first time. For nearly a decade from 1937 on he was the world's only radio astronomer, a field that only expanded after World War Two when scientists, who had gained a great deal of knowledge during the wartime expansion of RADAR, entered the field.Wayne Orchiston, The New Astronomy: Opening the Electromagnetic Window and Expanding our View of Planet Earth: A Meeting to Honor Woody Sullivan on his 60th Birthday, Springer Science & Business Media ‚Äì 2006, p. 63 During this time he uncovered a mystery that was not explained until the 1950s. The standard theory of radio emissions from space was that they were due to black-body radiation, light (of which radio is a non-visible form) that is given off by all hot bodies. Using this theory one would expect that there would be considerably more high-energy light than low-energy, due to the presence of stars and other hot bodies. However Reber demonstrated that the reverse was true, and that there was a considerable amount of low-energy radio signal. It was not until the 1950s that synchrotron radiation was offered as an explanation for these measurements. Reber sold his telescope to the National Bureau of Standards, and it was erected on a turntable at their field station in Sterling, Virginia. Eventually the telescope made its way to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia,Sullivan, W.T. (1984). The Early Years of Radio Astronomy. Cambridge University Press. p. 48 and Reber supervised its reconstruction at that site. Reber also helped with a reconstruction of Jansky's original telescope. =Medium frequency research= Reconstructed Reber Radio Telescope at National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia Starting in 1951, he received generous support from the Research Corporation in New York, and moved to Hawaii.Smithsonian/NASA bio In the 1950s, he wanted to return to active studies but much of the field was already filled with very large and expensive instruments. Instead he turned to a field that was being largely ignored, that of medium frequency (hectometre) radio signals in the 0.5‚Äì3 MHz range, around the AM broadcast bands. However, signals with frequencies below 30 MHz are reflected by an ionized layer in the Earth's atmosphere called the ionosphere. In 1954, Reber moved to Tasmania, the southernmost state of Australia, where he worked with Bill Ellis at the University of Tasmania.utas.edu.au Companion to Tasmanian History: Astronomy There, on very cold, long, winter nights the ionosphere would, after many hours shielded from the sun's radiation by the bulk of the Earth, 'quieten' and de-ionize, allowing the longer radio waves into his antenna array. Reber described this as being a \\"fortuitous situation\\". Tasmania also offered low levels of man-made radio noise, which permitted reception of the faint signals from outer space. In the 1960s, he had an array of dipoles set up on the sheep grazing property of Dennistoun, about 7.5 km northeast of the town of Bothwell, Tasmania, where he lived in a house of his own design and construction he decided to build after he purchased a job lot of coach bolts at a local auction. He imported 4x8 douglas fir beams directly from a sawmill in Oregon, and then high technology double glazed window panes, also from the US. The bolts held the house together. The window panes formed a north facing passive solar wall, heating mat black painted, dimpled copper sheets, from which the warmed air rose by convection. The interior walls were lined with reflective rippled aluminium foil. The house was so well thermally insulated that the oven in the kitchen was nearly unusable because the heat from it, unable to escape, would raise the temperature of the room to over 50 ¬∞C (120 ¬∞F). =Final years= His house was never completely finished. It was meant to have a passive heat storage device, in the form of a thermally insulated pit full of dolerite rocks, underneath, but although his mind was sharp, his body started to fail him in his later years, and he was never able to move the rocks. He was fascinated by mirrors and had at least one in every room. He had one of the amplifiers from the prime focus of his first telescope, probably the one used at 900 MHz. It was of compact point-to-point construction and used two R.C.A. type 955 \\"acorn\\" thermionic valves. All the rubber-insulated wires in it had perished and the rubber was hard and crumbly. He powered this amplifier, and all his later receivers at Dennistoun, from batteries, to avoid interference entering the equipment along power cables. His memorial plaque at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory Memorial at Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope Reber was not a believer of the big bang theory; he believed that red shift was due to repeated absorption and re-emission or interaction of light and other electromagnetic radiations by low density dark matter, over intergalactic distances, and he published an article called \\"Endless, Boundless, Stable Universe\\", which outlined his theory.Reber, G. (1977). Endless, Boundless, Stable Universe . Hobart, University of Tasmania (Occasional Papers, No. 9). Reber was supportive of the Tired light explanation for the redshift-distance relationship.Reber, G. (1982). A Timeless, Boundless, Equilibrium Universe. Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of Australia 4: 482‚Äì483. He was looked after in his final days at the Ouse District Hospital, about 50 km northwest of Hobart, Tasmania, where he died in 2002, two days before his 91st birthday. His ashes are located at Bothwell Cemetery, just past New Norfolk in Tasmania and at many major radio observatories around the world: * Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory and Grote Reber Museum, Cambridge, Tasmania, Australia * Parkes Observatory, Parkes, New South Wales, Australia * Molonglo Observatory, Bungendore, New South Wales, Australia * Dwingeloo Radio Observatory, Netherlands * Jodrell Bank, Cheshire, England * Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory, Cambridgeshire, England * Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, British Columbia, Canada * NASA Goldstone Apple Valley Radio Telescope, California * United States Naval Observatory, D.C. * National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Greenbank, West Virginia * Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico * University of Illinois Radio Telescope, Vermillion County, Illinois * University of California at Davis * University of Hawaii, on the summit of Haleakala * Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, India * Tuorla Observatory, Turku, Finland * Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory, Russia Honorary awards * Honorary Doctor of Science degree from Ohio State University (1962) * Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (1962) * Henry Norris Russell Lectureship (1962) * Elliott Cresson Medal of the Franklin Institute (physics, 1963) * Jackson-Gwilt Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1983) Legacy * Asteroid 6886 Grote * The Grote Reber Medal was established by the Trustees of the Grote Reber Foundation.Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery * Grote Reber Museum at the Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory, Cambridge, Tasmania, opened 20 January 2008Museum marks life of first radio astronomer, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 18 January 2008 (accessed 24 January 2008) See also * John D.

These are spread by blood-feeding insects such as black flies and mosquitoes. They belong to the group of diseases called helminthiases. Eight known filarial worms have humans as a definitive host. These are divided into three groups according to the part of the body they affect: *Lymphatic filariasis is caused by the worms Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. These worms occupy the lymphatic system, including the lymph nodes; in chronic cases, these worms lead to the syndrome of elephantiasis. *Subcutaneous filariasis is caused by Loa loa (the eye worm), Mansonella streptocerca, and Onchocerca volvulus. These worms occupy the layer just under the skin. L. loa causes Loa loa filariasis, while O. volvulus causes river blindness. *Serous cavity filariasis is caused by the worms Mansonella perstans and Mansonella ozzardi, which occupy the serous cavity of the abdomen. Dirofilaria immitis, the dog heartworm, rarely infects humans. The adult worms, which usually stay in one tissue, release early larval forms known as microfilariae into the person's blood. These circulating microfilariae can be taken up during a blood meal by an insect vector; in the vector, they develop into infective larvae that can be spread to another person. Individuals infected by filarial worms may be described as either \\"microfilaraemic\\" or \\"amicrofilaraemic\\", depending on whether microfilariae can be found in their peripheral blood. Filariasis is diagnosed in microfilaraemic cases primarily through direct observation of microfilariae in the peripheral blood. Occult filariasis is diagnosed in amicrofilaraemic cases based on clinical observations and, in some cases, by finding a circulating antigen in the blood. Signs and symptoms: The most spectacular symptom of lymphatic filariasis is elephantiasis ‚Äì edema with thickening of the skin and underlying tissues‚Äîwhich was the first disease discovered to be transmitted by mosquito bites. Elephantiasis results when the parasites lodge in the lymphatic system. Elephantiasis affects mainly the lower extremities, while the ears, mucous membranes, and amputation stumps are affected less frequently. However, different species of filarial worms tend to affect different parts of the body; Wuchereria bancrofti can affect the legs, arms, vulva, breasts, and scrotum (causing hydrocele formation), while Brugia timori rarely affects the genitals. Those who develop the chronic stages of elephantiasis are usually free from microfilariae (amicrofilaraemic), and often have adverse immunological reactions to the microfilariae, as well as the adult worms. The subcutaneous worms present with rashes, urticarial papules, and arthritis, as well as hyper- and hypopigmentation macules. Onchocerca volvulus manifests itself in the eyes, causing \\"river blindness\\" (onchocerciasis), one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. Serous cavity filariasis presents with symptoms similar to subcutaneous filariasis, in addition to abdominal pain, because these worms are also deep-tissue dwellers. Cause: Human filarial nematode worms have complicated life cycles, which primarily consists of five stages. After the male and female worms mate, the female gives birth to live microfilariae by the thousands. The microfilariae are taken up by the vector insect (intermediate host) during a blood meal. In the intermediate host, the microfilariae molt and develop into third-stage (infective) larvae. Upon taking another blood meal, the vector insect, such as Culex pipiens, injects the infectious larvae into the dermis layer of the skin. After about one year, the larvae molt through two more stages, maturing into the adult worms. Diagnosis: Microfilaria of Dirofilaria immitis (Heartworms) in a lymph node of a dog with lymphoma. This baby nematode is in a pillow of intermediate-to-large, immature lymphocytes, exhibiting multiple criteria of cancer. Filariasis is usually diagnosed by identifying microfilariae on Giemsa stained, thin and thick blood film smears, using the \\"gold standard\\" known as the finger prick test. The finger prick test draws blood from the capillaries of the finger tip; larger veins can be used for blood extraction, but strict windows of the time of day must be observed. Blood must be drawn at appropriate times, which reflect the feeding activities of the vector insects. Examples are W. bancrofti, whose vector is a mosquito; night is the preferred time for blood collection. Loa loa's vector is the deer fly; daytime collection is preferred. This method of diagnosis is only relevant to microfilariae that use the blood as transport from the lungs to the skin. Some filarial worms, such as M. streptocerca and O. volvulus, produce microfilarae that do not use the blood; they reside in the skin only. For these worms, diagnosis relies upon skin snips and can be carried out at any time. = Concentration methods = Various concentration methods are applied: membrane filter, Knott's concentration method, and sedimentation technique. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antigenic assays, which detect circulating filarial antigens, are also available for making the diagnosis. The latter are particularly useful in amicrofilaraemic cases. Spot tests for antigenare far more sensitive, and allow the test to be done anytime, rather in the late hours. Lymph node aspirate and chylous fluid may also yield microfilariae. Medical imaging, such as CT or MRI, may reveal \\"filarial dance sign\\" in the chylous fluid; X-ray tests can show calcified adult worms in lymphatics. The DEC provocation test is performed to obtain satisfying numbers of parasites in daytime samples. Xenodiagnosis is now obsolete, and eosinophilia{{cite webhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/eosinophilia/basics/definition/sym-20050752 is a nonspecific primary sign. Treatment The recommended treatment for people outside the United States is albendazole combined with ivermectin. A combination of diethylcarbamazine and albendazole is also effective. Side effects of the drugs include nausea, vomiting, and headaches. All of these treatments are microfilaricides; they have no effect on the adult worms. While the drugs are critical for treatment of the individual, proper hygiene is also required. There is good evidence that albendazole alone; or addition of albendazole to diethylcarbamazine or ivermectin, makes minimal difference in clearing microfilaria or adult worms from blood circulation. Diethylcarbamazine-medicated salt is effective in controlling lymphatic filariasis while maintaining its coverage at 90% in the community for six months. Different trials were made to use the known drug at its maximum capacity in absence of new drugs. In a study from India, it was shown that a formulation of albendazole had better anti-filarial efficacy than albendazole itself. In 2003, the common antibiotic doxycycline was suggested for treating elephantiasis. Filarial parasites have symbiotic bacteria in the genus Wolbachia, which live inside the worm and seem to play a major role in both its reproduction and the development of the disease. This drug has shown signs of inhibiting the reproduction of the bacteria, further inducing sterility. Clinical trials in June 2005 by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine reported an eight-week course almost completely eliminated microfilaraemia. Society and culture = Research teams = In 2015 William C. Campbell and Satoshi ≈åmura were co-awarded half of that year's Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the drug avermectin, which, in the further developed form ivermectin, has decreased the occurrence of lymphatic filariasis. =Prospects for elimination= Filarial diseases in humans offer prospects for elimination by means of vermicidal treatment. If the human link in the chain of infection can be broken, then notionally the disease could be wiped out in a season. In practice it is not quite so simple, and there are complications in that multiple species overlap in certain regions and double infections are common. This creates difficulties for routine mass treatment because people with onchocerciasis in particular react badly to treatment for lymphatic filariasis. Other animals Filariasis can also affect domesticated animals, such as cattle, sheep, and dogs. =Cattle=: * Verminous hemorrhagic dermatitis is a clinical disease in cattle due to Parafilaria bovicola. * Intradermal onchocerciasis of cattle results in losses in leather due to Onchocerca dermata, O. ochengi, and O. dukei. O. ochengi is closely related to human O. volvulus (river blindness), sharing the same vector, and could be useful in human medicine research. * Stenofilaria assamensis and others cause different diseases in Asia, in cattle and zebu. =Horses= * \\"Summer bleeding\\" is hemorrhagic subcutaneous nodules in the head and upper forelimbs, caused by Parafilaria multipapillosa (North Africa, Southern and Eastern Europe, Asia and South America). =Dogs= * Heart filariasis is caused by Dirofilaria immitis.

Unlike some color reversal processes (such as Kodachrome K-14) that produce positive transparencies, E-6 processing can be performed by individual users with the same equipment that is used for processing black and white negative film or C-41 color negative film. The process is highly sensitive to temperature variations: A heated water bath is mandatory to stabilize the temperature at 100.0 ¬∞F (37.8 ¬∞C) for the first developer and first wash to maintain process tolerances.  History  The E-6 process superseded Kodak's E-3 and E-4 processes. The E-3 process required fogging with light to accomplish image reversal and produced transparencies that faded quickly. The E-4 process used polluting chemicals, such as a highly toxic reversal agent borane tert-butylamine (TBAB).  Process variations  There are two versions of the E-6 process. Commercial laboratories use a six-bath chemical process. The 'hobby' type chemistry kits, such as those produced by Tetenal, use three chemical baths that combine the color developer and fogging bath solutions, and the pre-bleach, bleach and fixer bath solutions. The three-bath process has a discrete color developer step in between.Rinses, washes, stop baths and stabilizer/final rinse (the final step of the process) are not counted in the counting of baths when describing both the conventional six bath and hobbyist three bath processes.  Six-bath process version  The steps for developing color transparency films using process E6 are: * First developer bath: 6:00 @ 100.0 ¬∞F (37.8 ¬∞C). This uses a potassium hydroquinone monosulfate - phenidone black & white film developer, with the preferred form of phenidone being 4-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidinone (13047-13-7). The first developer forms a negative silver image in each layer of the film. The first developer is time and temperature sensitive because it controls contrast. * First wash: Water stop bath, 2:00 @ 100.0 ¬∞F (37.8 ¬∞C). This step once used an acetic acid stop bath, but was replaced with a water-only bath for process economy, with concomitant slight reduction of first developer strength. * Reversal bath: 2:00 @ 96-103 ¬∞F (35.6-39.4 ¬∞C). This bath prepares the film for the color developer step. A chemical reversal agent is absorbed into the emulsion, which is instantly effective. The reversal step can also be carried out using 800 footcandle-seconds (8.6 klx¬∑s) of light - this variation is used by process engineers to troubleshoot reversal bath chemistry problems such as contamination and issues of low tank turnover as process volumes decline. * Color developer bath: 6:00 @ 96-103 ¬∞F (35.6-39.4 ¬∞C). This step is carried out to completion. The developer contains CD-3 developing agent, and acts upon the chemically exposed silver halide that was not developed in the first developer to form a positive silver image. The metallic negative silver image formed in the first developer has no part in the reaction of this step. As the color development progresses, a metallic positive silver image is formed and the color developing agent is oxidized. Oxidized color developer molecules react with the color couplers and color dyes are formed in each of the three layers of the film. Each layer of the film contains different color couplers, which react with the same oxidized developer molecules but form different color dyes. Variation in color developer pH causes color shifts on the green- magenta axis with Kodak E100G & E100GX and Fujichrome films and on the yellow- blue axis with older Ektachrome films. * Pre-bleach bath: 2:00 @ 90-103 ¬∞F (32.2-39.4 ¬∞C). This bath was previously called \\"conditioner\\", but was renamed pre-bleach in the mid-1990s to reflect the removal of formaldehyde from the process used in the final rinse. In this solution, formaldehyde acts as a dye preservative and EDTA is used to \\"kick off\\" the bleach. The pre-bleach bath relies on carry-over of the color developer to function properly, therefore there is no wash step between the color developer and pre-bleach baths. * Bleach bath: 6:00 @ 92-103 ¬∞F (33.3-39.4 ¬∞C). This is a process-to-completion step, and relies on carry-over of pre-bleach to initiate the bleach. The bleach converts metallic silver into silver bromide, which is converted to soluble silver compounds by the fixer. During bleaching, iron (III) EDTA is converted to iron (II) EDTA (Fe3+ EDTA + Ag + Br‚àí‚Üí Fe2+ EDTA + AgBr) before fixing. Kodak also has a process variant which uses a higher concentration of bleach and a 4:00 bath time; but with process volumes declining, this variant has become uneconomical. * Wash step (optional): Rinses off the bleach and extends the life of the fixer bath. This wash step is recommended for rotary tube, sink line and other low volume processing. * Fixer bath: 4:00 @ 92-103 ¬∞F (33.3-39.4 ¬∞C). This is a process-to-completion step. * Second fixer stage (optional): Using fresh fixer. The archival properties of film and paper are greatly improved using a second fixing stage in a reverse cascade. Note that this is the Photo.Net discussion thread of the 1998 technical paper by Dr. Michael J. Gudzinowicz. Many C-41RA (rapid access) minilab processors also use 2 stage reverse cascade fixing for faster throughput. * Final wash: 4:00 @ 92-103 ¬∞F (33.3-39.4 ¬∞C). * Final rinse: 1:00 @ 80-103 ¬∞F (26.7-39.4 ¬∞C). Up until the mid-1990s, the final rinse was called a stabilizer bath, since it contained formaldehyde. Currently, the final rinse uses a surfactant, and miconazole, an anti-fungal agent. * Drying: Drying in a dust-free environment.

The expression can be extended to refer to the general conflict in Bolivia over the exploitation of gas resources, thus including the 2005 protests and the election of Evo Morales as president. Before these protests, Bolivia had seen a series of similar earlier protests during the Cochabamba protests of 2000, which were against the privatization of the municipal water supply. The conflict had its roots in grievances over the government's economic policies concerning natural gas, as well as coca eradication policies, corruption and violent military responses against strikes. On a larger scale, it can be traced to Bolivia's colonization since the 15th century and the subsequent exploitation of its natural resources (e.g., the mines of Potos√≠). The \\"Bolivian gas war\\" thus came to a head in October 2003, leading to the resignation of President Gonzalo S√°nchez de Lozada (aka \\"Goni\\"). Strikes and road blocks mounted by indigenous and labour groups (including the COB trade union) brought the country to a standstill. Violent suppression by the Bolivian armed forces left some 60 people dead in October 2003, mostly inhabitants of El Alto, located on the Altiplano above the capital city of La Paz. The governing coalition disintegrated forcing Goni to resign and leave the country on October 18, 2003. He was succeeded by the vice president, Carlos Mesa, who put the gas issue to a referendum on July 18, 2004. In May 2005, under duress from protesters, the Bolivian congress enacted a new hydrocarbons law, increasing the state's royalties from natural gas exploitation. However, protesters, who included Evo Morales and Felipe Quispe, demanded full nationalization of hydrocarbon resources, and the increased participation of Bolivia's indigenous majority, mainly composed of Aymaras and Quechuas, in the political life of the country. On June 6, 2005, Mesa was forced to resign as tens of thousands of protesters caused daily blockades to La Paz from the rest of the country. Morales' election at the end of 2005 was met with enthusiasm by the social movements, because he was, as the leader of left-wing MAS, one of the staunchest opponents to the exportation of the gas without corresponding industrialization in Bolivia. On May 1, 2006, President Morales signed a decree stating that all gas reserves were to be nationalized: \\"the state recovers ownership, possession and total and absolute control\\" of hydrocarbons. The 2006 announcement was met by applause on La Paz's main plaza, where Vice President Alvaro Garcia told the crowd that the government's energy-related revenue would jump US$320 million to US$780 million in 2007, continuing a trend where revenues had expanded nearly sixfold between 2002 and 2006. Background =Gas reserves of Bolivia= 2003 demonstrations against president Gonzalo S√°nchez de Lozada. \\"The gas is ours by right, to recover it is our duty.\\" The central issue was Bolivia's large natural gas reserves and the prospect for their future sale and use. The Bolivian gas reserves are the second largest in South America after Venezuela, and exploration after the privatization of the national oil company YPFB showed that proven natural gas reserves were 600% higher than previously known. The cash-poor, state-owned company could not afford the exploration costs. These reserves mainly are located in the southeastern Tarija Department, which contains 85% of gas and petrol reserves. According to the United States Department of Energy, another 10.6% is located within the department of Santa Cruz and 2.5% in the Cochabamba Department. After further exploration from 1996 to 2002, the estimated size of the probable gas reserves was calculated to be 12.5 times larger, passing from to . This number has declined somewhat to probable reserves. The proven reserves are . With the declining importance of tin mines, those reserves accounted for the majority of foreign investment in Bolivia. The price which Bolivia is paid for its natural gas is roughly US to Brazil and $3.18 per million BTU to Argentina. Other sources state that Brazil pays between $3.15 and $3.60 per million BTU, not including $1.50 per million BTU in Petrobras extraction and transportation costs. As a comparison, the price of gas in the US as a whole in 2006 varied between US, although some years earlier the price of natural gas spiked at $14 per million BTU in California due to lack of pipeline capacity to and within California as well as due to electricity outages. While according to Le Monde, Brazil and Argentina pay US$2 per thousand cubic meter of gas, which costs from $12 to $15 in California. In 1994, a contract with Brazil was passed, two years before 1996's privatization of the 70-year-old, state-owned Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales de Bolivia (YPFB). The construction of the Bolivia- Brazil gas pipeline cost US$2.2 billion. A consortium called Pacific LNG was formed to exploit the newly discovered reserves. The consortium comprised the British companies BG Group and BP, and Spain's Repsol YPF. Repsol is one of three companies that dominate the gas sector in Bolivia, along with Petrobras and Total. A plan costing US$6 billion was drawn to build a pipeline to the Pacific coast, where the gas would be processed and liquefied before being shipped to Mexico and the United States (Baja California and California), through a Chilean port, for example Iquique. The 2003 Lozada deal was opposed heavily by Bolivian society, in part because of nationalism (Bolivia feels resentment after the territorial losses of the War of the Pacific in the late 19th century, which deprived it of the Litoral province and hence access to the sea). Government ministers hoped to use the gas profits to bolster the sagging Bolivian economy and claimed the money would be invested exclusively in health and education. Opponents argued that under the current law, the exportation of the gas as a raw material would give Bolivia only 18% of the future profits, or US$40 million to US$70 million per year. They further argued that exporting the gas so cheaply would be the latest case of foreign exploitation of Bolivia's natural resources, starting with its silver and gold from the 17th century. They demanded that a plant be built in Bolivia to process the gas and that domestic consumption had to be met before export. As Le Monde puts it, \\"two reasons plead for the industrial exploitation of the gas, which the multinational companies now have the capacities of doing. The first is related to the necessity of satisfying the Bolivians' energy needs. The second demonstrates the interest of exporting a more profitable product rather than selling raw material\\". According to the French newspaper, only La Paz, El Alto, Sucre, Potos√≠, Camiri and Santa Cruz are now connected to the gas network; making an interior network which would reach all Bolivians would cost $1.5 billion, notwithstanding a central gas pipeline to link the various regions together. According to Carlos Miranda, an independent expert quoted by Le Monde, the best industrialisation project is the petrochemical complex proposed by the Brazilian Braskem firm, which would create 40 000 direct or indirect jobs and cost $1.4 billion. This figure is equivalent to the amount so far invested by Repsol, Total and Petrobras. = Santa Cruz autonomy movement = The wealthier, eastern departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Tarija, and Pando recently had been mobilizing in favor of autonomy. Important issues were opposition to the seizure of resources though nationalization, the confiscation of land from local control by outside ethnic groups (mainly the Aymara and Quechua), and a greater share of taxes collected within Santa Cruz to support roads and schools. Community leaders are supported by the Comite Pro Santa Cruz, local co-ops, and by business organizations such as cattle ranchers and farmers. A strike against the new constitution was recently held which was observed in Santa Cruz, Beni, Tarija, and Pando. Tensions have been raised by the cultural and philosophical rift exposed by the push for a new constitution. As a basis for a new constitution, the western, Altiplano-based MAS party envisions a \\"council of indigenous peoples\\" along with a curtailment of private ownership, while Santa Cruz looks to western culture and capitalism. Cultural divisions exist because people in eastern Bolivia, called \\"Cambas\\" (meaning \\"friends\\" in Guarani), are primarily of mestizo descent (mix of European and several native tribes the largest of which are the Guaran√≠), while the western Altiplano is dominated by a small white elite and a historically oppressed Quechua and Aymara majority. The first signs of the modern autonomy movement occurred in 2005 when a march for autonomy was attended by hundreds of thousands of people El Mundo - Prensa Mayor. A result of this was the change in law to allow the election of departmental prefects. Another area of tension was the result of ongoing population shifts and the resulting demands for proportionally greater representation in Bolivia's Congress to reflect these shifts by Santa Cruz. A compromise was reached to allow Santa Cruz to receive some of the seats warranted by population growth, and for the highlands to keep seats despite population losses. Left-wing intellectuals Walter Ch√°vez and √Ålvaro Garc√≠a Linera (the current Bolivian Vice President and MAS party member) published an article in the Monthly Review asserting that autonomy has been historically a demand of the Santa Cruz region, \\"contemporarily imbued with far-right, populist sentiments.\\" They also qualified Santa Cruz autonomy as a \\"bourgeois ideology\\" of the \\"free market, foreign investment, racism, etc.\\", which pits the \\"modern\\", \\"whiter\\" Santa Cruz elite against the short, dark-skinned and anti-capitalist Aymara and Quechua peoples of the western region of Bolivia.\\"Left-Indigenous Struggles in Bolivia: Searching for Revolutionary Democracy\\", by Jeffery R. Webber, Monthly Review September 2005 =Dispute over pipeline route= The dispute arose in early 2002, when the administration of President Jorge Quiroga proposed building the pipeline through neighboring Chile to the port of Mejillones, the most direct route to the Pacific Ocean. However, antagonism towards Chile runs deep in Bolivia because of the loss of Bolivia's Pacific coastline to Chile in the War of the Pacific (1879‚Äì1884). Bolivians began campaigning against the Chilean option, arguing instead that the pipeline should be routed north through the Peruvian port of Ilo, 260 km further from the gas fields than Mejillones, or, better yet, first industrialized in Bolivia. According to Chilean estimates, the Mejillones option would be $600 million cheaper. Peru, however, claimed the difference in cost would be no more than $300 million. Bolivian proponents of the Peruvian option say it would also benefit the economy of the northern region of Bolivia through which the pipeline would pass. Supporters of the Chile pipeline argued that U.S. financiers would be unlikely to develop processing facilities within Bolivia. Meanwhile, the Peruvian government, eager to promote territorial and economic integration, offered Bolivia a special economic zone for 99 years for exporting the gas at Ilo, the right of free passage, and the concession of a 10 km¬≤ area, including a port, that would be exclusively under Bolivian administration. President Jorge Quiroga postponed the decision shortly before leaving office in July 2002 and left this highly contentious issue to his successor. It was thought Quiroga did not want to jeopardize his chances of re-election as president in the 2007 elections. After winning the 2002 presidential election Gonzalo S√°nchez de Lozada expressed his preference for the Mejillones option but made no \\"official\\" decision. The Gas War led to his resignation in October 2003. =Escalation= 2003 Poster for a photo exhibition of the gas war The social conflict escalated in September 2003 with protests and road blockages paralyzing large parts of the country, leading to increasingly violent confrontations with the Bolivian armed forces. The insurrection was spearheaded by Bolivia's indigenous majority, who accused S√°nchez de Lozada of pandering to the US government's \\"war on drugs\\" and blamed him for failing to improve living standards in Bolivia. On September 8,650 Aymaras started a hunger strike to protest against the state detention of a villager. The man detained was one of the heads of the village, and was imprisoned for having sentenced to the death penalty two young men in a \\"community justice\\" trial. On September 19, the National Coordination for the Defense of Gas mobilized 30,000 people in Cochabamba and 50,000 in La Paz to demonstrate against the pipeline. The following day six Aymara villagers, including an eight-year-old girl, were killed in a confrontation in the town of Warisata. Government forces used planes and helicopters to circumvent the strikers and evacuate several hundred foreign and Bolivian tourists from Sorata who had been stranded by the road blockades for five days. In response to the shootings, Bolivia's Labor Union (COB) called a general strike on September 29 that paralyzed the country with road closures. Union leaders insisted they would continue until the government backed down on its decision. Poorly armed Aymara community militias drove the army and police out of Warisata and the towns of Sorata and Achacachi, equipped only with traditional Aymara sling shots and guns from the 1952 Bolivian National Revolution. Eugenio Rojas, leader of the regional strike committee, declared that if the government refused to negotiate in Warisata, then the insurgent Aymara communities would surround La Paz and cut it off from the rest of the country ‚Äî a tactic employed in the T√∫paj Katari uprising of 1781. Felipe Quispe, leader of the Indigenous Pachakuti Movement (MIP), stated that he would not participate in dialogue with the government until the military withdrew from blockaded areas. The government refused to negotiate with Quispe, claiming that he did not have the authority to represent the campesino movement. As the protests continued, protesters in El Alto, a sprawling indigenous city of 750,000 people on the periphery of La Paz, proceeded to block key access routes to the capital causing severe fuel and food shortages. They also demanded the resignation of S√°nchez de Lozada and his ministers, Yerko Kukoc, Minister of Government, and Carlos S√°nchez de Berza√≠n, Minister of Defense, who were held responsible for the Warisata massacre. Protesters also voiced their opposition to the Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement that was at the time under negotiation by the US and Latin American countries (since the November 2005 Mar del Plata Summit of the Americas, it has been put on stand- by). Martial law in El Alto On October 12, 2003 the government imposed martial law in El Alto after sixteen people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes which erupted when a caravan of oil trucks escorted by police and soldiers deploying tanks and heavy-caliber machine guns tried to breach a barricade. On October 13, the administration of S√°nchez de Lozada suspended the gas project \\"until consultations have been conducted [with the Bolivian people].\\" However, Vice President Carlos Mesa deplored what he referred to as the \\"excessive force\\" used in El Alto (80 dead) and withdrew his support for S√°nchez de Lozada. The Minister of Economic Development, Jorge Torrez, of the MIR party, also resigned. The United States Department of State issued a statement on October 13 declaring its support for S√°nchez de Lozada, calling for \\"Bolivia's political leaders [to] publicly express their support for democratic and constitutional order. The international community and the United States will not tolerate any interruption of constitutional order and will not support any regime that results from undemocratic means\\". On October 18, S√°nchez de Lozada's governing coalition was fatally weakened when the New Republic Force party withdrew its support. He was forced to resign and was replaced by his vice president, Carlos Mesa, a former journalist. The strikes and roadblocks were lifted. Mesa promised that no civilians would be killed by police or army forces during his presidency. Despite dramatic unrest during his time in office, he respected this promise. Among his first actions as president, Mesa promised a referendum on the gas issue and appointed several indigenous people to cabinet posts. On July 18, 2004, Mesa put the issue of gas nationalization to a referendum. On May 6, 2005, the Bolivian Congress passed a new law raising taxes from 18% to 32% on profits made by foreign companies on the extraction of oil and gas. Mesa failed to either sign or veto the law, so by law Senate President Hormando Vaca Diez was required to sign it into law on May 17. Many protesters felt this law was inadequate and demanded full nationalization of the gas and oil industry.  The 2005 Hydrocarbons Law  On May 6, 2005 the long-awaited Hydrocarbons Law was finally approved by the Bolivian Congress. On May 17 Mesa again refused to either sign or veto the controversial law, thus constitutionally requiring Senate President Hormando Vaca D√≠ez to sign the measure and put it into effect. The new law returned legal ownership to the state of all hydrocarbons and natural resources, maintained royalties at 18 percent, but increased taxes from 16 to 32 percent. It gave the government control of the commercialization of the resources and allowed for continuous government control with annual audits. It also ordered companies to consult with indigenous groups who live on land containing gas deposits. The law stated that the 76 contracts signed by foreign firms must be renegotiated before 180 days. This has not yet been done. Protesters argued that the new law did not go far enough to protect the natural resources from exploitation by foreign corporations, demanding a complete nationalization of the gas and process in Bolivia. Due to the uncertainty over renegotiation of contracts, foreign firms have practically stopped investing in the gas sector. Foreign investment virtually came to a standstill in the second half of 2005. Shortages in supply ‚Äì very similar to those observed in Argentina after the 2001 price-fixing ‚Äì are deepening in diesel, LPG, and begin to be apparent in natural gas. The May‚ÄìJune social unrest affected the supply of hydrocarbons products to the internal market, principally LPG and natural gas to the occidental region. Brazil implemented a contingency plan ‚Äì led by the Energy and Mines Minister ‚Äì to mitigate any potential impact from gas export curtailment. Although the supply was never curtailed, the social unrest in Bolivia created a strong sensation that security of supply could not be guaranteed. Occasional social action has continued to affect the continuity of supply, especially valve-closing actions.  Carlos Mesa's June 2005 resignation  = The protests = Over 80,000 people participated in the May 2005 protests. Tens of thousands of people each day walked from El Alto to the capital La Paz, where protesters effectively shut down the city, bringing transportation to a halt through strikes and blockades, and engaging in street battles with police. The protestors demanded the nationalisation of the gas industry and reforms to give more power to the indigenous majority, who were mainly Aymaras from the impoverished highlands. They were pushed back by the police with tear gas and rubber bullets, while many of the miners involved in the protests came armed with dynamite. May 24, 2005 More than 10,000 Aymara peasant farmers from the twenty highland provinces came down from El Alto's Ceja neighborhood into La Paz to protest. On May 31, 2005 residents of El Alto and the Aymara peasant farmers returned to La Paz. More than 50,000 people covered an area of nearly 100 square kilometers. The next day, the first regiment of the National Police decided, by consensus, not to repress the protests and were internally reprimanded by the government. On June 2, as the protests raged on, President Mesa announced two measures, designed to placate the indigenous protesters on the one hand and the Santa Cruz autonomy movement on the other: elections for a new constitutional assembly and a referendum on regional autonomy, both set for October 16. However, both sides rejected Mesa's call: the Pro-Santa Cruz Civic Committee declared its own referendum on autonomy for August 12, while in El Alto protesters began to cut off gasoline to La Paz. Approximately half a million people mobilized in the streets of La Paz, on June 6, and President Mesa subsequently offered his resignation. Riot police used tear gas as miners amongst the demonstrators traditionally set off dynamite in clashes near the presidential palace, while a strike brought traffic to a standstill. However, Congress failed to meet for several days owing to the \\"insecurity\\" of meeting as protests raged nearby. Many members of Congress found themselves unable to physically attend the sessions. Senate President Hormando Vaca D√≠ez decided to move the sessions to Bolivia's alternate capital, Sucre, in an attempt to avoid the protesters. Radical farmers occupied oil wells owned by transnational companies, and blockaded border crossings. Mesa ordered the military to airlift food to La Paz, which remained totally blockaded. Vaca Diez and House of Delegates president, Mario Coss√≠o, were the two next in the line of succession to become President. However, they were strongly disliked by the protesters, and each declared they would not accept succession to the Presidency, finally promoting Edwardo Rodriguez, Supreme Court Chief Justice, to the Presidency. Considered apolitical and hence trustworthy by most, his administration was a temporary one until elections could be held. Protesters quickly disbanded in many areas, and like many times in Bolivia's past, major political upheavals were taken as a normal part of the political process. Caretaker President Rodriguez proceeded to implement the Hydrocarbons Law. The new tax IDH has been levied from the companies that are paying 'under reserve'. A number of upstream gas companies have invoked Bilateral Investment Protection Treaties and entered the conciliation phase with the state of Bolivia. The treaties are a step towards a court hearing before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), dependent of the World Bank, which could force Bolivia to pay indemnities to the companies.  Concerns of possible US intervention  A military training agreement with Asunci√≥n (Paraguay), giving immunity to US soldiers, caused some concern after media reports initially reported that a base housing 20,000 US soldiers was being built at Mariscal Estigarribia within 200 km of Argentina and Bolivia, and 300 km of Brazil, near an airport which could receive large planes (B-52, C-130 Hercules, etc.) which the Paraguayan Air Forces do not have.US Marines put a foot in Paraguay, El Clar√≠n, September 9, 2005 According to the Clar√≠n, an Argentinian newspaper, the US military base is strategic because of its location near the Triple Frontera between Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina; its proximity to the Guarani aquifer; and, finally, its proximity to Bolivia (less than 200 km) at the same \\"moment that Washington's magnifying glass goes on the Altiplano and points toward Venezuelan Hugo Ch√°vez ‚Äî the regional demon according to Bush's administration ‚Äî as the instigator of the instability in the region\\" (Clar√≠n). Later reports indicated that 400 US troops would be deployed in Paraguay over 18 months for training and humanitarian missions consisting of 13 detachments numbering less than 50 personnel each. The Paraguayan administration as well as Bush's administration denied that the airport would be used as a US military base, or that there would be any other US base in Paraguay.The President of Paraguay similar statements link MexicoFurther clarifications were made by US Embassy in Paraguay in July 2005 link US-Embassy-Paraguay , and repeated by other sources \\"Generally between 10 to 20 people, will train with their Paraguayan military colleagues during periods of two to six weeks....The American soldiers will not be deployed for extensive periods of time, and there will never be but a few dozen soldiers in Paraguay for no more than 45 days...The exercises will end by December 2006.\\"  Other countries  The social conflicts of the last few years have paralyzed Bolivia's political life. The unpopularity of the neoliberal Washington consensus, a set of economic strategies implemented by Gonzalo de Lozada's administration, set the stage for the 2006 election of president Evo Morales, the country's first indigenous president. In the meantime, Chile promptly started to build several coastal terminals to receive shipments of liquefied natural gas from Malaysia Thailand Indonesia, Australia Turkey South Korea Norway Kenya Japan China Libya and other sources. Other South American countries are contemplating other ways to secure gas supplies: one project aims at linking the Camisea gas reserves in Peru to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay. Linking Pisco (south of Peru) to Tocopilla (north of Chile) with a 1200 km pipeline would cost $2 billion. However, experts doubt the Camisea reserves are enough for all the Southern Cone countries. Another 8,000 km gas pipeline (Gran Gasoducto del Sur) has been proposed that would link Venezuela to Argentina via Brazil. Its cost is estimated between $8 and $12 billion. While Argentina and Chile are large consumers of gas (50 percent and 25 percent respectively), other South American countries are a lot less dependent.  Nationalization of natural gas industry  On May 1, 2006 president Evo Morales signed a decree stating that all gas reserves were to be nationalized: \\"the state recovers ownership, possession and total and absolute control\\" of hydrocarbons. He thus realized his electoral promises, declaring that \\"We are not a government of mere promises: we follow through on what we propose and what the people demand\\". The announcement was timed to coincide with Labor Day on May 1. Ordering the military and engineers of YPFB, the state firm, to occupy and secure energy installations, he gave foreign companies a six-month \\"transition period\\" to re-negotiate contracts, or face expulsion. Nevertheless, president Morales stated that the nationalization would not take the form of expropriations or confiscations. Vice President √Ålvaro Garc√≠a said in La Paz's main plaza that the government's energy-related revenue will jump to $780 million next year, expanding nearly sixfold from 2002. Among the 53 installations affected by the measure are those of Brazil's Petrobras, one of Bolivia's largest investors, which controls 14% of the country's gas reserves. Brazil's Energy Minister, Silas Rondeau, reacted by considering the move as \\"unfriendly\\" and contrary to previous understandings between his country and Bolivia. Petrobras, Spain's Repsol YPF, UK gas and oil producer BG Group Plc and France's Total are the main gas companies present in the country. According to Reuters, \\"Bolivia's actions echo what Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez, a Morales ally, did in the world's fifth-largest oil exporter with forced contract migrations and retroactive tax hikes ‚Äî conditions that oil majors largely agreed to accept.\\" YPFB would pay foreign companies for their services, offering about 50 percent of the value of production, although the decree indicated that companies at the country's two largest gas fields would get just 18 percent. Negotiations between the Bolivian government and the foreign companies intensified during the week leading up to the deadline of Saturday October 28, 2006. On Friday an agreement was reached with two of the companies (including Total) and by the deadline on Saturday the rest of the ten companies (including Petrobras and Repsol YPF) operating in Bolivia had also come to an agreement. Full details of the new contracts have not been released, but the objective of raising government share of revenues from the two major fields from 60 percent to 82 percent seems to have been achieved. Revenue share for the government from minor fields is set at 60 percent. During the six month negotiation period talks with the Brazilian company Petrobras had proven especially difficult. Petrobras had refused raises or reduction to a mere service provider. As a result of stalled talks Bolivian energy minister Andres Soliz Rada resigned in October and was replaced by Carlos Villegas. \\"We are obligated to live with Brazil in a marriage without divorce, because we both need each other\\", said Evo Morales in the contract signing ceremony underlining the mutual dependency of Brazil on Bolivian gas and of Bolivia on Petrobras in gas production. =Reaction= On December 15, 2007 the regions of Santa Cruz, Tarija, Beni, and Pando declared autonomy from the central government. They also moved to achieve full independence from Bolivia's new constitution.  The Protesters  = Miners = Miners from the Bolivian trade union Central Obrera Boliviana (COB) have also been very active in the recent protests. Recently they have been active against propositions to privatize pensions. They have been known for letting off very loud explosions of dynamite in the recent protests. = Coca farmers = Shortly after the law passed, Evo Morales, an Aymara Indian, cocalero, and leader of the opposition party Movement Towards Socialism (MAS), took a moderate position calling the new law \\"middle ground\\". However, as the protests progressed, Morales has come out in favor of nationalization and new elections. = Protesters in Cochabamba = Oscar Olivera was a prominent leader in the 2001 protests in Cochabamba against the privatization of water in Bolivia and has also become a leading figure. Specifically the protesters in Cochabamba, Bolivia's fourth largest city, have cut off the main roads in the city and are calling for a new Constituent Assembly as well as nationalization. = Indigenous and peasant groups in Santa Cruz = Indians in the eastern lowland department of Santa Cruz have also become active in the recent disputes over nationalization of the gas and oil industry. They are composed of indigenous groups such as the Guaran√≠, Ayoreo, Chiquitano and the Guyarayos, as opposed to the highland Indians (Aymara and Quechua). They have been active in recent land disputes and the main organization representing this faction is known as the \\"Confederacion de pueblos indigenas de Bolivia\\" (CIDOB). The CIDOB after initially offering support to MAS, the party of Bolivia's new president, have come to believe that they were deceived by the Bolivian government. The MAS, which is based in the highlands, is no more willing to grant them voice than the previous governments whose power was also based from the highlands. Another smaller more radical group called the \\"Landless Peasant Movement\\" (MST) which is somewhat similar to the Landless Workers' Movement in Brazil, and is composed mainly of immigrants from the western part of the country. Recently, Guaran√≠ Indians from this group have taken oil fields run by Spain's Repsol YPF and the United Kingdom's BP and have forced them to stop production. = Felipe Quispe and peasant farmers = Felipe Quispe is a radical Aymara leader who wishes to return control of the country from what he sees as the \\"white elite\\" to the indigenous Aymaran people who make up the majority of the country's population. Therefore, he is in favor of an independent \\"Aymaran state\\".

The ankle includes three joints: the ankle joint proper or talocrural joint, the subtalar joint, and the inferior tibiofibular joint. The movements produced at this joint are dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot. In common usage, the term ankle refers exclusively to the ankle region. In medical terminology, \\"ankle\\" (without qualifiers) can refer broadly to the region or specifically to the talocrural joint. The main bones of the ankle region are the talus (in the foot), and the tibia and fibula (in the leg). The talocrural joint is a synovial hinge joint that connects the distal ends of the tibia and fibula in the lower limb with the proximal end of the talus. The articulation between the tibia and the talus bears more weight than that between the smaller fibula and the talus. Structure =Region= As a region, the ankle is found at the junction of the leg and the foot. It extends downwards (distally) from the narrowest point of the lower leg and includes the parts of the foot closer to the body (proximal) to the heel and upper surface (dorsum) of the foot. =Ankle joint= The talocrural joint is the only mortise and tenon joint in the human body, the term likening the skeletal structure to the woodworking joint of the same name. The bony architecture of the ankle consists of three bones: the tibia, the fibula, and the talus. The articular surface of the tibia may be referred to as the plafond (French for \\"ceiling\\"). The medial malleolus is a bony process extending distally off the medial tibia. The distal-most aspect of the fibula is called the lateral malleolus. Together, the malleoli, along with their supporting ligaments, stabilize the talus underneath the tibia. Because the motion of the subtalar joint provides a significant contribution to positioning the foot, some authors will describe it as the lower ankle joint, and call the talocrural joint the upper ankle joint. Dorsiflexion and Plantarflexion are the movements that take place in the ankle joint. When the foot is plantar flexed, the ankle joint also allows some movements of side to side gliding, rotation, adduction, and abduction. The bony arch formed by the tibial plafond and the two malleoli is referred to as the ankle \\"mortise\\" (or talar mortise). The mortise is a rectangular socket. The ankle is composed of three joints: the talocrural joint (also called talotibial joint, tibiotalar joint, talar mortise, talar joint), the subtalar joint (also called talocalcaneal), and the Inferior tibiofibular joint. The joint surface of all bones in the ankle are covered with articular cartilage. The distances between the bones in the ankle are as follows: *Talus - medial malleolus : 1.70 ¬± 0.13 mm *Talus - tibial plafond: 2.04 ¬± 0.29 mm *Talus - lateral malleolus: 2.13 ¬± 0.20 mm Decreased distances indicate osteoarthritis. =Ligaments= The ankle joint is bound by the strong deltoid ligament and three lateral ligaments: the anterior talofibular ligament, the posterior talofibular ligament, and the calcaneofibular ligament. * The deltoid ligament supports the medial side of the joint, and is attached at the medial malleolus of the tibia and connect in four places to the talar shelf of the calcaneus, calcaneonavicular ligament, the navicular tuberosity, and to the medial surface of the talus. * The anterior and posterior talofibular ligaments support the lateral side of the joint from the lateral malleolus of the fibula to the dorsal and ventral ends of the talus. * The calcaneofibular ligament is attached at the lateral malleolus and to the lateral surface of the calcaneus. Though it does not span the ankle joint itself, the syndesmotic ligament makes an important contribution to the stability of the ankle. This ligament spans the syndesmosis, i.e. the articulation between the medial aspect of the distal fibula and the lateral aspect of the distal tibia. An isolated injury to this ligament is often called a high ankle sprain. The bony architecture of the ankle joint is most stable in dorsiflexion. Thus, a sprained ankle is more likely to occur when the ankle is plantar-flexed, as ligamentous support is more important in this position. The classic ankle sprain involves the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL), which is also the most commonly injured ligament during inversion sprains. Another ligament that can be injured in a severe ankle sprain is the calcaneofibular ligament. =Retinacula, tendons and their synovial sheaths, vessels, and nerves= A number of tendons pass through the ankle region. Bands of connective tissue called retinacula (singular: retinaculum) allow the tendons to exert force across the angle between the leg and foot without lifting away from the angle, a process called bowstringing. The superior extensor retinaculum of foot extends between the anterior (forward) surfaces of the tibia and fibula near their lower (distal) ends. It contains the anterior tibial artery and vein and the tendons of the tibialis anterior muscle within its tendon sheath and the unsheathed tendons of extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum longus muscles. The deep peroneal nerve passes under the retinaculum while the superficial peroneal nerve is outside of it. The inferior extensor retinaculum of foot is a Y-shaped structure. Its lateral attachment is on the calcaneus, and the band travels towards the anterior tibia where it is attached and blends with the superior extensor retinaculum. Along with that course, the band divides and another segment attaches to the plantar aponeurosis. The tendons which pass through the superior extensor retinaculum are all sheathed along their paths through the inferior extensor retinaculum and the tendon of the fibularis tertius muscle is also contained within the retinaculum. The flexor retinaculum of foot extends from the medial malleolus to the medical process of the calcaneus, and the following structures in order from medial to lateral: the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle, the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus muscle, the posterior tibial artery and vein, the tibial nerve, and the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus muscle. The fibular retinacula hold the tendons of the fibularis longus and fibularis brevis along the lateral aspect of the ankle region. The superior fibular retinaculum extends from the deep transverse fascia of the leg and lateral malleolus to calcaneus. The inferior fibular retinaculum is a continuous extension from the inferior extensor retinaculum to the calcaneus. =Mechanoreceptors= Mechanoreceptors of the ankle send proprioceptive sensory input to the central nervous system (CNS). Muscle spindles are thought to be the main type of mechanoreceptor responsible for proprioceptive attributes from the ankle. The muscle spindle gives feedback to the CNS system on the current length of the muscle it innervates and to any change in length that occurs. It was hypothesized that muscle spindle feedback from the ankle dorsiflexors played the most substantial role in proprioception relative to other muscular receptors that cross at the ankle joint. However, due to the multi-planar range of motion at the ankle joint there is not one group of muscles that is responsible for this. This helps to explain the relationship between the ankle and balance. In 2011, a relationship between proprioception of the ankle and balance performance was seen in the CNS. This was done by using a fMRI machine in order to see the changes in brain activity when the receptors of the ankle are stimulated. This implicates the ankle directly with the ability to balance. Further research is needed in order to see to what extent does the ankle affect balance. Function Historically, the role of the ankle in locomotion has been discussed by Aristotle and Leonardo da Vinci. There is no question that ankle push-off is a significant force in human gait, but how much energy is used in leg swing as opposed to advancing the whole-body center of mass is not clear. Clinical significance A diagram illustrating varying severity of ankle sprain =Traumatic injury= Of all major joints, the ankle is the most commonly injured. If the outside surface of the foot is twisted under the leg during weight bearing, the lateral ligament, especially the anterior talofibular portion, is subject to tearing (a sprain) as it is weaker than the medial ligament and it resists inward rotation of the talocrural joint. Fractures Symptoms of an ankle fracture can be similar to those of ankle sprains (pain), though typically they are often more severe by comparison. It is exceedingly rare for the ankle joint to dislocate in the presence of ligamentous injury alone. The talus is most commonly fractured by two methods. The first is hyperdorsiflexion, where the neck of the talus is forced against the tibia and fractures. The second is jumping from a height - the body is fractured as the talus transmits the force from the foot to the lower limb bones.http://teachmeanatomy.info/the-ankle-joint/ In the setting of an ankle fracture the talus can become unstable and subluxate or dislocate. People may complain of ecchymosis (bruising), or there may be an abnormal position, abnormal motion, or lack of motion. Diagnosis is typically by X-ray. Treatment is either via surgery or casting depending on the fracture types. =Imaging= The initial evaluation of suspected ankle pathology is usually by projectional radiography (\\"X-ray\\"). Tibiotalar surface angle (TTS) Varus or valgus deformity, if suspected, can be measured with the frontal tibiotalar surface angle (TTS), formed by the mid-longitudinal tibial axis (such as through a line bisecting the tibia at 8 and 13 cm above the tibial plafond) and the talar surface. An angle of less than 84 degrees is regarded as talipes varus, and an angle of more than 94 degrees is regarded as talipes valgus.Chapter 5 - Radiological morphology of peritalar instability in varus and valgus tilted ankles, in: For ligamentous injury, there are 3 main landmarks on X-rays: The first is the tibiofibular clear space, the horizontal distance from the lateral border of the posterior tibial malleolus to the medial border of the fibula, with greater than 5 mm being abnormal. The second is tibiofibular overlap, the horizontal distance between the medial border of the fibula and the lateral border of the anterior tibial prominence, with less than 10 mm being abnormal. The final measurement is the medial clear space, the distance between the lateral aspect of the medial malleolus and the medial border of the talus at the level of the talar dome, with a measurement greater than 4 mm being abnormal. Loss of any of these normal anatomic spaces can indirectly reflect ligamentous injury or occult fracture, and can be followed by MRI or CT. =Abnormalities= Clubfoot or talipes equinovarus, which occurs in one to two of every 1,000 live births, involves multiple abnormalities of the foot. Equinus refers to the downard deflection of the ankle, and is named for the walking on the toes in the manner of a horse. This does not occur because it is accompanied by an inward rotation of the foot (varus deformity), which untreated, results in walking on the sides of the feet. Treatment may involve manipulation and casting or surgery. Occasionally a human ankle has a ball-and-socket ankle joint and fusion of the talo- navicular joint. History The word ankle or ancle is common, in various forms, to Germanic languages, probably connected in origin with the Latin , or Greek , meaning bent. Other animals =Evolution= It has been suggested that dexterous control of toes has been lost in favour of a more precise voluntary control of the ankle joint.

The Great Goddess of Teotihuacan (or Teotihuacan Spider Woman) is a proposed goddess of the pre-Columbian Teotihuacan civilization (ca. 100 BCE - 700 CE), in what is now Mexico. Discovery and interpretation In years leading up to 1942, a series of murals were found in the Tepantitla compound in Teotihuacan. The Tepantitla compound provided housing for what appears to have been high status citizens and its walls (as well as much of Teotihuacan) are adorned with brightly painted frescoes. The largest figures within the murals depicted complex and ornate deities or supernaturals. In 1942, archaeologist Alfonso Caso identified these central figures as a Teotihuacan equivalent of Tlaloc, the Mesoamerican god of rain and warfare. This was the consensus view for some 30 years. In 1974, Peter Furst suggested that the murals instead showed a feminine deity, an interpretation echoed by researcher Esther Pasztory. Their analysis of the murals was based on a number of factors including the gender of accompanying figures, the green bird in the headdress, and the spiders seen above the figure.Pasztory (1977), pp. 83‚Äì85. Pasztory concluded that the figures represented a vegetation and fertility goddess that was a predecessor of the much later Aztec goddess Xochiquetzal. In 1983, Karl Taube termed this goddess the \\"Teotihuacan Spider Woman\\". The more neutral description of this deity as the \\"Great Goddess\\" has since gained currency. The Great Goddess has since been identified at Teotihuacan locations other than Tepantitla ‚Äì including the Tetitla compound (see photo below), the Palace of the Jaguars, and the Temple of Agriculture ‚Äì as well as on portable art including vesselsPasztory (1977), pp.87‚Äì91. and even on the back of a pyrite mirror.Berlo (1992), p. 145. This mirror back is presently in the Cleveland Museum of Art and can be seen here. The 3-metre-high blocky statue (see photo below) which formerly sat near the base of the Pyramid of Moon is thought to represent the Great Goddess,Headrick (2002). Berlo (1992), p. 137. despite the absence of the bird-headdress or the fanged nosepiece.The absence of the bird- headdress and the fanged nosepiece is noted in Cowgill (1997), p. 149. Esther Pasztory speculates that the Great Goddess, as a distant and ambivalent mother figure, was able to provide a uniting structure for Teotihuacan that transcended divisions within the city.Pasztory (1993), p. 61-62. Mural from the Tepantitla compound showing what has been identified as an aspect of the Great Goddess of Teotihuacan, from a reproduction in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. =After Teotihuacan= The Great Goddess is apparently peculiar to Teotihuacan, and does not appear outside the city except where Teotihuacanos settled.Pasztory (1993), p. 56-57. There is very little trace of the Great Goddess in the Valley of Mexico's later Toltec culture, although an earth goddess image has been identified on Stela 1, from Xochicalco, a Toltec contemporary.Berlo, p. 154. While the Aztec goddess Chalchiuhtlicue has been identified as a successor to the Great Goddess of Teotihuacan, archaeologist Janet Catherine Berlo has suggested that at least the Goddess' warlike aspect was assumed by the Aztec's protector god ‚Äì and war god ‚Äì Huitzilopochtli. The wresting of this aspect from the Great Goddess was memorialized in the myth Huitzilopochtli, who slew his sister Coyolxauhqui shortly after his birth.Berlo, p. 152. Berlo also sees echoes of the Great Goddess in the veneration of the Virgin of Guadalupe.Berlo, p. 154. The Great Goddess Defining characteristics of the Great Goddess are a bird headress and a nose pendant with descending fangs.Cowgill, p. 149. Headrick (2007), p. 33. In the Tepantitla and Tetitla murals, for example, the Great Goddess wears a frame headdress that includes the face of a green bird, generally identified as an owl or quetzal,Pasztory (1977), p.87. and a rectangular nosepiece adorned with three circles below which hang three or five fangs. The outer fangs curl away from the center, while the middle fang points down. She is also always seen with jewelry such as beaded necklaces and earrings which were commonly worn by Teotihuacan women. Her face is always shown frontally, either masked or partially covered, and her hands in murals are always depicted stretched out giving water, seeds, and jade treasures. Other defining characteristics include the colors red and yellow;Berlo, p. 140. note that the Goddess appears with a yellowish cast in both murals. In the depiction from the Tepantitla compound, the Great Goddess appears with vegetation growing out of her head, perhaps hallucinogenic morning glory vinesFurst (1974). or the world tree.Headrick (2002), p. 86. Headrick (2007). See also course notes by Kappelman (2002). Note, however, that there appear to be two separate and differently colored trees, one with spiders and one with butterflies. Spiders and butterflies appear on the vegetation and water drips from its branches and flows from the hands of the Great Goddess. Water also flows from her lower body. These many representations of water led Caso to declare this to be a representation of the rain god, Tlaloc. Below this depiction, separated from it by two interwoven serpents and a talud-tablero, is a scene showing dozens of small human figures, usually wearing only a loincloth and often showing a speech scroll (see photo below). Several of these figures are swimming in the criss-crossed rivers flowing from a mountain at the bottom of the scene. Caso interpreted this scene as the afterlife realm of Tlaloc, although this interpretation has also been challenged, most recently by Mar√≠a Teresa Uriarte, who provides a more commonplace interpretation: that \\"this mural represents Teotihuacan as [the] prototypical civilized city associated with the beginning of time and the calendar\\".Uriarte (2006, abstract). Note that Uriarte's description gibes with Pasztory's assessment of a Teotihuacan culture dedicated to the creation of paradise on earth. A portion of the actual mural from the Tepantitla compound which appears under the Great Goddess portrait. Domain The Great Goddess is thought to have been a goddess of the underworld, darkness, the earth, water, war, and possibly even creation itself. To the ancient civilizations of Mesoamerica, the jaguar, the owl, and especially the spider were considered creatures of darkness, often found in caves and during the night. The fact that the Great Goddess is frequently depicted with all of these creatures further supports the idea of her underworld connections. In many murals, the Great Goddess is shown with many of the scurrying arachnids in the background, on her clothing, or hanging from her arms. She is often seen with shields decorated with spider webs, further suggesting her relationship with warfare. The Great Goddess is often shown in paradisial settings, giving gifts.Pasztory (1993), p. 61. For example, the mural from Tepantitla shows water dripping from her hands while in the tableau under her portrait mortals swim, play ball, and dance (see photo to right). This seeming gentleness is in contrast to later similar Aztec deities such as Cihuacoatl, who frequently has a warlike aspect.Miller & Taube, p. 61. This contrast, according to Esther Pasztory, an archaeologist who has long studied Teotihuacan, extends beyond the goddesses in question to the core of the Teotihuacan and Aztec cultures themselves: :\\"Although I cannot prove this precisely, I sense that the Aztec goal was military glory and staving off the collapse of the universe, whereas the Teotihuacan aim seems to have been the creation of paradise on earth.\\"Pasztory (1993), p. 49. This is not to say, however, that the Great Goddess does not have her more violent aspect: one mural fragment, likely from Techinantitla, shows her as a large mouth with teeth, framed by clawed hands.Berrin & Pasztory, p. 195. Other interpretations = Mixed-Gender Interpretation = Elisa C. Mandell's 2015 article \\"A New Analysis of the Gender Attribution of the 'Great Goddess' of Teotihuacan\\" published by Cambridge challenges the interpretation of the Great Goddess as being not only female but also male, a mixed-gender figure. Sex is understood as the biological and anatomical difference between men and women, while gender is a socially and culturally constructed identity. There are disagreements among historians over the role of biology to informing gender and ‚Äúwhether sex as a biological concept exists outside Western society‚Äù. There is a history of mixed-gender identity within Mesoamerican people, and considering that the Goddess is from Teotihuacan, Western models of gender binary should not be imposed upon non-Western figures. Additionally, there are no explicit sexual characteristics shown on the Great Goddess so their sex cannot be deduced. There is a history of masculine and feminine attributes being shown within the same figure in Mesoamerican art. The Mayan Maize Deity can be seen as an example of this, as posited by Bassie-Sweet. Considering the importance of maize, or corn, which has the ability to switch between the two biological sexes. With the fact that Mesoamerican people considered themselves to be descendants of the corn plant, this nature based culture allows for ambiguity of sex and gender within the peoplesBassie-Sweet, Karen 2002 Corn Deities and the Male/Female Principle. In Ancient Maya Gender Identity and Relations, edited by Gustafson, Lowell S.and Trevelyan, Amelia M., pp. 169‚Äì190. Bergin and Garvey, Westport, CT.. Furthermore, we have evidence that the Maize God inspired Mayan elites, no matter their gender, to wear mixed-gender costumes to honor the Maize GodF. Kent Reilly 2002 Female and Male: The Ideology of Balance and Renewal in Elite Costuming Among the Classic Period Maya. In Ancient Maya Gender Identity and Relations, edited by Lowell S.Gustafson and Amelia M.Trevelyan, pp. 319‚Äì328. Bergin and Garvey, Westport, CT.. Mandell's article analyzes and reattributes each element included in the Goddesses depiction in the Tepantitla and Tetitla murals, reconsidering previous gendering of these elements. Pasztory references the three main elements of the Goddess: the avian headdress, the yellow and red zig-zags, and the nosebarEsther Pasztory 1992b Abstraction and the Rise of a Utopian State at Teotihuacan. In Art, Ideology, and the City of Teotihuacan, edited by Janet C.Berlo, pp. 281‚Äì320. Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, DC.. Mandell references many depictions of male and female deities where these elements are including, suggesting that it is impossible to determine any specific gendering from the headdress, zig-zags, and nosebar. Mandell then suggests that the mixture of these male and female attributes suggests that the Goddess is mixed-gender. More generally, many images have been understood as depicting the Goddess because of their inclusion of water, which is also understood as a feminine symbol. Mandell posits that there is nothing inherently feminine about this liquid. In the Tepantitla and Tetitla murals, the water is filled with seed and shell shaped object. Liquid with sea-life and sperm may represent semen made up of sperm, thus suggesting a masculine association. One of the reasons Pasztory had asserted that the Goddess was a feminine deity is because it was understood to be wearing a quechquemitl. The quechquemitl is often associated with female figures. However, the triangular shirt or cape had multiple meanings for different people that also changed over time, and therefore it cannot be used as a simple demarcation of a figure‚Äôs sex or gender. Similarly, the Goddess‚Äô ear ornaments had been a factor in deciphering the deity as feminine. Mandell asserts that there is no conclusive evidence to support these ornaments as feminine, and rather this particular ear ornament has been seen on male and female gods. The short skirt seen worn by figures in the Tepantitla mural has been considered another attribute of femininity, yet in Teotihuacan it was more common for males to be depicted in short kilts. The profile figures in the Tepantitla mural carry small bags, which men are known to carry, as seen in depictions of priests in Maya art. Mandell asserts that the ambiguity and combination of masculine and feminine attributes should be seen as a mixed-gender performance, not subjected to the Western binary model of gender. = Various Interpretations within the Archaeological Community = * In a 2006 article in Ancient Mesoamerica, Zolt√°n Paulinyi argues that the Great Goddess or Spider Woman is \\"highly speculative\\" and is a result of fusing up to six unrelated gods and goddesses. * In \\"The Olmec Mountain and Tree Creation in Mesoamerican Cosmology\\", Linda Schele states that the primary mural represents \\"either a Teotihuacan ruler or the Great Goddess\\".Schele (1996), p.111, fig. 20. See also this synopsis. * In her 2007 book, The Teotihuacan Trinity, Anna Headrick is cautious in identifying the murals as portraits of the Great Goddess, preferring the term \\"mountain-tree\\". Headrick identifies the tree which sprouts from the headdress as the Mesoamerican world tree.Headrick (2007), p. 141. This statue is generally identified as the Great Goddess, and formerly stood near the base of the Pyramid of the Moon.Headrick, Annabeth (2002), p. 86. Headrick (2007), p. 33. Similar deities Some American Indians, such as the Pueblo and Navajo, revered what seems to be a similar deity. Referred to as the Spider Grandmother, she shares many traits with the Teotihuacan Spider Woman.

Six works from 1934 are listed, compositions which \\"were completed (or nearly completed), but never formally performed. ... All manuscripts are at Duke University.\\" at a time he was attending John Adams High School, from which he graduated in 1935. After that, Ward attended the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, where his composition teachers were Bernard Rogers, Howard Hanson and Edward Royce. Ward received a fellowship and attended the Juilliard School of Music in New York from 1939 to 1942, where he studied composition with Frederick Jacobi, orchestration with Bernard Wagenaar, and conducting with Albert Stoessel and Edgar Schenkman. In the summer of 1941 he studied under Aaron Copland at the Berkshire Music Center in Massachusetts. From his student days to the end of World War II, Ward produced about forty compositions, of which eleven he later withdrew. Most of those early works are small scale, songs and pieces for piano or chamber ensembles. He completed his First Symphony in 1941, which won the Juilliard Publication Award the following year. Around that time, Ward also wrote a number of reviews and other articles for the magazine Modern Music and served on the faculty of Queens College. In February 1942 Ward joined the U.S. Army, and attended the Army Music School at Fort Myer, being assigned the military occupational specialty of band director. At Fort Riley, Kansas, he wrote a major part of the score to a musical revue called The Life of Riley. Ward was assigned to the 7th Infantry and sent to the Pacific. For the 7th Infantry Band he wrote a March, and for its dance band he wrote at least two jazz compositions. During his military service Ward met Mary Raymond Benedict, a Red Cross recreation worker. They married on June 19, 1944, and had five children; Melinda, Jonathon, Mark, Johanna and Tim. Major works Ward earned a Bronze Star for meritorious service in the Aleutian Islands. During his military service Ward managed to compose two serious orchestral compositions, Adagio and Allegro, first performed in New York in 1944, and Jubilation: An Overture, which was written mostly on Okinawa, Japan, in 1945, and was premiered at Carnegie Hall by the National Orchestral Association the following spring. After being discharged from military service at the end of the war, Ward returned to Juilliard, earning postgraduate certificate in 1946 and immediately joining the faculty, teaching there until 1956. He served as an Associate in Music at Columbia University from 1946 to 1948. Ward wrote his Second Symphony, dedicated to his wife, in 1947, while living in Nyack, New York. It was premiered by the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Hans Kindler. This symphony was quite popular for a few years, in part thanks to Eugene Ormandy playing it with the Philadelphia Orchestra several times and even taking it on tour to Carnegie Hall in New York and Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. Andrew Stiller, in his article on Ward for The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, describes Ward's musical style as deriving \\"largely from Hindemith, but also shows the considerable influence of Gershwin\\". Ward conducted the Doctors Orchestral Society of New York from 1949 to 1955, wrote his Third Symphony and his First Sonata for Violin and Piano in 1950, the Sacred Songs for Pantheists in 1951, and was music director of the Third Street Music School Settlement from 1952 to 1955, and wrote the Euphony for Orchestra in 1954. He left Juilliard in 1956 to become Executive Vice-President of Galaxy Music Corporation and Managing Editor of High Gate Press in New York, positions he maintained until 1967. Ward wrote his Fourth Symphony in 1958, the Prairie Overture in 1957, the cantata Earth Shall Be Fair and the Divertimento in 1960. Ward wrote his first opera to a libretto by Bernard Stambler, He Who Gets Slapped, and it was premiered in 1956. His next opera, The Crucible, based on Arthur Miller's play, premiered in 1961, became Ward's best known work. For it Ward received the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for Music. It is frequently produced around the world. After the success of The Crucible, Ward received several commissions for ceremonial works, such as Hymn and Celebration in 1962, Music for a Celebration in 1963, Festive Ode in 1966, Fiesta Processional in 1966, and Music for a Great Occasion in 1970. During those years he also wrote the cantata, Sweet Freedom's Song, in 1965; the Fifth Symphony in 1976; a Piano Concerto in 1968, which was commissioned by the Powder River Foundation for the soloist Marjorie Mitchell; a Saxophone Concerto in 1984; and the operas The Lady from Colorado in 1964, Claudia Leqare in 1977, Abelard and Heloise in 1981, Minutes till Midnight in 1982, and Roman Fever in 1993 (based on the short story of the same name by Edith Wharton). He also wrote chamber music, such as the First String Quartet of 1966 and the Raleigh Divertimento of 1985. His work has been championed by such conductors as Igor Buketoff, who recorded the 3rd and 6th symphonies. Later work In 1967, Ward became Chancellor of the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem. He held this post until 1975, when he stepped down to serve as a member of the composition faculty for five more years. In 1978 he came to Duke University as a visiting professor, and there he remained as Mary Duke Biddle Professor of Music from 1979 to 1987.

The need for function approximations arises in many branches of applied mathematics, and computer science in particular . One can distinguish two major classes of function approximation problems: First, for known target functions approximation theory is the branch of numerical analysis that investigates how certain known functions (for example, special functions) can be approximated by a specific class of functions (for example, polynomials or rational functions) that often have desirable properties (inexpensive computation, continuity, integral and limit values, etc.). Second, the target function, call it g, may be unknown; instead of an explicit formula, only a set of points of the form (x, g(x)) is provided. Depending on the structure of the domain and codomain of g, several techniques for approximating g may be applicable. For example, if g is an operation on the real numbers, techniques of interpolation, extrapolation, regression analysis, and curve fitting can be used. If the codomain (range or target set) of g is a finite set, one is dealing with a classification problem instead. To some extent, the different problems (regression, classification, fitness approximation) have received a unified treatment in statistical learning theory, where they are viewed as supervised learning problems.

He was promoted to Tewfik's cabinet and began reforms of Egypt's military and civil administrations, but the demonstrations in Alexandria of 1882 prompted a British bombardment and invasion that deposed  ªUrabi and his allies in favour of a British occupation. Early life He was born in 1841 in the village of Hirriyat Razna near Zagazig in the Sharqia Governorate, approximately 80 kilometres to the north of Cairo.  ªUrabi was the son of a village leader and one of the wealthier members of the community, which allowed him to receive a decent education. After completing elementary education in his home village, he enrolled at Al-Azhar University to complete his schooling in 1849. He entered the army and moved up quickly through the ranks, reaching lieutenant colonel by age 20. The modern education and military service of  ªUrabi, from a fellah, or peasant background, would not have been possible without the modernising reforms of Khedive Ismail, who had done much to eliminate the barriers between the bulk of the Egyptian populace and the ruling elite, who were drawn largely from the military castes that had ruled Egypt for centuries. Ismail abolished the exclusive access to the Egyptian and Sudanese military ranks by Egyptians of Balkan, Circassian, and Turkish origin. Ismail conscripted soldiers and recruited students from throughout Egypt and Sudan regardless of class and ethnic backgrounds in order to form a \\"modern\\" and \\"national\\" Egyptian military and bureaucratic elite class. Without these reforms,  ªUrabi's rise through the ranks of the military would likely have been far more restricted.  Protest against Tewfik  He was a galvanizing speaker. Because of his peasant origins, he was at the time, and is still today, viewed as an authentic voice of the Egyptian people. Indeed, he was known by his followers as 'El Wahid' (the Only One), and when the British poet and explorer Wilfrid Blunt went to meet him, he found the entrance of  ªUrabi's house was blocked with supplicants. When Khedive Tewfik issued a new law preventing peasants from becoming officers,  ªUrabi led the group protesting the preference shown to aristocratic officers (again, largely Egyptians of foreign descent).  ªUrabi repeatedly condemned severe prevalent racial discrimination of Egyptians in the army.Thompson, Elizabeth. \\"Ahmad Urabi and Nazem al- Islam Kermani: Constitutional Justice in Egypt and Iran,\\" Justice Interrupted (Harvard, 2013), 61‚Äì88. He and his followers, who included most of the army, were successful and the law was repealed. In 1879 they formed the Egyptian Nationalist Party in the hopes of fostering a stronger national identity. He and his allies in the army joined with the reformers in February 1882 to demand change. This revolt, also known as the Urabi Revolt, was primarily inspired by his desire for social justice for the Egyptians based on equal standing before the law. With the support of the peasants as well, he launched a broader effort to try to wrest Egypt and Sudan from foreign control, and also to end the absolutist regime of the Khedive, who was himself subject to Anglo-French control under the rules of the Caisse de la Dette Publique. The Arab-Egyptian deputies demanded a constitution that granted the state parliamentary power. The revolt then spread to express resentment of the undue influence of foreigners, including the predominantly Turko-Circassian aristocracy.  Parliament planning   ªUrabi was first promoted to Bey, then made under-secretary of war, and ultimately a member of the cabinet. Plans were developed to create a parliamentary assembly. During the last months of the revolt (July to September 1882), it was claimed that  ªUrabi held the office of Prime Minister of the hastily created common law government based on popular sovereignty. Feeling threatened, Khedive Tewfik requested assistance against  ªUrabi from the Ottoman Sultan, to whom Egypt and Sudan still owed technical fealty. The Sublime Porte hesitated in responding to the request.  British intervention   ªUrabi surrenders to Drury Drury- Lowe The British were especially concerned that  ªUrabi would default on Egypt's massive debt and that he might try to regain control of the Suez Canal. Therefore, they and the French dispatched warships to Egypt to intimidate the nationalists. Tewfik fled to their protection, moving his court to Alexandria. The strong naval presence spurred fears of an imminent invasion (as had been the case in Tunisia in 1881) causing anti-Christian riots to break out in Alexandria on 12 June 1882. The French fleet was recalled to France. The British warships in the harbor opened fire on the city's gun emplacements after the Egyptians ignored an ultimatum from Admiral Seymour to remove them. In September a British army landed in Alexandria but failed to reach Cairo after being checked at the Battle of Kafr El Dawwar. Another army, led by Sir Garnet Wolseley, landed in the Canal Zone and on 13 September 1882 they defeated  ªUrabi's army at the Battle of Tell El Kebir. From there, the British cavalry advanced on Cairo which surrendered without a shot being fired, as did  ªUrabi and the other nationalist leaders.  Exile and return   ªUrabi was tried by the restored Khedivate for rebellion on 3 December 1882. He was defended by British solicitor Richard EveObituary for Richard Eve in The Sphere, 11 July 1900, pg 93 and Alexander Meyrick Broadley. According to Elizabeth Thompson,  ªUrabi's defense stressed the idea that despite the fact that he had been illegally incarcerated by Riyad Pasha and the Khedive Tewfik he had still responded in a manner allowed under Egyptian law and with the hopes that the khedivate remain after his intervention, thus demonstrating loyalty to the Egyptian people as required by his duties.Thompson, Elizabeth. Justice Interrupted: The Struggle for Constitutional Government in the Middle East. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2013. 69. In accordance with an understanding made with the British representative, Lord Dufferin,  ªUrabi pleaded guilty and was sentenced to death, but the sentence was immediately commuted to one of banishment for life. He left Egypt on 28 December 1882 for Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). His home in Halloluwa Road, Kandy (formerly owned by Mudaliyar Jeronis de Soysa) is now the Orabi Pasha Cultural Center. During his time in Ceylon,  ªUrabi worked to improve the quality of education amongst the Muslims in the country. Hameed Al Husseinie College, Sri Lanka's first school for Muslims was established in 15 November 1884 and after eight years Zahira College, was established in 22 August 1892 under his patronage. In May 1901, Khedive Abbas II, Tewfik's son and successor permitted  ªUrabi to return to Egypt. Abbas was a nationalist in the vein of his grandfather, Khedive Ismail the Magnificent, and was deeply opposed to the British occupation of the country.  ªUrabi returned on 1 October 1901, and remained in Egypt until his death on 21 September 1911.Egypt state information Legacy While British intervention was meant to be short term, British forces continued to occupy the country. The British instituted the ousting of Khedive Abbas II in 1914, after which Egypt once more became a sultanate and also a British protectorate. Britain finally recognised Egyptian independence in 1922, following the Egyptian Revolution of 1919.  ªUrabi's revolt had a long lasting significance in Egypt as the first instance of Egyptian anti-imperialist nationalism, which would later play a very important role in Egyptian history. Some historians also note that the 1881‚Äì1882 revolution laid the foundation for mass politics in Egypt. Especially under Gamal Abdel Nasser,  ªUrabi would be regarded as an Egyptian patriot and a national hero; he is also considered an anti-imperialist hero in Sri Lanka.

One of their ideas was Ren & Stimpy, but the show was rejected by the three major US television networks. Sp√ºmc√∏ was officially founded Hollywood in 1989 by cartoonists Kricfalusi, Naylor, Bob Camp and Jim Smith, who were all disappointed at the state of animation and had either been laid off or quit from other animation companies. Soon thereafter, Nickelodeon announced that they were looking for new cartoons, created by cartoonists. Kricfalusi explains the name Sp√ºmc√∏: \\"Well, it's a weird coincidence.

Geraldine Laybourne, the president of Nickelodeon at the time, picked two of these: Ren & Stimpy and Jimmy the Idiot Boy. Ultimately, Kricfalusi decided to sell Ren & Stimpy, which led to Sp√ºmc√∏'s first animated series production, The Ren & Stimpy Show. Because Nickelodeon had no original cartoon material prior to the hiring of Kricfalusi, the network was unaware of the basic process of producing an animated cartoon. Kricfalusi volunteered to give Nickelodeon executives an informative background of cartoonists using storyboards for storytelling in animated cartoons, rather than a script. Vanessa Coffey, who became the executive for The Ren & Stimpy Show, listened to Kricfalusi's lessons and background briefing of the animation industry, and was pleased to learn about how the process works. Coffey agreed with Kricfalusi that, \\"If storyboards were good enough for Bugs Bunny, they were good enough for her.\\" Sp√ºmc√∏ finished the pilot \\"Big House Blues\\" in October 1990 and it aired on August 11, 1991, premiering alongside Doug and Rugrats. Sp√ºmc√∏ continued to produce the show for the next two years, while encountering issues with Nickelodeon standards and practices. Over the next couple of years, a number of episodes were censored. Kricfalusi described Nickelodeon in the earliest period as being \\"simple\\" as there was one executive, Coffey, whom he said that he got along with. Kricfalusi said that another executive, who came during a later period in the show, tried to prevent some of the Ren & Stimpy episodes from being produced. According to Kricfalusi, the episodes continued production since he had established a \\"trade\\" with Coffey of balancing \\"really crazy\\" episodes with \\"heart-warming\\" episodes.Rogers, Troy (interviewer). \\"The Animated Adventures of John K. .\\" UGO.

Kricfalusi confirmed that the primary reason for the Nickelodeon executives' decision seemed to be due to the level of violence in Ren & Stimpy. He specifically referred to the episode \\"Man's Best Friend\\", which features Ren beating the character George Liquor with an oar, as the probable cause for his firing. Nickelodeon banned the episode from airing; the episode did not air in North America until Ren & Stimpy \\"Adult Party Cartoon\\" began in 2003. Bill Wray, a production artist for Ren & Stimpy, described the main issues regarding Kricfalusi's conflict with Nickelodeon as not being able to meet deadlines for production. Wray stated that Kricfalusi attributed the delays to Nickelodeon \\"not approving things fast enough\\", and Nickelodeon staff members \\"changing their minds\\" over what can or cannot be produced.

After keyboardist Rick Wakeman left the group in May 1974 over disagreements with the band's direction, Yes entered rehearsals as a four-piece at bassist Chris Squire's home in Virginia Water, Surrey. During this period, they auditioned several keyboardists including Vangelis before choosing Swiss musician Patrick Moraz who incorporates elements of funk and jazz fusion on the album. Relayer is formed of three tracks, with \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" on side one and \\"Sound Chaser\\" and \\"To Be Over\\" on side two. Relayer received a mixed to positive reception from contemporary and retrospective critics. It reached No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 5 on the US Billboard 200. A single of the closing section of \\"The Gates of Delirium\\", titled \\"Soon\\", was released in January 1975. Relayer continued to sell, and is certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling over 500,000 copies in the US. It was remastered in 2003 and in 2014, both with previously unreleased tracks; the latter includes new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes and additional tracks. Background In April 1974, the Yes line-up of singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and drummer Alan White wrapped their 1973‚Äì1974 tour in support of their previous album, Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973). The album had been a success for the band, reaching number one in the UK for two weeks, and became the first to be certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry based solely on pre- orders. Despite the group's success, during recording the album, Wakeman informed the band of his decision to leave at its conclusion following his disagreements and frustration with the direction the band had taken with the album, with its esoteric concept and its double length which he believed caused the material to suffer as a result. Wakeman confirmed his departure in May 1974, and the news was made public on 8 June. Reduced to a quartet, Yes retreated to Squire's home named New Pipers in Virginia Water, Surrey, which he had purchased in Christmas 1972, and they started rehearsals for the next studio album in his converted garage. After some material had been written, auditions for a new keyboardist were held which involved about eight players, including Jean Roussel, Nick Glennie-Smith of Wally, and Greek musician Vangelis. Moraz said people were flown in from the US and Germany. Anderson was a fan of Vangelis and had tracked him down during the band's stop in Paris on the Topographic Oceans tour. He convinced Vangelis to audition with Yes in England, but they found he was non-committal and too strong a personality for a group. Phil Carson, an Atlantic Records manager and associate of the band, later explained that Vangelis \\"tried out Yes but it didn't really gel ... Vangelis wouldn't get on a plane and wouldn't fly anywhere and Yes were about to go on tour.\\" The possibility of Vangelis joining the band was also affected by a rejection from the Musicians Union. Soon after, Melody Maker reporter and band biographer Chris Welch suggested that the band try Patrick Moraz, a Swiss musician and film composer with a background in jazz and classical music, and a member of the progressive and jazz-fusion trio Refugee. Anderson then listened to Refugee (1974) and took a liking to his playing. Less than a week later, Moraz accepted an invitation from Brian Lane, the band's manager, to attend an audition. Moraz was a fan of the band and had previously met them during their tour of Switzerland in 1969. Moraz's audition with Yes took place in the first week of August 1974. He arrived at Farmyard Studios (owned by Trevor Morais in Little Chalfont, where rehearsals were taking place, early, and saw each member arrive in his own expensive car, and he later stated: \\"Coming from Refugee, where we had been walking three miles to and from our rehearsal place ... it was quite a contrast!\\" Moraz's audition was held using Vangelis's keyboards, which were still situated in the studio. After tuning up, he played some parts to display his ability. They included a short section of \\"And You and I\\" from Close to the Edge (1972), causing the band to stop talking and gather around the keyboards. He was then asked to come up with a section to complement what they had written for the middle section of \\"Sound Chaser\\". The band liked what Moraz had played, and the following day, Lane informed him that Yes was inviting him to join full-time. Moraz felt some pressure to deliver, and drove from his flat in Earl's Court, London to Virginia Water each day to record. Production =Recording= Howe's main guitar on Relayer is a 1955 Fender Telecaster, similar to this one, which marked a departure from his usual Gibson ES-175. Relayer was recorded at Squire's garage studio, marking the first time Yes had made a studio album outside of London. The process was cheaper as they no longer needed to pay fees to book studio time, which allowed the band to spend more time on the music. It is their last from the 1970s to feature Eddie Offord as co-producer before he left to pursue other projects. Having worked with Yes as their producer, engineer, and live sound mixer since 1970, Offord later stated that his time with the group had become \\"a bit stale\\" by the time of Relayer. As Squire's studio did not yet have the right equipment to record, Offord set up a 24-track recording machine and mixing desk using his own equipment, and was joined by Gennaro Rippo as his tape operator. The album's production duties were shared by Offord and the group. After the album was recorded, it was mixed at Advision Studios in London. Having made Tales from Topographic Oceans, a double concept album, Yes scaled back their output and presented Relayer as a single album with a structure similar to Close to the Edge, with one track occupying side one and two tracks on side two. According to Anderson, the band wrote two additional tracks during the album's sessions but did not have enough time to record them. He described one of them as \\"absolutely crazy and intricate\\". For the majority of his parts recorded for the album, Moraz did not write the music on paper and instead relied on his memory except for some particularly precise sections. Recording sessions would last for as long as eight or nine hours. Howe uses a 1955 Fender Telecaster on Relayer, marking a departure from his Gibson ES-175 that he had used since The Yes Album (1971). He also uses a pedal steel guitar. Squire uses a Fender Jazz Bass on \\"To Be Over\\". Moraz uses a number of keyboards that are not found on other Yes albums, including a custom built Vako Orchestron. =Songs= \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" is a 22-minute track that Anderson described as \\"a war song, a battle scene, but it's not to explain war or denounce it ... There's a prelude, a charge, a victory tune, and peace at the end, with hope for the future.\\" Anderson had originally planned to have the entire album based on War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, but instead had a side-long track inspired by the novel. Moraz recalled discussing War and Peace with Anderson, as they had both read the book, after which Moraz showed Anderson a copy of the French science fiction comic Delirius by Philippe Druillet. Moraz said, \\"He related to it immediately so I think that perhaps as a title 'The Gates of Delirium' came from that\\". The song originated from an idea that Anderson had come up with and played to the group on the piano \\"very badly\\", so he was relieved when his bandmates understood what he was trying to do. Anderson and Howe kept track of its structure by recording sections of it on cassette tapes, leaving Anderson to figure out the next part as the group would develop what was put down prior. The song was recorded in sections at a time, though the group was familiar with the entire piece beforehand and spent several weeks recording takes of each section and selecting the ones the members felt were the strongest. Once picked, the sections were edited together and overdubs were then recorded. The battle section includes crashing sound effects that were created by White pushing over a tower of used car parts that he and Anderson had collected from a scrap yard. Howe remembered Anderson becoming too excited in what he envisaged the battle to be, leading the group to produce one mix that was \\"too far gone\\" and another \\"too safe\\". Following the battle, the track concludes with a gentle song that later became known as \\"Soon\\". Anderson later thought that the song did not come across effectively on record, but fared better in concert. \\"Sound Chaser\\" displays Yes' experiment with jazz fusion and funk influences. During Moraz's audition session with the band, he was asked to play an introduction to the song, which was recorded and used on the album after \\"one or two takes\\". He has called his Moog synthesizer solo at the end of the track a highlight moment but felt that the keyboards on the rest of the album were buried in the final mix. Howe thought the track was \\"an indescribable mixture of Patrick's jazzy keyboards and my weird sort of flamenco electric [guitar]\\", yet he disliked Moraz's initial choice of chords he played during his guitar solo, causing Moraz to play it differently, which he disagreed with. Band biographer Dan Hedges compared the track to the style of fusion group Return to Forever. \\"To Be Over\\" originated when Anderson spent an afternoon at Howe's house in London. As the two discussed what music to prepare for the album, Anderson told Howe of his fondness for a melody Howe had written and had sung to Anderson before. Anderson also had the initial lyric: \\"We'll go sailing down the stream tomorrow, floating down the universal stream, to be over\\". Howe gained inspiration for the track from a boat ride on The Serpentine lake in Hyde Park in London. From the beginning, he thought the song was \\"really special\\" and Anderson agreed to develop it further. Howe had come up with the music for this particular section in the late 1960s and took a riff from a track by his earlier group, Tomorrow. Anderson described \\"To Be Over\\" as \\"Strong in content, but mellow in overall attitude ... It's about how you should look after yourself when things go wrong.\\" When the song's lyric was being finalised, Howe suggested having the line \\"She won't know what it means to me\\" follow \\"We go sailing down the calming streams\\", but Anderson changed it to \\"To be over, we will see\\", a change that Howe thought was \\"creatively disguised\\" to make a broader lyrical statement. Moraz felt constricted to perform an improvised keyboard solo for the song, so he wrote down a counterpoint solo \\"exactly like a classical fugue\\" to blend his keyboards with the guitar and bass. He had written an initial version on paper in an evening, yet the band expressed their wish to change the key of the song for the section, causing Moraz to spend several hours rewriting it overnight. =Sleeve design= The album's sleeve was designed and illustrated by English artist Roger Dean, who had designed artwork for the band since 1971, including their logo. In his 1975 book Views, Dean picked the cover as his favourite for Yes, and the recording he enjoyed the most. He revealed his intention of depicting \\"a giant 'gothic' cave\\" for the sleeve, \\"a sort of fortified city for military monks\\". Speaking about the cover in 2004, he said: \\"I was playing with the ideas of the ultimate castle, the ultimate wall of a fortified city. That was more of a fantastical idea. I was looking for the kinds of things like the Knights Templar would have made or what you'd see in the current movie Lord of the Rings. The curving, swirling cantilevers right into space.\\" The images depicted in many of Dean's album covers set an otherworldly tone and are an identifiable part of the band's visual style. For Relayer, the warriors on horseback reflect the lyrical themes of war present in \\"The Gates of Delirium\\". The sleeve includes an untitled four-stanza poem by writer Donald Lehmkuhl dated October 1974, and features band photograph taken by Moraz's former Mainhorse bandmate, Jean Ristori. The album's CD reissue features two additional paintings, and further unused designs are included in Dean's 2008 book Dragon's Dream. At the 1975 edition of the NME Awards, the album won Best Dressed LP. Release Relayer was released in the UK in November 1974 on LP, audio cassette, and 8-track tape, followed by its release in the US on 5 December 1974. It continued the band's commercial success during the 1970s, reaching number 4 on the UK Albums Chart and number 5 on the US Billboard Top LPs chart. Less than two weeks after its release in the US, the album reached gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America on 18 December 1974 for over 500,000 copies sold. A single of the closing section of \\"The Gates of Delirium\\", titled \\"Soon\\" (From \\"The Gates of Delirium\\"), was released as a single on 8 January 1975, with an edited version of \\"Sound Chaser\\" on its B-side. =Reception= Critical reception Relayer received a mostly positive reaction from music critics. Music journalist and author Chris Welch gave a positive review for Melody Maker, praising the album as \\"one of the most successful and satisfying Yes albums\\". He described \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" as a \\"powerful piece ... and benefits by the time structures imposed by this single album.\\" Welch continued to note the band \\"at their best, creating tension and release with consummate ease, and preparing the way for Jon's crystalline vocals\\" at the end of the battle section which segues into \\"Soon\\". In its December 1974 review, Billboard magazine called Relayer \\"another nearly flawless effort\\" by Yes and noted Moraz \\"fits in perfectly\\". It concluded with \\"one of the simpler, yet at the same time, one of the most workable sets the band has come up with.\\" Those who gave the album a negative review thought it was the follow-up to Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973), an album they felt was pretentious and overblown.\\"Top Pop Albums 1955‚Äì2001\\", Joel Whitburn, c.2002 In a retrospective review, AllMusic rated the album three stars out of five, stating Yes had \\"little incentive to curb their musical ambitiousness\\" at the time, the album \\"alternated abrasive, rhythmically dense instrumental sections featuring solos for the various instruments with delicate vocal and choral sections featuring poetic lyrics devoted to spiritual imagery.\\" The band Howe described the music on Relayer as \\"very modern, European style of music, and Patrick brought in a South American flavour as well. It was a very international record\\". Squire thought some of the interaction between his bass and White's drums was better than anything heard on previous Yes albums at that point. Moraz summarised the album's recording as \\"pretty loose, but the energy is there\\". Upon its release, Wakeman was asked to review it for the BBC and felt pleased that the band had made it as it was \\"far too jazzy and freeform, which I didn't like\\". Had the group recorded music more melodic and thematic, he would have felt angry as it would have been the direction that he thought Yes should have adopted. \\"I'm pleased I made the right decision to leave the band when I did\\". =Reissues= Relayer was first reissued on CD in 1988 on the Atlantic in Europe and the US. The CD mastering has been attributed to Zal Schreiber, one of Atlantic's in-house CD mastering engineers at the time. In 1998, a mini-sleeve HDCD version mastered by Isao Kikuchi was released in Japan . In 2003, the album was digitally remastered on Rhino and Elektra Records by George Marino at Sterling Sound. This version included single edits of \\"Soon\\" and \\"Sound Chaser\\" and a studio run-through of \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" with less keyboards and alternate song structures in parts but an identical \\"battle\\" section as heard in the final version. 2009 saw the album remastered by Isao Kikuchi for the Japanese market. The 2003 remastered edition was included in the band's The Studio Albums 1969‚Äì1987 box set, released in 2013. In November 2014, Relayer was reissued as CD/DVD-Audio and CD/Blu-ray disc packs on the Panegyric label with new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes by Steven Wilson. The packs feature bonus tracks including an original master transfer and studio run-through versions of each track. The Blu-ray pack includes an instrumental mix of the album. This remaster does not include the sound effects heard in the middle section of \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" as they were not part of the original multi-track masters. Wilson hypothesised that they were added during the final mixdown of the album from a separate tape source. Live performances =Relayer Tour= Yes supported Relayer with their 1974‚Äì1975 tour of North America and the UK that lasted from 8 November 1974 to 23 August 1975, with the album played in its entirety. The tour culminated with a headline spot at the 1975 Reading Festival. Most dates featured the English band Gryphon as the opening act. Rehearsals lasted for several weeks at Shepperton Studios, Surrey with Offord on sound, stage lighting by their longtime associate Michael Tait, and the set designed by Roger Dean and his brother Martyn. The tour opened with a 31-date leg of the US, for which Moraz had about six weeks to familiarise with the setlist and made use of his 90-minute drive from his London flat to Squire's home to learn it. Ristori assisted by transcribing Yes songs onto paper, forming what Moraz described as \\"memory sheets\\", because of the amount and the complexity of some of his parts. He relied on the sheets for the first few shows on the tour, yet by the time the tour reached Madison Square Garden in New York City less than two weeks later, Moraz realised he had learned the set and stopped using them. The show was a highlight for him: \\"We had a standing ovation for several minutes. The noise was absolutely unbelievable.\\" His rig included 14 keyboards on stage, double the number he had previously worked with. Future Yes singer and producer Trevor Horn, a fan of the band, attended their show on the UK leg and recalled the performance of \\"The Gates of Delirium\\": \\"It got to the end and Jon sang 'Soon' ... I felt like crying. It got me so much. I loved that song so much\\". Yes took an extended hiatus after the tour for each member to produce a solo album. =2021 shows= In 2021, Yes will perform Relayer in its entirety with a selection of tracks from their history as part of their ongoing Album Series tours. The Album Series 2021 Tour will tour mainland Europe in April and May 2021. Track listing Track durations are absent on the original UK vinyl, but were included on North American pressings.

Antrim) to the border at Carrickcarnan (Co. Louth) The A1 is a major route in Northern Ireland. It runs from Belfast via Lisburn and Banbridge to the border with the Republic of Ireland south of Newry, from where the road continues to Dublin, becoming the N1 road and M1 motorway. Between Sprucefield and Carrickcarnan the road forms part of the European route E01. Recent developments The A1 is dual carriageway south from Sprucefield tbut some junctions remain relatively low specification as they necessitate right-turning movements across the central reservation. The busier junctions have been improved by the provision of bridges or underpasses. A flyover was constructed at the busy Rathfriland Road junction in Banbridge and an underpass at the very dangerous Hillsborough road junction in Dromore was completed in June 2005. Improved junctions at Banbridge and Hillsborough opened in September 2009, at Loughbrickland in December 2009 and at Banbridge Road, Dromore in February 2010. The scheme involving the dualling of the A1 between Beech Hill and Cloghogue was completed in July 2010, five months ahead of schedule. Planned developments The Roads Service of Northern Ireland has planned to provide four further grade separated junctions. These schemes are located at: * Listullycurran Road, between Dromore and Hillsborough * Gowdystown Road, south of Dromore * Skeltons Road, between Dromore and Banbridge * Waringsford Road, north of Banbridge. Further measures envisaged to improve safety include a central reservation safety barrier to be constructed from the A1's junction with the M1 at Sprucefield to Loughbrickland. This will involve the closing of many of the dual carriageway's central cross-over points. The Road Service also plan to improve the link between the M1 and A1 at Sprucefield in a scheme that would include a flyover at Hillsborough, replacing the last remaining roundabout on the route between Dublin and Belfast.

The density transformation from P to Q is given by the Girsanov theorem. In probability theory, the Girsanov theorem (named after Igor Vladimirovich Girsanov) describes how the dynamics of stochastic processes change when the original measure is changed to an equivalent probability measure. The theorem is especially important in the theory of financial mathematics as it tells how to convert from the physical measure, which describes the probability that an underlying instrument (such as a share price or interest rate) will take a particular value or values, to the risk-neutral measure which is a very useful tool for pricing derivatives on the underlying instrument. History Results of this type were first proved by Cameron‚ÄìMartin in the 1940s and by Girsanov in 1960. They have been subsequently extended to more general classes of process culminating in the general form of Lenglart (1977). Significance Girsanov's theorem is important in the general theory of stochastic processes since it enables the key result that if Q is an absolutely continuous measure with respect to P then every P-semimartingale is a Q-semimartingale. Statement We state the theorem first for the special case when the underlying stochastic process is a Wiener process. This special case is sufficient for risk-neutral pricing in the Black‚ÄìScholes model and in many other models (for example, all continuous models). Let \\\\\\\\{W_t\\\\\\\\} be a Wiener process on the Wiener probability space \\\\\\\\{\\\\Omega,\\\\mathcal{F},P\\\\\\\\}. Let \\\\\\\\{X_t\\\\\\\\} be a measurable process adapted to the natural filtration of the Wiener process \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{F}^W_t\\\\\\\\} with X_0 = 0. Define the Dol√©ans-Dade exponential \\\\mathcal{E}(X)_t of X with respect to W :\\\\mathcal{E}(X)_t=\\\\exp \\\\left ( X_t - \\\\frac{1}{2} [X]_t \\\\right ), where [X]_t is the quadratic variation of X_t. If \\\\mathcal{E}(X)_t is a strictly positive martingale, a probability measure Q can be defined on \\\\\\\\{\\\\Omega,\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\\\\\} such that we have Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative :\\\\frac{d Q}{d P} \\\\bigg_{\\\\mathcal{F}_t} = \\\\mathcal{E} (X )_t Then for each t the measure Q restricted to the unaugmented sigma fields \\\\mathcal{F}^W_t is equivalent to P restricted to \\\\mathcal{F}^W_t . Furthermore, if Y is a local martingale under P, then the process :\\\\tilde Y_t = Y_t - \\\\left[ Y,X \\\\right]_t is a Q local martingale on the filtered probability space \\\\\\\\{\\\\Omega,\\\\mathcal{F},Q,\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{F}^W_t\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\}. Corollary If X is a continuous process and W is Brownian motion under measure P then : \\\\tilde W_t =W_t - \\\\left [ W, X \\\\right]_t is Brownian motion under Q. The fact that \\\\tilde W_t is continuous is trivial; by Girsanov's theorem it is a Q local martingale, and by computing the quadratic variation :\\\\left[\\\\tilde W \\\\right]_t= \\\\left[W_t, W_t\\\\right] - 2 \\\\left[W_t, [W, X]_t\\\\right] + \\\\left W, X]_t, [W, X]_t \\\\right] = \\\\left [ W \\\\right]_t = t it follows by L√©vy's characterization of Brownian motion that this is a Q Brownian motion. =Comments= In many common applications, the process X is defined by :X_t = \\\\int_0^t Y_s\\\\, d W_s. If X is of this form, then a sufficient condition for \\\\mathcal{E}(X) to be a martingale is Novikov's condition, which requires that : E_P\\\\left [\\\\exp\\\\left (\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_0^T Y_s^2\\\\, ds\\\\right )\\\\right ] < \\\\infty. The stochastic exponential \\\\mathcal{E}(X) is the process Z, which solves the stochastic differential equation : Z_t = 1 + \\\\int_0^t Z_s\\\\, d X_s.\\\\, The measure Q constructed above is not equivalent to P on \\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\infty, as this would only be the case if the Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative were a uniformly integrable martingale, which the exponential martingale described above is not (for \\\\lambda e0). Application to finance In finance, Girsanov theorem is used each time one needs to derive an asset's or rate's dynamics under a new probability measure. The most well known case is moving from historic measure P to risk neutral measure Q which is done‚Äîin Black‚ÄìScholes model‚Äîvia Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative: \\\\frac{d Q}{d P} = \\\\mathcal{E}\\\\left ( \\\\int_0^\\\\cdot \\\\frac{r - \\\\mu }{\\\\sigma}\\\\, d W_s \\\\right ) where r denotes the instantaneous risk free rate, \\\\mu the asset's drift and \\\\sigma its volatility. Other classical applications of Girsanov theorem are quanto adjustments and the calculation of forwards' drifts under LIBOR market model.

The Visible Human Project is an effort to create a detailed data set of cross-sectional photographs of the human body, in order to facilitate anatomy visualization applications. It is used as a tool for the progression of medical findings, in which these findings link anatomy to its audiences. A male and a female cadaver were cut into thin slices which were then photographed and digitized. The project is run by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) under the direction of Michael J. Ackerman. Planning began in 1986;Burke, L., & Weill, B. (2009). Chapter 10. Information technology for the health professions (3rd ed., p. 212). Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Pearson Prentice Hall. the data set of the male was completed in November 1994 and the one of the female in November 1995. The project can be viewed today at the U.S. National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, MD. There are currently efforts to repeat this project with higher resolution images but only with parts of the body instead of a cadaver.  Data  Cryosection through the abdomen of a human male, including the upper extremities. The male cadaver was encased and frozen in a gelatin and water mixture in order to stabilize the specimen for cutting. The specimen was then ‚Äúcut‚Äù in the axial plane at 1 millimeter intervals. Each of the resulting 1,871 ‚Äúslices‚Äù was photographed in both analog and digital, yielding 15 gigabytes of data. In 2000, the photos were rescanned at a higher resolution, yielding more than 65 gigabytes. The female cadaver was cut into slices at .33 millimeter intervals, resulting in some 40 gigabytes of data. The term ‚Äúcut‚Äù is a bit of a misnomer, yet it is used to describe the process of grinding away the top surface of a specimen at regular intervals. The term ‚Äúslice,‚Äù also a misnomer, refers to the revealed surface of the specimen to be photographed; the process of grinding the surface away is entirely destructive to the specimen and leaves no usable or preservable ‚Äúslice‚Äù of the cadaver. The data are supplemented by axial sections of the whole body obtained by computed tomography, axial sections of the head and neck obtained by magnetic resonance imaging, and coronal sections of the rest of the body also obtained by magnetic resonance imaging. The scanning, slicing and photographing took place at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, where additional cutting of anatomical specimens continues to take place.  Donors  The male cadaver is from Joseph Paul Jernigan, a 38-year-old Texas murderer who was executed by lethal injection on August 5, 1993. At the prompting of a prison chaplain he had agreed to donate his body for scientific research or medical use, without knowing about the Visible Human Project. Some people have voiced ethical concerns over this. One of the most notable statements came from the University of Vienna which demanded that the images be withdrawn with reference to the point that the medical profession should have no association with executions, and that the donor's informed consent could be scrutinised.Roeggla G., U. Landesmann and M. Roeggla: Ethics of executed person on Internet. [Letter]. Lancet. 28. January 1995; 345(0):260. The 59-year-old female donor remains anonymous. In the press she has been described as a Maryland housewife who died from a heart attack and whose husband requested that she be part of the project. In 2000, Susan Potter‚Äîa cancer survivor and a disability rights activist‚Äîbecame the third body donor to the project, spending the 15 following years until her death by pneumonia in 2015 as an outspoken advocate for medical education and a mentor of medical students at the University of Colorado. For nearly two decades, National Geographic documented the story of Susan Potter and Dr. Victor M. Spitzer, the director of the Center for Human Simulation at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus who led the NIH-funded project, releasing a video documentary in 2018. By the time Potter met Spitzer in 2000, she had gone through 26 surgeries and had been diagnosed with melanoma, breast cancer and diabetes: her participation in the Visible Human Project marked a significant departure from the original goals of the project, which up until then had only focused on the dissection and imaging of healthy bodies.  Problems with the data sets  Freezing caused the brain of the man to be slightly swollen, and his middle ear ossicles were lost during preparation of the slices. Nerves are hard to make out since they have almost the same color as fat, but many have nevertheless been identified. Small blood vessels were collapsed by the freezing process. Tendons are difficult to cut cleanly, and they occasionally smear across the slice surfaces. The male has only one testicle, is missing his appendix, and has tissue deterioration at the site of lethal injection. Also visible are tissue damage to the dorsum of each forearm by formalin injection and damage to the right sartorius from opening the right femoral vein for drainage. The male was also not \\"cut\\" while in standard anatomical position, so the cuts through his arms are oblique. The female was missing 14 body parts which includes nose cartilage. The reproductive organs of the woman are not representative of those of a young woman. The specimen contains several pathologies, including cardiovascular disease and diverticulitis.  Discoveries  By studying the data set, researchers at Columbia University found several errors in anatomy textbooks, related to the shape of a muscle in the pelvic region and the location of the urinary bladder and prostate.J. Venuti, C. Imielinska, P. Molholt: \\"New Views of Male Pelvic Anatomy: Role of Computer Generated 3D Images\\" Clinical Anatomy 17:261‚Äì2712004.  License  The data may be bought on tape or downloaded free of charge; one has to specify the intended use and sign a license agreement that allows NLM to use and modify the resulting application. NLM can cancel the agreement at any time, at which point the user has to erase the data files.  Applications using the data  Various projects to make the raw data more useful for educational purposes are under way. It is necessary to build a three- dimensional virtual model of the body where the organs are labeled, may be removed selectively and viewed from all sides, and ideally are even animated. Two commercial software products accomplish the majority of these goals, the VH Dissector from Touch of Life Technologies and ‚ÄúVoxel-Man 3D-Navigator‚Äù from the University of Hamburg Hoehne K. H. et al.: VOXEL-MAN 3D-Navigator: Inner Organs. Regional, Systemic and Radiological Anatomy. Springer Electronic Media, New York, 2003 (DVD-ROM, ). NLM itself has started an open source project, the Insight Toolkit, whose aim is to automatically deduce organ boundaries from the data. The data were used for Alexander Tsiaras's book and CD-ROM ‚ÄúBody Voyage‚Äù which features a three-dimensional tour through the body.Tsiaras A.: Body Voyage: A Three-Dimensional Tour of a Real Human Body. Warner Books, New York, 1997 (). A \\"Virtual Radiography\\" application creates Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs and ‚Äúvirtual surgery‚Äù, where endoscopic procedures or balloon angioplasty are simulated: the surgeon can view the progress of the instrument on a screen and receives realistic tactile feedback according to what kind of tissue the instrument would currently be touching. Several other educational applications utilized form the visible human project include: multiple interactive anatomy computer software programs (Anatomage), multimodality image restoration for hospital patients, body system relationships, and volumetric data. The male data set was used in \\"Project 12:31\\", a series of photographic light paintings by Croix Gagnon and Frank Schott, and is the male Caucasian cadaver on the Anatomage Table 6.0 application.

This route has always been of importance as a connection between the British capital city of London and sea trade routes to Continental Europe. It was originally known as the Dover Road.The Illustrated Road Book of England and Wales (1961). The Automobile Association: 32 Unlike the other single digit A-roads in Great Britain, the A2 does not form a zone boundary (in this case between Zone 1 and Zone 2). The Zone 1/2 boundary is the River Thames. History of the route The route of the current A2 follows a similar route to that of a Celtic ancient trackway. It was an important route for the Romans linking London with Canterbury and the three Channel ports of Rutupiae (now Richborough), Dubris (now Dover) and Portus Lemanis (in modern Lympne). It had river crossings at Rochester over the River Medway; Dartford (River Darent) and Crayford (River Cray). The Romans paved the road and constructed the first Rochester Bridge across the Medway. Access to London was via London Bridge which was first constructed by the Romans in AD 50. The road was known as 'Item a Londinio ad portum Dubris' and appeared in the Antonine Itinerary, a contemporary map of Roman roads in Britain. In Anglo-Saxon times it became part of a longer road known as W√¶celinga Str√¶t ('Watling Street' in modern English). Rochester Bridge was rebuilt in stone in 1391 and the 'Wardens and Commonalty of Rochester Bridge' were created to maintain the bridge, the modern equivalent of which, the Rochester Bridge Trust, still manages the current crossing. By the 17th century, the road had fallen into disrepair and sections were converted into turnpike roads by various Turnpike Acts passed by Parliament. The section from Gravesend and Rochester was turnpiked in 1712 and then from Chatham to Canterbury in 1730; the section from there to Dover was only turnpiked in the 19th century by which time it was known as the Great Dover Road. Rochester Bridge was rebuilt in cast iron in 1856 (and rebuilt again in 1914 with a second bridge in 1970). The London, Chatham and Dover Railway completed a railway route from London to Dover in the 1860s. Access to London from the A2 across the River Thames was improved with the completion of Tower Bridge (1894), Blackwall Tunnel (1897) and the Rotherhithe Tunnel (1908). The road was given the reference A2 within the Great Britain road numbering scheme in the 1920s. The Dartford Southern By-pass, which relieved chronic congestion on the old route through Dartford (along what is now the A207) provided considerable local employment during the Post‚ÄìWorld War I recession. It was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1924. It is estimated that the project provided 63,500 days work to local unemployed people. The Dartford Crossing opened as a single tunnel in 1963, then a second tunnel opened in 1980 to provide additional traffic on the A2, and the M2 Motorway opened in stages between 1963 and 1965 providing an alternative faster route for long-distance traffic avoiding the A2 through Rochester and Chatham. The 3-lane stretch of the A2 between Falconwood and Cobham was built in stages from around 1963 until 1973. A section of Ringway 3 (part of the proposed M16 motorway linking to the A2, which later formed part of the M25 motorway opened between 1974 and 1977. The Rochester Way Relief Road, in Kidbrooke and Eltham, was opened in 1988. The M20 motorway to Folkestone was constructed in stages from the 1960s and provided a faster route to Dover following extensions built in the early 1990s after which traffic levels on the M2 and A2 reduced. The Queen Elizabeth II Bridge opened in 1991. A new flyover for A2 Westbound to M25 Northbound traffic was completed in late 2007. In 2008, a section of the A2 beside Gravesend was widened to 3 or 4 lanes between Pepperhill (suburb of Northfleet) to Cobham. It was also re-routed away from the houses of Gravesend/Singlewell to make room for the new lanes and reduce the amount of noise and pollution from the widened roads. The old route of the A2 (the Roman road) has been made into a combined footpath and cyclepath. The new road section opened in 2009.http://www.skanska.co.uk/Global/About%20Skanska/Sustainability/March%202010/A2,%20UK%20Sustainability%20Case%20Study.pdf A section of the old road has been turned into Cyclopark, with footpaths, cyclepaths and an equestrian route along the old road. Proposed developments A new Lower Thames Crossing down river from the Dartford Crossing linking to the A2 has been proposed by the Department for Transport in 2009. The route today Its original alignment roughly followed a mix of the ancient Celtic route and the turnpike road to Dover. The Roman alignment, however, is not easy to identify and much of the original A2 does not exactly follow what is known of the Roman route (the straightness of many long stretches is misleading). A section of the modern A2 from Rochester to the Roman settlement of Vagniacae, modern Springhead, is believed to roughly follow the Roman route. =Borough to Shooter's Hill= Blackheath. The A2 starts at Borough in Central London, at a junction with the A3, near the church of St George the Martyr. The remains of a small Roman temple was excavated at Tabard Square in 2003. The A2 at this point is named Great Dover Street, and is the only part of the A2 within the congestion charging zone. At the end of the road, it meets the London Inner Ring Road and becomes a primary route. The A2 heads along Old Kent Road towards New Cross, where the A20 breaks away. The A2 continues east through Deptford and Blackheath until it arrives at the Shooter's Hill Interchange with the A102 near Greenwich. A section of the Roman road has been identified running through Greenwich Park on an alignment with Vanbrugh Park. =Shooter's Hill to Three Crutches= A2 at Leyton Cross At Shooter's Hill, Watling Street and the A2 part company, as Watling Street continues along the A207. At this point the A2 joins a dual carriageway, the Rochester Way Relief Road (the carriageways to the north of this junction being the A102 Blackwall Tunnel Approach) with a speed limit of 50 mph (80 km/h). The A2 meets traffic lights at Kidbrooke; this is the last set of lights out of Greater London (the lights only apply to traffic turning right onto the A2213). Shortly after here, the A2 crosses the A205 South Circular Road and becomes a motorway in all but name, with 3 lanes and a hard shoulder in each direction. Within the London section the left hand lane is used for local traffic. At Falconwood, the road becomes the East Rochester Way ‚Äì this point was once the westbound terminus of the dual carriageway. There are exits for Bexleyheath, Black Prince (at Bexley), and other south east London suburbs. Motorists should be aware that the stretch between the Blackwall Tunnel Approach and Dartford Heath is patrolled by average speed cameras. Just before the A2 reaches the junction with the A2018, the speed limit increases to the national speed limit (70 mph, 112 km/h) and the road heads east into Kent towards Dartford, bypassing the town to the south and cutting through Dartford Heath. The next junction links the road to the M25 London Orbital Motorway at Dartford; the next, (Bean Interchange), is for the B255 and A296 for Bluewater, where Watling Street rejoins the A2. The A2 then bypasses Gravesend, before merging into the M2 at Three Crutches Interchange, near Strood. This latter section, from the Pepper Hill Interchange (near Northfleet and the Ebbsfleet International railway station), to the Cobham Interchange underwent extensive works (2007‚Äì2009) to move the entire carriageway south to run parallel to the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, so as to move the road away from residential housing ‚Äì and to continue with a fourth lane in each direction, with grade separated junctions. =Three Crutches to Brenley Corner= Looking west: the modern A2 crossing the River Medway at Rochester near the Roman and Celt crossings The A2 reverts to a non-primary single carriageway road at this point. The M2 now parts company to bypass the Medway Towns, while the A2 heads into them. It enters Strood before crossing the River Medway into Rochester. The A2 bypasses the old High Street, heading instead along Corporation Street alongside the railway lines. It crosses the old High Street, climbs Star Hill and heads east into Chatham where it meets the A230 and A231. There used to be one way ring road but it was changed to two way running in 2006 and was partially closed to all but buses and taxis in 2009 meaning the ring road was no more. The A2 heads to the south of Gillingham, where the A289 Medway Northern Bypass joins it. The A278 departs from the A2 to head south to meet the M2, whereas the A2 goes through Rainham and Newington before entering green country for the first time since Three Crutches. The road meets the A249, now dualled, to the west of Sittingbourne, before going through the town itself (bypassing the now-pedestrianised High Street, as it does in Rochester and Chatham). Leaving Sittingbourne, the A2 continues east in almost a straight line, for it is still along the alignment of Watling Street at this point. At Ospringe it passes the Maison Dieu, now a museum of Roman artifacts but originally a wayside hospital commissioned by Henry III in 1234. The A2 continues to Faversham, but doesn't (and never has done) go through the town, preferring to almost bypass it to the south. A mile (1.6 km) later, it arrives at Brenley Corner, junction 7 of the M2. =Brenley Corner To Dover Docks= At Brenley Corner, the A2 once again becomes a primary dual carriageway. Straight after the interchange, Dunkirk and Boughton are bypassed as the A2 continues towards Canterbury and Dover. Formerly it went through Canterbury city centre, this has now been bypassed and the original route is now called the A2050. It breaks off from the A2 at Harbledown ‚Äì just after Gate Services ‚Äì taking all Canterbury traffic with it. At Wincheap, the A28 meets the A2, although only westbound traffic can exit the A2 at this point. The A2050 rejoins the A2 at Bridge. Traffic for the Channel Tunnel and Folkestone leaves at the junction with the A260, and shortly after this junction the A2 loses its dual carriageway status, regains it, and loses it again within a few miles. Now single carriageway, the A2 forms the Dover bypass. It meets the A256 for Sandwich and Ramsgate at a briefly dualled section, before reverting to single carriageway for the final time.

It is historically known as the Bath Road with newer sections including the Great West Road and Portway. The road was once the main route from London to Bath, Bristol and the west of England and formed, after the A40, the second main western artery from London. Although most traffic is carried by the M4 motorway today, the A4 still acts as the main route from Bristol to London for non-motorway traffic. History =Turnpikes= The A4 has gone through many transformations through the ages from pre-Roman routes, Roman roads (such as the one passing Silbury Hill), and basic wagon tracks. During the Middle Ages, most byways and tracks served to connect villages with their nearest market town. A survey of Savernake Forest near Hungerford in 1228 mentions \\"The King‚Äôs Street\\" running between the town and Marlborough. This street corresponded roughly with the route of the modern A4. In 1632, Thomas Witherings was appointed Postmaster of Foreign Mails by Charles I. Three years later, the king charged him with building six \\"Great Roads\\" to aid in the delivery of the post, of which the Great West Road was one. It was not until the 17th century that a distinct route between London and Bristol started to resemble today's road. During the 17th century, the A4 was known as the Great Road to Bristol. When Queen Anne started patronising the spa city of Bath, the road became more commonly known as Bath Road. Over the years, the direction of the road has taken many detours depending on such factors as changes in tolls or turnpike patronage. For example, in 1750 the toll road from London was altered to go through Melksham; and in 1695 the map maker, John Ogilby, produced a map of the Hungerford area of the Great West Road showing two possible routes. As Bath became more popular with the wealthy and famous, it was inevitable that turnpike trusts would be set up under the terms of the Turnpike Acts to pay for maintenance and improvements to the road. The first turnpike on this road was between Reading and Theale in 1714. Due to increasing traffic, sections of the road between Kensington, over Hounslow Hill, to Twyford were turnpike by 1717 with the remaining sections placed under turnpike trusts. Strip Map of Bath Road 1786. As turnpike trusts were individually run, there was the possibility for greatly differing road conditions, especially over the London Clay basin of Kensington, Brentford, Hounslow and Slough, where winter conditions left the way muddy and uneven. This was not always the case with the Bath Road, as many of the wealthy landowners along the route co-operated informally and exercised a large amount of control over feeder roads. As a result, control of the Bath Road was easy to maintain and many inns and towns became prosperous. Tollhouses were established at Colnbrook, Maidenhead, Twyford, Castle Street Reading, Thatcham and Benham. During the 1820s, the employment of good surveyors improved the condition of the road and aided an increased flow of wealthy travellers. The tolls raised from such clientele ensured that when the turnpike trusts handed over the route to local highway boards, they had no financial liabilities. Justices of the Peace were empowered by the 1862 Rural Highways Act to combine turnpike trusts into Highways Districts. This meant that by the late 1860s trusts were either not renewing their powers or were being terminated by General Acts of Parliament. For example, most turnpikes in Berkshire, including the Bath Road, were officially wound up by 1878 when legislation transferred responsibility for dis-enturnpiked roads to the new county councils. The tollgate on the Bath Road west of Reading was removed in 1864 as the outward pressure of urban development made rates a more acceptable way of financing the maintenance of what was now a suburban road. =Postal service and coaching= With the improvement being made to the road systems, the business of moving mail became easier and thus more profitable as volumes were able to increase. In Bristol, a postal office had been well established by the 1670s. The journey time to London at this period was about 16 and three quarter hours. A letter from Bath in 1684 took about 3 days going via a postal office in Marshfield on the Bristol Road. (The route to Bristol did not yet go through Bath at this time). Journey times during the Turnpike era fell with the improvements from 2 days in 1752 to 38 hours in 1782 and 18 hours by 1836. Royal Mail coaches in 1836 were able to do the trip in 12 to 13 hours. Further improvements to regional post services were made between 1719 and 1763 due to contracts with the London Inland Letter Office negotiated by Ralph Allen, the postmaster of Bath. In the early part of the 19th century, coaching was at its height with six stagecoaches each day carrying passengers to and from London along the Bath Road in 1830, rising to ten by 1836. Hungerford is at about the midway point of the journey between London and Bristol and was ideally positioned to take advantage of the increase in coaching. In 1836, five companies operated a coaching service through Hungerford. This peak was to be short-lived following the construction of the Great Western Railway. The decline in coaching traffic in Hungerford coincided with the building of the Great Western Railway from London to Bath and Bristol, and the subsequent Berks and Hants Railway line from Newbury to Hungerford itself in 1847. By 1843, it was reported that the stage coaches had ceased running between Bristol and London. Route =Holborn Circus to Westminster (0.4 miles)= View down New Fetter Lane from Holborn Circus, with J Sainsbury head office on the right The A4 begins as New Fetter Lane in the City of London at Holborn Circus on the A40. It goes in a southerly direction to join Fleet Street where many British national newspapers at one time had their head offices. The Office of Fair Trading has its main office here. =Westminster to Hammersmith via Kensington (4.6 miles)= The road heads west through the City of Westminster via the Strand, passing notable landmarks such as the Royal Courts of Justice, the Savoy and Adelphi theatres, and Charing Cross railway station. From Charing Cross station to Green Park, the westbound and eastbound routes of the A4 are considerably different, due to one-way systems. Westbound, the A4 continues along the Strand up to Charing Cross itself, then along Cockspur Street and into Pall Mall, the location of many exclusive gentlemen's clubs as well as the Institute of Directors, before turning right along St James's Street to reach Piccadilly. Eastbound from Green Park, the A4 runs along the full length of Piccadilly to Piccadilly Circus, before turning right along Haymarket. It bears left along Pall Mall East, then right along the west side of Trafalgar Square, past the National Gallery and Canada House, to Charing Cross. Finally, it bears left along the east side of the Square, past South Africa House, then right along Duncannon Street to reach Charing Cross station. The first part of Regent Street, from Waterloo Place to Piccadilly Circus, is also signed as the A4; all traffic here runs in a northbound direction. Piccadilly Circus From Green Park, the A4 enters a short tunnel under Hyde Park Corner, where Wellington Arch is located. Afterwards, the road continues along the first part of Knightsbridge, before bearing left onto Brompton Road. This is an affluent area of London, in which the Harrods and Harvey Nichols department stores are located as well as numerous embassies. At this point, the road enters the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. At the Brompton Oratory, the road bears right along Thurloe Place and Cromwell Gardens, past the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Ismaili Centre, and onto Cromwell Road, past the Natural History Museum. At Earls Court, the A4 becomes dual carriageway, and continues along West Cromwell Road, over the West London Line into West Kensington and the Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. A section of the road from Knightsbridge to the Chiswick Flyover was the first section of Clearway designated in London. It introduced no stopping on the road during rush hours on 21 August 1961. =Hammersmith to Heathrow Airport (10.7 miles)= Hammersmith Flyover The A4 continues along Talgarth Road past the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. The road becomes elevated at the Hammersmith Flyover and heads towards Heathrow Airport along the Great West Road, passing Hammersmith's two churches of St Paul and St Peter. At this point the road is close to the River Thames. The road enters Chiswick and the Borough of Hounslow, passing Fuller's Brewery. After Hogarth Roundabout, the road passes Hogarth's House and is called Hogarth Lane, then Ellesmere Road and Cedars Road. It becomes the Great West Road again just a few yards short of the start of Chiswick Flyover, which is junction 1 of the M4. Gunnersbury's Russian Orthodox Cathedral is clearly visible on the right. The road then passes the Glaxo-Smith Kline premises in Brentford where it follows underneath its successor the M4 as far as the bridge over the River Brent. The stretch between Chiswick's western border to Syon Lane (Gillette Corner) is known as the Golden Mile with some notable Art Deco factories. The road remains as the Great West Road through Osterley and Hounslow where it splits with the A30, which is known as the Great South West Road. Between the two world wars, the Great West Road was built as a bypass to relieve traffic congestion in Brentford and Hounslow. After the A30, the A4 changes its name to Bath Road, enters Cranford, and crosses the River Crane into the Borough of Hillingdon. It then passes along the northern boundary of Heathrow Airport, before leaving the London suburbs over the M25 towards the west. =Heathrow Airport to Slough (6.7 miles)= Heathrow Airport After leaving Heathrow Airport, still the A4, it becomes the Colnbrook Bypass and climbs over the M25 motorway. This bypass for the narrow main road of Colnbrook was built after the Second World War across farmland between Harmondsworth and the outskirts of Langley. The next major intersection is junction 5 of the M4 (Slough-East) known as the Langley junction. At this point the A4 loses its trunk road classification. Continuing towards Slough town centre, the road, now named London Road, passes Kedermister Park on the right. Changing into Sussex Place, the architecturally impressive St Bernard's former convent is on the right. Becoming the dual carriageway Wellington Street (a late 1960s bypass for the High Street), Tesco's massive 'aircraft hangar' supermarket is on the right and the Queensmere and Observatory Shopping Centres on the left. The end of this section of the Great Western Road is in the centre of Slough at the junction of William Street and Wellington Street. This spot was formerly the site of Slough's largest roundabout on the south-east corner of Thames Valley University. Nearby is Slough railway station, served by Great Western Railway. The roundabout was removed in 2011 and the university's Slough campus closed in 2011 after planning permission was granted for 1,598 flats. =Slough to Maidenhead (6.0 miles)= The A4 in Slough Continuing from the William Street / Wellington Street junction, in the centre of Slough, the road heads westwards towards Maidenhead. The short stretch of dual carriageway is Wellington Street, then briefly on the most western end of the High Street, over the railway bridge for the line between Slough and Windsor Central Station. The Bath Road begins on the west side of the bridge. On the left is Slough's 1936 Town Hall, now abandoned by the local council, and on the right Salt Hill Park. The next major road intersection is by the Three Tuns Pub where the A4 crosses the A355. This road goes north towards Farnham Royal, Farnham Common, Beaconsfield and the M40 at junction 2. To the south, it goes towards the M4 (junction 6, Slough Centre) and Windsor. The route at this point runs parallel to both the Great Western Main Line and the M4. The road continues past the southern fringe of Slough Trading Estate. Maidenhead Bridge crossing the River Thames On Slough's western boundary is the Huntercombe Spur roundabout linking the A4 to junction 7 of the M4 motorway. Here the dual carriageway ends. The road bends right at Taplow and passes under a high railway bridge, then over the River Thames flood prevention channel. The road then goes over Maidenhead's old bridge Maidenhead Bridge, spanning the River Thames, and into the eastern outskirts of Maidenhead. Along Bridge Road, St Cloud Way and Bad Godesberg Way respectively. The centre of Maidenhead is reached at the roundabout that forms the junction with the A308. Turning northwards on the A308 would lead to the A404 towards Marlow and High Wycombe. Southwards, the A308 heads towards Windsor and provides an opportunity to branch off for junction 8/9 of the M4. =Maidenhead to Reading (12.3 miles)= Heading out of Maidenhead town centre, the road follows Castle Hill and then Bath Road. At the outskirts, the road forms part of junction 9b of the A404(M)/A404, which links junction 8/9 of the M4 with junction 4 of the M40 at Handy Cross. The A4 crosses open countryside before following New Bath Road on the outskirts of Twyford. This is a bypass, built in 1929, that deviates from the old route of the A4, and crosses the River Loddon on its way into the suburbs of Reading via the village of Charvil. The A4 passes the King George's Field in Sonning, which are used as playing fields, and the Reading Cricket and Hockey Club. As it enters Reading, along the London Road again, it crosses the junction of the A3290 next to Palmer Park, which leads to Junction 10 of the M4. Cemetery Junction, Reading in 1976 The A4 goes over the intersection with the A329 Cemetery Junction which links Wokingham with Pangbourne, passing the Royal Berkshire Hospital and the London Road Campus of the University of Reading. At London Street and again at Southampton Street, the A4 meets the A327 twice, since the latter loops round on two branches which meet at Whitley Street. Between the two junctions, the A4 becomes Crown Street for approximately 150 metres. =Reading to Newbury (16.7 miles)= On the other side of the intersection the A4 follows Pell Street and continues westward. Here it crosses the River Kennet, the Holy Brook and the A33 relief road, which goes towards Basingstoke. In West Reading, the A4 becomes Berkeley Avenue, and then continues onto another Castle Hill and then the Bath Road. It passes Prospect Park, and the suburbs of Southcote, Horncastle and Calcot, before reaching Junction 12 of the M4. The A4 heads south westerly through Theale and over the roundabout connecting it to the A340 which heads towards Pangbourne. Heading towards Thatcham, the road passes Aldermaston Wharf next to the Kennet and Avon Canal and through the villages of Woolhampton and Midgham. A large industrial estate is on the left as the road enters Thatcham. At the roundabout after the industrial Estate the route follows London Road and passes Thatcham towards Benham Hill and Newbury. At the Benham Hill roundabout it goes along Bath Road where it deviates from Turnpike Road. Bath Road is the original turnpiked road and the road now confusingly called Turnpike Road was originally called The Shaw Road.Thatcham Road Names, 1991, Roy Tubb The turnpike then continues along London Road as it enters the outskirts of Newbury. Heading towards the centre of Newbury, the route passes the West Berkshire Community Hospital on the right. To the North of the town centre the road becomes part of an unusual junction with the A339 that links the new A34 by-pass to the north with Basingstoke to the south. The junction is a combination of a figure of eight roundabout with an elevated section that used to be the old route of the A34. =Newbury to Marlborough (18.8 miles)= Aerial view of High Street, Marlborough After the junction, the road heads out of town through Speenhamland along Western Avenue and Bath Road to the junction with the A34 Newbury bypass. The Newbury bypass was opened, after some controversy, on 17 November 1998, at a cost of ¬£104 million. The route heads over undulating countryside in a fairly straight westward direction towards Hungerford parallel to the Kennet and Avon Canal and crossing the River Kennet on the outskirts of the town at the same time as intersecting with the A338. The route does not enter the town centre, but continues westward to the northern side of town on its way to Marlborough via the village of Froxfield and the northern edge of Savernake Forest. On entering the outskirts of Marlborough the road follows London Road. Crossing the River Kennet again it briefly shares the highway with the A346 which connects northwards to Swindon. It splits again at a roundabout along New Road and Oxford Street into the town centre on the High Street. The High Street is a traditional main thoroughfare for an English market town, in that it is wide, with space for market stalls on either side and in the middle, though these spaces are usually marked for car parking. Until the late 1980s most of this section, and some of the following Wiltshire section, was configured as three lanes, with the central lane available for overtaking traffic in either direction. This is no longer considered safe so the road now has one wider- than-normal lane in each direction, with ghost islands at junctions to discourage overtaking at these points. =Marlborough to Chippenham (18.9 miles)= Aerial view of Silbury Hill The A4 continues along the High Street on its way out of Marlborough via Bridewell Street and Bath Road. The road passes underneath a covered bridge that links Morris House of Marlborough College to the North Block of the same establishment. The college is an independent boarding school established in 1843 using some of the buildings that remained after the demise the coaching trade, which saw the original Castle Inn Coaching House close. The route continues westward through the village of Fyfield, across Overton Hill where there is a parking area at the start of the Ridgeway National Trail and through the village of West Kennet. On leaving West Kennet there are some parking lay-bys where visitors can walk a short distance from the road to the Neolithic West Kennet Long Barrow, which forms part of the Avebury World Heritage Site. One mile further along the A4 is Silbury Hill, which is also part of the Avebury World Heritage Site. A purpose built car park is located beyond the hill on the right travelling westward. As the route approaches the Beckhampton roundabout, which forms the intersection with the A361, it passes by the Waggon & Horses Inn, built in 1669 to profit from the increasing trade along the old Bath Road. It is mentioned in The Pickwick Papers novel by Charles Dickens. Cherhill White Horse as seen from the A4 The route continues past Cherhill and the Cherhill White Horse can be seen to the left and nearby the Lansdowne Monument. The route then descends down the Labour in Vain Hill through the village of Quemerford and into the market town of Calne. Heading towards the town centre, the road crosses a double mini roundabout, one exit forming the junction with the A3102 to Melksham. It follows New Road and passes by the old coaching inn of the Lansdowne Strand. On the way out of Calne, the road goes along Curzon Street, and then to Chilvester Hill at the roundabout where the northern part of the A3102 splits off towards Lyneham. The A4 descends steeply before climbing again up Black Dog Hill past the Bowood House Estate. The old road used to pass through Derry Hill, but the New Road, as it is called at this point, indicates that the village was bypassed. There follows a steep descent to the junction with the A342 Devizes road and a sharp right turn past the Lysley Arms towards Chippenham. On the outskirts of Chippenham is a large roundabout, where the old A4 used to carry straight on down London Road and The Causeway into the Town Centre, which has since been pedestrianised. Most traffic turns left to go round the Pewsham Estate relief road called Pewsham Way, which is now the classified A4 route. After four roundabouts, the A4 turns left in a southerly direction at a roundabout, past the Chippenham Magistrates Court. The route heads downhill over the River Avon on the Avenue La Fleche, named after one of Chippenham's twin towns, to the Bridge Centre roundabout. =Chippenham to Bath (12.7 miles)= The Paragon, Bath The Bridge Centre roundabout forms a junction of the A4 with the A420 Bristol Road. The route heads over Rowden Hill past the Chippenham Community Hospital and down to the spot where musician Eddie Cochran was killed in a car crash on 17 April 1960. A plaque has been placed there in remembrance. From there it passes under the railway arch built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in the 1830s and on to its junction with the A350. From this point onwards it regains its trunk road status and heads up Chequers Hill towards Corsham. The road passes through Pickwick, which used to be a village in its own right. Charles Dickens stayed at the Hare & Hounds Inn and used the village name for the title of his novel The Pickwick Papers. After a series of roundabouts the A4 continues uphill, past what used to be the Ministry of Defence Naval Operations site at Copenacre (now a housing development) before descending steeply to the village of Box. From the road the Box Tunnel, built as part of the Great Western Railway, can be seen clearly. The road bears to the right at the junction with the A365 to Melksham, and criss-crosses with the main railway line as far as the roundabout at Bathford which forms a junction with the A363 towards Bradford-on-Avon. The road after this roundabout becomes a dual carriageway until the A4 diverts to the left down a slip road, and the remainder becomes the A46; this section, the ¬£45 million dual-carriageway Batheaston/Swainswick Bypass, opened in summer 1996, was highly controversial both at planning and at construction stages. The route enters the outskirts of Bath passing by the training grounds of Bath RFC. After a series of traffic light controlled junctions, the A4 continues straight ahead where it meets the A36. It passes Hedgemead Park and down The Paragon before crossing into George Street and to Queen Square. =Bath to Bristol/Avonmouth (19.6 miles)= A4 passing under the Clifton Suspension Bridge In the original 1922 road numbering list, the A4 ended at the junction between George Street and Milsom Street in Bath. On 1 April 1935, it was extended over the A431 and B4044 to Newbridge, and the A36 to Avonmouth.The National Archives file MT39/241 and MT39/246 From Queen Square, Bath, the A4 carries on to Queen Square Place and Charlotte Street, before heading along the Upper Bristol Road by Royal Victoria Park to Newbridge Road. The road crosses the River Avon on its way to join the A36 and becomes a dual carriageway again until the roundabout that forms the junction with the A39 Wells Road at the Globe Inn and exit for the nearby Bath Spa University. It continues on through the village of Saltford towards Keynsham where a roundabout splits the road and the A4 continues as a dual carriageway by-passing the town, crossing over the River Chew in the process. The end of the by-pass coincides with the junction of the Avon Ring Road, the A4174. The route goes through the suburb of Brislington, going past Arnos Court Park and Arnos Vale Cemetery. The road runs over a bridge over the New Cut and into Temple Gate where Bristol Temple Meads railway station is located. The A4 no longer has a defined route from this point to the start of Anchor Road at The Centre; originally it went along Victoria Street and Baldwin Street before turning left onto St Augustine's Parade or, later, Broad Quay, but in more recent times it followed Redcliffe Way, via Redcliffe Roundabout (junction with the A38) across Queen Square to The Centre. From there it turns back towards Bristol Harbour via Anchor Road past the We The Curious science museum. After another roundabout the A4 follows along Hotwell Road and around a one-way system that merges the A4 with the A3029. At this point the A4 regains trunk road classification and passes under the Clifton Suspension Bridge along the Portway. It heads out of the city into the suburbs of Sea Mills and Shirehampton before going under the M5 to end at the roundabout that feeds the motorway, the M49 and A403 in Avonmouth.

Fingerpaint is a kind of paint intended to be applied with the fingers; it typically comes in pots and is used by small children, though it has occasionally been used by adults either to teach art to children, or for their own use. Finger paint for education and therapy American educator Ruth Faison Shaw is credited with introducing fingerpainting as an art education medium. She developed her techniques in Rome, Italy, before patenting a safe non-toxic paint in 1931. After developing her expressive medium for children, Shaw devoted her attention to the therapeutic benefits of finger-painting. At the request of Carl Menninger, she taught at the Southard School at the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kansas, United States. Later she served as a consultant to the Department of Psychiatry at Memorial Hospital at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While working at Memorial Hospital, she met psychologist, John Thomas Payne. Payne became her successor in 1969 and continued her work until his death in 2000. Today Shaw and Payne's work continues at the Shaw School and Studio in Durham, NC. Founder and director, Bryan Carey apprenticed with Payne from 1986 to 1993. At the suggestion of Payne, Carey devoted an additional seven years to the study of Shaw as an historical figure‚Äîartist, teacher and therapist. Carey and his prot√©g√©e Jennifer Falchi continue the Shaw-Payne tradition by traveling and teaching their method of artistic self-expression and emotional healing to people of all ages and abilities.  Technique  Adults fingerpainting Although the name implies that the paint is applied with the fingers, expert use of this medium makes use of the hands and lower arms too. Use of the entire arm smooths the paint on the paper prior to more detailed modeling with the fingers and other parts of the hand. Sometimes sponges, cloth, and other tools are used to obtain a specific texture. Some artists are known to solely paint with their hands, as a way to become more intimate with the process. These artists do not use traditional fingerpaint. This style, \\"Reckless Art\\", is most accurately categorized as a subgenre of outsider art. Painters like Tyler Ramsey have vowed never to touch a brush, but the use of surgical gloves for safety is common when using toxic oils. Tyler Ramsey claims that, \\"Rejecting brushes gives a painter the opportunity to approach the craft from a fresh perspective.\\" \\"Reckless Art\\" started in 2002 as a way to refute the idea that \\"Everything has been done already.\\" Finger painting artist Nick Benjamin claims he \\"prefers to paint using fingers as the technique results in a real bond between the artwork and artist and allows for some intricate blending not achievable with brushes\\". Outsider artist Jimmy Lee Sudduth explained that he painted with his fingers because they \\"never wore out\\" the way brushes did. Fingerpaint treated repeatedly by means of decalcomania on the same paper tends to generate fractals, as studied at Yale University.  Materials  A child fingerpainting Fingerpaint is non-toxic and is usually sold in packages of six bright colors. The paints can also be prepared from non-toxic household products such as flour or cornstarch. Some childcare facilities use instant pudding as fingerpaint, eliminating the need to keep the children's fingers out of their mouths.

Melchora Aquino de Ramos (6 January 1812 ‚Äì 19 February 1919) was a Filipina revolutionary who became known as \\"Tandang Sora\\" (\\"Elder Sora\\") because of her age during the Philippine Revolution. She was known as the \\"Grand Woman of the Revolution\\" and the \\"Mother of Balintawak\\" for her contributions. Early life and marriage Tandang Sora was born on 6 January 1812 in Barrio Banlat, Caloocan (now part of Quezon City). Tandang Sora, daughter of a peasant couple, Juan and Valentina Aquino, never attended school. However, she was apparently literate at an early age and talented as a singer and performed at local events as well as at Mass for her Church. She was also often chosen for the role of Reyna Elena during the \\"Santacruzan\\", a processional pageant commemorating Empress Helen's finding of the Cross of Christ, celebrated in the Philippines in May. Later in life, she married Fulgencio Ramos, a cabeza de barrio (village chief), and bore six children. Ramos died when their youngest child was seven and she was left as a single parent for their children. Tandang Sora continued her life as an hermana mayor active in celebrating fiestas, baptisms, and weddings. She worked hard in order to give her children education. Involvement in the revolution In her native town, Tandang Sora operated a store, which became a refuge for the sick and wounded revolutionaries. She fed, gave medical attention to and encouraged the revolutionaries with motherly advice and prayers. Secret meetings of the Katipuneros (revolutionaries) were also held at her house. Thus she earned the names \\"Woman of Revolution\\", \\"Mother of Balintawak\\", \\"Mother of the Philippine Revolution\\", and Tandang Sora (Tandang is derived from the Tagalog word matand√¢, which means old). She and her son, Juan Ramon, were present in the Cry of Balintawak and were witnesses to the tearing up of the cedulas. When the Spaniards learned about her activities and her knowledge to the whereabouts of the Katipuneros, she was interrogated but she refused to divulge any information. She was then arrested by the guardia civil and was deported to Guam, Marianas Islands, where she and a woman named Segunda Puentes were placed under house arrest in the residence of a Don Justo Dungca.Augusto V. de Viana, \\"In the Far Islands,: The Role of Natives from the Philippinees in the Conquest, Colonization and Repopulation of the Mariana Islands. 2004:134.Isagani R. Medina, \\"Melchora Aquino Wife of Fulgencio Ramos,\\" In: Women in the Philippine Revolution, Rafaelita Hilario Soriano, ed. Quezon City: Printon Press, 1995, pp 12-13. After the United States took control of the Philippines in 1898, Tandang Sora, like other exiles, returned to the Philippines until her death on 19 February 1919, at the age of 107. Her remains were then transferred to her own backyard (now known as Himlayang Pilipino Memorial Park, Quezon City). Melchora Aquino, as depicted on the English Series 100 pesos banknote. Legacy As a token of gratitude, a Quezon City district and a road were named after Tandang Sora. Her profile was also placed in the Philippines' five-centavo coin from 1967-92. She was the first Filipina who appears on a Philippine peso banknote, in this case, a 100-peso bill from the English Series (1951‚Äì66). Tandang Sora Street in the city of San Francisco, California, USA, is named in her honor. In 2012, on the celebration of her 200th birthday, the Local Government of Quezon City decided to transfer Tandang Sora's remains from Himlayang Pilipino Memorial Park to the Tandang Sora National Shrine in Banlat, Quezon City. The city government also declared 2012 to be Tandang Sora Year. Her descendants carry different surnames, with almost all living in Novaliches and Tandang Sora districts in Quezon City as well as in Guam (USA) such as Figueroa, Ramos (her husband‚Äôs surname), Geronimo, Eugenio, Cleofas and Apo.

Career Luis Carl Russell was born on Careening Cay, near Bocas del Toro, Panama, in a family of Afro-Caribbean ancestry. His father was a music teacher, and Luis learned to play guitar, piano, and violin. He had begun playing professionally, accompanying silent films by 1917 and later at a casino in Col√≥n, Panama. He won $3,000 in a lottery and used it to move to the U.S. with his mother and sister, settling in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he worked as a pianist. He moved to Chicago in 1925 and worked with Doc Cook and King Oliver. The Oliver band moved to New York City, and Russell left to form his own band. By 1929, Russell's band became one of the top jazz groups in New York City. It had several former Oliver sidemen. Noteworthy players in his band included trumpeter Red Allen, trombonist J. C. Higginbotham, and alto saxophonist Albert Nicholas. Louis Armstrong took over the band in 1935. The band returned to Russell's name while Armstrong played in California and Europe in the early 1930s; Russell and Armstrong were reunited in 1935. They again split paths in 1943 when Russell formed a new band under his own name, which played at the Savoy and Apollo in Manhattan and Atlantic City, New Jersey. Between 1926 and 1934, Russell recorded 38 sides (mostly using his own name), plus those issued under Red Allen (1929) and a handful where Armstrong led his band. After the OKeh contract ended in September 1930, Russell recorded a handful of sessions for Melotone, Brunswick and Victor. After no recordings under his name between late 1931 and late 1934, Russell recorded a session for ARC (Melotone, Perfect, Oriole, Banner, Romeo) in 1934 which yielded six very precise modern recordings (three featured Sonny Woods's novelty vocals, one featured the vocal group the Palmer Brothers. In 1935, Armstrong took over the orchestra altogether, and for the next eight years they functioned as back-up band for Armstrong with Russell acting as the musical director. Russell led a new band from 1943 to 1948 that played at the Savoy and Apollo and made a few recordings. The most notable of those recordings was his 1946 version of the pop standard, \\"The Very Thought of You\\". In 1948, Russell retired from music and opened a notions shop, with irregular band gigs and teaching music on the side. In 1959, he visited Panama where he gave a piano recital of classical music. He died in New York City at the age of 61. His daughter, Catherine Russell, is a jazz singer.

Tomb of Xerxes I.Achaemenid soldiers Ancient copy of the cult image of a local goddess hellenized as Aphrodite at Aphrodisias The Carians (; , Kares, plural of , Kar) were the ancient inhabitants of Caria in southwest Anatolia. Historical accounts It is not clear when the Carians enter into history. The definition is dependent on corresponding Caria and the Carians to the \\"Karkiya\\" or \\"Karkisa\\" mentioned in the Hittite records. Bronze Age Karkisa are first mentioned as having aided the Assuwa League against the Hittite King Tudhaliya I. Later in 1323 BC, King Arnuwandas II was able to write to Karkiya for them to provide asylum for the deposed Manapa-Tarhunta of \\"the land of the Seha River\\", one of the principalities within the Luwian Arzawa complex in western Anatolia. This they did, allowing Manapa-Tarhunta to take back his kingdom. In 1274 BC, Karkisa are also mentioned among those who fought on the Hittite Empire side against the Egyptians in the Battle of Kadesh. Taken as a whole, Hittite records seem to point at a Luwian ancestry for the Carians and, as such, they would have lost their literacy through the Dark Age of Anatolia. The relationship between the Bronze Age \\"Karkiya\\" or \\"Karkisa\\" and the Iron Age Caria and the Carians is complicated, despite having western Anatolia as common ground, by the uncertainties regarding the exact location of the former on the map within Hittite geography.. Yet, the supposition is suitable from a linguistic point-of-view given that the Phoenicians were calling them \\"KRK\\" in their abjad script and they were referred to as in Old Persian. The Carians next appear in records of the early centuries of the first millennium BC; Homer's writing about the golden armour or ornaments of the Carian captain Nastes, the brother of Amphimachus and son of Nomion,Homer. Iliad, 2.858‚Äì2.875. reflects the reputation of Carian wealth that may have preceded the Greek Dark Ages and thus recalled in oral tradition. In some translations of Biblical texts, the Carians are mentioned in 2 Kings 11:4, 11:19 (; ◊õ÷∏÷º◊®÷¥◊ô, in Hebrew literally \\"like fat sheep/goat\\", contextually \\"noble\\" or \\"honored\\") and perhaps alluded to in 2 Samuel 8:18, 15:18, and 20:23 (; ◊õ÷∞÷º◊®÷µ◊™÷¥◊ô, probably unrelated due to the \\"t\\", may be Cretans). They are also named as mercenaries in inscriptions found in ancient Egypt and Nubia, dated to the reigns of Psammetichus I and II. They are sometimes referred to as the \\"Cari\\" or \\"Khari\\". Carian remnants have been found in the ancient city of Persepolis or modern Takht-e-Jamshid in Iran. The Greek historian Herodotus recorded that Carians themselves believed to be aborigines of Caria but they were also, by general consensus of ancient sources, a maritime people before being gradually pushed inland.. Plutarch mentions the Carians as being referred to as \\"cocks\\" by the Persians on account of their wearing crests on their helmets; the epithet was expressed in the form of a Persian privilege when a Carian soldier responsible for killing Cyrus the Younger was rewarded by Artaxerxes II (r. 405/404‚Äì359/358 BC) with the honor of leading the Persian army with a golden cock on the point of his spear.Plutarch. Parallel Lives, \\"Artaxerxes\\". According to Thucydides, it was largely the Carians who settled the Cyclades prior to the Minoans. The Middle Bronze Age (MMI‚ÄìMMII) expansion of the Minoans into this region seems to have come at their expense. Intending to secure revenue in the Cyclades, Minos of Knossos established a navy with which he established his first colonies by taking control of the Hellenic sea and ruling over the Cyclades. In doing so, Minos expelled the Carians, many of which had turned to piracy as a way of life. During the Athenian purification of Delos, all graves were exhumed and it was found that more than half were Carians (identified by the style of arms and the method of interment).Thucydides. History of the Peloponnesian War, 1.4‚Äì1.8. According to Strabo, Carians, of all the \\"barbarians\\", had a particular tendency to intermingle with the Greeks, > \\"This was particularly the case with the Carians, for, although the other > peoples were not yet having very much intercourse with the Greeks nor even > trying to live in Hellenic fashion or to learn our language ... yet the > Carians roamed throughout the whole of Greece serving on expeditions for > pay. ... and when they were driven thence [from the islands] into Asia, even > here they were unable to live apart from the Greeks, I mean when the Ionians > and Dorians later crossed over to Asia.\\" (Strabo 14.2.28) Indeed, the term barbarian was coined by Homer in reference to the Carians speaking an unintelligible language.Tuplin, C, Greek Racism? Observations on the Character and Limits of Greek Ethnic Prejudice' in G.R. Tsetskhladze (ed.), 'Ancient Greeks East and West' ' (Leiden-Boston-Cologne) 1999, 47-75 Carians and Leleges The Carians were often linked by Greek writers to the Leleges, but the exact nature of the relationship between Carians and Leleges remains mysterious. The two groups seem to have been distinct, but later intermingled with each other. Strabo wrote that they were so intermingled that they were often confounded with each other.Strabo. Geographica, 7.321 and 13.611. However, Athenaeus stated that the Leleges stood in relation to the Carians as the Helots stood to the Lacedaemonians.Athenaeus. The Deipnosophists, 6.271. This confusion of the two peoples is found also in Herodotus, who wrote that the Carians, when they were allegedly living amid the Cyclades, were known as Leleges. Archaeologists studying a Carian tomb in Milas, Be√ßin. Language The Carian language belongs to the Luwic group of the Anatolian family of languages. Other Luwic languages besides Luwian proper are Lycian and Milyan (Lycian B). Although the ancestors of Carian and Lycian must have been very close to Luwian, it is probably incorrect to claim that they are linear descendants of Luwian.. It is possible that the speakers of Proto-Carian, or the common ancestor of Carian and Lycian, supplied the elites of the Bronze Age kingdom of Arzawa, the population of which partly consisted of Lydians.. An important evidence of the Carians' own belief in their blood ties and cultural affinity with the Lydians and Mysians is the admittance, apart from theirs, exclusively of Lydians and Mysians to the temple of the \\"Carian Zeus\\" in their first capital that was Mylasa. Religion One of the Carian ritual centers was Mylasa, where they worshipped their supreme god, called 'the Carian Zeus' by Herodotus. Unlike Zeus, this was a warrior god. It is possible that the goddess Hecate, the patron of pathways and crossroads, originated among the Carians.. Herodotus calls her Athena and says that her priestess would grow a beard when disaster pended.Herodotus. Histories, 8.104. On Mount Latmos near Miletus, the Carians worshipped Endymion, who was the lover of the Moon and fathered fifty children. Endymion slept eternally, in the sanctuary devoted to him, which lasted into Roman times. There is at least one named priestess known to us from this region, Carminia Ammia who was priestess of Thea Maeter Adrastos and of Aphrodite. Greek mythology According to Herodotus, the Carians were named after an eponymous Car, a legendary early king and a brother of Lydus and Mysus, also eponymous founders respectively of Lydians and Mysians and all sons of Atys.Herodotus. Histories, 1.171. Homer records that Miletus (later an Ionian city), together with the mountain of Phthries, the river Maeander and the crests of Mount Mycale were held by the Carians at the time of the Trojan War and that the Carians, qualified by the poet as being of incomprehensible speech, joined the Trojans against the Achaeans under the leadership of Nastes, brother of Amphimachos (\\"he who fights both ways\\") and son of Nomion. These figures appear only in the Iliad and in a list in Dares of Phrygia's epitome of the Trojan War. Classical Greeks would often claim that part of Caria to the north was originally colonized by Ionian Greeks before the Dorians. The Greek goddess Hecate possibly originated among the Carians.Walter Burkert, (1987) Greek Religion: Archaic and Classical, p. 171. Oxford, Blackwell. . Indeed, most theophoric names invoking Hecate, such as Hecataeus or Hecatomnus, the father of Mausolus, are attested in Caria.Theodor Kraus, Hekate: Studien zu Wesen u. Bilde der G√∂ttin in Kleinasien u. Griechenland (Heidelberg) 1960 Archaeology Throughout the 1950s, J.M. Cook and G.E. Bean conducted exhaustive archaeological surveys in Caria.: \\"G. E. Bean and J. M. Cook, BSA 47 (1952) 171ff; BSA 50 (1955) 85ff; BSA 52 (1957) 58ff.\\" Cook ultimately concluded that Caria was virtually devoid of any prehistoric remains. According to his reports, third millennium finds were mostly confined to a few areas on or near the Aegean coast. No finds from the second millennium were known aside from the Submycenean remains at Asarlik and the Mycenaean remains at Miletus and near Mylasa. Archaeologically, there was nothing distinguishing about the Carians since the material evidence so far only indicated that their culture was merely a reflection of Greek culture.: \\"Except in the extreme east, where it is approached from the Maeander valley, Caria seems to be almost totally barren of prehistoric remains; considering the archaeological reconnaissances that have recently been carried out here, this lacuna is noteworthy. Finds of third-millennium date are confined to a very few points on or near the Aegean coast, with the curious exception of one find-spot which seems to be near Yataƒüan at the head of the Marsyas valley. No second- millennium remains are known apart from the Mycenaean at Miletus, the Submycenaean at Asarlik (Termera) opposite Cos, and the reports of Mycenaean from the vicinity of Mylasa. It is now asserted by some scholars that the Carians were a people, perhaps Indo-European, who inhabited the interior of Anatolia and only descended to Caria and the Aegean at the end of the Bronze Age; but this is far from harmonising with the Greek tradition about them, and the writer for one finds it difficult to explain the Mycenaean in Caria (and perhaps adjacent islands) as being anything other than Carian. Our difficulty with early Caria is that we have no means as yet of distinguishing Carians; archaeologically their culture appears as little more than a reflection of contemporary Greek culture. Excavation of early Carian settlements is urgently needed.\\" During the 1970s, further archaeological excavations in Caria revealed Mycenean buildings at Iasus (with two \\"Minoan\\" levels underneath them),: \\"At Iasus Mycenaean buildings, approximately dated by the presence of LH IIIa ware, have been found below the protogeometric cemetery. Below this again two 'Minoan' levels are reported, the earlier containing local imitations of MM II-LM I ware, the later imported pieces of the Second Palace Period (AJA [1973], 177-8). Middle and Late Minoan ware has also occurred at Cnidus (AJA [1978], 321).\\" as well as Protogeometric and Geometric material remains (i.e. cemeteries and pottery).: \\"There has been much archaeological activity in Caria, and there is little doubt that the discoveries made in the last decade, when fully published, will provoke a reappraisal of Carian history at all periods. Mycenaean discoveries at Iasus and elsewhere have already been mentioned (p. 63). Protogeometric and geometric finds have also been abundant. On the coast a tomb at Dirmil produced 8th century B.C. pottery (C. √ñzg√ºnel, Belleten 40 [1976], 3 ff.) and there is geometric pottery from the settlement at Iasus, as well as protogeometric ware of a distinct Carian style from the cemetery beneath the Roman agora (ASAA [1969/70], 464 ff.). Inland, at Be√ßin, the fortified site which was presumably the precursor of Mylasa, a geometric cemetery has been excavated by A. Akarca (Belleten xxxv [1971], 1-52). These finds and the Carian geometric style are discussed by J. N. Coldstream, Geometric Greece (1977), 258-60. Since then a group of geometric kotylai from Euromus has been published by C. √ñzg√ºnel, AA (1977), 8-13.\\" Archaeologists also confirmed the presence of Carians in Sardis, Rhodes, and in Egypt where they served as mercenaries of the Pharaoh. In Rhodes, specifically, a type of Carian chamber-tomb known as a Ptolemaion may be attributed to a period of Carian hegemony on the island.: \\"Carians also made their mark abroad, and recent work sheds light on their presence in Sardis (J. G. Pedley, JHS [1974], 96-9), Rhodes (P. M. Fraser, Rhodian Funerary Monuments [1977], 5, a chamber-tomb of Carian type known as the Ptolemaion, probably belonging to the period of Carian hegemony in the island for which see id., BSA [1972], 122-3), and above all in Egypt as mercenaries in the Pharaonic armies (O. Masson, Bull. Soc. Fr. d'Egyptologie lvi [1969], 25-36; A. B. Lloyd, JEA [1978], 107-10).\\" Despite this period of increased archaeological activity, the Carians still appear not to have been an autochthonous group of Anatolia since both the coastal and interior regions of Caria were virtually unoccupied throughout prehistoric times.: \\"J. M. Cook, after his thorough and exhaustive survey of the area with G. Bean, doubts that the Carians occupied Caria during the second millennium B.C. for, with the exception of Miletus, and Mylasa with its scanty Mycenaean remains, \\"the coast appears a blank on the map...and the interior of Caria seems to have been virtually uninhabited throughout prehistoric times. Paton and Myres had previously suggested that the lack of Mycenaean remains in Caria, within sight of so many islands which were occupied by Mycenaeans, must have been due to some unknown mainland opposition.\\" As for the assumption that the Carians descended from Neolithic settlers, this is contradicted by the fact that Neolithic Caria was essentially desolate.: \\"That Neolithic Caria was uninhabited is quite incredible. Hacilar directly east of Caria, was a Neolithic settlement already in 8000 B.C.\\" Though a very small Neolithic population may have existed in Caria,: \\"In short, the population of Neolithic Caria may have been very small...\\" the people known as \\"Carians\\" may in fact have been of Aegean origin that settled in southwestern Anatolia during the second millennium BC.: \\"Caria, Carians A region of south-west Turkey, south of *Lydia, Caria was first settled in the *Neolithic but became a distinctive culture only in the first millennium BC. Carians may originally have been of *Aegean origin and settled in the area in the second millennium BC.

It runs for about (including sections concurrent with other designations) from London to the Irish Sea at the ferry port of Holyhead. In many parts the route follows that of the Roman Iter II route which later took the Anglo-Saxon name Watling Street. History =Roman Road= Roman Britain, with the route of Watling Street in red The section of the A5 between London and Shrewsbury is roughly contiguous with one of the principal Roman roads in Britain: that between Londinium and Deva, which diverges from the present-day A5 corridor at Wroxeter (Viroconium Cornoviorum) near Shrewsbury. =Telford's Holyhead Road= The Act of Union 1800, which unified Great Britain and Ireland, gave rise to a need to improve communication links between London and Dublin. A parliamentary committee led to an Act of Parliament of 1815 that authorised the purchase of existing turnpike road interests and, where necessary, the construction of new road, to complete the route between the two capitals. This made it the first major civilian state-funded road building project in Britain since Roman times. Responsibility for establishing the new route was awarded to the famous engineer, Thomas Telford. Through England, the road largely took over existing turnpike roads and mainly following the route of the Anglo-Saxon W√¶celinga Str√¶t (Watling Street), much of which had been historically the Roman road Iter II. However between Weedon, Northamptonshire and Oakengates, Telford's Holyhead Road eschews the Watling Street corridor, picking up instead the major cities of Coventry, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton; this routing being far more useful for communications. From Shrewsbury and through Wales, Telford's work was more extensive. In places he followed existing roads, but he also built new links, including the Menai Suspension Bridge to connect the mainland with Anglesey and the Stanley Embankment to Holy Island. Telford's road was complete with the opening of the Menai Suspension Bridge in 1826. Notable features of Telford's road The road was designed to allow stagecoaches and the mail coach to carry post between London and Holyhead, and thence by mailboat to Ireland. Therefore, throughout its length the gradient never exceeds 1:17 (5.9%). The route through Wales retains many of the original features of Telford's road and has, since 1995, been recognised as a historic route worthy of preservation. An 18-month survey by Cadw in 1998-2000 revealed that about 40% of the original road and its ancillary features survives under the modern A5, much more than previously thought.Telford highway to Holyhead found intact under the A5 The Independent, 5 August 2000 These features include the following: * many surviving and distinctive toll houses * 'depots' along the route, being roadside alcoves to store grit and materials * distinctive milestones at each mile - many originals having survived and been restored, others now replaced by replicas * distinctive gates in a 'sunburst' design, a few of which have survived * a weighbridge at Lon Isaf, between Bangor and Bethesda T≈∑ Nant cutting In 1997, a section of bends on Telford's road between T≈∑ Nant and Dinmael was by-passed by a modern cutting. However, investigation in 2006 revealed that the rock face in the cutting had become unstable, and the A5 was closed from the end of May 2006.Closure Of A5 Trunk Road Between Ty Nant And Dinmael Traffic was diverted onto the old A5 route, on a stretch known as the Glyn Bends, while the rock face was made safe. This involved the removal of 230,000 tonnes of rock and alluvial deposits. In July 2007, the A5 through the reconstructed cutting was reopened.A5 at Ty Nant reopens ahead of schedule Route =London - Milton Keynes= Starting at Marble Arch in London, the A5 runs northwest on the Edgware Road through Kilburn and Cricklewood. The A5 number disappears at the A41 near Edgware but the original road continues as the A5183 through Elstree, Radlett, St Albans, Redbourn and Dunstable. A few miles north of Dunstable, the A5 regains its identity at the M1 motorway junction 11A, rejoining the old Roman Road and passing through Hockliffe before becoming a dual carriageway as it approaches Milton Keynes. =Milton Keynes - Hinckley= On entering the Borough of Milton Keynes, the road becomes an (almost) fully grade-separated dual carriageway and passes through Milton Keynes. This stretch was opened in 1980, replacing the original route along Watling Street. From just north of MK, after entering Northamptonshire, the road resumes as a single carriageway that continues through Towcester where it crosses the A43 dual carriageway just north of the town. The road accompanies the Grand Union Canal and the M1 motorway through the Watford Gap. It then bridges the M45 motorway and continues to Kilsby. As it passes close to Rugby, the road is diverted slightly around the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal and then passes the remains of the Rugby Radio Station. The next phase north-west-bound takes it under the M6 motorway and passing close to Lutterworth. Along this stretch, the road frequently alternates between being a single and a dual carriageway. After meeting the M69 motorway at a roundabout, with the motorway passing above, the A5 runs between Nuneaton and Hinckley. =Hinckley - Shrewsbury= After this section the road continues to run through the northern fringes of Nuneaton and then on to Tamworth. At Tamworth, the road follows a more recent dual carriageway bypass, permitting the original alignment to become a local road in the town. From this point the road is a grade separated dual carriageway up until its junction with the A38 and M6 toll. After this junction it passes just to the south of Cannock and then enters Telford, where it loses its identity and route-shares with the M54 motorway from junction 5. At junction 7 the motorway ends and the A5 continues to Shrewsbury as dual carriageway, on its new alignment. (The original route through Telford, and then via Atcham to Shrewsbury, is unclassified through Oakengates and as the B5061 through Wellington and the B4380 through Atcham). Continuing from the end of the M54, the route runs around Shrewsbury as the town's southern bypass (still as dual carriageway), combining for a stretch with the A49. (The route once ran through the town, but was first bypassed in the 1930s, then by-passed again in the early 1990s). =Shrewsbury - Bangor= After Shrewsbury the A5 continues as single-carriageway except for the Nesscliffe bypass. It then multiplexes with the major South Wales North Wales road A483 and forms part of the Oswestry bypass, running to the east of that town. Shortly after, it crosses the River Ceiriog and enters Wales to continue from Chirk. The A5 continues through Snowdonia via Llangollen, Corwen, Capel Curig and through the centre of Bangor. =Bangor - Holyhead= From Bangor the road crosses the Menai Suspension Bridge to Anglesey and then runs roughly parallel to the A55 expressway to the outskirts of the village of Valley where the A5 continues onto the Stanley Embankment. The A5 from Valley to Holyhead is named London Road running through to the Port of Holyhead. The A5 traditionally terminated at Admiralty Arch (1822‚Äì24) on Salt Island, which was designed by Thomas Harrison to commemorate a visit by King George IV in 1821 en route to Ireland and marks the zenith of Irish Mail coach operations. The A5 currently terminates at the junction of the A55 near the Port of Holyhead. Alternative routes Parts of the A5 have been replaced by sections of the M1 north of London, the M54 through Telford, the M6, and the M6 Toll. The A55 route in North Wales is now the usual way to get from Chirk to Holyhead, avoiding the mountainous A5 route through Snowdonia and instead going via the much gentler Cheshire Plain and along the coast. Road safety In June 2008, a stretch of the A5 between Daventry and Rugby was named as the most dangerous road in the East Midlands.Highest risk road sections in each UK Government Office Region (2004-2006) This single carriageway stretch had fifteen fatal and serious injury collisions between 2004 and 2006, and was rated as 'red'‚Äîthe second highest risk band‚Äîin the EuroRAP report publish by the Road Safety Foundation.

Born in Sainte-Anne-de-Prescott, Ontario, Charpentier's career included diplomatic, political and bureaucratic positions, but his first love had been journalism ever since he began his reporting career at Montreal's Le Devoir in 1915, during which he earned $20 a week. In 1918, Charpentier joined the Canadian army, but the war ended before he could be sent overseas. He stayed in the army after the Armistice to work in a military hospital on the campus of McGill University in Montreal. Charpentier began covering Parliament for Ottawa's Le Droit (the city's largest newspaper) in 1922. He got the job because his father built Le Droit's first offices. The newspaper sent him to law school in Toronto for two academic years before he began his parliamentary reporting.100-year-old journalist still writes weekly column. Mark Bourrie, Toronto Star, March 28, 1998, E1. Charpentier was the longest-serving member of the Parliamentary Press Gallery. His early stories on the then-unilingual English environment of Parliament were believed to be instrumental in getting federal authorities to increase the visibility of French in the Canadian public service. Over the course of his career, Charpentier also wrote for Montreal's La Presse and Quebec City's Le Soleil. He was also head of the French section of the Canadian Censorship Branch through most of the Second World War, assuming full control of the Censorship Branch in January 1945, when chief censor Wilfrid Eggleston resigned. He was appointed editor-in-chief of Le Droit following his diplomatic career in 1968 at the age of 71. His resume included serving as a media spokesman for ambassador Georges Vanier in Paris and working as a diplomatForeign Affairs and International Trade Canada Complete List of Posts from 1946 until 1968 in some francophone African nations and South America. While serving in Africa, Charpentier met Dr. Albert Schweitzer and became an advocate for his work. Charpentier was still writing weekly columns on his trusty typewriter for Le Droit until 1999, when he had to stop due to chronic bronchial pneumonia at the age of 101. The Canadian Parliamentary Press gallery held a celebration for him shortly after Charpentier's retirement. In 1978, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Officer in 1998. He died at age 103 of pneumonia on February 6, 2001. Charpentier served on the Ottawa Board of Control, and ran for mayor in 1935, but lost.

However, since dance is a transient art, it is inherently difficult for archeologists to find and evaluate evidence of its role. There is little material information left behind, beyond a few paintings on murals and vases. This lack of direct evidence leads to several different archaeological interpretations. Dance was a central component of social, religious, and political endeavors for the ancient Maya. The entire community danced, including kings, nobles, and common people. Dance served many functions such as creating sacred space, closing the gap between here and the otherworld, and releasing the dead from the grasp of the Xibalbans (see Xibalba). Overview Dance from pre-Columbian Maya culture still exists in various altered forms today. However, dancing in the ancient world carried a much deeper significance in their sophisticated culture. Records of these dances have come to light through various murals, codices, and especially the Spaniards who first recorded their observations. Spirits of the super-natural world and their relationship with Maya culture played an important role in ritual dance. Just as well, beasts were usually mimicked in ceremonial dance. The attire worn to some dances as depicted in murals show the links Maya dancers make to the natural world and to their worshipped gods who often took the form of animals. This is evident especially in the frescoes of Bonampak. The elements as well were worshipped through Maya dance. In the Tzutujil Maya culture, it was believed that a spirit controlled the power of volcanoes. When the mountain began to grumble and shake, the Tzutujil priests would pick young women and girls who would partake in a large dance ceremony before being sacrificed into the burning mountain. Maya dance rituals often included sacrifice. For instance, the Tun-teleche¬¨ dance included victims whose hearts were removed before they died as a gift to underworld demons. On the other hand, some public ritual dances were even erotic in nature. Common throughout most all dances though was the importance of deities and the relationship between man and god. Dancing includes many different aspects of other rituals into the moves and actions they do during them. Blood-letting was used to help demonstrate the bravery of the warriors. They would also put their captives in their dances; the captives would be killed in a public ritual normally after the bloodletting. Ball games were also involved in dances. Some ball players would be in similar positions as dancers' sometimes confusing people analyzing them . Instruments were also including in depictions of ball games further supporting the connection of dancing, ball games, and warfare are connected in the life style as they all share very similar depictions of what they are. In the book of creation, Popol Vuh, it is recounted that the dances of the Twin Brothers were part of a miracle ceremony. Just as well, the dances of 'The Armadillo', 'the Poorwill', and 'the Weasel' pleased the lords of death immensely. Dance in Maya culture has also acted as a bridge between the ancient and post-Columbian eras. Spanish missionaries and lords as late as the 18th century were trying to eliminate the practice of ancient dance; however, natives maintained roots with their ancestors by practicing in secret. Even after the relatively complete conversion to Catholicism after the Spanish influence arrived, Maya people still respect their ancient deities through ceremonial dance, which has persisted through the generations since the golden age of ancient Maya. Research In 1966, Michael D. Coe and Elizabeth P. Benson described a dancing scene showing several important lords standing with one heel raised. In 1992, Nikolai Grube deciphered the glyph for ‚Äúdance‚Äù (read as ak ºot) in Maya script. Some interesting depictions of Maya dance of the Classic era are found on Maya ceramics and in the famous murals of Bonampak. The word was in a picture that depicts Bird Jaguar IV, a Yaxchilan ruler, in a pose that would be described as dancing holding a writhing snake. The words around the man read chan chan or ‚Äúcelestial snake‚Äù. Many of the texts or stelae would be installed on places that the performance the picture had captured would be ideally done at like platforms, plazas or stairways.Looper, George, Matthew. (2009) To Be Like Gods, Dancing in Ancient Maya Civilization. University of Texas Press, Dancing on designs has been hard to find at first. It has been discovered that pictures of people dancing have been found to be standing still in the pictures or with a leg raised and just barely touching the ground. The physical location of where the image is gives hints to its reason. Symbols around and in the image also give helpful hints to the decoding of the image. Some depictions of dances come in a story like format around temples, like the 40 days after Bird Jaguar IV's accession which spans many panels and includes a few different temples. Technique Ancient Maya dance is often characterized by transformations of human beings into supernatural (god like) beings by means of visionary trance. Some think that hallucinogenic drugs or medicines were used to put the performer into an altered state of mind. Once in this state of mind the participants were transformed into their wayob or soul companions. These soul companions were depicted through the masks and the costumes people wore in the dance. Some scenes are painted on pottery such as that from the myriad ritual meals of Classic festivals. These vessels depict humans, both kings and nobles, dressed in costumes. Their human faces are shown in cutaway view inside the costumes of the fantastic creatures they have become through the transformation of the dance. Some of these wayob are recognizable as animals like jaguars and birds of prey, but others just look like strange monsters. For the Maya, dance was a very public affair. It induced visionary trances where either individuals or groups went into an altered state of mind that allowed them to communicate with the other world. Those who were strong enough to travel there, told stories about how the land had things like rivers and trees in this world. Some of the great lords depicted themselves dancing out over the abyss that leads into the otherworld. The distinction between the humans and supernatural beings was never sharply made. Through dance, people became gods and gods became people even if it were only for a moment. It is important to note that these were more than just acts of civic pride or piety. They were considered to be direct connections to the otherworld. With the written form of dance poses play a big part on how they describe and depict the dance. The gesture of holding the double headed serpent would be described as a gesture of concentration, calm and tranquility. The pose to dancing was discovered to be a lifted heel while still touching the ground. This was discovered in 1911 but wasn't brought to questions till 1981 by Virginia Miller who defined the pose. This pose was started in the Early Classic period on a small scale while in the eight century started to appear in large scale depiction. This pictures show one heel raised, very rarely is both raised, and the arms in a dynamic pose with the body gazing outwards.  Writing of dance  The ‚Äústepping‚Äù pose is also closely connected to dance. This pose is a profile of the person with their right foot on the ground while the left is bent with the ball if the foot on the ground. This pose uses much context to discover the meaning. This pose could also be used for walking but the presence of instruments and dance costumes distinguish the two from each other. The legs aren't the only part of the body that mattered when it comes to dance poses. The arm and elbow were used while the hand and fingers are not always shown while almost all people are shown with arms. One dance position of the arms is the arms out towards the way the person is facing or next to the face while another one is a hand by the head with the other on the hip. The arms would be used of the artist didn't want to raise the heel of the person while still giving the symbol of dance. The use of just arms as a form of dance is used to show the dancing of someone who isn't normally a dancer, like a baby or a god. With all things there are situations that break the pattern. If the poses for dance are used without certain contexts the meanings of these poses changes. A lifted heel without instruments or dance costumes could be used to describe drunkenness. Warriors and battles also use this pose as a sign to capture enemies as well as to signal a spear being thrown. Meanings within dances The Snake Dance was also celebrated by the lords of Palenque. This time the dance was done with a male who has an ax in one hand and a serpent in the other, and a woman who is grasping the lower body of the snake. These dancers wore costumes of First father and First Mother, the deities whose actions enabled the final creation and the birth of all the gods. This depiction is thought to point toward the role of dance in the story of Creation. The most important instrument of Mayan music is the rain stick. The story of the Popol Vuh exhibits examples of this idea. After the Hero Twins are killed they come back to life as vagabonds and quickly enchant the people of Xibalba with their dancing and magic. The Twins danced such dances as the Dance of the Poorwill, the Weasel and the Armadillo and they are able to bring things back to life. All of this fame caught the attention of the Lords of Death who command the Twins to perform. As the twins perform, the Lords are amazed by their powers and finally ask the Twins to sacrifice them. The Twins do, but this time they do not bring them back to life, limiting the Xibalbans power over humans forever. Dancers are very specific on where they do their rituals. Certain dances are more private while other are public events that fill stadiums. One Spanish explorer describes a performance he watched as eight hundred heavy warriors danced in a giant stadium. Not one of the warriors were off beat as they danced all day with food and drink brought to them as they danced. Diego Garcia de Palacio compared a courtyard enclosed by stairways in Copan to the Colosseum in Rome. Dances were mostly public rituals showing community by people being different social classes on stage. These stages were normally large centers, public zones or palace compounds which the elites would use more. Much of Mayan ceremonial architecture contains pieces of art containing figures doing ritual dances. The architect of these building holds figures of what the rooms are normally used for. Some set of staircase contain pictures of captives walking down them giving the idea the rooms here were used to store prisoners. The East Court of the Acropolis in Copan is believed to have been used for dance rituals. The room was used by a dictionary of colonial Yucatec described the acropolis as a community house where they learned to discuss public interest and well as learn to dance.

It runs from Luton in Bedfordshire to Carlisle in Cumbria, although it formerly started at a junction with the A1 at Barnet. It is the fourth longest numbered road in Britain; only the A1, A38 and A30 are longer. Running north-west from Luton, the road passes through Bedford, bypasses Rushden, Kettering and Market Harborough, continues through Leicester, Loughborough, Derby and Matlock before passing through the Peak District to Bakewell, Buxton, Stockport, Manchester, Salford, Pendleton, Irlams o' th' Height, Pendlebury, Swinton, Wardley, Linnyshaw, Walkden, Little Hulton, Westhoughton, Chorley, Preston, Lancaster, Kendal and Penrith before reaching Carlisle. South of Derby, the road is paralleled by the M1 motorway; between Manchester and Preston, the M6 and M61 motorways approximate its course; and from Preston to its northern terminus in Carlisle, it is paralleled by the M6 only. Between Derby and Manchester, the A6 follows a completely different routing to the motorway network, crossing the Peak District rather than going around it. The A6 is considered to be less important than it was formerly because of these duplications. Route =Luton‚ÄìKettering= The A6 begins as a short stretch of Crawley Green Road at an elongated roundabout with the A505 roadpart of the Luton inner ring road. The A6 follows Crescent Road past Luton railway station into New Bedford Road. It meets the A5228 outer ring road at a roundabout. On the outskirts of Luton, now Barton Road, it meets the Icknield Way Path. Leaving Luton, it enters Central Bedfordshire after a roundabout with Quantock Rise. Streatley A roundabout at Streatley, where the road becomes the dual- carriageway Luton Road, passing through the Bartonhill Cutting, the road becomes single carriageway at the roundabout with the B655 at the other end of the Barton-le-Clay bypass. It meets the A507 at a roundabout at Clophill, crossing the River Flit. It passes by Maulden Wood as the dual-carriage up Deadman's Hill then passes Haynes West End. It enters the district of Bedford and bypasses Wilstead. It meets the A421 at the Elstow Interchange grade- separated junction (GSJ). The A6 meets the A5134 at a large signal-controlled junction. The road crosses the Marston Vale Line and enters Bedford as Ampthill Road. There is a roundabout with the A5141, then it crosses the railway again near Bedford St Johns railway station. It meets the A600 and A5140 at a roundabout, then passes Bedford College and crosses the River Great Ouse as King Street. It takes two one-way routes (Tavistock Street‚ÄìHigh Street and Horne Lane‚ÄìUnion Street) through the town centre, which meet at a roundabout, then continues for around 700 yards. It meets the A5141 again at a roundabout near Bedford Modern School and a large Sainsbury's supermarket and becomes the dual-carriageway Paula Radcliffe Way; it formerly passed through Clapham itself before the construction of the Paula Radcliffe Way Bypass in 2001. Clapham bypass near Oakley Irthlingborough Viaduct built over the Nene in 1936 The A6 crosses the River Great Ouse twice more, and is crossed by the John Bunyan Trail, near a GSJ for Clapham and Oakley. There is another GSJ for Highfield Parc Industrial Estate. At the end of the bypass, the road loses the broad expanse of tarmac and looks like a minor B road and becomes Bedford Road where there are speed cameras. It passes through Milton Ernest, passing the Queen's Head pub and the exit for Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre. It then continues for around three miles, passing the Falcon pub near Bletsoe then passes Sharnbrook at a roundabout. Around a mile later it crosses into Northamptonshire and enters the district of East Northamptonshire. It passes through the village of Wymington, and passes the exit to the Santa Pod Raceway, bypasses the towns of Rushden and Higham Ferrers, arriving at the Chown's Mill roundabout with the A45. From here the road bridges the River Nene and the Nene Way before bypassing Irthlingborough. The A6 then passes through the town of Finedon and intersects the A510 at a roundabout. Leaving Finedon, the road passes the Burton Wold Wind Farm and bypasses Burton Latimer and arrives at Junction 10 of the A14 at Barton Seagrave. =Kettering‚ÄìLeicester= Kettering was bypassed when sections of the east- west corridor A14 were built. The road enters Leicestershire and the district of Harborough as Harborough Road at the start of the five-mile (8 km) Market Harborough Bypass. It briefly re-enters Northamptonshire where there is a roundabout with the A427 (for Stoke Albany) and A4304 (former A427), and an exit for Great Bowden. Southern end of the Great Glen bypass looking south The road is crossed by the Leicestershire Round. There is a turn for Foxton and Foxton Locks. It is crossed by the Midland Main Line. The A6 passes through Kibworth. The road becomes Leicester Road. It crosses the River Sence and there is a roundabout. The bypass ends with a roundabout, just before the road enters the district of Oadby and Wigston. =Leicester‚ÄìPeak District= On the outskirts of Leicester the road becomes London Road. There is a roundabout with Florence Wragg Way, where the road becomes Glen Road It then becomes Leicester Road before reaching the outer ring-road (A563), next to Leicester Racecourse. It becomes London Road, where the dual-carriageway ends, and it enters the city of Leicester, passing Leicester High School for Girls. There is a crossroads, for Stoughton Road (A6030) at Stoneygate, and a roundabout with the Victoria Park Road (B568). It passes close to Leicester University and many take-away shops. It crosses the Midland Main Line near Leicester railway station. In the centre of Leicester, it is subsumed into Leicester's inner ring-road, the A594. Quorn-Mountsorrel bypass north of Leicester The A6 crosses the Grand Union Canal and the River Soar as St Margarets Way. It becomes dual-carriageway on the northern outskirts of Leicester and passes the National Space Centre in Belgrave as Abbey Lane. Later, it meets a roundabout with the A563 outer ring-road entering the borough of Charnwood. North of Leicester, as Loughborough Road, it meets the A46 Leicester Western Bypass just south of Rothley and the start of the four-mile (6.4 km) dual-carriageway Quorn-Mountsorrel Bypass. The road at this point follows the Soar Valley, and is mostly on embankment or viaduct, crossing the river four times. From here the road passes through Loughborough. North of Hathern is a dual-carriageway section which skirts the Leicestershire‚ÄìNottinghamshire border (the River Soar). The road becomes London Road and enters the district of North West Leicestershire. It passes through Kegworth and becomes Derby Road. It joins the M1 and A453 at the roundabout at junction 24, which is where the A50 Derby to Stoke-on-Trent Link begins. The road follows one of the former A6 dual- carriageway sections, passing Lockington, before meeting traffic from the south-bound M1 at junction 24a. South-bound traffic on the A6 here has to negotiate a roundabout and a set of traffic lights, which has numerous and lengthy hold-ups at peak times. The three-laned A6 overlaps the A50 for a couple of miles, and there is a junction with the B6540 (former A453). The road crosses the Trent and Mersey Canal and River Trent, where it enters Derbyshire and the district of South Derbyshire. Elvaston Castle is to the right. The road enters Derby along London Road and at Alvaston it meets the A5111 Derby Ring Road ('Raynesway). It enters Crewton and just after a hump- backed bridge it passes St Osmund's Church. There is a roundabout with Ascot Drive near the Derby Conference Centre, and the road exits as Pride Parkway, which is connected to the adjacent Pride Park Business Park and Pride Park Stadium, home of Derby County F.C.. It reaches Litchurch near Derby College's Roundhouse site; the land on which it was built was a former gas works. This section from the first roundabout to Station Approach (B6000) includes a viaduct with spans over the Midland Main Line. The A6 meets a former route beside Intu Derby, a former roundabout that was replaced with traffic lights with a multi-storey car park in the centre. The road overlaps the A601, Derby's inner ring-road and the A52, crossing the River Derwent, then leaving as King Street at an intersection on St Alkmund's Way near the former site of St Alkmund's Church. This section to the A38 has a weight limit. As Garden Street, it splits in two at an elongated roundabout surrounding a service station and a pub. At a roundabout known locally as the Five Lamps, it becomes Duffield Road.

It crosses the Peak Forest Canal and the B6062 leads to Chinley, then goes under the Buxton Line. At Furness Vale it passes the railway station and the primary school. It meets the A6015 at New Mills (Newtown) for the town centre, near the railway station and primary school, where the road enters Cheshire. At Disley on Market Street, the road passes the police station then crosses the Buxton Line near the railway station. At High Lane, the road enters the Borough of Stockport in Greater Manchester. Passing the McVitie's factory where Stockport meets Manchester Towards Stockport, the road becomes Buxton Road. In Stepping Hill, it goes near the hospital. At Mersey Square, Stockport just before the road crosses the M60, the road becomes Wellington Road North and crosses the Stockport to Stalybridge Line. At Heaton Chapel, there are crossroads with the B5169 (for Reddish), and the A626 joins to the right. It enters the city of Manchester just before it meets the B6178 and becomes Stockport Road.

Here the road is called Chapel Street where the original Salford Royal Hospital stands (now flats) at its junction with Adelphi Street. At the Adelphi Street ‚Äì Oldfield Road junction, its name changes to \\"the Crescent\\". Along this stretch the road passes several places of cultural interest including the University of Salford, and Salford Museum and Art Gallery, the Old Fire Station and the Working Class Movement Library. Along this stretch it also passes Salford Crescent railway station near the junction with Albion Way. It then continues as the dual carriageway Broad Street through Pendleton and past the junction with Langworthy Road (A5186). At Irlams o' th' Height it departs from the dual carriageway (where the A580 East Lancashire Road begins) at the old Irlams o' th' Height ‚Äì Pendlebury (roundabout) boundary. Beyond the Height roundabout it becomes Manchester Road through Pendlebury for a short distance passing both the site of the former Royal Manchester Children's Hospital and Hospital Road. The road enters Swinton and passes Victoria Park opposite the junction with Barton Road. Along Chorley Road the road passes Swinton Post Office and Salford Civic Centre. At this point is the town centre's crossroads with Partington Lane and Station Road which are both part of the B5231. The road heads north-west towards Linnyshaw and Walkden. The road passes under the M60 near the junction with the M61, near the Worsley Braided Interchange and Wardley Hall (home of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Salford) and enters Whittle Brook and Walkden as Manchester Road, passing the Linnyshaw Industrial Estate on the right.

Then it crosses the Manchester to Southport railway line and meets the B5236 at Wingates near St John's Primary School and the St. John the Evangelist Church. On leaving Westhoughton, the road becomes Chorley Road. At Four Gates, there is the B5239 for Aspull. It meets the A6027 roundabout close to the M61 junction 6 for Horwich. It passes through Hilton House, at Scot Lane End, it meets the B5408 for Blackrod, becoming the Blackrod By-Pass Road. It meets the B5238, for Horwich, at crossroads near Blackrod railway station. Close by on the M61 is the Rivington services (formerly Bolton West services). It rejoins the old route where it meets the B5408. Leaving Greater Manchester, it enters Adlington, Lancashire, and the district of Chorley where it crosses the River Douglas as Chorley Road, becoming Market Street. In the centre of Adlington it meets the B6227 near Adlington railway station, and the police station, becoming Church Street then Westhoughton Road. It crosses the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and meets the A673 from Bolton and A5106 from Standish. It crosses the River Yarrow and passes the Albany Science College as Bolton Road. In Chorley, the central section is dual-carriageway with many roundabouts. It meets the B6228 at a roundabout, passes the railway station, then meets the A581 and B6229. It passes a hospital and meets the B5252 at a roundabout where it crosses the railway.

There are two roundabouts for the Walton Summit Industrial Estate, either of which lead to the Walton Summit Motorway. Next is a roundabout with the M6 at junction 29, which is now shared with the M65 where the it becomes a trunk road. The road becomes dual-carriageway as it passes Bamber Bridge. There are crossroads with the northern terminus of the A49 then a roundabout with the A582 ‚Äì where the road heads north as London Way, built in the 1980s to bypass Bamber Bridge and later widened. The start of the M65 is accessible only from this roundabout at junction 1a. It crosses the East Lancashire Line and meets the B5257 at a roundabout. It meets the B6230 at a roundabout at Dog Kennel Wood, crosses the River Darwen and meets the A675 at Walton-le-Dale, where the bypass ends.

North of junctions with the B6241 Preston ring road, junction 1 of the M55 is a roundabout on the A6 connected by slip roads with the motorway above. After the motorway, a bypass opened in 2017 takes the A6 east of Broughton, where it formerly met the B5269 at crossroads; the bypass, James Towers Way, is dual carriageway as far as the roundabout where the roads now cross, and meets the former A6 at another roundabout. Through Barton, still as Garstang Road, it runs along the Preston and Wyre district boundary, converging with the West Coast Main Line and crossing the railway on a bridge. The district boundary crosses to the other side of the road and it enters the Borough of Wyre. It passes through Bilsborrow before leaving the district boundary, crosses the River Brock at Brock, and passes the site of a former railway station; a bridge carries the road over the Lancaster Canal. At Catterall, it meets the B6430 ‚Äì the original A6 route ‚Äì and crosses the River Wyre, and as Preston Lancaster New Road meets the A586 (for Churchtown).

It meets the M6 at junction 33 and goes through Galgate as Main Road, passing under the West Coast Main Line, which it then runs adjacent to. The University of Lancaster lies in the separation between the A6 and the M6, where there is a short section of dual-carriageway on the A6 alongside the West Coast Main Line. The road enters Lancaster as Scotforth Road then Greaves Road. It meets the A588 Ashton Road for Preesall at a roundabout, continues past the Royal Lancaster Infirmary on the left, then crosses the Lancaster Canal. It splits in two as it passes through the centre of Lancaster. It rejoins and splits again to cross the River Lune on the Greyhound Bridge and older Skerton Bridge. The A589 leaves for Morecambe and the A683 leaves for Caton and M6 junction 34. The road rejoins as Owen Road near Skerton Community High School and there is the B5231 for Morecambe, and a road for Halton. It crosses the Lancaster Canal and heads through Hest Bank as Lancaster Road passing Bolton Town. It crosses the Lancaster Canal and meets the A5105 Coastal Road (from Morecambe) to the left at Bolton-le-Sands. Here the road is at its closest point to Morecambe Bay. It follows the Lancaster Canal and enters Carnforth as Lancaster Road, and meets the B6254 which leads to M6 junction 35. =Carnforth‚ÄìCarlisle= Near Shap Leaving Carnforth, the A6 follows Scotland Road across the River Keer. It meets the A601(M) at junction 35a of the M6 near Warton. There is a roundabout with the A6070, and the road, which has a short section of dual- carriageway, crosses the West Coast Main Line near Yealand Conyers. It enters Cumbria and the South Lakeland district near the Lakeland Wildlife Oasis Centre and Hale Moss. Nearby on the M6 is the Burton-in-Kendal services. It passes through Hale. At Beetham, it crosses the River Bela then passes through Milnthorpe as Beetham Road and Church Street, meeting the B5282 and B6385. It by-passes Heversham as Princes Way (built in 1927) (see Heversham: A History, by Roger A Bingham, page 2), passing by Levens Hall, crosses the River Kent at the old Levens Bridge.

It briefly passes through the Lake District National Park. It crosses Borrowdale Beck (a tributary of the River Lune) and Huck's Bridge at Borrowdale, Westmorland, it enters the Eden district. Passing under the M6 at Shap The road climbs to over and heads over the Shap Fells into Wasdale where it leaves the National Park, and passes the RMC granite works. A spur of the A6 meets the B6261 and joins the M6 at junction 39. The road is no longer a trunk road and passes the Corus [lime kiln s on Hardendale Fell and enters Shap where it is crossed by the Coast to Coast Walk, and over the West Coast Line. It passes under then over the M6, then passes close to Hackthorpe Hall and the Lowther Castle Inn. It passes over the M6 near Lowther, which is near the Lakeland Bird of Prey Centre. It passes over the railway at Clifton near Penrith. There is a turn for Brougham and it crosses the River Lowther at Eamont Bridge where it meets the B6262 and crosses the River Eamont over a narrow bridge. It meets the A66 at Kemplay roundabout next to Penrith Hospital. The Roman road section south of Carlisle The A6 takes a central route through Penrith, entering the town as Bridge Lane then Victoria Road and leaving as 'Stricklandgate then Scotland Road. North of Penrith, it meets the B5305 (which heads to Wigton) at the Stoneybeck roundabout situated on a new section of the A6 built for junction 41 of the M6. The next section of the A6 is one of the most dangerous roads in the county and follows a former Roman road, having seen several deaths in the past few years. This section through Inglewood Forest in Hesket civil parish follows a parallel path to the M6, and passes through Plumpton where it meets the B6413; an old Roman fort, Voreda, at Castlesteads Farm; High Hesket which it bypasses; Low Hesket; enters the City of Carlisle near Cotehill; and meets the M6 (and the B6263) at junction 42: the start of the Carlisle bypass. Entering Carlisle, it crosses the River Petteril (near a large radio mast) then the Tyne Valley railway line. The A6 travels through south-eastern Carlisle as London Road, before finishing at Botchergate in the centre of Carlisle where it transforms into the A7 which runs out of Carlisle and across the Anglo-Scottish border terminating at Scotland's capital city of Edinburgh. Former route south of Luton The route of the old A6 south of Luton is now the A1081 for most of its length. In the initial road numbering scheme, the A6 started in Barnet where it joined what was then the A1 Great North Road. From Barnet the road went to London Colney, St Albans, Harpenden to join the current start of the road at Luton. At St Albans, the road met the then A5 at a crossroads: going north on both roads, the A5 arriving from the south-west, and leaving the crossroads north- west, and the A6 arriving from the south-east and leaving to the north-east. Nowadays that stretch of the A5 has also been renumbered so that the crossroads in St Albans is now A5183 and A1081.

The representation of jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures has a long history, with iconographic examples dating back to at least the mid-Formative period of Mesoamerican chronology. The jaguar (Panthera onca) is an animal with a prominent association and appearance in the cultures and belief systems of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican societies in the New World, similar to the lion (Panthera leo) and tiger (Panthera tigris) in the Old World. Quick, agile, and powerful enough to take down the largest prey in the jungle, the jaguar is one of the biggest felids in Central or North America, and one of the most efficient and aggressive predators. Endowed with a spotted coat and well adapted for the jungle, hunting either in the trees or water, making it one of the few felines tolerant of water, the jaguar was, and remains, revered among the indigenous Americans who live closely with the jaguar. All major Mesoamerican civilizations prominently featured a jaguar god, and for many, such as the Olmec, the jaguar was an important part of shamanism.Miller & Taube, p. 103. For those who resided in or near the tropical jungle, the jaguar was well known and became incorporated into the lives of the inhabitants. The jaguar's formidable size, reputation as a predator, and its evolved capacities to survive in the jungle made it an animal to be revered. The Olmec and the Maya witnessed this animal's habits, adopting the jaguar as an authoritative and martial symbol, and incorporated the animal into their mythology. The jaguar stands today, as it did in the past, as an important symbol in the lives of those who coexist with this feline. Olmecs, jaguars, and the \\"were-jaguar\\" Clay jaguar from Monte Alban, provisionally dated from 200 BC to AD 600. Height: 56 cm (22 inches) The Olmec civilization was first defined as a distinctive art style at the turn of the nineteenth century. The various sculpture, figurines, and celts from what now is recognized as the Olmec heartland on the southern Gulf Coast, reveal that these people knew their jungle companions well and incorporated them into their mythology. In the surviving Olmec archaeological record, jaguars are rarely portrayed naturalistically, but rather with a combination of feline and human characteristics. These feline anthropomorphic figures may range from a human figure with slight jaguar characteristics to depictions of shamanistic transformations in the so-called transformative pose, kneeling with hands on knees, to figures that are nearly completely feline. One of the most prominent, distinctive, and enigmatic Olmec designs to appear in the archaeological record has been the \\"were-jaguar\\". Seen not only in figurines, the motif also may be found carved into jade \\"votive axes\\" and celts, engraved onto various portable figurines of jade, and depicted on several \\"altars\\", such as those at La Venta. Were-jaguar babies are often held by a stoic, seated adult male. The were-jaguar figure is characterized by a distinctive down-turned mouth with fleshy lips, almond-shaped eyes, and a cleft head similar ‚Äì it is said ‚Äì to that of the male jaguar which has a cleft running vertically the length of its head. It is not known what the were-jaguar represented to the Olmec, and it may well have represented different things at different times. Jaguars and shamans An Olmec transformation figure, thought to show the transformation of a shaman into a jaguar. The jaguar also is important for shamans who often associate the jaguar as a spirit companion or nagual, which will protect the shamans from evil spirits and while they move between the earth and the spirit realm. In order for the shamans to combat whatever evil forces may be threatening, or for those who rely on the shamans for protection, it is necessary for the shamans to transform and cross over to the spirit realm. The jaguar is often as a nagual because of its strength, for it is necessary that the shamans \\"dominate the spirits, in the same way as a predator dominates its prey\\" (Saunders 1998:30). The jaguar is said to possess the transient ability of moving between worlds because of its comfort both in the trees and the water, the ability to hunt as well in the nighttime as in the daytime, and the habit of sleeping in caves, places often associated with the deceased ancestors. The concept of the transformation of the shaman is well documented in Mesoamerica and South America and is in particular demonstrated in the various Olmec jaguar transformation figures (Diehl, p. 106). Jaguars and the Maya Kukulcan's Jaguar Throne, from the Maya site of Chichen Itza Integration of the jaguar into the sacred and secular realms of the Maya is proven in the archaeological record. The Maya, whose territory spanned the Yucat√°n Peninsula all the way to the Pacific coast of Guatemala, was a literate society who left documentation of their lives (mostly the lives of the aristocracy) and belief system in the form of bas- relief sculpture on temples, stelae, and pottery. Often depicted on these artifacts are the gods the Maya revered and it is no coincidence that these gods often have jaguar attributes. As stated earlier, the jaguar is said to have the ability to cross between worlds, and for the Maya daytime and nighttime represented two different worlds. The living and the earth are associated with the day, and the spirit world and the ancestors are associated with the night. As the jaguar is quite at home in the nighttime, the jaguar is believed to be part of the underworld; thus, \\"Maya gods with jaguar attributes or garments are underworld gods\\" (Benson 1998:64). One such god is Xbalanque, one of the Maya Hero Twins who descended to the underworld, and whose entire body is covered with patches of jaguar skin. Another is God L, who is \\"the primary lord of the underworld\\" and often is shown with a jaguar ear or jaguar attire, and atop a jaguar throne (Benson 1998: 64-65). Not only is the underworld associated with the ancestors, but it also is understood as, where plants originate. In addition, the Maya's source of fresh water comes from underground pools in the porous limestone that makes up the Yucat√°n, called cenotes. These associations with water and plants further reinforce the notion of the jaguar as a god of fertility. The jaguar is further associated with vegetation and fertility by the Maya with what is known as the Waterlily jaguar, which is depicted as having water lilies sprouting from its head (Benson 1998:64-67). No doubt, the jaguar's brilliant coat made it quite desirable, however, not all were allowed to don the jaguar pelt as it became the identification of the ruling class for the Maya. Not only did Maya kings wear jaguar pelts, but they also adopted the jaguar as part of their ruling name, as a symbol of their might and authority. One such ruling family to incorporate the jaguar into their name is known as, Jaguar Paw, who ruled the Maya city of Tikal in the fourth century. Jaguar Paw I was ousted by central Mexicans from Teotihuac√°n, and it was not until late in the fifth century that the Jaguar Paw family returned to power (Coe 1999: 90). Other Maya rulers to incorporate the jaguar name include, Scroll Jaguar, Bird Jaguar, and Moon Jaguar, just to name a few (Coe 1999: 247-48). In addition to the ruling class, the jaguar also was associated with warriors and hunters. Those who excelled in hunting and warfare often adorned themselves with jaguar pelts, teeth, or claws and were \\"regarded as possessing feline souls\\" (Saunders 1998: 26). Aztec jaguar warrior, from the Codex Magliabechiano Archeologists have found a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600-900 AD), which depicts a musical instrument that has been reproduced and played. This instrument is astonishing in at least two respects. First, it is the only stringed instrument known in the Americas prior to the introduction of European musical instruments. Second, when played, it produces a sound virtually identical to a jaguar's growl. A sample of this sound is available at the Princeton Art Museum website. Tehuantepec Tƒìcuani (variously rendered) means \\"jaguar\\" in Nahuatl while tepƒìc means \\"at the hill\\". The name refers to a particular hill in southern Mexico which is believed to have been an important shrine in the jaguar cult throughout several eras of Mesoamerican history. Subsequently, the name also was applied to the isthmus in southern Mexico upon which the hill lies, as well as to the gulf on the Pacific shore of the isthmus. Tecuanes Dances Tecuanes alpuyeca Tƒìcuani (and its variants tekuani, tekuane, tecuane) means \\"jaguar\\" in Nahuatl. In the south- center of Mexico the \\"danza de los tecuanes\\" is performed in at least 96 communities. In this region jaguar dances are very popular. There are many variants of jaguar dances. Some of the most popular are the \\"tecuanes dances\\", \\"tlacololeros dances\\" and \\"tlaminques dances\\".

It is one of the largest man-made lakes in the world. Before construction, Sudan was against the building of Lake Nasser because it would encroach on land in the North, where the Nubian people lived. They would have to be resettled. In the end Sudan's land near the area of Lake Nasser was mostly flooded by the lake. Strictly, \\"Lake Nasser\\" refers only to the much larger portion of the lake that is in Egyptian territory (83% of the total), with the Sudanese preferring to call their smaller body of water Lake Nubia ( ', ). __TOC__ Description The lake is some long and across at its widest point, which is near the Tropic of Cancer. It covers a total surface area of and has a storage capacity of some of water. The lake was created as a result of the construction of the Aswan High Dam across the waters of the Nile between 1958 and 1970. The lake is named after Gamal Abdel Nasser, one of the leaders of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, and the second President of Egypt, who initiated the High Dam project. It was President Anwar Sadat who inaugurated the lake and dam in 1970. Current issues Egypt lacks the water it needs for agriculture and electricity. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, currently being constructed in Ethiopia, will most likely adversely affect the water monopoly granted by colonial powers which effectively left Ethiopia and other upstream nations out of the picture. While the Renaissance Dam will benefit Sudan and Ethiopia, it has caused tensions between Egypt and Sudan and Ethiopia. Egypt is worried that the new dam will stop the Nile River from adequately filling Lake Nasser. The water supply of Lake Nasser produces electricity, and there is concern that diminishing water flowing into Lake Nasser will adversely affect the Aswan Dam's ability to generate electricity. There are pumping stations that control the water going into Lake Nasser, and currently this project generates 10 billion kilowatt-hours of hydroelectric power each year to Egyptians. Sport and tourism Fishing for Nile perch, from both on the shore and from boats, is popular. Prior to Lake Nassar being filled, many ancient Egyptian sites were physically relocated to new locations above the lake's high water level. However, some were not relocated such as the massive fortress of Buhen which is now underwater. The relocation of the temples at Abu Simbel, one of the most recognizable ancient sites in Egypt, was the most publicized. Lake Nassar boat cruises, which include visiting the monuments and temples along the edge of Lake Nassar, are very popular. Visiting the temples at Abu Simbel is a highlight of these tours.

The character, created in response to California's 1994 passage of proposition 187, made her first appearance in Cihualyaomiquiz, The Jaguar #1 (1996).International Hero - Cihualyaomiquiz, The JaguarLaura Molina - Biography/The Jaguar The Jaguar's secret identity is that of Linda Rivera, an East Los Angeles law student. Linda lives in an alternate timeline in which proposition 187 has transformed California in to a police state ruled by right-wing fundamentalist groups, which enact the removal of equal employment and affirmative action policies. People of color are consistently denied civil rights while racist hate groups are allowed to proliferate throughout the state. Tired of seeing her people persecuted, Rivera dons the mantle of Cihualyaomiquiz, a term from the Aztec language translated as \\"Woman ready to die in battle\\" and becomes a vigilante known as the Jaguar. She is assisted by local activists groups and makes use of her fighting ability, detective skills and knowledge of the law in her pursuit of social justice. Publication history Molina first conceived the Jaguar as a response to California's proposition 187 which was designed to deny illegal immigrants social services, health care, and public education. The proposition would later pass with 58.8% of the vote before being overturned by the United States federal court.California's 1994 Proposition 187 Molina viewed the proposition as a license to discriminate and a direct attack on human rights, as explained in her 1996 introduction to the character: The Jaguar made her first published appearance in Cihualyaomiquiz, The Jaguar #1, written and illustrated in 1996 by Laura Molina, with Tom√°s Benitez assisting with additional story editing and dialogue.Molina's Cihualyaomiquiz - Calisphere The series is on hiatus, but Molina promised further installments. Fictional character history Shortly after the passing of proposition 187, the rightwing backlash brings a new attack on civil rights, equal employment and affirmative action. Soon politicians are pushing for a national proposition 187. The right wing becomes corrupted by corporate media conglomerates and super rich while racist hate groups begin to grow more vocal and violent. The dignity of minority groups is assaulted on a daily basis with increasing violence against Chicano activist groups. After witnessing the racist authority of California firsthand, Linda Rivera reclaims her heritage by reuniting with her native history. Adopting the mantle of Cihualyaomiquiz, dedicates her vigilante activities to Huitzilopochtli, the Aztec god of war. Every night she performs an ancient ritual in which copal is lit and calls upon her nahual (spirit guide) to transform into her alter ego as The Jaguar. During one of her first adventures, she is shown to have received important information from an unnamed activist group in order to steal some important legal documents. Along the way she encountered two neo-nazis in a back alley doing drugs. They attempted to overpower her, but she easily dispatches of the two of them. Before leaving she concludes the altercation by congratulating them for being so lucky, because \\"...after all, my ancestors used to eat their enemies.\\" Literary analysis Since the character's debut, the Jaguar has been interpreted and discussed in other forms.

Eric Drexler with a foreword by Marvin Minsky. An updated version was released in 2007. The book has been translated into Japanese, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, and Chinese.http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Cover.html Synopsis The book features nanotechnology, which Richard Feynman had discussed in his 1959 speech There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom. Drexler imagines a world where the entire Library of Congress can fit on a chip the size of a sugar cube and where universal assemblers, tiny machines that can build objects atom by atom, will be used for everything from medicinal robots that help clear capillaries to environmental scrubbers that clear pollutants from the air. In the book, Drexler proposes the gray goo scenario‚Äîone prediction of what might happen if molecular nanotechnology were used to build uncontrollable self-replicating machines. Topics also include hypertext as developed by Project Xanadu and life extension. Drexler takes a Malthusian view of exponential growth within limits to growth. He also promotes space advocacy arguing that, because the universe is essentially infinite, life can escape the limits to growth defined by Earth. Drexler supports a form of the Fermi paradox, arguing that as there is no evidence of alien civilizations, \\"Thus for now, and perhaps forever, we can make plans for our future without concern for limits imposed by other civilizations.\\" Nanosystems (1992) Drexler's 1992 book, Nanosystems: molecular machinery, manufacturing, and computationNanosystems: molecular machinery, manufacturing, and computation, is a technical treatment of similar material. Nanosystems addresses chemical, thermodynamic, and other constraints on nanotechnology and manufacturing. Engines of Creation 2.0 (2007) An updated version of the book, Engines of Creation 2.0,Engines of Creation 2.0 which includes more recent papers and publications, was published as a free ebook on February 8, 2007. Reception The book and the theories it presents have been the subject of some controversy. Scientists such as Nobel Laureate Richard Smalley and renowned chemist George M. Whitesides have been particularly critical. Smalley has engaged in open debate with Drexler, attacking the views presented for what he considered both the dubious nature of the science behind them, and the misleading effect on the public's view of nanotechnology.

The protest was held by Tehran merchants in solidarity with the clerics. It climaxed in a widely obeyed December 1891 fatwa against tobacco use issued by Grand Ayatollah Mirza Hassan Shirazi. Background Beginning in the 19th century, the Qajar dynasty found itself in a precarious situation due to an increasing foreign presence within Iran. Reeling from devastating losses against the Russian Empire in 1813 and 1828 as well as the British Empire in 1857, not only was the Qajar government forced to grant countless concessions to these foreign powers, but Iranian bazaaris (merchants) were left in a highly vulnerable position as they couldn't compete with the numerous economic advantages gained by merchants from Europe.Moaddel, Mansoor. \\"Shi'i Political Discourse and Class Mobilization in the Tobacco Movement of 1890-1892.\\" Sociological Forum, Vol. 7, No. 3 (September 1992): p. 455. According to the accounts of foreigners living in Iran at the time, the Qajar dynasty was highly unpopular among the populace and was perceived as having little concern for the welfare of its residents. Later accounts by British eyewitnesses suggest that the reason why the dynasty had not been overthrown sooner in the face of widespread discontent was due to British and Russian intervention that essentially propped up the shah.Keddie, Nikki. Religion and Rebellion in Iran: The Tobacco Protest of 1891‚Äì92. Frank Cass, 1966, p. 3. In 1872, Nasir al-Din Shah negotiated a concession with Baron Julius de Reuter, a British citizen, granting him control over Persian roads, telegraphs, mills, factories, extraction of resources, and other public works in exchange for a stipulated sum for five years and 60% of all the net revenue for 20 years. The Reuter concession was met with not only domestic outrage in the form of local protests, but also opposition from the Russian government.Keddie, p. 5. Under immense pressure, Nasir al-Din Shah consequently canceled the agreement despite his deteriorating financial situation. While the concession lasted for approximately a year, the debacle set the foundation for the revolts against the tobacco concession in 1890 as it demonstrated that any attempt by a foreign power to infringe upon Iranian sovereignty would infuriate the local population as well as rival European powers.Lambton, Ann. Qajar Persia. University of Texas Press, 1987, p. 223. The Tobacco R√©gie and subsequent protests Share of the Imperial Tobacco Corporation, 1890 On 20 March 1890, Nasir al-Din Shah granted a concession to Major G. F. Talbot for a full monopoly over the production, sale, and export of tobacco for fifty years. In exchange, Talbot paid the shah an annual sum of ¬£15,000 (present-day ¬£1.845 million; $2.35 million) in addition to a quarter of the yearly profits after the payment of all expenses and a dividend of 5 percent on the capital. By the fall of 1890 the concession had been sold to the Imperial Tobacco Corporation of Persia, a company that some have speculated was essentially Talbot himself as he heavily promoted shares in the corporation.Keddie, p. 38 At the time of the concession, the tobacco crop was valuable not only because of the domestic market but because Iranians cultivated a variety of tobacco \\"much prized in foreign markets\\" that was not grown elsewhere.Mottahedeh, Roy. The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran. Oneworld, 2000, p. 215. A Tobacco R√©gie (monopoly) was subsequently established and all the producers and owners of tobacco in Persia were forced to sell their goods to agents of the R√©gie, who would then resell the purchased tobacco at a price that was mutually agreed upon by the company and the sellers with disputes settled by compulsory arbitration. At the time the Persian tobacco industry employed over 200,000 people and therefore the concession represented a major blow to Persian farmers and bazaaris whose livelihoods were largely dependent on the lucrative tobacco business.Moaddel, p. 459. Now they were forced to seek permits from the Tobacco R√©gie as well as required to inform the concessionaires of the amount of tobacco produced. In essence the concession not only violated the long-established relationship between Persian tobacco producers and tobacco sellers, but it also threatened the job security of a significant portion of the population.Poulson, Stephen. Social Movements in Twentieth-Century Iran. Lexington, 2005, p. 86. In September 1890 the first resounding protest against the concession manifested, however it did not emerge from the Persian merchant class or ulema but rather from the Russian government who stated that the Tobacco R√©gie violated freedom of trade in the region as stipulated by the Treaty of Turkmanchai.Keddie, p. 43. Despite disapproval from the Russian Empire concerning the monopoly, Nasir al-Din Shah was intent on continuing on with the concession. In February 1891 Major G. F. Talbot traveled to Iran to install the Tobacco R√©gie and soon thereafter the shah made news of the concession public for the first time, sparking immediate disapproval throughout the country. Despite the rising tensions, director of the Tobacco R√©gie Julius Ornstein arrived in Tehran in April and was assured by Prime Minister Amin al-Sultan that the concession had the full support of the Qajar dynasty.Lambton, p. 229. In the meantime, anonymous letters were being sent to high members of the Qajar government while placards were circulating in cities such as Tehran and Tabriz, both displaying public anger towards the granting of concessions to foreigners.Keddie, p. 55. During the spring of 1891 mass protests against the R√©gie began to emerge in major Iranian cities. Initially it was the bazaaris who led the opposition under the conviction that it was their income and livelihood which were at stake. Affluent merchants such as Hajj Mohammad Malek al-Tojjar played a vital role in the tobacco movement by organizing bazaari protests as well as appealing to well known mujtahids for their support in opposing the R√©gie.Poulson, p. 87. The ulema proved to be a highly valuable ally of the bazaari as key religious leaders sought to protect national interests from foreign domination. For centuries the ulema played a paramount role in Iranian society ‚Äì they ran religious schools, maintained the charity of endowments, acted as arbiters and judges, and were seen as the intermediaries between God and Shia Muslims in the country. Hence if such exorbitant concessions were given to non-Muslim foreigners, the ulema believed that the national-religious community under their supervision would be severely threatened.Algar, Hamid. Religion and State in Iran 1785-1906. University of California, 1969, p. 208. Furthermore, the ulema had ties with various merchant families and guilds while holding an economic interest in tobacco that was grown on waqf land.Keddie, p. 65. Finally, as the clergy pointed out, the concession directly contradicted Islamic law because individuals were not allowed to purchase or sell tobacco under their own free will and were unable to go elsewhere for business. Later during the tobacco harvest season of 1891, tobacco cultivator Mahmud Zaim of the Kashan region coordinated with Iran's two other major tobacco cultivators a burning of their entire stock. The cities of Shiraz, Tehran, and Tabriz would subsequently develop into the most prominent centers of opposition to the tobacco concession. In May 1891 Sayyed Ali Akbar, a prominent molla (mullah) of Shiraz was removed from the city by orders of Nasir al-Din Shah due to his preaching against the concession. During his departure from Iran, Sayyed Ali Akbar met with prominent pan-Islamist activist Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, and at Akbar's request Afghani wrote a letter to the leading Shia cleric Mirza Hasan Shirazi asking the mujtahid to \\"save and defend [the] country\\" from \\"this criminal who has offered the provinces of the land of Iran to auction amongst the Great Powers.\\"Mottahedeh, p. 216-217. Though Shirazi would later send a personal telegram to the shah warning the leader about the pitfalls of giving concessions to foreigners, this personal appeal did nothing to put an end to the R√©gie. Government intervention may have helped in mitigating the hostilities in Shiraz following Akbar's removal however other regions of Iran still saw a proliferation in protests. Bazaaris in Tehran were among the first groups of people to protest against the concession by writing letters of disapproval to the shah even before the concession was publicly announced. It has been argued that this initial opposition stemmed from a Russian attempt to stir up frustration within the merchant community of Tehran. Although Azarbaijan, the north western region of Iran, was not a tobacco-growing area, it saw tremendous opposition to the concession due to the large concentration of local merchants and retail traders in the region.Moaddel, p. 460. In Isfahan a boycott of the consumption of tobacco was implemented even prior to Shirazi's fatwa (discussed below) while in the city of Tabriz, the bazaar closed down and the ulema stopped teaching in the madrasas.Algar, p. 209. The cities of Mashhad and Kirman also experienced demonstrations in opposition to the concession yet historian Mansoor Moaddel argues that these latter movements were relatively ineffective.Moaddel, p. 463. Other cities around the country such as Qazvin, Yazd, and Kermanshah were also involved in opposing the shah and the Tobacco R√©gie. Shirazi's fatwa and the repudiation of the concession In December 1891 a fatwa was issued by the most important religious authority in Iran, marja'-i taqlid Mirza Hasan Shirazi, declaring the use of tobacco to be tantamount to war against the Hidden Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi. The reference to the Hidden Imam, a critical person in Shia Islam, meant that Shirazi was using the strongest possible language to oppose the R√©gie. Initially there was skepticism over the legitimacy of the fatwa; however, Shirazi would later confirm the declaration. Iranians in the capital of Tehran refused to smoke tobacco and this collective response spread to neighboring provinces.Lambton, p. 247. In a show of solidarity, Iranian merchants responded by shutting down the main bazaars throughout the country. As the tobacco boycott grew larger, Nasir al-Din Shah and Prime Minister Amin al-Sultan found themselves powerless to stop the popular movement fearing Russian intervention in case a civil war materialized.Lambton, p. 248. Prior to the fatwa, tobacco consumption had been so prevalent in Iran that it was smoked everywhere, including inside mosques. European observers noted that \\"most Iranians would rather forego bread than tobacco, and the first thing they would do at the breaking of the fast during the month of Ramadan was to light their pipes.\\"Gilman, Sander, and Zhou Xun. Smoke: A Global History of Smoking. Reaktion Books, 2004, p. 60. Despite the popularity of tobacco, the religious ban was so successful that it was said that women in the shah's harem quit smoking and his servants refused to prepare his water pipe.Nasr, p. 122. By January 1892, when the shah saw that the British government \\"was waffling in its support for the Imperial Tobacco Company,\\" he canceled the concession.Mottahedeh, p. 218. The fatwa has been called a \\"stunning\\" demonstration of the power of the marja'-i taqlid, and the protest itself has been cited as one of the issues that led to the Constitutional Revolution a few years later. Aftermath Following the cancellation of the concession, there were still difficulties between the Qajar government and the Imperial Tobacco Corporation of Persia in terms of negotiating the amount of compensation that would be paid to the company. Eventually, it was decided that the sum was to be ¬£500,000Keddie, p. 125. (¬£61,000,000 inflation- corrected to 2018 value, corresponds to $77,600,000). While Iranians basked in the glory of impeding foreign influence into their country, the tobacco movement had far greater implications than they would even realize. Historian Nikki Keddie notes that the movement was significant because \\"Iranians saw for the first time that it was possible to win out against the Shah and foreign interests‚Ä¶ there is a direct line from the coalition which participated in the tobacco movement‚Ä¶ culminating in the Constitutional Revolution\\" and arguably the 1979 Iranian Revolution as well.Keddie, p. 131. For Nasir Al-Din Shah, the protest left him both financially handicapped and publicly humiliated. Iran was forced to contract a loan from Russia and became a debtor state. At the end of his rule, Nasir Al-Din became much more hostile towards the West, preventing any form of European education or travel.

The NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) is an aeronautical research center operated by NASA. Its primary campus is located inside Edwards Air Force Base in California and is considered NASA's premier site for aeronautical research. AFRC operates some of the most advanced aircraft in the world and is known for many aviation firsts, including critical support for the first crewed airplane to exceed the speed of sound in level flight with the Bell X-1, highest speed ever recorded by a crewed, powered aircraft (North American X-15), the first pure digital fly-by-wire aircraft (F-8 DFBW), and many others. AFRC also operates a second site in Palmdale, Ca. known as Building 703, once the former Rockwell International/North American Aviation production facility, next to Air Force Plant 42. There, AFRC houses and operates several of NASA's Science Mission Directorate aircraft including SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy), a DC-8 Flying Laboratory, a Gulfstream C-20A UAVSAR and ER-2 High Altitude Platform. David McBride is currently the center's director. On 1 March 2014, the facility was renamed in honor of Neil Armstrong, a former test pilot at the center and the first human being to walk on the surface of the Moon. The center was previously known as the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) from 26 March 1976, in honor of Hugh L. Dryden, a prominent aeronautical engineer who at the time of his death in 1965 was NASA's deputy administrator. It has also previously been known as the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Muroc Flight Test Unit (1946), the NACA High-Speed Flight Research Station (1949), the NACA High-Speed Flight Station (1954), the NASA High-Speed Flight Station (1958) and the NASA Flight Research Center (1959). AFRC was also the home of the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), a modified Boeing 747 designed to carry a Space Shuttle orbiter back to Kennedy Space Center if one landed at Edwards. Until 2004, Armstrong Flight Research Center operated the oldest B-52 Stratofortress bomber, a B-52B model (tail number 008) which had been converted to drop test aircraft, dubbed 'Balls 8.' It dropped many supersonic test vehicles, ranging from the X-15 to its last research program, the hypersonic X-43A, powered by a Pegasus rocket. The aircraft was retired and is currently on display near the North Gate of Edwards.Google Earth imagery date 26 August 2012,  Location  Though Armstrong Flight Research Center has always been located on the shore of Rogers Dry Lake, its precise location has changed over the years. It currently resides on the northwestern edge of the lake bed, just south of Edwards Air Force Base's North Gate. Visitation to the center requires obtaining access to both Edwards AFB and NASA AFRC. The Rogers Dry Lake bed offers a unique landscape well suited for flight research--dry conditions, few rainy days per year, and large, flat, open spaces in which emergency landings can be performed. At times, the Rogers Dry Lake bed can host a runway length of over 40,000 feet, and is home to a 2000'-diameter compass rose, in which aircraft can land into the wind in any direction.

NASA's predecessor, NACA, operated the Douglas Skyrocket. A successor to the Air Force's Bell X-1, the D-558-II could operate under rocket or jet power. It conducted extensive tests into aircraft stability in the transsonic range, optimal supersonic wing configurations, rocket plume effects, and high-speed flight dynamics. On November 20, 1953, the Douglas Skyrocket became the first aircraft to fly at over twice the speed of sound when it attained a speed of Mach 2.005. Like the X-1, the D-558-II could be air-launched using a B-29 Superfortress. Unlike the X-1, the Skyrocket could also takeoff from a runway with the help of JATO units. =Controlled Impact Demonstration= A remotely piloted Boeing 720 is destroyed in the Controlled Impact Demonstration. The Controlled Impact Demonstration was a joint project with the Federal Aviation Administration to research a new jet fuel that would decrease the damage due to fire in the crash of a large airliner. On 1 December 1984, a remotely piloted Boeing 720 aircraft was flown into specially built wing openers which tore the wings open, fuel spraying everywhere. Despite the new fuel additive, the resulting fireball was huge; the fire still took an hour to fully extinguish. Even though the fuel additive did not prevent a fire, the research was not a complete failure. The additive still prevented the combustion of some fuel which flowed over the fuselage of the aircraft, and served to cool it, similar to how a conventional rocket engine cools its nozzle. Also, instrumented crash test dummies were in the airplane for the impact, and provided valuable research into other aspects of crash survivability for the occupants. =Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment= A modern Skunk Works project leverages an older: LASRE atop an SR-71 Blackbird. LASRE was a NASA experiment in cooperation with Lockheed Martin to study a reusable launch vehicle design based on a linear aerospike rocket engine. The experiment's goal was to provide in-flight data to help Lockheed Martin validate the computational predictive tools they developed to design the craft. LASRE was a small, half-span model of a lifting body with eight thrust cells of an aerospike engine. The experiment, mounted on the back of an SR-71 Blackbird aircraft, operated like a kind of \\"flying wind tunnel.\\" The experiment focused on determining how a reusable launch vehicle's engine plume would affect the aerodynamics of its lifting-body shape at specific altitudes and speeds reaching approximately . The interaction of the aerodynamic flow with the engine plume could create drag; design refinements look to minimize that interaction. =Lunar Landing Research Vehicle= The Lunar Landing Research Vehicle. The Lunar Landing Research Vehicle or LLRV was an Apollo Project era program to build a simulator for the Moon landing. The LLRVs, humorously referred to as \\"Flying Bedsteads\\", were used by the FRC, now known as the Armstrong Flight Research Center, at Edwards Air Force Base, California, to study and analyze piloting techniques needed to fly and land the Apollo Lunar Module in the moon's airless environment.

From left to right: 90 mm shrapnel shell, 120 mm pig iron incendiary shell, 77/14 model ‚Äì 75 mm high- explosive shell, model 16‚Äì75 mm shrapnel shell. US scientists with a full- scale cut-away model of the W48 155 millimeter nuclear artillery shell, a very small tactical nuclear weapon with an explosive yield equivalent to 72 tons of TNT (0.072 kiloton). It could be fired from any standard 155 mm (6.1 inch) howitzer (e.g., the M114 or M198). 155 mm M107 projectiles. All have fuzes fitted. Some shells displayed in Taipei A shell is a payload-carrying projectile that, as opposed to shot, contains an explosive or other filling, though modern usage sometimes includes large solid projectiles properly termed shot. Solid shot may contain a pyrotechnic compound if a tracer or spotting charge is used. Originally, it was called a \\"bombshell\\", but \\"shell\\" has come to be unambiguous in a military context. All explosive- and incendiary-filled projectiles, particularly for mortars, were originally called grenades, derived from the pomegranate, so called because the many-seeded fruit suggested the powder-filled, fragmenting bomb, or from the similarity of shape. Words cognate with grenade are still used for an artillery or mortar projectile in some European languages. Shells are usually large-caliber projectiles fired by artillery, combat vehicles (including tanks), and warships. The shape is usually a cylinder topped by a cone, tipped with an ogive-shaped nose for good aerodynamic performance, and possibly with a tapering base (boat-tail); but some specialized types differ widely. History Solid cannonballs (\\"shot\\") did not need a fuse. However, hollow munitions (\\"shells\\") filled with something such as gunpowder (to fragment the ball) needed a fuse that was either impact triggered (percussion) or time delayed. Percussion fuses with a spherical projectile presented a challenge because there was no way of ensuring that the impact mechanism contacted the target. Therefore, ball shells needed a time fuse that was ignited before or during firing and burned until the shell reached its target. Early shells The 'flying-cloud thunderclap-eruptor' cannon from the Huolongjing The earliest record of shells being used in combat was by the Republic of Venice at Jadra in 1376. Shells with fuses were used at the 1421 siege of St Boniface in Corsica. These were two hollowed hemispheres of stone or bronze held together by an iron hoop.Hogg p. 164 Written evidence for early explosive shells in China appears in the early Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) Chinese military manual Huolongjing some time before 1395, describing hollow, gunpowder-packed shells made of cast iron.Needham, Joseph. (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 7, Military Technology; the Gunpowder Epic. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. Page 24‚Äì25, 264. At least since the 16th century grenades made of ceramics or glass were in use in Central Europe. A hoard of several hundred ceramic grenades dated to the 17th century was discovered during building works in front of a bastion of the Bavarian city of Ingolstadt, Germany. Many of the grenades contained their original blackpowder loads and igniters. Most probably the grenades were intentionally dumped in the moat of the bastion before the year 1723. An early problem was that there was no means of precisely measuring the time to detonation ‚Äì reliable fuses did not yet exist and the burning time of the powder fuse was subject to considerable trial and error. Early powder burning fuses had to be loaded fuse down to be ignited by firing or a portfire put down the barrel to light the fuse. Other shells were wrapped in bitumen cloth, which would ignite during the firing and in turn ignite a powder fuse. Nevertheless, shells came into regular use in the 16th century, for example a 1543 English mortar shell was filled with 'wildfire'. mortar with a hollowed shell from the Boshin war By the 18th century, it was known that the fuse toward the muzzle could be lit by the flash through the windage between the shell and the barrel. At about this time, shells began to be employed for horizontal fire from howitzers with a small propelling charge and, in 1779, experiments demonstrated that they could be used from guns with heavier charges. The use of exploding shells from field artillery became relatively commonplace from early in the 19th century. Until the mid 19th century, shells remained as simple exploding spheres that used gunpowder, set off by a slow burning fuse. They were usually made of cast iron, but bronze, lead, brass and even glass shell casings were experimented with.Hogg pp. 164‚Äì165 The word bomb encompassed them at the time, as heard in the lyrics of The Star-Spangled Banner (\\"the bombs bursting in air\\"), although today that sense of bomb is obsolete. Typically, the thickness of the metal body was about a sixth of their diameter and they were about two-thirds the weight of solid shot of the same caliber. To ensure that shells were loaded with their fuses toward the muzzle, they were attached to wooden bottoms called sabots. In 1819, a committee of British artillery officers recognized that they were essential stores and in 1830 Britain standardized sabot thickness as a half-inch.Hogg p. 165 The sabot was also intended to reduce jamming during loading. Despite the use of exploding shells, the use of smoothbore cannons firing spherical projectiles of shot remained the dominant artillery method until the 1850s. Modern shell The mid 19th century saw a revolution in artillery, with the introduction of the first practical rifled breech loading weapons. The new methods resulted in the reshaping of the spherical shell into its modern recognizable cylindro-conoidal form. This shape greatly improved the in-flight stability of the projectile and meant that the primitive time fuzes could be replaced with the percussion fuze situated in the nose of the shell. The new shape also meant that further, armor-piercing designs could be used. During the 20th Century, shells became increasingly streamlined. In World War I, ogives were typically two circular radius head (crh) ‚Äì the curve was a segment of a circle having a radius of twice the shell caliber. After that war, ogive shapes became more complex and elongated. From the 1960s, higher quality steels were introduced by some countries for their HE shells, this enabled thinner shell walls with less weight of metal and hence a greater weight of explosive. Ogives were further elongated to improve their ballistic performance. =Rifled breech loaders= The right Advances in metallurgy in the industrial era allowed for the construction of rifled breech-loading guns that could fire at a much greater muzzle velocity. After the British artillery was shown up in the Crimean War as having barely changed since the Napoleonic Wars, the industrialist William Armstrong was awarded a contract by the government to design a new piece of artillery. Production started in 1855 at the Elswick Ordnance Company and the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. The piece was rifled, which allowed for a much more accurate and powerful action. Although rifling had been tried on small arms since the 15th century, the necessary machinery to accurately rifle artillery only became available in the mid-19th century. Martin von Wahrendorff and Joseph Whitworth independently produced rifled cannons in the 1840s, but it was Armstrong's gun that was first to see widespread use during the Crimean War. The cast iron shell of the Armstrong gun was similar in shape to a Mini√© ball and had a thin lead coating which made it fractionally larger than the gun's bore and which engaged with the gun's rifling grooves to impart spin to the shell. This spin, together with the elimination of windage as a result of the tight fit, enabled the gun to achieve greater range and accuracy than existing smooth-bore muzzle-loaders with a smaller powder charge. The gun was also a breech-loader. Although attempts at breech-loading mechanisms had been made since medieval times, the essential engineering problem was that the mechanism couldn't withstand the explosive charge. It was only with the advances in metallurgy and precision engineering capabilities during the Industrial Revolution that Armstrong was able to construct a viable solution. Another innovative feature was what Armstrong called its \\"grip\\", which was essentially a squeeze bore; the 6 inches of the bore at the muzzle end was of slightly smaller diameter, which centered the shell before it left the barrel and at the same time slightly swaged down its lead coating, reducing its diameter and slightly improving its ballistic qualities. Rifled guns were also developed elsewhere ‚Äì by Major Giovanni Cavalli and Baron Martin von Wahrendorff in Sweden, Krupp in Germany and the Wiard gun in the United States.Hogg pp. 80‚Äì83 However, rifled barrels required some means of engaging the shell with the rifling. Lead coated shells were used with the Armstrong gun, but were not satisfactory so studded projectiles were adopted. However, these did not seal the gap between shell and barrel. Wads at the shell base were also tried without success. In 1878, the British adopted a copper 'gas-check' at the base of their studded projectiles and in 1879 tried a rotating gas check to replace the studs, leading to the 1881 automatic gas-check. This was soon followed by the Vavaseur copper driving band as part of the projectile. The driving band rotated the projectile, centered it in the bore and prevented gas escaping forwards. A driving band has to be soft but tough enough to prevent stripping by rotational and engraving stresses. Copper is generally most suitable but cupronickel or gilding metal were also used.Hogg pp. 165‚Äì166 =Percussion fuze= Although an early percussion fuze appeared in 1650 that used a flint to create sparks to ignite the powder, the shell had to fall in a particular way for this to work and this did not work with spherical projectiles. An additional problem was finding a suitably stable 'percussion powder'. Progress was not possible until the discovery of mercury fulminate in 1800, leading to priming mixtures for small arms patented by the Rev Alexander Forsyth, and the copper percussion cap in 1818. The percussion fuze was adopted by Britain in 1842. Many designs were jointly examined by the army and navy, but were unsatisfactory, probably because of the safety and arming features. However, in 1846 the design by Quartermaster Freeburn of the Royal Artillery was adopted by the army. It was a wooden fuze some 6 inches long and used shear wire to hold blocks between the fuze magazine and a burning match. The match was ignited by propellant flash and the shear wire broke on impact. A British naval percussion fuze made of metal did not appear until 1861.Hogg pp. 203‚Äì203 Types of fuzes * Percussion fuzes ** Direct action fuzes ** Graze fuzes ** Delay fuzes ** Base fuzes * Airburst fuzes ** Time fuzes ** Proximity fuzes ** Distance measuring fuzes ** Electronic time fuzes =Smokeless powders= Poudre B was the first practical smokeless powder. Gunpowder was used as the only form of explosive up until the end of the 19th century. Guns using black powder ammunition would have their view obscured by a huge cloud of smoke and concealed shooters were given away by a cloud of smoke over the firing position. Guncotton, a nitrocellulose-based material, was discovered by Swiss chemist Christian Friedrich Sch√∂nbein in 1846. He promoted its use as a blasting explosiveDavis, William C., Jr. Handloading National Rifle Association of America (1981) p.28 and sold manufacturing rights to the Austrian Empire. Guncotton was more powerful than gunpowder, but at the same time was somewhat more unstable. John Taylor obtained an English patent for guncotton; and John Hall & Sons began manufacture in Faversham. British interest waned after an explosion destroyed the Faversham factory in 1847. Austrian Baron Wilhelm Lenk von Wolfsberg built two guncotton plants producing artillery propellant, but it was dangerous under field conditions, and guns that could fire thousands of rounds using gunpowder would reach their service life after only a few hundred shots with the more powerful guncotton. Small arms could not withstand the pressures generated by guncotton. After one of the Austrian factories blew up in 1862, Thomas Prentice & Company began manufacturing guncotton in Stowmarket in 1863; and British War Office chemist Sir Frederick Abel began thorough research at Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills leading to a manufacturing process that eliminated the impurities in nitrocellulose making it safer to produce and a stable product safer to handle. Abel patented this process in 1865, when the second Austrian guncotton factory exploded. After the Stowmarket factory exploded in 1871, Waltham Abbey began production of guncotton for torpedo and mine warheads.Sharpe, Philip B. Complete Guide to Handloading 3rd Edition (1953) Funk & Wagnalls pp. 141‚Äì144 Sir James Dewar developed the cordite explosive in 1889. In 1884, Paul Vieille invented a smokeless powder called Poudre B (short for poudre blanche‚Äîwhite powder, as distinguished from black powder)Davis, Tenney L. The Chemistry of Powder & Explosives (1943) pages 289‚Äì292 made from 68.2% insoluble nitrocellulose, 29.8% soluble nitrocellusose gelatinized with ether and 2% paraffin. This was adopted for the Lebel rifle.Hogg, Oliver F. G. Artillery: Its Origin, Heyday and Decline (1969) p. 139 Vieille's powder revolutionized the effectiveness of small guns, because it gave off almost no smoke and was three times more powerful than black powder. Higher muzzle velocity meant a flatter trajectory and less wind drift and bullet drop, making 1000 meter shots practicable. Other European countries swiftly followed and started using their own versions of Poudre B, the first being Germany and Austria which introduced new weapons in 1888. Subsequently, Poudre B was modified several times with various compounds being added and removed. Krupp began adding diphenylamine as a stabilizer in 1888. Britain conducted trials on all the various types of propellant brought to their attention, but were dissatisfied with them all and sought something superior to all existing types. In 1889, Sir Frederick Abel, James Dewar and Dr W Kellner patented (Nos 5614 and 11,664 in the names of Abel and Dewar) a new formulation that was manufactured at the Royal Gunpowder Factory at Waltham Abbey. It entered British service in 1891 as Cordite Mark 1. Its main composition was 58% Nitro-glycerine, 37% Guncotton and 3% mineral jelly. A modified version, Cordite MD, entered service in 1901, this increased guncotton to 65% and reduced nitro-glycerine to 30%, this change reduced the combustion temperature and hence erosion and barrel wear. Cordite could be made to burn more slowly which reduced maximum pressure in the chamber (hence lighter breeches, etc.), but longer high pressure ‚Äì significant improvements over gunpowder. Cordite could be made in any desired shape or size.Hogg, Oliver F. G. Artillery: Its Origin, Heyday and Decline (1969) p.141 The creation of cordite led to a lengthy court battle between Nobel, Maxim, and another inventor over alleged British patent infringement. Other shell types carcass shell A variety of fillings have been used in shells throughout history. An incendiary shell was invented by Valturio in 1460. The carcass shell was first used by the French under Louis XIV in 1672.Nicolas √âdouard Delabarre-Duparcq and George Washington Cullum. Elements of Military Art and History. 1863. p 142. Initially in the shape of an oblong in an iron frame (with poor ballistic properties) it evolved into a spherical shell. Their use continued well into the 19th century. A modern version of the incendiary shell was developed in 1857 by the British and was known as Martin's shell after its inventor. The shell was filled with molten iron and was intended to break up on impact with an enemy ship, splashing molten iron on the target. It was used by the Royal Navy between 1860 and 1869, replacing Heated shot as an anti-ship, incendiary projectile. Two patterns of incendiary shell were used by the British in World War 1, one designed for use against Zeppelins.Hogg pp. 171‚Äì174 Similar to incendiary shells were star shells, designed for illumination rather than arson. Sometimes called lightballs they were in use from the 17th Century onwards. The British adopted parachute lightballs in 1866 for 10, 8 and 5 inch calibers. The 10-inch wasn't officially declared obsolete until 1920.Hogg pp. 174‚Äì176 Smoke balls also date back to the 17th Century, British ones contained a mix of saltpetre, coal, pitch, tar, resin, sawdust, crude antimony and sulphur. They produced a 'noisome smoke in abundance that is impossible to bear'. In 19th century British service, they were made of concentric paper with a thickness about 1/15th of the total diameter and filled with powder, saltpeter, pitch, coal and tallow. They were used to 'suffocate or expel the enemy in casemates, mines or between decks; for concealing operations; and as signals. During the First World War, shrapnel shells and explosive shells inflicted terrible casualties on infantry, accounting for nearly 70% of all war casualties and leading to the adoption of steel helmets on both sides. Shells filled with poison gas were used from 1917 onwards. Frequent problems with shells led to many military disasters when shells failed to explode, most notably during the 1916 Battle of the Somme. Propulsion Artillery shells are differentiated by how the shell is loaded, propelled and the type of breech mechanism: =Fixed ammunition= With this style of ammunition, there are three main components the fuzed projectile, the casing to hold the propellants and primer, and the single propellant charge. With a fixed round everything is included in one ready to use package and in British ordnance, terms are called fixed quick firing. Often guns which use fixed ammunition use sliding-block or sliding-wedge breeches and the case provides obturation which seals the breech of the gun and prevents propellant gasses from escaping. Sliding block breeches can be horizontal or vertical. Advantages of fixed ammunition are simplicity, safety, moisture resistance and speed of loading. Disadvantages are eventually a fixed round becomes too long or too heavy to load by a gun crew. Another issue is the inability to vary propellant charges to achieve different velocities and ranges. Lastly, there's the issue of resource usage since a fixed round uses a case, which can be an issue in a prolonged war if there are metal shortages. =Separate loading cased charge= With this style of ammunition there are three main components: The fuzed projectile, the casing to hold the propellants and primer, and the bagged propellant charges. With a separate loading cased charge round the casing, bagged propellant charges and projectile are usually separated into two or more parts. In British ordnance terms, this type of ammunition is called separate quick firing. Often guns which use separate loading cased charge ammunition use sliding-block or sliding-wedge breeches and during World War I and World War II Germany predominantly used fixed or separate loading cased charges and sliding block breeches even for their largest guns. A variant of separate loading cased charge ammunition is semi-fixed ammunition. With semi-fixed ammunition the round comes as a complete package but the projectile and its case can be separated. The case holds a set number of bagged charges and the gun crew can add or subtract propellant to change range and velocity. The round is then reassembled, loaded, and fired. Advantages include easier handling for larger caliber rounds, while range and velocity can easily be varied by increasing or decreasing the number of propellant charges. Disadvantages include more complexity, slower loading, less safety, less moisture resistance, and the metal cases can still be a material resource issue. =Separate loading bagged charge= With this style of ammunition there are three main components ‚Äì the fuzed projectile, the bagged charges and the primer. Like separate loading cased charge ammunition, the number of propellant charges can be varied. However, this style of ammunition does not use a cartridge case and it achieves obturation through a screw breech instead of a sliding block. Sometimes when reading about artillery the term separate loading ammunition will be used without clarification of whether a cartridge case is used or not, in which case refer to the type of breech used. Heavy artillery pieces and Naval artillery tend to use bagged charges and projectiles because the weight and size of the projectiles and propelling charges can be more than a gun crew can manage. Advantages include easier handling for large rounds, decreased metal usage, while range and velocity can be varied by using more or fewer propellant charges. Disadvantages include more complexity, slower loading, less safety and less moisture resistance. =Range enhancing technologies = Extended range shells are sometimes used. These special shell designs may be Rocket Assisted Projectiles (RAP) or base bleed to increase range. The first has a small rocket motor built into its base to provide additional thrust. The second has a pyrotechnic device in its base that bleeds gas to fill the partial vacuum created behind the shell and hence reduce base-drag. These shell designs usually have reduced HE filling to remain within the permitted weight for the projectile, and hence less lethality. Sizes British gun crew preparing 155 mm shells at Vergato, Italy on 22 February 1945 155 mm American artillery shells, March 1945 The caliber of a shell is its diameter. Depending on the historical period and national preferences, this may be specified in millimeters, centimeters, or inches. The length of gun barrels for large cartridges and shells (naval) is frequently quoted in terms of the ratio of the barrel length to the bore size, also called caliber. For example, the 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun is 50 calibers long, that is, 16\\"√ó50=800\\"=66.7 feet long. Some guns, mainly British, were specified by the weight of their shells (see below). Explosive rounds as small as 12.7 x 82 and 13 x 64 millimeter have been used on aircraft and armored vehicles, but their small explosive yield have led some nations to limit their explosive rounds to 20 mm or larger. International Law precludes the use of explosive ammunition for use against individual persons, but not against vehicles and aircraft. The largest shells ever fired were those from the German super-railway guns, Gustav and Dora, which were 800 mm (31.5 in) in caliber. Very large shells have been replaced by rockets, missiles, and bombs, and today the largest shells in common use are 155 mm (6.1 in). Gun calibers have standardized around a few common sizes, especially in the larger range, mainly due to the uniformity required for efficient military logistics. Shells of 105 and 155 mm for artillery and 105mm and 120 mm for tank guns in NATO. Artillery shells of 122, 130 and 152 mm and tank gun ammunition of 100, 115, and 125 mm caliber remain in use in Eastern Europe, Western Asia, Northern Africa, and Eastern Asia. Most common calibers have been in use for many years, since it is logistically complex to change the caliber of all guns and ammunition stores. The weight of shells increases by and large with caliber. A typical 155 mm (6.1 in) shell weighs about 50 kg, a common 203 mm (8 in) shell about 100 kg, a concrete demolition 203 mm (8 in) shell 146 kg, a 280 mm (11 in) battleship shell about 300 kg, and a 460 mm (18 in) battleship shell over 1,500 kg. The Schwerer Gustav large-calibre gun fired shells that weighed between 4,800 kg and 7,100 kg. During the 19th century, the British adopted a particular form of designating artillery. Field guns were designated by nominal standard projectile weight, while howitzers were designated by barrel caliber. British guns and their ammunition were designated in pounds, e.g., as \\"two-pounder\\" shortened to \\"2-pr\\" or \\"2-pdr\\". Usually, this referred to the actual weight of the standard projectile (shot, shrapnel or HE), but, confusingly, this was not always the case. Some were named after the weights of obsolete projectile types of the same caliber, or even obsolete types that were considered to have been functionally equivalent. Also, projectiles fired from the same gun, but of non-standard weight, took their name from the gun. Thus, conversion from \\"pounds\\" to an actual barrel diameter requires consulting a historical reference. A mixture of designations were in use for land artillery from the First World War (such as the BL 60-pounder gun, RML 2.5 inch Mountain Gun, 4 inch gun, 4.5 inch howitzer) through to the end of World War II (5.5 inch medium gun, 25-pounder gun-howitzer, 17-pounder tank gun), but the majority of naval guns were by caliber. After World War II, guns were designated by caliber. Types Palliser shot for the BL 12 inch naval gun Mk I - VII, 1886 There are many different types of shells. The principal ones include: =Armor-piercing shells= With the introduction of the first ironclads in the 1850s and 1860s, it became clear that shells had to be designed to effectively pierce the ship armor. A series of British tests in 1863 demonstrated that the way forward lay with high-velocity lighter shells. The first pointed armor-piercing shell was introduced by Major Palliser in 1863. Approved in 1867, Palliser shot and shell was an improvement over the ordinary elongated shot of the time. Palliser shot was made of cast iron, the head being chilled in casting to harden it, using composite molds with a metal, water cooled portion for the head. Britain also deployed Palliser shells in the 1870s‚Äì1880s. In the shell, the cavity was slightly larger than in the shot and was filled with 1.5% gunpowder instead of being empty, to provide a small explosive effect after penetrating armor plating. The shell was correspondingly slightly longer than the shot to compensate for the lighter cavity. The powder filling was ignited by the shock of impact and hence did not require a fuze.\\"Treatise on Ammunition\\", 4th Edition 1887, pp. 203‚Äì205. However, ship armor rapidly improved during the 1880s and 1890s, and it was realised that explosive shells with steel had advantages including better fragmentation and resistance to the stresses of firing. These were cast and forged steel. AP shells containing an explosive filling were initially distinguished from their non-HE counterparts by being called a \\"shell\\" as opposed to \\"shot\\". By the time of the Second World War, AP shells with a bursting charge were sometimes distinguished by appending the suffix \\"HE\\". At the beginning of the war, APHE was common in anti-tank shells of 75 mm caliber and larger due to the similarity with the much larger naval armor piercing shells already in common use. As the war progressed, ordnance design evolved so that the bursting charges in APHE became ever smaller to non-existent, especially in smaller caliber shells, e.g. Panzergranate 39 with only 0.2% HE filling. Types of armor-piercing ammunition * Armor-piercing ‚Äì a solid shot ** Armor-piercing ballistic capped (APBC) ** Armor-piercing capped (APBC) ** Armor-piercing capped ballistic capped (APCBC) ** Armor-piercing composite rigid (APCR), also known as High-Velocity Armor-Piercing (HVAP) ** Armor- piercing composite non-rigid (APCRNR) ** Armor-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) ** Armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) * Armor piercing high-explosive ‚Äì a mostly solid shell with an explosive element fused to detonate after the shell has penetrated the armour protection ** Armor- piercing high explosive tracer (APHE-T) **Semi-armor piercing high-explosive (SAPHE) ** Semi-armor piercing high-explosive incendiary (SAPHEI) ** Semi- armor piercing high-explosive tracer (SAPHEI-T) ** High-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) ** High-explosive squash head (HESH), also known as High-explosive Plastic (HEP) =High-explosive shells= Picric acid was used in the first high-explosive shells. Cut out section of a high-explosive shell belonging to a Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897. Although smokeless powders were used as a propellant, they could not be used as the substance for the explosive warhead, because shock sensitivity sometimes caused detonation in the artillery barrel at the time of firing. Picric acid was the first high-explosive nitrated organic compound widely considered suitable to withstand the shock of firing in conventional artillery. In 1885, based on research of Hermann Sprengel, French chemist Eug√®ne Turpin patented the use of pressed and cast picric acid in blasting charges and artillery shells. In 1887, the French government adopted a mixture of picric acid and guncotton under the name Melinite. In 1888, Britain started manufacturing a very similar mixture in Lydd, Kent, under the name Lyddite. Japan followed with an \\"improved\\" formula known as shimose powder. In 1889, a similar material, a mixture of ammonium cresylate with trinitrocresol, or an ammonium salt of trinitrocresol, started to be manufactured under the name ecrasite in Austria-Hungary. By 1894, Russia was manufacturing artillery shells filled with picric acid. Ammonium picrate (known as Dunnite or explosive D) was used by the United States beginning in 1906.Brown, G.I. (1998) The Big Bang: a History of Explosives Sutton Publishing pp. 151‚Äì163Marc Ferro. The Great War. London and New York: Routeladge Classics, p. 98. Germany began filling artillery shells with TNT in 1902. Toluene was less readily available than phenol, and TNT is less powerful than picric acid, but the improved safety of munitions manufacturing and storage caused the replacement of picric acid by TNT for most military purposes between the World Wars. However, pure TNT was expensive to produce and most nations made some use of mixtures using cruder TNT and ammonium nitrate, some with other compounds included. These fills included Ammonal, Schneiderite and Amatol. The latter was still in wide use in World War II. The percentage of shell weight taken up by its explosive fill increased steadily throughout the 20th Century. Less than 10% was usual in the first few decades; by World War II, leading designs were around 15%. However, British researchers in that war identified 25% as being the optimal design for anti-personnel purposes, based on the recognition that far smaller fragments than hitherto would give a better effect. This guideline was achieved by the 1960s with the 155 mm L15 shell, developed as part of the German-British FH-70 program. The key requirement for increasing the HE content without increasing shell weight was to reduce the thickness of shell walls, which required improvements in high tensile steel. 15 inch high-explosive howitzer shells, circa 1917 The most common shell type is high explosive, commonly referred to simply as HE. They have a strong steel case, a bursting charge, and a fuse. The fuse detonates the bursting charge which shatters the case and scatters hot, sharp case pieces (fragments, splinters) at high velocity. Most of the damage to soft targets, such as unprotected personnel, is caused by shell pieces rather than by the blast. The term \\"shrapnel\\" is sometimes used to describe the shell pieces, but shrapnel shells functioned very differently and are long obsolete. The speed of fragments is limited by Gurney equations. Depending on the type of fuse used the HE shell can be set to burst on the ground (percussion), in the air above the ground, which is called air burst (time or proximity), or after penetrating a short distance into the ground (percussion with delay, either to transmit more ground shock to covered positions, or to reduce the spread of fragments). Projectiles with enhanced fragmentation are called high- explosive fragmentation (HE-FRAG). RDX and TNT mixtures are the standard chemicals used, notably Composition B and Cyclotol. The introduction of 'insensitive munition' requirements, agreements and regulations in the 1990s caused modern western designs to use various types of plastic bonded explosives (PBX) based on RDX. Common BL 9.2 in common shell Mk V Common shells designated in the early (i.e. 1800s) British explosive shells were filled with \\"low explosives\\" such as \\"P mixture\\" (gunpowder) and usually with a fuze in the nose. Common shells on bursting (non-detonating) tended to break into relatively large fragments which continued along the shell's trajectory rather than laterally. They had some incendiary effect. In the late 19th century \\"double common shells\\" were developed, lengthened so as to approach twice the standard shell weight, to carry more powder and hence increase explosive effect. They suffered from instability in flight and low velocity and were not widely used. As at 1914, common shells 6-inch and up were of cast steel, smaller shells were of forged steel for service and cast iron for practice. They were replaced by \\"common lyddite\\" shells in the late 1890s but some stocks remained as late as 1914. In British service common shells were typically painted black with a red band behind the nose to indicate the shell was filled. Common pointed QF 12 pounder common pointed shell192x192px Common pointed shells, or CP were a type of common shell used in naval service from the 1890s ‚Äì 1910s which had a solid nose and a percussion fuze in the base rather than the common shell's nose fuze. The ogival two C.R.H. solid pointed nose was considered suitable for attacking shipping but was not armor-piercing ‚Äì the main function was still explosive. They were of cast or forged (three- and six-pounder) steel and contained a gunpowder bursting charge slightly smaller than that of a common shell, a trade off for the longer heavier nose. In British service common pointed shells were typically painted black, except 12-pounder shells specific for QF guns which were painted lead colour to distinguish them from 12-pounder shells usable with both BL and QF guns. A red ring behind the nose indicated the shell was filled. By World War II they were superseded in Royal Navy service by common pointed capped (CPC) and semi-armor piercing (SAP), filled with TNT. Common lyddite 199x199px Common lyddite shells were British explosive shells filled with Lyddite were initially designated \\"common lyddite\\" and beginning in 1896 were the first British generation of modern \\"high explosive\\" shells. Lyddite is picric acid fused at and allowed to solidify, producing a much denser dark-yellow form which is not affected by moisture and is easier to detonate than the liquid form. Its French equivalent was \\"melinite\\", Japanese equivalent was \\"shimose\\". Common lyddite shells \\"detonated\\" and fragmented into small pieces in all directions, with no incendiary effect. For maximum destructive effect the explosion needed to be delayed until the shell had penetrated its target. Early shells had walls of the same thickness for the whole length, later shells had walls thicker at the base and thinning towards the nose. This was found to give greater strength and provide more space for explosive. Later shells had 4 c.r. heads, more pointed and hence streamlined than earlier 2 c.r.h. designs. Proper detonation of a lyddite shell would show black to grey smoke, or white from the steam of a water detonation. Yellow smoke indicated simple explosion rather than detonation, and failure to reliably detonate was a problem with lyddite, especially in its earlier usage. To improve the detonation \\"exploders\\" with a small quantity of picric powder or even of TNT (in smaller shells, 3 pdr, 12 pdr ‚Äì 4.7 inch) was loaded between the fuze and the main lyddite filling or in a thin tube running through most of the shell's length. Lyddite presented a major safety problem because it reacted dangerously with metal bases. This required that the interior of shells had to be varnished, the exterior had to be painted with leadless paint and the fuze-hole had to be made of a leadless alloy. Fuzes containing any lead could not be used with it. When World War I began Britain was replacing lyddite with modern \\"high explosive\\" (HE) such as TNT. After World War I the term \\"common lyddite\\" was dropped, and remaining stocks of lyddite-filled shells were referred to as HE (high explosive) shell filled lyddite. Hence \\"common\\" faded from use, replaced by \\"HE\\" as the explosive shell designation. Common lyddite shells in British service were painted yellow, with a red ring behind the nose to indicate the shell had been filled. Mine shell The mine shell is a particular form of HE shell developed for use in small caliber weapons such as 20 mm to 30 mm cannon. Small HE shells of conventional design can contain only a limited amount of explosive. By using a thin-walled steel casing of high tensile strength, a larger explosive charge can be used. Most commonly the explosive charge also was a more expensive but higher-detonation-energy type. The mine shell concept was invented by the Germans in the Second World War primarily for use in aircraft guns intended to be fired at opposing aircraft. Mine shells produced relatively little damage due to fragments, but a much more powerful blast. The aluminium structures and skins of Second World War aircraft were readily damaged by this greater level of blast. =Shrapnel shells= Typical World War I shrapnel round: 1 shell bursting charge 2 bullets 3 nose fuze 4 central ignition tube 5 resin matrix 6 thin steel shell wall 7 cartridge case 8 propellant Shrapnel shells are an anti-personnel munition which delivered large numbers of bullets at ranges far greater than rifles or machine guns could attain ‚Äì up to 6,500 yards by 1914. A typical shrapnel shell as used in World War I was streamlined, 75 mm (3 in) in diameter and contained approximately 300 lead‚Äìantimony balls (bullets), each around 1/2-inch in diameter. Shrapnel used the principle that the bullets encountered much less air resistance if they travelled most of their journey packed together in a single streamlined shell than they would if they travelled individually, and could hence attain a far greater range. The gunner set the shell's time fuze so that it was timed to burst as it was angling down towards the ground just before it reached its target (ideally about 150 yards before, and 60‚Äì100 feet above the groundI.V. Hogg & L.F. Thurston, British Artillery Weapons & Ammunition. London: Ian Allan, 1972. Page 215.). The fuze then ignited a small \\"bursting charge\\" in the base of the shell which fired the balls forward out of the front of the shell case, adding 200‚Äì250 ft/second to the existing velocity of 750‚Äì1200 ft/second. The shell body dropped to the ground mostly intact and the bullets continued in an expanding cone shape before striking the ground over an area approximately 250 yards √ó 30 yards in the case of the US 3-inch shell.Douglas T Hamilton, \\"Shrapnel Shell Manufacture. A Comprehensive Treatise.\\". New York: Industrial Press, 1915, Page 13 The effect was of a large shotgun blast just in front of and above the target, and was deadly against troops in the open. A trained gun team could fire 20 such shells per minute, with a total of 6,000 balls, which compared very favorably with rifles and machine-guns. However, shrapnel's relatively flat trajectory (it depended mainly on the shell's velocity for its lethality, and was lethal only in the forward direction) meant that it could not strike trained troops who avoided open spaces and instead used dead ground (dips), shelters, trenches, buildings, and trees for cover. It was of no use in destroying buildings or shelters. Hence, it was replaced during World War I by the high- explosive shell, which exploded its fragments in all directions (and thus more difficult to avoid) and could be fired by high-angle weapons, such as howitzers. =Cluster and sub-munition= Cluster shells are a type of carrier shell or cargo munition. Like cluster bombs, an artillery shell may be used to scatter smaller sub-munitions, including anti-personnel grenades, anti-tank top-attack munitions, and landmines. These are generally far more lethal against both armor and infantry than simple high-explosive shells, since the multiple munitions create a larger kill zone and increase the chance of achieving the direct hit necessary to kill armor. Many modern armies make significant use of cluster munitions in their artillery batteries. Artillery- scattered mines allow for the quick deployment of minefields into the path of the enemy without placing engineering units at risk, but artillery delivery may lead to an irregular and unpredictable minefield with more unexploded ordnance than if mines were individually placed. Signatories of the Convention on Cluster Munitions have accepted restrictions on the use of cluster munitions, including artillery shells: the treaty requires that a weapon so defined must contain nine or fewer submunitions, which must each weigh more than 4 kilograms, be capable of detecting and engaging a single target, and contain electronic self-destruct and self-deactivation systems. Submunitions which weigh 20 kg or more are not restricted. =Chemical= HD (nitrogen mustard) agent at Pueblo chemical weapons storage facility ‚Äì Note the colour- coding scheme on each shell. Chemical shells contain just a small explosive charge to burst the shell, and a larger quantity of a chemical agent or riot control agent of some kind, in either liquid, gas or powdered form. In some cases such as the M687 Sarin gas shell, the payload is stored as two precursor chemicals which are mixed after the shell is fired. Some examples designed to deliver powdered chemical agents, such as the M110 155mm Cartridge, were later repurposed as smoke/incendiary rounds containing powdered white phosphorus. Chemical shells were most commonly employed during the First World War. Use of chemical agents of all kinds has been forbidden by numerous international treaties starting with the 1925 Geneva Protocol (not to be confused with the Geneva Convention), with the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention being the most modern treaty which also outlaws production, stockpiling and transfer of such weapons. All signatories have renounced the use of both lethal chemical agents and incapacitating agents in warfare. =Nuclear artillery= At a minimum the USA, USSR and France each independently developed nuclear artillery shells to provide battlefield scale nuclear weapons for tactical use. These range from the relatively small 155mm shell all the way up to the 406mm shell usable by heavy Battleship cannon and shore defense units equipped with the same guns. Follow the link to the Nuclear artillery wikipedia page with more depth of detail. =Non-lethal shells= Not all shells are designed to kill or destroy. The following types are designed to achieve particular non-lethal effects. They are not completely harmless: smoke and illumination shells can accidentally start fires, and impact by the discarded carrier of all three types can wound or kill personnel, or cause minor damage to property. Smoke Smoke shells are used to create smoke screens to mask movements of friendly forces or disorient enemies, or to mark specific areas. The main types are bursting (using a payload powdered chemicals) and base ejection (delivering three or four smoke canisters which are deployed from the rear of the shell prior to impact, or a single canister containing submunitions distributed via a bursting charge). Base ejection shells are a type of carrier shell or cargo munition. Base ejection smoke is usually white, however, colored smoke has been used for marking purposes. The original canisters typically used hexachloroethane-zinc (HC), modern ones use red phosphorus because of its multi-spectral properties. However, other compounds have been used; in World War II, Germany used oleum (fuming sulfuric acid) and pumice. Due to the nature of their payload, powder smoke shells using white phosphorus in particular have a secondary effect as incendiary weapons, though they are not as effective in this role as dedicated weapons using thermite.  Illumination  British World War II 4-inch naval illuminating shell, showing time fuze (orange, top), illuminating compound (green) and parachute (white, bottom) Modern illuminating shells are a type of carrier shell or cargo munition. Those used in World War I were shrapnel pattern shells ejecting small burning 'pots'. A modern illumination shell has a time fuze that ejects a flare 'package' through the base of the carrier shell at a standard height above ground (typically about 600 metres), from where it slowly falls beneath a non-flammable parachute, illuminating the area below. The ejection process also initiates a pyrotechnic flare emitting white or 'black' infrared light. Illumination rounds fired from a M777 howitzer Typically illumination flares burn for about 60 seconds. These are also known as starshell or star shell. Infrared illumination is a more recent development used to enhance the performance of night vision devices. Both white and black light illuminating shells may be used to provide continuous illumination over an area for a period of time, and may use several dispersed aimpoints to illuminate a large area. Alternatively firing single illuminating shells may be coordinated with the adjustment of HE shell fire onto a target. Colored flare shells have also been used for target marking and other signaling purposes. Carrier The carrier shell is simply a hollow carrier equipped with a fuze that ejects the contents at a calculated time. They are often filled with propaganda leaflets (see external links), but can be filled with anything that meets the weight restrictions and is able to withstand the shock of firing. Famously, on Christmas Day 1899 during the siege of Ladysmith, the Boers fired into Ladysmith a carrier shell without a fuze, which contained a Christmas pudding, two Union Flags and the message \\"compliments of the season\\". The shell is still kept in the museum at Ladysmith. Proof shot A proof shot is not used in combat but to confirm that a new gun barrel can withstand operational stresses. The proof shot is heavier than a normal shot or shell, and an oversize propelling charge is used, subjecting the barrel to greater than normal stress. The proof shot is inert (no explosive or functioning filling) and is often a solid unit, although water, sand or iron powder filled versions may be used for testing the gun mounting. Although the proof shot resembles a functioning shell (of whatever sort), so that it behaves as a real shell in the barrel, it is not aerodynamic as its job is over once it has left the muzzle of the gun. Consequently, it travels a much shorter distance and is usually stopped by an earth bank for safety measures. The gun, operated remotely for safety in case it fails, fires the proof shot, and is then inspected for damage. If the barrel passes the examination, \\"proof marks\\" are added to the barrel. The gun can be expected to handle normal ammunition, which subjects it to less stress than the proof shot, without being damaged. =Guided shells= Guided or \\"smart\\" ammunition features some method of guiding itself post-launch, usually through the addition of steering fins that alter its trajectory in an unpowered glide. Due to their much higher cost, they have yet to supplant unguided munitions in all applications. Image:XM982 Excalibur inert.jpgM982 Excalibur. A GPS guided artillery shell.

An anti-armor shell containing two autonomous, sensor-guided, fire-and-forget submunitions. Unexploded shells Modern 155 mm artillery ammunition ‚Äì these shells are unusual in having two driving bands. The shell on the right is a modified M107. The fuze of a shell has to keep the shell safe from accidental functioning during storage, due to (possibly) rough handling, fire, etc. It also has to survive the violent launch through the barrel, then reliably function at the appropriate moment. To do this it has a number of arming mechanisms which are successively enabled under the influence of the firing sequence. Sometimes, one or more of these arming mechanisms fail, resulting in a projectile that is unable to detonate. More worrying (and potentially far more hazardous) are fully armed shells on which the fuze fails to initiate the HE firing. This may be due to a shallow trajectory of fire, low-velocity firing or soft impact conditions. Whatever the reason for failure, such a shell is called a blind or unexploded ordnance (UXO) (the older term, \\"dud\\", is discouraged because it implies that the shell cannot detonate.) Blind shells often litter old battlefields; depending on the impact velocity, they may be buried some distance into the earth, all the while remaining potentially hazardous. For example, antitank ammunition with a piezoelectric fuze can be detonated by relatively light impact to the piezoelectric element, and others, depending on the type of fuze used, can be detonated by even a small movement. The battlefields of the First World War still claim casualties today from leftover munitions. Modern electrical and mechanical fuzes are highly reliable: if they do not arm correctly, they keep the initiation train out of line or (if electrical in nature) discharge any stored electrical energy.

The serpent was a very important social and religious symbol, revered by the Maya. Maya mythology describes serpents as being the vehicles by which celestial bodies, such as the sun and stars, cross the heavens. The shedding of their skin made them a symbol of rebirth and renewal. They were so revered, that one of the main Mesoamerican deities, Quetzalcoatl, was represented as a feathered serpent. The name means \\"beautiful serpent\\" (from Nahuatl, \\"quetzalli\\" means beautiful and \\"coatl\\" meaning snake or serpent.).Coe (1992, p.79) The Vision Serpent is thought to be the most important of the Maya serpents. \\"It was usually bearded and had a rounded snout. It was also often depicted as having two heads or with the spirit of a god or ancestor emerging from its jaws.\\" During Maya bloodletting rituals, participants would experience visions in which they communicated with the ancestors or gods. These visions took the form of a giant serpent \\"which served as a gateway to the spirit realm.\\" The ancestor or god who was being contacted was depicted as emerging from the serpent's mouth. The vision serpent thus came to be the method in which ancestors or gods manifested themselves to the Maya. Thus for them, the Vision Serpent was a direct link between the spirit realm of the gods and the physical world.Schele & Freidel (1990, p.395) The Vision Serpent goes back to earlier Maya conceptions and lies at the center of the world as they conceived it. \\"It is in the center axis atop the World Tree. Essentially the World Tree and the Vision Serpent, representing the king, created the center axis which communicates between the spiritual and the earthly worlds or planes. It is through ritual that the king could bring the center axis into existence in the temples and create a doorway to the spiritual world, and with it power.\\"Schele & Freidel (1990, p.68) The Vision Serpent is prevalent in bloodletting ceremonies, in Maya religious practices, Maya jewelry, pottery and their architecture. Bloodletting rituals Many have attempted to explain the manifestation of the Vision Serpent in association with Maya bloodletting. One conclusion is \\"that massive blood loss causes the brain to release an abundance of natural endorphins, which are chemically related to opiates. As the body goes into shock, a hallucinatory vision occurs.\\" Once the actual bloodletting was over, the blood soaked ceremonial papers were burned, releasing a column of smoke. The smoke provided the perfect medium for the Vision Serpent to appear. Every major political or religious event involved bloodletting because it provided a medium by which the gods could be called upon to witness and actually participate in the ceremony. Sometimes the spirits of ancestors were also called upon to give guidance. The Hauberg Stela (A. D. 199) from the Maya Lowlands \\"is one of the first dated monuments that depict the Vision Serpent's connection to bloodletting\\". Lintel 25 depicts one of the bloodletting rituals. \\"One of Shield Jaguar's wives, is seen gazing up towards an enormous bicephalous Vision Serpent. In her left hand, she holds a bowl containing a stingray spine, an obsidian lancet, and papers spattered with blood. The Vision Serpent appears to be emanating from the bowl. From the jaws of the Vision Serpent, spews forth an ancestral Tlaloc warrior complete with spear and shield\\".Graham & von Euw (1977) Lintel 17 refers to \\"Bird Jaguars as Blood Lord of Yaxchilan\\" and shows him preparing to draw blood from his penis with a stingray spine. Opposite Bird Jaguar is Lady Balam-Ix, who proceeds to pass coarse rope through a gouge in her tongue. The blood is being collected in the vessel near Bird Jaguar's feet. The Vision Serpent's mouth is green and, the trickles of blood characteristic of bloodletting are red\\".Graham & von Euw (1977) Lintel 15 depicts the appearance of this Vision Serpent. \\"The serpent can be seen rising out of the bowl with trickles of blood along a column of blood scrolls. This lintel shows the queen of Yaxchilan involved in a visionary experience following an elaborate bloodletting ceremony. She holds the ritual paraphernalia in her arms while the vision serpent rises from a bowl of blood stained paper.\\"Graham & von Euw (1977) Maya religious rites There was a Vision Serpent named Och-Kan, lord of Kalak'mul. One of the most common rituals associated with the Vision serpent involved invoking ancestral spirits. Especially during coronation rites, the kings would contact the spirits for guidance and blessings. It is the Vision Serpent who provides the medium for contacting these deities. It is believed that Lord Pakal's sarcophagus lid, which was located at Palenque, is probably ‚Äúthe single most comprehensive image which relates the Vision Serpent to Maya religion.‚Äù It depicts the death of Pakal and his descent into the Underworld. ‚ÄúThe bicepalous serpent bar is placed horizontally on the World Tree and is the conduit for this transition. In the same way that the Vision Serpent represents a conduit between the physical world and the spirit realm of the ancestors, this bicephalous serpent bar represents a conduit between the realm of the living and the realm of the dead.‚Äù Maya jewelry and pottery A piece of Maya jewelry depicts an ‚Äúanthropomorphic, bicephalous serpent.‚Äù It is believed to have been worn during a bloodletting ceremony. It clearly shows the arrival of an ancestor from the spirit realm. The portrayal of the Vision Serpent was very prevalent in Maya pottery. Vessels used during bloodletting ceremonies, depict the Vision serpent. The vessels below are excellent examples. They are carved in stone and are ‚Äúsome of the earliest depiction of Vision Serpent iconography. Blood spews forth from the open jaws of the front head. Although the rear is not physically attached, it sits just above the serpent's tail and also represents blood‚Äù.Schele & Miller (1992) Maya architectural motifs The Vision Serpent also finds a place in Maya architecture and is especially prominent in the decoration of pillars on the interior and exterior of Maya temples. ‚ÄùIn the palace at Labna, serpents adorn the corners of the principle facade. Characteristic of the Vision Serpent, there appears to be either an anthropomorphic deity or the spirit of an ancestor emanating from the gaping jaws of the serpent's mouth‚Äù.Ivanoff (1973) Contemporary observances Remnants of the Vision Serpent have survived until modern times. Around 1930, J.E.S. Thompson noted in San Antonio, Belize, that the Q'eqchi' Maya still performed a ritual very similar to the vision quest of the classic Maya, although in a different context. The ritual marked the initiation of a new shaman for the village. The participant came into direct contact with a giant serpent, Ochan (Och-Kan). It was through this experience that he completed his initiation rites and gained the knowledge that is needed to become a powerful shaman.

He was a record-holding varsity swimmer during his sophomore year. Early in Knowles's career, he wrote for the Hartford Courant and was assistant editor for Holiday magazine. With encouragement from Thornton Wilder, he concurrently began writing novels. A Separate Peace A Separate Peace (1959) A Separate Peace was first published in London by Secker and Warburg in 1959. Published in New York in 1960 by Macmillan, it is his most celebrated work. The novel is based upon Knowles's experiences at Phillips Exeter Academy. The Devon School, the book's setting, is a thinly veiled fictionalization of Exeter, with both campus and town easily recognizable. Although the plot is not autobiographical, elements of the novel stem from personal experience, including Knowles's membership in a secret society and his sustaining a foot injury while jumping from a tree during society exercises. In his essay \\"A Special Time, A Special Place,\\" Knowles wrote: \\"The only elements in A Separate Peace which were not in that summer were anger, violence, and hatred. There was only friendship, athleticism, and loyalty.\\" The secondary character Finny (Phineas) is the friend of the main character Gene. Knowles has stated that he modeled Finny on David Hackett from Milton Academy, whom he met when both attended a summer session at Phillips Exeter Academy. Hackett was a friend of Robert F. Kennedy, under whom he later served in the U.S. Justice Department. A student called Phineas Sprague lived in the same dormitory as Knowles during the summer session of 1943 and may have inspired the character's name. In his memoir Palimpsest, Gore Vidal acknowledged that he and Knowles concurrently attended Phillips Exeter Academy, with Vidal two years ahead. Vidal stated that Knowles told him that the character Brinker was based on him. \\"We have been friends for many years now,\\" Vidal said, \\"and I admire the novel that he based on our school days, A Separate Peace.\\" Awards Knowles won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction and the Rosenthal Award of the National Institute of Arts and Letters.

He was the eldest child of President Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln, and the only one of their four children to live to adulthood. Robert Lincoln became a business lawyer and company president, and served as U.S. Secretary of War and U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois, and graduated from Harvard College before serving on the staff of Ulysses S. Grant as a captain in the Union Army in the closing days of the American Civil War. After the war, he married Mary Eunice Harlan, and they had three children together. Following completion of law school in Chicago, he built a successful law practice, and became wealthy representing corporate clients. Active in Republican politics, and a tangible symbol of his father's legacy, Lincoln was often spoken of as a possible candidate for office, including the presidency, but never took steps to mount a campaign. The one office to which he was elected was town supervisor of South Chicago, which he held from 1876 to 1877; the town later became part of the city of Chicago. Lincoln served as United States Secretary of War in the administration of James A. Garfield, continuing under Chester A. Arthur, and as United States Minister to the United Kingdom in the Benjamin Harrison administration. Lincoln became general counsel of the Pullman Palace Car Company, and after founder George Pullman died in 1897, Lincoln was the company's president. After retiring from this position in 1911, Lincoln served as chairman of the board until 1922. In Lincoln's later years he resided at homes in Washington, D.C. and Manchester, Vermont; the Manchester home, Hildene, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. In 1922, he took part in the dedication ceremonies for the Lincoln Memorial. Lincoln died at Hildene on July 26, 1926, six days before his 83rd birthday, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Family and early life Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois, on August 1, 1843, to Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln. He had three younger brothers, Edward, William, and Tad. By the time Lincoln was born, his father had become a well- known member of the Whig political party and had previously served as a member of the Illinois state legislature for four terms. He was named after his maternal grandfather, Robert Smith Todd. When his father became president of the United States on the eve of the American Civil War, Lincoln was the only one of the president's three children to be largely on his own. He took the Harvard College entrance examination in 1859, but failed fifteen out of the sixteen subjects. He was then enrolled at Phillips Exeter Academy to further prepare for attending college, and he graduated in 1860. Admitted to Harvard College, he graduated in 1864, and was a member of the Hasty Pudding Club and the Delta Kappa Epsilon (Alpha chapter). Welsh author Jan Morris wrote that Robert Lincoln \\"having failed fifteen out of sixteen subjects in the Harvard entrance examination, got in at last and emerged an unsympathetic bore.\\" After graduating from Harvard, Lincoln enrolled at Harvard Law School. When he initially expressed interest in the law school to his father, President Lincoln made reference to his own pleasant, but informal legal training by stating \\"If you do, you should learn more than I ever did, but you will never have so good a time.\\" Robert Lincoln attended Harvard Law School from September 1864 to January 1865, and left in order to join the Union Army. In 1893, Harvard awarded Lincoln the honorary degree of LL.D. Much to the embarrassment of the president, Mary Todd Lincoln prevented Robert Lincoln from joining the Army until shortly before the war's conclusion. \\"We have lost one son, and his loss is as much as I can bear, without being called upon to make another sacrifice,\\" Mary Todd Lincoln insisted to President Lincoln. President Lincoln argued \\"our son is not more dear to us than the sons of other people are to their mothers.\\" However, Mary Todd Lincoln persisted by stating that she could not \\"bear to have Robert exposed to danger.\\" In January 1865, the First Lady yielded and President Lincoln wrote Ulysses S. Grant, asking if Robert could be placed on his staff. Robert Todd Lincoln, circa 1860‚Äì1870 On February 11, 1865, he was commissioned as an assistant adjutant with the rank of captain and served in the last weeks of the American Civil War as part of General Ulysses S. Grant's immediate staff, a position which sharply reduced the likelihood that he would be involved in actual combat. He was present at Appomattox when Lee surrendered. He resigned his commission on June 12, 1865, and returned to civilian life. Lincoln had a distant relationship with his father, in part because, during his formative years, Abraham Lincoln spent months on the judicial circuit. Their relationship was similar to the one Abraham Lincoln had with his own father. Lincoln recalled, \\"During my childhood and early youth he was almost constantly away from home, attending court or making political speeches.\\" Robert would later say his most vivid image of his father was of packing saddlebags to prepare for his travels through Illinois. Abraham Lincoln was proud of Robert and thought him bright, but also something of a competitor. An acquaintance purportedly said, \\"he guessed Bob would not do better than he had.\\"quoted in Donald, p. 428 The two lacked the strong bond Lincoln had with his other sons Willie and Tad, but Robert deeply admired his father and wept openly at his deathbed.Donald, p. 599 On the night of his father's death, Robert had turned down an invitation to accompany his parents to Ford's Theatre, citing fatigue after spending much of his recent time in a covered wagon at the battlefront.Ralph Gary, The Presidents Were Here: A State-by-State Historical Guide, 2008, page 43Deanna Spingola, The Ruling Elite: A Study in Imperialism, Genocide and Emancipation, 2011, page 556Jason Emerson, Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T. Lincoln, 2011, page 100 On April 25, 1865, Robert Lincoln wrote President Andrew Johnson requesting that he and his family be allowed to stay for two and a half weeks because his mother had told him that \\"she can not possibly be ready to leave here.\\" Lincoln also acknowledged that he was aware of the \\"great inconvenience\\" that Johnson had since becoming president of the United States only a short time earlier. Following his father's assassination, in April 1865 Robert moved with his mother and his brother Tad to Chicago. He attended classes at the Old University of Chicago law school (now the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law) and studied law at the Chicago firm of Scammon, McCagg & Fuller. He was admitted to the bar on February 25, 1867. On January 1, 1866, Lincoln moved out of the apartment he shared with his mother and brother. He rented his own rooms in downtown Chicago to \\"begin to live with some degree of comfort\\" which he had not known when living with his family. Lincoln was licensed as an attorney in Chicago on February 22, 1867. He was certified to practice law four days later on February 26, 1867. On September 24, 1868, Lincoln married the former Mary Eunice Harlan (September 25, 1846 ‚Äì March 31, 1937), daughter of Senator James Harlan and Ann Eliza Peck of Mount Pleasant, Iowa. They had two daughters and one son. * Mary \\"Mamie\\" Lincoln (October 15, 1869 ‚Äì November 21, 1938) * Abraham Lincoln II (nicknamed \\"Jack\\") (August 14, 1873 ‚Äì March 5, 1890) * Jessie Harlan Lincoln (November 6, 1875 ‚Äì January 4, 1948) In an era before air conditioning, Robert, Mary, and the children would often leave their hot city life behind for the cooler climate of Mt. Pleasant. During the 1880s the family would summer at the Harlan home. The Harlan-Lincoln home, built in 1876, still stands today. Donated by Mary Harlan Lincoln to Iowa Wesleyan College in 1907, it now serves as a museum containing a collection of artifacts from the Lincoln family and from Abraham Lincoln's presidency. Robert Lincoln's home in Washington, D.C. from 1918 until his death in 1926 Robert Todd Lincoln's mansion Hildene in Manchester, Vermont =Relationship with Mary Todd Lincoln= In 1871, tragedy beset the family again when Lincoln's only surviving brother, Tad, died at the age of 18, leaving his mother devastated with grief. Lincoln, who was already concerned about what he thought were his mother's \\"spend-thrift\\" ways and eccentric behavior, and fearing that she was a danger to herself, arranged to have her committed to a psychiatric hospital in Batavia, Illinois, in 1875. With his mother in the hospital, he was left with control of her finances. On May 20, 1875, she arrived at Bellevue Place, a private, upscale sanitarium in the Fox River Valley.Mary Todd Lincoln's Stay at Bellevue Place. Showcase.netins.net. Retrieved on August 6, 2011. Three months after being installed in Bellevue Place, Mary Lincoln engineered her escape. She smuggled letters to her lawyer, James B. Bradwell, and his wife, Myra Bradwell, who was not only her friend but also a feminist lawyer and fellow spiritualist. She also wrote to the editor of the Chicago Times, known for its sensational journalism. Soon, the public embarrassments Robert had hoped to avoid were looming, and his character and motives were in question. The director of Bellevue, who at Mary's commitment trial had assured the jury she would benefit from treatment at his facility, now in the face of potentially damaging publicity, declared her well enough to go to Springfield to live with her sister as she desired., Wellesley Centers for Women 2008 The commitment proceedings and following events led to a profound estrangement between Lincoln and his mother, and they never fully reconciled. Politics =Secretary of War (1881‚Äì1885)= From 1876 to 1877 Lincoln served as Town Supervisor of South Chicago, a town which was later absorbed into the city of Chicago. In 1877 he turned down President Rutherford B. Hayes' offer to appoint him Assistant Secretary of State, but later accepted an appointment as President James Garfield's Secretary of War, serving from 1881 to 1885 under Presidents Garfield and Chester A. Arthur. Oscar Dudley During his term in office, the Cincinnati Riots of 1884 broke out over a case in which a jury gave a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder in a case that many suspected was rigged. Forty-five people died during three days of rioting before U.S. troops dispatched by Lincoln reestablished calm. Following his service as Secretary of War, Lincoln helped Oscar Dudley in establishing the Illinois Industrial Training School for Boys in Norwood Park in 1887, after Dudley (a Humane Society employee) \\"discovered more homeless, neglected and abused boys than dogs on the city streets.\\" The school relocated to Glenwood, Illinois in 1890 and most recently changed its name to Glenwood Academy. =Minister to the Court of St James's= Lincoln served as the U.S. minister to the United Kingdom, formally the Court of St James's, from 1889 to 1893 under President Benjamin Harrison. Lincoln's teenage son, Abraham II \\"Jack\\", died during this time in Europe. After serving as minister, Lincoln returned to private business as a lawyer. Taft, President Harding and Lincoln at the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial in 1922 =Later life= Lincoln was general counsel of the Pullman Palace Car Company under George Pullman, and was named president after Pullman's death in 1897. According to Almont Lindsey's 1942 book, The Pullman Strike, Lincoln arranged to have Pullman quietly excused from the subpoena issued for Pullman to testify in the 1895 trials of the leaders of the American Railway Union for conspiracy during the 1894 Pullman strike. Pullman hid from the deputy marshal sent to his office with the subpoena and then appeared with Lincoln to meet privately with Judge Grosscup after the jury had been dismissed.Lindsey, The Pullman Strike, p. 301. In 1911, Lincoln became chairman of the board, a position he held until 1922. A serious amateur astronomer, Lincoln constructed an observatory at his home in Manchester, Vermont, and equipped it with a refracting telescope made in 1909 by Warner & Swasey with a six-inch objective lens by John A. Brashear Co., Ltd. Lincoln's telescope and observatory still exist; it has been restored and is used by a local astronomy club.Revised List of Telescopes by Warner & Swasey Company as augmented by E. N. Jennison from Records in Engineering Department, Warner & Swasey Corp. Papers, Case Western Reserve University Robert Lincoln made his last public appearance at the dedication ceremony in Washington, D.C. for his father's memorial on May 30, 1922. Lincoln was also a dedicated golfer, and served as president of the Ekwanok Country Club in Manchester. Presence at assassinations Robert Lincoln was coincidentally either present or nearby when three presidential assassinations occurred. * Lincoln was not present at his father's assassination.NPS Historical Handbook: Ford's Theatre.

The president was moved to the Petersen House after the shooting, where Robert attended his father's deathbed. * At President James A. Garfield's invitation, Lincoln was at the Sixth Street Train Station in Washington, D.C., when the president was shot by Charles J. Guiteau on July 2, 1881, and was an eyewitness to the event. Lincoln was serving as Garfield's Secretary of War at the time. * At President William McKinley's invitation, Lincoln was at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, where the president was shot by Leon Czolgosz on September 6, 1901, though he was not an eyewitness to the event; he was just outside the building where the shooting occurred. Lincoln himself recognized these coincidences. He is said to have refused a later presidential invitation with the comment, \\"No, I'm not going, and they'd better not ask me, because there is a certain fatality about presidential functions when I am present.\\" Robert Lincoln and Edwin Booth Robert Lincoln was once saved from possible serious injury or death by Edwin Booth, whose brother, John Wilkes Booth, was the assassin of Robert's father. The incident took place on a train platform in Jersey City, New Jersey. The exact date of the incident is uncertain, but it is believed to have taken place in late 1863 or early 1864, before John Wilkes Booth's assassination of President Lincoln (April 14, 1865). Robert Lincoln recalled the incident in a 1909 letter to Richard Watson Gilder, editor of The Century Magazine: Months after the incident, while serving as an officer on the staff of General Ulysses S. Grant, Robert Lincoln recalled the incident to his fellow officer, Colonel Adam Badeau, who happened to be a friend of Edwin Booth. Badeau sent a letter to Booth, complimenting the actor for his heroism. Before receiving the letter, Booth had been unaware that the man whose life he had saved on the train platform had been the president's son. The incident was said to have been of some comfort to Edwin Booth following his brother's assassination of the president.Robert Todd Lincoln: A Man In His Own Right by John S. Goff, p. 70-71.Edwin Booth Saved Robert Todd Lincoln's Life. History Net. Retrieved on August 6, 2011. President Ulysses S. Grant also sent Booth a letter of gratitude for his action. Republican politics From 1884 to 1912, Lincoln's name was mentioned in varying degrees of seriousness as a candidate for the Republican presidential or vice-presidential nomination. At every turn, he adamantly disavowed any interest in running and stated he would not accept nomination for either position.Robert Todd Lincoln: The Perpetual Non- Candidate.

He is buried with his wife, Mary, and their son, Abraham II (\\"Jack\\"), who had died in London, England, of sepsis in 1890 at the age of 16. Weeks after Jack's death, Robert wrote to his cousin Charles Edwards, \\"We had a long & most anxious struggle and at times had hopes of saving our boy. It would have been done if it had depended only on his own marvelous pluck & patience now that the end has come, there is a great blank in our future lives & an affliction not to be measured.\\" Legacy According to historian Michael Burlingame, historians typically consider Robert Todd Lincoln, \\"a particularly unfortunate even tragic figure.\\" Like so many sons of famous fathers, he lacks a strong sense of identity. He once complained, \\"No one wanted me for Secretary of War... For minister to England... For president of the Pullman Company; they wanted Abraham Lincoln's son.\\" Nevertheless, he accepted the appointments and was very well-paid, becoming a millionaire lawyer and businessman, fond of the pleasures of the wealthy conservative Victorian gentleman of his social circle. He had little in common with his father personally or politically ‚Äì he was not humorous or unpretentious, but rather cold, stuffy and aloof.Michael Burlingame, \\"Lincoln, Robert Todd,\\" in John A. Garraty, ed., Encyclopedia of American Biography (1974) pp 667‚Äì668. Lincoln was the last surviving member of both the Garfield and Arthur Cabinets.

Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United States between 1948 and 1950 and her many visits to continental Europe. Ferrier was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 1951. In between periods of hospitalisation and convalescence she continued to perform and record; her final public appearance was as Orfeo, at the Royal Opera House in February 1953, eight months before her death. Among her many memorials, the Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund was launched in May 1954. The Kathleen Ferrier Scholarship Fund, administered by the Royal Philharmonic Society, has since 1956 made annual awards to aspiring young professional singers. Early life =Childhood= Higher Walton The Ferrier family originally came from Pembrokeshire in South West Wales. The Lancashire branch originated in the 19th century, when Thomas Ferrier (youngest son of Private Thomas Ferrier of the Pembrokeshire Regiment) settled in the area after being stationed near Blackburn during a period of industrial unrest.Cardus, pp. 19‚Äì20 Kathleen Ferrier was born on 22 April 1912, in the Lancashire village of Higher Walton where her father William Ferrier (the fourth child of Thomas and Elizabeth, n√©e Gorton) was the head of the village school. Although untrained musically, William was an enthusiastic member of the local operatic society and of several choirs, and his wife Alice (n√©e Murray), whom he married in 1900, was a competent singer with a strong contralto voice.Ferrier, pp. 14‚Äì16 Kathleen was the third and youngest of the couple's children, following a sister and a brother; when she was two the family moved to Blackburn, after William was appointed headmaster of St Paul's School in the town. From an early age Kathleen showed promise as a pianist, and had lessons with Frances Walker, a noted North of England piano teacher who had been a pupil of Tobias Matthay. Kathleen's talent developed quickly; in 1924 she came fourth out of 43 entrants at the Lytham St Annes Festival piano competition, and in the following year at Lytham she achieved second place.Leonard, pp. 7‚Äì8 =Telephonist and pianist= King George's Hall, Blackburn, the venue in which Ferrier made several youthful appearances as an accompanist at \\"celebrity\\" concerts Because of William's impending retirement and the consequent fall in the family's income, Ferrier's hopes of attending a music college could not be realised. In August 1926 she left school to start work as a trainee at the GPO telephone exchange in Blackburn.Leonard, p. 10 She continued her piano studies under Frances Walker, and in November 1928 was the regional winner in a national contest for young pianists, organised by the Daily Express. Although unsuccessful in the London finals which followed, Ferrier won a Cramer upright piano as a prize.Leonard, pp. 12‚Äì14 On 10 March 1929 she made a well-received appearance as an accompanist in a concert at Blackburn's King George's Hall.Cardus, pp. 15‚Äì16 After further piano competition successes she was invited to perform a short radio recital at the Manchester studios of the BBC, and on 3 July 1930 made her first broadcast, playing works by Brahms and Percy Grainger. Around this time she completed her training and she became a fully fledged telephonist.Ferrier, p. 30 In 1931, aged 19, Ferrier passed her Licentiate examinations at the Royal Academy of Music. In that year she started occasional singing lessons, and in December sang a small mezzo-soprano role in a church performance of Mendelssohn's oratorio Elijah. However, her voice was not thought to be exceptional; her musical life centred on the piano and on local concerts, at King George's Hall and elsewhere.Leonard, pp. 19‚Äì20 Early in 1934 she transferred to the Blackpool telephone exchange and took lodgings nearby, to be close to her new boyfriend, a bank clerk named Albert Wilson.Leonard, p. 22 While at Blackpool she auditioned for the new \\"speaking clock\\" service which the GPO was preparing to introduce. In her excitement, Ferrier inserted an extra aspirate into her audition, and was not chosen for the final selection in London.Leonard, p. 23Ferrier, p. 33 Her decision in 1935 to marry Wilson meant the end of her employment with the telephone exchange, since at that time the GPO did not employ married women.Leonard, p. 26 Of Ferrier's career to this point, the music biographer Humphrey Burton wrote: \\"For more than a decade, when she should have been studying music with the best teachers, learning English literature and foreign languages, acquiring stage craft and movement skills, and travelling to London regularly to see opera, Miss Ferrier was actually answering the telephone, getting married to a bank manager and winning tinpot competitions for her piano-playing.\\" =Marriage= Ferrier met Albert Wilson in 1933, probably through dancing, which they both loved. When she announced that they were to marry, her family and friends had strong reservations, on the grounds that she was young and inexperienced, and that she and Wilson shared few serious interests. Nevertheless, the marriage took place on 19 November 1935. Shortly afterwards the couple moved to Silloth, a small port town in Cumberland, where Wilson had been appointed as manager of his bank's branch. The marriage was not successful; the honeymoon had revealed problems of physical incompatibility, and the union remained unconsummated.Leonard, pp. 26‚Äì28 Outward appearances were maintained for a few years, until Wilson's departure for military service in 1940 effectively ended the marriage. The couple divorced in 1947, though they remained on good terms. Wilson subsequently married a friend of Ferrier's, Wyn Hetherington; he died in 1969.Leonard, pp. 27 and 39 Early singing career St Kentigern's Church at Aspatria, Cumbria, the scene of Ferrier's first professional singing engagement in 1937 In 1937 Ferrier entered the Carlisle Festival open piano competition and, as a result of a small bet with her husband, also signed up for the singing contest. She easily won the piano trophy; in the singing finals she sang Roger Quilter's To Daisies, a performance which earned her the festival's top vocal award. To mark her double triumph in piano and voice, Ferrier was awarded a special rose bowl as champion of the festival.Leonard, pp. 28‚Äì30 After her Carlisle victories, Ferrier began to receive offers of singing engagements. Her first appearance as a professional vocalist, in autumn 1937, was at a harvest festival celebration in the village church at Aspatria.Leonard, p. 33 She was paid one guinea. After winning the gold cup at the 1938 Workington Festival, Ferrier sang \\"Ma Curly-Headed Babby\\" in a concert at Workington Opera House. Cecil McGivern, producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show, was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 23 February 1939. This broadcast‚Äîher first as a vocalist‚Äîattracted wide attention, and led to more radio work, though for Ferrier the event was overshadowed by the death of her mother at the beginning of February.Leonard, pp. 33‚Äì35Ferrier, pp. 39‚Äì40 At the 1939 Carlisle Festival, Ferrier sang Richard Strauss's song All Souls' Day, a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators, J. E. Hutchinson, a music teacher with a considerable reputation. Ferrier became his pupil and, under his guidance, began to extend her repertoire to include works by Bach, Handel, Brahms and Elgar.Leonard, pp. 36‚Äì38 When Albert Wilson joined the army in 1940, Ferrier reverted to her maiden name, having until then sung as 'Kathleen Wilson'. In December 1940 she appeared for the first time professionally as 'Kathleen Ferrier' in a performance of Handel's Messiah, under Hutchinson's direction. In early 1941 she successfully auditioned as a singer with the Council for the Encouragement of the Arts (CEMA), which provided concerts and other entertainments to military camps, factories and other workplaces. Within this organisation Ferrier began working with artists with international reputations; in December 1941 she sang with the Hall√© Orchestra in a performance of Messiah together with Isobel Baillie, the distinguished soprano.Leonard, pp. 40‚Äì41 However, her application to the BBC's head of music in Manchester for an audition was turned down.Fifield (ed.), p. 17Ferrier, p. 45 Ferrier had better fortune when she was introduced to Malcolm Sargent after a Hall√© concert in Blackpool. Sargent agreed to hear her sing, and afterwards recommended her to Ibbs and Tillett, the London-based concert management agency.Leonard, pp. 42‚Äì43 John Tillett accepted her as a client without hesitation after which, on Sargent's advice, Ferrier decided to base herself in London. On 24 December 1942 she moved with her sister Winifred into a flat in Frognal Mansions, Hampstead.Leonard, pp. 45‚Äì47Ferrier, pp. 46‚Äì48 Stardom =Growing reputation= Ferrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert organised by Dame Myra Hess.Leonard, pp. 50‚Äì51 Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary,Fifield (ed.), p. 222 Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\".Hendeson, pp. 40‚Äì41 However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\".Henderson, p. 58 Benjamin Britten in the mid-1960s On 17 May 1943 Ferrier sang in Handel's Messiah at Westminster Abbey, alongside Isobel Baillie and Peter Pears, with Reginald Jacques conducting.Leonard, p. 57Ferrier, p. 53 According to the critic Neville Cardus, it was through the quality of her singing here that Ferrier \\"made her first serious appeal to musicians\\".Cardus, p. 28 Her assured performance led to other important engagements, and to broadcasting work; her increasingly frequent appearances on popular programmes such as Forces Favourites and Housewives' Choice soon gave her national recognition. In May 1944, at EMI's Abbey Road Studios with Gerald Moore as her accompanist, she made test recordings of music by Brahms, Gluck and Elgar. Her first published record, made in September 1944, was issued under the Columbia label; it consisted of two songs by Maurice Greene, again with Moore accompanying.Campion, pp. 5‚Äì6 Her time as a Columbia recording artist was brief and unhappy; she had poor relations with her producer, Walter Legge, and after a few months she transferred to Decca.Campion, pp. 8‚Äì11 In the remaining wartime months Ferrier continued to travel throughout the country, to fulfil the growing demands for her services from concert promoters. At Leeds in November 1944 she sang the part of the Angel in Elgar's choral work The Dream of Gerontius, her first performance in what became one of her best-known roles.Leonard, p. 73 In December she met John Barbirolli while working on another Elgar piece, Sea Pictures; the conductor later became one of her closest friends and strongest advocates.Leonard, pp. 74‚Äì75 and 86 On 15 September 1945 Ferrier made her debut at the London Proms, when she sang L'Air des Adieux from Tchaikovsky's opera The Maid of Orleans.Leonard, p. 80Ferrier, p. 70 Although she often sang individual arias, opera was not Ferrier's natural forte; she had not enjoyed singing the title role in a concert version of Bizet's Carmen at Stourbridge in March 1944, and generally avoided similar engagements.Leonard, p. 67, Fifield (ed.), p. 234 Nevertheless, Benjamin Britten, who had heard her Westminster Abbey Messiah performance, persuaded her to create the role of Lucretia in his new opera The Rape of Lucretia, which was to open the first postwar Glyndebourne Festival in 1946. She would share the part with Nancy Evans.Britten, pp. 83‚Äì85 Despite her initial misgivings, by early July Ferrier was writing to her agent that she was \\"enjoying [the rehearsals] tremendously and I should think it's the best part one could possibly have\\".Fifield (ed.), p. 31 Bruno Walter, the German-born conductor with whom Ferrier worked closely from 1947 until her death Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received.Leonard, pp. 89‚Äì90 On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance.Leonard, p. 91 This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\"Fifield (ed.), p. 33 Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che far√≤ (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.Leonard, pp. 94‚Äì96 Ferrier's association with Glyndebourne bore further fruit when Rudolf Bing, the festival's general manager, recommended her to Bruno Walter as the contralto soloist in a performance of Mahler's symphonic song cycle Das Lied von der Erde. This was planned for the 1947 Edinburgh International Festival. Walter was initially wary of working with a relatively new singer, but after her audition his fears were allayed; \\"I recognised with delight that here potentially was one of the greatest singers of our time\\", he later wrote.Walter, pp. 110‚Äì11 Das Lied von der Erde was at that time largely unknown in Britain, and some critics found it unappealing; nevertheless, the Edinburgh Evening News thought it \\"simply superb\\".Leonard, p. 100 In a later biographical sketch of Ferrier, Lord Harewood described the partnership between Walter and her, which endured until the singer's final illness, as \\"a rare match of music, voice and temperament.\\" =Career apex, 1948‚Äì51= Ferrier in Orfeo & Eurydice (1949) On 1 January 1948 Ferrier left for a four-week tour of North America, the first of three transatlantic trips she would make during the next three years. In New York she sang two performances of Das Lied von der Erde, with Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic. Alma Mahler, the composer's widow, was present at the first of these, on 15 January. In a letter written the following day, Ferrier told her sister: \\"Some of the critics are enthusiastic, others unimpressed\\".Fifield (ed.), p. 49 After the second performance, which was broadcast from coast to coast, Ferrier gave recitals in Ottawa and Chicago before returning to New York and embarking for home on 4 February.Leonard, pp. 104‚Äì14 During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier performed Brahms's Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, and sang in Bach's Mass in B minor at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hall√© Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She returned to the Netherlands in January 1949 for a series of recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour.Leonard, pp. 115‚Äì20 This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics.Leonard, p. 121 On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arp√°d S√°ndor (1896‚Äì1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated \\"this abominable accompanist\\" who deserved \\"a kick in the pants\\".Fifield (ed.), pp. 60‚Äì61 When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour's promoters: \\"What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me\\".Fifield (ed.), p. 64 Eventually, when S√°ndor was too ill to appear, Ferrier was able to recruit a Canadian pianist, John Newmark, with whom she formed a warm and lasting working relationship.Leonard, pp. 127‚Äì28 Marian Anderson, who said of Ferrier: \\"What a voice‚Äîand what a face!\\" Shortly after her return to Britain early in June 1949, Ferrier left for Amsterdam where, on 14 July, she sang in the world premiere of Britten's Spring Symphony, with Eduard van Beinum and the Concertgebouw Orchestra.Leonard, p. 142 Britten had written this work specifically for her. At the Edinburgh Festival in September she gave two recitals in which Bruno Walter acted as her piano accompanist. Ferrier felt that these recitals represented \\"a peak to which I had been groping for the last three years\\".Fifield (ed.), p. 93 A broadcast of one of the recitals was issued on record many years later; of this, the critic Alan Blyth wrote: \\"Walter's very personal and positive support obviously pushes Ferrier to give of her very best\\". The following 18 months saw almost uninterrupted activity, encompassing a number of visits to continental Europe and a third American tour between December 1949 and April 1950. This American trip broke new ground for Ferrier‚Äîthe West Coast‚Äîand included three performances in San Francisco of Orfeo ed Euridice, with Pierre Monteux conducting. At the rehearsals Ferrier met the renowned American contralto Marian Anderson, who reportedly said of her English counterpart: \\"My God, what a voice‚Äîand what a face!\\"Leonard, pp. 153‚Äì55 On Ferrier's return home the hectic pace continued, with a rapid succession of concerts in Amsterdam, London and Edinburgh followed by a tour of Austria, Switzerland and Italy.Leonard, pp. 160‚Äì64 In Vienna, the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was Ferrier's co-soloist in a recorded performance of Bach's Mass in B minor, with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra under Herbert von Karajan. Schwarzkopf later recalled Ferrier's singing of the Agnus Dei from the Mass as her highlight of the year.Leonard, p. 165 Early in 1951, while on tour in Rome, Ferrier learned of her father's death at the age of 83.Ferrier, p. 147 Although she was upset by this news, she decided to continue with the tour; her diary entry for 30 January reads: \\"My Pappy died peacefully after flu and a slight stroke\\".Fifield (ed.), p. 287 She returned to London on 19 February, and was immediately busy rehearsing with Barbirolli and the Hall√© a work that was new to her: Ernest Chausson's Po√®me de l'amour et de la mer. This was performed at Manchester on 28 February, to critical acclaim.Leonard, p. 177 Two weeks later Ferrier discovered a lump on her breast. She nevertheless fulfilled several engagements in Germany, the Netherlands and at Glyndebourne before seeing her doctor on 24 March. After tests at University College Hospital, cancer of the breast was diagnosed, and a mastectomy was performed on 10 April.Ferrier, p. 155, Leonard, pp. 179‚Äì81 All immediate engagements were cancelled; among these was a planned series of performances of The Rape of Lucretia by the English Opera Group, scheduled as part of the 1951 Festival of Britain.Britten, p. 86 Later career =Failing health= Manchester's Free Trade Hall, where Ferrier sang Land of Hope and Glory at its reopening after war damage, on 16 November 1951. Ferrier resumed her career on 19 June 1951, in the Mass in B minor at the Royal Albert Hall. She then made her usual visit to the Holland Festival, where she gave four performances of Orfeo, and sang in Mahler's Second Symphony with Otto Klemperer and the Concertgebouw Orchestra.Leonard, pp. 188‚Äì89 Through the summer her concert schedule was interspersed with hospital visits; however, she was well enough to sing at the Edinburgh Festival in September, where she performed two recitals with Walter and sang Chausson's Po√®me with Barbirolli and the Hall√©.Leonard, pp. 190‚Äì93 In November she sang Land of Hope and Glory at the reopening of Manchester's Free Trade Hall, a climax to the evening which, wrote Barbirolli, \\"moved everyone, not least the conductor, to tears\\". After this, Ferrier rested for two months while she underwent radiation therapy; her only work engagement during December was a three-day recording session of folk songs at the Decca studios.Campion, pp. 80‚Äì82 In January 1952 Ferrier joined Britten and Pears in a short series of concerts to raise funds for Britten's English Opera Group. Writing later, Britten recalled this tour as \\"perhaps the loveliest of all\\" of his artistic associations with Ferrier.Britten, p. 87 Despite continuing health problems, she sang in the St Matthew Passion at the Royal Albert Hall on 30 March, Messiah at the Free Trade Hall on 13 April, and Das Lied von der Erde with Barbirolli and the Hall√© on 23 and 24 April.Fifield (ed.), p. 296 On 30 April Ferrier attended a private party at which the new Queen, Elizabeth II, and her sister, Princess Margaret, were present. In her diary, Ferrier notes: \\"Princess M sang‚Äîvery good!\\". Her health continued to deteriorate; she refused to consider a course of androgen injections, believing that this treatment would destroy the quality of her voice.Leonard, p. 207 In May she travelled to Vienna to record Das Lied and Mahler's R√ºckert- Lieder with Walter and the Vienna Philharmonic; singer and conductor had long sought to preserve their partnership on disc. Despite considerable suffering, Ferrier completed the recording sessions between 15 and 20 May.Campion, pp. 87‚Äì90Leonard, pp. 208‚Äì11 During the remainder of 1952 Ferrier attended her seventh successive Edinburgh Festival, singing in performances of Das Lied, The Dream of Gerontius, Messiah and some Brahms songs.Leonard, pp. 217‚Äì19 She undertook several studio recording sessions, including a series of Bach and Handel arias with Sir Adrian Boult and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in October.Campion, pp. 97‚Äì98 In November, after a Royal Festival Hall recital, she was distressed by a review in which Neville Cardus criticised her performance for introducing \\"distracting extra vocal appeals\\" designed to please the audience at the expense of the songs. However, she accepted his comments with good grace, remarking that \\"... it's hard to please everybody‚Äîfor years I've been criticised for being a colourless, monotonous singer\\".Fifield (ed.), p. 181 In December she sang in the BBC's Christmas Messiah, the last time she would perform this work. On New Year's Day 1953 she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the Queen's New Year Honours List.Leonard, p. 226 =Final performances, illness and death= Orpheus leading Euridice from the underworld Illustration from the 1764 original edition of the score of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice As 1953 began, Ferrier was busy rehearsing for Orpheus, an English language version of Orfeo ed Euridice to be staged in four performances at the Royal Opera House in February. Barbirolli had instigated this project, with Ferrier's enthusiastic approval, some months previously.Leonard, pp. 216 and 228 Her only other engagement in January was a BBC recital recording, in which she sang works by three living English composers: Howard Ferguson, William Wordsworth and Edmund Rubbra.Campion, pp. 100‚Äì01 During her regular hospital treatment she discussed with doctors the advisability of an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries), but on learning that the impact on her cancer would probably be insignificant and that her voice might be badly affected, she chose not to have the operation.Leonard, pp. 229‚Äì30 The first Orpheus performance, on 3 February, was greeted with unanimous critical approval. According to Barbirolli, Ferrier was particularly pleased with one critic's comment that her movements were as graceful as any of those of the dancers on stage. However, she was physically weakened from her prolonged radiation treatment; during the second performance, three days later, her left femur partially disintegrated. Quick action by other cast members, who moved to support her, kept the audience in ignorance. Although virtually immobilised, Ferrier sang her remaining arias and took her curtain calls before being transferred to hospital.Fifield (ed.), pp. 183‚Äì84 This proved to be her final public appearance; the two remaining performances, at first rescheduled for April, were eventually cancelled.Leonard, pp. 231‚Äì34 Still the general public remained unaware of the nature of Ferrier's incapacity; an announcement in The Guardian stated: \\"Miss Ferrier is suffering from a strain resulting from arthritis which requires immediate further treatment. It has been caused by the physical stress involved in rehearsal and performance of her role in Orpheus\\". Ferrier spent two months in University College Hospital. As a result, she missed her CBE investiture; the ribbon was brought to her at the hospital by a friend.Leonard, p. 234 Meanwhile, her sister found her a ground- floor apartment in St John's Wood, since she would no longer be able to negotiate the many stairs at Frognal Mansions.Leonard, pp. 235‚Äì36 She moved to her new home in early April, but after only seven weeks was forced to return to hospital where, despite two further operations, her condition continued to deteriorate.Leonard, pp. 241‚Äì45 Early in June she heard that she had been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first female vocalist to receive this honour since Muriel Foster in 1914.Fifield (ed.), p. 185 In a letter to the secretary of the Society she wrote that this \\"unbelievable, wondrous news has done more than anything to make me feel so much better\\".Fifield (ed.), p. 192 This letter, dated 9 June, is probably the last that Ferrier signed herself. As she weakened she saw only her sister and a few very close friends, and, although there were short periods of respite, her decline was unremitting. She died at University College Hospital on 8 October 1953, aged 41; the date for which, while still hopeful of recovery, she had undertaken to sing Frederick Delius's A Mass of Life at the 1953 Leeds Festival.Fifield (ed.), p. 305 Ferrier was cremated a few days later, at Golders Green Crematorium, after a short private service.Leonard, pp. 246‚Äì51 She left an estate worth ¬£15,134, which her biographer Maurice Leonard observes was \\"not a fortune for a world-famous singer, even by the standards of the day\\".Leonard, p. 248 Assessment and legacy Southwark Cathedral, where Ferrier's memorial service was held on 14 November 1953 The news of Ferrier's death came as a considerable shock to the public. Although some in musical circles knew or suspected the truth, the myth had been preserved that her absence from the concert scene was temporary. The opera critic Rupert Christiansen, writing as the 50th anniversary of Ferrier's death approached, maintained that \\"no singer in this country has ever been more deeply loved, as much for the person she was as for the voice she uttered\\". Her death, he continued, \\"quite literally shattered the euphoria of the Coronation\\" (which had taken place on 2 June 1953). Ian Jack, editor of Granta, believed that she \\"may well have been the most celebrated woman in Britain after the Queen.\\" Among the many tributes from her colleagues, that of Bruno Walter has been highlighted by biographers: \\"The greatest thing in music in my life has been to have known Kathleen Ferrier and Gustav Mahler‚Äîin that order.\\"Leonard, p. 246 Very few singers, Lord Harewood writes, \\"have earned so powerful a valedictory from so senior a colleague.\\" At a memorial service at Southwark Cathedral on 14 November 1953 the Bishop of Croydon, in his eulogy, said of Ferrier's voice: \\"She seemed to bring into this world a radiance from another world.\\" From time to time commentators have speculated on the directions Ferrier's career might have taken had she lived. In 1951, while recovering from her mastectomy, she received an offer to sing the part of Brang√§ne in Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde at the 1952 Bayreuth Festival. According to Christiansen she would have been \\"glorious\\" in the role, and was being equally sought by the Bayreuth management to sing Erda in the Ring cycle.Leonard, pp. 197‚Äì98 Christiansen further suggests that, given the changes of style over the past 50 years, Ferrier might have been less successful in the 21st century world: \\"We dislike low-lying voices, for one thing‚Äîcontraltos now sound freakish and headmistressy, and even the majority of mezzo-sopranos should more accurately be categorised as almost-sopranos\\". However, she was \\"a singer of, and for, her time‚Äîa time of grief and weariness, national self-respect and a belief in human nobility\\". In this context \\"her artistry stands upright, austere, unfussy, fundamental and sincere\\". Shortly after Ferrier's death an appeal was launched by Barbirolli, Walter, Myra Hess and others, to establish a cancer research fund in Ferrier's name. Donations were received from all over the world. To publicise the fund a special concert was given at the Royal Festival Hall on 7 May 1954, at which Barbirolli and Walter shared the conducting duties without payment. Among the items was a rendition of Purcell's When I am laid in earth, which Ferrier had often sung; on this occasion the vocal part was played by a solo cor anglais. The Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund helped establish the Kathleen Ferrier Chair of Clinical Oncology at University College Hospital, in 1984. , it was continuing to fund oncology research.Leonard, pp. 246‚Äì49 As the result of a separate appeal, augmented by the sales proceeds of a memoir edited by Neville Cardus, the Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship Fund was created to encourage young British and Commonwealth singers of either sex. The Fund, which has operated from 1956 under the auspices of the Royal Philharmonic Society, initially provided an annual award covering the cost of a year's study to a single prizewinner.Leonard, p. 250 With the advent of additional sponsors, the number and scope of awards has expanded considerably since that time; the list of winners of Ferrier Awards includes many singers of international repute, among them Felicity Palmer, Yvonne Kenny, Lesley Garrett and Bryn Terfel. The Kathleen Ferrier Society, founded in 1993 to promote interest in all aspects of the singer's life and work, has since 1996 awarded annual bursaries to students at Britain's major music colleges. In 2012, the Society organised a series of events to commemorate the centenary of Ferrier's birth and in February 2012 Ferrier was one of ten prominent Britons honoured by the Royal Mail in the \\"Britons of Distinction\\" stamps set. Another was Frederick Delius. A biographic documentary film, Kathleen Ferrier, also known as ' was directed by Diane Perelsztejn and produced by ARTE France in 2012. It featured interviews with her near relatives, friends and colleagues to produce a fresh view of her life and contributions to the arts. Kathleen Ferrier Crescent, in Basildon, Essex, is named in her honour. Recordings Ferrier's discography consists of studio recordings originally made on the Columbia and Decca labels, and recordings taken from live performances which were later issued as discs. In the years since her death, many of her recordings have received multiple reissues on modern media; between 1992 and 1996 Decca issued the Kathleen Ferrier Edition, incorporating much of Ferrier's recorded repertoire, on 10 compact discs. The discographer Paul Campion has drawn attention to numerous works which she performed but did not record, or for which no complete recording has yet surfaced. For example, only one aria from Elgar's Dream of Gerontius, and none of her renderings of 20th century songs by Holst, Bax, Delius and others were recorded. Only a small part of her St John Passion was captured on disc.Campion, pp. 106‚Äì07 The recording of the unaccompanied Northumbrian folk song \\"Blow the Wind Southerly\\", initially made by Decca in 1949, has been reissued many times and frequently played on radio in shows such as Desert Island Discs, Housewives' Choice and Your Hundred Best Tunes.Campion, pp. 43‚Äì44Fifield (ed.), p. 3 Another signature aria, first recorded in 1944 and on numerous subsequent occasions, is \\"What is Life?\\" (Che far√≤) from Orfeo ed Euridice. These records sold in large numbers rivalling those of other stars of the time, such as Frank Sinatra and Vera Lynn. In the 21st century Ferrier's recordings still sell hundreds of thousands of copies each year.

History  Goddard 50th anniversary logo. Goddard is one of four centers built by NASA since its founding on July 29, 1958. It is NASA's first, and oldest, space center. Its original charter was to perform five major functions on behalf of NASA: technology development and fabrication, planning, scientific research, technical operations, and project management. The center is organized into several directorates, each charged with one of these key functions. Until May 1, 1959, NASA's presence in Greenbelt, Maryland was known as the Beltsville Space Center. It was then renamed the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), after Dr. Robert H. Goddard. Its first 157 employees transferred from the United States Navy's Project Vanguard missile program, but continued their work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., while the center was under construction. Goddard Space Flight Center contributed to Project Mercury, America's first manned space flight program. The Center assumed a lead role for the project in its early days and managed the first 250 employees involved in the effort, who were stationed at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. However, the size and scope of Project Mercury soon prompted NASA to build a new Manned Spacecraft Center, now the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, Texas. Project Mercury's personnel and activities were transferred there in 1961. The Goddard network (STDN) tracked many early manned and unmanned spacecraft. Goddard Space Flight Center remained involved in the manned space flight program, providing computer support and radar tracking of flights through a worldwide network of ground stations called the Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network (STDN). However, the Center focused primarily on designing unmanned satellites and spacecraft for scientific research missions. Goddard pioneered several fields of spacecraft development, including modular spacecraft design, which reduced costs and made it possible to repair satellites in orbit. Goddard's Solar Max satellite, launched in 1980, was repaired by astronauts on the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1984. The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, remains in service and continues to grow in capability thanks to its modular design and multiple servicing missions by the Space Shuttle. Today, the center remains involved in each of NASA's key programs. Goddard has developed more instruments for planetary exploration than any other organization, among them scientific instruments sent to every planet in the Solar System. The center's contribution to the Earth Science Enterprise includes several spacecraft in the Earth Observing System fleet as well as EOSDIS, a science data collection, processing, and distribution system. For the manned space flight program, Goddard develops tools for use by astronauts during extra-vehicular activity, and operates the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, a spacecraft designed to study the Moon in preparation for future manned exploration.  Missions  James Webb Space Telescope mirrors assembled, May 2016 A fact sheet highlighting many of Goddard's previous missions are recorded on a 40th anniversary webpage = Past = Goddard has been involved in designing, building, and operating spacecraft since the days of Explorer 1, the nation's first artificial satellite. The list of these missions reflects a diverse set of scientific objectives and goals. The Landsat series of spacecraft has been studying the Earth's resources since the launch of the first mission in 1972. TIROS-1 launched in 1960 as the first success in a long series of weather satellites. The Spartan platform deployed from the space shuttle, allowing simple, low- cost 2-3 day missions. The second of NASA's Great Observatories, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, operated for nine years before re-entering the Earth's atmosphere in 2000. Another of Goddard's space science observatories, the Cosmic Background Explorer, provided unique scientific data about the early universe. = Present = Goddard currently supports the operation of dozens of spacecraft collecting scientific data. These missions include Earth science projects like the Earth Observing System (EOS) that includes the Terra, Aqua, and Aura spacecraft flying alongside several projects from other Centers or other countries. Other major Earth science projects that are currently operating include the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Global Precipitation Measurement mission (GPM), missions that provide data critical to hurricane predictions. Many Goddard projects support other organizations, such as the US Geological Survey on Landsat-7 and -8, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system that provide weather predictions. Other Goddard missions support a variety of space science disciplines. Goddard's most famous project is the Hubble Space Telescope, a unique science platform that has been breaking new ground in astronomy for nearly 20 years. Other missions such as the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) study the structure and evolution of the universe. Other missions such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) are currently studying the Sun and how its behavior affects life on the Earth. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is mapping out the composition and topography of the Moon and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is tracking the Sun's energy and influence on the Earth. = Future = The Goddard community continually works on numerous operations and projects that have launch dates ranging from the upcoming year to a decade down the road. These operations also vary in what scientists hope they will uncover. Particularly noteworthy operations include: the James Webb Space Telescope which will try to study the history of the universe.  Science  In this video, two Goddard technologists explain what innovation means and why it is so important to NASA Addressing Scientific Questions NASA's missions (and therefore Goddard's missions) address a broad range of scientific questions generally classified around four key areas: Earth sciences, astrophysics, heliophysics, and the Solar System. To simplify, Goddard studies Earth and Space. Within the Earth sciences area, Goddard plays a major role in research to advance our understanding of the Earth as an environmental system, looking at questions related to how the components of that environmental system have developed, how they interact and how they evolve. This is all important to enable scientists to understand the practical impacts of natural and human activities during the coming decades and centuries. Within Space Sciences, Goddard has distinguished itself with the 2006 Nobel Physics Prize given to John Mather and the COBE mission. Beyond the COBE mission, Goddard studies how the universe formed, what it is made of, how its components interact, and how it evolves. The center also contributes to research seeking to understand how stars and planetary systems form and evolve and studies the nature of the Sun's interaction with its surroundings. From Scientific Questions to Science Missions Based on existing knowledge accumulated through previous missions, new science questions are articulated. Missions are developed in the same way an experiment would be developed using the scientific method. In this context, Goddard does not work as an independent entity but rather as one of the 10 NASA centers working together to find answers to these scientific questions. Each mission starts with a set of scientific questions to be answered, a set of scientific requirements for the mission, which build on what has already been discovered by prior missions. Scientific requirements spell out the types data that will need to be collected. These scientific requirements are then transformed into mission concepts that start to specify the kind of spacecraft and scientific instruments need to be developed for these scientific questions to be answered. Within Goddard, the Sciences and Exploration Directorate (SED) leads the center's scientific endeavors, including the development of technology related to scientific pursuits. Collecting Data in Space ‚Äì Scientific Instruments Some of the most important technological advances developed by Goddard (and NASA in general) come from the need to innovate with new scientific instruments in order to be able to observe or measure phenomena in space that have never been measured or observed before. Instrument names tend to be known by their initials. In some cases, the mission's name gives an indication of the type of instrument involved. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope is, as its name indicates, a telescope, but it includes a suite of four distinct scientific instruments: Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI); Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam); Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec); Fine Guidance Sensor and Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS- NIRISS). Scientists at Goddard work closely with the engineers to develop these instruments. Typically, a mission consists of a spacecraft with an instrument suite (multiple instruments) on board. In some cases, the scientific requirements dictate the need for multiple spacecraft. For example, the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) studies magnetic reconnection, a 3-D process. In order to capture data about this complex 3-D process, a set of four spacecraft fly in a tetrahedral formation. Each of the four spacecraft carries identical instrument suites. MMS is part of a larger program (Solar Terrestrial Probes) that studies the impact of the Sun on the Solar System. Goddard's Scientific Collaborations In many cases, Goddard works with partners (US Government agencies, aerospace industry, university-based research centers, other countries) that are responsible for developing the scientific instruments. In other cases, Goddard develops one or more of the instruments. The individual instruments are then integrated into an instrument suite which is then integrated with the spacecraft. In the case of MMS, for example, Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) was responsible for developing the scientific instruments and Goddard provides overall project management, mission systems engineering, the spacecraft, and mission operations. On the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), six instruments have been developed by a range of partners. One of the instruments, the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), was developed by Goddard. LOLA measures landing site slopes and lunar surface roughness in order to generate a 3-D map of the moon. Another mission to be managed by Goddard is MAVEN. MAVEN is the second mission within the Mars Scout Program that is exploring the atmosphere of Mars in support of NASA's broader efforts to go to Mars. MAVEN carries eight instruments to measure characteristics of Mars' atmospheric gases, upper atmosphere, solar wind, and ionosphere. Instrument development partners include the University of Colorado at Boulder, and the University of California, Berkeley. Goddard contributed overall project management as well as two of the instruments, two magnetometers. Managing Scientific Data Once a mission is launched and reaches its destination, its instruments start collecting data. The data is transmitted back to Earth where it needs to be analyzed and stored for future reference. Goddard manages large collections of scientific data resulting from past and ongoing missions. The Earth Science Division hosts the Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Division (GES DISC). It offers Earth science data, information, and services to research scientists, applications scientists, applications users, and students. The National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC), created at Goddard in 1966, hosts a permanent archive of space science data, including a large collection of images from space.  Spinoff technologies  Section 102(d) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 calls for \\"the establishment of long-range studies of the potential benefits to be gained from, the opportunities for, and the problems involved in the utilization of aeronautical and space activities for peaceful and scientific purposes.\\" Because of this mandate, the Technology Utilization Program was established in 1962 which required technologies to be brought down to Earth and commercialized in order to help the US economy and improve the quality of life. Documentation of these technologies that were spun off started in 1976 with \\"Spinoff 1976\\". Since then, NASA has produced a yearly publication of these \\"spinoff technologies\\" through the Innovative Partnerships Program Office. Goddard Space Flight Center has made significant contributions to the US economy and quality of life with the technologies it has spun off. Here are some examples: Weather balloon technology has helped firefighters with its short-range radios; aluminized Mylar in satellites has made sports equipment more insulated; laser optics systems have transformed the camera industry and life detection missions on other planets help scientists find bacteria in contaminated food.  Facilities  Goddard's partly wooded campus is a few miles northeast of Washington, D.C. in Prince George's County. The center is on Greenbelt Road, which is Maryland Route 193. Baltimore, Annapolis, and NASA Headquarters in Washington are 30‚Äì45 minutes away by highway. Greenbelt also has a train station with access to the Washington Metro system and the MARC commuter train's Camden line. = Testing chambers and Manufacturing Buildings = The High Bay Cleanroom located in building 29 is the world's largest ISO 7 cleanroom with 1.3 million cubic feet of space. Vacuum chambers in adjacent buildings 10 and 7 can be chilled or heated to +/- . Adjacent building 15 houses the High Capacity Centrifuge which is capable of generating 30 G on up to a 2.5 tons load. Parsons Corporation assisted in the construction of the Class 10,000 cleanroom to support Hubble Space Telescope as well as other Goddard missions. = High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center = The High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC) is NASA's designated center for the archiving and dissemination of high energy astronomy data and information. Information on X-ray and gamma ray astronomy and related NASA mission archives are maintained for public information and science access. = Software Assurance Technology Center = The Software Assurance Technology Center (SATC) is a NASA department founded in 1992 as part of their Systems Reliability and Safety Office at Goddard Space Flight Center. Its purpose was \\"to become a center of excellence in software assurance, dedicated to making measurable improvement in both the quality and reliability of software developed for NASA at GSFC\\". The center has been the source of research papers on software metrics, assurance, and risk management. = Goddard Visitor Center = Hubble model on display in visitor center. Promotional video for the visitor center. Delta rocket on display in the rocket garden. The Goddard Visitor Center is open to the public Tuesdays through Sundays, free of charge, and features displays of spacecraft and technologies developed there. The Hubble Space Telescope is represented by models and deep space imagery from recent missions. The center also features a Science On a Sphere projection system. The center also features an Educator's Resource Center available for use by teachers and education volunteers such as Boy and Girl Scout leaders; and hosts special events during the year. As an example, in September 2008 the Center opened its gates for Goddard LaunchFest (see Goddard LaunchFest Site). The event, free to the public, included; robot competitions, tours of Goddard facilities hosted by NASA employees, and live entertainment on the Goddard grounds. GSFC also has a large ballroom for guest events such as lectures, presentations and dinner parties.https://catalog.archives.gov/id/18431206 = External facilities = GSFC operates three facilities that are not located at the Greenbelt site. These facilities are: *The Wallops Flight Facility located in Wallops Island, Virginia was established in 1945, and is one of the oldest launch sites in the world. Wallops manages NASA's sounding rocket program, and supports approximately 35 missions each year. *The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) located at Columbia University in New York City, where much of the center's theoretical research is conducted. Operated in close association with Columbia and other area universities, the institute provides support research in geophysics, astrophysics, astronomy and meteorology. *The Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility (IV&V;) in Fairmont, West Virginia was established in 1993 to improve the safety, reliability, and quality of software used in NASA missions. GSFC is also responsible for the White Sands Complex, a set of two sites in Las Cruces, NM, but the site is owned by Johnson Space Center as part of the White Sands Test Facility.  Employees  Goddard Space Flight Center has a workforce of over 3,000 civil servant employees, 60% of whom are engineers and scientists. There are approximately 7,000 supporting contractors on site every day. It is one of the largest concentrations of the world's premier space scientists and engineers. The center is organized into 8 directorates, which includes Applied Engineering and Technology, Flight Projects, Science and Exploration, and Safety & Mission Assurance. Co-op students from universities in all 50 States can be found around the campus every season through the Cooperative Education Program. During the summers, programs such as the Summer Institute in Engineering and Computer Applications (SIECA) and Excellence through Challenging Exploration and Leadership (EXCEL) provide internship opportunities to students from the US and territories such as Puerto Rico to learn and partake in challenging scientific and engineering work.  Community  The Goddard Space Flight Center maintains ties with local area communities through external volunteer and educational programs. Employees are encouraged to take part in mentoring programs and take on speaking roles at area schools. On Center, Goddard hosts regular colloquiums in engineering, leadership and science. These events are open to the general public, but attendees must sign up in advance to procure a visitors pass for access to the center's main grounds. Passes can be obtained at the security office main gate on Greenbelt Road. Goddard also hosts several different internship opportunities, including NASA DEVELOP at Goddard Space Flight Center.  Queen Elizabeth II's visit  Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and her husband Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited Goddard Space Flight Center on Tuesday, May 8, 2007. The tour of Goddard was near the end of the queen's visit to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown in Virginia. The queen spoke with crew aboard the International Space Station.NASA Press Release on Queen Elizabeth II Visit Goddard, May 8, 2007 - Note: The visit followed a signing on April 19 of a statement of intent between NASA and the British National Space Centre, London, that confirmed a mutual desire for discussions on specific areas of potential collaboration involving lunar science and exploration.

LaRC has focused primarily on aeronautical research, but has also tested space hardware at the facility, such as the Apollo Lunar Module. In addition, a number of the earliest high-profile space missions were planned and designed on-site, and Langley was considered a potential site for the NASA's Manned Space Center prior to the eventual selection of Houston. Established in 1917 by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the research center devotes two-thirds of its programs to aeronautics, and the rest to space. LaRC researchers use more than 40 wind tunnels to study and improve aircraft and spacecraft safety, performance, and efficiency. Between 1958 and 1963, when NASA (the successor agency to NACA) started Project Mercury, LaRC served as the main office of the Space Task Group. In September 2019, after previously serving as associate director and deputy director, Clayton P. Turner was appointed director of NASA Langley.  History  A variety of research aircraft at NASA Langley in 1994 After US-German relations had deteriorated from neutral to hostile around 1916, the prospect of U.S. war entry became possible. On February 15, 1917, the newly established Aviation Week warned that the U.S. military aviation capability was less than what was operating in the European war.Aviation & Aeronautical Engineering, February 15, 1917 President Woodrow Wilson sent Jerome Hunsaker to Europe to investigate, and Hunsaker's report prompted Wilson to command the creation of the nation's first aeronautics laboratory, which became NASA Langley. In 1917, less than three years after it was created, the NACA established Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory on Langley Field. Both Langley Field and the Langley Laboratory are named for aviation pioneer Samuel Pierpont Langley. The Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps had established a base there earlier that same year. The first research facilities were in place and aeronautical research was started by 1920. Initially the laboratory included four researchers and 11 technicians. LaRC's subsonic wind tunnel Langley Field and NACA began parallel growth as air power proved its utility during World War I. The center was originally established to explore the field of aerodynamic research involving airframe and propulsion engine design and performance. In 1934 the world's largest wind tunnel was constructed at Langley Field with a test section; it was large enough to test full-scale aircraft.\\"Faster, Safer Planes, Developed In Biggest Wind Tunnels\\" Popular Science, April 1934\\"Full- Size Planes Tested In Big Air Tunnel\\" Popular Mechanics, April 1935, pp. 520‚Äì521 It remained the world's largest wind tunnel until the 1940s, when a tunnel was built at NASA Ames Research Center in California. Early in 1945, the center expanded to include rocket research, leading to the establishment of a flight station at Wallops Island, Virginia. A further expansion of the research program permitted Langley Research Center to orbit payloads, starting with NASA's Explorer 9 balloon satellite in mid-February 1961. As rocket research grew, aeronautics research continued to expand and played an important part when subsonic flight was advanced and supersonic and hypersonic flight were introduced. Langley Research Center can claim many historic firsts, some of which have proven to be revolutionary scientific breakthroughs. These accomplishments include the development of the concept of research aircraft leading to supersonic flight, the world's first transonic wind tunnels, training the first crews of astronauts, the Lunar Landing Facility providing the simulation of lunar gravity, and the Viking program for Mars exploration. The center also developed standards for the grooving of aircraft runways based on a previous British design used at Washington National Airport. Grooved runways reduce aquaplaning which permits better grip by aircraft tires in heavy rain. This grooving is now the international standard for all runways around the world. Langley was also a contender for site NASA Mission Control, prior to the eventual selection of Houston, due to both Langley's prominence with NASA at the time, the large existing aerospace industry already present in the Hampton Roads region, and the proximity to Washington, DC. The selection of Houston actually took many higherups at Langley by surprise and caused some lingering controversy in the surrounding area over the loss and transfer of so many jobs to Houston. Though they had lost out on the Manned Space Center, Langley still played an important role in conducting research and training during the Apollo Program. Aeronautics X-43 spaceplane in LaRC's high temperature wind tunnel. Langley Research Center performs critical research on aeronautics, including wake vortex behavior, fixed-wing aircraft, rotary wing aircraft, aviation safety, human factors and aerospace engineering. LaRC supported the design and testing of the hypersonic X-43, which achieved a world speed record of . LaRC assisted the NTSB in the investigation of the crash of American Airlines Flight 587. Work began in July 2011 to remove the 1940s era transonic wind tunnel. The facility supported development and propulsion integration research for many military aircraft including all fighters since 1960 (F-14, F-15, F-16, F-18 and the Joint Strike Fighter) but had been inactive since 2004. Langley retained transonic wind tunnel testing capabilities facilities in the National Transonic Facility, a high pressure, cryogenically cooled closed loop wind tunnel. Fabrication research and development LRC materials research lab =Electron beam freeform fabrication (EBF¬≥)= The EBF¬≥ process produces structural metallic parts with immense strength. Additionally, the ability to build functionally graded, unitized parts directly from CAD data offers performance in most applications. Recently, LaRC has become home to this type of machining process, which is used by their new room-sized electron-emitting device, which uses a High Frequency , X-ray emitting electron gun (similar to Cathode Ray Tubes), which quickly melts either aluminum or titanium wire (positioned by dual independent wire feeders) into the desired 3-dimensional metallic parts with a material strength comparable to that of wrought products. The machine's deposition rate is Metallic parts are also built directly from CAD without molds or tools, leaving the end product with absolutely no porosity. =Plastic fabrication= LaRC also houses a large collection of various inexpensive plastic reformation machines. These machines are critical in the freeform fabrication department for faster timing, better precision, and larger quantities of low-cost toy, model, and industrial plastic parts. The fabrication of plastic parts is not all that dissimilar to the EBF¬≥ process, except the melting apparatus is a thin, grated heating element, but other than that they are quite similar, e.g. they are both run completely by CAD data and deal with various freeform fabrication of raw materials. Astronautics = Moon = Gantry used in lunar landing training as well as testing of land-based landings of the Orion spacecraft Since the start of Project Gemini, Langley was a center for training of rendezvous in space. In 1965, Langley opened the Lunar Landing Research Facility for simulations of Moon landings with a mock Apollo Lunar Module suspended from a gantry over a simulated lunar landscape. There was experimental work on some Lunar Landing Research Vehicles (LLRV). = Mars = Langley Research Center supported NASA's mission by designing a spacecraft for a Mars landing. (see the Mars Exploration Rover.) =Earth science= Langley Research Center conducts Earth science research to support NASA's mission. Awards LRC scientists and engineers have won the Collier Trophy 5 times. In 1929 for the development of low-drag cowling for radial air-cooled aircraft engines, 1946 to Lewis A. Rodert, Lawrence D. Bell and Chuck Yeager for the development of an efficient wing deicing system, 1947 to John Stack of the then Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory for research to determine the physical laws affecting supersonic flight, also shared in this trophy for their work on supersonic flight, 1951 to John Stack for the development and use of the slotted-throat wind tunnel, 1954 Richard T. Whitcomb for the development of the Whitcomb area rule, according to the citation, a \\"powerful, simple, and useful method of reducing greatly the sharp increase in wing drag heretofore associated with transonic flight, and which constituted a major factor requiring great reserves of power to attain supersonic speeds.\\" See also * Aerospace engineering * NASA field centers and other facilities * TsAGI Russia's equivalent test center and research institute References External links * Langley Research Center website * Langley Archives Collection at Cultural Resources Geographical Information Systems (CRGIS), NASA * James R.

Figurines have been made in many media, with clay, metal, wood, glass, and today plastic or resin the most significant. Ceramic figurines not made of porcelain are called terracottas in historical contexts. Figures with movable parts, allowing limbs to be posed, are more likely to be called dolls, mannequins, or action figures; or robots or automata, if they can move on their own. Figurines and miniatures are sometimes used in board games, such as chess, and tabletop role playing games. The main difference between a figurine and a statue is size. Prehistory Prehistoric Venus of Willendorf figurine In China, there are extant Neolithic figurines.Li Liu, The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States, 2004, Cambridge University Press, 328 pages European prehistoric figurines of women, some appearing pregnant, are called Venus figurines, because of their presumed connection to fertility. The two oldest known examples are made of stone, were found in Africa and Asia, and are several hundred thousand years old. Many made of fired clay have been found in Europe that date to 25-30,000 BC, and are the oldest ceramics known. Olmec figurines in semi-precious stones and pottery had a wide influence all over Mesoamerica about 1000-500 BC, and were apparently usually kept in houses. These early figurines are among the first signs of human culture. One cannot know in some cases how they were used. They probably had religious or ceremonial significance and may have been used in many types of rituals. Many are found in burials. Some may have been worn as jewelry or intended to amuse children. History Porcelain and other ceramics are common materials for figurines. Ancient Greek terracotta figurines, made in moulds, were a large industry by the Hellenistic period, and ones in bronze also very common. In Roman art bronze came to predominate. Most of these were religious, and deposited in large numbers in temples as votives, or kept in the home and sometimes buried with their owner. But types such as Tanagra figurines included many purely decorative subjects, such as fashionable ladies. There are many early examples from China, mainly religious figures in Dehua porcelain, which drove the experimentation in Europe to replicate the process. The first European porcelain figurines, were produced in Meissen porcelain, initially in a plain glazed white, but soon brightly painted in overglaze \\"enamels\\", and were soon produced by neally all European porcelain factories. The initial function of these seems to have been as permanent versions of sugar sculptures which were used to decorate tables on special occasions by European elites, but they soon found a place on mantelpieces and side tables. There was already some production of earthenware figures in English delftware and stoneware, for example by John Dwight of the Fulham Pottery in London, and after 1720 such figures became more popular. By around 1750 pottery figures were being produced in large numbers all over Europe. Staffordshire figures were cheaper versions in earthenware, and by the late 19th century especially noted for Staffordshire dog figurines. Genre figurines of gallant scenes, beggars or figurines of saints are carved from pinewood in Val Gardena, South Tyrol (Italy), since the 17th century. Modern era Modern figurines, particularly those made of plastic, are often referred to as figures. They can encompass modern action figures and other model figures as well as Precious Moments and Hummel figurines, Bobbleheads, Sebastian Miniatures and other kinds of memorabilia. Some companies which produce porcelain figurines are Royal Doulton, Lladr√≥ and Camal Enterprises. Figurines of comic book or sci-fi/fantasy characters without movable parts have been referred to by the terms inaction figures (originally used to describe Kevin Smith's View Askew figurines) and staction figures (a portmanteau of statue and action figures coined by Four Horsemen artists to describe Masters of the Universe figures). There is also a hobby known as mini war gaming in which players use figurines in table top based games. These figurines are mostly made of plastic and pewter. However, some premium models are made of resin. Figurines can also represent racial and ethnic slurs, for example, Jew with a coin figurines, and Mammy figurines.

This process is the photographic equivalent of a cylindrical map projection in cartography. It is used predominantly for the projection of images of cylindrical objects such as vases or ceramic vessels. The objective of this process is to present to the observer a planar representation of the object's characteristics, most notably the illustrations or artwork extant on the outside surfaces of such vessels. This planar representation is captured using photographic imaging techniques.Kerr, Justin. \\"A Short History of Rollout Photography\\". famsi.org. Retrieved 2011-04-16. Technique In the basic technique, using strip photography, a camera with a vertical slit aperture is positioned opposite a turntable on which an object is centered. Both the object and the camera are oriented as precisely as possible so as to eliminate aberrations due to the focusing mechanism of the camera, the aperture, and the characteristics of the object itself. As the object is rotated on the turntable, the film is exposed in small intervals corresponding to the dimensions of the aperture. Since the image is projected onto the film backwards and upside down, the turntable spins in the direction opposite of the direction of the film advance mechanism. History In 1972, Justin Kerr worked with author & anthropologist Michael D. Coe to produce a book on ceramic vessels of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization. For this book Kerr had to photograph the ceramics section by section, and then have an artist combine the pictures into one. Since this was slow and did not accurately reproduce the images on the pottery, Kerr set out to find a technique that would make a single, fluid picture. However, at this time no cameras existed that were capable of making peripheral photographs. Therefore, from 1972‚Äì1978, Kerr created a new camera and essentially reinvented the art of rollout photography. Example of a rollout photo of a Classic Maya vase The technique had existed for years, so by using the methods listed above Justin Kerr succeeded in making a camera that captured the first Maya pottery vessel using rollout photography. The rollout technique was perfected through the use of a record turntable, clamps, and various pieces of wood and belts. The end result was a clear and accurate reproduction of a tin can. From there Kerr moved on to Maya vessels. Each vase takes about two minutes to photograph, and is done all in one session. Kerr spends on average 6 hours a day in his studio working on Maya rollouts. Subsequently, Kerr began archiving every container he photographed. To date more than 1400 rollouts have been created. His first successful print was of an Olmec bowl, lent to him from Princeton University.

It is the principle that no person should be judged without a fair hearing in which each party is given the opportunity to respond to the evidence against them. \\"Audi alteram partem\\" is considered to be a principle of fundamental justice or equity or the principle of natural justice in most legal systems.

With increased wealth and more complicated trade relations and social structures, Greek city-states tended to overthrow their traditional hereditary priest-kings; Corinth, the richest archaic polis, led the way.J. B. Salmon, Wealthy Corinth. A History of the City to 338 B.C. (Oxford: Clarendon Press) 1984. Like the signori of late medieval and Renaissance Italy, the tyrants usually seized power at the head of some popular support. Often the tyrants upheld existing laws and customs and were highly conservative as to cult practices, thus maintaining stability with little risk to their own personal security. As in Renaissance Italy, a cult of personality naturally substituted for the divine right of the former legitimate royal house. After the last traditional king of Corinth, Telestes, was assassinated by Arieus and Perantas, there were no more kings; instead prytanes taken from the former royal house of the Bacchiadae ruled for a single year each. Cypselus, the son of E√´tion and a disfigured woman named Labda, who was a member of the Bacchiad family, the ruling dynasty, usurped power, became tyrant and expelled the Bacchiadae. According to Herodotus the Bacchiadae heard two prophecies from the Delphic oracle that the son of E√´tion would overthrow their dynasty, and they planned to kill the baby once it was born; however, Herodotus says that the newborn smiled at each of the men sent to kill it, and none of them could go through with the plan. An etiological myth-element, to account for the name Cypselus (cf. Œ∫œÖœà·ºêŒªŒ∑, kypsele, \\"chest\\") accounted how Labda then hid the baby in a chest, and when the men had composed themselves and returned to kill it, they could not find it. (Compare the infancy of Perseus.) The cedar chest of Cypselus, richly worked with mythological narratives and adorned with ivory and gold, was a votive offering at Olympia, where Pausanias gave it a detailed description in his 2nd century AD travel guide.Pausanias, 5.18.7. When Cypselus had grown up, he fulfilled the prophecy. Corinth had been involved in wars with Argos and Corcyra, and the Corinthians were unhappy with their rulers. At the time, around 657 BC, Cypselus was polemarch, the archon in charge of the military, and he used his influence with the soldiery to expel the Bacchiadae. He also expelled his other enemies, but allowed them to set up colonies in northwestern Greece. He also increased trade with the colonies in Italy and Sicily. He ruled for thirty years and in 627 BC was succeeded as tyrant by his son Periander, who was considered one of the Seven Sages of Greece. The treasury Cypselus built at Delphi was apparently still standing in the time of Herodotus. Cypselus' second son Gorgus became tyrant of the Corinthian colony Ambracia, followed after his death by his son Periander of Ambracia. Cypselus' other grandson by Gorgus was Psammetich, who followed the sage Periander as the last tyrant of Corinth.

He rode a large-wheeled Ordinary, also known as a penny-farthing, from April 1884 to December 1886.The Bicycle, UK, 11 September 1946, p. 6 He later searched for Henry Morton Stanley in Africa, investigated the claims of Indian ascetics and became manager of the Garrick Theatre in London. Origins Stevens, known as Tom, was born in Castle Street, Berkhamsted, the son of William and Ann Stevens. His father was a labourer. Thomas had an older sister, Bridget, and younger, Jane. He went to Bourne Charity School, then became an apprentice grocer. His father emigrated to Missouri in 1868 but returned when his wife became ill and before the rest of the family could also go to America. Tom went with a half-brother but without his parents and sisters in 1871 and the rest of the family followed two years later. They moved to Denver and then to San Francisco, where he learned to ride a bicycle. Adventure Cyclist described him as \\"a man of medium height, wearing an oversized blue flannel shirt over blue overalls, which were tucked into a pair of leggings at the knee [and] tanned ' as a nut.'A mustache protruded from his face.\\" It said: \\"A two-year stint in a Wyoming railroad mill ended when he was run out of town after it became known that he was importing British labourers in exchange for part of their salaries. He later found work in a Colorado mine where he came up with the idea of riding a bicycle across the country.\\" Around the World Steven's route around the world =America= In 1884 he acquired a black-enameled Columbia 50-inch 'Standard' penny-farthing with nickel-plated wheels, built by the Pope Manufacturing Company of Chicago. He packed his handlebar bag with socks, a spare shirt, a raincoat that doubled as tent and bedroll, and a pocket revolver (described as a \\"bull-dog revolver\\", perhaps a British Bull Dog revolver) and left San Francisco at 8 o'clock on 22 April 1884. From Sacramento, Stevens travelled through the Sierra Nevada Mountains to Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. En route, he was greeted by members of local bicycle clubs, most prominently the president of a chapter of the League of American Wheelmen in Laramie, Wyoming. He had never seen North America east of the Mississippi. He reached Boston after 3,700 miles on wagon trails, railways, canal towpaths and public roads, to complete the first transcontinental bicycle ride on 4 August 1884. Harper's reported: \\"More than one-third of the route followed by Mr. Stevens had to be walked. Eighty-three and a half days of actual travel and twenty days' stoppage for wet weather, etc., made one hundred and three and a half days occupied in reaching Boston, the distance by wagon-road being about 3,700 miles. He followed the old California trail most of the way across the plains and mountains, astonishing the Indians, and meeting with many strange adventures.\\" Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who heard Stevens speak at the Massachusetts Bicycle Club, said: \\"He seemed like Jules Verne, telling his own wonderful performances, or like a contemporary Sinbad the Sailor. We found that modern mechanical invention, instead of disenchanting the universe, had really afforded the means of exploring its marvels the more surely. Instead of going round the world with a rifle, for the purpose of killing something ‚Äì or with a bundle of tracts, in order to convert somebody ‚Äì this bold youth simply went round the globe to see the people who were on it; and since he always had something to show them as interesting as anything that they could show him, he made his way among all nations.\\" =Europe= Stevens passed the winter in New York and contributed sketches of his transcontinental trip to Outing, a cycling magazine. It made him a special correspondent and sent him on the steamer City of Chicago to Liverpool. He landed there 10 days later, on 9 April 1885. He left his bicycle in the underground storerooms of the London and North Western Railway and went by train to London to arrange his crossing of Europe and investigate conditions in Asia. He was helped by an interpreter at the Chinese embassy who discouraged him from riding across Upper Burma and China. He returned to Liverpool on 30 April 1885 and on 4 May made a formal start to his ride at Edge Hill church, where several hundred people watched him leave. He wrote: :A small sea of hats is enthusiastically waved aloft; a ripple of applause escaped from 500 English throats as I mount my glistening bicycle; and with the assistance of a few policemen, 25 Liverpool cyclers who have assembled to accompany me out extricate themselves from the crowd, mount, and fall into line two abreast; and merrily we wheel down Edge-lane and out of Liverpool.\\"Stevens, Thomas (1888), Around the World on a Bicycle, cited The Bicycle, UK, 11 September 1946, p.6 It began raining within minutes. He rode, wearing a white military helmet In parts of England he was mistaken for General Wolseley, who had made a name for himself in \\"the East.\\" through England, passing through Berkhamsted, where he had been born. He recorded that roads in England were better than in America. He took the ferry from Newhaven to Dieppe to cross to France and continued through Germany, Austria, Hungary (where he picked up a temporary cycling companion with whom he shared no language), Slavonia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Rumelia, Turkey. In Constantinople he rested among people who had heard of America, refitted with spare spokes, tires and other parts and a better pistol (a .38 calibre Smith & Wesson), waited for reports of banditry to subside, and then pedalled off through Anatolia, Armenia, Kurdistan, Iraq and Iran, where he waited out the winter in Teheran as a guest of the Shah. =Afghanistan= Having been refused permission to travel through Siberia, he set off on 10 March 1886 through Afghanistan although its borders were closed to foreigners and its guards had a fierce reputation. Upon entering the country, Stevens was arrested. As guards took him to his place of detainment, he entertained them with a demonstration of his bicycle, pedalling far ahead of them until an officer caught up on horse and had him wait for the on-foot soldiers to catch up. He was kept in a villa where he was fed well and gifted new boots, soap and biscuits imported from England. A fine horse was kept in the garden aside his quarters that he might enjoy looking at. Finally ejected from Afghanistan, Stevens was accompanied back to Persia. Again, he was allowed to speed ahead of his captors so long as he stopped and waited for them occasionally. Eventually, however, the soldiers grew nervous and disassembled his bicycle, strapping the pieces to a packhorse, which later laid upon the larger wheel, breaking many spokes, the most severe damage the penny-farthing experienced upon the trip. Afghan gunsmiths drilled new wholed and stretched new spokes. Some spokes remained subpar, though sufficient to complete the thousands of miles yet ahead. =Asia= A drawn depiction of Thomas Stevens in Japan, from the book about his travels He took a Russian steamer across the Caspian to Baku; rail to Batoum; steamer to Constantinople and India. In the Red Sea his knowledge of mules was useful to the British Army. He cycled across India, noting that the weather was always hot and the Grand Trunk Road was excellent wheeling and free from bandits. Much of his description of life in India, however, suffers from being based on the opinions of experts rather than his own observations. Another steamer brought him from Calcutta to Hong Kong and southern China. He pedalled to eastern China, encountering great difficulty in asking directions in a language he couldn't pronounce. A Chinese official gave him refuge from rioters who were angry over a war with the French. From the coast he took a steamer to Japan, where he delighted in the calm of that country. The bicycle part of his journey around the world ends 17 December 1886, at Yokohama. His itinerary accounts \\"DISTANCE ACTUALLY WHEELED, ABOUT 13,500 MILES\\". Stevens returned by steamer to San Francisco, in January 1887. Stevens' travels through Japan were reported in the Jijishinpou newspaper. Along the way, Stevens sent a series of letters to Harper's Magazine detailing his experiences and later collected those experiences into a two-volume book of 1,000 pages, Around the World on a Bicycle, which is available in a single- volume paperback and publicly available at digital library projects. The price of an original has been estimated at between $US300 and $US400 The Pope Company preserved Stevens's bicycle until World War II, when it was donated to a scrap drive to support the war effort. The search for Stanley The New York World asked Thomas in 1888 to join its search in East Africa for the explorer Henry Morton Stanley. Stanley had travelled up the Congo but a year and a half had passed without news. Stevens called it \\"a grand opportunity; the one chance, mayhap, of a lifetime, to spring into fame on the stage of African exploit. How would I Found Stanley look in the libraries with I Found Livingstone?\\"Stanley had found the explorer David Livingstone and greeted him with \\"Livingstone, I presume?\\" Stevens left New York by ship on 5 January 1889.Stevens, Thomas (1890), Scouting for Stanley, Cassell Publishing, New York City, p1 His instructions, he said, were: :Go to Zanzibar. Investigate the state of affairs there. Let us know the truth about the troubles between the Germans and the Arabs. See what is to be seen of the slave trade. Find out all you can about Stanley and Emin Pasha, and, if necessary or advisable, organise an expedition and penetrate the interior for reliable news of the Emin Pasha Relief expedition. Spare no expense in carrying out the main object of the enterprise, but at the same time don't throw money away recklessly.Stevens, Thomas (1890), Scouting for Stanley, Cassell Publishing, New York City, p2 Stevens led a six-month expedition, writing for the newspaper of climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and hunting big game. He found Stanley's camp in a race with the rival New York Herald and wrote his book, Scouting for Stanley in East AfricaCassell Publishing Company, New York, 1890 It concluded: :By the end of February 1890, I was again in New York. I had been gone fourteen months. I had not 'found Stanley,' as Stanley had found Livingstone in 1871; the circumstances were altogether different. I had, however, gratified a pardonable journalistic ambition in being the first correspondent to reach him and to give him news of the world, after his long period of African darkness. That I had done this under most trying conditions, Mr. Stanley fully appreciated; and warmly reciprocated by showing me every courtesy in his power, on the march to the coast, in Zanzibar, and in Egypt.Stevens, Thomas (1890), Scouting for Stanley, Cassell Publishing, New York City, p288 Stevens then reported from Russia, sailed the rivers of Europe, and investigated miracles claimed by Indian ascetics. His conclusions that \\"the stories of travelers, from Marco Polo to the latest witness of Indian miracles...are quite true\\" were greeted with scepticism and his career faltered. A planned tour of London with his Indian photographs fell through. Return to England Stevens returned to England around 1895 and married Frances Barnes (n√©e Nation), widowed mother of the actresses Irene and Violet Vanbrugh. He became manager of the Garrick Theatre in London. He died in London of cancer of the bladder and was buried at St Marylebone Cemetery in East Finchley, London.

Fig. 2 is a detail of Fig. 1. The exploding-bridgewire detonator (EBW, also known as exploding wire detonator) is a type of detonator used to initiate the detonation reaction in explosive materials, similar to a blasting cap because it is fired using an electric current. EBWs use a different physical mechanism than blasting caps, using more electricity delivered much more rapidly, and explode in a much more precise timing after the electric current is applied, by the process of exploding wire method. This has led to their common use in nuclear weapons. The slapper detonator is a more recent development along similar lines.  History  The EBW was invented by Luis Alvarez and Lawrence Johnston for the Fat Man‚Äìtype bombs of the Manhattan Project, during their work in Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Fat Man Model 1773 EBW detonators used an unusual, high reliability detonator system with two EBW \\"horns\\" attached to a single booster charge, which then fired each of the 32 explosive lens units.  Description  EBWs were developed as a means of detonating multiple explosive charges simultaneously, mainly for use in plutonium-based nuclear weapons in which a plutonium core (called a pit) is compressed very rapidly. This is achieved via conventional explosives placed uniformly around the pit. The implosion must be highly symmetrical or the plutonium would simply be ejected at the low-pressure points. Consequently, the detonators must have very precise timing. An EBW has two main parts: a piece of fine wire which contacts the explosive, and a high-voltage high-current low-impedance electricity source; it must reliably and consistently supply a rapid starting pulse. When the wire is connected across this voltage, the resulting high current melts and then vaporizes the wire in a few microseconds. The resulting shock and heat initiate the high explosive. This accounts for the heavy cables seen in photos of the Trinity \\"Gadget\\"; high voltage cable requires good insulation and they had to deliver a large current with little voltage drop, lest the EBW not achieve the phase transition quickly enough. The precise timing of EBWs is achieved by the detonator using direct physical effects of the vaporized bridgewire to initiate detonation in the detonator's booster charge. Given a sufficiently high and well known amount of electric current and voltage, the timing of the bridgewire vaporization is both extremely short (a few microseconds) and extremely precise and predictable (standard deviation of time to detonate as low as a few tens of nanoseconds). Conventional blasting caps use electricity to heat a bridge wire rather than vaporize it, and that heating then causes the primary explosive to detonate. Imprecise contact between the bridgewire and the primary explosive changes how quickly the explosive is heated up, and minor electrical variations in the wire or leads will change how quickly it heats up as well. The heating process typically takes milliseconds to tens of milliseconds to complete and initiate detonation in the primary explosive. This is roughly 1,000 to 10,000 times longer and less precise than the EBW electrical vaporization. Modern exploding-bridgewire detonators arranged in a tray. = Use in nuclear weapons = Since explosives detonate at typically 7‚Äì8 kilometers per second, or 7‚Äì8 meters per millisecond, a 1 millisecond delay in detonation from one side of a nuclear weapon to the other would be longer than the time the detonation would take to cross the weapon. The time precision and consistency of EBWs (0.1 microsecond or less) are roughly enough time for the detonation to move 1 millimeter at most, and for the most precise commercial EBWs this is 0.025 microsecond and about 0.2 mm variation in the detonation wave. This is sufficiently precise for very low tolerance applications such as nuclear weapon explosive lenses. In the US, due to their common use in nuclear weapons, these devices are subject to the nuclear control authorities in every state, according to the Guidelines for the Export of Nuclear Material, Equipment and Technology. EBWs are on the United States Munitions List, and exports are highly regulated.RISI Technical Topics 11-92 ATF Licenses , accessed Dec 26, 2008 = Civilian use = EBWs have found uses outside nuclear weapons, such as the Titan IV, safety conscious applications where stray electrical currents might detonate normal blasting caps, and applications requiring very precise timing for multiple point commercial blasting in mines or quarries.Teledyne RISI - Selecting the Right EBW Detonator , accessed Dec 26, 2008 EBW detonators are much safer than regular electric detonators because unlike regular detonators EBWs do not have primary explosives. Primary explosives such as lead azide are very sensitive to static electricity, radio frequency, shock, etc.  Mechanism of operation  The bridgewire is usually made of gold, but platinum or gold/platinum alloys can also be used. The most common commercial wire size is 0.038 mm (1.5 mils) in diameter and 1 mm (40 mils) in length, but lengths ranging from 0.25 mm to 2.5 mm (10 mils to 100 mils) can be encountered. From the available explosives, only PETN at low densities can be initiated by sufficiently low shock to make its use practical in commercial systems as a part of the EBW initiator. It can be chained with another explosive booster, often a pellet of tetryl, RDX or some PBX (e.g., PBX 9407). Detonators without such booster are called initial pressing detonators (IP detonators). During initiation, the wire heats with the passing current until melting point is reached. The heating rate is high enough that the liquid metal has no time to flow away, and heats further until it vaporizes. During this phase the electrical resistance of the bridgewire assembly rises. Then an electric arc forms in the metal vapor, leading to drop of electrical resistance and sharp growth of the current, quick further heating of the ionized metal vapor, and formation of a shock wave. To achieve the melting and subsequent vaporizing of the wire in time sufficiently short to create a shock wave, a current rise rate of at least 100 amperes per microsecond is required. If the current rise rate is lower, the bridge may burn, perhaps causing deflagration of the PETN pellet, but it will not cause detonation. PETN-containing EBWs are also relatively insensitive to a static electricity discharge. Their use is limited by the thermal stability range of PETN. Slapper detonators, which can use high density hexanitrostilbene, may used in temperatures up to almost in environments ranging from vacuum to high pressures. Firing system The EBW and the slapper detonator are the safest known types of detonators, as only a very high-current fast-rise pulse can successfully trigger them. However, they require a bulky power source for the current surges required. The extremely short rise times are usually achieved by discharging a low-inductance, high- capacitance, high-voltage capacitor (e.g., oil-filled, Mylar-foil, or ceramic) through a suitable switch (spark gap, thyratron, krytron, etc.) into the bridge wire. A very rough approximation for the capacitor is a rating of 5 kilovolts and 1 microfarad, and the peak current ranges between 500 and 1000 amperes. The high voltage may be generated using a Marx generator. Low- impedance capacitors and low-impedance coaxial cables are required to achieve the necessary current rise rate. The flux compression generator is one alternative to capacitors. When fired, it creates a strong electromagnetic pulse, which is inductively coupled into one or more secondary coils connected to the bridge wires or slapper foils. A low energy density capacitor equivalent to a compression generator would be roughly the size of a soda can. The energy in such a capacitor would be ¬∑C¬∑V, which for the above-mentioned capacitor is 12.5 J. (By comparison, a defibrillator delivers ~200 J from 2 kV and perhaps 20 ¬µF. The flash-strobe in a disposable camera is typically 3 J from a 300 V capacitor of 100 ¬µF.) In a fission bomb, the same or similar circuit is used for powering the neutron trigger, the initial source of fission neutrons.

Abbot went from being director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, to becoming Assistant Secretary, and then Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution over the course of his career. As an astrophysicist, he researched the solar constant, research that led him to invent the solar cooker, solar boiler, solar still, and other patented solar energy inventions. Early life and education Abbot, at age eleven, with the water wheel he invented. Charles Greeley Abbot was born in Wilton, New Hampshire. His parents were farmers and he was the youngest of four children. As a youth he built and invented numerous things, such as a forge to fix tools, a water wheel to power a saw, and a bicycle. He dropped out of school when he was 13 to become a carpenter. Two years later he went back to high school. He attended Phillips Andover Academy. When a friend of his went to Boston to take the entrance exam to get into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Abbot went for the chance to visit Boston. However, upon arrival, he was uncomfortable visiting Boston alone and chose to take the exam instead. He passed and his family gathered the funds to send him to MIT for one year. He started out studying chemical engineering, but eventually moved on to physics. He graduated in 1894 with a Master of Science in physics. During his time in Boston, Abbot met Samuel P. Langley on the MIT campus when Langley visited seeking an assistant. In 1895, he would start working as an aid at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Charles Greeley Abbot, between 1913 and 1917 While at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), Abbot would work under Samuel P. Langley. Langley would go on to change his focus from solar radiation to aeronautics, with Abbot taking over solar radiation research. Abbot would participate in many expeditions. In 1900 he, along with Langley, would travel to Wadesboro, North Carolina to observe a solar eclipse, followed by another eclipse expedition to Sumatra in 1901. During his expedition experiences he would also travel to Algeria, Egypt, South Africa, Australia, and other countries, often in partnership with the National Geographic Society. Abbot would become acting director of SAO in 1906 and in 1907, Abbot became the Director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, following the death of Samuel P. Langley. While Langley was still Director, he had visited Mount Whitney, and decided it would be a great place for an observatory. Abbot secured funding for the observatory and it was built in 1909. As Director, a position he would hold until his retirement, Abbot would open the Radiation Biology Laboratory in 1929, to study radiation effects on plants, and other organisms. This helped to develop the first wave of biophysics researchers in the United States. Life and work as Smithsonian Secretary Abbot with a container full of printouts of solar observations, 1968 Abbot would become the Assistant Secretary at the Smithsonian Institution in 1918, upon the death of Frederick W. True. In his role as Assistant Secretary he would oversee the Smithsonian Institution Libraries, the International Exchange Service, and the SAO. He also co-created the Smithsonian Scientific Series books, which helped raise funds for the Smithsonian. Ten years later, on January 10, 1928, he became the fifth Secretary of the Smithsonian after the death of Charles Doolittle Walcott. Abbot would also maintain his position as Director of the Astrophysical Observatory. In 1927, Walcott had finalized the Smithsonian's strategic plan, which Abbot took on responsibility for upon his election as Secretary. The Smithsonian began a capital campaign in 1929, coinciding with the start of the Great Depression. During this tenure, Abbot oversaw the Smithsonian's participation in Works Progress Administration projects, including the Federal Art Project. Projects included new buildings and artwork at the National Zoo, and the start of the Smithsonian's first media project, a radio show called The World is Yours. The program would be ceased in 1942 due to World War II. In the 1930s an expansion was approved for the National Museum of Natural History building, which would not begin until the 1960s. The Institute for Social Anthropology was also transferred to the Smithsonian during this time. While Secretary, Abbot would fail to acquire the National Gallery of Art for the Smithsonian. Abbot's role in the United States National Museum was also minimal, and was under the primary care of Assistant Secretary Alexander Wetmore. He was the first Smithsonian Secretary to retire, ending his tenure on July 1, 1944. Following retirement, he was awarded Secretary Emeritus status and proceeded to continue his research work. The first Smithsonian holiday party would be held during his tenure. At the party, Abbot sang and played the cello for the partygoers. While in Washington, he was a deacon at the First Congregational Church. He also played tennis frequently at the former tennis courts at the Smithsonian Castle. Later life and legacy On May 31, 1955, the Smithsonian held a birthday party for Abbot, marking his 83rd birthday and his 60th year of association with the Smithsonian. The event was held at the Smithsonian Castle and a bronze bust of Abbot, by Alicia Neatherly, was presented, and donated to the National Gallery of Art. Charles Greeley Abbot died, at age 101 in Maryland, on December 17, 1973. The American Solar Energy Society has an award named in Abbot's honor, which is awarded for contributions to solar energy research. The Abbot crater on the Moon has been named after him. Research work Abbot's solar cooker at Mount Wilson Observatory. Abbot began his astrophysics research focusing on solar radiation before proceeding to chart cyclic patterns found in solar variations. With this research he hoped to track solar constant in order to make weather pattern predictions. He believed that the sun was a variable star which effected the weather on Earth, which was criticized by many contemporaries. In 1953, he discovered a connection between solar variations and planetary climate. This discovery allowed general climate patterns to be predicted 50 years in advance. He did field work at the Smithsonian Institution Shelter, which was built during his tenure as director at SAO, Lick Observatory, and Mount Wilson Observatory. At Lick, he worked with W.W. Campbell. To fight critics, Abbot would utilize balloons with pyrheliometers installed on them for measurements. He was the first scientist in America to do so, with the balloons reaching upwards of 25 kilometers. One balloon returned data that allowed Abbot to determine the solar constant at the highest point of the Earth's atmosphere. Later in his research career, he turned his focus on solar energy use. An instrumentalist, he invented the solar cooker, which was first built at Mount Wilson Observatory, the solar boiler, and held fifteen other patents related to solar energy. For his research and contributions to the sciences, Abbot was awarded a Henry Draper Medal in 1910 and a Rumford Medal in 1916.

The neurons in one nucleus usually have roughly similar connections and functions. Nuclei are connected to other nuclei by tracts, the bundles (fascicles) of axons (nerve fibers) extending from the cell bodies. A nucleus is one of the two most common forms of nerve cell organization, the other being layered structures such as the cerebral cortex or cerebellar cortex. In anatomical sections, a nucleus shows up as a region of gray matter, often bordered by white matter. The vertebrate brain contains hundreds of distinguishable nuclei, varying widely in shape and size. A nucleus may itself have a complex internal structure, with multiple types of neurons arranged in clumps (subnuclei) or layers. The term \\"nucleus\\" is in some cases used rather loosely, to mean simply an identifiably distinct group of neurons, even if they are spread over an extended area. The reticular nucleus of the thalamus, for example, is a thin layer of inhibitory neurons that surrounds the thalamus. Some of the major anatomical components of the brain are organized as clusters of interconnected nuclei. Notable among these are the thalamus and hypothalamus, each of which contains several dozen distinguishable substructures. The medulla and pons also contain numerous small nuclei with a wide variety of sensory, motor, and regulatory functions. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), a cluster of cell bodies of neurons (homologous to a CNS nucleus) is called a ganglion. The fascicles of nerve fibers in the PNS (homologous to CNS tracts) are called nerves.

The Congress had already authorized the invasion of Canada more than a week earlier, but the petition affirmed American loyalty to Great Britain and beseeched King George III to prevent further conflict. It was followed by the July 6 Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, however, which made its success unlikely in London. In August 1775, the colonies were formally declared to be in rebellion by the Proclamation of Rebellion, and the petition was rejected by the British government; King George had refused to read it before declaring the colonists traitors. Drafting The Second Continental Congress convened in May 1775, and most delegates followed John Dickinson in his quest to reconcile with King George. However, a rather small group of delegates led by John Adams believed that war was inevitable, and they decided that the wisest course of action was to remain quiet and wait for the opportune time to rally the people. This allowed Dickinson and his followers to pursue their own course for reconciliation. Dickinson was the primary author of the petition, though Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, John Rutledge, and Thomas Johnson also served on the drafting committee. Dickinson claimed that the colonies did not want independence but wanted more equitable trade and tax regulations. He asked that the King establish a lasting settlement between the Mother Country and the colonies \\"upon so firm a basis as to perpetuate its blessings, uninterrupted by any future dissensions, to succeeding generations in both countries\\", beginning with the repeal of the Intolerable Acts. The introductory paragraph of the letter named twelve of the thirteen colonies, all except Georgia. The letter was approved on July 5 and signed by John Hancock, President of the Second Congress, and by representatives of the named twelve colonies. It was sent to London on July 8, 1775, in the care of Richard Penn and Arthur Lee. Dickinson hoped that news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord combined with the \\"humble petition\\" would persuade the King to respond with a counter-proposal or open negotiations. Reception and rejection Adams wrote to a friend that the petition served no purpose, that war was inevitable, and that the colonies should have already raised a navy and taken British officials prisoner. The letter was intercepted by British officials and news of its contents reached Great Britain at about the same time as the petition itself. British advocates of a military response used Adams' letter to claim that the petition itself was insincere. Penn and Lee provided a copy of the petition to colonial secretary Lord Dartmouth on August 21, followed with the original on September 1. They reported back on September 2: \\"we were told that as his Majesty did not receive it on the throne, no answer would be given.\\" The King had already issued the Proclamation of Rebellion on August 23 in response to news of the Battle of Bunker Hill, declaring the American colonies to be in a state of rebellion and ordering \\"all Our officers‚Ä¶ and all Our obedient and loyal subjects, to use their utmost endeavours to withstand and suppress such rebellion\\". The hostilities which Adams had foreseen undercut the petition, and the King had answered it before it even reached him. Consequences The King's refusal to consider the petition gave Adams and others the opportunity to push for independence, viewing the King as intransigent and uninterested in addressing the colonists' grievances. It polarized the issue in the minds of many colonists, who realized that the choice from that point forward was between complete independence and complete submission to British rule, a realization crystallized a few months later in Thomas Paine's widely read pamphlet Common Sense.

The Convention was the result of prolonged efforts by the international community to establish a new instrument that would supplement the 1925 Geneva Protocol. The Geneva Protocol prohibits use but not possession or development of chemical and biological weapons. A draft of the BWC, submitted by the British was opened for signature on 10 April 1972 and entered into force 26 March 1975 when twenty-two governments had deposited their instruments of ratification. It commits the 183 states which are party to it as of August 2019 to prohibit the development, production, and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons. However, the absence of any formal verification regime to monitor compliance has limited the effectiveness of the Convention. An additional five states have signed the BWC but have yet to ratify the treaty. The scope of the BWC's prohibition is defined in Article 1 (the so- called general purpose criterion). This includes all microbial and other biological agents or toxins and their means of delivery (with exceptions for medical and defensive purposes in small quantities). Subsequent Review Conferences have reaffirmed that the general purpose criterion encompasses all future scientific and technological developments relevant to the Convention. It is not the objects themselves (biological agents or toxins), but rather certain purposes for which they may be employed which are prohibited; similar to Art.II, 1 in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Permitted purposes under the BWC are defined as prophylactic, protective and other peaceful purposes. The objects may not be retained in quantities that have no justification or which are inconsistent with the permitted purposes. As stated in Article 1 of the BWC: \\"Each State Party to this Convention undertakes never in any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain: * (1) Microbial or other biological agents, or toxins whatever their origin or method of production, of types and in quantities that have no justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes; * (2) Weapons, equipment or means of delivery designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict.\\" The United States Congress passed the Bioweapons Anti-Terrorism Act in 1989 to implement the Convention. The law applies the Convention's convent to countries and private citizens, and criminalizes violations of the Convention. Summary * Article I: Never under any circumstances to acquire or retain biological weapons. * Article II: To destroy or divert to peaceful purposes biological weapons and associated resources prior to joining. * Article III: Not to transfer, or in any way assist, encourage or induce anyone else to acquire or retain biological weapons. * Article IV: To take any national measures necessary to implement the provisions of the BWC domestically. * Article V: To consult bilaterally and multilaterally to solve any problems with the implementation of the BWC. * Article VI: To request the UN Security Council to investigate alleged breaches of the BWC and to comply with its subsequent decisions. * Article VII: To assist States which have been exposed to a danger as a result of a violation of the BWC. * Article VIII: To do all of the above in a way that encourages the peaceful uses of biological science and technology. Membership The BWC has 183 States Parties as of August 2019, with Tanzania the most recent to become a party. The Republic of China (Taiwan) had deposited an instrument of ratification before the changeover of the United Nations seat to the People's Republic of China. Several countries made reservations when ratifying the agreement declaring that it did not imply their complete satisfaction that the Treaty allows the stockpiling of biological agents and toxins for \\"prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes\\", nor should it imply recognition of other countries they do not recognise. Of the UN member states and UN observer which are not a party to the treaty, five have signed but not ratified the BWC while a further 10 have neither signed nor ratified the agreement. Verification and compliance issues A long process of negotiation to add a verification mechanism began in the 1990s. Previously, at the second Review Conference of State Parties in 1986, member states agreed to strengthen the treaty by reporting annually on Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) to the United Nations. Currently, less than half of the treaty signatories actually submit these voluntary annual reports. The following Review Conference in 1991 established a group of government experts (known as VEREX). Negotiations towards an internationally binding verification protocol to the BWC took place between 1995 and 2001 in a forum known as the Ad Hoc Group. On 25 July 2001, the Bush administration, after conducting a review of policy on biological weapons, decided that the proposed protocol did not suit the national interests of the United States. Payment issues Implementation of the BWC, and the review conferences to support further progress, have recently been hobbled by financial considerations. In 2018, the Meeting of State parties was cut short due to a funding shortfall, , and the continued nonpayment or underpayment by states is a continuing issue and topic of conversation in 2019. As of July 31, 2019, the total outstanding debt is $251,382.46, spread among 95 countries with outstanding debts. Some of these debts are minimal, in part due to the sliding scale of dues, with 34 countries' outstanding debts under $100, and a further 43 under $1,000. Brazil had the highest outstanding debt, owing $110,948.23, while (the Bolivarian Republic of) Venezuela had the second highest debt, $51,272.91. Financial shortfalls almost caused a cancellation of state-party meetings in December 2019. However, BWC members agreed at this conference, held in Geneva December 4‚Äì7, 2018, to establish a working capital fund, financed by voluntary contributions, to provide short-term financing ‚Äì including paying the convention's small secretariat -- pending receipt of contributions from member countries. Review conferences States Parties have formally reviewed the operation of the BWC at quinquennial review conferences held in 1980, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001/02, 2006, 2011, and 2016. During these review conferences, States Parties have reaffirmed that the scope of the Convention extends to new scientific and technological developments, and have also instituted confidence-building data-exchanges in order to enhance transparency and strengthen the BWC. Review conferences, other than the Fifth, adopted additional understandings or agreements that have interpreted, defined or elaborated the meaning or scope of a BWC provision, or that have provided instructions, guidelines or recommendations on how a provision should be implemented. These additional understandings are contained in the Final Declarations of the Review Conferences. There has been an increase in the percentage of delegates from States Parties who have been women since the first review conference, with just 7 percent in 1980 to 26 percent in 2011. =Fifth Review Conference= The BWC lacks an enforcement mechanism against parties who might seek to develop, produce or stockpile agents of germ warfare. For many years, diplomats negotiated in Geneva to arrive at legally binding mechanisms to enforce compliance. The Fifth Review Conference took place in November/December 2001, at a time of heightened concern about international terrorism in the wake of the September 11 attacks and the 2001 anthrax attacks. However, the United States government decided to pull out of discussions on strengthening the convention by adding an effective legally binding enforcement mechanism. This in effect scuttled talks on the issue, stunning negotiators from other countries. Many analysts, including Matthew Meselson, a biologist at Harvard University who helped draft a treaty banning biological weapons, and biological and chemical weapons specialist Amy Smithson of the Washington-based Stimson Center, criticized the U.S. decision as undermining international efforts against non-proliferation and as contradicting U.S. government rhetoric regarding the alleged biological weapons threat posed by Iraq and other U.S. foes.Washington Post, 19 September 2002, archived at: Peter Slevin, ‚ÄúU.S. Drops Bid to Strengthen Germ Warfare Accord,‚Äù The Conference was suspended for one year. When it was reconvened in November 2002, the Fifth Review Conference decided to hold annual meetings of States Parties over the inter-sessional period leading up to the Review Conference in 2006 to discuss and promote common understanding and effective action on a range of other topics.BWC document BWC/CONF.V/17 (2001 and 2002), available via the BWC Implementation Support Unit website or the UN Official Documents System. Agreement was reached on convening annual one-week-long \\"Meeting of States Parties\\" that would be preceded earlier in the year by a two-week \\"Meeting of Experts\\" who would discuss a specific list of topics: * 2003: National mechanisms to establish and maintain the security and oversight of pathogenic micro-organisms and toxins. * 2004: Enhancing international capabilities for responding to, investigating and mitigating the effects of cases of alleged use of biological or toxin weapons or suspicious outbreaks of disease. * 2004: Strengthening and broadening the capabilities for international institutions to detect and respond to the outbreak of infectious diseases (including diseases affecting plants and animals). * 2005: Codes of conduct for scientists. =Sixth Review Conference= In the final document of the Sixth Review Conference, held in 2006, it simply \\"notes\\" that the meetings \\"functioned as an important forum for exchange of national experiences and in depth deliberations among States Parties\\" and that they \\"engendered greater common understanding on steps to be taken to further strengthen the implementation of the Convention\\". The Conference \\"endorses the consensus outcome documents\\" from the Meeting of States Parties. The Sixth Review Conference agreed to establish a second Inter-Sessional Process. The topics agreed upon were: i. Ways and means to enhance national implementation, including enforcement of national legislation, strengthening of national institutions and coordination among national law enforcement institutions. ii. Regional and sub regional cooperation on BWC implementation. iii. National, regional and international measures to improve biosafety and biosecurity, including laboratory safety and security of pathogens and toxins. iv. Oversight, education, awareness raising, and adoption and/or development of codes of conduct with the aim to prevent misuse in the context of advances in bio science and bio technology research with the potential of use for purposes prohibited by the Convention. v. With a view to enhancing international cooperation, assistance and exchange in biological sciences and technology for peaceful purposes, promoting capacity building in the fields of disease surveillance, detection, diagnosis, and containment of infectious diseases: (1) for States Parties in need of assistance, identifying requirements and requests for capacity enhancement, and (2) from States Parties in a position to do so, and international organizations, opportunities for providing assistance related to these fields. vi. Provision of assistance and coordination with relevant organizations upon request by any State Party in the case of alleged use of biological or toxin weapons, including improving national capabilities for disease surveillance, detection and diagnosis and public health systems. Topics i and ii were dealt with in 2007, iii and iv in 2008, v in 2009, and vi in 2010. For the second Inter-Sessional Process, the Meetings of Experts for each year was reduced to one week. =Seventh Review Conference= The Seventh Review Conference was held in Geneva from 5 to 22 December 2011. The Final Declaration document affirmed that \\"under all circumstances the use of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons is effectively prohibited by the Convention\\" and \\"the determination of States parties to condemn any use of biological agents or toxins other than for peaceful purposes, by anyone at any time.\\" =Eighth Review Conference= The Eighth BWC Review Conference, held in Geneva in November 2016, had minimal achievements, according to Arms Control Today, and passed a final document that echoed the final document of the Seventh Review Conference. While Western countries wanted to pursue ways to address rapidly advancing changes in technology, most of the participating countries, including Iran and some states of the Non-Aligned Movement, viewed the results as a missed opportunity to advance measures to strengthen the legally binding accord that bans development of biological agents, and wanted negotiations to restart effort to pass the BWC Protocol. =Ninth Review Conference= The Ninth BWC Review Conference will be held in Geneva in late 2021. On December 9, 2019, Sri Lanka was elected chairman of the 2020 Meeting of State Parties, an intersessional which will meet in December 2020 and discuss the agenda for the Ninth Review Conference.

Progress in Electromagnetics Research M. 66: 87‚Äì98  url =http://www.jpier.org/PIERM/pierm66/09.18011016.pdf. is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions. PSO is originally attributed to Kennedy, Eberhart and Shi and was first intended for simulating social behaviour, as a stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a bird flock or fish school. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The book by Kennedy and Eberhart describes many philosophical aspects of PSO and swarm intelligence. An extensive survey of PSO applications is made by Poli. Recently, a comprehensive review on theoretical and experimental works on PSO has been published by Bonyadi and Michalewicz. PSO is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. However, metaheuristics such as PSO do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found. Also, PSO does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means PSO does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi-newton methods.  Algorithm  A basic variant of the PSO algorithm works by having a population (called a swarm) of candidate solutions (called particles). These particles are moved around in the search-space according to a few simple formulae. The movements of the particles are guided by their own best known position in the search-space as well as the entire swarm's best known position. When improved positions are being discovered these will then come to guide the movements of the swarm. The process is repeated and by doing so it is hoped, but not guaranteed, that a satisfactory solution will eventually be discovered. Formally, let f: ‚Ñùn ‚Üí ‚Ñù be the cost function which must be minimized. The function takes a candidate solution as an argument in the form of a vector of real numbers and produces a real number as output which indicates the objective function value of the given candidate solution. The gradient of f is not known. The goal is to find a solution a for which f(a) ‚â§ f(b) for all b in the search-space, which would mean a is the global minimum. Let S be the number of particles in the swarm, each having a position xi ‚àà ‚Ñùn in the search-space and a velocity vi ‚àà ‚Ñùn. Let pi be the best known position of particle i and let g be the best known position of the entire swarm. A basic PSO algorithm is then: for each particle i = 1, ..., S do Initialize the particle's position with a uniformly distributed random vector: xi ~ U(blo, bup) Initialize the particle's best known position to its initial position: pi ‚Üê xi if f(pi) < f(g) then update the swarm's best known position: g ‚Üê pi Initialize the particle's velocity: vi ~ U(-bup-blo, bup-blo) while a termination criterion is not met do: for each particle i = 1, ..., S do for each dimension d = 1, ..., n do Pick random numbers: rp, rg ~ U(0,1) Update the particle's velocity: vi,d ‚Üê œâ vi,d \\\\+ œÜp rp (pi,d-xi,d) + œÜg rg (gd-xi,d) Update the particle's position: xi ‚Üê xi \\\\+ lr vi if f(xi) < f(pi) then Update the particle's best known position: pi ‚Üê xi if f(pi) < f(g) then Update the swarm's best known position: g ‚Üê pi The values blo and bup represent the lower and upper boundaries of the search-space respectively. The termination criterion can be the number of iterations performed, or a solution where the adequate objective function value is found. The parameters œâ, œÜp, and œÜg are selected by the practitioner and control the behaviour and efficacy of the PSO method (below). lr represents the learning rate (0 ‚â§ lr ‚â§ 1.0), which is the proportion at which the velocity affects the movement of the particle (where lr = 0 means the velocity will not affect the particle at all and lr = 1 means the velocity will fully affect the particle).  Parameter selection  Performance landscape showing how a simple PSO variant performs in aggregate on several benchmark problems when varying two PSO parameters. The choice of PSO parameters can have a large impact on optimization performance. Selecting PSO parameters that yield good performance has therefore been the subject of much research. The PSO parameters can also be tuned by using another overlaying optimizer, a concept known as meta-optimization, or even fine-tuned during the optimization, e.g., by means of fuzzy logic. Parameters have also been tuned for various optimization scenarios. Neighbourhoods and topologies The topology of the swarm defines the subset of particles with which each particle can exchange information. The basic version of the algorithm uses the global topology as the swarm communication structure. This topology allows all particles to communicate with all the other particles, thus the whole swarm share the same best position g from a single particle. However, this approach might lead the swarm to be trapped into a local minimum,Mendes, R. (2004). Population Topologies and Their Influence in Particle Swarm Performance (PhD thesis). Universidade do Minho. thus different topologies have been used to control the flow of information among particles. For instance, in local topologies, particles only share information with a subset of particles. This subset can be a geometrical oneSuganthan, Ponnuthurai N. \\"Particle swarm optimiser with neighbourhood operator.\\" Evolutionary Computation, 1999. CEC 99. Proceedings of the 1999 Congress on. Vol. 3. IEEE, 1999. ‚Äì for example \\"the m nearest particles\\" ‚Äì or, more often, a social one, i.e. a set of particles that is not depending on any distance. In such cases, the PSO variant is said to be local best (vs global best for the basic PSO). A commonly used swarm topology is the ring, in which each particle has just two neighbours, but there are many others. The topology is not necessarily static. In fact, since the topology is related to the diversity of communication of the particles, some efforts have been done to create adaptive topologies (SPSO,SPSO Particle Swarm Central APSO, Almasi, O.

A Complementary Cyber Swarm Algorithm. International Journal of Swarm Intelligence Research (IJSIR), 2(2), 22-41 and C-PSO).  Inner workings  There are several schools of thought as to why and how the PSO algorithm can perform optimization. A common belief amongst researchers is that the swarm behaviour varies between exploratory behaviour, that is, searching a broader region of the search-space, and exploitative behaviour, that is, a locally oriented search so as to get closer to a (possibly local) optimum. This school of thought has been prevalent since the inception of PSO. This school of thought contends that the PSO algorithm and its parameters must be chosen so as to properly balance between exploration and exploitation to avoid premature convergence to a local optimum yet still ensure a good rate of convergence to the optimum. This belief is the precursor of many PSO variants, see below. Another school of thought is that the behaviour of a PSO swarm is not well understood in terms of how it affects actual optimization performance, especially for higher-dimensional search-spaces and optimization problems that may be discontinuous, noisy, and time-varying. This school of thought merely tries to find PSO algorithms and parameters that cause good performance regardless of how the swarm behaviour can be interpreted in relation to e.g. exploration and exploitation. Such studies have led to the simplification of the PSO algorithm, see below. = Convergence = In relation to PSO the word convergence typically refers to two different definitions: * Convergence of the sequence of solutions (aka, stability analysis, converging) in which all particles have converged to a point in the search-space, which may or may not be the optimum, * Convergence to a local optimum where all personal bests p or, alternatively, the swarm's best known position g, approaches a local optimum of the problem, regardless of how the swarm behaves. Convergence of the sequence of solutions has been investigated for PSO. These analyses have resulted in guidelines for selecting PSO parameters that are believed to cause convergence to a point and prevent divergence of the swarm's particles (particles do not move unboundedly and will converge to somewhere). However, the analyses were criticized by Pedersen for being oversimplified as they assume the swarm has only one particle, that it does not use stochastic variables and that the points of attraction, that is, the particle's best known position p and the swarm's best known position g, remain constant throughout the optimization process. However, it was shown that these simplifications do not affect the boundaries found by these studies for parameter where the swarm is convergent. Considerable effort has been made in recent years to weaken the modelling assumption utilized during the stability analysis of PSO , with the most recent generalized result applying to numerous PSO variants and utilized what was shown to be the minimal necessary modeling assumptions . Convergence to a local optimum has been analyzed for PSO in and. It has been proven that PSO needs some modification to guarantee finding a local optimum. This means that determining convergence capabilities of different PSO algorithms and parameters still depends on empirical results. One attempt at addressing this issue is the development of an \\"orthogonal learning\\" strategy for an improved use of the information already existing in the relationship between p and g, so as to form a leading converging exemplar and to be effective with any PSO topology. The aims are to improve the performance of PSO overall, including faster global convergence, higher solution quality, and stronger robustness. However, such studies do not provide theoretical evidence to actually prove their claims. = Adaptive mechanisms = Without the need for a trade-off between convergence ('exploitation') and divergence ('exploration'), an adaptive mechanism can be introduced. Adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) features better search efficiency than standard PSO. APSO can perform global search over the entire search space with a higher convergence speed. It enables automatic control of the inertia weight, acceleration coefficients, and other algorithmic parameters at the run time, thereby improving the search effectiveness and efficiency at the same time. Also, APSO can act on the globally best particle to jump out of the likely local optima. However, APSO will introduce new algorithm parameters, it does not introduce additional design or implementation complexity nonetheless.  Variants  Numerous variants of even a basic PSO algorithm are possible. For example, there are different ways to initialize the particles and velocities (e.g. start with zero velocities instead), how to dampen the velocity, only update pi and g after the entire swarm has been updated, etc. Some of these choices and their possible performance impact have been discussed in the literature. A series of standard implementations have been created by leading researchers, \\"intended for use both as a baseline for performance testing of improvements to the technique, as well as to represent PSO to the wider optimization community. Having a well-known, strictly-defined standard algorithm provides a valuable point of comparison which can be used throughout the field of research to better test new advances.\\" The latest is Standard PSO 2011 (SPSO-2011). = Hybridization = New and more sophisticated PSO variants are also continually being introduced in an attempt to improve optimization performance. There are certain trends in that research; one is to make a hybrid optimization method using PSO combined with other optimizers, e.g., combined PSO with biogeography-based optimization, and the incorporation of an effective learning method. = Alleviate premature convergence= Another research trend is to try and alleviate premature convergence (that is, optimization stagnation), e.g. by reversing or perturbing the movement of the PSO particles, another approach to deal with premature convergence is the use of multiple swarms (multi-swarm optimization). The multi-swarm approach can also be used to implement multi-objective optimization. Finally, there are developments in adapting the behavioural parameters of PSO during optimization. = Simplifications = Another school of thought is that PSO should be simplified as much as possible without impairing its performance; a general concept often referred to as Occam's razor. Simplifying PSO was originally suggested by Kennedy and has been studied more extensively, where it appeared that optimization performance was improved, and the parameters were easier to tune and they performed more consistently across different optimization problems. Another argument in favour of simplifying PSO is that metaheuristics can only have their efficacy demonstrated empirically by doing computational experiments on a finite number of optimization problems. This means a metaheuristic such as PSO cannot be proven correct and this increases the risk of making errors in its description and implementation. A good example of this presented a promising variant of a genetic algorithm (another popular metaheuristic) but it was later found to be defective as it was strongly biased in its optimization search towards similar values for different dimensions in the search space, which happened to be the optimum of the benchmark problems considered. This bias was because of a programming error, and has now been fixed. Initialization of velocities may require extra inputs. The Bare Bones PSO variant has been proposed in 2003 by James Kennedy, and does not need to use velocity at all. Another simpler variant is the accelerated particle swarm optimization (APSO),X. S. Yang, S. Deb and S. Fong, Accelerated particle swarm optimization and support vector machine for business optimization and applications, NDT 2011, Springer CCIS 136, pp. 53-66 (2011). which also does not need to use velocity and can speed up the convergence in many applications. A simple demo code of APSO is available. =Multi-objective optimization= PSO has also been applied to multi- objective problems, in which the objective function comparison takes pareto dominance into account when moving the PSO particles and non-dominated solutions are stored so as to approximate the pareto front. =Binary, discrete, and combinatorial= As the PSO equations given above work on real numbers, a commonly used method to solve discrete problems is to map the discrete search space to a continuous domain, to apply a classical PSO, and then to demap the result. Such a mapping can be very simple (for example by just using rounded values) or more sophisticated.Roy, R., Dehuri, S., & Cho, S. B. (2012). A Novel Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Multi- Objective Combinatorial Optimization Problem. 'International Journal of Applied Metaheuristic Computing (IJAMC)', 2(4), 41-57 However, it can be noted that the equations of movement make use of operators that perform four actions: *computing the difference of two positions. The result is a velocity (more precisely a displacement) *multiplying a velocity by a numerical coefficient *adding two velocities *applying a velocity to a position Usually a position and a velocity are represented by n real numbers, and these operators are simply -, *, +, and again +. But all these mathematical objects can be defined in a completely different way, in order to cope with binary problems (or more generally discrete ones), or even combinatorial ones.Kennedy, J. & Eberhart, R.

Established in Cooperstown, New York, on August 10, 1971 by sportswriter Bob Davids, it is based in Phoenix, Arizona. Its membership as of June 1, 2019, is 5,367.It's impossible for me to get the online link for this -- I can download it as a PDF and find the membership page but I am totally unable to use the SABR membership website to view the information online. Membership While the acronym \\"SABR\\" may have lent its root to the word sabermetrics (for the use of sophisticated mathematical tools to analyze baseball), the Society is about much more than statistics. Well known figures in the baseball world such as Bob Costas, Keith Olbermann, Craig R. Wright, and Rollie Hemond are members, along with highly regarded \\"sabermetricians\\" such as Bill James and Rob Neyer. Among Major League players Jeff Bajenaru was believed to have been (until 2006) the only active player with a SABR membership; Elden Auker, Larry Dierker, and Andy Seminick also have been involved. Some prominent SABR members include: * Bob Davids, founder (deceased) * Bob McConnell, Home Run Log (deceased) * Bill Carle, Biographical Committee * Don Daglow, computer game designer, writer * Bill James, analyst, writer * Larry Lester, Negro Leagues Committee * David Neft, writer, historian, encyclopedist * David Nemec, prolific writer * Rob Neyer, analyst, journalist * Pete Palmer, analyst, encyclopedist * Dave Smith, analyst, Retrosheet founder * Lyle Spatz, Records Committee * John Thorn, historian, encyclopedist * Robert L. Tiemann, historian * Mickey Vernon, two-time American League batting champion (deceased) * David W. Vincent, Home Run Log (deceased) * Larry Dierker, former Major League All-Star pitcher Activities Only a minority of members pursue \\"number crunching\\" research. Rather, the SABR community is organized both by interest and geography: *Research Committees study a particular issue *Regional Chapters link members by proximity. The latter are frequently named after baseball personalities relevant to their region. * SABR also has an active Biography Project, with members authoring well-researched and engaging biographies of a growing list of former big league ballplayers and other notable contributors to the game. SABR members keep in touch through online directories and electronic mailing lists set up through the SABR headquarters. The headquarters also maintains a number of research tools on its website, including a lending library, home run and triple play logs, and course syllabi related to the game. SABR holds annual conventions in a different city each year. The conference generally includes panel discussions, research presentations, city-specific tourism, a ballgame, and an awards banquet. The 2007 convention in St. Louis, Missouri set the attendance record with 726 registered attendees out of approximately 7,000 SABR members. The organization also hosts an annual baseball analytics conference in Phoenix and a Negro Leagues conference, which is held in a different location each year.  Publications  The Baseball Research Journal (BRJ) is SABR's flagship publication since 1972 for members to publish and share their research with like-minded students of baseball. The National Pastime is an annual, published from 1982 to 2008 as The National Pastime: A Review of Baseball History, when it was intended as a more literary outlet than the stats oriented BRJ; since 2009 it is a convention-focused journal, with articles about the geographic region where the convention is taking place that year. Other Society publications are an increasing variety of books (since 1976) and ebooks (since 2011); 8-10 new e-books published annually are all free to members. Awards SABR annual awards include: * Bob Davids Award: for exceptional SABR members who have made contributions to SABR and baseball that reflect ingenuity, integrity, and self-sacrifice. It is SABR's highest honor, and was established in 1985. * Henry Chadwick Award: for baseball researchers‚Äîhistorians, statisticians, annalists, and archivists.Established in November 2009, the Henry Chadwick Award was first presented in 2010. * SeymourHarold Seymour and his wife Dorothy Seymour Mills together wrote a three-volume history: Baseball: The Early Years (1960), Baseball: The Golden Age (1971), and Baseball: The People's Game (1991). Medal: best book of baseball history or biography published during the preceding calendar year.The Seymour Medal was first awarded in 1996, at the SABR national convention. SABR held the first Seymour Medal Conference in 1999, at Cleveland State University, in conjunction with the presentation of the medal. See also: Baseball awards#Baseball book of the year. * McFarland-SABR Baseball Research Award: for authors of the best articles on baseball history or biography completed during the preceding calendar year (published or unpublished).The McFarland award was \\"previously named The Macmillan-SABR Baseball Research Award (1987‚Äì1999)\\", according to * Sporting News-SABR Baseball Research Award: for projects which do not fit the criteria for The Seymour Medal or the McFarland- SABR Award. * Jerry Malloy Book Prize: best book-length nonfiction manuscript submitted by a member of SABR. * Doug Pappas Research Award: best oral research presentation at the Annual Convention. * Lee Allen Award: for the best baseball research project at the annual National History Day competition. * Jack Kavanagh Memorial Youth Baseball Research Award: research paper by a researcher in grades 6‚Äì8 (middle school category), grades 9‚Äì12 (high school category), or undergraduates 22 and under (College Category). In 2013, SABR began collaborating with Rawlings on the Gold Glove Award. Rawlings changed the voting process to incorporate SABR Defensive Index, a sabermetric component provided by SABR, which accounts for approximately 25 percent of the vote for the defensive award.

Marianne () has been the national personification of the French Republic since the French Revolution, as a personification of liberty, equality, fraternity and reason, and a portrayal of the Goddess of Liberty. Marianne is displayed in many places in France and holds a place of honour in town halls and law courts. She is depicted in the Triumph of the Republic, a bronze sculpture overlooking the Place de la Nation in Paris, and is represented with another Parisian statue in the Place de la R√©publique. Her profile stands out on the official government logo of the country, is engraved on French euro coins, and appears on French postage stamps.Marianne on French stamps It was also featured on the former franc currency. Marianne is one of the most prominent symbols of the French Republic, and is officially used on most government documents. Marianne is a significant republican symbol; her French monarchist equivalent is often Joan of Arc. As a national icon Marianne represents opposition to monarchy and the championship of freedom and democracy against all forms of oppression. Other national symbols of France include the tricolor flag, the national motto Libert√©, √âgalit√©, Fraternit√©, the national anthem \\"La Marseillaise\\", the coat of arms, and the official Great Seal of France. Marianne also wore a Cockade and a red cap that symbolised Liberty. History Liberty Leading the People by Eug√®ne Delacroix (1830), celebrates the July Revolution (Louvre Museum). Since classical times it was common to represent ideas and abstract entities by gods, goddesses and allegorical personifications. During the French Revolution of 1789, many allegorical personifications of 'Liberty' and 'Reason' appeared. These two figures finally merged into one: a female figure, shown either sitting or standing, and accompanied by various attributes, including the cockade of France and the Phrygian cap. This woman typically symbolised Liberty, Reason, the Nation, the Homeland, and the civic virtues of the Republic. (Compare the Statue of Liberty, created as Liberty Enlightening the World by French artist Fr√©d√©ric Auguste Bartholdi, with a copy in both Paris and Saint-√âtienne.) In September 1792, the National Convention decided by decree that the new seal of the state would represent a standing woman holding a spear with a Phrygian cap held aloft on top of it. Historian Maurice Agulhon, who in several well-known works set out on a detailed investigation to discover the origins of Marianne, suggests that it is the traditions and mentality of the French that led to the use of a woman to represent the Republic. A feminine allegory was also a manner to symbolise the breaking with the old monarchy headed by kings, and promote modern republican ideology. Even before the French Revolution, the Kingdom of France was embodied in masculine figures, as depicted in certain ceilings of Palace of Versailles. Furthermore, France and the Republic themselves are, in French, feminine nouns (la France, la R√©publique), as are the French nouns for liberty (Libert√©) and reason (Raison). The use of this emblem was initially unofficial and very diverse. A female allegory of Liberty and of the Republic makes an appearance in Eug√®ne Delacroix's painting Liberty Leading the People, painted in July 1830 in honour of the Three Glorious Days (or July Revolution of 1830). =The First Republic= Bust of Marianne, displayed in the corridors of the Luxembourg Palace, seat of the French Senate. (anonymous artist) Although the image of Marianne did not garner significant attention until 1792, the origins of this \\"goddess of Liberty\\" date back to 1775, when Jean-Michel Moreau painted her as a young woman dressed in Roman style clothing with a Phrygian cap atop a pike held in one handHunt 1984, p. 62. that years later would become a national symbol across France. Marianne made her first major appearance in the French spotlight on a medal in July 1789, celebrating the storming of the Bastille and other early events of the Revolution. From this time until September 1792, the image of Marianne was overshadowed by other figures such as Mercury and Minerva. It was not until September 1792 when the new Republic sought a new image to represent the State that her popularity began to expand. Marianne, the female allegory of Liberty, was chosen to represent the new regime of the French Republic, while remaining to symbolise liberty at the same time.Agulhon 1981, p. 18. The imagery of Marianne chosen as the seal of the First French Republic depicted her standing, young and determined.Hunt 1984, p. 93. It was symbolic of the First Republic itself, a newly created state that had much to prove. Marianne is clad in a classical gown. In her right hand, she wields the pike of revolution with the Phrygian cap resting on it, which represents the liberation of France. Marianne is shown leaning on a fasces, a symbol of authority. Although she is standing and holding a pike, this depiction of Marianne is \\"not exactly aggressive\\", representing the ideology of the moderate-liberal Girondins in the National Convention as they tried to move away from the \\"frantic violence of the revolutionary days\\". Although the initial figure of Marianne from 1792 stood in a relatively conservative pose, the revolutionaries were quick to abandon that figure when it no longer suited them. By 1793, the conservative figure of Marianne had been replaced by a more violent image; that of a woman, bare-breasted and fierce of visage, often leading men into battle. The reason behind this switch stems from the shifting priorities of the Republic. Although the Marianne symbol was initially neutral in tone, the shift to radical action was in response to the beginning of the Terror, which called for militant revolutionary action against foreigners and counter-revolutionaries. As part of the tactics the administration employed, the more radical Marianne was intended to rouse the French people to action. Even this change, however, was seen to be insufficiently radical by the republicans. After the arrest of the Girondin deputies in October 1793, the Convention sought to \\"recast the Republic in a more radical mold\\",Hunt 1984, p. 94. eventually using the symbol of Hercules to represent the Republic. The use of increasingly radical images to symbolise the Republic was in direct parallel to the beginning of the violence that came to be known as the Reign of Terror. After the Reign of Terror, there was a need for another change in the imagery, to showcase the more civil and non-violent nature of the Directory. In the Official Vignette of the Executive Directory, 1798, Marianne made a return, still depicted wearing the Phrygian cap, but now surrounded by different symbols. In contrast to the Marianne of 1792, this Marianne \\"holds no pike or lance\\", and leans \\"languorously\\" on the tablet of the Constitution of Year III.Hunt 1984, p. 118. Instead of looking straight at the observer, she casts her gaze towards the side, thus appearing less confrontational. Similar imagery was used in the poster of the Republic's new calendar. The symbol of Marianne continued to evolve in response to the needs of the State long after the Directory was dissolved in 1799 following the coup spearheaded by Emmanuel-Joseph Siey√®s and Napoleon Bonaparte. Whereas Mercury and Minerva and other symbolic figures diminished in prominence over the course of French history, Marianne endured because of her abstraction and impersonality. The \\"malleability\\" of what she symbolised allowed French political figures to continually manipulate her image to their specific purposes at any given time. Great Seal of France (1848). The headdress of the Republic is identical to that of the Statue of Liberty. Both are prominent republican symbols. =The Second Republic= On 17 March 1848, the Ministry of the Interior of the newly founded Second Republic launched a contest to symbolise the Republic on paintings, sculptures, medals, money and seals, as no official representations of it existed. After the fall of the monarchy, the Provisional Government had declared: \\"The image of liberty should replace everywhere the images of corruption and shame, which have been broken in three days by the magnanimous French people.\\" For the first time, the allegory of Marianne condensed into itself Liberty, the Republic and the Revolution. Two \\"Mariannes\\" were authorised. One is fighting and victorious, recalling the Greek goddess Athena: she has a bare breast, the Phrygian cap and a red corsage, and has an arm lifted in a gesture of rebellion. The other is more conservative: she is rather quiet, wearing clothes in a style of Antiquity, with sun rays around her head‚Äîa transfer of the royal symbol to the Republic‚Äîand is accompanied by many symbols (wheat, a plough and the fasces of the Roman lictors). These two, rival Mariannes represent two ideas of the Republic, a bourgeois representation and a democratic and social representation ‚Äì the June Days Uprising hadn't yet occurred. Town halls voluntarily chose to have representations of Marianne, often turning her back to the church. Marianne made her first appearance on a French postage stamp in 1849.Anne-Marie Sohn. Marianne ou l'histoire de l'id√©e r√©publicaine aux XIX√® et XX√® si√®cles √† la lumi√®re de ses repr√©sentations =The Second Empire= During the Second Empire (1852‚Äì1870), this depiction became clandestine and served as a symbol of protest against the regime. The common use of the name \\"Marianne\\" for the depiction of \\"Liberty\\" started around 1848/1851, becoming generalised throughout France around 1875. =The Third Republic= Punch by John Bernard Partridge; John Bull stalks off with a defiant Marianne and turns his back on the Kaiser, who pretends not to care. \\" Freedom for France, freedom for the French \\" Marianne (1940) The usage began to be more official during the Third Republic (1870‚Äì1940). Much of the popularity of Marianne was due to the fact that she symbolized French republicanism while at the same time being neutral enough to make her into a symbol that appealed to most people. The legacy of the French Revolution tended to divide people in France as different people in France had different revolutionary heroes and villains, and unlike the United States, the French had no cult of \\"the Founding Fathers\\" whose memory was venerated by all. For this reason, the French state tended to promote abstract symbols like Marianne as an unifying national symbol instead of using personalities from history as a national symbol in the manner which the United States used George Washington and Venezuela used Simon Bolivar as national symbols in the 19th century. As a symbol of the Revolution and of the republic, Marianne was sufficiently inoffensive enough to appeal to most people without causing any controversy. Marianne's femininity made her appear less threatening as a symbol of the republic than a male figure would have been. After a turbulent first decade in the 1870s, by the 1880s the republic was accepted by most people in France and as such, the French state did not need history to justify itself, using Marianne as the unifying symbol of the republic. The only historical event that was regularly honored in France was Bastille Day, as the storming of the Bastille in 1789 was the revolutionary occurrence that appealed to most of the French, and the rest of the events of the revolution were not officially honored in order to keep the memory of the revolution as harmonious as possible. It was the strategy of the republican leaders to use symbols and the memory of history in such a way to create as a wide as national consensus as possible in favor of the republic, which was why Marianne became such a prominent symbol of the republic. By contrast, the newly unified German Reich had too many historical traditions to draw upon, reflecting the histories of the various German states, none of which could appeal to everybody, leading to a situation where the British historian Eric Hobsbawm noted: \\"Like many another liberated 'people', 'Germany' was more easily defined by what it was against than in any other way.\\" Hobsbawm argued for this reason, that unlike Marianne who was a symbol of the republic and freedom in general, her German counterpart, Deutscher Michel \\"...seems to have been essentially an anti-foreign image\\". The H√¥tel de Ville in Paris (city hall) displayed a statue of \\"Marianne\\" wearing a Phrygian cap in 1880, and was quickly followed by the other French cities. In Paris, where the Radicals had a strong presence, a contest was launched for the statue of Place de la R√©publique. It was won by the Morice brothers (with L√©opold Morice producing the sculpture and the architect Fran√ßois-Charles Morice designing the pedestal), in 1879, with an academical Marianne, with an arm lifted towards the sky and a Phrygian cap, but with her breasts covered. Aim√©-Jules Dalou lost the contest against the Morice brothers, but the City of Paris decided to build his monument on the Place de la Nation, inaugurated for the centenary of the French Revolution, in 1889, with a plaster version covered in bronze. Dalou's Marianne had the lictor's fasces, the Phrygian cap, a bare breast, and was accompanied by a Blacksmith representing Work, and allegories of Freedom, Justice, Education and Peace: all that the Republic was supposed to bring to its citizens. The final bronze monument was inaugurated in 1899, in the turmoil of the Dreyfus Affair, with Waldeck-Rousseau, a Radical, in power. The ceremony was accompanied by a huge demonstration of workers, with red flags. The government's officials, wearing black redingotes, quit the ceremony. Marianne had been reappropriated by the workers, but as the representative of the Social and Democratic Republic (la R√©publique d√©mocratique et sociale, or simply La Sociale). From the signing of the Entente Cordiale between France and Britain in April 1904, Marianne and John Bull personalised the agreement in a number of paintings and cartoons, most famously the Punch cartoon by John Bernard Partridge. In the struggles between ideological parties around the turn of the twentieth century, Marianne was often denigrated by right-wing presses as a prostitute.Alison M. Moore (ed), Sexing Political Culture in the History of France. Amherst: Cambria, 2012. . In Imperial Germany, Marianne was usually portrayed in a manner that was very vulgar, usually suggesting that she was a prostitute or at any rate widely promiscuous while at the same time being a hysterically jealous and insane woman who however always cowered in fear at the sight of a German soldier. The German state in the Imperial period promoted a very xenophobic militarism, which portrayed the Reich as forever in danger from foreigners and in need of an authoritarian government. The core of Prussian-German militarism was a cult of machismo that equated militarism with masculinity, and Marianne was used in Germany to portray France as a \\"weak\\" and \\"feminine\\" nation in contrast to \\"strong\\" and \\"masculine\\" Germany. The purpose of Marianne in German propaganda was always to promote contempt for France and with it, a warning about what Germans should not be. The American historian Michael Nolan wrote in the \\"hyper-masculine world of Wilhelmine Germany\\" with its exaltation of militarism and masculine power, the very fact that Marianne was the symbol of the republic was used to argue that French men were effeminate and weak. In this regard, it is significant in German cartoons and posters, Marianne usually faced off against a male figure representing Germany, who was either a typical German soldier or Kaiser Wilhelm II himself and Marianne only very rarely took on Germania. In French cartoons and posters, it was Marianne who took on Wilhelm II, whose bombastic pomposity lent itself well for ridicule, and she almost never took on Deutscher Michel, leading Nolan to comment that French cartoonists missed a great chance for satire since even in Germany itself, Deutscher Michel is portrayed as rather \\"dim-witted\\". On occasion, Marianne was portrayed slightly more favorably in Germany as in a cartoon from May 1914 in the magazine Kladderadatsch where Deutscher Michel is working in his garden with a seductive and voluptuous Marianne on one side and a brutish muzhik (Russian peasant) on the other; the message of the cartoon was that France should not be allied to Russia, and would be better off allied to Germany, since Deutscher Michel with his well tended garden is clearly a better potential husband than the vodka drinking muzhik whose garden is a disorderly disaster. Marianne differed from Uncle Sam, John Bull, and Deutscher Michel in that Marianne was not just a symbol of France, but of the republic as well. For those on the French right, who still hankered for the House of Bourbon like Action Fran√ßaise, Marianne was always rejected for her republican associations, and the preferred symbol of France was Joan of Arc. As Joan of Arc was devoutly Catholic, committed to serving King Charles VII, and fought for France against England, she perfectly symbolized the values of Catholicism, royalism, militarism and nationalism that were so dear for French monarchists. Joan was apparently asexual, and her chaste and virginal image stood in marked contrast to Marianne, whom Action Fran√ßaise depicted as a prostitute or as a \\"slut\\" to symbolize the \\"degeneracy\\" of the republic. The contrast between the asexual Joan vs. the unabashedly sexualized Marianne who was often depicted bare-breasted could not have been greater. Finally, because of Joan's status as one of France' best loved heroines, it was difficult for republicans to attack Joan without seeming unpatriotic. However, the royalist attempt to have Joan of Arc replace Marianne as the symbol of France failed, in large part because the most of the French people accepted the republic, and Marianne unlike Joan was the symbol of the republic. In the middle of the 19th century, Marianne was usually portrayed in France as a young woman, but by late 19th century, Marianne was more commonly presented as a middle aged, maternal woman, reflecting the fact that the republic was dominated by a centre-right coalition of older male politicians, who disliked the image of a militant young female revolutionary. After British and German newspapers began to mock the middle-aged Marianne as a symbol of supposed French decline, around 1900 the younger Marianne came back into vogue to symbolize that the republic was not in decline. In World War I, in German propaganda, Marianne was always depicted as dominating Russia, represented variously as a bear, a thuggish-looking Cossack or by the Emperor Nicholas II, with Marianne being drawn as an angry and emasculating wife. By contrast, John Bull was always depicted in German cartoons as dominating both Marianne and Russia, reflecting the German perception that Britain was the most dangerous of all the Reich's enemies. When John Bull was depicted in the company of Marianne in German cartoons, she was always the submissive one. Few Mariannes were depicted in the First World War memorials, but some living models of Marianne appeared in 1936, during the Popular Front as they had during the Second Republic (then stigmatized by the right-wing press as \\"unashamed prostitutes\\"). During World War II, Marianne represented Liberty against the Nazi invaders, and the Republic against the Vichy regime (see Paul Collin's representation). During Vichy, 120 of the 427 monuments of Marianne were melted, while the Milice took out its statues in town halls in 1943. Under Vichy, Marianne was banned and Joan of Arc became the official symbol of France. In French schools and government offices, the busts of Marianne were replaced with busts of Marshal P√©tain. As Marianne was the symbol of the republic and everything it stood for, under Vichy Marianne was demonized as the most \\"offensive\\" symbol of the republic. There was a strong misogyny to Vichy's attacks on Marianne under Vichy's ideology there were two sorts of women; the \\"virgin and the whore\\" with Joan being cast as the former and Marianne as the latter. =Fifth Republic= Marianne ¬´ La semeuse ¬ª on a five French francs coin (1970). Marianne's presence became less important after World War II, although General Charles de Gaulle made a large use of it, in particular on stamps or for the referendums. The most recent subversive and revolutionary appearance of Marianne was during May '68. The liberal and conservative president Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing replaced Marianne by La Poste on stamps, changed the rhythm of the Marseillaise and suppressed the commemoration of 8 May 1945. During the bicentenary of the Revolution, in 1989, Marianne hardly made any public appearance. The Socialist President Fran√ßois Mitterrand aimed to make the celebrations a consensual event, gathering all citizens, recalling more the Republic than the Revolution. The American opera singer Jessye Norman took Marianne's place, singing La Marseillaise as part of an elaborate pageant orchestrated by avant-garde designer Jean-Paul Goude. The Republic, after harsh internal fighting throughout the 19th century and even the 20th century (6 February 1934 crisis, Vichy, etc.), had become consensual; the vast majority of French citizens were now republicans, leading to a lesser importance of a cult of Marianne. Origin of the name Marianne in Jonzac (1894). The sculpture is similar to Liberty Enlightening the World, commonly known as the Statue of Liberty. At the time of the French Revolution, as the most common of people were fighting for their rights, it seemed fitting to name the Republic after the most common of French women's names: Marie (Mary) and Anne. The account made of their exploits by the Revolutionaries often contained a reference to a certain Marianne (or Marie-Anne) wearing a Phrygian cap. This pretty girl of legend inspired the revolutionaries, and looked after those wounded in the many battles across the country. A recent discovery establishes that the first written mention of the name of Marianne to designate the Republic appeared in October 1792 in Puylaurens in the Tarn d√©partement near Toulouse. At that time people used to sing a song in the Proven√ßal dialect of Occitan by the poet Guillaume Lavabre: \\"La garisou de Marianno\\" (French: \\"La gu√©rison de Marianne\\"; \\"Marianne's recovery (from illness)\\"). At the time Marie-Anne was a very popular first name; according to Agulhon, it \\"was chosen to designate a r√©gime that also saw itself as popular.\\"Agulhon 1981, p. 10. Some believe that the name came from the name of the Spanish Jesuit Juan de Mariana, the 16th century Monarchomach, a theoretician of tyrannicide. Others think it was the image of the wife of the politician Jean Reubell: according to an old 1797 story, Barras, one of the members of the Directoire, during an evening spent at Reubell's, asked his hostess for her name‚Äî\\"Marie-Anne,\\" she replied‚Äî\\"Perfect,\\" Barras exclaimed, \\"It is a short and simple name, which befits the Republic just as much as it does yourself, Madame.\\" The description by artist Honor√© Daumier in 1848, as a mother nursing two children, Romulus and Remus, or by sculptor Fran√ßois Rude, during the July Monarchy, as a warrior voicing the Marseillaise on the Arc de Triomphe, are uncertain. The name of Marianne also appears to be connected with several republican secret societies. During the Second Empire, one of them, whose members had sworn to overthrow the monarchy, had taken her name. In any case, she has become a symbol in France: considered as a personification of the Republic, she was often used on republican iconography ‚Äì and sometimes caricatured and reviled by those against the republic, especially royalists and monarchists. Models The official busts of Marianne initially had anonymous features, appearing as women of the people. From 1969, however, they began to take on the features of famous women, starting with the actress Brigitte Bardot. She was followed by Mireille Mathieu (1978), Catherine Deneuve (1985), In√®s de La Fressange (1989), Laetitia Casta (2000) and √âvelyne Thomas (2003). Laetitia Casta was named the symbolic representation of France's Republic in October 1999 in a vote open for the first time to the country's more than 36,000 mayors. She won from a shortlist of five candidates, scoring 36% among the 15,000 that voted. The other candidates were Estelle Hallyday, Patricia Kaas, Daniela Lumbroso, L√¶titia Milot and Nathalie Simon.Laetitia Casta as Marianne In July 2013, a new stamp featuring the Marianne was debuted by President Fran√ßois Hollande, allegedly designed by the team of Olivier Ciappa and David Kawena. Ciappa claimed that Inna Shevchenko, a high-profile member of the Ukrainian protest group FEMEN who had recently been granted political asylum in France, was a main inspiration for the new Marianne. However, Kawena and his attorney later claimed that Ciappa was falsely representing himself as having had any level of creative input on the artwork. Kawena further stated that Shevchenko, or any other figure that Ciappa claimed to be an inspiration, was in no way the model for the work, and has sued Ciappa for violation of copyright on the Marianne artwork. Ciappa later refuted the claims that Kawena was ignored, and also revealed his legal name (\\"David Kawena\\" being a pseudonym taken from the Lilo & Stitch films) in a retaliatory press release; Xavier H√©raud, a writer for Yagg (a French LGBT news site), noted that in a 2013 Huffington Post piece by Ciappa he never refers to Kawena and claims authorship of the images within the post. Yagg later reported on a response to their posting from Ciappa where he said that he was not in editorial control of the Huffington Post piece and did not intend to have the phrasing be \\"My Marianne\\" as accused by Kawena in his suit; Yagg later contacted Huffington Post who informed them that they sent a draft for Ciappa to look at prior to publishing, which is the current version of the article. Government logo Blue-white-red, Marianne, Libert√©-√âgalit√©-Fraternit√©, the Republic: these national symbols represent France, as a state and its values. Since September 1999, they have been combined in a new \\"identifier\\" created by the Plural Left government of Lionel Jospin under the aegis of the French Government Information Service (SIG) and the public relations officials in the principal ministries. As a federating identifier of the government departments, it appears on a wide range of material‚Äîbrochures, internal and external publications, publicity campaigns, letter headings, business cards, etc.‚Äîemanating from the government, starting with the various ministries (which are able to continue using their own logo in combination with this) and the pr√©fectures and d√©partements. Debate about Islamic dress Marianne has featured prominently in the Islamic scarf controversy in France as a symbol of a certain idea of Frenchness and femininity. The American gender historian Joan Wallach Scott wrote in 2016 that it is no accident that Marianne is often depicted as bare-breasted regardless of where she is or what she is doing, as this reflects the French ideal of a woman, which has been used as an argument for why Islamic dress for women is not French. Scott wrote the topless Marianne has become \\"...the embodiment of emancipated French women in contrast to the veiled woman said to be subordinated by Islam\\". Later in 2016, the French Premier Manuel Valls stated in a speech that the burkini swimsuit was an \\"enslavement\\" of women and that Marianne was usually topless which The Economist noted: \\"The implication seemed to be that women in burkinis are un- French, while true French women go topless.\\" In a speech on 29 August 2016, Valls said: \\"Marianne has a naked breast because she is feeding the people! She is not veiled, because she is free! That is the republic!\\". Angelique Chisafis of The Guardian newspaper reported: \\"The inference that bare breasts were a symbol of France while the Muslim headscarf was problematic sparked scorn from politicians and derision from historians and feminists\\". The French president Fran√ßois Hollande sparked much debate in France with his controversial statement \\"The veiled woman will be the Marianne of tomorrow\\". Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic logo The Marianne is one of the elements of the official emblem of the 2024 Summer Olympics and the 2024 Summer Paralympics in Paris, combined with the gold medal and the Olympic and Paralympic flame, which is the first time in history with the same emblem.

Sacks chose the title of the book from the case study of one of his patients, whom he calls \\"Dr. P\\"; P has visual agnosia,Sacks, Oliver. The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. Touchstone, 1998, pp. 8‚Äì22 a neurological condition that leaves him unable to recognize faces (even of familiar people) and (even familiar) objects. The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat became the basis of an opera of the same name by Michael Nyman, which premiered in 1986. The book comprises twenty-four essays split into four sections (\\"Losses\\", \\"Excesses\\", \\"Transports\\", and \\"The World of the Simple\\"), each dealing with a particular aspect of brain function. The first two sections discuss deficits and excesses (with particular emphasis on the right hemisphere of the brain), while the third and fourth sections describe phenomenological manifestations with reference to spontaneous reminiscences, altered perceptions, and extraordinary qualities of mind found in people with intellectual disabilities.  Content  The individual essays in this book include: * \\"The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat\\", about Dr. P, who has visual agnosia; however, before that diagnosis is reached, Dr. P consults an ophthalmologist when he develops diabetes, thinking that it might affect his vision. The ophthalmologist tells him that he does not have diabetes and instead refers him to Dr. Sacks (the author), to whom Dr. P describes his symptoms of visual agnosia. * \\"The Lost Mariner\\", about Jimmie G., who has anterograde amnesia (the loss of the ability to form new memories) due to Korsakoff's syndrome. He can remember nothing of his life since the end of World War II, including events that happened only a few minutes ago. He believes it is still 1945 (the segment covers his life in the 1970s and early 1980s), and seems to behave as a normal, intelligent young man aside from his inability to remember most of his past and the events of his day-to-day life. He struggles to find meaning, satisfaction, and happiness in the midst of constantly forgetting what he is doing from one moment to the next. * \\"The President's Speech\\", about a ward of aphasiacs and agnosiacs listening to a speech given by an unnamed actor- president, \\"the old charmer\\", presumably Ronald Reagan. Many in the first group laughed at the speech, despite their inability to follow the words, and Sacks claims their laughter to be at the president's facial expressions and tone, which they find \\"not genuine\\". One woman in the latter group criticizes the structure of the president's sentences, stating that he \\"does not speak good prose\\". * \\"The Disembodied Lady\\", a unique case of a woman losing her entire sense of proprioception (the sense of the position of parts of the body, relative to other neighbouring parts of the body) due to vitamin b6 toxicity. * \\"The Man Who Fell out of Bed\\", about a young man whom Dr. Sacks sees as a medical student. Sacks encounters the patient on the floor of his hospital room, where he tells Sacks that he woke up to find an alien leg in his bed. Assuming that one of the nurses had played a prank on him, he attempted to toss the leg out of bed, only to find that he was attached to it. Although Sacks attempts to persuade the patient that the leg is his own, he remains bewildered in an apparent case of somatoparaphrenia. * \\"On the Level\\", another case involving damaged proprioception. Dr. Sacks interviews a patient who has trouble walking upright and discovers that he has lost his innate sense of balance due to Parkinson's-like symptoms that have damaged his inner ears; the patient, comparing his sense of balance to a carpenter's spirit level, suggested constructing a similar level inside a pair of glasses. This enables him to judge his balance by sight and after a few weeks, the task of keeping his eye on the level became less tiring. * \\"The Twins\\", about autistic savants. Dr. Sacks meets twin brothers who can neither read nor perform multiplication, yet are playing a \\"game\\" of finding very large prime numbers. While the twins were able to spontaneously generate these numbers, from six to twenty digits, Sacks had to resort to a book of prime numbers to join in with them. This was used in the 1993 film House of Cards starring Tommy Lee Jones. The twins also instantly count 111 dropped matches, simultaneously remarking that 111 is three 37s, an ability demonstrated by Dustin Hoffman's autistic character in the 1988 film Rain Man. This story has been questioned by Makoto Yamaguchi, who doubts that a book of large prime numbers could exist as described, and points out that reliable scientific reports only support approximate perception when rapidly counting large numbers of items. Autistic savant Daniel Tammet points out that the twins provided the matchbox and may have counted its contents beforehand, noting that he finds the value of 111 to be \\"particularly beautiful and matchstick-like\\". * \\"Eyes Right\\", about a woman in her sixties who has hemispatial neglect. She completely forgets the idea of \\"left\\" relative to her own body and the world around her. When nurses place food or drink on her left side, she fails to recognize that they are there. Dr. Sacks attempts to show the patient the left side of her body using a video screen setup; when the patient sees the left side of her body, on her right, she is overwhelmed with anxiety and asked for it to stop. * \\"The Dog Beneath the Skin\\", concerning a 22-year-old medical student, \\"Stephen D.\\", who, after a night under the influence of amphetamines, cocaine, and PCP, wakes to find he has a tremendously heightened sense of smell. Sacks would reveal many years later that he, in fact, was Stephen D. * \\"The Autist Artist\\", about a 21-year- old named Jose that had been deemed \\"hopelessly retarded\\" and had seizures; however, when given Sacks' pocket watch and asked to draw it, he composed himself and drew the watch in surprising detail. In popular culture Christopher Rawlence wrote the libretto for a chamber opera‚Äîdirected by Michael Morris with music by Michael Nyman‚Äîbased on the title story. The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat was first produced by the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1986. A television version of the opera was subsequently broadcast in the UK. Peter Brook adapted Sacks's book into an acclaimed theatrical production, L'Homme Qui..., which premiered at the Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes du Nord, Paris, in 1993. An Indian theatre company performed a play entitled The Blue Mug, based on the book, starring Rajat Kapoor, Konkona Sen Sharma, Ranvir Shorey, and Vinay Pathak. The Man Who, an album by the Scottish indie pop band Travis, is named after this book.. In an episode of the television show Parks and Recreation, the surprising nature of Jerry Gergich's relationship with his gorgeous wife, Gayle (Christie Brinkley), is hypothesized as an example of a case in this book.

Korean Confucianism is the form of Confucianism that emerged and developed in Korea. One of the most substantial influences in Korean intellectual history was the introduction of Confucian thought as part of the cultural influence from China. Today the legacy of Confucianism remains a fundamental part of Korean society, shaping the moral system, the way of life, social relations between old and young, high culture, and is the basis for much of the legal system. Confucianism in Korea is sometimes considered a pragmatic way of holding a nation together without the civil wars and internal dissent that were inherited from the Goryeo dynasty. Origins of Confucian thought Confucius (Â≠îÂ§´Â≠ê K«íng F≈´z«ê, lit. \\"Master Kong\\") is generally thought to have been born in 551 BCE and raised by his mother following the death of his father when Confucius was three years old. The Latinized name \\"Confucius\\" by which most Westerners recognize him is derived from \\"Kong Fuzi\\", probably first coined by 16th-century Jesuit missionaries to China. The Analects, or Lunyu (Ë´ñË™û; lit.\\"Selected Sayings\\"), a collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher and his contemporaries, is believed to have been written by Confucius' followers during the Warring States period (475 BC ‚Äì 221 BC), achieving its final form during the Han dynasty (206 BC ‚Äì 220 AD). Confucius was born into the class of shi (Â£´), between the aristocracy and the common people. His public life included marriage at the age of 19 that produced a son and a variety of occupations as a farm worker, clerk and book- keeper. In his private life he studied and reflected on righteousness, proper conduct and the nature of government such that by the age of 50 he had established a reputation. This regard, however was insufficient for his success in advocating for a strong central government and the use of diplomacy over warfare as the ideal for international relationships. He is said to have spent his last years teaching an ardent group of followers of the values to be appreciated in a collection of ancient writings loosely identified as the Five Classics. Confucius is thought to have died in 479 BCE. Under the succeeding Han dynasty and Tang dynasty, Confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence. During the Song dynasty, the scholar Zhu Xi (AD 1130‚Äì1200) added ideas from Taoism and Buddhism into Confucianism. In his life, Zhu Xi was largely ignored, but not long after his death his ideas became the new orthodox view of what Confucian texts actually meant. Modern historians view Zhu Xi as having created something rather different, and call his way of thinking Neo-Confucianism. Neo-Confucianism held sway in China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam until the 19th century. Early developments towards Confucianism in Korea =Before Goryeo= The nature of early Korean political and cultural organization centered on the clan and the tribe rather than cities and states. A Chinese record of the Gojoseon Kingdom (1000 BC ‚Äì 300 BC) labeled the inhabitants of the peninsula as DONG-I or \\"eastern barbarians\\" or \\"eastern bowmen\\". Though the Shang dynasty (1600 BC ‚Äì 1040 BC) is recognized chiefly for its metallurgical accomplishments, its organizational accomplishments included the invocation of authority through one's ancestors. When the Shang Dynasty was overtaken by the Western Zhou (1122 BC ‚Äì 771 BC), the Zhou modified the Shang belief in ancestors belief to invoke the \\"Mandate of Heaven\\" as a way of identifying the divine right to rule. The Mandate of Heaven was based on rules of good governance and the emperor was granted the right to rule by heaven as long as those rules of good governance were obeyed. The scattered rule of many semi-autonomous holdings were increasingly brought under the rule of a central government as a Zongfa or \\"kinship network\\" though as time went on the territory ruled was far too large for all vassals to be actual blood relatives. Vassals to the king enjoyed hereditary titles and were expected to provide labor and fighting forces as circumstances merited. In these many ways, the Gojoseon kingdom would have been ‚Äúvalidated‚Äù by their ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù to the south, and while the Gojoseon king would still rule, the ‚ÄúMandate of Heaven‚Äù lay obligations on him to rule justly and fairly and for the benefit of his people and not just his favorites or relatives. As the Western Zhou declined, China entered into a period known as the Spring and Autumn period (771 BC ‚Äì 471BC) and the \\"kinship network\\" also declined. Control of many feudal holdings fell to feudal lords and knights, or \\"fighting gentlemen\\", (C. SHI). Unbound by family relationships, these men were free to attack their neighbors and accrue holdings. It was into this period, then, that Confucius was born and spent his entire life seeming to strive for the construction of a governmental ideal in the nature of the Zhou centralized government. However, in 109 BC the Han Emperor, Wu-Ti overwhelmed Gojoseon by both land and sea and established four bases, or \\"commanderies\\", Four Commanderies of Han in the region as a way to stabilize the area for trade. The subsequent introduction of four separate administrations to oversee the region only served to prolong the divided nature of the Korean peninsula and hamper an adoption of the Confucian model. As the Three Kingdoms Period emerged from the Four Commanderies, each Kingdom sought ideologies under which their populations could be consolidated and authority could be validated. From its introduction to the kingdom of Baekje in 338 AD, Korean Buddhism spread rapidly to all of the states of the Three Kingdoms Period. Though Korean Shamanism had been an integral part of Korean culture extending back to earliest time, Buddhism was able to strike a balance between the people and their administration by arbitrating the responsibilities of one to the other. =Goryeo period= By the time of the Goryeo Dynasty (918‚Äì1392) the position, influence, and status of Buddhism far exceeded its role as a mere religious faith. Buddhist temples, originally established as acts of faith had grown into influential landholdings replete with extensive infra-structure, cadre, tenants, slaves and commercial ventures. The state observed a number of Buddhist holidays during the year where the prosperity and security of the nation were inextricably tied to practices and rites that often mixed Buddhist and indigenous Korean beliefs. As in China, Buddhism divided into the more urban faith rooted religious texts and the more contemplative faith of the rural areas. This emphasis on texts and learning produced a \\"monk examination\\" wherein the Buddhist clergy could vie with Confucian scholars for positions in the local and national government. During this time, Confucian thought remained in the shadow of its Buddhist rival, vying for the hearts and minds of Korean culture, but with growing antagonism. With the fall of Goryeo, the position of the landed aristocracy crumbled to be replaced by the growing power of the Korean illiterati who advocated strenuously for land reform. Interest in Chinese literature during the Goryeo Dynasty had encouraged the spread of Neo-Confucianism, in which the older teachings of Confucius had been melded to Taoism and Buddhism. Neo-Confucian adherents could now offer the new Joseon Dynasty (1392‚Äì1910) an alternative to the influence of Buddhism. In Goryeo, King Gwangjong (949‚Äì975) had created the national civil service examinations, and King Seongjong (1083‚Äì1094) was a key advocate for Confucianism by establishing the Gukjagam, the highest educational institution of the Goryeo dynasty. This was enhanced, in 1398, by the Sunggyungwan ‚Äì an academy with a Neo-Confucian curriculum ‚Äì and the building of an altar at the palace, where the king would worship his ancestors. Neo-Confucian thought, with its emphasis on Ethics and the government's moral authority provided considerable rationale for land reform and redistribution of wealth. Rather than attack Buddhism outright, Neo-Confucian critics simply continued to criticize the system of Temples and the excesses of the clergy. Neo- Confucianism in the Joseon dynasty Portrait of Jo Gwang-jo By the time of King Sejong (ruled 1418‚Äì1450), all branches of learning were rooted in Confucian thought. Korean Confucian schools were firmly established, most with foreign educated scholars, large libraries, patronage of artisans and artists, and a curriculum of 13 to 15 major Confucian works. Branches of Buddhism in Korea were still tolerated outside of the major political centers. In Ming China (1368‚Äì1644), Neo-Confucianism had been adopted as the state ideology. The new Joseon Dynasty (1392‚Äì1910) followed suit and also adopted Neo- Confucianism as the primary belief system among scholars and administrators. Jo Gwangjo's efforts to promulgate Neo-Confucianism among the populace had been followed by appearance of Korea's two most prominent Confucian scholars, Yi Hwang (1501‚Äì1570) and Yi I (1536‚Äì1584), who are often referred to by their pen names Toe gye and Yul gok. Having supplanted all other models for the Korean nation-state, by the start of the 17th century, Neo-Confucian thought experienced first a split between Westerners and Easterners and again, between Southerners and Northerners. Central to these divisions was the question of succession in the Korean monarchy and the manner in which opposing factions should be dealt. A growing number of Neo-Confucian scholars had also begun to question particular metaphysical beliefs and practices. A movement known as Silhak (lit. \\"practical learning\\") posited that Neo-Confucian thought ought be founded more in reform than in maintaining the status quo. Differences among various Confucian and Neo-Confucian schools of thought grew to conflicts as Western countries sought to force open Korean, Chinese and Japanese societies to Western trade, Western technologies and Western institutions. Of particular concern were the growing number of Catholic and Protestant missionary schools which not only taught a Western pedagogy but also Christian religious beliefs. In 1894, Korean Conservatives, nationalists and Neo-Confucians rebelled at what they viewed as the loss of Korean Society and Culture to alien influences by the abandonment of the Chinese classics and Confucian rites. The Donghak Rebellion‚Äîalso called the 1894 Peasant War (Nongmin Jeonjaeng)‚Äîexpanded on the actions of the small groups of the Donghak (lit. Eastern Learning) movement begun in 1892. Uniting into a single peasant guerrilla army (Donghak Peasant Army) the rebels armed themselves, raided government offices and killed rich landlords, traders and foreigners. The defeat of the Dong Hak rebels drove ardent Neo-Confucians out of the cities and into the rural and isolated areas of the country. However, the rebellion had pulled China into the conflict and in direct contention with Japan (First Sino-Japanese War). With the subsequent defeat of Qing China, Korea was wrested from Chinese influence concerning its administration and development. In 1904, the Japanese defeated Russia (Russo- Japanese War) ending Russian influence in Korea as well. As a result, Japan annexed Korea as a protectorate in 1910, ending the Joseon kingdom and producing a thirty-year occupation (Korea under Japanese rule) which sought to substitute Japanese culture for that of Korea. During this period, a Japanese administration imposed Japanese language, Japanese education, Japanese practices and even Japanese surnames on the Korean population predominantly in the large cities and surrounding suburban areas. However, in the isolated areas of Korea, and well into Manchuria, Korean nationals continued to wage a guerrilla war against the Japanese and found sympathy for Neo-Confucian goals of reform and economic parity among the growing Communist movement. With the end of the Japanese occupation, Confucian and Neo-Confucian thought continued to experience neglect if not willful repression during the Korean War as well as the repressive dictatorships which followed. Contemporary society and Confucianism With the fall of the Joseon Dynasty in 1910, Neo-Confucianism lost a lot of its influence.Baker, Don. Korean Spirituality (University of Hawai‚Äôi Press, 2008). p 53Koh, Byong-ik. ‚ÄúConfucianism in Contemporary Korea,‚Äù In Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity, edited by Tu Wei-ming, (Harvard University Press, 1996) p 193 In contemporary South Korea, very few people identify themselves as being Confucian when asked for their religious affiliation.Baker, Donald. ‚ÄúThe Transformation of Confucianism in 20th-century Korea: How it has lost most of its metaphysical underpinnings and survives today primarily as ethical rhetoric and heritage rituals‚Äù ÌïúÍµ≠ÌïôÏó∞Íµ¨Ïõê ÌïôÏà†ÎåÄÌöå. p 107Koh, Byong-ik. ‚ÄúConfucianism in Contemporary Korea,‚Äù In Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity, edited by Tu Wei-ming, (Harvard University Press, 1996) p 192 The statistical studies done on this subject can be misleading, however. Confucianism there is not an organized religion, making it hard to easily define a person as Confucian or not.Kim, Kwang-ok. ‚ÄúThe Reproduction of Confucian Culture in Contemporary Korea: An Anthropological Study,‚Äù In Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity, edited by Tu Wei- ming, (Harvard University Press, 1996) p 226 Though its prominence as the dominant ideology has faded, there are a lot of Confucian ideas and practices that still saturate South Korean culture and daily life.Kim, Kwang-ok. ‚ÄúThe Reproduction of Confucian Culture in Contemporary Korea: An Anthropological Study,‚Äù In Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity, edited by Tu Wei- ming, (Harvard University Press, 1996) p 204Kim, Kwang-ok. ‚ÄúThe Reproduction of Confucian Culture in Contemporary Korea: An Anthropological Study,‚Äù In Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity, edited by Tu Wei-ming, (Harvard University Press, 1996) p 225Koh, Byong-ik. ‚ÄúConfucianism in Contemporary Korea,‚Äù In Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity, edited by Tu Wei- ming, (Harvard University Press, 1996) p 199 The traditional Confucian respect for education remains a vital part of South Korean culture.Baker, Donald. ‚ÄúThe Transformation of Confucianism in 20th-century Korea: How it has lost most of its metaphysical underpinnings and survives today primarily as ethical rhetoric and heritage rituals‚Äù Unpublished paper. p 4 The civil service examinations were the gateway to prestige and power for a follower of Confucianism in the Joseon Dynasty. Today, exams continue to be an important aspect of South Korean life. The content of what is studied has changed over the years. Confucian teachings were replaced by other topics, such as foreign languages, modern history, economics, science, and mathematics. Like Confucianism from the past, a lot of emphasis is placed on the ability to study and memorize.Vogel, Ezra. The Four Little Dragons (Harvard University Press, 1991) p 96 Since exams are so important for gaining admission to better schools and jobs, a typical student‚Äôs entire life is oriented toward preparing to pass the necessary exams.Vogel, Ezra. The Four Little Dragons (Harvard University Press, 1991) p 97 Perhaps some of the strongest evidences of continuing Confucian influence can be found in South Korean family life. It is seen not just in South Korea‚Äôs emphasis on family and group-oriented ways of living, but also in the Confucian rituals that are still commonly performed today, the ancestor memorial services. It is a way of showing respect for deceased parents, grandparents, and ancestors, and is a way of showing Confucian filial piety.Koh, Byong-ik. ‚ÄúConfucianism in Contemporary Korea,‚Äù In Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity, edited by Tu Wei-ming, (Harvard University Press, 1996) p 195 In some cases, the memorial services have been changed to fit with religious views. This is an example of how Confucianism has melded with religion in South Korea, rather than competing against it.Baker, Don. Korean Spirituality (University of Hawai‚Äôi Press, 2008). p 138 In 1980, the ‚ÄúGuideline for Family Rituals‚Äù was made law. It declared that ancestral ceremonies can only be held for one‚Äôs parents and grandparents, simplified the funeral ceremonies, and reduced the allowed mourning period. The law is not strictly enforced, and no one has been charged for violating it. In more recent years, there has been a move away from the traditional Confucian idea of complete respect for and submission to parental authority. It can be seen in how marriage has become less of a family decision, and more of an individual‚Äôs choice.Baker, Donald. ‚ÄúThe Transformation of Confucianism in 20th-century Korea: How it has lost most of its metaphysical underpinnings and survives today primarily as ethical rhetoric and heritage rituals‚Äù Unpublished paper. p 5 The Confucian emphasis on the importance of the family and the group over the individual has been extended to South Korean business, as well. Employees are expected to regard the workplace as a family, with the head of the company as the patriarch who enjoys exclusive privileges while the workers are expected to work harder. The businesses tend to operate on Confucian ethics, such as the importance of harmonious relations among the employees and loyalty to the company. Importance is placed on attributes such as differences in age, kinship status, sex, and sociopolitical status.Kim, Kwang-ok. ‚ÄúThe Reproduction of Confucian Culture in Contemporary Korea: An Anthropological Study,‚Äù In Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity, edited by Tu Wei-ming, (Harvard University Press, 1996) p 220Kim, Andrew Eungi & Gil-sung Park. ‚ÄúNationalism, Confucianism, work ethic and industrialization in South Korea,‚Äù Journal of Contemporary Asia 33:1 (2003) p 44. Available at http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00472330380000041#.UqhOpPRDvh4 Confucian ethical rhetoric is still used in contemporary South Korea. Other religions will incorporate it into discussions on proper human behavior. It can be found in the government and in the business world being used to encourage people to put the needs of the group above their own individual needs.Baker, Donald. ‚ÄúThe Transformation of Confucianism in 20th-century Korea: How it has lost most of its metaphysical underpinnings and survives today primarily as ethical rhetoric and heritage rituals‚Äù Unpublished paper. p 7 Neo-Confucian philosophy going back to the 15th Century had relegated Korean women to little more than extensions of male dominance and producers of requisite progeny. This traditional view of the social role of women is fading away. There is an increasing number of women students holding good positions in universities and the work force, as well as in politics.Baker, Donald. ‚ÄúThe Transformation of Confucianism in 20th-century Korea: How it has lost most of its metaphysical underpinnings and survives today primarily as ethical rhetoric and heritage rituals‚Äù Unpublished paper. p 6 The former president of South Korea, Park Geun-hye, is female. The arts still maintain major traditions: Korean Pottery, the Korean Tea Ceremony, Korean Gardens, and Korean flower arrangement follow Confucian principles and a Confucian aesthetic. Scholarly calligraphy and poetry also continue, in much fewer numbers, this heritage. In films, school stories of manners and comic situations within educational frames fit well into the satires on Confucianism from earlier writings. Loyalty to school and devotion to teachers is still an important genre in popular comedies. With Neo-Confucianism taken out of the school curricula and removed from its prominence in the daily life of Koreans, the sense that something essential to Korean history is missing led to a rebirth of Confucianism in South Korea in the late 1990s. It is difficult to find accurate information regarding Confucianism in North Korean religion or practices.Baker, Don. Korean Spirituality (University of Hawai‚Äôi Press, 2008). p 145 However, the Juche ideology does encourage the Confucian virtues of loyalty, reverence, and obedience.Baker, Don. Korean Spirituality (University of Hawai‚Äôi Press, 2008). p 150  Contemporary Confucianism and Women's Rights  Traditionally women in Korea were given the role of housewife due to Confucian gender roles. Meaning women were not allowed to work outside the house. This started to change and by 2001 the women's participation in the workforce was at 49.7 percent compared to only 34.4 percent in the 1960s. In 1987 equal opportunity legislation was introduced and been improved by reforms since then to improve the rights of working women. As Korean feminist organizations gained more influence the government listened, and in 2000 established the Department of Gender Equality to allow women to participate in making policy. Even though women are gaining by working right, it has not fully changed the roles when at the house. Working women are still expected to be the primary domestic worker in the family. However, these changes have given women in south Korea more of an option between being a housewife or working outside of the house. The women who have chosen to work due to the changes in government and legislation had and still have major challenges to face in the workforce. Major companies in South Korea began to change their hiring practices such as Samsung which was one of the first major companies to do so. In 1997 Samsung removed gender discrimination in recruitment and by 2012 had hired 56,000 women employees Lee, B. J., & Ki-jun, L. (2012). Shattering South Korea‚Äôs Ceiling. Newsweek (Atlantic Edition), 160(6), 10. Retrieved from http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.umuc.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=heh&AN;=78238861&site;=eds- live&scope;=site. However, before 1997 some women did manage to work at Samsung, and there was discrimination in the patriarchally-ran company. Most of the jobs of the woman who worked at Samsung were low-level workers. When the company tried to offer higher positions to women, many of the top male executives took advantage of the women and gave them menial chores, not unlike how some husbands may expect of their wives at home. However, this all began to change in 1994 when an open personnel reform from Samsung‚Äôs chairman, forced top executives to treat and pay men and women equally. Samsung‚Äôs newest goal is increasing the percentage of female top executives from 2 percent to 10 percent by 2020. Still today however in South Korea, women are being discriminated against especially in work environments.
