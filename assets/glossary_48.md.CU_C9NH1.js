The show is syndicated throughout North America on Westwood One. It is known for outrageous guests, the majority of whom are fictional and voiced live by the host, Phil Hendrie. Though Hendrie often explains that he is doing the voices, listeners unfamiliar with the show's format are duped into believing that the guests on the show are real and are invited to call in to engage in conversation with the \\"guests\\". Historically, the show was known as The Phil Hendrie Show. It has had previous stints airing on Premiere Networks and Talk Radio Network under that name.  Show history = 1990‚Äì2006 (\\"Classic Phil\\")  The show ran for nearly 16 years, from August 1990 to June 23, 2006. Hendrie began doing voices on his program at KVEN in Ventura, California during the Gulf War when he created \\"Raj Fahneen,\\" an Egyptian who demanded that George H. W. Bush wash Saddam Hussein's feet with his hair. After leaving KVEN in 1992, Hendrie did a short stint as an evening host at WSB in Atlanta before moving to WCCO in Minneapolis. Phil left WCCO on March 12, 1994 and moved to WIOD in Miami. Hendrie hosted the afternoon drive-time slot, and further developed his characters' personalities, adding their lasting traits. He garnered a large fan base there, and released three \\"Best Of\\" CDs, all of which benefited the Miami charity organization Center One. In 1996, Hendrie moved to KFI in Los Angeles to further develop his show and reach a larger audience. In 1996, Hendrie became syndicated and eventually reached around 100 affiliates. In October 1999, Phil moved to Premiere Radio Networks, which eventually distributed his shows via the Internet. In February 2005, Hendrie's show moved to XTRA Sports 570 (KLAC), deemed a better fit for his show's mostly male audience, though it wasn't Hendrie's idea. John Ziegler, a local Los Angeles conservative talk show host, moved into his slot on KFI. In early 2006, Hendrie announced that he was retiring from radio. He said that he felt he had reached the limits of what he could do in ‚Äúterrestrial talk radio‚Äù and expressing a desire to shift his career focus toward acting.UPI Phil Hendrie retiring from radio. United Press International, Inc. 28 April 2008. Reruns continued on KLAC in Los Angeles through November 2006 and CKTB until April 2007. The CKTB airing featured an unofficial \\"best-of\\", airing for 3 hours every Saturday night. The program was meticulously programmed by Producer Stephen Dohnberg, who culled Hendrie bits from his own archives, archives that often featured rare and classic Hendrie segments. Each week featured a theme that was consistent with calendar events, anniversaries of historical events, and current events, among others.  2007‚Äì2009 (Political commentary)  In June 2007, Hendrie announced he was returning to the airwaves at Talk Radio Network, starting almost exactly a year from the day of his retirement (June 25) in a later time slot (10 PM-1 AM PT). This show's format was talk radio commentary, covering political issues and news headlines of the day. Hendrie's mock guests returned to the show after a few weeks, but they did not interact with callers. Within a month of the show's relaunch, Hendrie's show had already achieved forty affiliates, although in one notable instance Brian Maloney reported that in Boston, Hendrie affiliate WTKK saw its listenership drop 91% in the overnights after Hendrie started airing in the slot.Maloney, Brian. Boston ratings breakdowns: Imus, Severin up. SaveWRKO.com. 21 January 2008. Callers were included only sparingly in the show, starting with a segment featuring Bob Greene and an unsuspecting female caller on May 2, 2008.  October 2009 ‚Äì June 2013  On October 2009, Phil posted from his Twitter: \\"The Original Phil Hendrie Show has returned.....\\" The show returned to its classic format, consisting mostly of comedy characters such as Bobbie Dooley and Steven Bosell presenting controversial topics and engaging with actual callers. The political commentary was significantly marginalized. Talk Radio Network cancelled The Phil Hendrie Show in June 2013 amid significant acrimony.TRN pulling the Phil Hendrie Show. Radio and Television Business Report. Retrieved June 17, 2013.  June 2013 to present  Hendrie signed a distribution deal with Dial Global (which rebranded itself as Westwood One later that year) shortly after his contract with TRN had been cancelled. The deal will have WYD Media (the same company responsible for producing Dial Global's progressive talk offerings) produce the show while Dial Global distributes and sells advertising. The show will return to the time slot it held during its run on Premiere. Show format The show's format was a combination of commentary and character sketches. The commentary usually addressed news headlines, political and social perspectives, and Phil's personal life, while the character sketches consisted of personalities performed by Phil. Typically, three consecutive hour-long blocks were devoted to commentary and variety, with the next three hour-long blocks consisting of character sketches. These character sketches were usually closed with several minutes of commentary and variety. Throughout the show during the Premiere years, Phil often promoted My Friend's Place, a resource center for homeless youth based in Hollywood, California, and donated all the proceeds from the sales of his \\"Best Of\\" CDs to the center. This charity was selected after another refused because of the purported offensiveness of his show.  Commentary  Throughout the show, Hendrie provided personal opinions and commentary on his life, career, and various news stories. The number of these segments devoted to political commentary increased following the September 11, 2001 attacks, as he has become a staunch supporter of President Bush's war on terrorism. A longtime Democrat and staunchly liberal on a number of issues, Hendrie has strongly voiced opposition to the Democratic Party in recent years, accusing it of having lost touch with its core constituents and failing to adequately engage with a philosophy to win the war on terror. Beginning in June 2003, however, The Phil Hendrie Show decreased the number of \\"serious\\" segments in Hendrie's own voice and returned to the commentary-through-satire which originally made him famous. The 2007 revival of the program resembles primarily these \\"serious\\" segments.  Character sketches  Hendrie was known for his repertoire of fictional personalities, each with a controversial or irritating trait. For example, Steve Bosel is an emotionally fragile business owner who files frivolous lawsuits which he discusses in a quavering voice, while Jay Santos is a self-appointed neighborhood watch commander who oversteps his authority‚Äîoften to satisfy his own sexual kinks. Occasionally the characters were performed by Hendrie to add perspective and humor to his commentaries. However, many of the hour-long segments were devoted almost entirely to character sketches. In this format, Hendrie would host a debate, performing one of his characters with a controversial issue, such as Jay Santos who enters homes randomly in order to teach home invasion awareness. After the introduction, Hendrie allowed unsuspecting listeners to call in and engage with the character. A new and outrageous element was usually introduced at that point, and by the final segment, an even larger item of controversy entered the conversation. Hendrie playing the role of good cop/bad cop, feigning indignation at the character's comments and finally hanging up on his guest. Hendrie simply described the premise as \\"[we] come up with different goofy characters, and then people call in who don't know that they're fake.\\"Phil Hendrie Show, Premiere Radio Networks, October 18, 2001. To accomplish this illusion, Hendrie switched back and forth between a studio microphone and a conventional telephone while speaking, creating the impression that his \\"guest\\" was a random caller. The illusion was reinforced by recorded background noises that simulated various locations, such as a bowling alley, the kitchen of a restaurant, or, on at least one occasion, a washroom. Hendrie was quite clear about the illusion, often ending the show with a remark like The guests were performed by me, Phil Hendrie, and the people that called in, they thought they were real guys. He often commented on his show that the actual point of the show was the callers' reaction to his \\"guests\\", not the guests themselves, and that he was merely illustrating his perception about the ignorance of talk radio listeners. While Hendrie's was not the first nor the only show that featured fictional characters, it became a staple of his programming style. His guests were initially portrayed as real people, though in later years Hendrie ended his shows crediting himself for the guest's performance. In earlier shows (particularly during his stint at WIOD in Miami) Hendrie would field real complaint calls to the station in a one-on-one format with the callers, pretending to be station manager Bob Green, the station's rabbi, or in one case, \\"Director of Accounts\\" at Century Village, a local retirement community. Hendrie's only regular in-studio characters were Bud Dickman, a brain-damaged intern with a cartoonish Kermit the Frog-like voice, and Robert Leonard, a black security guard. Hendrie has also impersonated actual celebrities and public figures on his show. Two of his most frequent impersonations were fellow radio hosts Tom Leykis (with whom Hendrie feuded) and Art Bell (whose program Hendrie enjoyed but nonetheless lampooned).

It is defined as the ratio of the thermal efficiency of an actual system compared to an idealized or reversible version of the system for heat engines. It can also be described as the ratio of the useful work output of the system to the reversible work output for work-consuming systems. For refrigerators and heat pumps, it is the ratio of the actual COP and reversible COP. Motivation The reason the second-law efficiency is needed is because the first-law efficiencies fail to take into account an idealized version of the system for comparison. Using first-law efficiencies alone, can lead one to believe a system is more efficient than it is in reality. So, the second-law efficiencies are needed to gain a more realistic picture of a system's effectiveness. From the second law of thermodynamics it can be demonstrated that no system can ever be 100% efficient. Definition The exergy B balance of a process gives: : B_{in}=B_{out}+B_{lost}+B_{destroyed} \\\\qquad \\\\mbox{(1)} with exergy efficiency defined as: : \\\\eta_B = \\\\frac{B_{out}}{B_{in}} = 1 - \\\\frac{(B_{lost}+B_{destroyed})}{B_{in}} \\\\qquad \\\\mbox{(2)} For many engineering systems this can be rephrased as: : \\\\eta_{B} = \\\\frac{\\\\dot{W}_{net}}{\\\\dot{m}_{fuel} \\\\Delta G^{0}_{T}} \\\\qquad \\\\mbox{(3)} Where \\\\Delta G^{0}_{T} is the standard Gibbs (free) energy of reaction at temperature T and pressure p_{0} = 1 \\\\mathrm{bar} (also known as the standard Gibbs function change), \\\\dot{W}_{net} is the net work output and \\\\dot{m}_{fuel} is the mass flow rate of fuel. In the same way the energy efficiency can be defined as: : \\\\eta_{E} = \\\\frac{\\\\dot{W}_{net}}{\\\\dot{m}_{fuel} \\\\Delta H^{0}_{T}} \\\\qquad \\\\mbox{(4)} Where \\\\Delta H^{0}_{T} is the standard enthalpy of reaction at temperature T and pressure p_{0} = 1 \\\\mathrm{bar} , for all fuels \\\\Delta G^{0}_{T} < \\\\Delta H^{0}_{T} so the exergy efficiency must always be greater than the energy efficiency. Application The destruction of exergy is closely related to the creation of entropy and as such any system containing highly irreversible processes will have a low energy efficiency. As an example the combustion process inside a power stations gas turbine is highly irreversible and approximately 25% of the exergy input will be destroyed here. For fossil fuels the free enthalpy of reaction is usually only slightly less than the enthalpy of reaction so from equations (3) and (4) we can see that the energy efficiency will be correspondingly larger than the energy law efficiency. For example, a typical combined cycle power plant burning methane may have an energy efficiency of 55%, while its exergy efficiency will be 57%. A 100% exergy efficient methane fired power station would correspond to an energy efficiency of 98%. This means that for many of the fuels we use, the maximum efficiency that can be achieved is >90%, however we are restricted to the Carnot efficiency in many situations as a heat engine is being used. Regarding Carnot heat engine A common misconception is that the exergy efficiency compares a given cycle to a Carnot heat engine. This is incorrect because a Carnot engine is the most efficient heat engine possible, but not the most efficient device for creating work. Fuel cells, for instance, can theoretically reach much higher efficiencies than a Carnot engine. Second law efficiency under maximum power Neither the first nor the second law of thermodynamics includes a measure of the rate of energy transformation. When a measure of the maximal rate of energy transformation is included in the measure of second law efficiency it is known as second law efficiency under maximum power, and directly related to the maximum power principle (Gilliland 1978, p. 101).

The street runs through what was a deer park of Sir Elijah Impey, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Calcutta from 1773 to 1789, hence the earlier name. Its current official name was given by Kolkata Municipal Corporation in honour of Mother Teresa. History Park Street in the 1930s Park Street in the 1930s Documented records of the throughfare can be traced back to 1760, when Kolkata (then Calcutta) was the capital of the British Empire in India. Since 1760, the street has been through several name changes. Previous names include 'Ghorustan ka Rasta', Vansittart Avenue and Burial Ground Road. Some 250 years ago, Park Street was known as Burial Ground Road and was not a preferred choice of residence, as there were a number of cemeteries in this area, the South Park Street Cemetery, opposite to it was the North Park Street Cemetery (now replaced by a school). Further west, there were two smaller cemeteries, one French and one Italian (now replaced by offices and schools). Park Street has been the main evening recreation zone for Kolkata people since the British era. In the 1970s and 1980s much of Kolkata's night life took place in Park Street, with many clubs and restaurants situated there. Many noted musicians had played at various popular night spots, such as Trinca's, Peter Cat, Oly Pub, Blue Fox, Mocambo and Moulin Rouge. Even before that, from the 1940s through to the late 1960s, Kolkata's prolific night life was centred on fashionable Park Street. The Park Hotel chain started with the opening of its first hotel, the 150 room The Park Hotel on 1 November 1967.. The park street name coinage is assumed to be having association with such a history. Location and importance Christmas on Park Street Christmas decorations, 2015 Night scene in Park Street Park Street originates from Chowringhee Road (J L Nehru Road) and connects to Park Circus 7 point crossing in a south eastern direction. The portion of Park Street between Chowringhee Road and Mullick Bazar has been one of the city's attractions for years. Several important roads originate from/intersect at Park Street in the northward and southward directions, namely Russell Street, Middleton Row, Camac Street, Wood Street, Loudon Street and Rawdon Street towards the South and Free School Street, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road towards the North. Park Street also intersects AJC Bose Road at Mullick Bazar crossing and eventually goes to Park Circus from where other major roads such as Syed Amir Ali Avenue, Darga Road, Park Circus Connector starts and connects to important areas such as Ballygunge, EM Bypass and CIT Road. Park Street remains Kolkata's foremost dining district, with many restaurants and pubs. It is often known as \\"Food Street\\" and \\"The Street that Never Sleeps\\". In the last 15 years, many new restaurants, shopping malls, 5-star hotels and nightclubs have opened in other areas of the city and hence Park Street has lost much of its earlier attraction as being the numero uno entertainment hub of Kolkata. However, it is still one of the prime commercial and entertainment zones of the city. Park Street is traditionally decorated with lights on Diwali, Christmas Day and New Year's Eve.

The Parable of the Lost Coin is one of the parables of Jesus. It appears in . In it, a woman searches for a lost coin, finds it, and rejoices. It is a member of a trilogy on redemption that Jesus tells after the Pharisees and religious leaders accuse Him of welcoming and eating with \\"sinners.\\"Richard N. Longenecker, The Challenge of Jesus' Parables, Eerdmans, 2000, , p. 201. The other two are the Parable of the Lost Sheep, and the Parable of the Lost Son or Prodigal Son.  Narrative  Drachma of the King of Persis Darius II, 1st century CE. As recounted in Luke 15, a woman with ten silver coins (Greek drachmae) loses one. She then lights an oil lamp and sweeps her house until she finds it, rejoicing when she does: On finding the lost coin, the woman shares her joy with her neighbors (etching by Jan Luyken).  Interpretation  Joel B. Green notes that \\"the woman described is a poor peasant, and the ten silver coins, corresponding to ten days' wages, \\"likely represent the family savings.\\"Joel B. Green, The Gospel of Luke, Eerdmans, 1997, , p. 576. The coins may also have been the woman's dowry, worn as an ornament.Ben Witherington, Women in the Ministry of Jesus: A study of Jesus' attitudes to women and their roles as reflected in his earthly life, Cambridge University Press, 1987, , p. 39.I. Howard Marshall, The Gospel of Luke: A commentary on the Greek text, Eerdmans, 1978, , p. 603. Both theories may be true, and either one explains the urgency of the woman's search, and the extent of her joy when the missing coin is found.\\" Like the Parable of the Ten Virgins, this is a parable about women which immediately follows, and makes the same point as, a preceding parable about men.The Parable of the Ten Virgins follows the Parable of the Faithful Servant, and this parable follows the Parable of the Lost Sheep. In Greek, the \\"friends and neighbors\\" are female.Mary Ann Beavis, The Lost Coin: Parables of women, work, and wisdom, Continuum, 2002, , p. 36. Green suggests that the invitation to the \\"friends and neighbors\\" may reflect a celebratory meal, which recalls the meals Jesus is accused of sharing with \\"sinners.\\" The woman's diligent activity in searching may symbolise either Jesus' own activity or that of God the Father. The rejoicing of the angels is understood to be rejoicing along with God.

May 17, 1895), a native of Switzerland, was a celebrated enologist, honored as a Chevalier of the Ordre National du M√©rite Agricole for his part in saving the French wine industry from the phylloxera root louse pest. Early life Jaeger, sixth of Charles and Mary (Custer) Jaeger's seven offspring, came from a well-known and highly educated family. His mother Mary's grandfather was Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, founder of the Swiss public school system. As a young man Jaeger took a job in a wine warehouse on Lake Geneva in Switzerland and then emigrated to the United States. In 1865, just after the end of the American Civil War, he settled east of Neosho, in the Monark Springs, Missouri area of Newton County. The following year he and his brother, John, planted a vineyard and became grape growers and wine makers. Marriages and Children In 1872, Jaeger married Eliza Wagenrieder of St. Louis, Missouri; his brother John had earlier married Eliza's sister Anna in 1866. Eliza died at the age of 19 on October 11, 1873 shortly after giving birth to a daughter, Bertha. In 1874, Jaeger married Elise Grosse (1854‚Äì1913), also of Saint Louis. Together, they had four children, Herman (1878‚Äì1923), Lena (born 1881), Emma (born 1884), and Carl (1892‚Äì1950). Viticulture Intelligent and proficient in several languages, Hermann Jaeger worked to breed over 100 new varieties of grapes, many of which came from wild Ozarks grapes - grapes commonly called \\"possum grapes\\". He also became the first grower in the Western world to spray vines to control fungal disease. He readily communicated with other grape experts around the world, sharing information about his work and learning from the works of others. He also wrote articles for scientific and grape journals, explaining the mysteries of grapes and his work on his farm. Work with phylloxera After the spectacular success of Missouri wines at the Vienna World Fair of 1851, taking 8 of the 12 medals on offer, the French responded by importing Norton / Cynthiana rootstocks from the US, and unwittingly introducing phylloxera, which then ravaged the vineyards of France, Spain, and Portugal during the 1870s. Jaeger, working with the Missouri state entomologist George Hussman, had already raised vines with resistance to the pest; he exported 17 boxcars of the resistant rootstock to France, which was to prove the salvation of the European wine industry. Parker, M. (2009). Legend of Hermann Jaeger. www.MissouriRuralist.com - April 2009. In 1893, for his contribution to the grape and wine industries of France, Jaeger was made Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur. Jaeger also made a lasting contribution to viticulture through his selection Jaeger 70, which is an ancestor of many of today's hybrid grapes. Business problems For all his success, Jaeger was to be beset by financial problems in the 1890s following the passing of a local law, many years ahead of Prohibition, banning the sale of alcohol in Newton County, Missouri. When his attempts at circumventing the law resulted in indictment, Jaeger sold his Neosho vineyard and moved to lands near Joplin, Missouri, where he intended growing fruit and starting a new vineyard. Death On 16 May 1895, Hermann Jaeger bade farewell to his wife and children, telling them he was returning to Neosho to address legal matters. He was never seen by his family again. Several days later, his wife received a letter from him postmarked Kansas City, 157 miles away. Written in German, the letter read 'When you read these lines, I will be alive no more' and making it clear his body would never be found. He signed the letter 'your unlucky Hermann'.

Biography Lars-Erik Vilner Larsson was born in √Ökarp in 1908, the son of a factory worker and a nurse. He studied with Ellberg at the Stockholm Conservatory (1925‚Äì1929) and with Alban Berg and Fritz Reuter in Vienna and Leipzig (1929‚Äì1930), then worked for Swedish Radio and taught at the Stockholm Conservatory (1947‚Äì1959) and Uppsala University where he held the position as Director musices (1961‚Äì1966). Composer Svea Nordblad Welander and her husband Waldemar Welander were among his students. His style as a composer is eclectic, ranging from the late Romantic to techniques derived from Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-note system, but original in method. He was the first Swede to write serial music (1932). Yet other works of that period are post-Sibelian or neo-classical, and his output generally is characterized by variety of style. He wrote for the theatre, cinema and broadcasting, in addition to the more traditional forms of symphony, concerto, chamber and vocal music. He died of diabetes complications in Helsingborg in 1986, aged 78. Works Larsson wrote two of the most popular works in Swedish art music: *Pastoral suite (Pastoralsvit), for chamber orchestra, Op. 19 (1938) *A God in Disguise (F√∂rkl√§dd gud), a non-religious lyrical suite for mixed chorus, soloists and orchestra, Op. 24 (1940; text written by Malm√∂ poet Hjalmar Gullberg) Larsson's most important symphonic works are his three symphonies for full orchestra: *Symphony No. 1 in D major, Op. 2 (1927‚Äì28) *Symphony No. 2, Op. 17 (1936‚Äì37) *Symphony No. 3 in C minor, Op. 34 (1944‚Äì45) Other works for orchestra: *A Winter's Tale (En Vintersaga), Op. 18 (1937‚Äì38) Larsson also wrote a Sinfonietta for string orchestra and a popular Little Serenade for the same medium. He wrote a series of 12 concertinos for solo instruments: flute, saxophone, clarinet, bassoon, oboe, horn, trumpet, trombone, violin, viola, cello, double bass and piano. Larsson's Concerto for alto saxophone, written for Sigurd Rasch√®r in 1934, is one of the first major works for saxophone to utilize ideas of non-standard tonality. The Violin Concerto, Op. 42 (1952) is another important work, as is the opera Prinsessan av Cypern.

Its central church is home to the Congregation of St. Athanasius, which dates from 1864 and is the oldest Episcopal Church in Southern California, and the oldest continuing Episcopal Church in Los Angeles. The congregation conducts services in English, Korean, and Spanish. The congregation is named for Athanasius, the 4th-century Bishop of Alexandria known for his ministry in a widely secular society. The Cathedral Center was built on the site of the old St. Athanasius church building. Frank M. Alton is Provost. Site and functions Located in the Echo Park district near downtown Los Angeles, the Cathedral Center houses community-outreach programs ranging from the Episcopal Community Federal Credit Union to the weekly food distribution program. Part of the Episcopal Church, the Cathedral Center also houses the offices of the bishops and Cathedral Center staff and regularly hosts retreats and other events for Episcopal-affiliated and community groups. The Cathedral Center was consecrated October 22, 1994, on its current site, 840 Echo Park Avenue, where Episcopal parish ministry has been conducted since 1917. Previous diocesan administrative buildings have included St. Paul's Cathedral, built in 1923 on Figueroa Street north of Wilshire Boulevard and demolished in 1980 after earthquake damage; St. Paul's Pro-Cathedral, built in 1883 on Olive Street and sold in 1922 to make way for the Biltmore Hotel; and the original 1865 St. Athanasius' Church, located on New High Street and Temple, just northeast of L.A.'s current City Hall. Current status In 2008, Bruno established \\"one cathedral ministry in two locations\\" upon designating St. John's Church, 514 W. Adams Boulevard in Los Angeles, as the Pro-Cathedral of the Diocese of Los Angeles. Built in 1925 and a city landmark, St. John's Pro-Cathedral serves the diocese as the site of larger liturgical gatherings. Both the Cathedral Center of St. Paul and the Pro- Cathedral of St. John have vibrant music ministries and feature distinctive pipe organs. An earlier instrument, the 1911 Murray Harris organ built for St. Paul's Pro-Cathedral, now serves St. James in-the-City Episcopal Church, 3903 Wilshire Boulevard.

The area is in proximity to the suburbs of Bukit Damansara, TTDI, Mont Kiara, Sri Hartamas and Bangsar. Bukit Kiara has often been described as one of the last remaining 'green lungs' of Kuala Lumpur, boasting many jungle trails, pristine rivers and streams and abundant native wildlife. Despite rapid housing and commercial development in neighbouring Mont Kiara, Bukit Kiara is still known as a natural oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Kuala Lumpur. Ongoing developments on several tracts of land in Bukit Kiara have met with protests from several non-governmental organisations (NGOs), citing the ongoing commitment from various government departments and ministers to have the park gazetted. The gazettement would ensure the remaining park would be protected from development for the foreseeable future. History In 1976, the government acquired the then 1,534-acre Bukit Kiara rubber estate from Ng Chin Siu & Sons Rubber Estates Ltd and other minority land owners for RM49.14 million. Subsequently, some 200 acres was marked public institutional land to house the National Institute of Public Administration (Intan), National Science Centre and the Securities Commission, among others. Minutes of government meetings obtained from the National Archives reveal the government later commissioned the services of US Landscape architects and planners Royston Hanamoto, Alley and Abey to lead a local team of professional firms and eminent individuals to prepare a ‚Äòbotanical garden‚Äô master plan for the remaining 1,300 acres. The master plan, completed in 1982, provided for the creation of an arboretum in the north merging southwards into a park-like National Mausoleum and an international-standard ‚Äòpublic‚Äô golf course bordering Jalan Damansara (now Kelab Golf Perkhidmatan Awam). While the plan remained intact until 1987, along the way, the development of private sector recreation clubs and high-end residential and mixed development projects violated the purpose of the government‚Äôs acquisition in 1976. Recreation Of the original 1,534 acre estate, only about 400 acres is left for public use. The rest has been sold off or acquired over the years by the likes of KL Golf and Country Club (KLGCC), Bukit Kiara Equestrian and Country Resort and various \\"mixed residential\\" projects all approved under suspect circumstances. In 2012, the National Landscape Department erected a 4m fence around one of the lots to demarcate the park and separate it from Berjaya Corporation‚Äôs Bukit Kiara Equestrian Club. This followed a High Court ruling declaring City Hall had entered into a lease agreement with the club over 62.57 acres (meant to be part of the large scale public park declared in 2007). However, the Housing and Local Government Ministry said the fencing was to deter illegal rubber tapping and to expedite the transformation of the park into a world- class arboretum. In 2013, the ministry said the large scale public park would comprise four parcels (of which the first lot is an amalgamation of three parcels). The government had then said it was still sorting out matters related to the two lots leased to Measat. Since 2013, then Segambut MP Lim Lip Eng raised a list of questions in Parliament regarding the delay of the gazettement. The replies given included gazettement could only be made once the Federal Lands and Mines Department had received all land titles from the Commissioner of Land. \\"Inside the fence\\" there is a small network of tarmac trails painted red and yellow and with poorly designed gutters that funnel the heavy rains into the middle of the road instead of into the drains. Off the tarmac in many directions are numerous mountain bike and walking trails that are maintained by dozens of local volunteers.

As constructed, luxe motor lengths range from though many were lengthened in the 1950s to compete with the falling price of road transport. After commercial retirement the luxe hull is a popular choice for liveaboard and recreational use and many have been shortened to aid with handling or attract reduced mooring fees. The luxe motor type rapidly supplanted the older aak and tjalk hull styles, offering straighter sides, a wider beam and lengths which exceeded the largest examples of the older hull styles, all of which contributed to a greater cargo capacity. In addition the \\"duck tail\\" transom, prop and rudder arrangement was better suited to diesel propulsion than the sail-optimised hulls of older types, though they do suffer from a pronounced \\"walk\\" effect when running aft. Typically they can carry through water, the hydrodynamics of the hull not being suited to higher speeds. In commercial use the hold was originally covered by duck boards, wooden panels which could be removed to expose the hold for loading. This would then be covered with a tarpaulin. In the postwar period many adopted steel hatches instead for speed and longevity. External links *Luxe motor pictures *J&J; Griffin: The Quick Reference Guide to Dutch Barges, UK, 2007.

Tension between the government and the Military had been simmering throughout the year, with Commodore Bainimarama and other Military officers making strongly worded public statements opposing certain government policies, including the early release from prison of persons implicated in the Fiji coup of 2000, and the government's promotion of controversial legislation to establish a Commission with the power to grant amnesty to perpetrators of the coup.  Military chief challenges government to dismiss him  Commodore Frank Bainimarama, Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, publicly challenged Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola and his Chief Executive Lesi Korovavala on 22 December to visit the Queen Elizabeth Barracks and dismiss him. The Commander declared that he would ignore any written dismissal; the minister and the chief executive would have to confront him in person. If the minister refused to follow his advice, he could run the Military on his own, he said. Bainimarama also stated his intention to commandeer Korovavala's office, and claimed to have ordered Army engineers to secure it. \\"I do not care where he will go to. All I know is that I will now be stationed in that office,\\" the Commander declared. The Commander also suggested that the government should consider dismissing Vosanibola, and that if the Minister failed to take his advice, removing him from office would be his next step.  Emergency meetings and mediation  On 28 December, Deputy Police Commissioner Moses Driver and Assistant Police Commissioner (Crime) Kevueli Bulamainaivalu said that Commissioner Andrew Hughes was monitoring the threats made against Korovavala. Anare Jale, meanwhile, told Fiji Village that the police would be asked to intervene if Commodore Bainimarama tried to remove Korovavala from office. That afternoon, Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola told Fiji Village that he had briefed Vice-President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi and Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale in the morning. The threats were being taken seriously, he said, and \\"appropriate action\\" would follow. Joji Kotobalavu, the Chief Executive Officer in the Prime Minister's Department, who chaired an emergency meeting of officials on the 28th, claimed that Vice-President Madraiwiwi had summoned Bainimarama during the afternoon, but Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni denied this. Also present at the meeting were Anare Jale, Solicitor-General Nainendra Nand, and the Acting CEO of Home Affairs, Saverio Baleikanacea. Leweni claimed that in seizing the office of the Home Affairs CEO, Bainimarama was merely appropriating an office that had originally been allocated to the Military, but which had not hitherto been occupied by them. The whole of the second floor of Government Buildings was supposed to be allocated to the Army, Leweni said. The Military was not concerned about the emergency meeting, Leweni said, as it would deal directly with the persons involved. Vosanibola was quoted on 29 December by the Fiji Times and Fiji Live that there was no cause for alarm, and that everything was under control. He had taken personal charge of the matter, he said. The commissioning of Judge Advocate Leung for the court martial retrial would be processed \\"soon\\", he promised. Fiji Live also reported that Vice-President Madraiwiwi would be meeting Commodore Bainimarama in the first week of January 2006 in an effort to defuse the tension. In a further development, Bainimarama declared on the last day 2005 that he would no longer recognize Josefa Vosanibola as the Minister in charge of the Military Forces. \\"The Military now is on its own and is not answerable to anyone\\", the Commander said. In convening the court martial retrial, the Military would now act unilaterally, he said. He repeated his challenge to the government to dismiss him. The Commander went on to say that much of the Qarase government's legislation was \\"racist\\", and that the government was tailoring its legislation to suit only a very few people, not the country as a whole. \\"I am the one who is standing for democracy and the rule of law because the Government and its officials only want the laws to be made to suit them\\", he said. Captain Leweni criticized Vosanibola on 3 January 2006 for involving the Office of the President in the dispute. \\"The RFMF will now ask the minister why they are going back to the very office they have disobeyed by not processing the appointment of the judge advocate made by the President\\", Leweni said.  No more coups  Bainimarama assured his senior officers, however, that he was not contemplating a coup, according to a statement from Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni quoted that day in the Fiji Sun. Rumours of a coup plot had been fabricated by certain government officials overreacting to the Commander's comments, in an attempt to discredit the Commander and the Military, which did not want a coup, Leweni said.  Calls for government to resign  In a fresh attack on 3 January 2006, Bainimarama called on the government to resign. The government had no intention, he said, of closing the events of 2000, and was continuing to promote racist legislation. \\"They have let people out of jail on one excuse or the other. How can they (the Government) sleep at night ‚Äì do they have a clear conscience?\\" He went on to call for its resignation. \\"This government is incompetent,\\" the Fiji Times quoted him as saying. \\"It's better that they resign so that better people can do the things that is supposed to bring us good.\\" Bainimarama's criticism of government decisions was not limited to legal issues. On 6 January, he condemned the earmarking of F$90,000 for the planned visit of American evangelist Benny Hinn, saying the money should have been given to the poor.  Arms shipment to police  The Fiji Sun reported on 8 January 2006 that the Military was monitoring a shipment of arms sent to the Fiji police force the previous week. Police spokesman Samuela Matakibau, Assistant Commissioner of Police Operation, confirmed the previous evening that a shipment had been received, insisting that the arms were merely replacements for old ones. Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni strongly criticized the shipment, and called on the government to reveal its motives for supplying the weapons to the police force. The arms had actually been purchased for Fijian soldiers serving in Iraq, Leweni claimed, before being diverted to the police, and the Military wanted an explanation. The concern of the Military was supported by Fiji Labour Party (FLP) parliamentarian Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi, and by Ema Druavesi, General Secretary of the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT). Vayeshnoi called for an investigation into what he said was a misuse of funds, involving the diversion of arms bought for the Military to the police. Druavesi blamed Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola for the diversion of the shipment, and questioned the government's motives in arming the police. \\"Is the government relying on the police to be used in a confrontational between the two security forces? Blood of Fijians is going to flow if there is a confrontation,\\" she declared. She called on the police to return the weapons to the Military. Lieutenant Saula Tuikoro, a former Fiji Intelligence Service agent, told the Fiji Sun on 8 January that the diversion of the shipment was a sinister move on the part of the government to counter the Army. The weapons were more modern and of superior quality to those possessed by the Military, Tuikoro said. He saw this as a threat to national security. \\"(The) government is now equipping the police to take on the army,\\" he claimed. Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes defended the shipment on 9 January. The Fiji Village news service reported him as saying that the weapons had been purchased from the police budget and were low-power weapons, unsuitable for military use. They would be used only in life- threatening emergencies by officers from the Police Tactical Response Unit, a new mobile police team based in Nasinu, Hughes said. The issue flared up again in March. On the 15th, Fiji Live quoted Leweni as accusing the police of purchasing F$1.5 million worth of weapons from South Korea. The shipment allegedly included 123 pistols, 30 submachine guns, and assorted warfare equipment. He also charged Commissioner Hughes with complicity in the deal, which he said had been masterminded by the Australian Defence Review Team as part of a package to reduce the size of the Military and transfer most of its duties to the police. Hughes was deliberately arming Fijians against Fijians, he said. Commodore Bainimarama went further: the shipment had been intended for the Military, he claimed, and had been diverted to the police by the government. Hughes expressed surprise at the strong language, and said that the Military was mistaken. The arms had been purchased as per the government's budget allocation to the police, he claimed, for the purpose of countering \\"armed criminals\\" such as terrorists. He was also disappointed that the Military had spoken to the media rather than to him directly, he said. Hughes and Bainimarama met on the 16th and agreed afterwards that the disagreement had been due to a misunderstanding. Hughes accepted some responsibility for having failed to explain the details of the shipment and its purpose sooner. This had been unintentional, he insisted.  Threat to remove government  In another apparent escalation of the dispute, the Military released a statement on 9 January 2006, to be published in newspapers the following day, threatening to take control of the country if the government failed to \\"continue the good fight\\". It was the military that had entrusted the present government with restoring order and rebuilding the nation in 2000, the statement said, but instead it was continuously promoting \\"racist\\" policies and programmes to justify its existence to the indigenous community. The statement came in response to comments made by Acting Foreign Minister Pita Nacuva in a newspaper interview, claiming that the attitude of the Military was merely a sour grapes. \\"It is obvious from Nacuva's comments that the Government makes light of the sour relationship between the Government and the army in past years. The Government would be very na√Øve to underestimate the intention of the military in this instance,\\" the statement tersely said. Commodore Bainimarama, for his part, declared that if the government's \\"racist\\" policies continued, the Military would not hesitate take control of the country. \\"To the government the military says this is no petty issue. You have the choice to make it right for the nation,\\" the Fiji Live news service quoted him as saying. The death of soldiers in 2000 had yet to be avenged, he said, and the policies of the government prevented the \\"dark days of 2000\\" from being erased. He said that political decisions smacked of \\"a bulling government, lacking in character.\\" On 11 January, Bainimarama denied a report that he had met secretly with Vice-President Madraiwiwi. He told the Fiji Live news service that the report, published earlier in the Fiji Sun, was not correct, and that he was still waiting for a meeting to be scheduled. On the afternoon of the 12th, however, he told the Fiji Village news service that the meeting had in fact taken place, but said he was not in a position to reveal what had been discussed.  Reactions to the crisis  * See main article: Reaction to the 2005‚Äì06 Fijian political crisis. Both before and after the crisis was resolved on 16 January with a truce brokered by Acting President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi, the crisis generated a great deal of comment, both locally and internationally. The faultline between indigenous and Indo- Fijians, which has defined Fijian politics for the last generation, was much less evident in this event. The main players on both sides were ethnic Fijians. Indo-Fijian-led parties appeared divided in their response, with the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) coming close to endorsing a military coup and its chief rival for the Indo-Fijian vote, the National Federation Party condemning it.  The Baledrokadroka incident  Commodore Bainimarama dismissed Lieutenant Colonel Jone Baledrokadroka, the Acting Land Force Commander and effectively the second most senior officer in the Military, on 13 January, alleging insubordination. He subsequently accused Baledrokadroka of plotting a mutiny with \\"outside\\" encouragement, implicating the government, and of threatening to shoot him. Baledrokadroka said the allegations were \\"lies\\". The confrontation had come about, Baledrokadroka claimed, when Bainimarama had issued him with a \\"treasonous\\" order, which he had refused to obey, and accused the Commander of plotting a coup.  Suva calm, but ...  Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes announced that police officers were resuming \\"normal duties,\\" following a personal assurance from Commodore Bainimarama that there was no threat to national security. The national security alert had been unnecessary and the rumours sweeping the nation had been \\"media generated,\\" he considered. He also denied rumours that weapons recently purchased by the police were to counter the Military should the need arise. \\"They are not in any sense part of a program initiated by government by me or by anybody else to equip the police to somehow ... counter any military threat,\\" he insisted. \\"There is no way the police are gearing up to take on that role.\\" Pending a meeting scheduled for 16 January between the Prime Minister and Military Commander, convened by Vice-President Madraiwiwi, The Sunday Star-Times in New Zealand anonymously quoted what it claimed was a senior indigenous Fijian politician under investigation for coup-related offences, as saying that any effort to dismiss Bainimarama could lead to \\"a bloodbath\\". The Sunday Star-Times quoted him as expressing doubts that it would come to that, however, because the Commander knew too much. He did not elaborate. The Sunday Star-Times also noted that unlike previous crises, which were, or were widely seen to be, between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the latter were largely absent from the latest conspiracies.  Conspiracy theories, complaints, and investigations  In the aftermath of the crisis, a number of conspiracy theories have been advanced, some of which have sparked investigations and legal proceedings.  Josateki Koroi's allegations  Fiji Labour Party President Jokapeci Koroi issued a statement on 14 January 2006 accusing Lesi Korovavala, the Chief Executive Officer of the Home Affairs Ministry, of having conspired with Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola to arrange a secret meeting between Baledrokadroka and Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, in an attempt to depose Bainimarama. This was Koroi's second controversial statement in less than a week, having said on Fiji Television on the 11th that the FLP would support a military coup. Qarase angrily denied the allegations against him and the two public servants on the 15th, challenged Koroi to substantiate them, and said that he had filed charges against her for inciting violence, rebellion, and instability. \\"This is an outrageous allegation and everything that she is talking about is an absolute lie,\\" the Fiji Sun quoted him as saying of Koroi's allegations. He was not mollified by a later statement by the FLP that her remarks had been taken \\"out of context.\\" \\"Television pictures do not lie,\\" Qarase said. He was still indignant on the 18th, condemning FLP leader Mahendra Chaudhry for trying to divert attention from Koroi's statement. Wild allegations were a \\"hallmark\\" of the FLP, Qarase claimed. He announced that a complaint had been laid with the police. The same day, however, Commodore Bainimarama, however, supported the FLP's claims. At a press conference, he alleged that the Military had tapped a telephone conversation in which Baledrokadroka was asked to elicit support from senior officers for the removal of Bainimarama. Powerful people were trying to remove him, he claimed, in order to derail his work to prosecute perpetrators of the 2000 coup. Meanwhile, police spokeswoman Sylvia Low had confirmed the day before that a complaint had been received from the Military, calling for an investigation into possible collusion between Baledrokadroka and government officials over an alleged attempt to incite a mutiny. On 20 January, Low told the Fiji Times that two complaints had been received concerning Jokapeci Koroi, one from Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola concerning her public endorsement of a potential Military coup, and the other from Lesi Korovavala, Chief Executive Officer of the Home Affairs Ministry, concerning allegations she had made about his alleged role in an alleged army mutiny on 12 January. The Fiji Sun quoted Regional Development Minister Ted Young on 21 February as saying that Koroi's endorsement of a possible coup had resulted in a major downturn in the tourism industry.  Poseci Bune's meeting with Bainimarama  It was confirmed by the Military on 17 January that Poseci Bune, the Deputy Leader of the Fiji Labour Party (FLP), had met with Bainimarama at Suva the Queen Elizabeth Barracks on the 15th, a day before Bainimarama's crucial meeting with the Prime Minister at Government House. Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni strongly denied claims that Bune's visit had been to influence the Commander to continue with his anti-government campaign. The meeting had been above-board, Leweni said. Bune clarified that his meeting with the Commander had not been as a representative of the FLP.  Bainimarama clarifies  The Fiji Times printed a statement from Commodore Bainimarama on 16 January, the same morning that he was meeting the Prime Minister with Acting President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi as mediator, insisting that there was nothing political about his antigovernment pronouncements. He had never commented except when he believed that government policies were undermining national security, he claimed. \\"I really don't have any business in the political running of government. My outbursts are not political. It's about national security,\\" he told the Fiji Times. \\"Security to me and the RFMF means a clean and corrupt-free country,\\" he added. He said that his public attacks on government policies had begun when the government had started interfering with the judicial process. A unilateral government decision in 2003 to commute the sentences of soldiers involved in the Labasa mutiny that took place while the coup was in progress, had been taken without consulting the Military, he claimed.  The Government House truce  At a two-hour meeting at Government House, the official residence of the President, that ended around noon on 16 January, Acting President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi succeeded in brokering a truce between the Prime Minister and the Military Commander. The two men arrived separately, Prime Minister Qarase five minutes ahead of schedule and Bainimarama twelve minutes late. A statement issued by Madraiwiwi said that following a frank discussion, both men had agreed to put the \\"national interest\\" first. Commodore Bainimarama had agreed to consult the Ministry of Home Affairs before making any further statements to the media. Prime Minister Qarase, in turn, had promised not to interfere with police investigations into alleged accomplices of the 2000 coup perpetrators, and had agreed to \\"address\\" the Military's concerns over controversial legislation, including the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill. The Military Commander and the Police Commissioner would both be allowed to attend meetings often National Security Council as Observers. \\"Both recognised the need to put the national interest first. In the light of that consideration, the Prime Minister has agreed that the Commander and the Commissioner of Police be invited to participate in the Security Council as observers,\\" the Acting President said. On 18 January, however, the Prime Minister clarified that the Commander and the Commissioner would attend Security Council meetings only by invitation, and only when deemed necessary. In addition, it was agreed that the Prime Minister would from now on deal directly with the two officers, rather than through subordinate ministers or civil servants. He would meet regularly with the Commander to discuss matters of mutual concern, he said. \\"These meetings will create a new avenue for dialogue between the Government and the military rather than discussions in the media,\\" Prime Minister Qarase told the Fiji Live news service. The Prime Minister also revealed on 17 January that he had promised the Commander that the upcoming general election would be conducted independently, without government interference. Madraiwiwi called on both parties to be cautious and responsible in their dealings with each other. \\"It is critical that elements in the Government and the military exercise circumspection and discretion in their dealings with each other at all times,\\" he said. The meeting had also reestablished normal channels of communication between the government and the Military, Madraiwiwi said. He thanked both men for the way in which the meeting had been conducted. On 20 January, Bainimarama attempted to clarify his view of the agreement on Fiji Television. His agreement not to talk to the media was conditional, he said, on being allowed to make representations to the government. If the government failed to address his concerns, he was not precluded from commenting publicly, he considered. He made the remarks with respect to his complaint against Lesi Korovavala, Chief Executive Officer of the Public Service Commission, whom the Military wants removed. It was revealed on 26 January that the meeting had been tape recorded at the request of Commodore Bainimarama, with the approval of Acting President Madraiwiwi. The tape is now the property of the Military, according to Fiji Television, and is now being studied by senior Military officers.  Aftermath  The aftermath of the crisis had repercussions for both the Military and the government.  Investigation undertaken  Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni said on 17 January that the Military was undertaking a review to improve its intelligence services. A Board of Inquiry had also been set up to investigate officers accused of having sided with Baledrokadroka in the alleged mutiny, he revealed. Baledrokadroka himself was expected to be called as a witness, he revealed. The same day, Commodore Bainimarama strongly denied allegations made by Baledrokadroka that he had been planning a coup. According to the Fiji Times, he denied that there was by connection between his own media statements and the expected retirement in March of President Ratu Josefa Iloilo or the absence from the country of parliamentary Speaker, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, himself a former Military commander. Nailatikau's visit to Fijian troops serving as peacekeepers in Iraq was at his own request and had been approved by the Home Affairs Ministry, he said; the Military had nothing to do with it. Likewise, the expected Presidential election was the prerogative of the Great Council of Chiefs, he said; it was nothing to do with the Military. Bainimarama also claimed to have been aware of Baledrokadroka's ambition to hold the position of Commander, and to have monitored him for five weeks before dismissing him. Leweni announced on 20 January that four senior army officers had been appointed the day before to investigate the alleged mutiny plot. The four officers would not be named until they had completed their work, Leweni said.  PSC investigates complaint against Korovavala  The Public Service Commission (PSC) chairman Stuart Huggett revealed to the Fiji Times on 19 January that they had received a formal complaint from Commodore Bainimarama about Lesi Korovavala, the Chief Executive Officer of the Home Affairs Ministry. Bainimarama accused Korovavala of having instigated an alleged threat of mutiny by Lieutenant Colonel Jone Baledrokadroka, the then-Acting Land Force Commander. Earlier, Bainimarama had claimed evidence of a telephone conversation between Baledrokadroka and somebody from outside the camp; the Fiji Times implied this to be Korovavala. The Fiji Village news service, meanwhile, reported that the Military had gathered information that Baledrokadroka had met with Korovavala on a number of occasions. Korovavala told Fiji Village that the allegations were false, and had been referred to the police. Huggett also confirmed that the PSC had received a letter from Korovavala denying the allegations. Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni said that nothing short of Korovavala's removal would satisfy the Military. This had been a key Military demand before the accord brokered by Vice-President Madraiwiwi on 16 January, and quickly surfaced again. Radio Gold reported on the 17th that Bainimarama had raised the issue at the meeting with Madraiwiwi and Qarase, accusing Korovavala of having caused the friction between the government and the Military. Accordintg to Radio Gold, Bainimarama had told them that he suspected that Korovavala had telephoned Baledrokadroka to arrange a meeting with the Prime Minister, and that he had evidence to support his claim. Jioji Kotobalavu, the Chief Executive Officer of the Prime Minister's Department, claimed that the Prime Minister was not responsible for the contracts of chief executives and could not interfere. Meanwhile, Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola told Fiji Television that he, too, had received a copy of Bainimarama's letter. Korovavala had written to the PSC to deny the charges, he said. Lawyer Isireli Fa said that Korovavala had asked his firm to study the matter and to protect his interests. Huggett revealed on 20 January that the previous day's meeting of the PSC had decided to appoint an independent team to investigate Bainimarama's complaint against Korovavala. The team would try to deal with the complaints within three months, Huggett told the Fiji Times.  New tensions  Strains in the accord began to surface almost immediately. Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes confirmed on 25 January that police were looking into an official complaint from Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola, concerning Commodore Bainimarama's threat on 8 January to depose the government. Police Media Relations Officer Sylvia Low said that police were investigating to determine whether the treat was seditious or treasonous. Vosanibola also questioned the integrity of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, asking why it was taking so long to investigate the threatening telephone calls made to several Ministers and senior civil servants in April 2005. Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni said that the Military had not been informed of the complaint, and was trying to ascertain its basis. Bainimarama reacted angrily to the revelation, accusing the government of breaching the accord brokered by Acting President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi on the 16th. He announced his intention to respond on the 27th, warning that the Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister \\"had better be ready.\\" The Fiji Times reported that Prime Minister Qarase had refused to answer questions pertaining to the latest disagreement, and had switched off his cellphone when contacted. Later, however, he told the Fiji Village news service that he would personally investigate Vosanibola's actions, to prevent any recurrence of the long-running impasse between the government and Military. On 27 January, Vosanibola made any withdrawal of his complaint conditional on an apology from Bainimarama. This provoked an angry response from the Commander on the 29th. He called for Vosanibola, whom he described as \\"beyond help,\\" to be dismissed and charged. The demand that he apologize for his threats against the government was ridiculous, he said. \\"Asking me to apologise for making that statement is an insult to the working people of this nation because, simply, it is my job,\\" the Fiji Live news service quoted him as saying. He defined the role of the Military as ensuring security and the well-being of the people of Fiji, which he accused \\"people like Vosanibola\\" of failing to do. The Commander's latest statement came notwithstanding the Government House agreement not to speak to the media without consulting the Military. \\"No one is going to attack the military without any retaliation from the military ‚Äì not even under any agreement,\\" he defiantly declared.  Commander withdraws from talks  Bainimarama announced on 27 February that on the advice of his senior officers, he had decided to discontinue his fortnightly meetings with the Prime Minister, saying that no progress had been made and that the talks were therefore pointless. From now on, any Cabinet Minister ‚Äì including the Prime Minister ‚Äì who wished to see him would have to visit the Queen Elizabeth Barracks headquarters, he told Fiji Village. Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Orisi Rabukawaqa said that the government had failed to grant soldiers' ration allowances or job evaluation exercises, despite the budget allocation, and raising the matter with the Prime Minister had proved futile. Rabukawaqa said that after his weekly meetings with Acting President Madraiwiwi and his fortnightly meetings with Prime Minister Qarase, he would write to both men about issues he wanted addressed. Madraiwiwi replied to the letters, he said; Qarase did not. \\"We feel that he was just making a fool of us and we have advised the commander not to hold any more meetings with him,\\" Rabukawaqa said. Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola responded by saying that Rabukawaqa's comments were not justified, and that concerns that had been raised were being looked into. The Fiji Sun quoted the Prime Minister (6 March) as saying that Bainimarama's decision to withdraw from the talks was \\"unfortunate.\\" Progress had been made during the course of the discussions, he claimed. What really went wrong was that he expected me and my Government to follow orders. In other words, to do everything he wanted,\\" he later claimed.  Renewed warnings from Australia, New Zealand  Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer reiterated earlier warnings to Bainimarama on 24 February 2006, saying that the passage of legislation was not up to the Military. \\"People can have whatever opinions they like on the laws but in the end the parliament should make those laws not the military,\\" the Sydney Morning Herald quoted him as saying. Supported by his New Zealand counterpart, Winston Peters, he warned that another coup would be devastating, not only for the Fijian economy but also for its international relationships. The Military responded by asking Downer to stay out of Fijian politics, saying that Australians could not know what it was like to live through a coup. Fiji's Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola added that the Military had no authority to interfere with government business. The Commander's stated intention to withdraw from meeting the Prime Minister was disrespectful to the highest office in the land, he told Fiji Live. The Fijian Military responded on the 28th, saying that the safety and security of Fiji were the business of the Military. Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Orisi Rabukawaqa was quoted in the Fiji Times as saying that the views expressed by the Australian and New Zealand foreign ministers were disrespectful and irresponsible. He claimed that the security of the nation and its citizens was constitutionally entrusted to the Military, a claim that Vosanibola had disputed. Fiji Live reported on 1 March that the Military had called on Prime Minister Qarase to discipline Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola. Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni accused Vosanibola of deliberately failing to understand the constitutional prerogatives of the Military. According to Leweni, the 1997 Constitution affirmed the role given to the Military in the 1990 constitution. \\"If Vosanibola cannot understand simple English than he is not worthy to continue in his cabinet portfolio,\\" he said. He accused Vosanibola of committing three serious acts of insubordination since 1983, the most serious, he said, in 2005 when he allegedly tried to thwart President Ratu Josefa Iloilo's decision to appoint Graeme Leung as Judge Advocate of the court martial retrial of former soldiers convicted of their roles in the mutiny that took place at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks on 2 November 2005. Commodore Bainimarama concurred with Leweni. He told Fiji Live that Vosanibola was incompetent and unfit to hold office. \\"This kind of incompetent people should not be voted in,\\" he said. \\"We should vote for only competent people.\\" In an interview with ABC Television reported by Fiji Live on 3 March, Downer reiterated his earlier opposition to Military interference in politics.  Great Council of Chiefs asks President, Vice-President to intervene again  Fiji Live reported on 9 March that the Great Council of Chiefs had expressed concern at the strained relationship between the Prime Minister and the Military Commander, and had criticized the latter for his disregard for the government. They asked both President Ratu Josefa Iloilo and Vice-President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi to mediate.  Truth campaign  On 10 March, Bainimarama announced that the Military was about to embark on a campaign to educate the population about the \\"lies\\" being spread by the \\"opportunists\\" in the government. \\"We will go into villages and tell them the real truth of what happened and what is being done ... I will advise the people because they cannot continue to advise a government that continues to make it okay for those that went to jail to get back into society,\\" he told the Fiji Sun. \\"By not educating the people about doing what is right, it is willfully lying and misleading them.\\" His proposed campaign was endorsed by Poseci Bune, Deputy Leader of the Fiji Labour Party, but condemned by Ropate Sivo, General Secretary of the Conservative Alliance (whose dissolution he is resisting), and by Saula Telawa, President of the New Nationalist Party. The Sun quoted Sivo again on the 12th, calling for Bainimarama's arrest, saying that the Commander himself had a case to answer for his own role in the events of 2000. He accused Bainimarama of fomenting instability and of discouraging foreign investment. Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola said on 12 March that he was losing patience with the failure of the President and Vice-President to discipline the Commander. \\"I respect Government House but the time has come for them to act,\\" the Fiji Times quoted him as saying. \\"Why has Government House been sitting on this?\\" SDL campaign director Jale Baba said that the Military's proposed actions were illegal, and inconsistent with historical reality. He claimed that the policies of the Qarase government were identical to those pursued by the Military when it appointed Qarase as Prime Minister in the first place. Former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, despite his support for certain government policies opposed by the Military, endorsed the Military's campaign on 12 March, according to Fiji Village. Rabuka, himself a former Commander of the Army, said that the proposed actions of the Military were constitutional.  New moves  News remained quiet through the middle of 2006 until, in a speech at Ratu Latianara Secondary School, Commodore Bainimarama attacked government policies, which he said were creating a culture of lawlessness in Fiji. In the weeks that followed, he continually threatened to remove the government if it failed to implement his demands. The crisis came to a head when, on 26 November, Bainimarama called up 1,000 reserve troops to the Fijian Army, and reiterated his intention to topple the Fijian Government, during a private trip to New Zealand. This came shortly after police revealed that he would shortly be charged with sedition.

It was written and produced by Utada, with co-production by her father Teruzane Utada. The track was inspired by her relationship with her husband at the time, Kazuaki Kiriya. Its themes include sexism and understanding each other from a different perspective. \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\" premiered on January 1, 2005 as the fourth and final single from the album. Self-described as an electronic and dance-pop song, it contains numerous elements including J-pop and techno. Upon its release, \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\" garnered positive reviews from music critics. Many critics commended the song's composition, lyrical content, and Hikaru's vocal and production delivery. Minor criticism was directed towards the song's production. Despite being released promotionally in North America and Japan, it failed to place on any of their record charts. Released in the United Kingdom, it failed to reach inside the top 100, peaking at number 277. \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\" is her only song to chart in the UK. The accompanying music video for \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\" was shot in Tokyo by K≈çji Morimoto and Kiriya; it features an android-Utada inside of an industrial-cyber utopia. Inter-cut scenes feature daily life functions, emphasizing a differentiation of human and synthetic being. The video received positive reviews for its message and visuals. For additional promotion, the song was included on the track list of her concert tours Utada United 2006, and Utada: In the Flesh 2010. Background and composition \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\" was inspired by her relationship with her husband at the time, Kazuaki Kiriya. In a press conference for Utada's album Exodus, she stated, \\"I was trying to deal with my husband, and it was the first time I really came face to face with another human being, and the things that we couldn't understand about each other, or things we argued about, I felt like it was because (that) some of it was just like a sex issue...\\" \\"I felt like if I could be a man, I could understand him more, in some ways, so I wanted to understand him, and I thought, 'I wish I were a man!'\\". In an interview with Female First UK, she further elaborated \\"it's all about wanting to become another person and see it from another point of view.\\" The song was selected as the fourth and final single from Exodus, the lead single for the UK editions, and was released on October 17, 2005 by Island Def Jam and Mercury. The Maxi CD version of the single contains three remixes of \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\", and the accompanying music video. A bonus promo package included a separate CD and DVD of the single, and featured unreleased artwork of Exodus. A 12 inch vinyl was issued in the UK, featuring three remixes and the radio edit of the track. \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\" was written, composed, arranged, and produced by Utada, alongside co- production by her father Teruzane Utada. Utada described the song as \\"very electro\\" and \\"dance-pop\\" with numerous musical elements including J-pop and techno. Lucas Villa from Axs.com deciphered the themes of the track: \\"Tougher subjects Utada tackled on Exodus included her dissolving marriage to Kazuaki Kiriya on 'You Make Me Want to Be a Man.' She turned her frustrations about gender roles in a relationship into a feminist message, singing, 'I really want to tell you something but I can't / You make me want to be a man.' Several critic publications, including Renowned for Sound, #PopHatesFlops, and MuuMuse, quoted similar aspects of her relationship and feminism views as key themes to the song. Reception=Critical response \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\" received favourable reviews from most music critics. David Jeffries from AllMusic wrote the extended biography to Utada, and highlighted the track as an album and career standout moment in Utada's discography.Ridwin Khan from Animefringe.com said that \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\" has an \\"interesting hook and an energetic beat.\\" Bradley Stern from MuuMuse was positive in his review, labelling it a \\"futuristic J-pop-infused creation\\". Lucas Villa from Axs.com commended Utada's lyrical and vocal delivery, saying that the lyrics \\"got her point across on the battle-born dance track.\\" A reviewer from CD Journal gave the song a mixed review, complimenting Utada's song writing for portraying \\"real intentions\\" and praising the song's \\"fluctuation\\" of composition but also criticizing the song's production for its continuous looping. Music video=Background The accompanying music video for \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\" was directed by anime director K≈çji Morimoto and Kiriya. Utada stated that because the song itself featured electro and dance genres, \\"it fits well with visuals. I have a lot of electronic elements with machines and stuff like that.\\" Utada said she was influenced by her Japanese heritage, anime and otaku culture, and Japan's advances in technology during the early 2000s. She commented, \\"We wanted to play with the Japanese side of my existence. Japan is well know [sic] for these kinds of technological things, like Anime and the futuristic things, so I think that is what started off the whole thing.\\" Utada revealed that she shared her creative input with Kiriya because \\"It's very difficult, but a bit of companionship was exactly what I needed. With most of my work I mostly just say yes or no, so I guess what I needed was someone that I could trust the taste and opinions of and have the guts to tell me about things. Somebody that I could trust with the creative side of things a little more, so that is when he came into the picture.\\" Synopsis and reception Utada (pictured) with red eyes, witnessing and absorbing information of human life. The visuals and scenery were critically acclaimed by critics and publications. The video opens with Utada's and the song's name superimposed on a CGI city, progressing with different views of it. Throughout the video, several inter-cuts of archive footage feature heavy use of modern technology and small scenes of human functionality. The first chorus features a robotic Utada lying down, with several pieces of machinery and cords impaling her. As she sings, she witnesses small screens of daily life, allowing her to absorb human functions and information through artificial life. Throughout he choruses, the human Utada is shown singing with her band. As several inter-cuts of archive footage appear, the verses open with another robotic Utada witnessing the small screens with red eyes. By the second chorus, the robotic Utada is lifted into a container for further improvement. By the second verse, a robotic male companion emerges from a mercury-like substance, and is seen on a rooftop, displaying himself and the cityscape. The male snaps off a piece of his rib cage and puts it in front of him. Several cords and pieces of machinery interact with the bone, and form a mysterious light. The light then turns into a final form of the robotic Utada, covered in shiny gloss and with red eyes. The video ends with Utada on a seat, wired with machinery and cords. The video premiered on October 19, 2005 on UK MTV and Japanese music television channels, and premiered a week later worldwide. It received positive reviews from most music critics. Tamar Anitai from MTV discussed how the video related to the original MTV reality television series Made but failed to express gender reassignment. Anitai commented, \\"But the one amazing transformation we‚Äôve never seen on Made? Gender reassignment! Come on, Made! There's gotta be some girl out there who doesn't want to wear a bra anymore! And, believe it or not, we dug around in the MTV video vault and found a video buried in the WTF File that perfect embraces this sentiment: it's Japanese pop star Utada's clip, earnestly entitled, 'You Make Me Want to Be a Man.' Live performances and other appearances \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\" has been included in numerous tours conducted by Utada, such as her Utada United 2006 tour and her Utada: In the Flesh 2010 concert tour. \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\" was included on Utada's 2010 greatest hits album, Utada the Best.

A typical outline of the medical education pathway is presented below; however, medicine is a diverse profession with many options available. For example, some physicians work in pharmaceutical research, occupational medicine (within a company), public health medicine (working for the general health of a population in an area), or join the armed forces. Medical school In the United States a medical school is an institution with the purpose of educating medical students in the field of medicine. Admission into medical school may not technically require completion of a previous degree; however, applicants are usually required to complete at least 3 years of \\"pre- med\\" courses at the university level because in the US medical degrees are classified as Second entry degrees. Once enrolled in a medical school the four years progressive study is divided into two roughly equal components: pre- clinical (consisting of didactic courses in the basic sciences) and clinical (clerkships consisting of rotations through different wards of a teaching hospital). The degree granted at the conclusion of these four years of study is Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or, less commonly, Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) depending on the medical school; both degrees allow the holder to practice medicine after completing an accredited residency program. Internship During the last year of graduate medical education, students apply for postgraduate residencies in their chosen field of specialization. These vary in competitiveness depending upon the desirability of the specialty, prestige of the program, and the number of applicants relative to the number of available positions. All but a few positions are granted via a national computer match which pairs an applicant's preference with the programs' preference for applicants. Historically, post-graduate medical education began with a free-standing, one-year internship. Completion of this year continues to be the minimum training requirement for obtaining a general license to practice medicine in most states. However, because of the gradual lengthening of post-graduate medical education, and the decline of its use as the terminal stage in training, most new physicians complete the internship requirement as their first year of residency. Not with standing the trend toward internships integrated into categorical residencies, the one-year \\"traditional rotating internship\\" (sometimes called a \\"transitional year\\") continues to exist. Some residency training programs, such as in neurology and ophthalmology, do not include an internship year and begin after completion of an internship or transitional year. Some use it to re-apply to programs into which they were not accepted, while others use it as a year to decide upon a specialty. In addition, osteopathic physicians \\"are required to have completed an American Osteopathic Association (AOA)-approved first year of training in order to be licensed in Florida, Michigan, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania.\\"DO- Online.org  Postdoctoral Training  FAQS, Residency Each of the specialties in medicine has established its own curriculum, which defines the length and content of residency training necessary to practice in that specialty. Programs range from 3 years after medical school for internal medicine and pediatrics, to 5 years for general surgery, to 7 years for neurosurgery. Each specialty training program either incorporates an internship year to satisfy the requirements of state licensure, or stipulates that an internship year be completed before starting the program at the second post-graduate year (PGY-2). Fellowship A fellowship is a formal, full-time training program that focuses on a particular area within the specialty, with requirements beyond the related residency. Many highly specialized fields require formal training beyond residency. Examples of these include cardiology, endocrinology, oncology after internal medicine; cardiothoracic anesthesiology after anesthesiology; cardiothoracic surgery, pediatric surgery, surgical oncology after general surgery; reproductive endocrinology/infertility, maternal-fetal medicine, gynecologic oncology after obstetrics/gynecology. There are many others for each field of study. In some specialties such as pathology and radiology, a majority of graduating residents go on to further their training. The training programs for these fields are known as fellowships and their participants are fellows, to denote that they already have completed a residency and are board eligible or board certified in their basic specialty. Fellowships range in length from one to three years and are granted by application to the individual program or sub- specialty organizing board. Fellowships often contain a research component. Board certification The physician or surgeon who has completed his or her residency and possibly fellowship training and is in the practice of his or her specialty is known as an attending physician. Physicians then must pass written and oral exams in their specialty in order to become board certified. Each of the 26 medical specialties has different requirements for practitioners to undertake continuing medical education activities.  Continuing Medical Education  Continuing medical education (CME) refers to educational activities designed for practicing physicians. Many states require physicians to earn a certain amount of CME credit in order to maintain their licenses. Physicians can receive CME credit from a variety of activities, including attending live events, publishing peer-reviewed articles, and completing online courses. The Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) determines what activities are eligible for CME.

Werner Icking The mathematician and computer scientist Werner Icking (25 June 1943‚Äì8 February 2001) spent a large part of his career at the Gesellschaft f√ºr Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung, a national research centre for applied mathematics and computer science in Sankt Augustin, Germany. (The GMD was later absorbed into the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.) He not only played a key role in the development and distribution of MusiXTeX software, but also produced new editions of music by baroque composers, most notably the complete Urtext editions of Bach's works for solo violin and cello.Cataldi, Luigi, Stampa musicale con PMX, Werner Icking Music Archive, 2003, p. 18.

The street is named for Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, who is also the namesake of Broward County. Route description Downtown Fort Lauderdale looking over State Road 842 (Broward Boulevard) Broward Boulevard begins as CR 842 at Commedore Drive in Plantation, a short connector road which connects to the westbound lanes of SR 84, which is the service road for Interstate 595 (I-595). At University Drive (SR 817) where Westfield Broward and Plantation Walk are located, SR 842 begins. This intersection also has one of the few CR 842 shields, visible to motorists traveling southbound on University Drive. Just east of SR 817, Broward Boulevard passes by more commercial areas to the north, with Plantation Preserve Golf Course and Club to the south. East of NW 69th Avenue, the road becomes divided, and more residential as it enters Fort Lauderdale, passing under Florida's Turnpike without an interchange. East of the turnpike, it passes by the Fort Lauderdale Country Club to the south. As it approaches US 441, the road becomes more commercial again at the intersection and east of the intersection, continuing east. It continues through, with residential buildings about a block away from the commercial establishments, and crosses Interstate 95 and Tri-Rail and Amtrak Fort Lauderdale Station as SR 842 enters downtown Fort Lauderdale. In the downtown area, government buildings and banks line State Road 842. At SW 7th Avenue, it provides access to the Broward Center for the Performing Arts and at SW 5th Avenue, provides access to the Museum of Discovery and Science. The Broward County Transit central bus terminal is on the corner of SR 842 and Northwest First Avenue. The intersection with Andrews Avenue (unsigned County Road 811A) is the center of Fort Lauderdale's street grid. One block east is Federal Highway (US 1/SR 5), the eastern terminus of SR 842, while Broward Boulevard continues eastward. History Originally, State Road 842 was signed exclusively on Broward Boulevard. Starting in the mid-1980s, Las Olas Boulevard (SR A1A Alt.) was re-numbered and joined as part of State Road 842 from US 1 in downtown Fort Lauderdale to State Road A1A at the beach. Eventually the portion of Las Olas Boulevard between US 1 and Southeast 16th Avenue was transferred to the City of Fort Lauderdale, creating a gap in the route. In 2018, the Florida Department of Transportation released a new state highway system map, showing the rest of Las Olas Boulevard had been relinquished from the system, putting SR 842 exclusively on Broward Boulevard once again. CR 842 was created at some point between September 2009 and May 2018, when it was decommissioned from its state road designation.

Football career  Campbell was recruited from South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club North Adelaide, and made his senior VFL debut with the Brisbane Bears in their inaugural match in 1987. Campbell made a name for himself as a quick wingman, and went on to play 79 games for the club (and kick 28 goals) between 1987 and 1993. His career highlights include being selected as goalkeeper in International Rules Tests against Ireland in 1987 and 1990.  Media career  Following his retirement from football, Campbell has worked primarily as a television sports commentator, particularly for Australian rules football, first with the Seven Network, then Fox Footy. Originally based in Brisbane, he moved to Melbourne in early 2002. Campbell has also performed as an MC at sporting events, most commonly at boxing matches, including the Anthony Mundine-Darmel Castillo fight on 2 February 2005. In January 2006, Campbell was a replacement host on SEN 1116's Hungry for Sport program, but the closure of Fox Footy in October 2006 left him without regular TV commentary work. In 2007 he provided occasional commentary for ABC-TV telecasts of the Victorian Football League Match of the Day.

She served as the Oregon State Director for Rural Development with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A member of the Democratic Party, Walker previously served in both houses of the Oregon Legislature and briefly served as chair of the state's parole board. Walker is known as an advocate for utility customers and as an outspoken critic of influential former Governor Neil Goldschmidt. Early life Walker was born in Monroe, Washington, and graduated from Reedsport High School in Reedsport, Oregon, in 1974. She attended the University of Oregon and graduated in 1978 with a bachelor's degree in political science.  Career  After college, Walker was a self-employed court reporter from 1983, and a certified shorthand reporter. From 1992 to 1994, Walker served as the chair of the Lane County Democratic Central Committee. In addition, she served as secretary-treasurer and area representative for the Cal Young Neighborhood Association in Eugene. Walker has also volunteered on campaigns and has helped to fundraise for non-profit organizations. Oregon Legislature In November 1998, Walker was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives. She proposed legislation making the prevention of youth suicide a state priority as well as a bill that provides consumers protection from predatory lending practices. Walker was re-elected in 2000. She served on the Oregon House Judiciary, Criminal Law Subcommittee, Labor and Consumer Affairs, and Smart Growth & Commerce Committees. Walker was elected to the Oregon State Senate in November 2002 for the 7th District, covering Eugene, Junction City, and Harrisburg. She served as vice-chair of the Business and Labor Committee as well as a member of the Judiciary, Health Policy and General Government Committees. Legislation she sponsored included strengthening workers compensation and establishing civil penalties for e-mail spam.Spam Legislation: 2003 In 2005, she served as the chair of the Education and Workforce Committee and vice chair of the Energy and Public Lands Committee. Walker was elected to her second Senate term in 2006, defeating former Eugene mayor Jim Torrey (R). 2006 race for Governor Walker was critical of Governor Ted Kulongoski, a fellow Democrat, on many issues and considered challenging his bid for re-election in 2006, but ultimately did not run. On September 6, 2005, Walker stated, \\"I'm tired of the status quo, I'm not one of the good ol' boys. The good ol' boys have had a stranglehold over this state for a long time.\\" Walker, who had run only for offices in the Willamette Valley, would have faced an uphill battle in a statewide race. Fellow Democrat Pete Sorenson, another Willamette Valley Democrat who did run for governor in 2006, predicted that Walker would have a hard time raising money for her campaign. A poll done by Mike Riley in late 2005 showed Walker and several other Democratic challengers in single digits. Another factor that loomed over Walker's gubernatorial candidacy was the possibility that former two-term Governor John Kitzhaber might enter the race. A December 1, 2005 article asserted that Kitzhaber was considering challenging his successor, Kulongoski. Walker said \\"I wouldn't run against John Kitzhaber. That's the deciding factor.\\" On January 13, 2006, Kitzhaber said that he would not enter the race, leaving the door open for a possible run by Walker. However, Walker announced on February 1, 2006 that she would not seek the office, but would instead listen to voters in her State Senate District and run for re-election. Goldschmidt scandal Walker, a sexual assault victim, is partially responsible for forcing former governor Neil Goldschmidt to admit publicly that he had a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl in 1975 which lasted three years. Goldschmidt was Mayor of Portland at the time the relationship took place. Walker received the information from Portland Tribune Columnist Phil Stanford about the scandal, though it reportedly was not enough proof to go public. Walker was a longtime critic of Goldschmidt and tried unsuccessfully to prevent his appointment to the Oregon State Board of Higher Education in January 2004. A few months later, Walker passed the documents she had received from Stanford to a Willamette Week newspaper reporter. On May 6, 2004, Goldschmidt confessed publicly to the relationship after being told that an article in Willamette Week was going to be printed about the scandal. The story appeared in the paper less than a week later, and revealed that close friends and colleagues had kept quiet about the relationship for 30 years. Goldschmidt subsequently resigned from the Oregon State Bar and the Board of Higher Education. Campaign for Secretary of State At the conclusion of the 2007 legislative session, Walker announced her candidacy for Oregon Secretary of State in 2008. She finished third in the Democratic primary to Kate Brown and Rick Metsger. http://records.sos.state.or.us/ORSOSWebDrawer/Recordpdf/6873621 Later career In 2009, Walker was nominated by Governor Ted Kulongoski to a four- year term as chair of Oregon's Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision. She resigned from the Oregon State Senate on July 12, 2009, to begin her new position. In September of that year she withdrew herself for consideration for the position on the board prior to confirmation by the Oregon Senate. Walker did this after state government revenue forecasts determined the state would take in less money than anticipated, and thus a fourth position on the board would not be created as Governor Kulongoski had expected. Walker then took a temporary position with the parole board to last until the end of the year. On October 30, 2009, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced that Walker had been appointed as Oregon State Director for Rural Development with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Personal life  Walker and her husband Steven live in Eugene, and have two adult children, Adam and Sara.

Professional career=New Orleans Saints Grant was drafted by the Saints with the 25th pick overall in the 2002 NFL Draft. The Saints acquired the pick that was used to draft Grant through a trade with the Miami Dolphins that sent Ricky Williams to Miami. Grant's seven sacks in 2002 were the fourth-highest total for a Saints rookie, and he recorded 20.5 sacks from 2003-04. He was the second of two first-round picks (25th overall) for New Orleans in 2002, following wide receiver Donte' Stallworth (13th overall).

He also chipped in with 2 passes defensed. Grant underwent surgery on a torn ligament in his left ankle the 2007-2008 offseason. Grant apparently injured his ankle on October 28, 2007 but was able to return after missing two games. The severity of the injury was known by the Saints, but never discussed with the media, and Grant admitted that he was not as sharp after the injury. On December 2, 2008, he received a four-game suspension for use of a diuretic, which can be used a masking agent for steroid use. It is believed that the diuretic was found in a weight-loss supplement that he had been taking. Charles Grant was due to be suspended for the first 4 games of the Saints' 2009 season, but the league has delayed suspension pending the outcome of a filed litigation by Kevin Williams and Pat Williams of the Minnesota Vikings, who were also accused for using the same diuretic.NFL Suspends Six Players for Doping Violations, Sports Illustrated, December 2, 2008.

The part south of Route 113 in Tyngsborough is former US 3. The section from Burlington to Billerica is currently being widened from 2 to 4 lanes. History left From 1922 to 1926, Route 3A between Kingston and Quincy was New England Interstate Route 6A. In 1926, when New England Interstate Route 6 became Route 3, Route 6A became Route 3A. In the 1930s Route 3A's route was shifted onto new alignments built to reduce traffic problems in several communities through which the highway traversed. This included a bypass of Hingham Square along Broad Cove Road and Otis Street along Hingham Harbor replacing the original route that took it down Lincoln Street to downtown Hingham then along North Street to Summer Street. Chief Justice Cushing Highway was built around the same time and Route 3A was put on this highway from south of the Hingham Harbor rotary through Cohasset to Scituate. This replaced a routing along long-existing roadways such as Country Way in Scituate, South and North Main Streets in Cohasset and East Street to Summer Street in Hingham. Along East Street from Hull Street to Summer, Route 3A shared the highway with Route 128 in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In the 1950s and early 1960s Route 3A was extended to take over the original path of Route 3 south of Kingston to Plymouth and north of downtown Quincy to Neponset when Route 3 assumed its current freeway route. In between those locations, old Route 3 was designated Route 53. The section of old Route 3 from Cedarville south to the Sagamore Rotary near the Cape Cod Canal in Bourne is unnumbered. Much of Route 3A is sometimes referred to as the \\"Cape Way\\" due to its history as the only major road to Cape Cod from Boston prior to the opening of Route 3. The \\"Cape Way\\" name is reflected in numerous business names along 3A's length. rightThe section of Route 3A south of the intersection with Route 113 in Tyngsborough (all but the northern few miles of the route) was formerly U.S. Route 3, prior to the construction of the Northwest Expressway, a freeway connection from I-95 in Burlington to the Everett Turnpike in Nashua, New Hampshire, which was given the U.S. Route 3 designation.

The highway runs from the Connecticut state line in Sandisfield, where the highway continues as Connecticut Route 8, north to the Vermont state line in Clarksburg, where the highway continues as Vermont Route 8 and VT 100. Route 8 serves several towns in eastern and northern Berkshire County. The highway is the main highway between the cities of Pittsfield and North Adams, where the route intersects Route 9 and Route 2, respectively. Route 8 also intersects U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Becket. Route description Route 8 begins at the Connecticut state line, from which the highway continues south as Connecticut Route 8, in the southeastern corner of the town of Sandisfield and of Berkshire County. The two-lane highway heads north along the west side of Colebrook River Lake, an impoundment of the West Branch of the Farmington River that follows the Berkshire-Hampden county line. At the north end of the lake, Route 8 crosses over the river and very briefly runs atop the county line. The highway follows Main Street through the village center of New Boston, where it has a very short concurrency with Route 57 in which the routes cross to the west side of the river. Route 8 continues along the river into the town of Otis. In the center of town, the highway briefly runs concurrently with Route 23. Route 8 crosses the West Branch of the Farmington River a few times as it enters the town of Becket. In the hamlet of West Becket, which lies just south of the river's source, the highway meets US 20 (Jacobs Ladder Road). The U.S. Highway and state highway head east, passing under Interstate 90 (Massachusetts Turnpike) on their way to Bonny Rigg Corners. There, US 20 continues east along Chester Road and Route 8 turns north onto Main Street. Route 8 veers northwest and then north along Yokum Brook to the town center of Becket, where the highway begins to parallel CSX's Berkshire Subdivision rail line and Depot Brook. The highway follows the latter stream to its source in the town of Washington. Route 8 crosses over the railroad and begins to parallel the East Branch of the Housatonic River in the town of Hinsdale, where it meets the western end of Route 143. Route 8 continues northwest along the river and railroad to the town of Dalton, within which the highway follows Main Street. In the center of town, the route intersects Route 9 and Route 8A (North Street), which has its southern terminus at the intersection and is officially Route 8A(L). Routes 8 and 9 head west and enter the city of Pittsfield along Dalton Avenue. Shortly after entering the city, Route 8 turns north onto Cheshire Road and Route 9 veers southwest onto Merrill Road toward downtown Pittsfield, where the highway ends at US 20 and US 7. Route 8 heads north parallel to the Pittsfield-North Adams rail line into the town of Lanesborough, where the highway parallels the South Branch of the Hoosic River north from its source. The highway follows the east side of Cheshire Reservoir, an impoundment of the river, to the center of the town of Cheshire. Route 8 continues through the river valley on the east side of Mount Greylock and enters the town of Adams, where it meets the northern end of Route 116. Shortly after entering the city of North Adams, another Route 8A (officially Route 8A(U) splits east along Hodges Cross Road. In downtown North Adams, Route 8 crosses to the east of the South Branch of the Hoosic River, passes under Route 2 (Mohawk Trail) just south of the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, then curves east and then south along St. Anthony Drive and Holden Street, respectively, to intersect the other route. Routes 2 and 8 head east along a four-lane boulevard to Eagle Street, where the highways meet the northern end of Route 8A. The highways follow two-lane Mohawk Trail east across the North branch of the Hoosic River to Beaver Street, onto which Route 8 turns north. The highway follows the river north through the town of Clarksburg to the Vermont state line, where the road continues as VT 8 and VT 100.

It begins with Jesus' prediction that \\"I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of God has come with power\\".: NIV The chapter then recounts the transfiguration of Jesus, a healing miracle, and Jesus' teaching about the return of Elijah, humility and temptation. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 50 verses (49 verses in the Douai-Rheims version.Mark 9: Douai-Rheims Version) Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Codex Vaticanus (325-350; complete) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360; complete) *Codex Bezae (~400; complete) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440; complete) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; complete) Locations The events recorded in this chapter take place on \\"a high mountain\\" (traditionally understood to be Mount Tabor), in a nearby town, around Galilee and back in Capernaum. From Mount Tabor to Capernaum is about along modern Highway 65.Source: Google Maps Verse 1 :There are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of God has come with (or in) power. NRSV Anglican biblical scholar Edward Plumptre argues that this verse should be read with the final section of Mark 8 and suggests that the present arrangement may have been made with a view of connecting it with the Transfiguration as the fulfilment of the promise in this verse.Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers on Mark 9, accessed 13 June 2017 This verse is numbered as Mark 8:39 in the Douai-Rheims Bible. What exactly the kingdom of God refers to has been long debated. It immediately follows Jesus' statement of \\"... when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels.\\" (Mark 8:38) in the preceding chapter. This could simply refer to the following Transfiguration. Some have thought this refers to the Second Coming, an event most hold did not happen within the lifetimes of those present. This could be a prediction that came true if you take into account John's Revelation of the Second Coming while he was on the island of Patmos. Others have interpreted it as Jesus referring to his resurrection and/or the coming of Christianity. It is also recorded in Matthew 16:28 and Luke 9:27. Matthew adds the statement that \\"... then he will reward each person according to what he has done\\" between the two. The Transfiguration The Transfiguration (1520) by Raphael Six days pass and then Jesus takes Peter, James and John up an unnamed high mountain, which many came to believe was Mount Tabor. Suddenly, Jesus' clothes become dazzingly white \\"... whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.\\" (3) and Elijah and Moses appear. The disciples are stunned (for the first time Mark uses the term Rabbi Strong's G4461) and ask what they should do and offer to put up shelters or 'tabernacles' for them. A cloud overshadows them and a voice comes from the cloud saying \\"This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!\\" (7) which is what Jesus heard the \\"voice from heaven\\" say when he was baptised by John the Baptist in Mark 1 () but now Mark has Peter, James, and John as witnesses to this. Elijah and Moses disappear and they head down the mountain. On the way down the mountain, Jesus tells them to keep what had happened to themselves until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. They are confused as to what he means but do not ask him to clarify himself. They ask him about Elijah (Elias) and he says: :... Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought. But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him. () KJV It was commonly believed that Elijah would reappear before the coming of the Messiah, as predicted in Malachi 4. Matthew 17:13 states that the three of them believed Jesus was comparing Elijah to John the Baptist. The imprisonment and death of John the Baptist () may be compared to the persecution of Elijah by Jezebel ().Robertson, W. R., Expositor's Greek Testament on Mark 9, accessed 27 November 2017 Moses can be seen as a representative of the law and Elijah a representative of the prophets. This whole passage has echoes of Exodus 24, where clouds covered Mount Sinai for six days before Moses went up to receive the ten commandments. The original Greek uses the word metamorphothe which was translated into Latin as Trans Figura, the changing of appearance or of the body itself. The Possessed Boy They arrive back and find the rest of the disciples arguing with several teachers of the law surrounded by a crowd. As Jesus returns, the crowd are \\"amazed\\" at him: the New Revised Standard Version translates as \\"they were ... overcome with awe\\", suggesting that his appearance \\"still retained traces of His transfiguration-glory\\".Jamieson- Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary on Mark 9, accessed 28 November 2017 Jesus asks the crowd \\"What are you arguing about?\\" (v 16) and a man says he brought his possessed boy for Jesus to heal. The boy has a mute spirit and \\"foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid\\" - symptoms of epilepsy, which Matthew states to be the case. The man says the boy has been made to fall both into water and fire by the demon. Jesus' disciples could not heal him. Jesus says \\"You faithless generation\\" (v 19). He commands the boy be brought to him. The father begs Jesus to help the boy if he can, to which Jesus replies \\"Everything is possible for him who believes\\", and the man says \\"I believe. Help my unbelief!\\" (verse 24) Jesus heals the boy: when asked by the disciples privately why they could not cast it out, he replies \\"This kind can come out only through prayer and fasting\\" (v 29). Predictions about the crucifixion Jesus tells his entire group again that the Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men, killed, and after three days he will rise again.; cf. This is the second prediction of the Passion in Mark's Gospel, although in the first prediction there is no reference to betrayal. Theologian Marvin Vincent notes that the Greek reads \\"·ºêŒ¥ŒØŒ¥Œ±œÉŒ∫ŒµŒΩ\\" (edidasken), and the Revised Version would have done better to give the force of the imperfect here: He was teaching. He sought seclusion because he was engaged for the time in instructing. The teaching was the continuation of the \\"began to teach\\" (Mark 8:31)\\".Vincent, M., Vincent's Word Studies on Mark 9, accessed 29 November 2017 Jesus' disciples still do not understand what he means but they are afraid to ask him to clarify himself. William Robertson Nicoll notes that \\"they had heard the statement before, and had not forgotten the fact, and their Master had spoken too explicitly for them to be in any doubt as to His meaning. What they were ignorant of was the why\\". Skeptics dismiss these predictions as not actually made by the real Jesus but regard them as an example of vaticinium ex eventu. Scholars such as Raymond E. Brown believe, however, that \\"the difficulty in dismissing all these predictions as totally postJesus creations is exemplified in 9:31 where many scholars recognize Semitic features and old tradition.\\" (140) Teaching in Capernaum They go back to Capernaum and in the house, Jesus asks what the disciples were discussing or arguing about on the road. They do not answer, because they had been arguing about who was, or who would be, the greatest disciple, possibly because Jesus only took three of them with him up the mountain Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Mark 9, accessed 16 June 2017 and the remaining nine could not cure the boy. In Matthew's account, the subject was introduced by the disciples themselves, who came and asked Jesus who should be greatest. Jesus already knows what they had been talking about, however, and he summons the twelve, sits down with them (Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒØœÉŒ±œÇ, kathisas, indicating that Jesus takes His seat in a deliberate attempt to school the disciples) and instructs them: :If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all. He takes a child (verse 36, but verse 35 in the Douai-Rheims version) in his arms and says whoever welcomes children welcomes him and therefore God. John says some other group of people have been healing people in Jesus' name even though they were not part of the group, but Jesus is pleased and says \\"... For he who is not against us is for us.\\" (). In and Jesus says: \\"He who is not with Me is against Me\\"; see also You're either with us, or against us. The disciples seem to think one needs to be part of Jesus' personal group but Jesus makes clear that anyone who works in his name and does his work is also for him. He then gives one of the most forceful condemnations of sin in the Bible (see Stumbling block): :And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another. (42-50) KJV Jerusalem The text quotes the final verse of the Book of Isaiah: :\\"And they will go out and look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me; the worms that eat them will not die, the fire that burns them will not be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind\\". The Pulpit Commentary observes that the bodies cast into hell \\"could not be at the same time burnt with fire and eaten by worms\\".Pulpit Commentary on Isaiah 66, accessed 30 November 2017 The original manuscripts use the term \\"œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ Œ≥Œ≠ŒµŒΩŒΩŒ±ŒΩ\\" (tƒìn geennan) Gehenna for Hell. Gehenna was a trash dump next to Jerusalem in the Hinnom valley, where the dead bodies of criminals as well as trash were burned. The valley was named after a man named Hinnom who had owned it. It had at one time been used as a place to sacrifice live children to Pagan Gods. What exactly the \\"salt\\" Jesus was referring to was is unclear. Jesus relates it to fire, the good, and peace. Salt was seen as a thing of purity, but salt also has destructive properties and was used as a preservative. \\"Salt\\" might simply refer to his teaching. It also might be seen as an interlocking double metaphor relating the salt required in sacrifices to God found in Leviticus 2:11,13 to the \\"salt\\" of the sacrifice of Christ and to the \\"salt\\" required to be in followers of Jesus as metaphorical sacrifices as in Romans 12 and also relating the salt of the Old Covenant from Leviticus 2:11,13 to the \\"salt\\" of the new or renewed covenant. See Salt in Mark and also Salt and Light. Comparison with other canonical gospels Luke 9 has almost the entire chapter of Mark 9 contained verbatim with the notable exception of the speech about sin that is partly contained in Luke, chapter 17. Matthew has the Transfiguration and the possessed boy followed by a slightly altered and expanded scene in Capernaum in chapters 17 and 18. John lists none of this, which has puzzled many scholars since one would think John, since he was one of the only three there, would mention the Transfiguration. This could mean that Mark is wrong about either the event or John being there, the Gospel of John was not written by the Apostle John, or John knew the synoptics were circulating and wrote his gospel to fill in details he thought lacking in them.

It is a relatively new discipline within medicine, neuroscience, and psychology. Physicians who specialize in the performance and interpretation of neuroimaging in the clinical setting are neuroradiologists. Neuroimaging falls into two broad categories: * Structural imaging, which deals with the structure of the nervous system and the diagnosis of gross (large scale) intracranial disease (such as a tumor) and injury. * Functional imaging, which is used to diagnose metabolic diseases and lesions on a finer scale (such as Alzheimer's disease) and also for neurological and cognitive psychology research and building brain-computer interfaces. Functional imaging enables, for example, the processing of information by centers in the brain to be visualized directly. Such processing causes the involved area of the brain to increase metabolism and \\"light up\\" on the scan. One of the more controversial uses of neuroimaging has been researching \\"thought identification\\" or mind-reading. History Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of a head, from top to base of the skull The first chapter of the history of neuroimaging traces back to the Italian neuroscientist Angelo Mosso who invented the 'human circulation balance', which could non-invasively measure the redistribution of blood during emotional and intellectual activity. In 1918, the American neurosurgeon Walter Dandy introduced the technique of ventriculography. X-ray images of the ventricular system within the brain were obtained by injection of filtered air directly into one or both lateral ventricles of the brain. Dandy also observed that air introduced into the subarachnoid space via lumbar spinal puncture could enter the cerebral ventricles and also demonstrate the cerebrospinal fluid compartments around the base of the brain and over its surface. This technique was called pneumoencephalography. In 1927, Egas Moniz introduced cerebral angiography, whereby both normal and abnormal blood vessels in and around the brain could be visualized with great precision. In the early 1970s, Allan McLeod Cormack and Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield introduced computerized axial tomography (CAT or CT scanning), and ever more detailed anatomic images of the brain became available for diagnostic and research purposes. Cormack and Hounsfield won the 1979 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their work. Soon after the introduction of CAT in the early 1980s, the development of radioligands allowed single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) of the brain. More or less concurrently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI or MR scanning) was developed by researchers including Peter Mansfield and Paul Lauterbur, who were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2003. In the early 1980s MRI was introduced clinically, and during the 1980s a veritable explosion of technical refinements and diagnostic MR applications took place. Scientists soon learned that the large blood flow changes measured by PET could also be imaged by the correct type of MRI. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was born, and since the 1990s, fMRI has come to dominate the brain mapping field due to its low invasiveness, lack of radiation exposure, and relatively wide availability. In the early 2000s, the field of neuroimaging reached the stage where limited practical applications of functional brain imaging have become feasible. The main application area is crude forms of brain-computer interface. Indications Neuroimaging follows a neurological examination in which a physician has found cause to more deeply investigate a patient who has or may have a neurological disorder. One of the more common neurological problems which a person may experience is simple syncope., which cites  In cases of simple syncope in which the patient's history does not suggest other neurological symptoms, the diagnosis includes a neurological examination but routine neurological imaging is not indicated because the likelihood of finding a cause in the central nervous system is extremely low and the patient is unlikely to benefit from the procedure. Neuroimaging is not indicated for patients with stable headaches which are diagnosed as migraine., which cites  Studies indicate that presence of migraine does not increase a patient's risk for intracranial disease. A diagnosis of migraine which notes the absence of other problems, such as papilledema, would not indicate a need for neuroimaging. In the course of conducting a careful diagnosis, the physician should consider whether the headache has a cause other than the migraine and might require neuroimaging. Another indication for neuroimaging is CT-, MRI- and PET-guided stereotactic surgery or radiosurgery for treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations and other surgically treatable conditions. Brain imaging techniques= Computed axial tomography  Computed tomography (CT) or Computed Axial Tomography (CAT) scanning uses a series of x-rays of the head taken from many different directions. Typically used for quickly viewing brain injuries, CT scanning uses a computer program that performs a numerical integral calculation (the inverse Radon transform) on the measured x-ray series to estimate how much of an x-ray beam is absorbed in a small volume of the brain. Typically the information is presented as cross-sections of the brain.  Diffuse optical imaging  Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) or diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a medical imaging modality which uses near infrared light to generate images of the body. The technique measures the optical absorption of haemoglobin, and relies on the absorption spectrum of haemoglobin varying with its oxygenation status. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) has been compared directly to fMRI using response to visual stimulation in subjects studied with both techniques, with reassuringly similar results. HD- DOT has also been compared to fMRI in terms of language tasks and resting state functional connectivity.  Event-related optical signal  Event- related optical signal (EROS) is a brain-scanning technique which uses infrared light through optical fibers to measure changes in optical properties of active areas of the cerebral cortex. Whereas techniques such as diffuse optical imaging (DOT) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measure optical absorption of haemoglobin, and thus are based on blood flow, EROS takes advantage of the scattering properties of the neurons themselves and thus provides a much more direct measure of cellular activity. EROS can pinpoint activity in the brain within millimeters (spatially) and within milliseconds (temporally). Its biggest downside is the inability to detect activity more than a few centimeters deep. EROS is a new, relatively inexpensive technique that is non-invasive to the test subject. It was developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where it is now used in the Cognitive Neuroimaging Laboratory of Dr. Gabriele Gratton and Dr. Monica Fabiani.  Magnetic resonance imaging  Sagittal MRI slice at the midline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce high quality two- or three-dimensional images of brain structures without the use of ionizing radiation (X-rays) or radioactive tracers.  Functional magnetic resonance imaging  Axial MRI slice at the level of the basal ganglia, showing fMRI BOLD signal changes overlaid in red (increase) and blue (decrease) tones. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) relies on the paramagnetic properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin to see images of changing blood flow in the brain associated with neural activity. This allows images to be generated that reflect which brain structures are activated (and how) during the performance of different tasks or at resting state. According to the oxygenation hypothesis, changes in oxygen usage in regional cerebral blood flow during cognitive or behavioral activity can be associated with the regional neurons as being directly related to the cognitive or behavioral tasks being attended. Most fMRI scanners allow subjects to be presented with different visual images, sounds and touch stimuli, and to make different actions such as pressing a button or moving a joystick. Consequently, fMRI can be used to reveal brain structures and processes associated with perception, thought and action. The resolution of fMRI is about 2-3 millimeters at present, limited by the spatial spread of the hemodynamic response to neural activity. It has largely superseded PET for the study of brain activation patterns. PET, however, retains the significant advantage of being able to identify specific brain receptors (or transporters) associated with particular neurotransmitters through its ability to image radiolabelled receptor \\"ligands\\" (receptor ligands are any chemicals that stick to receptors). As well as research on healthy subjects, fMRI is increasingly used for the medical diagnosis of disease. Because fMRI is exquisitely sensitive to oxygen usage in blood flow, it is extremely sensitive to early changes in the brain resulting from ischemia (abnormally low blood flow), such as the changes which follow stroke. Early diagnosis of certain types of stroke is increasingly important in neurology, since substances which dissolve blood clots may be used in the first few hours after certain types of stroke occur, but are dangerous to use afterward. Brain changes seen on fMRI may help to make the decision to treat with these agents. With between 72% and 90% accuracy where chance would achieve 0.8%, fMRI techniques can decide which of a set of known images the subject is viewing.  Magnetoencephalography  Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is an imaging technique used to measure the magnetic fields produced by electrical activity in the brain via extremely sensitive devices such as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) or spin exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometers. MEG offers a very direct measurement of neural electrical activity (compared to fMRI for example) with very high temporal resolution but relatively low spatial resolution. The advantage of measuring the magnetic fields produced by neural activity is that they are likely to be less distorted by surrounding tissue (particularly the skull and scalp) compared to the electric fields measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Specifically, it can be shown that magnetic fields produced by electrical activity are not affected by the surrounding head tissue, when the head is modeled as a set of concentric spherical shells, each being an isotropic homogeneous conductor. Real heads are non-spherical and have largely anisotropic conductivities (particularly white matter and skull). While skull anisotropy has a negligible effect on MEG (unlike EEG), white matter anisotropy strongly affects MEG measurements for radial and deep sources. Note, however, that the skull was assumed to be uniformly anisotropic in this study, which is not true for a real head: the absolute and relative thicknesses of diplo√´ and tables layers vary among and within the skull bones. This makes it likely that MEG is also affected by the skull anisotropy, although probably not to the same degree as EEG. There are many uses for MEG, including assisting surgeons in localizing a pathology, assisting researchers in determining the function of various parts of the brain, neurofeedback, and others.  Positron emission tomography  Positron emission tomography (PET) and brain positron emission tomography, measure emissions from radioactively labeled metabolically active chemicals that have been injected into the bloodstream. The emission data are computer-processed to produce 2- or 3-dimensional images of the distribution of the chemicals throughout the brain. The positron emitting radioisotopes used are produced by a cyclotron, and chemicals are labeled with these radioactive atoms. The labeled compound, called a radiotracer, is injected into the bloodstream and eventually makes its way to the brain. Sensors in the PET scanner detect the radioactivity as the compound accumulates in various regions of the brain. A computer uses the data gathered by the sensors to create multicolored 2- or 3-dimensional images that show where the compound acts in the brain. Especially useful are a wide array of ligands used to map different aspects of neurotransmitter activity, with by far the most commonly used PET tracer being a labeled form of glucose (see Fludeoxyglucose (18F) (FDG)). The greatest benefit of PET scanning is that different compounds can show blood flow and oxygen and glucose metabolism in the tissues of the working brain. These measurements reflect the amount of brain activity in the various regions of the brain and allow to learn more about how the brain works. PET scans were superior to all other metabolic imaging methods in terms of resolution and speed of completion (as little as 30 seconds) when they first became available. The improved resolution permitted better study to be made as to the area of the brain activated by a particular task. The biggest drawback of PET scanning is that because the radioactivity decays rapidly, it is limited to monitoring short tasks. Before fMRI technology came online, PET scanning was the preferred method of functional (as opposed to structural) brain imaging, and it continues to make large contributions to neuroscience. PET scanning is also used for diagnosis of brain disease, most notably because brain tumors, strokes, and neuron- damaging diseases which cause dementia (such as Alzheimer's disease) all cause great changes in brain metabolism, which in turn causes easily detectable changes in PET scans. PET is probably most useful in early cases of certain dementias (with classic examples being Alzheimer's disease and Pick's disease) where the early damage is too diffuse and makes too little difference in brain volume and gross structure to change CT and standard MRI images enough to be able to reliably differentiate it from the \\"normal\\" range of cortical atrophy which occurs with aging (in many but not all) persons, and which does not cause clinical dementia.  Single-photon emission computed tomography  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is similar to PET and uses gamma ray-emitting radioisotopes and a gamma camera to record data that a computer uses to construct two- or three-dimensional images of active brain regions.Philip Ball Brain Imaging Explained SPECT relies on an injection of radioactive tracer, or \\"SPECT agent,\\" which is rapidly taken up by the brain but does not redistribute. Uptake of SPECT agent is nearly 100% complete within 30 to 60 seconds, reflecting cerebral blood flow (CBF) at the time of injection. These properties of SPECT make it particularly well-suited for epilepsy imaging, which is usually made difficult by problems with patient movement and variable seizure types. SPECT provides a \\"snapshot\\" of cerebral blood flow since scans can be acquired after seizure termination (so long as the radioactive tracer was injected at the time of the seizure). A significant limitation of SPECT is its poor resolution (about 1 cm) compared to that of MRI. Today, SPECT machines with Dual Detector Heads are commonly used, although Triple Detector Head machines are available in the marketplace. Tomographic reconstruction, (mainly used for functional \\"snapshots\\" of the brain) requires multiple projections from Detector Heads which rotate around the human skull, so some researchers have developed 6 and 11 Detector Head SPECT machines to cut imaging time and give higher resolution. Like PET, SPECT also can be used to differentiate different kinds of disease processes which produce dementia, and it is increasingly used for this purpose. Neuro-PET has a disadvantage of requiring the use of tracers with half-lives of at most 110 minutes, such as FDG. These must be made in a cyclotron, and are expensive or even unavailable if necessary transport times are prolonged more than a few half-lives. SPECT, however, is able to make use of tracers with much longer half-lives, such as technetium-99m, and as a result, is far more widely available. Cranial ultrasound Cranial ultrasound is usually only used in babies, whose open fontanelles provide acoustic windows allowing ultrasound imaging of the brain. Advantages include the absence of ionising radiation and the possibility of bedside scanning, but the lack of soft-tissue detail means MRI is preferred for some conditions. Functional ultrasound imaging Functional ultrasound imaging (fUS) is a medical ultrasound imaging technique of detecting or measuring changes in neural activities or metabolism, for example, the loci of brain activity, typically through measuring blood flow or hemodynamic changes. Functional ultrasound relies on Ultrasensitive Doppler and ultrafast ultrasound imaging which allows high sensitivity blood flow imaging.  Advantages and concerns of neuroimaging techniques = Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)  fMRI is commonly classified as a minimally-to-moderate risk due to its non-invasiveness compared to other imaging methods. fMRI uses blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)-contrast in order to produce its form of imaging. BOLD-contrast is a naturally occurring process in the body so fMRI is often preferred over imaging methods that require radioactive markers to produce similar imaging. A concern in the use of fMRI is its use in individuals with medical implants or devices and metallic items in the body. The magnetic resonance (MR) emitted from the equipment can cause failure of medical devices and attract metallic objects in the body if not properly screened for. Currently, the FDA classifies medical implants and devices into three categories, depending on MR-compatibility: MR- safe (safe in all MR environments), MR-unsafe (unsafe in any MR environment), and MR-conditional (MR-compatible in certain environments, requiring further information). File:MR safe sign.svgMR Safe File:MR conditional sign.svgMR Conditional File:MR unsafe sign.svgMR Unsafe  Computed Tomography (CT) Scan  The CT scan was introduced in the 1970s and quickly became one of the most widely used methods of imaging. A CT scan can be performed in under a second and produce rapid results for clinicians, with its ease of use leading to an increase in CT scans performed in the United States from 3 million in 1980 to 62 million in 2007. Clinicians oftentimes take multiple scans, with 30% of individuals undergoing at least 3 scans in one study of CT scan usage. CT scans can expose patients to levels of radiation 100-500 times higher than traditional x-rays, with higher radiation doses producing better resolution imaging. While easy to use, increases in CT scan use, especially in asymptomatic patients, is a topic of concern since patients are exposed to significantly high levels of radiation.  Positron Emission Tomography (PET)  In PET scans, imaging does not rely on intrinsic biological processes, but relies on a foreign substance injected into the bloodstream traveling to the brain. Patients are injected with radioisotopes that are metabolized in the brain and emit positrons to produce a visualization of brain activity. The amount of radiation a patient is exposed to in a PET scan is relatively small, comparable to the amount of environmental radiation an individual is exposed to across a year. PET radioisotopes have limited exposure time in the body as they commonly have very short half-lives (~2 hours) and decay rapidly. Currently, fMRI is a preferred method of imaging brain activity compared to PET, since it does not involve radiation, has a higher temporal resolution than PET, and is more readily available in most medical settings.  Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG)  The high temporal resolution of MEG and EEG allow these methods to measure brain activity down to the millisecond. Both MEG and EEG do not require exposure of the patient to radiation to function. EEG electrodes detect electrical signals produced by neurons to measure brain activity and MEG uses oscillations in the magnetic field produced by these electrical currents to measure activity. A barrier in the widespread usage of MEG is due to pricing, as MEG systems can cost millions of dollars. EEG is a much more widely used method to achieve such temporal resolution as EEG systems cost much less than MEG systems. A disadvantage of EEG and MEG is that both methods have poor spatial resolution when compared to fMRI. Criticism and cautions Some scientists have criticized the brain image-based claims made in scientific journals and the popular press, like the discovery of \\"the part of the brain responsible\\" for functions like talents, specific memories, or generating emotions such as love. Many mapping techniques have a relatively low resolution, including hundreds of thousands of neurons in a single voxel. Many functions also involve multiple parts of the brain, meaning that this type of claim is probably both unverifiable with the equipment used, and generally based on an incorrect assumption about how brain functions are divided. It may be that most brain functions will only be described correctly after being measured with much more fine-grained measurements that look not at large regions but instead at a very large number of tiny individual brain circuits. Many of these studies also have technical problems like small sample size or poor equipment calibration which means they cannot be reproduced - considerations which are sometimes ignored to produce a sensational journal article or news headline. In some cases the brain mapping techniques are used for commercial purposes, lie detection, or medical diagnosis in ways which have not been scientifically validated.

They were a continuation of the R6 fleet and closely resemble them. A total of 250 cars were built, all arranged as single units. Two versions were ordered: the R7, which consisted of 150 cars, numbered 1400‚Äì1549, and the R7A, which consisted of 100 cars, numbered 1550‚Äì1649. The R7s and R7As were used primarily for increased service in Queens and the opening of the Crosstown Line. They served exclusively on all IND lines for most of their service lives, but were also used on the BMT Division during their final years. The R44s and R46s replaced the R7 cars, and they made their final runs in 1977. Two cars, one R7 and one R7A, have been preserved, while the rest of the fleet was scrapped.  History  On March 5, 1937, the New York City Board of Transportation opened up bids for 150 cars to be built under the R7 contract. The winning bid for $40,375 per car was jointly submitted by the American Car and Foundry Company (ACF) and Pullman Standard. The Pressed Steel Company also submitted a bid, for $40,850 per car. On July 27, 1937, it was announced that the winning bid for 100 additional cars, under contract R7A, went to ACF and Pullman for $41,951 per car. Additional bids were made by Pressed Steel ($42,200) and Bethlehem Steel ($43,100). The increased in price per car was attributed to strikes in the steel industry. The R7s were built in 1937, and the R7As were built in 1938. Together, the R7/As provided additional cars for expanded service in Queens and for the opening of the IND Crosstown Line. They were used for service on the IND exclusively until 1968 or 1969, when they were displaced from the IND by the new R40s and R42s and transferred to the East New York Yard. Many R7/As were replaced by the R44s. Most other cars ran on the Eastern Division until 1977, when they were finally replaced by the R46s. Preservation Following their retirement, all but two cars were scrapped. The two cars that were not scrapped have survived into preservation: *R7 car 1440 has been preserved by the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine. It is modified with trolley poles and used in various tourist rides around the museum, often coupled to R4 car 800. *R7A car 1575 has been preserved by the New York Transit Museum. It was restored to operating condition and has been used in excursions sponsored by the Transit Museum since 2003. During its service life, it was rebuilt from its original appearance by ACF in 1947 following an accident in 1946, and became the prototype for the R10. It was designed to test new interior and cosmetic features. While it cosmetically resembles an R10, mechanically and electrically, it is still an R7A and can only operate with other pre-war IND Arnines.https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_Independent_Fleet_(1932-1939)#Car_Noteshttps://www.nycsubway.org/perl/caption.pl?/img/cars/sheet008a-r7a-1575.jpg ReferencesFurther reading * Sansone, Gene.

The siege was led primarily by Pontiac, an Ottawa chief and military leader. This rebellion would be one of the catalysts that hastened the declaration of the Proclamation of 1763 which would eventually precipitate the events leading to the American Revolution. Background Fort Detroit had been captured by the British during the French and Indian War following the Fall of Montreal in 1760. It was on territory ceded by France to Great Britain in the Treaty of Paris in 1763 and was garrisoned by a British force during Pontiac's Rebellion. Originally allied with the British forces due to promises of blankets gunpowder, and rum among other valuables, a large force of 700 Native Americans--Ottawas, Pottawatomis, Hurons (Wyandots), and Chippewas (Ojibways)--watched as the fort changed hands on November 29, 1760 by French commander Captain Fran√ßois-Marie Picot√© de Belestre to famous British Ranger commander Major Robert Rogers. After the British took control over Fort Detroit, the native inhabitants surrounding the fort grew discontent at the amount of goods that were being made available to trade to them. Primarily, the natives were upset at the lack of rum, powder, ammunition, and gifts that were offered by the British for trading. Yet despite attempts by the Colonial Superintendent to Indian Affairs, Sir William Johnson, to appease the natives by gifting them garden hoes, and promising lower trade prices, a physician available at the fort, and a gunsmith, the natives remained distrustful of the new British garrison. Looking to take advantage of this growing animosity towards the British and tacit support from local French settlers, a highly influential Ottawa Chief by the name of Pontiac gathered neighboring tribes to form a military alliance. On the night of April 27, 1763, Chief Pontiac held a council 10 miles form Fort Detroit off the Ecorse River where he was able to recruit, using the teachings of Neolin the local tribes of the Pottawatomi, Hurons, and Chippewas, along with his tribe of Ottawa to launch an assault on the British garrison at Detroit in the future. The life of Pontiac before the events of the siege are not well known. Although, it is known that he was born into the two most powerful tribes of the Great Lakes area in the Ojibwa and Ottawa (his parents were of those tribes). He participated in the French and Indian War where he gained influence among other tribes in lobbying other chiefs into continue supporting the French. It is estimated that he was between 40-50 years old at the start of the Siege of Detroit. First Attempt Before attempting any serious assault on the fort, Pontiac ventured to Fort Detroit with a following of 40-50 Ottawa to conduct a reconnaissance of the Fort so as to estimate the strength of the garrison and identify trading posts to plunder. Upon entering Pontiac entertained British officers with a ceremonial dance while 10 of his followers dispersed through the stockade.On May 6, 1763 a small surveying party on the St Clair River from Fort Detroit was ambushed and the occupants either captured or killed; (among those killed was Sir Robert Davers, 5th Baronet (c. 1730‚Äì1763), of the Davers baronets). Ottawa chief Pontiac visits Major Henry Gladwin, commanding Fort Detroit, planning to kill him and start a massacre of the English. Gladwin, fore-warned, dismisses him. Engraving by \\"WLJ\\" in Cassell's History of the World On May 7, Pontiac entered the fort with about 300 men, armed with weapons hidden under blankets, determined to take the fort by surprise. The plan was for Pontiac to give a speech to Major Gladwin while holding a wampum belt. Once Pontiac gave the signal, the 60 Ottawa in the fort would attack the British forces while the Huron and Pottawatomi forces surrounded the fort to capture any settlers and intercept British reinforcements. However, the British commander Henry Gladwin had apparently been informed of Pontiac's plan, and the garrison of about 120 men was armed and ready.Borneman, The French and Indian War, 286 Pontiac withdrew and, two days later, laid siege to the fort. On May 9th, Pontiac returned with a contingent of 64 canoes filled with his followers and demanded that he be let in so as to smoke with Major Gladwin. Gladwin responded that only Pontiac would be let in which prompted Pontiac to give up his subversive activities and initiate the siege. Immediately after the initiation of the siege, a number of British soldiers and civilians in the area outside the fort were captured or killed; Letter from former captive John Rutherfurd August 20, 1763 .pp.114-115A Longer narrative of Rutherford captivity written in 1764 appears in Transactions of the Canadian Institute, Volume 3 1892.pp.229-252 one of the soldiers was ritually cannibalized, as was the custom in some Great Lakes Indian cultures. The violence was directed only at the British: French colonists were left alone. Eventually more than 900 Indian warriors from a half-dozen tribes would join the siege.  The Siege  At the start of the siege, Pontiac moved his encampment 2 miles North of Fort Detroit at the mouth of what is now Bloody Run Creek (formerly Parent's Creek) which would become the sight of a major ambush later. Shortly after the start of the siege, Pontiac met with two British officers to inquire about a potential peace at the house of a Frenchman. There, Pontiac took the two men hostage until resolution of the peace talks. With the peace talk going nowhere, Pontiac renewed his assault on the fort, but his weapons were ineffectual against the walls of the fort. Eventually, Pontiac's forces pulled back their front line which enabled the British to venture out of the fort and destroy any potential cover (trees, fences) for the Indians that surrounded the fort. At the start of the siege, Fort Detroit was a square shaped stockade at 1,000 yards circumference surrounded by a palisade with cannons and mortars mounted on bastions. Inside the fort resided approximately 2,500 people with 120 fighting men who consisted of one company of the 60th Royal American and Queen's Rangers along with armed traders and loyal Frenchmen. The supplies of the fort were dwindling with only ten days rations left at the start of the siege. Directly outside the fort, on the Detroit River, was the schooner Huron and the sloop Michigan each armed with six and ten cannons respectively. In need of supplies and reinforcements, a force of close to a hundred men set out on Lake Erie to reach Fort Detroit. Those who escaped made their way to Fort Sandusky, but found it destroyed, and so they returned to Fort Niagara. The Indians took their captives to Detroit, where they were tortured and mutilated. The bodies were then tossed into the river to float by Fort Detroit, which undermined morale in the fort. The detachment of small boats led by a Lieutenant Cuyler, stopped by the mouth of the Detroit River on the North shore to make camp when they were ambushed. Only 40 of the detachment escaped along with Lieutenant Cuyler while close to 60 were killed or captured. This battle would eventually become known as the Battle of Point Pelee. Not long after the battle, the schooner Huron fought off a assault of canoes that were approaching it from all sides. 14 of Pontiac's men were killed in the failed assault with no British casualties. The ships were targeted again on the night of July 9th when Pontiac sent small boats filled with burning sticks and tar to ignite the wooden hulls of the ships. The ships were able to dodge the floating hazards and were subjected to the same the following night although neither attempts by Pontiac's forces were successful. On July 29th, a force of 260 British soldiers commanded by Captain James Dalyell arrived on the river to reinforce Fort Detroit along with a contingent of Queen's Rangers led by Robert Rogers himself.  Battle of Bloody Run  The day after arriving at the fort, Captain Dalyell persuaded Major Gladwin to allow him to take a force of 247 soldiers and ambush Pontiac's encampment. The force started out at 2:30 am towards Parent's Creek (now Bloody Run Creek) where they were instead ambushed by 150 of Pontiac's men who had advance intelligence from French spies that a British force was incoming. Pontiac laid a plan to trap the British and sent 250 of his warriors to prevent the British retreat back towards the fort. Upon first crossing the river, the British force was met with a wave of Indian gunfire and retreated in confusion. While the British were eventually able to break through Pontiac's trap by capturing a local barn to provide covering fire while the rest of the force fought their way back up until reaching the fort doors. It cost them 23 dead, 34 wounded, and the death of Captain Dalyell.  End of the Siege  Fort Detroit circa 1710 The fort would hold throughout the summer and fall without much military action from either side since both were keen to avoid losses. However, the situation at the fort remained a stalemate, and Pontiac's influence among his followers began to wane. Groups of Indians began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. On October 31, 1763, finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid, Pontiac lifted the siege and traveled south to the Maumee River, where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British. Ultimately, Pontiac's unsuccessful attempt to take Fort Detroit and achieve success in his rebellion did not change the status quo relationship between the British and the natives that existed before the conflict. Native life was greatly disrupted from losing many people and opportunitites to invest in other economic activities. For the British, this widely ensured that they could focus their attention on the coastal colonies since the backcountry was mostly subdued. In time (October of 1763), this would result in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 that would signify a change in British policy towards the American frontier that would lead to the American Revolutionary War.

A total of 153 cars were built, numbered 1650‚Äì1802, and arranged as single units. They were the last \\"Arnine\\" type cars that were ordered before the merger of the IND with the IRT and BMT in 1940. The R9s were ordered in preparation for the opening of the IND Sixth Avenue Line, the second IND trunk line in Manhattan to open after the IND Eighth Avenue Line. They were used primarily for increased service in Queens and the opening of the Crosstown Line. They served exclusively on all IND lines for most of their service lives, but were also used on the BMT Division during their final years. The R46s replaced the R9 cars, with the final run taking place on March 31, 1977. Three cars were preserved, while the rest were scrapped. History A total of 153 R9 cars were ordered from two different manufacturers. Cars 1650‚Äì1701 were built by ACF, while cars 1702‚Äì1802 were built by Pressed Steel. 150 of the new cars were ordered for service on the new IND Sixth Avenue Line, which opened on December 15, 1940. The Sixth Avenue Line was the second IND Manhattan trunk line (joining the 1932 IND Eighth Avenue Line), and therefore the additional cars were needed for the new service. The remaining 3 cars, cars 1800‚Äì1802, were ordered as replacements for three older IND cars (R1 cars 212 & 378 and R4 car 472) that had been damaged beyond repair as a result of a February 17, 1936 collision at the Smith‚ÄìNinth Streets station. The 153 R9 cars remained the newest part of the IND fleet until the arrival of the R10 cars in 1948. The R9s were also used for service on the IND exclusively until 1968, when they were displaced by the new R40 cars. They were then transferred to the East New York Yard of the Eastern Division and used on the former BMT J, KK, LL, M, and QJ routes. Retirement The fleet of R9 cars stayed intact and in service until being replaced by the R46s between 1976 and 1977. The last day of R9 cars in service was on March 31, 1977, as the cars made their final run on the train. Following their retirement, the majority of the cars were scrapped. However, three have been preserved: * Car 1689 has been preserved by the Shore Line Trolley Museum in East Haven, Connecticut, and restored.

Genotype B shows a strongly bimodal distribution indicating differentiation into distinct phenotypes. Each phenotype that results from genotype B is buffered against environmental variation‚Äîit is canalised. Canalisation is a measure of the ability of a population to produce the same phenotype regardless of variability of its environment or genotype. It is a form of evolutionary robustness. The term was coined in 1942 by C. H. Waddington to capture the fact that \\"developmental reactions, as they occur in organisms submitted to natural selection...are adjusted so as to bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions during the course of the reaction\\". He used this word rather than robustness to take into account that biological systems are not robust in quite the same way as, for example, engineered systems. Biological robustness or canalisation comes about when developmental pathways are shaped by evolution. Waddington introduced the concept of the epigenetic landscape, in which the state of an organism rolls \\"downhill\\" during development. In this metaphor, a canalised trait is illustrated as a valley (which he called a creode) enclosed by high ridges, safely guiding the phenotype to its \\"fate\\". Waddington claimed that canals form in the epigenetic landscape during evolution, and that this heuristic is useful for understanding the unique qualities of biological robustness. Genetic assimilation Waddington used the concept of canalisation to explain his experiments on genetic assimilation. In these experiments, he exposed Drosophila pupae to heat shock. This environmental disturbance caused some flies to develop a crossveinless phenotype. He then selected for crossveinless. Eventually, the crossveinless phenotype appeared even without heat shock. Through this process of genetic assimilation, an environmentally induced phenotype had become inherited. Waddington explained this as the formation of a new canal in the epigenetic landscape. It is, however, possible to explain genetic assimilation using only quantitative genetics and a threshold model, with no reference to the concept of canalisation. However, theoretical models that incorporate a complex genotype‚Äìphenotype map have found evidence for the evolution of phenotypic robustness contributing to genetic assimilation, even when selection is only for developmental stability and not for a particular phenotype, and so the quantitative genetics models do not apply. These studies suggest that the canalisation heuristic may still be useful, beyond the more simple concept of robustness. Congruence hypothesis Neither canalisation nor robustness are simple quantities to quantify: it is always necessary to specify which trait is canalised (robust) to which perturbations. For example, perturbations can come either from the environment or from mutations. It has been suggested that different perturbations have congruent effects on development taking place on an epigenetic landscape. This could, however, depend on the molecular mechanism responsible for robustness, and be different in different cases. Evolutionary capacitance The canalisation metaphor suggests that some phenotypic traits are very robust to small perturbations, for which development does not exit the canal, and rapidly returns down, with little effect on the final outcome of development. But perturbations whose magnitude exceeds a certain threshold will break out of the canal, moving the developmental process into uncharted territory. For instance, the study of an allelic series for Fgf8, an important gene for craniofacial development, with decreasing levels of gene expression demonstrated that the phenotype remains canalised as long as the expression level is above 40% of the wild-type expression. Strong robustness up to a limit, with little robustness beyond, is a pattern that could increase evolvability in a fluctuating environment. Canalisation of a large set of genotypes into a limited phenotypic space has been suggested as a mechanism for the accumulation, in a neutral manner, of mutations that could otherwise be deleterious. Genetic canalisation could allow for evolutionary capacitance, where genetic diversity accumulates in a population over time, sheltered from natural selection because it does not normally affect phenotypes. This hidden diversity could then be unleashed by extreme changes in the environment or by molecular switches, releasing previously cryptic genetic variation that can then contribute to a rapid burst of evolution, a phenomenon termed decanalisation. Cycles of canalization- decanalization could explain the alternating periods of stasis, where genotypic diversity accumulates without morphological changes, followed by rapid morphological changes, where decanalization releases the phenotypic diversity and becomes subject to natural selection, in the fossil record, thus providing a potential developmental explanation for the punctuated equilibrium.  HSP90 and decanalisation  In 1998, Susan Lindquist discovered that Drosophila hsp83 heterozygous mutants exhibit a large diversity of phenotypes (from sexual combs on the head, to scutoid-like and notched wings phenotypes). She showed that these phenotypes could be passed on to the next generation, suggesting a genetic basis for those phenotypes. The authors hypothesized that Hsp90 (the gene mutated in hsp83), as a chaperone protein, plays a pivotal role in the folding and activation of many proteins involved in developmental signaling pathways, thus buffering against genetic variation in those pathways. hsp83 mutants would therefore release the cryptic genetic variation, resulting in a diversity of phenotypes. In 2002, Lindquist showed that pharmacological inhibition of HSP90 in Arabidopsis thaliana also lead to a wide range of phenotypes, some of which could be considered adaptive, further supporting the canalising role of HSP90. Finally, the same type of experiment in the cavefish Astyanax mexicanus yielded similar results. This species encompasses two populations: an eyed population living under the water surface and an eye-less blind population living in caves. Not only is the cave population eye-less but it also displays a largely reduced orbit size. HSP90 inhibition leads to an increased variation in orbit size that could explain how this trait could evolve in just a few generations. Further analysis showed that low conductivity in the cave water induces a stress response mimicking the inhibition of HSP90, providing a mechanism for decanalisation. It is worth noting that interpretation of the original Drosophila paper is now subject to controversy. Molecular analysis of the hsp83 mutant showed that HSP90 is required for piRNA biogenesis, a set of small RNAs repressing transposons in the germline. Mutation in this gene results in massive transposon insertional mutagenesis that could explain the phenotypic diversification.

A typical outline of the medical education pathway is presented here. However training schemes vary and different pathways may be available. Medical school=Assessments Like many other university degrees, UK medical schools design and deliver their own in-house assessments. This practice is different from, for example, the United States, where a national licensing examination has been in place for over 20 years. Each UK undergraduate summative assessment in medicine is subject to the scrutiny of a formally appointed external examiner. In 2003 a number of UK medical schools began to work together to increase quality assurance activities in the area of assessment as part of the Universities Medical Assessment Partnership (UMAP). UMAP is a collaborative item banking project seeking to build a quality assured written assessment item bank suitable for high-stakes examinations at all UK medical schools. Qualities assurance of the undergraduate medical education The UK General Medical Council (GMC) has the ability to reverse its endorsement of any medical undergraduate training course as part of its regular visiting schedule should a course fall short of the expected standards. Due to the UK code for higher education, first degrees in medicine comprise an integrated programme of study and professional practice spanning several levels. The final outcomes of the qualifications typically meet the expectations of a higher education qualification at level 7 (the UK Master's degree). These degrees may retain, for historical reasons, \\"Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery\\" and are abbreviated to MBChB or MBBS.The UK quality code for higher education Specialty training and postgraduate studies Following completion of medical school, junior doctors then enter a vocational training phase. In the UK a doctor's training normally follows this path: Newly qualified doctors enter a two-year Foundation Programme, where they undertake terms in a variety of different specialities. These must include training in General Medicine and General Surgery but can also include other fields such as Paediatrics, Anaesthetics or General Practice. Following completion of the Foundation Programme a doctor can choose to specialise in one field. All routes involve further assessment and examinations. To train as a general practitioner (GP), after completing the Foundation Programme, a doctor must complete eighteen months of posts in a variety of hospital specialities - often including paediatrics, psychiatry, geriatrics and obstetrics & gynaecology. The trainee also has to spend eighteen months as a General Practice Speciality Registrar - a trainee based in a GP practice. After completing this training and the relevant exams, the doctor can become a GP and can practise independently. Hospital doctors are promoted after sitting relevant postgraduate exams within their chosen speciality (e.g. Member of the Royal College of Physicians MRCP, Member of the Royal College of Surgeons MRCS) and a competitive interview selection process from SHO to Specialty Registrar (StR) and eventually Consultant on completion of the CCT (Certificate of Completion of Training), which is the highest level in a speciality (with the exception of university-linked professors). The competition is significant for those who wish to attain consultant level and many now complete higher degrees in research such as a Doctorate of Medicine (MD), which is a thesis-based award based on at least two years full-time research; or PhD, which involves at least three years of full-time research. The time taken to get from medical school graduation to becoming a consultant varies from speciality to speciality but can be anything from 7 to more than 10 years. In the United Kingdom, doctors' training will rapidly evolve in the next twelve months, with the introduction of run-through training. A doctor, after completing their two foundation years, will apply for a single speciality (including general practice) and be trained solely in that speciality for a fixed period of years (typically seven) before being awarded a CCT. These changes will take place in accordance with the government- instituted plan for Modernising Medical Careers. NHS medical career gradesContinuing medical education Continuing medical education is now mandatory for all doctors, under guidelines from the General Medical Council and Clinical governance.

A total of 400 cars were built, arranged as single units. Two versions were manufactured: Westinghouse (WH)-powered cars and General Electric (GE)-powered cars. The first R17s entered service on October 10, 1955. Originally painted maroon red, the R17s subsequently received several different paint schemes, including bright red, platinum mist/blue, or plain white. The R17s were replaced by the R62As in the 1980s, and the final train of R17s ran on February 29, 1988. Some R17 cars were saved for various purposes, but most were scrapped. Description The R17s were numbered 6500‚Äì6899. They were one of three car classes purchased in the mid-1950s by the New York City Transit Authority to replace much of the pre-World War II IRT High-Voltage (Hi-V) rolling stock, which included the Gibbs cars, the Deck Roofs, and the Hedley Hi-V cars. The cars were single unit cars capable of operating both independently or as part of a longer train. There were two versions of the R17: General Electric-powered cars (6500‚Äì6699) and Westinghouse Electric-powered cars (6700‚Äì6899).Gene Sansone, New York Subways: An Illustrated History of New York City's Transit Cars, , pp. 203 - 210 Cars 6800‚Äì6809 were factory equipped with air conditioning when delivered. However, the air conditioning experiment was considered a failure, and the cars were refitted with standard axiflow fans between 1962 and 1964. Operator's cab of R17 car 6688 at the Shore Line Trolley Museum As delivered, R17s came with low-running lights and very comfortable foam rubber seats. In 1957, sealed beam headlights were added to the cars. Additionally, vandalism and wear & tear contributed to rapid and frequent damage to the original seats, leading the Transit Authority to replace the seats with hard fiberglass benches similar in feel to the ones in use on New York City subway trains today. While the cars received the fox red paint scheme like other cars that would go on to be later known as \\"Redbirds\\", that nickname was never given to these cars. The only nickname for the R17s was \\"Flat bottoms\\", which was given to the GE-powered cars by shop and operating personnel. The name was derived from the large box underneath the car that contained the switch group, resistor grids, and other propulsion control electrical equipment. Designed to simplify maintenance, in practice, the heavy box proved unwieldy. Resistance grids also generate a good deal of heat and therefore need to be cooled. Typically, this is done automatically on a subway car that uses a DC propulsion system, as the grids are exposed, and the train's natural movement creates a breeze that ventilates and cools the grids. But since the R17's grids were enclosed in the heavy box, ventilation and cooling would be provided by using the spinning rotor of the Motor-generator to act as a fan feeding air into the box. The GE R17s were not the only subway cars with this arrangement. The GE-powered R16s, R21s, and R22s had a similar setup, and therefore the \\"Flat bottom\\" nickname applies to the GE cars in those classes as well for the same reason as above. The nickname never applied to the Westinghouse cars in either class. The GE cars built and delivered after the R22s have eliminated this unfortunate system, and reverted back to the former exterior-mounted grids that are exposed as the train's natural movement creates a breeze that ventilates and cooled the grids starting with the R26s cars in 1959. The major identifying characteristics of the R17 can all be found in its windows. These include the circular windows on the car end doors, similar to those found on the R15 and the B Division R11 and R16. The R17 also features large, rounded rectangle windows on its side doors, similar to those found on nearly every car in today's subway system. While similar to the R16 in outward appearance, as an A Division car, it is smaller and contains only three doors on each side of the car (instead of four). Side windows are of a two-pane, pull-down drop sash type (used until the Main Line R36s). The R17, like many older New York City Subway cars built for the A Division, also features two sets of mid-car body passenger windows on each side. Normally arranged in two pairs of three on the R15, on the R17, one set of windows on each side contains a rollsign in lieu of a third window. The sign contains three readings arranged vertically on its box ‚Äì the top two being the train's terminals, and the bottom being the train's route. This window and signbox pattern, first appearing on the R16, became the blueprint for the later R21 and R22, the Redbirds, and even influenced the design of trains still in service today.  History  The first train of R17s was placed in service on the train on October 10, 1955. All 400 cars were delivered by January 1956. On November 1, 1962, fifty R17s (#s 6500‚Äì6549) were transferred from the Mainline IRT to the 7, allowing for ten-car operation on that route. The R17s were delivered in a maroon paint scheme. Some were repainted bright red (\\"tartar red\\") in the late 1960s. All cars received the TA platinum mist/blue paint job starting in 1970. In the early 1980s, they were painted plain white, and eventually, 16 cars were repainted fox red for 42nd Street Shuttle service in 1985‚Äì86. All 16 of the fox red cars were sent to the Flushing Line to fill in for the R33 singles while they were being overhauled. The red R17s were the last to remain in service, running on the train and being mixed with both rebuilt and unrebuilt R26‚ÄìR33 cars. During the course of their careers, two cars (6673 and 6786) were wrecked in 1957 as a result of a collision near Zerega Avenue, and three cars (6595, 6597, and 6601), along with 7740, and the automated shuttle train car numbers 7509, 7513 & 7516 were all destroyed by this fire ‚Äì at the 42nd Street Shuttle fire at Grand Central on April 21, 1964. Retirement 6895 (renumbered to 36895) at the Concourse Yard, awaiting scrapping The R17s were replaced by the R62As, as they had reached the end of their planned service lives. The final train of R17s ran on February 29, 1988 (as a solid consist of R17s) in 5 train service. The majority of the remainder of the fleet was scrapped, but some R17 cars were saved for various purposes throughout the New York City Subway system, including: *Car 6609 ‚Äì restored in 1976 and displayed at the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn. It is fully operational and runs periodically on museum- sponsored \\"Nostalgia Trains\\", specifically on the Train of Many Colors. *Car 6688 ‚Äì preserved at the Shore Line Trolley Museum in East Haven, Connecticut. It is fully operational, though modified with trolley poles, and runs frequently during the summer months for rapid transit themed programming. In May 2017, this car was repainted into the MTA Blue & Silver paint scheme. *Cars 6835 and 6899 survive as work cars, converted to R71 hose reach cars, and overhauled under the R159 program.http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/R-71_Reach_Cars Car 6895 (renumbered to 36895) is currently in storage at Concourse Yard with R21 7267 (renumbered G7267) and has not moved since 2002. This car is still classified as a work car and was used on a special trip sometime during the 1990s. Although it was reported that the cars may be operational and preserved, the car was stripped of parts in 2009 (such as sash windows and rollsigns). Both cars still remain, but are awaiting scrapping.R17 in Concourse Yard http://nycsubway.org/perl/show?57790 Cars 6813 and 6850 were converted to R123 continuous welded rail holder cars for set DCR and overhauled under the R128 program.

At that time, the cars were painted in the MTA platinum mist/blue band livery. R17s can be seen on the 42nd Street Shuttle in Ron Howard's Night Shift (1982). White painted (though clean) R17s on the Shuttle appear in a scene of Mike Nichols' Heartburn (1986) with Meryl Streep and Kevin Spacey, with cars 6699 and 6550. The shuttle platform at Grand Central was doubling for the Christopher Street Station on the 1. The interior of a repainted red R17 operating on the 5 train can be briefly seen in the opening credits of Oliver Stone's Wall Street (1987). A decommissioned R17 is featured in the film Mimic as the escape vehicle for the film's protagonists. Car 6688, which belongs to the Shore Line Trolley Museum, appears in the 2014 film The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

Associated with this diversity of habitat are several species of plant and insect which are uncommon in the London area. Wildlife Essex skipper butterfly The marshes contain several species of insect with a restricted distribution in the London area such as the Essex skipper butterfly Thymelicus lineola, an uncommon Parasite fly Ligeria angusticornis, a pyralid moth Shoeribius micronellus and the sporadic breeding by the nationally endangered marsh warbler. The breeding bird community contains several species typically associated with marshland habitats such as reed bunting, and reed, sedge and willow warblers. A variety of wintering birds visit the marshes and neighbouring reservoirs while in autumn flocks of finches are to be found feeding on the seeds of the tall herbs. Split Leaf Northern half of Split Leaf Split Leaf, a sculpture by Jon Mills, marks the formal entrance to the marshes. The sculpture was made in spring 2003 by Jon Mills in conjunction with pupils from Coppermill Primary School and Mission Grove Primary School, as part of the \\"Take pART\\" programme. It was intended to form a gateway to the park and to the marshes beyond.

It was designed in the Moorish style of the great Spanish cities and included a large courtyard and fountain. The interior was lavishly appointed with red carpet, gold trim, and large pillars. It was located directly beyond the eastern terminus of K Street at 1025 Thirty-First Street, now Alhambra Boulevard, Sacramento, California 95816, in the East Sacramento neighborhood. The theatre was designed by Starks and Flanders, a firm which was founded in Sacramento by New Yorker Leonard Starks in 1922 and designed many other important structures, including the Fox- Senator Theatre, the Elks Building, C. K. McClatchy High School, and the downtown post office. The theatre was also home to the Alhambra Pipe Organ, an organ of fifteen ranks built by the Robert Morton Organ Company in 1927. After it was removed in 1960, the instrument was used by the First Baptist Church in Stockton and now resides with the Kautz family at Ironstone Vineyards.www.theatreorgans.com In 1973, a bond measure intended to allow the City of Sacramento to purchase the theatre failed to pass, and the Alhambra was demolished to make way for a Safeway supermarket. An original fountain is still intact and functioning on the south side of the Safeway parking lot.

These cars were one of the two car types to be rebuilt by the BMT from BU cars, the other being the Q-types. Description and history The C-types were numbered 1500‚Äì1529 A-B-C. Each C-type unit contained 3 cars semi- permanently coupled to form an operating unit. They consisted of a relatively modern steel-framed motor car at each end, originally built in 1903 (former 1200 series car) or 1907 (former 1400 series car) and a steam-era trailer car in the middle, originally built in 1893 (former 100 series car). All of the conversions were done in the shops of the BRT. The conversion was done in order to create a fleet of elevated cars with automatic door controls capable of operating on the BMT Fulton Street Line, whose station platforms had been redone to accommodate -wide equipment instead of the standard -wide elevated cars. The gates and platforms at the ends of each three-car unit were enclosed and a motorman's cab placed in each. The interior gates and platforms of individual cars were removed, and passageways were created between the cars in each unit so passengers could walk from car to car without going outside. Two doorways were cut into each side of each car of the unit, and outside-hung sliding doors were attached to the cars. Despite the C-type's general appearance and the passageways between cars, they were not articulated units, since each car of the unit could stand alone on its own two trucks, while articulated units share trucks underneath the inter-car passageway. The prototypes of the C-type units, created in 1923, presented a fairly neat appearance. However, the production cars created in 1925, with their varying roof heights, floor extensions to reach the platforms, and roof extensions to contain the hangers for the sliding doors presented such an ungainly appearance that they have been popularly characterized as the ugliest equipment ever to run on the New York City subway system. These cars were nicknamed the \\"ugly ducklings\\" because of their appearance. Despite criticism, many of the C-types remained in passenger service until 1956, when the last original portions of the Fulton Street elevated were abandoned and later demolished.

Black exchanges their pawn on c5 for White's pawn on d4, and then places pawns on the squares a6, b6, d6, and e6. These pawns form a row of \\"spines\\" behind which Black their forces. Typically, the bishops are placed on b7 and e7, knights on d7 and f6, queen on c7, and rooks on c8 and e8 (or c8 and d8). Although Black's position is cramped, it has great latent energy, which may be released if Black is able to play ...b5 or ...d5 at some point. These pawn breaks are particularly effective because White usually places their own pawns on c4 and e4 (the Mar√≥czy Bind). Black manoeuvring Once the basic Hedgehog structure is in place, and depending on how White responds, Black has various ways of reorganizing their pieces. The knight on d7 often hops to c5, where it attacks a white pawn on e4; or to e5, where it attacks a pawn on c4. The knight on f6 can go to e8 (when Black placed their rook on d8) to defend the d6 pawn, or to d7 or even to h5, if unoccupied. The black queen can be moved to b8 (unmasking the rook on c8 and perhaps supporting ...b5) or a8 (eyeing d5). A rook placed on d8 serves to defend the d6-pawn and support its push to d5. Sometimes Black plays ...Bf8, ...g6, and ...Bg7 (or more simply ...Bf6 if f6 is vacant) to exert some influence over d4. Or the same bishop can be brought to c7 (via d8) to target White's (in conjunction with a queen on b8). There are also situations where Black can create a kingside attack, by playing ...Kh8, ...Rg8, and ...g5, often followed by doubling rooks on the g-file and pushing the g-pawn to g4. Traditional chess strategy would have frowned upon Black's setup, since their pieces have little room in which to manoeuvre. In the early 1970s, hedgehog' was a generic term for any setup that was cramped, defensive and difficult to attack\\", but today refers specifically to this formation. The Hedgehog first became extensively analysed in the 1970s, when players began to appreciate the rich variety of strategic ideas that arose from it. While Black's position is cramped, it is also relatively free of weaknesses. There is no obvious way for White to attack Black's pawn structure, but as outlined above, Black has several methods at their disposal for creating . Thus the Hedgehog has retained its popularity as a system of development in modern praxis. Early history The ideas behind the Hedgehog were originally developed in the English Opening. The Hedgehog Defence, in particular, refers to a variation in the Symmetrical English (1.c4 c5) where Black adopts this setup: 1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 b6 4.Bg2 Bb7 5.Nc3 e6 6.0-0 Be7 7.d4 cxd4 8.Qxd4 d6. Other openings where Black often uses the setup include the Queen's Indian Defence, and the Taimanov and Kan Variations of the Sicilian Defence. It is also possible for White to adopt a Hedgehog setup, but this happens more rarely. This did occur, however, in Fischer-Andersson, Siegen 1970, one of the first games to feature this method of development. Fischer's crushing victory in this game, in which the Kh1/Rg1/g4 method of attack was vividly demonstrated, so impressed Andersson that he later became one of the foremost Hedgehog exponents himself, for example Karpov-Andersson, Milan 1975.

They were operated by the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) and its successors, which included the New York City Board of Transportation and the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA). The fleet consisted of 121 cars, each arranged as three-section articulated units. Four units were built as a prototype in 1925, and the production units were built during 1927 and 1928. The D-types were the first articulated rapid transit rolling stock used in the United States, and were followed by several more articulated trains until the BMT sold all of its transit operations to the City on June 1, 1940. First placed into service in 1925, they operated primarily on the BMT's Southern Division, although they would also appear on many other parts of the subway system. The R27s, R30s and R32s slowly replaced the triplex cars, which last ran on July 23, 1965. Three sets were preserved, and the rest were scrapped. History The \\"D\\"s were purchased by the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation specifically to augment the service provided by the BMT/BRT A/B Standards. They were used over the years in Southern Division lines based at Coney Island. This permitted several of the A/B units used in these services to be transferred to East New York, and in turn, permitted the removal of the last BU wooden el cars from service in the BMT Nassau Street Line. Other service improvements included the extension of various lines ‚Äî the BMT Fourth Avenue Line one station from 86th Street to Bay Ridge‚Äì95th Street and the BMT Canarsie Line from Montrose Avenue to a connection at East New York with the other lines operating out of that point. In addition, most stations along the Southern Division lines were being extended to permit operation of maximum length trains ‚Äì 8 car \\"A/B\\"s or 4 unit \\"D\\"s. They were originally placed in service on the Fourth Avenue Local running from 95th Street to Queensboro Plaza, with some additional units used on the Brighton Local. This was undoubtedly done to provide maximum exposure for these cars; however, in September 1928, before the entire fleet of 121 units had been delivered, the units serving in Fourth Avenue Local service were transferred to the Sea Beach Express, where, as heavyweight cars with a slow acceleration but very fast overall speed, it was felt that they could provide better service. In 1932, full length trains of these units began operating with only one conductor aside from the motorman. The first major change of assignment for these cars came on April 27, 1950, when the units on the Brighton Local were transferred to Brighton Express service. The BMT Astoria Line's platforms were still under construction, and parts of the platforms were still closed to passengers, requiring trains to use two conductors when traveling on that line. As the A/B trains still used two conductors until September 1958, this move served to save on crews, although \\"D\\"s continued to be used on certain fixed intervals on the Brighton Local until December 1, 1955, and sporadically after that date. On May 27‚Äì28, 1959, the Brighton Express now became virtually all D-Type (except once again for certain fixed intervals which used \\"A/B\\"s), with the Sea Beach Express for the first time in nearly 31 years seeing the usage of A/B-Types along with the D-Types that were still used. With the drastic reduction in West End service that took place at this time, it was decided to run all Sea Beach trains at maximum length 8 cars. The Brighton Express, in the meantime, continued to run a fluctuating 6 or 8 car service during the course of the day, which required much coupling and cutting of trains. As the D-Types were better suited for this purpose, having a much more advanced type of coupler, it was decided to keep these cars for that purpose on the Brighton Express, where they served virtually until the end of their lives. A further change came over the days April 13‚Äì15, 1963, when the units used on the Sea Beach Express were transferred to the West End Express as well as the various Nassau Street services as needed. As these cars were approaching their last days and were now seen as oddball types, it was decided to cut their mileage as much as possible to simplify maintenance procedures; moreover, by June of that year, they began to reappear on the Sea Beach Express once again along with the above. This was undoubtedly to dissipate the mileage on them even further. The oft-stated concern of their weight being too heavy for the Manhattan Bridge was apparently not a factor, as they could be seen in service on the Bridge to the very end of their lives. Over their entire lifetime, they had appeared in all Southern Division services at one time or other, including all Nassau Street services, weekend Franklin Avenue Local service to Brighton Beach, Culver Shuttle, and also to Astoria and via the 60th Street Tunnel Connection and over the IND Queens Boulevard Line to Forest Hills (during the 1957 motormen's strike, some units ran over this line to 179th Street). The units had a reputation with the BMT and subsequent operating agencies for being especially reliable, requiring minimal maintaining and experiencing fewer breakdowns than other New York subway equipment. Retirement The R27s, R30s, and R32s slowly replaced the triplex cars. The last units were retired from service on July 23, 1965, with the last train in service having operated as a West End Local in the A.M. rush on that date. D-type sets 6019, 6095, and 6112 are preserved by the New York Transit Museum. These cars operated on various fan trips until 2004, when, in the 2004 \\"Parade of Trains\\", wheelslip heavily damaged the motors of one set. Unable to operate on its own power, the train was towed to Coney Island Yard. Set 6095 resided in the New York Transit Museum, while sets 6019 and 6112 were stored at Coney Island Yard. These sets were transferred to Pitkin Yard when it was discovered that the cars had severe corrosion damage. In 2015, sets 6095 and 6112 received mechanical and cosmetic work at the 207th Street Yard and have been operational on fan trips since late June 2015. Set 6019 currently remains out of service. Technical notes Among the innovations of the \\"D\\"s were the first New York rolling stock to include front destination signs with a route designation. These signs introduced the route numbering to the BMT system. The numbers started to be replaced in 1960 with the current letters on all subsequent equipment to be delivered. They also featured inside the cars a sign box, which included large dual destination signs that could be keyed by the train operator to light up in the direction the train was traveling. There were also lighted signs to indicate whether a train was traveling via the Montague Street Tunnel or the Manhattan Bridge. The D-type is articulated, consisting of three car body sections, sequentially labeled A, B, and C carried on four trucks. All four trucks are powered by one motor each. Two trucks are placed on kingpins near the ends of the A and C sections and don't have contact shoes. The other two trucks are placed beneath each of the articulation drums that attach the center B section to the A and C sections. These trucks have contact shoes. The wheel diameter varies with the type of axle: the motor axle wheels are in diameter, while the trailer axle wheels are just in diameter. The D-types were the first articulated rapid transit rolling stock used in the United States, with all subsequent rapid transit equipment ordered by the BMT, both production and experimental, being articulated units.

The gospel's author is revealed to be Matthias, whom the Book of Acts describes as Judas's replacement. The fictional Gospel of Matthias's descriptions of first-century Christianity are not always edifying, but often wittily call to mind contemporary religious movements. The fictional gospel revolves around whether, after his crucifixion, Jesus's body was smuggled to Egypt and mummified. However, the question remains unanswered in the end.

The Composite derived its name from its build as a \\"protected wooden car\\". The car frame was made of steel, while the car body itself was made from wood encased in a layer of copper sheathing. The copper skin was intended to protect the car in the event of a fire in the subway. Therefore, the result was a body composed of several materials (as in a Composite material) and became known simply as a \\"Composite\\". Background The first IRT subway in New York would prove to be the first attempt at an underground heavy rail subway. For example, the underground portion of Boston's Green Line, which opened in 1897, had been light rail. Therefore, the IRT and its chief engineer George Gibbs felt compelled to develop a subway car that would be stronger and safer than any previously designed railway cars. This inevitably led them to the conclusion that it would be best to design an all-steel car to run in the new tunnels. However, car manufacturers of the time were unwilling to undertake such an experimental proposition. Steel was deemed too heavy for any practical applications. The conventional wisdom of the day (since proven to be false) held that an all-steel car would vibrate itself to pieces, claiming wood was \\"necessary\\" for its damping effects on the car's vibration. It was also widely believed that a steel car would be very loud, and poorly insulated from temperature extremes such as heat and cold. With a large backlog of orders for wooden cars, manufacturers had no incentive to explore the new technology as there was still plenty of demand for wooden railcars. The IRT knew that the October 27, 1904 opening of the new subway route was fast approaching and that rolling stock had to be designed and built soon or the line would not be ready. With time running short to order rolling stock, a wood-based alternative had been proposed ‚Äì a protected wooden car to be known as a Composite. Prototype construction 1902 Scientific American photograph of the IRT Composite Prototypes. August Belmont is in the foreground, while John B. McDonald is visible in the distance. Engineering work began on the protected wooden cars, and two Composite prototypes were ordered from Wason in 1902. They were originally numbered 1 and 2, and named the August Belmont (after the president of the IRT) and the John B. McDonald (after the first subway's contractor), respectively. Each was designed to sample different features and amenities ‚Äì the Belmont explored the possibility of offering a \\"first class\\" service (which never materialized), while the McDonald tested a layout intended to be more standard. After thorough evaluation of all features of both prototype cars, it was time to decide on a design for the Composites to be ordered for the subway. All engineering work on the cars was finally completed during 1902, and orders were placed with four manufacturers for 500 cars shortly thereafter. The IRT was not finished visiting the all-steel car idea, however. In 1903, George Gibbs used his influence to contract with the Pennsylvania Railroad's shops in Altoona to build an all-steel prototype for the new subway. The all-steel prototype would serve as the inspiration for the Gibbs Hi-V cars, so named after George Gibbs, who had done so much to see to their creation. Along with similar all-steel equipment that arrived later, the Gibbs cars would eventually phase the Composites out of subway service. Meanwhile, as the effort to design a steel car continued in 1903, the IRT awaited the arrival of the Composites. Service history=Prototypes The two Composite prototypes (cars 1 and 2 ‚Äì the August Belmont and John B. McDonald) never saw passenger service in the tunnels of the IRT subway. They were renumbered 3340 and 3341 respectively, in 1903. August Belmont became an instruction car, while John B. McDonald was used to distribute payroll to employees until 1917. In 1917, one year after the production fleet of Composite cars had been converted for service on the elevated division, the prototype John B. McDonald was also converted and added to the elevated fleet where it ran alongside the rest of the Composite cars. Following retirement, both Composite prototypes were also scrapped. Production cars The mainline fleet of Composites began arriving in New York as early as 1903 and was tested on the IRT's elevated lines shortly thereafter as work continued on the IRT subway. They proved suitable for use. Along with the Gibbs Hi-Vs, the Composites were part of the original IRT fleet, which ran along New York City's first subway route (the IRT Manhattan Mainline) beginning October 27, 1904. The cars proved serviceable and continued onward in service from that point. Not counting the two Composite prototypes, the IRT received 500 Composites: 340 motor cars and 160 trailers. Estimates by IRT engineers required a 3:1 ratio of motor cars to trailer cars. Therefore, when the 300 Gibbs Hi-V motors were added to these numbers, the new totals were 640 motor cars and 160 trailers. This was a surplus of motor cars. Shortly after delivery, therefore, the IRT began converting motor cars into trailers. As all Gibbs Hi-V cars were motors, the preference was to keep them that way while converting more Composite motors into trailers. By 1910, 208 of the 340 motorized Composite cars had been converted into trailers. By 1909, it was determined that improvements needed to be made to the fleet. Since the design of the Composites was heavily influenced by both elevated equipment and railroad coaches of the time, the cars featured only two doors at the extreme ends of the subway car. It was determined that adding a center door for improved passenger flow would be a good idea. This required removing the transverse seats, which faced each other in the center of the car. After the modification, passenger seating would be in the longitudinal direction (along the sides of the car) only. This created more room for standees. This modification was completed on the cars by 1912. Despite their copper sheathing, it was found that the subway cars were not that well \\"protected\\" from fire for service in the subway, as 23 Composites had been retired from service due to fire or minor accidents by 1916. They were outlawed from the subway by order of the Public Service Commission. In addition, since subsequent car orders for the IRT were all-steel, concerns had grown about the effects of running the wooden equipment alongside steel equipment, should a collision occur. Thankfully, one never did, save for a test done to see how the cars would fare. The Composite was badly crushed while the all-steel car suffered considerably less damage, proving the superior strength of the steel cars. As a result of these two fears ‚Äì fire and collision ‚Äì the 477 remaining Composites were transferred during 1916 to serve on the elevated division of the IRT. Doing so also meant modifying their weight accordingly so as to reduce the stress on the weaker elevated structures. On January 17, 1916, the first elevated trains of Composite cars were in service on the IRT Third Avenue and Second Avenue Lines, sharing tracks with the subway. Because of their added weight even with the lighter trucks, the Composites had to run without passengers in the anti-peak direction of their rush hour trips. The entire Composite car fleet had been transferred to the elevated lines in Manhattan by December of 1916. The Composites remained on the elevated until their retirement in 1950. Following their retirement, all of the Composite cars were scrapped by 1953. Description=Design Because of the concerns over wooden construction, the Composites employed a number of vintage, turn-of-the-20th-century mechanisms to reduce the risk of fire. Most commonly, this involved the use of asbestos, electrobestos, or the asbestos-containing material transite. Since the adverse health effects of such were not yet fully known nor understood, asbestos was present in numerous locations throughout the car, most notably under the floors, and around any electrical wiring. All of the undercar electrical equipment was housed in steel boxes. Steel and wood were used to complement each other and give rigidity to the body by strengthening the frame. However, the side paneling of the car remained wood. But as an added fireproofing measure, the wood siding would be encased in a layer of copper sheathing that ran halfway up the side of the car. Because of the Composites' copper sheathing, IRT crews and shop personnel coined the nickname for the cars: Copper Sides. Interior 250px As originally delivered, the cars came only with two doors on each side of the car, located at the end vestibules. The original seating configuration was what was known as \\"Manhattan Style\\", a name given because the seating arrangement originated on the cars that ran on the Manhattan Elevated during the 19th century. \\"Manhattan Style\\" seating featured eight transverse seats in the center of the car facing each other, and longitudinal benches down the sides of the remainder of the car. No seating was provided in end vestibules as they were primarily for entrance and exit, and to accommodate standees. Each end vestibule was accessible at all times except for the ones at the very front and very rear of a train, which were closed off by sliding vestibule doors to block entry. Because of this layout, crowd conditions were a true New York spectacle. IRT ridership and crowding conditions exceeded the expectations of the IRT's engineers. Exit was difficult, with riders needing to access the car's extremities for a pathway out of the car via the vestibule. Entering riders had to wait while exiting riders alighted from the train before they could begin a longboarding process. Consequently, the most prudent course of action was determined to be adding center doors to each Composite car. This modification took place from 1909‚Äì1912. Adding a center door to the car body, however, directly conflicted with the Manhattan style seating, so the center transverse seats had to be removed for these modifications. The car body had also not been designed with the strength necessary to support a center door, so when this modification was made, it was necessary to add fishbelly girders underneath the center doors to provide added strength for the car's frame. The cars as delivered featured rattan seats and incandescent lighting, staples of most pre-WWII subway cars in New York City. All areas of the cars were lit, as bulbs were placed along the center roofline and down the sides of each car's interior. Additionally, pairs of bulbs on each end lit each end vestibule. As delivered, they did not come with fans, however, windows and clerestory vents along the upper roof could be opened for ventilation. All windows were drop sash type (rather than rising sash type) for improved safety and to reduce the amount of draught in moving cars. Floors were made of wood (maple), and grab holds were provided along the roof for standees. Originally, these grab holds were made of leather (as on elevated trains), and later replaced with the steel grab holds that were IRT standard for many years. As originally delivered, the cars featured manual \\"Armstrong\\" doors, a reference to the \\"strong arm\\" that would be needed by trainmen to open them. Near each door, a large lever could be thrown by trainmen to open or close the doors. This meant that each train of Composites required a number of trainmen to operate doors at each station stop. Route destinations and service patterns were indicated to riders by means of steel signs placed in holders along the side of the cars, near the doors. These signs could be physically removed and changed when a train was assigned to a different service pattern. Marker lights at the front and rear of each car also indicated the routes to crews en route, as well as astute riders who came to recognize their trains' marker light patterns over time. Tunnel lighting was accomplished by means of kerosene lanterns hung on the front and rear of each train. Red was to be displayed in the rear of the train, and white was to be displayed at the front. At each terminal turnaround, lanterns would be changed to reflect the train's new direction of travel. Kerosene lamps were chosen because of their reliability. Even in the event of failure of subway third rail power, the kerosene lamps would remain lit. Propulsion All of the cars, as originally built, featured high voltage propulsion control equipment, which sent 600 volts through the motorman's control stand as well as through the train via the use of jumpers between cars. This had to be the case to make the electrical contacts to allow all of the motor cars of a train to draw power in a synchronized effort from the Third rail. However, this could be dangerous for motormen and shop personnel alike by creating an electrocution hazard. Even unpowered trailer cars had to carry the 600 volts through these jumpers because it was necessary to pass on the voltage to motor cars behind the trailer so as to synchronize them with the lead car. Motors, manufactured either by Westinghouse or General Electric, were 200 horsepower each. Each motor car was equipped with two motors. Additionally, like all of the old high voltage equipment, the cars featured a ten point brass controller with manual acceleration, which required motormen to notch up gradually as the train came up to speed. Should a motorman advance too quickly with the controller handle, however, a device would actually prevent the car's propulsion system from notching up at too rapid a rate. Mounted on the top of the controller handle was a button, which had to be depressed at all times acting as a deadman's switch, which would automatically apply the train's emergency brakes should the motorman let go. This was a safety feature designed to stop a train should a motorman become incapacitated. Variations of a deadman's switch, or deadman's device, have been used continuously since and are still used on all current New York City Subway rolling stock. When it had been determined to transfer the Composites to the elevated division of the IRT in 1916, several changes were made to the equipment. As subway cars, the Composite motor cars were simply too heavy to run on elevated structures. Therefore, they were lightened. The trucks were replaced with the lighter elevated type, and smaller, less powerful motors (120 hp instead of 200 hp) were installed. As mentioned above, by 1916, 208 of the motorized Composites had already been converted into trailers. When the IRT looked at this and noted the reduction in power of motor cars associated with using the smaller motors, it decided to convert all Composite trailers to motors in 1916. While this modification added weight to the trailer cars, the load on each wheel was still within the acceptable range to run on elevated structures. Therefore, all Composites became motorized. One other notable change occurred during the 1916 modifications. The high voltage propulsion control was replaced with a safer low voltage propulsion control, which utilized battery voltage (32 volts) to control the train's motors. This battery voltage was what would pass through the motorman's control stand and between cars. Tractive effort throughout the train was synchronized by the battery voltage in this way. Meanwhile, each car would respond individually to the battery voltage, by moving its own 600 volt contacts to direct power obtained locally by each car directly from the third rail toward the motors. Using 32 volts to control the propulsion in this way was a much safer proposition for trainmen and shop personnel than the 600 volts associated with the older high voltage setup. Braking 250pxThe cars, as built, featured an old style of WABCO passenger braking equipment previously used on passenger railroads. The braking schedule was known as AM(P). Originally, it was known as AM, but the 'P' was added later to distinguish the setup from newer AM types like AML. Therefore, for the purposes of this notation, the P has been included in parentheses ‚Äì as in Braking Schedule AM(P) ‚Äì to acknowledge this change. On a train equipped with AM(P), there was no electric synchronization of braking throughout a train, so a braking effort took a few seconds to apply or release uniformly throughout a train as different cars reacted to the brake request (which was entirely pneumatic) at different times. Additionally, an operator could not partially reduce his braking effort so as to smooth out stops or correct if he had undershot the mark (a feature known as a graduated release of the brakes). The AM(P) setup required the train to fully release the brakes before they could be applied again. This made making precision stops in stations by motormen a real art, but a task that the majority of IRT motormen proved up to. By 1910, an improved braking schedule had been introduced, known as AMRE. This setup and all others to come after, permitted graduated release of the brakes for finer control of brake applications. Additionally, AMRE allowed for the electric synchronization of braking throughout an entire train, causing all brakes on all cars of the train to apply uniformly and simultaneously. This created a smoother braking effort throughout the train. In order for the electric synchronization to work, it was necessary to insert an electric brake key to activate the feature. All of the older IRT cars, including the Composites, were refitted with the new AMRE system circa 1910. When it had been decided to transfer the Composites to the elevated division of the IRT in 1916, the cars' braking was modernized further. In AMRE schedule braking, the electric brake must be activated at all times by the use of the electric brake key to synchronize the train's braking effort electrically. If it was not \\"cut in\\" or failed en route, the system could still be manipulated to apply the brakes pneumatically. This would still allow the train to stop, but deceleration would take longer such as on the older AM(P) schedule braking. However, in AMRE, the notches in the brake stand to cause this pneumatic application are completely separate from the notches to cause an electric application. Therefore, if a motorman with a defective or inactive electric AMRE brake were to electrically apply the brakes, nothing would happen. Valuable seconds would be lost while he realized his electric brake was inactive before he could move to the pneumatic apply notch to begin slowing his train down (which would still take longer than usual without electric synchronization of the brakes). In a serious scenario, this could cause him to overshoot a station or an important stopping point, or overspeed. In a new braking schedule known as AMUE, however, the electric and pneumatic notches are joined together on the motorman's brake stand. Therefore, even if the electric brake is defective or inactive, his moving the brake handle to the apply position would still begin setting up a pneumatic application of the brakes, creating a much quicker response to the condition than possible under any other previous system. As part of the modifications for elevated service, the Composites were equipped with AMUE schedule braking from 1916 until their retirement.

Barbotine is the French for ceramic slip, or a mixture of clay and water used for moulding or decorating pottery.Or opne word for it in French engobe is also used in France and in some contexts in America In English the term is used for three different techniques of decorating pottery, though in all cases mainly for historical works. For clarity, these types are numbered here as A-C (which are not standard terms). sprigged decoration A: Piped slip decoration In the first, common from the Ancient World onwards, the barbotine is piped onto the object rather as cakes are decorated with icing, using a quill, horn, or other kind of nozzle. The slip would normally be in a contrasting colour to the rest of the vessel, and forms a pattern, or inscription, that is slightly raised above the main surface. This is normally called slip-trailing in English today, and for English pottery (such as the works of Thomas Toft, d. 1698), but \\"barbotine\\" remains common in archaeology. The first barbotine technique in pottery styling was in use in the ancient world. The Egyptians were known to have used barbotine design. As another example, Middle Minoan pottery from Knossos on the island of Crete in present-day Greece includes a barbotine pottery style, and it is common in Ancient Roman pottery, where the colour may often be the same as the rest of the vessel. B: Slipcast sprigs Type C painted vase by Eug√®ne Schopin, France, late 19th century The second technique is a term for slipcasting, \\"couler en barbotine\\" in French. \\"Barbotine pottery\\" is sometimes used for Ancient Roman as well as 19th-century French and American pottery with added slipcast decoration. Slip or barbotine is cast in moulds to form three-dimensional decorative sections which when dried out are added to the main vessel., explains the second technique Typically, these might be flowers, fruit, or small animals. Again, there is an alternative English term, sprigging, which is normally used for English pottery, for example in Wedgwood's Jasperware, where the sprigs are in contrasting colours. C: Slip- painting The third sense of the term describes a technique developed by Ernest Chaplet, the secret of which was later sold by him to Haviland & Co.. This was a method of painting art pottery in brightly-coloured slips, in French also called peinture √† la barbotine or in gouache vitrifiable. In this type there may be some impasto, but the decoration is essentially close to the surface. The term \\"Barbotine ware\\" also describes the American art pottery that emulated the Haviland pottery, which made a great impression at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition.Ellison, 43-53 In America this led to the technique sometimes being called \\"Limoges ware\\", Haviland being a large maker of Limoges porcelain. In fact all their barbotine wares were made at their factory in Auteuil, near Paris.Ellison, 45 The technique and term were less frequently used in England, although the technique was used, typically for floral paintings, by potteries including the Watcombe Pottery and the Bretby Art Pottery.Bergesen, Victoria, Bergesen's Price Guide: British Ceramics, 237 and 230 respectively, 1992, Barrie & Jenkins, This sense of the term entered English via French potteries such as S√®vres and the Haviland Company of Limoges, who used it to describe their pottery in the second half of the 19th century.

Thompson was recruited in the 1996 AFL Draft at pick no 62 and was picked up from the VAFA club Old Melburnians. At the time of his recruitment Thompson was 24 years of age, relatively old for an AFL footballer to begin his career. Thompson later said that being recruited at a late age allowed him to become more travelled and worldly than other footballers who begin their careers at 17 or 18 years of age. Thompson quickly established himself in the St Kilda line-up in 1997, missing only two games (in Rounds 2 and 3) and playing every game from Round 4 onwards, including St Kilda's loss in the Grand Final. Thompson played in 20 of 22 matches in the 1997 AFL Premiership Season home and away rounds in which St Kilda Football Club qualified in first position for the 1997 AFL Finals Series, winning the club's 2nd Minor Premiership and 1st McClelland Trophy. Thompson was noted for his hard work ethic and consistency and this led to him winning the 1999 Channel 7 Player of the Year Award. His outstanding and consistent form also earned him a Trevor Barker Award for St Kilda's Best and Fairest player in 2000. Despite a dismal year for the Saints, when they finished last, Thompson continued toiling and was a shining light in an otherwise disappointing side. Thompson played in St Kilda's 2004 Wizard Home Loans Cup winning side ‚Äì St Kilda's second AFL Cup win. Thompson signed a one-year contract with the Saints for the 2006 season and was part of a veteran group with Justin Peckett and Stephen Powell who signed on for one last shot at a premiership. He made a solid contribution for the season, and new coach Ross Lyon signed him up for one last time at the beginning of the 2007 year. In his last season, Thompson battled injury and fitness issues, but managed 10 matches for the Saints. He farwelled the football world on 1 September, playing his final game on the MCG against Richmond. Fellow Saint Fraser Gehrig also announced his retirement, and both players were chaired off the ground. Thompson has worked part-time in the finance and business world since 2004.

These cars were nicknamed the Battleships because of their paint scheme where the siding was painted Battleship Grey. When these cars were delivered, they had two doors on each side until the early 1910s, when they received another door in the middle on each side.http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?45157.jpg Just like the Gibbs cars, the Deck Roofs sent 600 volts into the controller, which was hazardous. Otherwise, these cars proved to be reliable throughout their career. In the 1920s, the Hi-V fleet was being converted to multiple unit door control, with the exception of all 50 of the Deck Roofs and some Gibbs and Hedley cars. The Deck Roofs were often placed at either end of the train so that ten car trains of Hi-Vs could run.http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?78236.jpghttp://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?47726.jpg Until the late 1950s and early 1960s, the IRT platforms could not handle a full ten car train. Thus, the manual door controls of the Deck Roof were reliable, as the side vestibule doors at either end of the train can be opened manually even if the entire car isn't on the platform. However, two conductors were required for operation of manual door controlled cars. Retirement When all the platforms on the IRT were eventually lengthened to support ten car trains, the Hi-Vs were being phased out by the then new R17, R21, and R22 subway cars. The last of the Hi-Vs was retired in 1959. Car 3662 is preserved by the Shore Line Trolley Museum, modified with trolley poles.

Neiden, situated along the Neiden River, actually consists of two villages separated by the border of Norway and Finland. One side is in S√∏r-Varanger Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway and the other side is in Inari Municipality in Lapland, Finland. Neiden is the official name in Norway and N√§√§t√§m√∂ in Finland. The European route E6 highway runs through the Norwegian village of Neiden. In Finnish view Neiden/N√§√§t√§m√∂ extends into Finland, and there is a small village in Finland near the border called N√§√§t√§m√∂, with border shops, around 12 km from Neiden village centre. History Neiden became the main settlement of the westernmost (, i.e. the fundamental unit of the old Sami society, indicating both the area and the family group(s) exploiting it) of the Skolts and has remained relatively unchanged, leaving numerous traces of earlier use of the area intact. Neiden was governmentally divided officially in 1852. The reason for that separation was the demarcation treaty between the Kingdom of Sweden-Norway and the Grand Duchy of Finland, which prohibited nomadic reindeer herding and moving of fishermen over the border. That caused much harm to reindeer husbandry for a long time. World War Two On 26 and 27 October 1944 around two hundred soldiers (from the Soviet forces and from the German forces) were killed.M√•tte begrave hundrevis av lik People Most inhabitants of Neiden are Sami, Kven, and Norwegians. Skolt Sami The Skolts form a minority group among the Sami and are distinct from other groups in a number of ways. The Russian culture has had a strong influence on the Skolts, who adopted Christianity in its Eastern Orthodox form in the 16th century. The Skolt Sami language is highly endangered and not spoken actively in Neiden today. Almost all speakers live in Finland. The √Ñ'vv Skolt Sami Museum, situated in Neiden, officially opened in June 2016. A Skolt Sami tradition maintained until today is the so-called K√§p√§l√§-fishing of salmon with a cast net. Protected area The Skolt S√°mi Orthodox Chapel in Neiden The protected area in Skoltebyen includes a number of different monuments, some of which are old enough (i.e. more than 100 years) to be automatically protected under the Cultural Heritage Act. These include a Russian Orthodox graveyard, the ruins of a smoke sauna, sixteen sites of traditional turf huts known as gammer and a tiny () Russian Orthodox chapel, St. Georg's Chapel, build 1565 by Tryphon of Pechenga. In addition, many of the natural features of the area have been and are being used in religious ceremonies, such as baptism. The formal protection (scheduling) of the settlement was carried out in order to safeguard its historical and religious importance as well as the integrity of the landscape. This is the most important cultural heritage site for the Skolts and their surviving culture in Norway. The protection order was issued to prevent the area from being developed in a way that would reduce its significance and cultural value, while at the same time encouraging use that will communicate, maintain and develop the Skolt culture. The protection order does not affect the commercial salmon fishing in the Neiden River nor other commercial activities in the area. Religion The oldest church in Neiden (and in Finnmark) is St. Georg's Russian Orthodox chapel (built 1565), mentioned above. There is also the Lutheran Neiden Chapel, built in 1902 in the classical style of a Norwegian stave church. It was built as part of a deliberate policy of Norwegianization of Eastern Finnmark in the face of fear of Russian encroachment.

It was the first all-steel subway car ordered for New York City. Because of the sliding doors which enclosed the motorman's vestibules from the rest of the car compartment, the cars were nicknamed Merry Widows. Early on, they were also known as Battleships, a reference to their second paint scheme where the siding was painted Battleship Grey. However, the nickname did not stick and was later given to the Deck Roof Hi-V cars, which were painted the same color. Today, references to the \\"Battleships\\" are generally assumed to be in reference to the Deck Roof cars, as opposed to the Gibbs cars. Background information As the Interborough Rapid Transit Company's subway line was the first attempt at an underground rapid transit, the IRT and chief engineer George Gibbs felt compelled to develop a subway car that would be stronger and safer than any previously designed railway cars. This inevitably led them to the conclusion that it would be best to design an all-steel car to run in the new tunnels. However, car manufacturers of the time were unwilling to undertake such an experimental proposition. Steel was deemed too heavy for any practical applications. The conventional wisdom of the day (since proven to be false) held that an all-steel car would vibrate itself to pieces, for wood was \\"necessary\\" for its damping effects on the car's vibration. It was also widely believed that a steel car would be very loud, and poorly insulated from temperature extremes such as heat and cold. With a large backlog of orders for wooden cars, manufacturers had no incentive to explore the new technology as there was still plenty of demand for wooden railcars. The IRT knew that the 1904 opening of the new subway route was fast approaching and that rolling stock had to be designed and built soon or the line would not be ready. With time running short to order rolling stock, a protected wooden alternative known as a Composite had been designed and ordered. But that did not stop Gibbs from his pursuit of an all-steel subway car. The all-steel prototype In 1903, George Gibbs used his influence to contract with the Pennsylvania Railroad's shops in Altoona to build an all-steel prototype for the new subway. This car, numbered 3342, was tested in February 1904 and deemed to be too heavy for practical use in the new subway. It required further design changes before it could become serviceable. But most importantly, the all- steel prototype proved that an all-steel car could be feasible, and validated Gibbs' claims that the previously held fears of excessive vibration, poor insulation, and loud noise were unfounded. IRT engineers began modifying the all-steel design to lighten the cars to a more suitable weight. One of the largest breakthroughs came when engineers learned they could achieve a similar structural strength as the heavier car by constructing a \\"skeleton\\" floor frame made of thick, intersecting steel sills and crossmembers. This was in contrast to using a single thick, heavy sheet of steel for a large center sill that supported the car. Following this and other weight-reducing changes, the IRT was ready to go ahead with a production order of the new \\"Gibbs\\" cars, named after George Gibbs. Larger builders remained steadfast in their refusal to build all-steel cars. However, as a result of the generally successful introduction of the steel prototype car, the growing American Car & Foundry was willing to accept an order for steel cars. Three hundred were to be constructed, incorporating the latest modifications made by Gibbs and IRT engineers to reduce the weight of the cars. Service history Gibbs Hi-Vs were used on the first subway line since 1904 and ran until 1959. Gibbs Hi-V cars were primarily used in local service on the subway until 1952, when an equipment exchange put many of these cars in IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line Express service as well. Cars 3376, 3386, 3447, 3524, 3567, 3591, 3638 were used as work motors. 3342 became a pay car in 1905, while 3350 also became a pay car in 1930. 3342 was scrapped in 1956. All other work cars were retired and scrapped by 1960 as surplus Lo-Vs cars entered work service. Car 3352 has been preserved at the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine, and was restored back to its 1905 appearance. It is modified with trolley poles and in running condition, but the car is not run often.

Its western terminus is an intersection with U.S. Route 441 (US 441 or SR 7) at the border between Miramar and West Park; its eastern terminus is an intersection with South Ocean Drive (SR A1A) on the boundary between Hallandale Beach and Hollywood, just east of the Intracoastal Waterway. SR 858 is the latitudinal baseline for Hallandale Beach's street grid. Route description State Road 858 begins at the eastern end of the intersection between US 441 (State Road 7), with Miramar Parkway to the west and Hallandale Beach Boulevard to the east at the border between Miramar and West Park. SR 858 takes Hallandale Beach Boulevard east into West Park as a mostly commercial road. At 56th Avenue, the road leaves West Park and enters Pembroke Park, continuing in a blend of residential and commercial properties, including mobile homes. SR 858 then has an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95), where to the east of the interchange, SR 858 enters Hallandale Beach, and becomes an almost purely commercial road for the rest of the road. The road then crosses the Dixie Highway and the Florida East Coast Railroad, and then passes by the northern end of the Gulfstream Park Race Track just east of the intersection of South Federal Highway (US 1/SR 5). Between Federal Highway and the eastern terminus, the road passes through several shopping centers, crossing the Intracoastal Waterway on a drawbridge one block west of SR A1A, the eastern terminus of SR 858, one block west of the ocean and just south of Hollywood. West of SR 858's western terminus, the road has a hidden designation of County Road 858, and is known locally as Miramar Parkway, with the entire county road being located in Miramar. The County Road designation extends to the west as a mostly residential road, crossing Florida's Turnpike without an interchange, intersections with University Drive (SR 817) and Red Road (SR 823). The county road designation ends at an interchange with Interstate 75 (SR 93). Miramar Parkway continues an additional westward, until the road ends in a residential development west of Southwest 184th Avenue. History Originally, Hallandale Beach Boulevard was State Road 824, established since the 1945 renumbering, extending from US 441 to SR A1A, and was State Road 394 prior to 1945. It also had an auxiliary road, State Road 824A, 1.2 miles to the north, locally known as Pembroke Road. As part of a statewide reorganization, the Florida Department of Transportation transferred the SR 824 signage to a longer stretch of Pembroke Road and assigned State Road 858 to Hallandale Beach Boulevard (despite SR 852 and SR 854 being to the south). At the same time, the SR 858 designation was transferred from Oil Well Road in Collier County that extended westward from Sunnyland Station on the Collier-Hendry County boundary line. At one point, the entire length of SR 858 was to be upgraded to become the Snake Creek Expressway, but eventually, the plans changed to where the expressway was shifted just south to become the Broward County portion of the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike. While the land along the western two-thirds of Miramar Parkway is in the process of development as the population of southwestern Broward County has been undergoing rapid growth since the late 1980s, the neighborhoods along the eastern part (including CR 858) are now fully constructed as suburban housing, which continues along most of SR 858 west of the Dixie Highway (which had the designation of SR 5A until the 1990s).

This included an ogee-styled roof, a door arrangement similar to those of BMT cars, rollsigns that marked the destination for each train, and a lack of vestibules. Additionally, these cars were single-ended units, with the operator's controls on one end, and the conductor's controls on the opposite end.https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_Interborough_Fleet,_1900-1939_(Composites,_Hi-V,_Low-V)#Low- Voltage_.28Low-V.29 While the cars cosmetically presented a more contemporary and more modern appearance, mechanically and electrically, they were Steinway cars and were compatible with the older Steinways, as they also contained the special gear ratios required to climb the steep grades (4.5%) of the Steinway Tunnels. However, as the World's Fair Lo-V was significantly different, it was a separate and distinct car class and not included in the \\"Steinway\\" grouping. History The World's Fair Lo-Vs began service on the Flushing Line, which was the line closest to the 1939 World's Fair. After the fair closed, they continued to operate on that line until 1950, when they were displaced by the new R12, R14, and R15 subway cars. Afterward, they were sent to the IRT Pelham Line, where they operated until 1956, when they were displaced by the new R17s. They were then assigned to the 7th Ave Bronx Express Line until 1962, when they were deemed surplus by the vast amount of new IRT subway cars being placed into service during this period. Finally, they were transferred to the IRT Third Avenue Line in the Bronx, where they spent their final years until they were replaced by the heavily modified R12s in late 1969. Many cars were converted into work motors with a 3 added in front of their original numbers, but were eventually replaced by retired SMEE cars converted into work cars in the 1990s, and were eventually scrapped.https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Chapter_2,_The_IRT_Subway#Section_H:_The_Last_Cars_Built_For_the_Interborough Car 5655 has been preserved by the New York Transit Museum and restored.

The base was demilitarised in the late 1990s and became a fully civilian airport administered by AENA, the Spanish airports authority. Development since the 2000s The airport has been a Ryanair base since October 2008 although for the winter 2009‚Äì2010 season Ryanair reduced the number of flights and destinations from Reus by a substantial amount. This reduction was only temporary for the winter months, and a full flight programme recommenced late March 2010. On 29 June 2011 Ryanair announced that their base would close on 30 October with the loss of 28 routes after failing to reach an agreement with the local government. Ryanair resumed some flights in March 2012, but they are operated by aircraft not based at Reus. Terminal Aerial view In order to adapt Reus Airport to future air traffic demand, Aena Aeropuertos has carried out a series of improvements and extended its facilities. These include a new check-in building between the arrivals and departures buildings, integrating the three buildings into one. The departures building has also been remodelled for use as a boarding area. The new departures terminal has 23 check-in desks and 12 boarding gates spread over two rooms: gates 1 to 6 are intended for non- Schengen flights, and 7 to 12 are dedicated to Schengen destinations. The public area and the passenger only zone have cafeteria and restaurant services and duty-free shops. Airlines and destinations The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Reus: Statistics In 1995, approximately 500,000 passengers passed through the airport. In 2004 this number more than doubled to 1.1 million and in 2009 the airport reached a peak of 1.7 million. By 2014 this had dropped (-12.4%) to 850,492 passengers.Informes Anuales - 2014 - AENA In 2015 the drop continued to 705,067 passengers (-17,1%). After that the number of passengers has increased a lot to 817,765 passengers in 2016 (+16,0%). In 2017 the airport passed after 6 years again the mark of 1 million passengers. Incidents and accidents * On 20 July 1970, a Condor Boeing 737-100 (registered D-ABEL) which was approaching Reus Airport, collided with a privately owned Piper Cherokee light aircraft (registration EC-BRU) near Tarragona, Spain. The Piper subsequently crashed, resulting in the death of the three persons on board. The Condor Boeing suffered only minor damage, and there were no injuries amongst the 95 passengers and 5 crew members. * In 1996, two powerful bombs placed by the Basque group Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA) in the airport left more than 30 people injured. That same day two other bombs exploded in two hotels located near the airport. * In 2004 a Swearingen Metro aircraft was to be repositioned to Barcelona Airport for maintenance work, but during takeoff, while accelerating 80 knots, the nose gear collapsed. The aircraft sustained serious damage to the fuselage, engines and the propellers.

It is the first Filipino American film to be released theatrically nationwide, starting in March 2001 in the San Francisco Bay area and ending in November 2002 in New York City. It is also one of the first feature films to take place within the Filipino American community, one of the largest Asian ethnic minorities in America. Synopsis Dante Basco (Biker Boyz, Hook) plays Ben Mercado, a talented high school senior who enrolls in a prestigious arts institute in order to realize his dreams of becoming an artist. However, his plans come into conflict with those of his strict immigrant father Roland (Tirso Cruz III), a postal worker intent on seeing Ben become a doctor. Their long-simmering feud‚Äîfor Ben, a struggle to be accepted by America and therefore reject his Filipino heritage; and for Roland, a quest to give his children a better life than he had‚Äîthreatens to boil over and ruin the elaborate eighteenth birthday party of Ben‚Äôs sister Rose (Bernadette Balagtas). However, it is at the party where everything starts to change for Ben. The celebration emerges as a cultural stew of old world traditions and contemporary urban lifestyle, challenging Ben‚Äôs sense of misplaced identity, his choice of friends, even the way he regards his father. He also finds an unexpected confidante (and perhaps a love interest) in Rose‚Äôs best friend Annabelle (Joy Bisco). However, the evening‚Äôs challenges to Ben are just beginning to surface. The arrival of the Mercado family‚Äôs overbearing patriarch (Eddie Garcia) exacerbates tensions between father and son, while the temptation to ditch the relatives to be with his friends at a kegger across town tugs at Ben throughout the evening. Worse, his budding romance with Annabelle is complicated by the presence of hot-headed Augusto (Darion Basco), a former boyhood friend-turned gangsta wannabe‚Äîand Annabelle‚Äôs ex. In one night, Ben will face the true nature of his relationships with his family, his friends, and himself. The history/making of the film The Debut is based on a ten-minute short film Cajayon had made as his thesis project at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California, United States. He incorporated themes from co-writer John Manal Castro's short film, Diary of a Gangsta Sucka. The full-length film took eight years to produce and raise funding for (from 1992 to 2000), and another year to be released in theaters, and two years to go on DVD in 2003 and television. In 2012, it was made available on iTunes, Amazon Video, and VUDU.Amazon.com, The Debut, https://www.amazon.com/The-Debut-Dante-Basco/dp/B0000AGQ6W After shooting the first ten minutes of his thesis project, Cajayon sent the movie script to potential private financial backers but was turned down. Cajayon and Castro shopped the film to every major Hollywood studio (Disney, Warner Bros., MGM, Paramount, 20th Century Fox, Columbia, Universal), but was rebuffed. Eventually, producer Dean Devlin became associated with the project, and the film was able to garner a grant from NAATA (National Asian American Telecommunications Association). The filmmakers were able to set up the film independently. Cajayon tapped Picture Bride producer Lisa Onedera, husband Greg Spence, and Celestial Pictures to produce the film. Adult roles in the movie were cast in the Philippines, where casting director Ernest Eschaler held casting sessions in Manila. The filmmakers were able to cast Tirso Cruz III, Gina Alajar, Eddie Garcia, and comedian Fe De Los Reyes. Back in the US, the filmmakers put out a casting call for the lead character, eventually selecting Dante Basco, who played Rufio in Steven Spielberg's movie, Hook. Actress Joy Bisco was cast as the female lead. Production started on October 21, 1997 at the Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary High School in Montebello, California. Reshoots were done a year after production finished. The musical score and licensing of songs for the soundtrack was done in 1999. The film had its world premiere as the Opening Night Attraction of the 15th Annual Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film & Video Festival on May 18, 2000.Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, A Brief History, http://asianfilmfestla.org/2012/fest- info/a-brief-history/ Early success Prior to the film's theatrical release in 2001, the film was shown at various film festivals around the United States, including the Hawaii International Film Festival in November 2000. American film critic Roger Ebert, in attendance, was given a private screening of the film and gave the film a \\"thumbs up.\\" The Debut won the 2000 HIFF Audience Award for Best Feature Film, beating out heavily favored Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film was also awarded Best Feature Film honors by the 2000 San Diego Asian Film Festival. Theatrical release The Debut‚Äôs success on the film festival circuit inspired the filmmakers to launch a theatrical self-distribution campaign. For two years, The Debut‚Äôs promotional team (consisting of Cajayon, co-writer John Castro, associate producer Patricio Ginelsa, and a full-time staff of five) traveled to fifteen major cities across the United States and promoted the film directly to Asian Pacific American and mainstream communities. TV commercials were shown on local channels and on local cable systems. The Debut eventually grossed $1.8 million at the box office and won the 2001 Emmy Award for Best Independent Feature Film. The movie's success in theaters led to a domestic and international distribution deal with Sony Pictures. The film has now been released in theaters, DVD, home video, television in over fifty countries worldwide, iTunes, Amazon Video, and VUDU. Reception The film has been given positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes post a 74% \\"fresh\\" rating for the film.

The new RAAs were intermediate organisations acting as a link between the Arts Council and the regions set up by Local Authorities or consortiums of local arts associations. By 1971 there were twelve associations providing funding and advice for arts organisations.. From the early 1970s they became the responsibility of the Council's Regional Development Department. When that Department was disbanded in 1976, the RAAs came under the then Deputy Secretary General, Angus Stirling, until 1980 when a Regional Department was formed. The Wilding report of 1989 recommended the RAAs should be replaced as there was significant differences in distribution of funding between different regions. They were replaced by 10 Regional Arts Boards (RABs) in 1990.. The new Boards received the majority of their funding directly from the Arts Council rather than local sources. This changed the nature and structure of regional arts. These were independent non-profit limited by guarantee companies with some local authority representation on their management boards, but the democratic role and the link between subscription and governance was broken. Payment of a subscription did not guarantee a seat or a vote. After the Arts Council of Great Britain was abolished in 1994, the RABs were transferred to a new single body: Arts Council England. In 2001 it was announced that the RABS would be abolished in an effort to streamline the administration of Arts Council England.. The Boards closed in April 2002 and smaller regional offices were maintained in the regions, except the South East Board which became part of southern region, to bring them into line with the then regional development agency areas.

Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static and thus largely determines the strategic nature of the position. General observations Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and , once created, are usually permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid them (but there are exceptions‚Äîfor instance see Boleslavsky hole below). In the absence of these structural weaknesses, it is not possible to assess a pawn formation as good or bad‚Äîmuch depends on the position of the pieces. The pawn formation does determine the overall strategies of the players to a large extent, however, even if arising from unrelated openings. Pawn formations symmetrical about a vertical line (such as the e5 Chain and the d5 Chain) may appear similar, but they tend to have entirely different characteristics because of the propensity of the kings to castle on the . Pawn structures often transpose into one another, such as the Isolani into the Hanging pawns, and vice versa. Such transpositions must be considered carefully and often mark shifts in game strategy. The major pawn formations In his 1995 book Pawn Structure Chess, Andrew Soltis classified the major pawn formations into 17 categories. In 2015, the book Chess Structures, by Mauricio Flores Rios, further studied the subject, subdividing pawn structures into the 28 most important. For a formation to fall into a particular category, it need not have a pawn position identical to the corresponding diagram, but only close enough that the character of the game and the major themes are unchanged. It is typically the whose position influences the nature of the game the most. Structures with mutually attacking pawns are said to have tension. They are ordinarily unstable and tend to transpose into a stable formation with a pawn or exchange. Play often revolves around making the transposition happen under favorable circumstances. For instance, in the Queen's Gambit Declined, Black waits until White the to make the d5xc4 capture, transposing to the Slav formation (see below). Caro formation Openings: Primary: Caro‚ÄìKann. Other: French, Scandinavian, Trompowsky (colors reversed), Alekhine's. Character: Slow-paced game. Themes for White: Outpost on e5, kingside advantage, d4‚Äìd5 break, possibility of in the endgame (typically after the exchange of White's d-pawn for Black's c-pawn). Themes for Black: Weakness of the d4-pawn, ...c6‚Äìc5 and ...e6‚Äìe5 breaks. The latter break is usually preferable, but harder for Black to achieve. Slav formation Openings: Primary: Slav. Other: Catalan, Queen's Gambit Accepted, Queen's Gambit Declined, Nimzo-Indian, Colle System (with colors reversed), London System (with colors reversed), Trompowsky (colors reversed). Character: Slow-paced game. Themes for White: Pressure on the c-file, weakness of Black's c-pawn (either after Black's ...b7‚Äìb5 or after d4‚Äìd5xc6 in response to ...e6‚Äìe5), the d4‚Äìd5 break. Themes for Black: e6‚Äìe5 and c6‚Äìc5 breaks. Sicilian ‚Äì Scheveningen Openings: Primary: Sicilian (Najdorf, Richter‚ÄìRauzer and Sozin variations), Sicilian Scheveningen, and several other Sicilian variations. Other: King's English (colors reversed). Character: Complex, dynamic, sharp middlegame. Themes for White: Pressure on the d-file, space advantage, e4‚Äìe5 break (often prepared with f2‚Äìf4), f2‚Äìf4‚Äìf5 push, g2‚Äìg4‚Äìg5 blitz (see Keres Attack). Themes for Black: Pressure on the c-file, (and counterplay in general) on the queenside, pressure on White's pawn on e4 or e5, d6‚Äìd5 break, e6‚Äìe5 transposing into the Boleslavsky hole (see below). It is often unwise for White to exchange a piece on c6 allowing the recapture bxc6, because the phalanx of Black's center pawns becomes very strong. Sicilian ‚Äì Dragon Openings: Primary: Sicilian Dragon. Other: King's English (with colors reversed). Character: Either a razor sharp middlegame with opposite side castling or a moderately sharp game with same side castling. The Sicilian Dragon requires a high level of opening memorization to play properly. This is especially true when it comes to the Yugoslav Attack in which White plays the moves Be3, f3, Qd2 and 0-0-0. Other variations are: The Classical Dragon where White plays Be2 and 0-0; The Tal attack is defined by Bc4 and 0-0, and the Fianchetto Defense where White plays g3, Bg2 and 0-0. These less common variations lead to less tactical positions, with a potentially technical endgame. Themes for White: Outpost on d5, kingside attack (either f2‚Äìf4‚Äìf5 with kingside castling or h2‚Äìh4‚Äìh5 with queenside castling), weakness of Black's queenside pawn in the endgame. Themes for Black: Pressure on the long diagonal, queenside counterplay, exploiting White's often overextended kingside pawns in the endgame. Opening Lines: The most common variation of the Sicilian Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack. 1. e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 (the defining move of the Yugoslav attack) 6... Bg7 7. Qd2 0-0 8. f3 (necessary to prevent Black from playing 8...Ng4 to attack White's dark-squared bishop; 8.f3 also gives e4 extra defense and prepares to launch a pawn storm with the move g4) 8... Nc6 9. 0-0-0 (9.Bc4 is also a very common move in this position) 9... d5 (the main line; other ideas include 9...Nxd4 and 9...Bd7). Sicilian ‚Äì Boleslavsky hole Openings: Primary: Sicilian Najdorf, Classical, Sveshnikov, Kalashnikov. Other: Sicilian Prins, Moscow, O'Kelly (2... a6), King's English (with colors reversed). Character: Open, dynamic game. Themes for White: taking control the d5 , exploiting the backward d6-pawn, f2‚Äìf4 break. Themes for Black: d6‚Äìd5 break, queenside minority attack, the c4-square. It is a paradoxical idea that Black can strive for equality by voluntarily creating a hole on d5. The entire game revolves around control of the d5-square. Black must play very carefully or White will place a knight on d5 and obtain a commanding positional advantage. Black almost always equalizes, and might even obtain a slight edge, if the d6‚Äìd5 break can be made. Black has two options for his : on e6 and on b7 (after ...a7‚Äìa6 and ...b7‚Äìb5). Unusually for an open formation, bishops become inferior to knights because of the overarching importance of d5: White will often exchange Bg5xf6, and Black usually prefers to give up his queen's bishop rather than a knight in exchange for a white knight if it gets to d5. When White castles queenside, Black often delays castling because his king is quite safe in the . Mar√≥czy Bind {align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -valign=\\"top\\" } Openings: Primary: Sicilian, King's Indian Defence. Other: Symmetrical English, King's English (with colors reversed), Queen's Indian Defence, Nimzo-Indian Defence. Character: Semi-open game. Themes for White: Nd4‚Äìc2‚Äìe3, fianchettoing one or both bishops, the Mar√≥czy hop (Nc3‚Äìd5 followed by e4xd5 with terrific pressure on the e-file), kingside attack, c4‚Äìc5 and e4‚Äìe5 breaks. Themes for Black: b7‚Äìb5 break, f7‚Äìf5 break (especially with a fianchettoed king's bishop), d6‚Äìd5 break (prepared with ...e7‚Äìe6). The Mar√≥czy bind, named after G√©za Mar√≥czy, has a fearsome reputation. Chess masters once believed that allowing the bind was a mistake as Black always gave White a significant advantage. Indeed, if Black does not quickly make a , his will , with minor pieces lacking any squares to move to and possibly becoming cornered or pressed into a weak defense. Conversely, the formation takes time to set up and limits the activity of White's light- squared bishop, which can buy Black some breathing room to accomplish this break. Hedgehog Openings: Primary: Symmetrical English, Sicilian. Other: King's English (with colors reversed), King's Indian Defence (S√§misch), Queen's Indian Defense, Nimzo-Indian Defence. Character: Closed, Semi-open game. The Hedgehog is a formation similar to the Mar√≥czy bind, and shares the strategic ideas with that formation. Typically, the Mar√≥czy bind would transpose into the Hedgehog formation. Rauzer formation Openings: Primary: King's Indian, Old Indian (colors reversed), Ruy Lopez, Italian Game. Other: Ruy Lopez (colors reversed), Italian Game (colors reversed), Sicilian Kramnik. The notation in the rest of this section refers to the colors reversed version. Character: Semi-open game. Themes for White: d6 weakness, c4‚Äìc5 push, a3‚Äìf8 diagonal, queenside pawn storm. Themes for Black: d4 weakness, a1‚Äìh8 diagonal, f4-square, kingside attack, trading pieces for a superior endgame. The Rauzer formation is named after Rauzer who introduced it in the Ruy Lopez. It can also rarely occur in the Ruy Lopez with colors reversed. It is considered to give Black excellent chances because d6 is much less of a hole than White's d4. If the black king's bishop is fianchettoed it is common to see it undeveloped to f8 to control the vital c5- and d6-squares, or remove White's dark-squared bishop, the guardian of the hole. The Rauzer formation is often misjudged by beginners. In the position on the left, White appears to have a development lead while Black's position appears to be riddled with holes. In reality, it is Black who stands clearly better, because White has no real way to improve his position while Black can improve by exploiting the d4-square (see complete game on Java (Applet) board). Boleslavsky Wall Openings: Primary: King's Indian. Other: English, Pirc, Ruy Lopez, Philidor, Italian Game. Character: Semi-open game, slow buildup. Occurs after exchange of pawns on d4. Name given by Hans Kmoch. Themes for White: exploitation of d6 weakness, e4‚Äìe5 and c4‚Äìc5 breaks, minority attack with ...b2‚Äìb4‚Äìb5. Themes for Black: attacking the e4- and c4-pawns, d6‚Äìd5 and f7‚Äìf5 breaks, queenside play with ...a7‚Äìa5‚Äìa4. The wall is yet another structure that leaves Black with a d-pawn weakness, but prevents White from taking control of the center and gives Black active piece play and an opportunity to play on either side of the board. d5 chain Openings: Primary: King's Indian, Pirc, Philidor. Other: Benoni, Ruy Lopez (Spanish), Trompowsky, English, Italian Game. Character: Closed game with opposite side activity. Themes for White: Massive queenside space advantage, c2‚Äìc4‚Äìc5 break (optionally prepared with b2‚Äìb4), prophylaxis with ...g2‚Äìg4 (after f2‚Äìf3), f2‚Äìf4 break. Themes for Black: kingside attack, f7‚Äìf5 break, g7‚Äìg5‚Äìg4 break (after f2‚Äìf3), c7‚Äìc6 break, prophylaxis with ...c6‚Äìc5 or ...c7‚Äìc5 transposing to a full Benoni formation. The chain arises from a variety of openings but most commonly in the heavily analyzed King's Indian Classical variation. The theme is a race for a breakthrough on opposite flanks ‚Äì Black must try to whip up a kingside attack before White's penetrate with devastating effect on the c-file. The position was thought to strongly favor White until a seminal game (Taimanov‚ÄìNajdorf 1953) where Black introduced the maneuver ...Rf8‚Äìf7, ...Bg7‚Äìf8, ...Rf7‚Äìg7. When the chain arises in the Ruy Lopez, play is much slower with tempo being of little value and featuring piece maneuvering by both sides, Black focusing on the c7‚Äìc6 break and White often trying to play on the kingside with the f2‚Äìf4 break. e5 chain Openings: Primary: French. Other: Nimzowitsch, Trompowsky, Caro‚ÄìKann, Bogo-Indian, London System, Colle System, Sicilian (Rossolimo, Alapan, Closed, O'Kelly), Nimzo‚ÄìLarsen Attack (colors reversed). Character: Closed/semi-open but sharp game. Themes for White: kingside mating attack, f2‚Äìf4‚Äìf5 break. Themes for Black: Exchanging the hemmed-in queen's bishop, c7‚Äìc5 and f7‚Äìf6 breaks. Due to White's kingside space advantage and development advantage, Black must generate counterplay or be mated. Novices often lose to the sparkling Greek gift sacrifice. Attacking the head of the pawn chain with ...f7‚Äìf6 is seen as frequently as attacking its base, because it is harder for White to defend the head of the chain than in the d5 chain. In response to exf6, Black accepts a backward e6-pawn in exchange for freeing his position (the b8‚Äìh2 diagonal and the semi-open f-file) and the possibility of a further e6‚Äìe5 break. If White exchanges with d4xc5 it is called the Wedge formation. White gets an outpost on d4 and the possibility of exploiting the dark squares while Black gets an overextended e5 pawn to work on. Modern Benoni formation Openings: Primary: Modern Benoni, Queen's Indian Defence, King's Indian Defence Modern Defence, Ruy Lopez, Italian Game. Other: Trompowsky, Ruy Lopez (colors reversed), Italian Game (colors reversed), R√©ti Opening (colors reversed), King's Indian Attack (colors reversed), Sicilian Defence (Moscow, Rossolimo). Character: Semi-open game. Themes for White: Central pawn majority, e4‚Äìe5 break. Themes for Black: Queenside pawn majority. Giuoco Piano ‚Äì Isolani formation Openings: Primary: Giuoco Piano. Other: French (Steiner, Exchange), Ruy Lopez (Berlin), Petrov, King's English, French (colors reversed), Sicilian Alapan (colors reversed). Character: Open game. Themes for White: Themes for Black: Blockading the isolani, trading pieces for a favorable endgame. Queen's Gambit ‚Äì Isolani formation Openings: Primary: Queen's Gambit. Other: French, Sicilian Alapan, Symmetrical English, Caro‚ÄìKann, Nimzo-Indian, Slav. Character: . Themes for White: d4‚Äìd5 break, sacrifice of the isolani, outpost on e5, kingside attack. Themes for Black: Blockading the isolani, trading pieces for a favorable endgame. The isolani leads to lively play revolving around the d5-square. If Black can clamp down on the pawn, her positional strengths and threat of exchanges give her the advantage. If not, the threat of the d4‚Äìd5 break is ever-present, and the isolani can sometimes be sacrificed to unleash the potential of White's pieces, enabling White to whip up a whirlwind attack. Garry Kasparov is famous for the speculative d4‚Äìd5 sacrifice. Hanging pawns Openings: Primary: Queen's Gambit Declined. Other: Queen's Indian Defense, Symmetrical English, Sicilian (Alapan). Character: Open game. Themes for White: Line opening advance in the center, kingside attack. Themes for Black: Forcing a pawn advance and blockading the pair, conversion to isolani. Like the isolani, the are a structural weakness and must not be entered into unless the piece position offers some compensation. The play revolves around Black trying to force one of the pawns to advance. If Black can establish a permanent blockade the game is positionally won. On the other hand, White aims to keep the pawns hanging, trying to generate a kingside attack leveraging off of their superior center control. Other themes for White include tactical possibilities and line opening breaks in the center. Carlsbad formation Openings: Primary: Queen's Gambit Declined. Other: Caro‚ÄìKann (colors reversed), Colle System (colors reversed), London System (colors reversed). Character: Semi-open game. Themes for White: Minority attack, e3‚Äìe4 break. Themes for Black: e4 outpost, kingside attack. Panov formation Openings: Primary: Queen's Gambit Declined, Caro‚ÄìKann. Other: Alekhine Defense, QGD Tarrasch Defense (colors reversed), Symmetrical English, Symmetrical English (colors reversed). Character: Semi-open, dynamic game. Themes for White: Exploiting the dark squares, d6 outpost; queenside majority in the endgame, with an advanced pawn. Themes for Black: e4 outpost, kingside attack, White's overextended pawn, e6‚Äìe5 and b7‚Äìb5 breaks. Stonewall formation Openings: Primary: Dutch Defense. Other: Colle System, Bird's Opening (with colors reversed). Character: Closed game, uncomplicated strategy. Themes: Exchanging the bad bishop, e4/e5 outposts, breaks on the c and g files. Players must carefully consider how to recapture on the e4/e5-square, since it alters the symmetric pawn formation and creates strategic subtleties. Botvinnik system Openings: Primary: English, King's Indian Attack. Other: Sicilian (Closed, Moscow), Vienna Game, Bishop's Opening. Character: Closed game, uncomplicated strategy. Themes: Exchanging the bad bishop, d4/d5 outposts, breaks on the b- and f-files. This structure appears in one of Botvinnik's treatments of the English. Players must carefully consider how to recapture on the d4/d5-square, since it alters the symmetric pawn formation and creates strategic subtleties. Adding the typical White fianchetto of the king's bishop to this structure provides significant pressure along the long diagonal, and usually prepares the f2‚Äìf4‚Äìf5 break. Closed Sicilian formation Openings: Primary: Closed Sicilian, Closed English (colors reversed). Character: Closed, complicated position. Themes for White: kingside pawn storm, c2‚Äìc3 and d3‚Äìd4 break. Themes for Black: queenside pawn storm, a1‚Äìh8 diagonal.

These cars were built specifically for use on the IRT Corona Line (currently known as the IRT Flushing Line, used by the 7 train), and the IRT Astoria Line (currently known as the BMT Astoria Line, used by the N and W trains). They had special gear ratios to climb the steep grades (4.5%) in the Steinway Tunnels, something standard IRT equipment could not do. History The Steinways were among the first Low-Voltage cars delivered to the IRT, starting with the 12 car order from Pressed Steel Car Company in 1915. Pullman then built and delivered at least 70 Steinway cars in 1916. In 1925, American Car and Foundry delivered 25 Steinway cars, which would be the last standard body IRT cars built. The last Steinways placed in service were 30 cars converted from former Flivver and Lo-V trailers. These cars were built as part of the 1915 and 1916 orders from Pullman. The Steinways served the Flushing and Astoria lines until 1950, when they were displaced by the R12, R14, and R15 cars. The Steinways were then transferred to the IRT Broadway‚Äì7th Ave‚ÄìVan Cortlandt Park Line, where they were used with the Hi-Vs and few Lo-Vs until 1952, when they were transferred to the IRT Lexington Ave‚ÄìPelham Bay Local Line, joining the World's Fair Steinway cars, as well as other Hi-Vs remained in this service. In 1956, they were displaced by the arriving R17 cars, to other East Side and West Side lines, and remained until 1963, when most of these cars were retired. A small number remained on the fragment of the 3rd Ave El in the Bronx to finish out their years, until November 3, 1969. No examples of this car survive. Similar cars The 1938 World's Fair Lo-V was technically a \\"Steinway\\" car, as it also contained the special gear ratios required to climb the grades of the Steinway Tunnels. However, as the World's Fair Lo-V is significantly different, it is a separate and distinct car class and not included in the \\"Steinway\\" grouping.

A total of 1,020 cars were built, which consisted of 725 motors and 295 trailers. It was the third \\"Lo-V\\" type car ordered for the IRT (after the Flivver Lo-Vs and the first Steinway Lo-Vs). Description Lo-Vs were arranged in mixed trains consisting of trailer cars and motor cars. While trailer cars were equipped with brakes, but no air compressors or motors, motor cars were equipped with all three. \\"Lo-V\\" is short for \\"Low Voltage\\", which refers to the cars' form of propulsion control. Earlier Composite and \\"Hi-V\\" (High Voltage) equipment that ran on the IRT had utilized a 600 volt DC circuit that ran directly through the motorman's master controller to control the car's propulsion. The 600 volts was also trainlined through the whole train by the use of high voltage jumper cables, which had to be run between cars. However, Lo-V equipment used battery voltage (32 volts) in the motor control circuit to move high voltage (600 volts) contacts underneath the car, which would control the car's propulsion. Likewise, it would no longer be necessary to use 600 volt jumpers between the cars. This tremendously improved the safety of the equipment for both train crews and shop personnel alike. Standard Lo-V cars also simplified braking for train crews. On IRT equipment, an electric brake could be utilized to synchronize a braking effort and apply each car's brakes simultaneously and uniformly throughout the train. This was different from operating strictly using air (pneumatically), which was less responsive, but would still stop the train albeit more slowly. Lo-V cars simplified the braking process. On earlier IRT equipment, the braking notches were different for a motorman, depending on whether or not he was operating electrically or pneumatically. On Lo-V cars, the notches were identical, regardless of whether or not the electric brake was active. The braking system on a Lo-V car is known as AMUE. History The Lo-Vs served much of their time on the Lexington Avenue express services and the Seventh Avenue‚ÄìEast 180th Street‚ÄìBronx Park express services, but appeared on virtually all other IRT lines during their careers. In 1960, a few cars were modified for operation on some BMT shuttle services, by adding extensions on their sides at floor level to fill in the wider platform gaps on the BMT; this lasted only for a year.https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Chapter_3,_The_BMT#Section_D:_Strangers_On_The_BMThttps://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?24418 After 48 years of service, most of the Lo-V cars were retired in 1963, spending their last days on the Lexington‚ÄìJerome line. Some cars, however, remained in service on the 7th Avenue‚ÄìLenox express until the spring of 1964. A handful number of trailer cars remained on the fragment of IRT Third Avenue Line in the Bronx to finish out their years, until November 3, 1969. Some Lo- Vs were converted into work cars following their retirement from revenue service. They were eventually replaced by retired SMEE cars converted into work cars and were eventually all scrapped.https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Chapter_2,_The_IRT_Subway#Section_F:_Low_Voltage_Cars.2C_A_Milestone Preservation *Car 4902 (trailer car) has been preserved by the New York Transit Museum and restored. *Car 5290 (motor car) has been preserved by Railway Preservation Corp. and restored. *Car 5292 (motor car) has been preserved by Railway Preservation Corp. and restored. *Car 5443 (motor car) has been preserved by Railway Preservation Corp. and restored. *Car 5466 (motor car) has been preserved by the Shore Line Trolley Museum in East Haven, Connecticut, and restored.

They were built in prototype form in 1934 with production models built in 1936. Built by the Budd, Pullman, and St. Louis car companies, they were called \\"Multis\\" for short. They were so named because each car was an articulated car made of five sections; though the MS Multi-section fleet's lengths differed, their average length was . The MS Multi-section fleet consisted of 27 cars. The two prototype cars were the Zephyr, manufactured by the Budd Company, and the Green Hornet, manufactured by the Pullman Company; these were scrapped during World War II. The 25 production cars were made by the Pullman and St. Louis companies, and remained in service until 1961. None of the MS Multi-section cars survive today. Background The MS was an articulated car made up of five sections. Their average length was , making them the longest articulated units ever used in the history of the BMT. The first two cars delivered were pilot cars. One was manufactured by the Budd Company, and the other by Pullman Company. The Pullman version was known as the Green Hornet, while Budd's was called the Zephyr, both names being unofficial. The Green Hornet and the 25 production cars had two double-leaf doors on each section (10 doors per unit), while the Zephyr had four single-leaf doors on each section (20 doors per unit). These cars were in production at the same time as the Union Pacific M-10000 and the Budd Pioneer Zephyr for the CB&Q.; Testing of these cars proved successful, and the BMT ordered a further 25 cars, 15 from Pullman and 10 from St. Louis Car Co. History=Prototypes The BMT Green Hornet at the Pullman-Standard plant in Chicago, IL The BMT Zephyr in Coney Island Yard The Zephyr and the Green Hornet, originally numbered 7002/7003 and 7000/7001, respectively, were delivered in 1934. The two units were initially tested on the Fulton Street elevated for comparison, and when the tests were concluded they were relegated to Franklin Ave Shuttle service, almost never appearing in through service to Brighton Beach or Coney Island except occasionally for put- ins (out-of-service trains re-inserted in revenue service) or layups (out-of- service trains stored on unused yard or express tracks). In 1937, the Green Hornet was renumbered to 7003, and the Zephyr was renumbered to 7029. The Green Hornet had undergone some slight modifications, and the BMT management hoped to eventually run it in consists with the Pullman-Standard built Multi- units. However, with the onset of World War II, the Green Hornet was scrapped in 1942 for its valuable aluminum body. The unit had been plagued by master controller problems and was only in service for three years before it was withdrawn after maintenance revealed two cracked trucks. The Zephyr had a much better service record and remained in service on the Franklin Avenue Shuttle until it was retired in 1954. The unit was then scrapped in 1959. Production cars The 25 production cars were built by Pullman Standard and the St. Louis Car Company. Units 7003 and 7014‚Äì7028 A-B-C-B1-A1 were built by Pullman, while units 7004‚Äì7013 A-B-C-B1-A1 were built by St. Louis Car Company. They were introduced in 1936, but were quickly withdrawn from service for truck modifications. The St. Louis built units over the years were particularly troublesome in that regard. Despite all issues, the production cars were returned to service one year later and began serving on the Canarsie Line. In December 1956, the cars were transferred to Myrtle‚ÄìChambers service for purposes of cutting their mileage, as was commonly done at the time with all oddball types of equipment. One train, in addition, ran in the Broadway \\"short line\\" service. In February 1958, a few units underwent a one-week stint in Franklin Avenue service (shuttle and on the last day, a Sunday, local to Brighton Beach). They were finally retired from service on September 5, 1961, by the R27s and R30s. All were scrapped later that year. Additional information The MS was notable for its rapid acceleration rate ( for the Green Hornet and the 25 production cars, and for the Zephyr) and its \\"balancing speed\\" ‚Äî the maximum speed attainable on level track, running empty ‚Äî was relatively high ( for the Green Hornet, for the Zephyr, and for the 25 production units). The Zephyr was built without couplers, so it could only operate as a single unit. The Green Hornet subway car was among the first subway cars to incorporate a warning tone that sounds before the doors begin to close as the train prepares to leave the station. This feature, however, would not become standard for all subway cars until the R44 order in 1971. ReferencesFurther reading * Sansone, Gene.

The Berkut 360 is featured in the 2010 movie Kill Speed (Fast Glass).https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1027683/http://www.impdb.org/index.php?title=Kill_Speed Development The prototype Berkut was designed and built by Dave H. Ronneberg as part of a business partnership between Ronneberg and Donald S. Murphy, called Experimental Aviation, that lasted from 1989 to 1992.Court transcript In 1992 the partnership dissolved and Ronneberg, incorporating as Experimental Aviation, Inc., brought the aircraft to market as a kit, while Murphy wanted to shelve the project entirely. A subsequent series of lawsuits between the two resulted in bankruptcy for Ronneberg and Murphy as individuals and for Experimental Aviation as a corporation. The kit was resurrected in 1996 by Renaissance Composites, with Ronneberg working as a consultant. In January 2001, under pressure from Ronneberg, Renaissance sold the assets to Vicki Cruse, an American aerobatic pilot,EAA Chapter 96 newsletter, the Peninsula Flyer who then formed Berkut Engineering and Design, Inc. That company withdrew the aircraft from the market in 2002. Ronneberg continued with the project, which is now directed at UAV markets.UAV flight demonstration video A deal was struck in 2003 to sell the project to Republic Aerospace, but the deal fell through. Cruse was no longer involved with day- to-day operations, but maintained ownership until her death on August 22, 2009, when the aircraft she was flying ‚Äî a borrowed Zivko Edge 540 ‚Äî crashed in Buckinghamshire, England, during a qualifying flight for the World Aerobatic Championships. Through the various incarnations, approximately 75 kits were sold and 20 airplanes completed. Configuration The Berkut is derived from the Rutan Long-EZ, with the primary differences being retractable main landing gear, dual canopies, and molded fuselage, strakes, and wing spar. Like the Long EZ, the Berkut carries two people in a tandem seating arrangement. The front seat occupant has access to all instrumentation and controls. The rear seat, normally holding the passenger, is equipped with a side stick and throttle, but no rudder pedals, brakes, or instruments. Aerodynamic optimizations to the original Long-EZ airframe were made to increase performance and interior space. The fuselage was stretched and the nose, canard, instrument panel and pilot moved forward one foot (300 mm), to allow a heavier engine to be used in the rear. The main wing trailing edge was straightened, removing a small bend in the trailing edge of the Long EZ wing. The lower winglet was removed and the aileron size increased in both chord and span, significantly increasing roll rate. Early Berkuts used wings and canard that were structurally similar to the Long-EZ and used solid blue 2 lb/cu. ft. density Dow STYROFOAM PI cores cut to shape with a hot-wire foam cutter, but with carbon fiber reinforced polymer skins instead of fiberglass. The fuselage and winglets remained fiberglass. Later versions (kits produced after spring 1999) used fully molded carbon fiber canards and wings with high density, 5 lb/cu. ft. 1/4\\" thick PVC or SAN foam cores, leaving only minor fairings and tip surfaces to be carved from foam. The Berkut has always used the Roncz 1145MS canard airfoil, which is more tolerant of insect and rain contamination than the GU 25-5(11)8 airfoil originally used on the Long-EZ. The Berkut used a retractable main (rear) landing gear system designed by Shirl Dickey for his E-Racer homebuilt. Originally, Berkut used gear parts produced by Dickey, but over time they were repeatedly re-engineered and strengthened. Later kits had gear components produced entirely in-house. Like the earlier Vari-Eze and Long EZ, the Berkut kneels with its nose gear retracted to prevent the aircraft from tipping over backwards when parked without a pilot in the front seat. Some early Berkuts utilized hydraulic nose-gear extension systems, but most have used an electro-mechanical jack-screw. With the electric system, the pilot and passenger can climb into the cockpit, then extend the nose gear, raising the airplane with occupants inside. While the Long-EZ, originally designed for the Lycoming O-235 108-118 hp engine, was closer in the design of the Berkut, the latter was designed from the outset for the larger Lycoming IO-360 180 hp engine. The aircraft was later adapted, with a different engine mount, cowls and battery location, to accept the 260 hp Lycoming IO-540, which most builders chose. With the O-540, some have reportedly reached speeds of 300 mph in level flight. Selected accidents Irrespective of cause, the Berkut has a poor overall safety record, with at least 6 of the 31 aircraft built having been involved in serious to catastrophic accidents or incidents. The manufacturer or somebody associated closely with the manufacturer has explained this as follows: \\"There were some accidents the first years caused by errors in the assembly, so it was decided to start selling it finished (or with assistance during the final construction). There were also some accidents that were caused by pilot errors. But there has never been an accident caused by failures in the airplane or the design.\\" Here are 5 \\"selected\\" accidents/incidents: ;N91DR :The original prototype, crashed by Rick Fessenden at an airshow at Santa Paula, California on 12 August 1995. Although the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation concluded that an accelerated stall during Fessenden's \\"wind-up turn\\" ‚Äî a level, 360-degree, very high-g turn ‚Äî caused the airplane to crash, examination of videotapes of the crash gave a strong indication that the pilot blacked out under 9g+. Fessenden was killed.NTSB report ;N260DG :The first Berkut 540, built by Dan Gray, crashed at Santa Paula, California on 9 June 1996. Gray started and finished his first flight at nearby Camarillo airport, but on his second flight he chose to return to Santa Paula. On final approach his engine stopped and, in attempting to set down on a nearby freeway, he collided head-on with a Honda station wagon. The aircraft was extensively damaged but Gray was only bruised. The cause was found to be an incorrectly rebuilt fuel pump.NTSB report ;N600SE :Built by Michael Kashan, this airplane served as the company demonstrator for several years. While being flown by another pilot on 1 July 2000, the aircraft encountered a dust devil on final approach at Jackpot, Nevada. This flipped the airplane upside down and it tumbled down the runway. Both wings were broken, the right strake and spar were broken halfway between the fuselage and the end of the spar, the main gear was torn out, and the nose crushed back to the instrument panel. The pilot's legs were broken, but the passenger suffered only a minor cut to the scalp. The airplane was rebuilt and is flying again.NTSB report ;N538AJ :This airplane, owned by John Daniels, has had several accidents, all involving the landing gear. The NTSB report concerns its first, a gear collapse at Jackson Hole, Wyoming on 18 June 1996.NTSB report Later, the airplane overran the runway at First Flight airport, tearing out its gear legs. There have been no injuries from any of the accidents. ;N827CM :Built by Steve Drybread. During a test flight on 23 May 2002 near Anderson, Indiana, Drybread omitted the main canard attachment bolts. The canard separated in flight, and Drybread was killed.NTSB report ;N5439N :Built by Steve Drybread. While being flown by its owner, Charles Bracken, the CB540 aircraft struck high tension power wires near Lapeer, Michigan on 19 June 2004, and crashed into the ground. The airplane was destroyed, the nose crushed back to the pilot's seat. Bracken's legs were broken.NTSB report ;N3255U :Built by Jerrold S. Jorritsma. Experimental jet engine powered variant had its engine failed just after takeoff, the pilot was unable to circle back to the runway requiring an off runway landing.

Now retired, he worked as a partner at the firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. He was a design partner in the New York office from 1995 until 2018, and is a member of the American Institute of Architects and the League Circle of the Architectural League of New York. He received his Bachelor of Architecture from Carnegie Mellon University in 1979. Duffy currently lives with his wife and two children in Stuyvesant Town in New York City. Career After graduating from Carnegie Mellon, he attempted to find a job at many firms, eventually arriving in the lobby of SOM's Washington, DC office without an appointment. He was not promised an interview, simply waiting in the lobby for several days before David Childs interviewed him, on the basis of his determination. He worked in Washington for several years, before he moved to New York. Experimentation and collaboration are evident throughout Roger Duffy's projects worldwide, ranging from his award-winning Upper School and Library at Greenwich Academy, to the new home of the Skyscraper MuseumTower Power http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/ny- skyscrapermuseum-story,0,1580391.story> in New York, and the landside terminal at Ben Gurion International Airport. His design for the Kuwait Police Academy was included in the Venice Biennale, ‚ÄúNext‚Äù. He does not work in any particular style, instead choosing a design that is rooted in a deep understanding of the unique qualities of each client's program, site, and aspirations. His interest in making art integral to his designs has led to numerous fruitful collaborations with a wide range of artists, including James Turrell and Robert Whitman, and contributions from Lawrence Wiener. Duffy received AIA design awards for 350 Madison Avenue, Birch Meadows Tennis Academy, Delbarton School Performing Arts Center, Paterson PS 25, and multiple AIA design awards for Greenwich Academy and Burr Elementary School. He also won a PA award for 350 Madison Avenue. Duffy's buildings have been featured in the New York Times, A + U, International Design Magazine, Metropolis Magazine, House and Garden, and Architectural Record. Skyscraper Museum interior Sustainability is a key aspect of Duffy's design approach. His Koch Center for Science, Mathematics & Technology at Deerfield Academy will receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. To launch the programming and design of the building, Duffy organized a symposium, gathering experts from a variety of fields in a panel discussion. The symposium, a model adapted from the academic world, is characteristic of Duffy's interest in broadening the context in which architecture is conceived. In his work for schools, colleges, and universities, he looks for unique interventions to develop solutions to campus-wide problems and challenges. Duffy's master planning work at Marist College reflects a long-held interest in campus planning and urban design. Before he begins any project, Duffy studies and analyzes the functionality of the best of that building type. This benchmarking methodology yields to a conceptual process that involves transcending and superseding the current state-of-the-art. Two of Duffy's most important initiatives are the creation of the campus planning and design studio known as SOM Education Lab and the launching of the SOM Journal, an annually published book of the firm's best work as selected and critiqued by an independent jury of artists, designers, and critics. World Trade Center plans In December 2002, he headed a team that designed a proposal for the rebuilt World Trade Center in New York City. The group developed a complex, intertwined complex of nine bent buildings, interspersed vertically with small pocket parks. It was not well-received, worsened by the fact that Duffy barely spoke about his idea at the general presentation on the 15th of that month, suggesting that he did not have much to say about it. Duffy withdrew SOM from the competition in late January 2003, so that the firm could focus on its other project, 7 World Trade Center.

The novel depicts an alternate world where the American Revolution was unsuccessful. Although it is fiction, the novel takes the form of a work of nonfiction, specifically an undergraduate-level history of North America from 1763 to 1971. The fictional history includes a full scholarly apparatus, including a bibliography of 475 works and 860 footnotes citing imaginary books and articles; three appendices listing the leaders of the Confederation of North America, the United States of Mexico and Kramer Associates; an index; a contemporary map of the alternate North America; and a preface thanking imaginary people for their assistance with the book. The book also includes a critique of itself by Professor Frank Dana, an imaginary Mexican historian with two books listed in the bibliography. Background The United States of Mexico and the Confederation of North America in For Want of a Nail, 1775-1971. In the alternate world it describes, For Want of a Nail is a history of North America written by Robert Sobel, a business historian. North America is divided between two nations: the Confederation of North America (CNA), a union of British colonies that remains nominally associated with the United British Empire, and the United States of Mexico (USM), a bilingual nation resulting from an influx of expatriate American rebels to Colonial Mexico. Other major powers include the United British Empire itself; the German Empire, which dominates much of Europe and the Middle East; the Japanese Empire, which dominates eastern Asia; and Kramer Associates (KA), a vast global corporation that arose in the USM but is now based in Taiwan. All of the powers are engaged in a nuclear arms race that was initiated by Kramer Associates' detonation of an atomic bomb in 1962. Plot John Burgoyne, Duke of Albany: CNA Viceroy 1782-1783 in For Want of a Nail. For Want of a Nail opens in 1763, after the end of the Seven Years' War. Attempts by the British government to impose direct taxation on the American colonies provokes resistance by the colonists, which flares into open rebellion in 1775. After driving British troops from Boston and declaring independence, the American rebels suffer a series of reversals and lose control of New York City, Albany, and Philadelphia by the end of 1777. The point of divergence from actual history occurs in October 1777, when British General John Burgoyne defeats American Generals Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold at the Battle of Saratoga. Conciliationists gain control of the Continental Congress in 1778 and negotiate a truce that re-establishes British control. In 1780, seeking to prevent further rebellion, the British Parliament passes the Britannic Design, a bill that reorganizes the North American colonies into the partially self- governing Confederation of North America (CNA). However, many former rebels refuse to submit to British rule, and an exodus of pro-independence colonists to the Texas region of colonial Mexico takes place. The ex-Patriots in Texas organize themselves as the State of Jefferson, after the executed author of the Declaration of Independence. Though the French Revolution is averted, war erupts between Britain and France in 1795, and Spain is drawn into the conflict on the side of the French. Both Jefferson and the CNA use the situation as a pretext to invade Spanish territory, and the CNA absorbs both the Florida and Louisiana territories while the Jeffersonians expand to the northern banks of the Rio Grande. Mexico gains its independence in 1805 and immediately descends into chaos and civil war. The Jeffersonians eventually become involved, and a Jeffersonian army under Andrew Jackson captures Mexico City in 1817. By 1819, Jackson manages to engineer the merger of Jefferson and Mexico as the United States of Mexico (USM), and in 1821, he wins election as the new country's first president. In the CNA, industrialization takes root in the Northern Confederation, a union of the New England and mid-Atlantic colonies, and the invention of the cotton gin brings prosperity and widespread slavery to the Southern Confederation. The rapid industrial development, however, fosters resentment between rich industrialists and the working classes, and a financial crash in 1835 leads to a series of social upheavals, including the abolition of slavery in the Southern Confederation for economic reasons. The CNA eventually wins approval from London for a second \\"Britannic Design\\" to transform itself from a loose conglomeration of states to a unified nation with a governor-general, a central executive office of which General Winfield Scott is the first holder. After clashing with each other in the Rocky Mountain War (1845‚Äì1855), the CNA and USM go their separate ways. The CNA becomes increasingly isolationist, and though it is a prosperous industrialized nation, it suffers recurring bouts of internal civil strife. Meanwhile, its parliamentary democracy stabilizes into a two-party system: initially a pro-industrialist Liberal Party popular among the high and middle classes and a rural populist Conservative Party, but the latter is eventually displaced by a social democratic \\"People's Coalition.\\" As in real history, multicultural diversity occurs by the immigrant exodus from the ongoing turmoil in 19th-century Europe, and one confederation, South Vandalia, becomes majority African American after ex-slaves move there. The USM gives rise to a monopolistic corporation, Kramer Associates, and enters into a period of imperialistic expansion and dictatorship in the late 19th century that sees it conquer Central America, part of South America, Alaska, and Hawaii and ultimately create a puppet state in Siberia that destabilizes the Russian Empire into collapsing. A clash between the Mexican government and Kramer Associates in the 1920s and 1930s results in the latter relocating to the Philippines in 1936. In the outside world, the failed revolution had other consequences. Despite the failure of the French Revolution, an alternate version of the Napoleonic War still occurs in Europe because of the avaricious nature of Regent Marie Antoinette. Anglo-French enmities are not resolved until the mid-20th century. A Global War breaks out in 1939 pitting the British, French, and Japanese against the Germans and Mexicans, with the CNA remaining neutral. The war dies down, without officially ending, in 1948, with the Germans in control of Continental Europe and the Middle East, the Japanese in control of China, Siberia, and the western Pacific; Kramer Associates relocating to Taiwan; and the USM suffering a social breakdown and renewed dictatorship. The CNA, wrecked with collective guilt for avoiding the bloodshed and profiting from it, embarks on a quixotic foreign aid plan. Claiming peace as their goal, Kramer Associates detonates an atomic bomb in June 1962, which plunges the world into a nuclear arms race. The British detonate their own bomb in 1964, followed by the Germans in 1965 and the CNA in 1966. The bomb sharply polarizes the CNA, leading to internal strife between internationalists and peace factions. The leadership of the USM, unable to develop a bomb on their own accord, becomes aggressive and paranoid, increasing world tensions. The novel ends as global armament talks break down, and a USM spy ring is discovered in the CNA. The final section is a critique of the history by USM historian Frank Dana. Dana decries what he sees as the book's anti-Mexican bias, who complains that Sobel's central thesis was the simplistic notion that the North American Rebellion represented a conflict between moderation (CNA) and extremism (USM), which influences the remainder of the book against the USM. Dana also notes that the author himself is a beneficiary of Kramer Associates and so allows readers to possibly see Sobel as an unreliable narrator of the history. Writing and publication Sobel wrote the book in the summer of 1971 to keep himself occupied in between book contracts. Sobel's original title for the book was Scorpions in a Bottle, but his agent persuaded him to change it. The inspiration to write a counterfactual history came from Jeff Weinper, a former student of Sobel who later died in the Vietnam War and to whom the book is dedicated.Sobel, Robert (1973). For Want of a Nail: If Burgoyne Had Won at Saratoga. New York: Macmillan. Another aim of the book was to spoof the growing trend in academic history for heavily footnote-laden, unreadably dense prose (the more outrageous the assertion made in the text, the denser the footnotes). Each chapter was written in the style of a different academic historian, and the final critique by Frank Dana was based on the savage reviews commonplace in historical journals. Sobel took the names of historical characters and academic historians from friends and current and former students. A hardcover edition of For Want of a Nail was published in March 1973 by the Macmillan Company. The book was reviewed in several newspapers and in Time. For Want of a Nail was eventually republished in hardcover in 1997 by Greenhill Books of Great Britain, a publisher of military histories, after Greenhill's publisher heard about the book from the editor of the Military Book Club at a lunch in New York. Also in 1997, Sobel was awarded a Special Achievement Sidewise Award for Alternate History for the book. A softcover edition was published by Greenhill Books in 2002.

Literary significance and criticism When it first appeared in 1973, For Want of a Nail was unique: a book-length history of an alternate world that spelled out 200 years' worth of people, places, economics, finance, technology, politics, and war. The book initially gained little notice from Sobel's fellow historians. Alternate history was considered a subgenre of science fiction and so it was from fans of science fiction that the book gained its initial audience. It has since gained the status of a classic work of alternate history. See also *H.

Historically a High Sheriff was appointed to each of the Historic counties of England and Wales and those of Ireland. The Sheriffs Act 1887 sets out the appointments and qualifications of sheriffs in England and Wales. The shrievalties were subsequently redefined in terms of the new administrative counties established by the Local Government Act 1888 and Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. These were abolished in England and Wales in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, with shrievalties since then being defined in terms of the new local government areas created by that Act. As the structure of local government has changed since the introduction of unitary authorities from the 1990s onwards, the shrievalties in England and Wales are now defined as groups of local authorities, or parts of them, in a similar fashion to the Lieutenancies.

It is located on the Rhondda Line. History Two stations have served Porth. The first was opened on 4 February 1861 by the Taff Vale Railway; the line had been open since 10 June 1841. On 1 July 1876, the original station was closed, being replaced by a new one approximately to the east. The Rhondda Fawr line to Treherbert was singled north of here in 1981 and most of the 1876 station buildings were replaced in 1984‚Äì85. The now defunct Maerdy Branch along the Rhondda Fach valley to Maerdy and the collieries at Mardy and Ferndale used to diverge from the 'main line' to just north of the station at Maerdy Junction. Opened in stages between 1849 and 1856, the passenger service over this route ended in 1964, but mineral traffic to Mardy Colliery continued to run until final closure of the branch in August 1986, when coal from Mardy was then raised from Tower Colliery. The track was subsequently lifted in 1996, but the old formation can still be traced (along with the former up loop platform used by branch trains). A passenger service between Porth and was introduced by the Barry Railway on 16 March 1896, running via and ., but this ended in 1930 when the service was re-routed via the TVR station at Pontypridd (trains henceforth terminating there, except for summer excursions, until the service down to Barry finally ended in September 1962).

Today's sheriffs have only nominal duties, but the historical officeholders had important judicial responsibilities. They have attended the justices at the Central Criminal Court, Old Bailey, since its original role as the court for the City and Middlesex. The sheriffs live in the Central Criminal Court, Old Bailey, during their year of service, so that one of them can always be attendant on the judges. In Court No 1 the principal chairs on the bench are reserved for their and the Lord Mayor's use, with the Sword of the City hanging behind the bench. It is an invariable custom that the Lord Mayor of London must previously have served as a sheriff. By a \\"custom of immemorial usage in the City\\",Howell et al., p. 191 the two sheriffs are elected at the Midsummer Common Hall by the Liverymen by acclamation, unless a ballot is demanded from the floor, which takes place within fourteen days. The returning officers at the Common Hall are the Recorder of London (senior Judge of the \\"Old Bailey\\") and the outgoing Sheriffs. , the current sheriffs are Alderman Professor Michael Mainelli and Mr Christopher Hayward CC. As elected officers from the 7th century (excepting 1067 to 1132), the sheriffs' jurisdiction covers the square mile of the City of London. The more recent creation of High Sheriff of Greater London covers areas of London outside the City, which today incorporates parts of several old counties, most notably Middlesex. History of the office The title of sheriff, or shire reeve, evolved during the Anglo-Saxon period of English history. The reeve was the representative of the king in a city, town or shire, responsible for collecting taxes and enforcing the law.Bruce & Calder, p. 10. By the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066, the City of London had sheriffs, usually two at a time. The sheriffs were the most important city officials and collected London's annual taxes on behalf of the royal exchequer; they also had judicial duties in the City's law courts. Until , the sheriffs were directly appointed by the king. London gained a degree of self- government by a charter granted by Henry I, including the right to choose its own sheriff, a right which was affirmed in an 1141 charter by King Stephen. By Henry's charter, the sheriffs of London also gained jurisdiction over the neighbouring county of Middlesex, paying ¬£300 per annum to the Crown for the privilege. This did not make the county a dependency of the City but rather from that time the City of London and Middlesex were viewed as a single administrative area. In 1189, an annually elected mayor was introduced as chief magistrate for the City of London (along the lines of some European cities of the time such as Rouen and Liege); this change was reaffirmed by a charter granted by King John in 1215. As such, the sheriffs were relegated to a less senior role in the running of the city, and became subordinate to the mayor. The mayor (later Lord Mayor of the City of London) generally served as sheriff before becoming mayor, and in 1385 the Common Council of London stipulated that every future Lord Mayor should \\"have previously been Sheriff so that he may be tried as to his governance and bounty before he attains to the Estate of Mayoralty\\"; this tradition continues to this day. In 1889 the jurisdiction of the sheriffs was restricted to the City. The Local Government Act 1888 created a new office of High Sheriff of Middlesex appointed in the same manner as other English and Welsh counties. At the same time, the most populous parts of Middlesex were included in the new County of London, which had its own High Sheriff.

In 1975, Rowaishid established the Al Roba'y Al Kuwaiti]m group with three others, two of them being his friends and the remainder being his brother. However, the group disbanded in 1979, since then Alruwaishid has focused on his solo career. Alruwaished began his solo career in the early 1980s with the release of his first album with AlNazaer Music Production Company. Additionally, Alruwaishid rendered one of the songs from this album as a music video. Alruwaished released albums throughout the 1980s. During the early 1990s, Alruwaishid relocated temporarily to Egypt as Kuwait was invaded by Iraq. From there he continued his music career, including a short lived project with the famous Egyptian singer Mohammed Abdel Wahab. Unfortunately, Abdel Wahab died shortly after the start of the project. After the end of the Gulf War, Alruwaished returned to Kuwait and continued with his music career. In 1995, he signed a contract with the Saudi record company Rotana, since they offered him a better contract, than the Farasan Music Production Company had offered.

CDC is an approach to data integration that is based on the identification, capture and delivery of the changes made to enterprise data sources. CDC occurs often in data-warehouse environments since capturing and preserving the state of data across time is one of the core functions of a data warehouse, but CDC can be utilized in any database or data repository system.  Methodology  System developers can set up CDC mechanisms in a number of ways and in any one or a combination of system layers from application logic down to physical storage. In a simplified CDC context, one computer system has data believed to have changed from a previous point in time, and a second computer system needs to take action based on that changed data. The former is the source, the latter is the target. It is possible that the source and target are the same system physically, but that would not change the design pattern logically. Multiple CDC solutions can exist in a single system.  Timestamps on rows  Tables whose changes must be captured may have a column that represents the time of last change. Names such as LAST_UPDATE, etc. are common. Any row in any table that has a timestamp in that column that is more recent than the last time data was captured is considered to have changed.  Version numbers on rows  Database designers give tables whose changes must be captured a column that contains a version number. Names such as VERSION_NUMBER, etc. are common. When data in a row changes, its version number is updated to the current version. A supporting construct such as a reference table with the current version in it is needed. When a change capture occurs, all data with the latest version number is considered to have changed. When the change capture is complete, the reference table is updated with a new version number. Three or four major techniques exist for doing CDC with version numbers, the above paragraph is just one. = Use in optimistic locking = Version numbers can be useful with optimistic locking in ACID transactional or relational database management systems (RDBMS). For an example in read-then-update scenarios for CRUD applications in relational database management systems, a row is first read along with the state of its version number; in a separate transaction, a SQL UPDATE statement is executed along with an additional WHERE clause that includes the version number found from the initial read. If no record was updated, it usually means that the version numbers didn't match because some other action/transaction had already updated the row and consequently its version number. Several object relational mapping tools use this method to detect for optimistic locking scenarios (including Hibernate).  Status indicators on rows  This technique can either supplement or complement timestamps and versioning. It can configure an alternative if, for example, a status column is set up on a table row indicating that the row has changed (e.g., a boolean column that, when set to true, indicates that the row has changed). Otherwise, it can act as a complement to the previous methods, indicating that a row, despite having a new version number or a later date, still shouldn't be updated on the target (for example, the data may require human validation).  Time/Version/Status on rows  This approach combines the three previously discussed methods. As noted, it is not uncommon to see multiple CDC solutions at work in a single system, however, the combination of time, version, and status provides a particularly powerful mechanism and programmers should utilize them as a trio where possible. The three elements are not redundant or superfluous. Using them together allows for such logic as, \\"Capture all data for version 2.1 that changed between 6/1/2005 12:00 a.m. and 7/1/2005 12:00 a.m. where the status code indicates it is ready for production.\\"  Triggers on tables  May include a publish/subscribe pattern to communicate the changed data to multiple targets. In this approach, triggers log events that happen to the transactional table into another queue table that can later be \\"played back\\". For example, imagine an Accounts table, when transactions are taken against this table, triggers would fire that would then store a history of the event or even the deltas into a separate queue table. The queue table might have schema with the following fields: Id, TableName, RowId, TimeStamp, Operation. The data inserted for our Account sample might be: 1, Accounts, 76, 11/02/2008 12:15am, Update. More complicated designs might log the actual data that changed. This queue table could then be \\"played back\\" to replicate the data from the source system to a target. [More discussion needed] An example of this technique is the pattern known as the log trigger.  Event programming  Coding a change into an application at appropriate points is another method that can give intelligent discernment that data changed. Although this method involves programming vs. more easily implemented \\"dumb\\" triggers, it may provide more accurate and desirable CDC, such as only after a COMMIT, or only after certain columns changed to certain values - just what the target system is looking for.  Log scanners  Most database management systems manage a transaction log that records changes made to the database contents and to metadata. By scanning and interpreting the contents of the database transaction log, one can capture the changes made to the database in a non-intrusive manner. Using transaction logs for change data capture offers a challenge in that the structure, contents and use of a transaction log is specific to a database management system. Unlike data access, no standard exists for transaction logs. Most database management systems do not document the internal format of their transaction logs, although some provide programmatic interfaces to their transaction logs (for example: Oracle, DB2, SQL/MP, SQL/MX and SQL Server 2008). Other challenges in using transaction logs for change data capture include: * Coordinating the reading of the transaction logs and the archiving of log files (database management software typically archives log files off-line on a regular basis). * Translation between physical storage formats that are recorded in the transaction logs and the logical formats typically expected by database users (e.g., some transaction logs save only minimal buffer differences that are not directly useful for change consumers). * Dealing with changes to the format of the transaction logs between versions of the database management system. * Eliminating uncommitted changes that the database wrote to the transaction log and later rolled back. * Dealing with changes to the metadata of tables in the database. CDC solutions based on transaction log files have distinct advantages that include: * minimal impact on the database (even more so if one uses log shipping to process the logs on a dedicated host). * no need for programmatic changes to the applications that use the database. * low latency in acquiring changes. * transactional integrity: log scanning can produce a change stream that replays the original transactions in the order they were committed. Such a change stream include changes made to all tables participating in the captured transaction. * no need to change the database schema  Confounding factors  As often occurs in complex domains, the final solution to a CDC problem may have to balance many competing concerns.  Unsuitable source systems  Change data capture both increases in complexity and reduces in value if the source system saves metadata changes when the data itself is not modified. For example, some Data models track the user who last looked at but did not change the data in the same structure as the data. This results in noise in the Change Data Capture.  Tracking the capture  Actually tracking the changes depends on the data source. If the data is being persisted in a modern database then Change Data Capture is a simple matter of permissions. Two techniques are in common use: * Tracking changes using database triggers * Reading the transaction log as, or shortly after, it is written. If the data is not in a modern database, CDC becomes a programming challenge.  Push versus pull  * Push: the source process creates a snapshot of changes within its own process and delivers rows downstream. The downstream process uses the snapshot, creates its own subset and delivers them to the next process. * Pull: the target that is immediately downstream from the source, prepares a request for data from the source. The downstream target delivers the snapshot to the next target, as in the push model.

Manor By AD 1004 St Frideswide's Minster in Oxford held two hides of land at Cutteslowe. St Frideswide's became an Augustinian Priory, which continued to hold Cutteslowe until it was suppressed in 1525. It then passed to Cardinal Wolsey's Cardinal's College until Wolsey's downfall and attainder in 1529. Cardinal's College became King Henry VIII's College until 1545. Cutteslowe changed hands three times before it was bought in about 1588 by William Lenthall, grandfather of the William Lenthall who was Speaker of the Long Parliament. Between 1611 and 1625 John Lenthall sold Cutteslowe to Sir John Walter of Sarsden near Churchill, Oxfordshire. Most of the estate was sold by a later Sir John Walter in 1703, and by 1737 had been acquired by Christ Church, Oxford. Sir John sold about to Dr Robert South who used it to endow his school at Islip, Oxfordshire. Sir John sold most of what remained in 1710 to John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, in whose family it remained until 1811, when George Spencer-Churchill, 6th Duke of Marlborough sold or exchanged his part to Francis Gregory. In 1918 Gregory's granddaughters sold Cutteslowe to the Soden family. The Sodens sold some of the land for development in 1931 and the remainder to Oxford City Council in 1936, which turned it into Cutteslowe Park. Turnpike The main road between Oxford and Banbury passes through Cutteslowe. It was turnpiked in the 18th century and disturnpiked in the 19th century. Cutteslowe Walls Oxfordshire blue plaque notes the site of the former Cutteslowe Walls. Between 1934 and 1959 Cutteslowe was the location of two very contentious barriers, the Cutteslowe Walls, designed to keep council house tenants in the Cutteslowe Estate out of a development of private houses between them and Banbury Road. They were built by a private developer, Clive Saxton‚Äôs Urban Housing Company. The northern wall divided Wolsey Road from Carlton Road, the southern Aldrich Road from Wentworth Road. The walls were nine feet tall and topped with spikes. During the Second World War, a tank whose crew was trying to return from Banbury Road to its base on Elsfield Way took a wrong turn and demolished one of the walls rather than turn back. The wall was rebuilt, but after escalating public protests and several unofficial attempts, the walls were eventually officially demolished after the council bought the land the walls stood on for ¬£1000. A small fragment of the Aldrich Road wall existed in a private garden in Wentworth Road until the 1980s. A blue plaque was erected by the Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board close to the site of the southern wall in 2006.

The house was pulled down in 1810, because, it is said, her ghost gave the locals so much trouble. In reality, the ancient house had become decrepit. Thomas Hardy based Lumsdon on Cumnor in his novel Jude the Obscure. Cumnor includes some houses by Clough Williams-Ellis, the architect most noted for his designs for Portmeirion. His Cumnor houses are some of his earliest commissions, including his first commission, Larkbeare (1903‚Äì04, completed 1907) on Cumnor Hill, designed whilst he was still a student at the Architectural Association School of Architecture. The other examples are Cutts End House (1911, Appleton Road), Hurstcote (1922, Appleton Road), and Larkbeare Cottage (1910, Cumnor Hill; originally a gardener's cottage associated with Larkbeare). He also designed Cumnor Rise Hospital at a similar time to Larkbeare (designed 1903‚Äì04, completed 1907) but this was demolished in the 1990s.

It is sometimes used when referring to the line from Bedford to St Pancras, and not any service in particular. ; Black Five : A LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0. Class of steam locomotive built in the UK, named from their black 'mixed- traffic' livery and 'Class 5' power rating. ; Blood and Custard : The Crimson and Cream livery used on BR's coaches during the 1950s and 60s ; Bobby : A signaller.

Life His mother was from Nepal and his father was from East Bengal. He was born in Orissa between 1890 and 1895. In the early part of his life he was a successful and wealthy businessman. Some time after 1945 he retired from worldly life and took sanyas vows, becoming a monk in the tradition of the Naga Babas, more exactly, in the Anandakara branch of the movement founded by Shankaracharya. He received spiritual teachings from several sources, but his main spiritual practice was Kriya Yoga. Ganesh Baba stated that he received the four Kriya Yoga initiations from Lahiri Mahasaya (at the age of four, in a dream), Sanyal Mahasaya, Tripura Charan Devsharma and SwƒÅmƒ´ ≈öivƒÅnanda Saraswatƒ´. He became well-known to young Westerners visiting India in the 1960s. In the late 1970s he lived at Swayambunath (near Kathmandu) where he received many visitors and gave courses in Kriya Yoga practice. Everyone who met him were impressed and he was held in high esteem by both Indians and Westerners. He was talkative and would spend hours regaling his listeners with what some might call 'tall tales'. Ganesh Baba's teachings incorporated Western scientific concepts. He taught that there is a cyclic cosmic process of involution and evolution, and he developed a system of correspondences - a \\"Cycle of Synthesis\\" - between levels of Kriya Yoga practice, the five koshas, the planets, the kayas, the Yugas, the cakras, the stages of organic evolution and the Jungian psychological types. He left three manuscripts and many volumes of short essays and papers. The longer manuscripts, \\"Search of Self,\\" an unfinished autobiography, \\"Sadhana,\\" a kriya yoga manual, and a detailed essay on his Cycle of Synthesis, are synthesized and updated as The Crazy Wisdom of Ganesh Baba, by Eve Neuhaus (2010). In 1979 he had developed eye cataracts and was going blind. His Western followers arranged for him to visit the U.S.A. for an operation, as a result of which he recovered his sight. Since many of the young Westerners who had met him in India and Nepal were glad to have him in the U.S. he remained there for seven years, teaching Kriya Yoga to small groups on the East Coast and West Coast. He returned to India in 1986. He visited a Kriya Yoga center in France (which was established by his French followers), then went back to India. He died at Nainital on 19 November 1987, and is buried at the Alakha Nath Temple in Bareilly.

Pilliod Jr. (October 20, 1918 ‚Äì April 18, 2016) was an American business executive and diplomat. He was ambassador to Mexico from 1986 to 1989. Biography Pilliod served in World War II from 1942 to 1945 as a pilot in the 20th Air Force. He flew the Boeing B-29 Superfortress over China and Japan. Pilliod was the CEO of the Goodyear tire company from 1974 to 1983. Pillion began his career at Goodyear in 1941 as a trainee, where he worked double shifts and enrolled in management training courses. His first promotion came within a year, when he was chosen to supervise production of fuel tanks for military aircraft. He eventually moved to export sales, living in Panama, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, and England. When Pilliod became CEO in 1974, he faced a major investment decision regarding the radial tire, which today has a market share of near 100%.http://www.jags.org/TechInfo/2001/05May01/tires/historyoftires.htm As a result of his actions, today only Goodyear, of the five biggest U.S. tire firms, remains independent. At the time, the U.S. tire industry built tires based on bias ply technology, dating to 1888. In 1946, Michelin developed the radial tire method of construction, which quickly spread in France, Michelin's home country. Because of its superiority in treadlife, handling, safety from blowouts, and fuel economy, use of this technology quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia. In the U.S., the bias-ply tire construction persisted, caused by tire and automobile manufacturers in America \\"concerned about transition costs.\\"http://www.michelinag.com/Innovating/Radial-vs.-Bias-technology In 1968, Consumer Reports, an influential American magazine, acknowledged the superiority of radial construction, and in 1971 the Lincoln Continental Mark III became the first American made car with standard OEM radial tires.Vaughan, Daniel Conceptcarz.com 1969 Lincoln Continental news, pictures, specifications, and information September 2008 Retrieved July 26, 2015 Radial tires required different methods of construction, and the U.S. manufacturers were not set up to produce this product. Industry estimates of this investment were substantial, and Goodyear eventually invested close to $3 Billion in this new technology.Ajami, Riad; Cool, Karel; Goddard, Jason. \\"International Business Theory and Practice 2nd Edition\\". Page 408. Case Study #1. 15 November 2006. For comparison, Michelin bought competitor Uniroyal-Goodrich in 1989 for just $1.5 Billion. The workforce also needed to be retrained, since radials required greater \\"accuracy and consistency\\" in construction.Tedlow, Richard. \\"Denial: Why Business Leaders Fail to Look Facts in the Face---and What to Do About It\\". Chapter 3. Portfolio Hardcover. 4 March 2010. Despite heavy criticism at the time, Pilliod invested heavily in new factories and tooling to build the radial tire. Sam Gibara, who headed Goodyear from 1996 to 2003, has noted that without the bold action of Pilliod, Goodyear \\"wouldn't be around today.\\" When Pilliod was appointed Ambassador in 1986, the U.S. and Mexico were experiencing tensions over the illegal drug trade. He favored behind the scenes discussions with Mexican authorities about the issue. He wished to improve relations, \\"and you won't do that by bashing\\" he said in 1987.

It has been the home ground of FC Midtjylland since March 2004. An integrated part of the arena is a main building housing the club's administration and offices for the official fan club (named Black Wolves), and includes player and referee facilities, a restaurant, a VIP lounge, press and sky boxes, and a club shop (named Ulveshoppen). The total capacity during domestic matches is 11,432 spectators with 7,070 seatings (western and eastern grand stands and partly north stand) making it the 9th largest football stadium in Denmark. At international FIFA and UEFA matches, the capacity of the four covered single-tiered stands is reduced to 9,430, when the terraces at the north and south stands are converted to an all-seater mode. The stadium's current attendance record of 11,763 spectators dates back to a 2017‚Äì18 Danish Superliga match on 11 November 2007, when FC Midtjylland drew 2‚Äì2 against FC Copenhagen. During the construction period and the first couple of months after the official opening on 27 March 2004, it was called Stadion ved Messecenter Herning (or Messecenter Herning Stadion). On 5 August 2004, it was announced that Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) had acquired the naming rights of the stadium in a sponsorship arrangement, and the stadium was officially known as SAS Arena until 30 June 2009 ‚Äî the first sponsorship of its kind in Denmark. The current name, MCH Arena, was introduced on 1 July 2009. It was one of four venues for the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, staging three matches in Group B and a semi-final. During the competition, the stadium was known as Herning Stadion. Apart from hosting several European Cup matches, the stadium has also staged four friendlies for the Danish national football team. The 2013 European Dressage Championship was held in Herning with the stadium being one of the locations.  History  On 1 November 2000, the CEO of Messecenter Herning A/S (now known as MCH Group A/S), Georg S√∏rensen, presented a comprehensive development plan for the company's upcoming 25 years, named Vision 2025, which also launched the plans for the construction of a stadium. On 29 November 2000, the board of the then-newly founded FC Midtjylland had made the decision to eventually relocate the team to a new contemporary stadium in connection with the exhibition centre in Herning ‚Äî despite great dissatisfaction from one of the team's parents clubs, Ikast FS ‚Äî arguing that a stadium located at Hammerum in between the cities, Herning and Ikast, of the two former rival mother clubs would not have the same possibilities and visions. At a press briefing at Messecenter Herning on 4 February 2003, it was announced that the plans for a more than 10,000-spectator large stadium as part of a major commercial and entertainment complex would become a greenfield project, located south of the existing buildings of exhibition centre, next to 15,000 parking spots and an upcoming highway intersection, and that the stadium and its facilities was entered in to a lease agreement with FC Midtjylland with an annual rent obligation based on a 25-year rental agreement, irrevocable from both parties until the end of 2027, and giving FC Midtjylland exclusive (and commercial) rights to all association football matches in the stadium. Construction of the stadium broke ground on 2 April 2003 at 08:30 CET and was scheduled to be finished in approximately 11 months, costing in the area of 80‚Äì85 million DKK to build. Integrated with the venue's main stand in the western section is a three- storey main building at 5.000 m¬≤, which from the very beginning have been housing the club's administration and offices for the official supporter's club (Black Wolves), along with a double-high foyer, player and referee changing facilities on the main floor, a VIP lounge with a restaurant on the second floor, press rooms on the first floor and sky boxes on the second floor, and a club shop (Ulveshoppen) to the right of the main building. Three red vertical concrete structures highlight the stadium's main entrance. The top floor have commentator-boxes, a platform for cameras and separate VIP rooms. The spectators enter the stadium using four ticket entrances placed in each corner of the sports facility, giving access to the freestanding stairs leading into the stands. The entire stadium covered 17,000 m¬≤ and a total of 7,000 tonnes of concrete was used by the turnkey contractor KPC Byg A/S with Midtconsult A/S as the consulting engineer. The entire grass turf, which had the dimensions of 111 x 72 meters (circa 8,000 m¬≤) and featured a 104 x 65 meters football pitch, was laid by the company Dan Jord (based in Aarhus) i co-operation with Hedeselskabet A/S during the fall of 2003, and allowed to grow firmly in the winter period. 800 m of water pipes and 2,100 m of drainage was installed underneath the grass turf in addition to 27 km of heating pipes with spacing of 30 cm in between. An advanced water sprinkler system was integrated in the grass, which rise above the lawn with an increase of the water pressure. The architects from the Herning-based company Kobra Arkitekter A/S (merged into √Örstiderne Arkitekter A/S in May 2008) sought inspiration from onsite visits at among other Amsterdam ArenA, Philips Stadion and Camp Nou. The corners of the stadium, above the big gates, were closed of to provide a greater feeling of intimacy. The simplicity in both the construction and the use of materials is prevalent, with raw concrete and steel forming the backbone of the stadium. The club specifically asked that the south and north stands be standing-only with seats in red placed only at the main stand and the opposing eastern grand stand ‚Äî with the option of installing seats at the terraces when needed, expandable to 10,500 seats. Depending on demand, the east standing section of the north stand would be reserved for visiting supporters of the guest teams, separating them from the rest of the spectators by a fence, while the home fans and fan club members would occupy the south standing-only stand and also allocated to half of the north stand. The design of the stadium was made with possible expansion at a later date in mind ‚Äî the foundation allows for an increase of the capacity of up to 50,000 spectators and the roof could in such a situation be raised. The roof consisting of black lightweight trapez steel plates, covering all four stands, is carried by large free-standing steel columns provided by the Brabrand-based company Richard Thomsen A/S, creating the only separation against the outside of the stadium. The stadium's official opening competitive match was played on 27 March, when FC Midtjylland faced Akademisk BK in the 2003‚Äì04 Danish Superliga in front of 11,083 spectators, resulting in 6‚Äì0 win with Mohamed Zidan scoring the first goal after five minutes and five goals in total. FC Midtjylland had been playing all their matches in the fall season of 2003 at Ikast Stadium, that had a capacity of 12,000 with a small grand stand of 1,002 seats, at Ikast, now relocating their home ground to Herning. The average attendance was boosted considerably as a result of the new stadium and better performance on the pitch by the players. The first European fixture at the new venue was played on 3 July 2004, when Esbjerg fB and OGC Nice meet in the second round of the 2004 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Due to reconstruction after 2007, the original capacity of the stadium at approximately 12,500 spectators with 7,500 seats was reduced to 11.432 spectators with 7,070 seats. On 16 August 2005, a national football match featuring the Denmark national under-21 football team against an English squad, was played for the first time at the venue.  Name, sponsorships and logos  A view of the stadium from the west showing the grand stand and main building, including the previous MCH Arena sign used between 2009 and 2016. Up until the summer of 2004, the new stadium did not officially have a name and was simply referred to as Stadion ved Messecenter Herning (or Messecenter Herning Stadion), because the owner, MCH, was hoping to sell the name for commercial purposes. On 5 August 2004, Scandinavian Airlines acquired the naming rights to the venue, changing its name to the SAS Arena, becoming the first sponsored football stadium in Denmark. SAS already had the naming rights to the Danish Superliga due to its sponsorship of the league. At the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season the sponsorship expired, and was the stadium's name was changed to MCH Arena (short for MesseCenterHerning). In March 2004, the south end stand was initially named Nordea-tribunen, the north end stand became Steff Houlberg-tribunen, the east grand stand was called Faxe Kondi-tribunen, while the main stand went as Elite Milj√∏-tribunen.

Along the way it intersects several major highways including Route 2 in Erving and Route 10 in Northfield. Route description Route 63 begins at Route 116 at the north end of the UMass Amherst campus. It heads eastward for a third of a mile before turning onto Sunderland Road (the old alignment of Route 116) for fifty yards, before turning onto Montague Road. Montague Road passes through the western side of the town of Leverett, crossing the New England Central Railroad tracks before entering Sunderland for a short distance, crossing the tracks again before entering Montague. It meets the northern end of Route 47 south of Montague Center before passing Lake Pleasant and crossing the tracks twice more before crossing the Millers River at Millers Falls, entering the town of Erving. In Erving, Route 63 passes under Route 2 (the Mohawk Trail) without direct access between the two. Signage on both roads directs traffic along Prospect Street (signed as \\"To 2 East\\" and \\"To 63 South\\") and along Forest Street (signed as \\"To 2 East\\" and \\"To 63 North\\"). Route 63 then heads north into Northfield, passing Northfield Mountain. It joins Route 10 (just east of Bennett's Meadow Bridge over the Connecticut River) for just under , before splitting just south of the New Hampshire state line. It shortly turns northwestward before entering the town of Hinsdale and becoming New Hampshire Route 63.Official Arrow Street Atlas: Western Massachusetts. South Easton, MA: Arrow Map, Inc., 1998. History Route 63 was defined by 1929, running from Route 116 in Sunderland north along current Route 47 into Montague, and then along Sunderland Road, Turners Falls Road and Montague Road towards Turners Falls. South of Turners Falls, it turned east and merged with Route 2 (later Route 2A), which it took to Millers Falls. There it turned north onto its present alignment, ending at Route 10 in Northfield. Ca. 1939, Route 63 was extended south from Sunderland along present Route 47, ending at Route 116 in South Hadley. Around the same time, it was shifted to its current alignment from south of Montague center (where Route 47 now cuts over to Route 63) north to Millers Falls. Finally, also around 1939, New Hampshire Route 10 was shifted onto a shorter route near the state line, resulting in a different crossing of the state line. The former Route 10 became New Hampshire Route 63, and Route 63 was extended north concurrent with Route 10, splitting near the state line along old Route 10. In the late 1940s, Route 63 was shifted east from south of Montague center south to a new terminus at Route 116 in Amherst; the old route became Route 47. Finally, a new alignment of Route 116 west of Amherst center was built in 1958, and Route 63 was extended slightly west at its south end to the bypass.

He is currently Professor of Sustainability at Curtin UniversityCurtin University: Staff Profiles, retrieved 19 August 2010 and was awarded an Order of Australia for sustainable transport and urban design in 2014. Newman has written 20 books and over 330 papers on sustainable cities and is most known for creating the term \\"automobile dependence\\" in the second half of the 1980s. He was closely associated with community opposition to the closure of the Fremantle Railway in 1979 and subsequent redevelopment of the metropolitan rail system from 1983 to the present. He is a lead author for transport on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He has a PhD degree in Chemistry (1972, University of Western Australia) and completed post doctoral studies in Environmental Science, Delft University, Dip EST, Environmental Science, 1972. Career and influence Newman is best known internationally for popularizing the term ‚Äòautomobile dependence‚Äô in the second half of the 1980s to explain how the cities of the time based on sprawling suburbs were inevitably leading to the growth in automobile use. He led an international research project with colleague Jeff Kenworthy on transport practices and structures (original data collected on 33 global cities). The results were published in Cities and Automobile Dependence: An International Sourcebook, which introduced the concept of car dependence ‚Äì now a feature of planning literature and policy. The two researchers later collaborated on the book Sustainability and Cities: Overcoming Automobile Dependence which was launched in the White House in 1999, as the President's Council on Sustainable Development was moving toward a more urban focus, and more recently The End of Automobile Dependence: How Cities are Moving Beyond Car-based Planning. In Cities as Sustainable Ecosystems: Principles and Practices written with Isabella Jennings, Newman shows how city residents can begin to reintegrate into their bioregional environment, and how cities themselves can be planned with ecological sustainability in mind. Drawing on examples from many parts of the world, the authors show how urban redevelopment in some cities has involved harvesting rainwater, greening roofs, and producing renewable energy. Other cities have biodiversity parks for endangered species, community gardens that support a connection to their foodshed, and pedestrian-friendly spaces that encourage walking and cycling.

The hospital is dedicated mainly to Pulmonary care medicine, being the biggest hospital of this speciality in Portugal. History A plan by architectural landscaper Francisco Caldeira Cabral and an architectural project authored by Vasco Morais Palmeiro Regaleira was established in 1947. The DGEMN Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (General Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments) was involved in public works between 25 April 1928 and 27 April 1953 resulting in the expansion, remodeling and adaption of the hospital. As part of these plans, in 1951, construction began on a preventorium and re- organization of the operating block, by the Direc√ß√µes dos Servi√ßos de Constru√ß√£o e Conserva√ß√£o (Directorates for Construction and Conservation Services). Five years later, construction began on an experimental pavilion, that included 60 beds, in addition to conservation projects and work on the kitchen by the Directorates. The following year work began on the first wing of a new sanitorium, which continued in the next year. The completed work included the completion of a crematorium, the execution of the a major part of the civil construction work, remodeling and expansion of the Radiology Services and sanitarium's Surgery block. Work began on the Servi√ßos Industriais (Industrial Service) block, that included laboratory, pharmacy services, and deposits; installation of the distribution channels for electricity to many of the buildings, including transformation post, along with accesses and exterior landscaping. In addition, the chapel in the sanitorium was refurbished. In 1959, equipment and furniture were installed for the satellite unit of the sanitorium, by the Comiss√£o para Aquisi√ß√£o de Mobili√°rio (Furniture Acquisition Commission). In 1961, during phase two of the public project, saw expansion of pathological anatomy block, cardiology and operator rooms, improvements of the central heating and conservation work on the Lambert de Morais Pavilion, by the Servi√ßos de Constru√ß√£o e de Conserva√ß√£o. The extinction of the Pulmonary Emergency block, after a political decision in 1997, left the hospital without the possibility of using a specialized facility. The crisis in the Pulmonary Care Medicine Department, resulted in a reduction of staff and the exit of junior physicians caused by the restructuring in the National Health Care System in 2003. On 24 August 2006, the building was undergoing heritage classification, under the terms of the transitional regime, under Article 1.1 of Decree 173/2006 (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie 1, 16), but it expired before the limits of Article 24, Decree 107/2001 (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie-1A, 209) on 8 September 2001.

As an artist he chose to be known as Erich Chiram Brauer. He often signed his art work \\"Chiram\\". Early life He was born in Berlin to Fanny (Krebs) and Adolf Brauer, when it was part of the German Empire under Prussian leadership. As a young man, his first interest was in graphics, and later he added studies in ethnology., p. 61 Even after he had changed his vocation, he would still decorate his letters and writings with graphic artwork and would later make a livelihood from doing graphic artwork for the Jewish National Fund. In Germany, Brauer belonged to a Jewish youth movement, youth primarily drawn from assimilated Jewish families who had taken an interest in Zionism, and which called themselves Jung Juda (Young Judea). One of the fellow members of this group whom he had befriended was Gershom Scholem., p. 72 During the years of the First World War, 1915-1916, the two co-edited and published a lithographic magazine entitled, Die Blauweisse Brille (\\"Glasses in Blue and White\\"), in which three issues (50-100 lithographed copies) were printed in the printing press owned by Scholem's father, and which treated on the war from a Zionist-Jewish perspective, but written with a comical and humorous flair. Brauer is noted there for his expressionist style., p. 73 Education and vocation Erich Brauer completed his dissertation in 1924 at the University of Leipzig on the religion of the Herero of South-West Africa.Vered Madar & Dani Schrire, \\"From Leipzig to Jerusalem: Erich Brauer, a Jewish Ethnographer in Search of a Field\\", pub. in: Naharaim 8 (1), Tel-Aviv University 2014, p. 92 The Folklore Museum of Leipzig sent Brauer to British Mandate Palestine in 1925 to collect ethnological artifacts of the Arabs living in the country. Although Brauer returned to Germany, Brauer would leave his native Germany in later life to settle permanently in British Mandate Palestine where he resided in Tel-Aviv, and afterwards in Jerusalem.; (Hebrew: ◊ê◊ï◊®◊ô◊™ ◊ê◊ë◊ï◊î◊ë, '◊§◊†◊ô ◊ê◊ì◊ù: ◊¢◊ú ◊™◊®◊ï◊û◊™◊ù ◊©◊ú ◊î◊ê◊™◊†◊ï◊ú◊ï◊í◊ô◊ù ◊ê◊®◊ô◊ö ◊ë◊®◊ê◊ï◊ê◊® ◊ï◊®◊§◊ê◊ú ◊§◊ò◊ê◊ô ◊ú◊ó◊ß◊® ◊î◊ê◊†◊™◊®◊ï◊§◊ï◊ú◊ï◊í◊ô◊î ◊©◊ú ◊î◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊ô◊ù', ◊û◊ó◊ß◊®◊ô ◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ú◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊§◊ï◊ú◊ß◊ú◊ï◊® ◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊ô, ◊õ\\"◊ë,2004 . ◊¢◊û' 159 ‚Äì 178) In the early 1930s, Brauer returned to Germany to publish his newly written book in German, Ethnologie der jemenitischen Juden (Ethnology of Yemenite Jews), which was finally published in Heidelberg in 1934, under the Nazi regime. That same year, he was also awarded a Lord Plumer scholarship in recognition of his outstanding work in the field of anthropology. This enabled him to work as a research associate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, a post which he held for four years. In spite of his efforts, Brauer failed to make anthropology an area of academic interest at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, but was only able to garner support for his own private research. When the University could no longer pay for his continued research in the field of anthropology, Brauer continued to conduct private research in the field, until illness forced him to stop. Contributions to ethnology Brauer is the author of two major books, one of which treating on the Jews of Yemen (Ethnologie der jemenitischen Juden), and the other on the Jews of Kurdistan, a book later translated into English and Turkish. These two works are his most popular monographs, while his other works are articles written for various publications. On Brauer and on his first monograph, Shelomo Dov Goitein wrote with a sense of profound awe and affection: ‚ÄúBrauer was educated and trained in the Berlin school of ethnology, which was known for its acclaim at that time; he was a sharp-eyed investigator, and a man gifted with a deep humanity and wisdom. In addition to this, he was an outstanding draftsman and an excellent photographer. He was methodical and thorough. His book [on Yemenite Jewry] is considered a literary work that is a masterpiece in its field.‚ÄùShelomo Dov Goitein, The Yemenites ‚Äì History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life (Selected Studies), editor: Menahem Ben-Sasson, Jerusalem 1983, p. 10 Brauer's pioneering status, as reflected in his research on the Jews of Yemen and the Jews of Kurdistan, are recognized as milestones in the study of these communities in Israel, where he is considered one of the forefathers of local anthropology as it developed in Mandate Palestine.Vered Madar & Dani Schrire, \\"From Leipzig to Jerusalem: Erich Brauer, a Jewish Ethnographer in Search of a Field\\", pub. in: Naharaim 8 (1), Tel-Aviv University 2014, p. 92 Brauer suffered from a rare illness (Scheuermann's disease) and died at the age of 46 in Petah Tikvah, and was buried in Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery in Givatayim. At his death, Brauer left behind him five original diaries, the transcripts of which were permanently deposited at the National Library of Israel by the Israel Ethnographic Society in 1975, as well as photocopies of texts and of a drawing. Goitein wrote a moving eulogy of the man upon his death, published in the book Shev≈´t Teiman (1945),Shev≈´th Teiman, ed.

It is fed and drained by the River Tummel, which flows into the River Tay about south-east of the Clunie Dam at the loch's eastern end.Ordnance Survey. Explorer Map 1:25000. Sheet OL49, Pitlochry & Loch Tummel. The loch is traversed by roads to both north and south. Along the northern side the road is numbered as the B8019, and runs from the Pass of Killiecrankie on the A9 in the east to Tummel Bridge at the head of the loch. The road on the southern side is unclassified, and meets the A9 further south, near to Pitlochry. The loch gives its name to the Loch Tummel National Scenic Area (NSA), one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection by restricting certain forms of development. The Loch Tummel Lyon NSA covers , all of which lies within Perth and Kinross. The NSA covers the hills surrounding the loch, and extends along the River Tummel to also take in the area surrounding the Pass of Killiecrankie on the River Garry. Leisure and tourism Loch Tummel is popular with anglers who fish for brown trout and pike. Fishing is managed by the Loch Rannoch Conservation Association, who issue permits and control catches. Loch Tummel Sailing Club is based at Foss on the south west shore of the loch. The loch is also very popular with campers during the spring and summer.Tom Weir. The Scottish Lochs. pp. 77. Published by Constable and Company, 1980. The roads on either side of the loch both offer splendid views of the surrounding countryside, especially from the well-known 'Queen's View' from the north shore, which was made famous by Queen Victoria in 1866. This viewpoint offers a magnificent vista over the loch with Schiehallion in the background. It is also claimed that the view was originally named after Queen Isabel, wife of Robert the Bruce, who is said to have hidden in the nearby woods after the Bruce's defeat at the Battle of Methven in 1306. Areas of forestry around Loch Tummel owned by Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) form part of the Tay Forest Park, a network of FLS forests spread across the Highland parts of Perthshire that are managed to provide walks and amenities for visitors. Nature and conservation The River Tummel is tributary of the River Tay, and Loch Tummel is included as part of the River Tay Special Area of Conservation. The designation notes the river system's importance for salmon, otters, brook lampreys, river lampreys and sea lampreys. Brown trout and pike are also present in the loch. The woods to the north of the loch are home to a number of protected species, including capercaillie, black grouse, red squirrel, pearl-bordered fritillary and juniper. Hydro-electricity Loch Tummel from the Queen's View in about 1895. Note the lower water level when compared to the modern image. Loch Tummel became part of the Tummel Hydro-Electric Power Scheme when the Clunie Dam was constructed by Wimpey Construction at its eastern end in 1950, raising the water level by . Prior to this the loch, which is now approximately long and just under wide was much smaller, being long and wide. Water from Loch Tummel is diverted to Loch Faskally, running via Clunie power station, which has a vertical head of and a total generating capacity of 61 MW. There is also a power station at Tummel Bridge at the western end of the loch that takes water from Dunalastair reservoir below Loch Rannoch, and discharges into Loch Tummel: this station has a vertical head of and a total generating capacity of 34 MW. Historical sites The northern side of the loch has many archeological sites, including an Iron Age ring fort, abandoned townships, and the remains of Pictish fortified villages. This area also includes the standing stones of Clachan Aoraidh, located at the head of Glen Fincastle in the Allean Forest. Fincastle House, a 17th-century Category A listed building, sits at the eastern end of the strath. The raising of the loch for hydroelectricity led to the drowning of an artificial island of a type known as a crannog lying off Port an Eilean on the northern side of the loch. The island is now 3 m underwater, and was investigated by the Scottish Trust for Underwater Archaeology and Perth & Kinross Heritage Trust in 2004. A well-made flagstone floor and a flight of steps that led down a distance of 2 m to the loch bed were found. Analysis of one the timbers found on the site revealed that it dated from around 1840. Above the head of the loch, there are two bridges over the River Tummel at Tummel Bridge. The original humpbacked bridge was built by General Wade in about 1734 as part of his construction of some of roads and 30 bridges in Scotland between 1725 and 1737. A modern replacement alongside Wade's bridge carries the traffic from Aberfeldy on the B846 road. The historic drove road of the Road to the Isles leaves Wade's military road at Tummel Bridge, from where it heads west into Lochaber, and Tummel is one of the places mentioned in the Scottish folk song named after the road.

The farm consists of a ca. 1740 farmhouse, a stone barn (the oldest standing in West Virginia), a springhouse of about the same age, a wooden curing shed, and 60+ acres of pasture and woods. The farm is one of the oldest in the county and has a rich history. History In May 1740, Dr. John McCormick, a Scots-Irish immigrant, purchased from Jost Hite, a German land developer who had obtained 30,000 acres (120 km¬≤) from John and Isaac Van Metre. By 1742, Dr. McCormick had built a three-story stone farmhouse. He was a prosperous and prominent country doctor, as evidenced by the inventory of his estate completed upon his death in 1768. He and his wife Ann had six sons (James, Francis, John Jr., William, George, and Andrew) and two daughters (Mary, wife of Magnus Tate, and Jean, wife of James Byrn). George Washington completed a survey of McCormick's land in 1752 and James McCormick served as the chain carrier and John Jr. as the pilot on several of George Washington's early surveys. White House Farm was noted for the horses bred there during Dr. McCormick's lifetime. Upon Dr. McCormick's death in 1768, the farm was bequeathed to his youngest son, Andrew. During the Revolutionary War, Andrew and his wife Nancy provided food, lodging, and horses to Washington's troops. After the war, Andrew apparently operated an inn on the farm, for he paid for an \\"ordinary\\" license on February 18, 1794. For such an endeavor, the site benefited from its location on the most direct route between Frederick, Maryland and Winchester, Virginia. On September 9, 1807, Andrew sold the farm to John Locke and John's brother George managed the ordinary, which had become known as White House Tavern. By 1845, Eleanor Locke, John's daughter, was living in the house with her husband, Joseph Morrow, a farmer who also operated a blacksmith shop across the road near the springhouse during the Civil War. During the Civil War, Major Harry Gilmor, Confederate States Army and his men were attacked by a group of Union soldiers led by Captain George Somers as the Confederates were resting in front of the house. Major Gilmor shot and killed Captain Somers as his men took cover behind the barn. The house was renovated in the late 1800s by the Morrows and subsequent owners added a few rooms. Between 1929 and 1940 the farm was owned by Luther and Lelia Naylor, who converted the stone stable into a milking barn and constructed a silo. The black and white photograph shows the house as it appeared in the 1930s. This dairy operation continued until about 1950 when Col. and Mrs. Edward Blake purchased the property, which was passed on to John and Alice Blake Van Tol in 1974.

He was an associate of the notorious Louis Buchalter and part of Buchalter's criminal organization known as Murder, Inc. during the 1930s and up to the time of his arrest in 1941. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics claimed that Weiss and his partner in crime Philip \\"Little Farvel\\" Cohen were heavily involved in narcotics trafficking. Although he was indicted on multiple drug charges, Weiss was never sentenced for any of these crimes. Career Starting as an enforcer for the labor rackets run by Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter in 1923, Weiss rose to become one of Buchalter's most trusted associates. Weiss was active in Buchalter's lucrative garment industry rackets and once Buchalter and Jacob Shapiro became fugitives from justice in 1937 Weiss took over the post as the acting general manager and was left in charge of payrolls and finance. Buchalter continued to direct the outfit regardless. The Dutch Schultz murder Weiss personally took part in a number of high- profile contract killings for the National Crime Syndicate. On October 23, 1935 he and Charles \\"the Bug\\" Workman walked into the Palace Chophouse in Newark, New Jersey, to murder Dutch Schultz. Weiss went up to the barman and waiters and requested them to lie down on the floor. At the same time Workman walked past Weiss and opened fire on Schultz and his three associates. All of them were fatally injured and died of their bullet wounds within a few hours or days. Immediately after the shootings, Weiss, fearing the imminent arrival of police, fled the scene and jumped into the waiting getaway car. He ordered their getaway driver, Seymour \\"Piggy\\" Schechter, to drive off without Workman, who was still finishing off Schultz in the restaurant's restroom. As a result of his being left behind, Workman was forced to travel back toward New York alone, on foot. The next day, Workman filed a complaint to the \\"board\\" of Murder, Inc. that he had been abandoned by Weiss and Piggy at the murder scene, an offense punishable by death. Weiss defended himself by arguing that Workman had returned to the men's room not for the purpose of making sure the job had been completed (as Workman claimed), but simply for the purpose of stealing Schultz's money and other belongings. Therefore, argued Weiss, the job was already done and Workman had chosen to remain at the scene strictly for selfish personal reasons, thereby jeopardizing their escape and increasing their risk of capture. In the end it was Louis Buchalter who was able to save his lieutenant Weiss from being killed by the mob. The Joseph Rosen murder case On September 13, 1936 Weiss, along with Louis Capone, Sholem Bernstein, Philip \\"Little Farvel\\" Cohen, James Ferraco and Harry \\"Pittsburgh Phil\\" Strauss, took part in the murder of Brownsville, Brooklyn candy store owner Joseph Rosen. Buchalter had ordered the murder in order to prevent Rosen, whom Buchalter had earlier forced out of the garment trucking business, from making good on a threat to expose Buchalter and his rackets to prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey. Previously unpublished crime scene photos of the Rosen candy store murder appear in the book New York City Gangland. Reprinted from This crime eventually proved to be the undoing of Buchalter, Weiss, and Louis Capone, a Buchalter lieutenant who helped to set up and carry out the murder. Arrest and conviction The Rosen murder went unsolved for nearly four years. Since the police knew of no connections between Rosen and the mob, and, moreover, knew of no enemies Rosen may have had, police had no leads at first. Police finally learned of the mob link to the slaying in 1940, when Abe \\"Kid Twist\\" Reles, a fellow Murder, Inc. enforcer, turned informant for Brooklyn district attorney William O'Dwyer. Reles implicated Weiss and colleagues in this murder and helped police clear up numerous other unsolved murders as mob \\"hits\\". Fleeing to Kansas City, Weiss, under the name of James W. Bell, posed as a mining company executive but was arrested by narcotic agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in April 1941 and returned to New York, where he was formally charged with Rosen's murder. In late 1941, Buchalter, Weiss and Capone stood trial by jury, in the Brooklyn courtroom of Judge Franklin Taylor, for the first-degree murder of Joseph Rosen. The information provided by Reles and other mob turncoats, such as Allie \\"Tick-Tock\\" Tannenbaum and Max Rubin, resulted in a guilty verdict and sentence of death for each of the three defendants. On Saturday night, March 4, 1944, Weiss, Capone and Buchalter were executed by electric chair at Sing Sing for the Rosen murder. Weiss's last words before his execution were: > ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here on a framed-up case. And Governor Dewey knows it. I want to thank > Judge Lehman . . . He knows me because I am a Jew. Give my love to my family > . . . and everything.‚ÄùJay Robert Nash: Bloodletters and badmen: a narrative > encyclopedia of American criminals from the Pilgrims to the present, M. > Evans and Co., 1995, p. 109.

Today, a local variant of the Book of Common Prayer is used in the simplified English of the Good News Bible and with similar illustrations. A conundrum for the church has been the question of an appropriate common liturgical language in the Papua New Guinean environment of radical, even extreme, multiculturalism. New Guinea Pidgin is an official language of the country and is spoken and understood by more Papua New Guineans than any other, but it is little known in the Anglican heartland of Oro and Milne Bay Provinces. An anglophone Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea hymn book was published in the early 1980s which contains a strictly limited number of hymns from a variety of traditions. Christmas pageant in a Port Moresby Anglican church mid-1990s The churchmanship of the Province, as demonstrated by the Papua New Guinea Prayer Book, is Anglo-Catholic: the normative Sunday service is the Eucharist, commonly referred to as \\"Mass\\"; Mattins is virtually unknown; clergy are addressed as \\"Father\\" (there are no women clergy). Religious orders ‚Äî the Melanesian Brothers and the Anglican Franciscans ‚Äî play a considerable role in the life of the church. Oro tapa cloth is a characteristic feature of church decoration and liturgical vestments, as befits a denomination substantially characterised by Oro people, and church festivals are often marked by congregants appearing in traditional Oro dress, with Oro drumming and singing. Ecumenical relations The Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea participates in the Melanesian Council of Churches and despite the obviously closer social and religious ties of overseas Anglicans with overseas equivalents of the United Church maintains especially close ties with the Evangelical Lutheran and Roman Catholic churches. With both the Lutherans and Roman Catholics the Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea has entered into formal mutual recognition of baptism and Anglican Papua New Guineans seeking membership in the Roman Catholic Church therefore not submit to conditional baptism as in some other parts of the world.Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea Diocese of Port Moresby News Pages.

Distributed by King Features Syndicate, Tiger began May 3, 1965. At its peak, it was published internationally in some 400 newspapers. Biography Bud Blake's Tiger (August 21, 2001) Blake was born and raised in Nutley, New Jersey.\\"Julian Blake, 87, Comic Strip Artist, Dies\\", The New York Times, December 30, 2005. His father, George Blake, was art director of the Batten Co., a forerunner of Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn. Bud's sister became an illustrator for children's books. Dropping out of high school before his graduation, Blake worked as a demonstrator for a pen-knife company, carving portraits from balsa wood. After selling cartoons to Judge magazine, Blake enrolled in New York's National Academy of Design, supporting himself with odd jobs until 1937, when he landed a paste-up position with the Kudner Advertising Agency. He stayed there until 1954, except for his World War II military service with the U.S. Army infantry. After his return, he eventually rose to become an executive art director with Kudner. Tired of the traveling and heavy responsibility that his job entailed, Blake left advertising to pursue cartooning. He told an interviewer, \\"Kudner was very good to me. I wasn‚Äôt mad at them. They couldn‚Äôt believe that I was quitting. I can‚Äôt give you the details, but they offered me a hell of a lot of money.\\" King Features was looking for a cartoonist to do a cartoon similar to H. T. Webster's panel series, as Webster had recently died. Blake was hired to draw this series, which ran from 1954 to 1965 under a variety of titles (\\"Home Sweet Home,\\" \\"Growing Pains,\\" \\"Ever Happen to You?'\\"). left Bud Blake and his family spent three months living in Spain, where he drew his new feature, but the international mails proved so unreliable that he eventually returned to the States. Many of his originals had gotten lost in the mail. Blake's clients would eventually include advertising firms and such magazines as Business Week and Family Circle. He drew \\"Ever Happen to You?\\" until 1964. He was approached by King Features to create a comic strip that would rival Peanuts, and Tiger was born on May 3, 1965. Blake drew the strip until he was 85, two years before his death. After Blake retired, the strip continued to appear as reprints, and as of December 2005, according to the syndicate, Tiger was running in more than 100 newspapers in 11 countries. Widowed in 1988, Blake spent his final years at Damariscotta, Maine. He died at the Maine Medical Center in Portland, Maine, survived by his son Jay, a physicist, and daughter Marianna, an artist. Awards The National Cartoonists Society named Tiger the Best Humor Strip in 1970 and 1978. It won the society's Best Newspaper Strip award in 2000, receiving another nomination in 1998.

LVCR was not limited to the Channel Islands, and continues to apply to all low- valued imports into the EU from other countries outside of the EU. Background= Low-value consignment relief  When goods are imported into the EU from a non-EU territory, they are generally subject to a VAT (currently 20% in the UK for most goods). However, as a result of EU Council Directive 2009/132/EC, an optional exception is allowed on shipments of a low value to speed up the transit of low value goods which might otherwise be delayed by customs and also reduce the cost of tax collection where it might not be practicable. This administrative relief is known as low-value consignment relief (LVCR). Member states which allow the relief must ensure that it does not cause competitive distortion or allow VAT abuse. The maximum allowed value of the goods for which the exception applies is set by the importing state, and can be between ‚Ç¨10 and ‚Ç¨22.Council Directive 2009/132/EC of 19 October 2009 determining the scope of Article 143(b) and (c) of Directive 2006/112/EC as regards exemption from value added tax on the final importation of certain goods The UK currently sets the limit to ¬£15 for commercial goods. United Kingdom The United Kingdom is a member of the EU and, as a member state is obliged to apply VAT to a range of goods (see European Union value added tax). Total online retail spending online grew by 33.4% in 2007 to a record ¬£10.9bn and UK online sales are predicted to reach ¬£28.1bn by 2011 ‚Äì 8.9% of all retail sales.The second gold rush ‚Äì The Scotsman.

The reasons for the success of internet retail are varied, covering factors related to convenience, time saving, breadth of choice, and price. With reference to online music sales in particular, it has been noted that the low price offered by online retailers such as Play.com, Amazon.co.uk, TheHutgroup.com and HMV plays a significant factor in these sites' popularity. A study by the Kantar Group found that in 2009 there was an 18% increase in the volume of online CD sales. Many or most of these were shipped from the Channel Islands, although they are almost always controlled by UK-registered parent companies. Furthermore, Kantar found that 95% of such sales are low enough that VAT charges were not applied to them. Channel Islands The Channel Islands consist of the Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey, Crown dependencies which are self-governing but historically linked to the Crown. The Channel Islands have a special relationship with the United Kingdom as set out in Protocol 3 to the United Kingdom's Act of Accession 1972, which formed part of the Treaty of Accession. Under this agreement the Channel Islands are not part of the European Union but are part of the customs territory of the union. This means they do not charge VAT on purchases but there is a free movement of industrial and agricultural goods in trade between the Islands and the Union. Jersey introduced a Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 3% in 2008 which increased to 5% in 2011 on the majority of goods and services supplied in Jersey for local use, including imports, GST can be claimed back on exports. Historical documentation indicates that LVCR was originally allowed by the UK for the Channel Islands in order to expedite Jersey and Guernsey grown agricultural goods such as fresh flowers and daily mail that would have been damaged by the delay caused in VAT processing.\\"1997 VAT Assurance Review of The Channel Islands\\" (\\"Island suppliers were concerned that the introduction of VAT from 1 April 1973 would result in perishable goods, namely cut flowers and cream, not being delivered to customers in peak condition\\")Tolley's VAT guides More recent documents, including a 2006 States of Jersey Scrutiny Panel, have challenged this claim.Jersey Economic Affairs Scrutiny Panel ‚Äì Impact of The Fulfilment Industry On the Local Economy However, in more recent years the Channel Islands have been used as a convenient location for selling goods VAT-free into the UK by mail order. Historically, the bulk of mail order goods sold through the Channel Islands were manufactured in the UK, exported to the Islands and then mailed back into the UK VAT-free. As businesses based in the Channel Islands have become more sophisticated, however, goods are now imported from the Far East, including electronics and accessories. In a written answer to Janet Dean MP on 18 June 2008 the then Financial Secretary to the Treasury Jane Kennedy stated that three quarters of the VAT avoided due to LVCR \\"is attributable to imports from the Crown dependencies\\".House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 18 Jun 2008 (pt 0016). Publications.parliament.uk. Retrieved on 19 September 2013. Current status In recent years, retailers, politicians and academics in the United Kingdom have claimed that this situation affords an unfair and damaging economic advantage to retailers based in the Channel Islands. These retailers are able to offer the same products as UK retailers but at significantly lower prices. The advantage was highlighted by Matt Moulding, CEO of The Hut Group, who was quoted in The Guardian as saying \\"If you aren't offshore you couldn't possibly compete. Your cost price would be above what people would be retailing at.\\"Guardian Article ‚Äì March 2009 The book Last Shop Standing by Graham Jones (one of the founders of Music Distributor Proper Distribution) details the detrimental effect VAT-free mail order has had on UK music retail, whilst specialist Internet retailers such as freakemporium.com have cited VAT-free mail order as the main factor in their demise.The Freak Emporium. The Freak Emporium. Retrieved on 19 September 2013. Specific products The Channel Islands require DVDs sold there to be certified by the British Board of Film Classification and therefore only British-certified DVDs are available from the Channel Islands. CDs are often licensed to specific territories and record companies strongly defend their regional licensing arrangements, as has been shown by the BPI action against play.com when they tried to bring in major label VAT-free CDs from outside the EU. Memory cards are subject to similar licence arrangements as CDs and DVDs, so the majority of memory cards sold in the Channel Islands are supplied through EU distributors. Business response Some UK businesses have claimed that this kind of VAT avoidance is potentially \\"abusive\\", in terms characterised by the 2006 Halifax Judgement. VAT abuse is defined as transactions that, \\"notwithstanding formal application of the conditions laid down by the relevant provisions of the Sixth Directive and of national legislation transposing it, result in the accrual of a tax advantage the grant of which would be contrary to the purpose of those provisions. Second, it must also be apparent from a number of objective factors that the essential aim of the transactions concerned is to obtain a tax advantage.\\" In 2005 a group of UK retailers with the help of the UK trade body the Forum of Private Business gave evidencehttp://www.scrutiny.gov.je/documents/evidence/37591-38482-2262006.pdf to the All-Party Parliamentary Small Shops Group. This group published in 2006 a report High Street Britain 2015 that covered many issues affecting retail in the UK. In relation to LVCR and the Channel Islands it recommended that \\"The UK Government should immediately apply the lowest threshold applicable for the relief of low value consignments permissible in the directive, which is currently 10 euros (approximately ¬£7) ‚Äì this would eliminate the vast majority of exploiting trade almost immediately\\" it also recommended that \\"The enforcement, by government bodies like Customs and Excise, of VAT should be reviewed to ensure a level playing field\\" Another group of retailers, called the Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes (RAVAS) have filed a complaint with the EU Directorate of Taxation, alleging that the UK Government has breached the Directive covering LVCR by failing to take action to stop abuse. They say that the UK Government could have stopped the growth of LVCR trade by taking legal action against major retailers under Halifax, or by using its discretion to lower the threshold to ‚Ç¨10, remove mail order goods from the relief or request the Channel Islands lose the right to benefit from the relief in relation to DVDs and CDs which is known as a 'derogation'. http://www.scrutiny.gov.je/documents/reports/36460-45783-2552006.htm The retailers argue that by failing to stop abuse of LVCR the UK Government is in breach of the Principal VAT Directive (previously the Sixth VAT Directive) which states that the conditions for EU tax exemptions such as LVCR should be laid down \\"for the purposes of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of those exemptions\\" and to prevent any \\"possible evasions, avoidance or abuse\\". Government reaction=United Kingdom Due to pressure from UK retailers and trade body the Forum of Private Business (FPB), the Government of the United Kingdom mentioned the LVCR issue in the 2006 Budget wherein they stated \\"In 1984, a VAT-free threshold on imports of small commercial consignments from outside the EU was introduced at a level of ¬£18, as an administrative relief. The Government is aware that this provision is currently being exploited the relief now costs the Exchequer around ¬£85 million per year. If the relief continues to be exploited by businesses using offshore locations, the Government will consider changes to prevent this type of behaviour\\". However, the UK Government took no direct action, leaving the Channel Islands governments to regulate the trade internally. The UK Government stated that any action to stop the LVCR trade would damage the UK post office.House of Commons Hansard Debates for 01 Nov 2006 (pt 0011). Parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk. Retrieved on 19 September 2013. In early 2010 the UK Treasury issued a statement to The Guardian that said \\"The implication that businesses are simply setting up on the Channel Islands to take advantage of this relief is not true. In fact exports from the Channel Islands account for a very small percentage of the CD/DVD market\\". Significant lobbying by UK retailers affected by LVCR was reported widely on the BBC in 2011. In 2011 the UK Treasury announced that from 1 April 2012, LVCR would no longer apply to goods imported from the Channel Islands. It was announced on 4 October 2012 that Condor Logistics would close its operations with the loss of about 180 jobs (110 in the UK, 50 in Jersey and 20 in Guernsey). The move was blamed on changes to LVCR affecting the Channel Islands.Condorgroup: \\"Following loss of LVCR, Condor Group to close logistics business\\" also webcite backup of same Jersey The Channel Islands have no say over the operation of Low Value Consignment Relief as they are not members of the EU and the relief is granted to the importer of the goods and not the exporter. However, the Channel Islands, whilst having no direct influence on the tax policies of the UK government, do regularly discuss taxation issues with the UK Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs as proven by the discussions that took place in 2006 regarding Jersey's new Fulfilment Industry Policy.http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/documents/statements/19375-40005-8112006.htm Like all EU tax regimes, LVCR is ultimately policed by the EU. Jersey's Economic Development Minister Philip Ozouf Jr announced in March 2006 a New Jersey Fulfilment Policy intended to govern the fulfilment industry in the Island and stated that companies who export to the UK by mail order must first obtain a licence. He argued that this was to ensure that the Island was not taken advantage of by UK business and that tangible economic benefits would remain in the Island. In 2007 owing to the bad press generated by the expansion of the fulfilment industry in the Channel Islands, the government of Jersey announced that it had asked certain UK retailers to cease their operations there and that no further licences would be granted for CD and DVD retailers. The refusal to grant further licences was only applied to CDs and DVDs ‚Äì an industry that is almost entirely based offshore in the Channel Islands already ‚Äì and licences for other products have not yet been controlled to the same degree. Guernsey Guernsey has, like Jersey, taken steps to protect its international reputation and protect the viability of the fulfilment industry in the Bailiwick. In 2007 a Review of the Bulk mail export of DVDs and CDs under the LVCR arrangements was announced by the Commerce & Employment Department along with the formation of the Guernsey Mail Order and Fulfilment Group which is made up of retailers and fulfilment operators based in the Bailiwick. In 2008 the Fulfilment Group together with the Guernsey authorities created a Code of Conduct which remains unavailable on the internet but can be obtained from the Guernsey Commerce and Employment Department of the States of Guernsey. The Code is voluntary and acknowledges that in the UK there has been some cause for concern with regards to the relocation of UK companies to the Channel Islands to benefit from the LVCR concession, in particular with the CD and DVD market. It looks to address these concerns through the mutual co-operation of the Guernsey Mail Order and Fulfilment Group and lays down similar trade restrictions to those covered by the Jersey Licence Scheme although unlike that scheme, the only sanction available to those breaking the code appears to be exclusion from the Fulfilment Group. The Guernsey authorities also claim that three of the largest retailers on the Island have agreed to voluntary caps on the amount of VAT that they can avoid by way of LVCR.

Although he was active in the world of politics and commerce, Anthony the father also belonged to the Third Order of Saint Francis and was known for his generosity. His mother, Isabel Leite de Barros, was from a farming family, and was a great-granddaughter of the famous bandeirante explorer Fern√£o Dias Pais, known as the \\"Emerald Hunter\\". She gave birth to eleven children before her premature death in 1755, at age 38. Equally known for her generosity, Isabel was found to have given away all of her clothes to the poor at the time of her death. At age 13, Galv√£o was sent to the Jesuit-run seminary Col√©gio de Bel√©m in Cachoeira, Bahia by his father, which wished to provide Humanities and cultural training to his son. He followed his brother Jos√©, who was already studying there. At Col√©gio de Bel√©m, which he attended from 1752 to 1756, Galv√£o made great progress in social studies and Christian practice. He aspired to become a Jesuit priest, but the anti-Jesuit persecution led by Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, the Marquis of Pombal, led him to enter the Franciscan Order instead. in Taubat√©, following the advice of his father.

During his novitiate year, he was known for his piety, zeal and exemplary virtues. Galv√£o made his profession of solemn vows on 16 April 1761, taking the additional vow to defend the Blessed Virgin Mary's title of the \\"Immaculate Conception\\", which was still a controversial doctrine at that time. On 11 July 1762, Galv√£o was ordained a priest and transferred to St. Francis Friary in the city of S√£o Paulo, where he continued his studies in theology and philosophy. In early 1766, around the completion of his studies, Anthony made a spiritual submission of himself as a \\"servant and slave\\" of the Blessed Mother, signing a document to this effect, dated 9 March, which he signed in his own blood.Official website In 1768 he was appointed preacher, confessor and porter of the friary, an important post. From 1769 to 1770 Galv√£o served as confessor to the Recollection of St. Teresa () in the city of S√£o Paulo, which was a hermitage of women Recollects (recluses living in common but not under religious vows), dedicated to St. Teresa of √Åvila. There, he met Sister Helena Maria of the Holy Spirit, a recluse who claimed to have had visions in which Jesus was asking her to found a new Recollect house. Galv√£o, her confessor, studied these messages and consulted with others who recognized them as valid and supernatural. Galv√£o collaborated in the foundation of the new Recollect house, named Our Lady of the Conception of Divine Providence, which was established on 2 February 1774 in the same city. It was modeled after the Conceptionist nuns, and became the home for girls who wished to live a religious life but without taking vows. With Sister Helena's sudden death on 23 February 1775, Galv√£o became the new superior of the community, serving as the Recollects' new spiritual leader. St. Anthony in Guaratinguet√°. Around that time, a change in S√£o Paulo's provincial government brought an inflexible leader who ordered the closing of the hermitage. Galv√£o accepted the decision, but the recluses refused to leave the premises, and due to popular pressure and the efforts of the Bishop of S√£o Paulo, the hermitage was soon re-opened. Subsequently, with the increasing number of new recluses, more living space was required. It took Galv√£o 28 years to build the hermitage and church, with the latter being inaugurated on 15 August 1802. In addition to the construction work and duties within and outside his Order, Galv√£o committed himself to the Recollect's formation. The Statutes he wrote for them was a guide for the interior life and religious discipline. When things seemed more quiet, another government intervention brought Galv√£o a further trial. The Captain General sentenced a soldier to death for having slightly offended his son, and the friar was sent into exile for coming to the soldier's defence. Again, popular demand succeeded in having the order revoked. In 1781, Galv√£o was appointed novice master in Cachoeiras de Macacu. However, the Recollects and the Bishop of S√£o Paulo appealed to the Minister Provincial, writing that \\"none of the inhabitants of this city will be able to bear the absence of this Religious for a single moment\\". As a result, he returned. He was later named Guardian of St. Francis Friary in S√£o Paulo in 1798, being re-appointed in 1801. In 1811 Galv√£o founded St. Clare Friary in Sorocaba. Eleven months later, he returned to S√£o Paulo. In his old age, he obtained permission from the bishop and the Guardian to stay at the Recollect house. He died there on 23 December 1822.

The New York Times. May 12, 2007. Galv√£o was the first saint canonized by Pope Benedict XVI in a ceremony held outside the Vatican City. His proclamation as a saint came after the Catholic Church accepted that two miracles had taken place. According to the Church, the cases of Sandra Grossi de Almeida and Daniella Cristina da Silva are miracles effected through the prayers of Galv√£o. After taking one of the paper pills, Almeida, who had a uterine malformation that should have made it impossible for her to carry a child for more than four months, gave birth to baby boy Enzo. Galv√£o's pills are also certified by the Church with the healing, in 1990, of Daniella Cristina da Silva, a four-year-old girl suffering from what doctors considered incurable hepatitis.AFP. \\"The miracle pills of Friar Galvao, Brazil's soon to be saint\\" .

He is also remembered for his statesmanship, in particular his accomplishments as a diplomat. Elected to the Philippine Senate from 1957 to 1963, he was the first Filipino film actor to parlay his fame into a substantial political career, paving the way for other future Filipino entertainers-turned-politicians such as Senators Eddie Ilarde, Ramon Revilla, Sr., Tito Sotto, Ramon \\"Bong\\" Revilla, Jr., Jinggoy Estrada, Lito Lapid, Freddie Webb, and President Joseph Estrada. Early life He was born in Lubao, Pampanga, the son of an arnis champion. Lubao was also the hometown of Diosdado Macapagal, six years his senior and a future political opponent and brother-in-law. Macapagal's first wife, Purita, was de la Rosa's sister. He has Spanish and Chinese ancestry. While in high school, de la Rosa, along with Macapagal would regularly perform in zarzuelas as a villain.\\"Filipinos in History Vol. 3\\", page 76.

Rosales proved to be his most durable onscreen partner, and their \\"love team\\" is said to be among the most successful in the history of Philippine movies. When the Philippine film industry was held to a standstill during the Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945, de la Rosa remained in the public eye as a bodabil performer at the Life Theater in Manila. After the war, he resumed his film career and proved more popular than ever. emerged as a star, perhaps the most popular film actor of the first decade of the post- war. He formed his own film production company, RDR Productions, and starred as well in productions of LVN Pictures, often with Rosales. By 1948, he was the highest paid Filipino movie actor.Garcia, J., \\"A Movie Quizbook, p. 110 His success in films remained steady in the 1950s. He had been cast as the first Filipino actor, under the name of Ramon Delgado, to star in an American- produced movie, The Sword of Avenger.

(1956, Jun 17). South China Sunday Post - Herald Senator and presidential candidate In the 1957 general elections, de la Rosa ran and won a seat in the Philippine Senate under the banner of the Liberal Party. He served for one 6-year term spanning the 4th and 5th Congress. As a Senator, he was active in issues of particular concern within his home province of Pampanga such as fisheries and agriculture, emerging as a strong advocate for nationalization of those industries. Appropriately, de la Rosa was also interested in issues relating to the Filipino film industry, co- authoring a bill that would lead to the establishment of a Board of Censors. After three years in the Senate, de la Rosa decided to run for the presidency as an independent candidate. His residual popularity as a film star, as well as the unpopularity of incumbent re-electionist Nacionalista Carlos P. Garcia made him a credible candidate. The other major candidate in the race was then- Vice President Macapagal of the Liberal Party, his former brother-in- law.Macapagal's first wife and de la Rosa's sister, Purita, died in 1942, and Macapagal remarried after the war. Shortly before election day, de la Rosa withdrew from the election. According to his official Senate biography, de la Rosa was concerned about the strength of what he perceived as the corrupt political machinery of President Garcia, and was ultimately convinced that his withdrawal from the race was the only way to ensure Garcia's defeat. Whatever the motivation, de la Rosa's gambit proved successful, and Macapagal was easily elected over Garcia. Returning to the Liberal Party, de la Rosa was defeated for re-election to the Senate in the 1963 general elections. He would never again be elected to public office. Diplomat and later years De la Rosa remained in public service as an acclaimed diplomat. In 1965, he was appointed Philippine Ambassador to Cambodia, an important designation considering that country's proximity to the Philippines.\\"Filipinos in History Vol. 3\\", page 77. During the administration of Ferdinand Marcos, de la Rosa was also named as Philippine Ambassador to the Netherlands, and to the Soviet bloc countries of Poland, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. He was duly admired for his savvy in foreign affairs and language proficiency. He also used his position to promote Filipino art and culture and to assist Filipino artists performing abroad. His last diplomatic post was Philippine Ambassador to Sri Lanka. He was well loved by the Filipino community there and reciprocated by serving his utmost best. After retiring from the diplomatic corps, De la Rosa made his last foray into politics by unsuccessfully running in the 1984 Batasang Pambansa parliamentary election.

Holmes was born in Oakes, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England. An opening batsman and a fine fielder, Holmes was a late developer who played only a handful of matches for Yorkshire before World War I, but came to immediate prominence after it with 1,886 runs and five centuries in 1919. He was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1920. With Herbert Sutcliffe, Holmes formed for fifteen seasons the most prolific opening partnership in first-class cricket, and 69 times they put on 100 runs or more for the first wicket. Their partnership culminated, in 1932 against Essex at Leyton, in a then-world-record stand of 555, beating the previous Yorkshire (and world) record by Brown and Tunnicliffe in 1898 by just one run. Holmes contributed an unbeaten 224 to the partnership, which remained the world-record first-wicket partnership for 44 years. It is still the highest partnership for any wicket in English domestic cricket, and the fifth- highest ever for any wicket in the world. According to Neville Cardus, Holmes was a jaunty, restless character who believed cricket should be fun. He tended to score quickly and to play shots, such as cuts and pulls, that \\"more correct\\" batsmen such as Sutcliffe rarely used. International career Holmes' Test cricket career was limited to just seven matches, largely because Jack Hobbs was a fixture in the England team until Holmes was past forty years of age. He was picked and discarded, like many others, as England chopped and changed its eleven in 1921 in a vain attempt to match the Australian cricket team under Warwick Armstrong; in fact, Holmes was top scorer, with thirty out of 112, in the first innings of the first Test at Trent Bridge, but he scored only eight in the second innings, and the match was over inside two days. He had to wait six years before being picked again, for the 1927‚Äì28 tour to South Africa under Rony Stanyforth, where he opened with Sutcliffe in all five Tests, making 302 runs, including four scores of more than fifty and a highest of 88, but finishing with a \\"pair\\" in the last Test. His seventh and final Test came ten days after his world record stand, when, at forty-five, he was picked for the Lord's match against India in 1932. He made just 6 and 11. County career Holmes (left) with Sutcliffe at Leyton on 16 June 1932 when they put on 555 for the first wicket, Holmes scoring 224 not out. In county cricket, Holmes was reliably prolific. He scored more than 2,000 runs in seven seasons between 1920 and 1930, and more than 1,500 runs in six other seasons. He scored 1,021 runs in the month of June in 1925 at an average of 102, a sequence that included his highest score, 315 not out, at Lord's against Middlesex, at that point the highest score ever made on the ground. In all first-class cricket, he scored 30,573 runs at an average of more than 42 per innings, with 67 centuries: he is 58th on the all-time list of run-getters. His career with Yorkshire dissolved under a cloud, however, when the Yorkshire Committee, worried about his 46 years and increasing troubles with lumbago, resolved against renewing his contract. A brouhaha was quickly enkindled by the furious Yorkshire members, who put forward a vote of no confidence in the Committee, contending that this was no way to treat so true-hearted and prolific a servant of Yorkshire cricket, but the decision stood.

The glacier is located on the east and north slopes of Gannett Peak, the highest mountain in Wyoming, on the east side of the Continental Divide in the Wind River Range. Gannett is but one of dozens of glaciers located in the Fitzpatrick Wilderness of Shoshone National Forest. As is true with many glaciers around the world, Gannett Glacier is slowly disappearing. Photographic evidence clearly demonstrates that there has been an enormous reduction in the area of the glacier since the 1920s. The area of the glacier was estimated in 1950 to be and was measured in 1999 to be . Measurements taken in 1958 and again in 1983 showed a depth reduction of over 25 years. A general warming pattern and a reduction in moisture is widely believed to be the reason for the glacier retreating. Numerous other glaciers are located in the immediate area including six more that are within the top ten in size within the Rocky Mountains of the U.S. In a 1989 study, both Gannett and Dinwoody glaciers were researched to determine the amount of melt water they supplied to streams. Both glaciers supply melt water which flows into Dinwoody Creek, which in turn flows into the Wind River. The melt water was found to have contributed increasingly lower amounts to the total water supplied to Dinwoody Creek. This has been attributed to the glaciers thinning and retreating, especially since 1950, when Gannett Glacier was measured to be almost 20 percent larger than in 1999. The impact on reduced stream flow from Gannett Glacier due to glacial retreat affects more than just the amount of water available for the local ecosystem and downstream agricultural and ranching interests.

Representation of persons who must be represented and persons who need not be represented but want to be represented must be by a professional representative, or, if the party is a \\"European party\\", the representation may be by an authorised employee or by a legal practitioner.. A legal practitioner representing a party before the EPO must be qualified in an EPC Contracting State, must have his place of business in that State, and must be entitled in that State to act as a professional representative in patent matters. Both authorised employees and legal practitioners \\"must file a signed authorisation or a reference to a general authorisation already on file\\".Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, p.128: Decision of the President of the European Patent Office dated 12 July 2007 on the filing of authorisations, Articles 2 and 3. Subject to these rules, a party has the right to be represented in the manner he chose.See for instance Decision of the Technical Board of Appeal 3.5.02 of 9 November 2011, Reasons for the Decision 2.3, penultimate sentence.  Professional representatives  Professional representatives bear the title of European patent attorney. In order to be a European patent attorney, one must: * be a national of one of the EPC Contracting States (the President of the EPO may grant exemptions \\"in special circumstances\\"); and * have a place of business in one of the EPC Contracting States; and * have passed the European qualifying examination (EQE); or Formerly being a qualified or experienced patent attorney at the entry into force of the EPC in their state provided exemption from passing the EQEs (known as the \\"grandfather clause\\"). In December 1998, the ratio of registrations under the grandfather clause to those having passed the EQE was two to one.D. Visser, The Annotated European Patent Convention 2000, 15th Edition, (Veldhoven, The Netherlands, 2007), p. 321. On 29 November 2000, this clause was removed from the EPC.EPC Transitional Provisions In order to sit the EQE, candidates should notably show that \\"they possess a university-level scientific or technical qualification.\\" (Article 11(1)(a) REE) An equivalent level of scientific or technical knowledge obtained through at least ten years' experience is also considered sufficient.Article 11(1)(a) REE and Rule 14 IPREE  Pre- examination  Starting 2012, after 2 years of related work experience, candidates can write the pre-examination, which is a 4-hour multiple choice exam held once a year. The pre-examination assesses candidates' ability to answer legal questions and questions relating to the drafting of claims (IPREE, Rule 10). A passing grade of 70 marks out of 100 must be achieved to be permitted to write the main exam (EQE) one year later (IPREE, Rule 6).  European qualifying examination  The main European qualifying examination (EQE) is a three-day pen-and-paper examination, comprising four papers. Due to the introduction of the pre-examination in 2012, starting 2013, three papers of the main exam are shorter than their previous formats so that the EQE now consists of the following papers: * Paper A (4 hours) consists in drafting claims and the introduction (field of the invention, prior art, problem to be solved and its solution) of a European patent application, on the basis of the fictitious letter by a client describing an invention and the related prior art.European qualifying examination, Guide for preparation, 3rd edition (September 2013), p. 13. * Paper B (3¬Ω hours) consists in preparing a reply to an official communication of an Examining Division raising substantive objections to a patent application, such novelty and inventive step objections. The reply is to be prepared based on fictitious instructions from a client. The problem-and-solution approach must typically be used.European qualifying examination, Guide for preparation, 3rd edition (September 2013), p. 13-14. * Paper C (5¬Ω hours) consists in drafting a notice of opposition to a European patent. The exercise is based on a fictitious letter from a client, a European patent to be opposed, several documents and an EPO opposition form. For paper C also, the problem-and-solution approach must typically be used for the inventive step assessment(s).European qualifying examination, Guide for preparation, 3rd edition (September 2013), p. 14. * Paper D (5¬Ω hours) consists in a series of legal questions on the EPC and the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT); and a legal case usually requiring analyzing the legal situation of a client and proposing actions to be undertaken to cope with the situation.European qualifying examination, Guide for preparation, 3rd edition (September 2013), p. 15. The European qualifying examination is held once a year, usually at the end of February or beginning of March,European qualifying examination, Guide for preparation, 3rd edition (September 2013), p. 10. simultaneously in various cities throughout Europe.European qualifying examination, Guide for preparation, 3rd edition (September 2013), p. 11. In 2013 for instance, it was held in Berlin, Bern, Bristol, Helsinki, Madrid, Munich, Paris, Rome, Stockholm, Taastrup and The Hague. Dictionaries and reference material can be used during the examination \\"as long as they are in paper form\\". The use of electronic devices is however not permitted. The marking of the Paper C of the EQE 2007, including awarding no point when candidates failed to select the \\"right\\" starting document (for assessing the inventive step of some claims) and the blanket addition of 10 points to the grade of all C papers, was strongly criticized.S.

Association of representatives Under , an association of professional representatives may be formed to collectively represent a party or parties before the EPO. In such a case, the authorisation of an association of representatives is deemed to apply to any representative who practises within the association. The Legal Division of the EPO is in charge of the registration of associations.Notice from the European Patent Office dated 28 August 2013 on matters concerning representation before the EPO, Official Journal EPO 11/2013, p. 535 The registration is free of charge.

If he does not, he shall be requested to do so within a period to be specified by the European Patent Office.\\"\\" The legal consequence of not filing an authorisation when requested to do so is that the procedural steps taken by the new representative are deemed not to have been taken.; see also Board of decision T 0267/08 of 29 November 2010, Reasons for the Decision 8.

It is located approximately from Perth's central business district on the Albany Highway and approximately from Cannington railway station. Following a redevelopment in 2018, Westfield Carousel became the largest shopping centre in Western Australia. History Westfield Carousel Shopping Centre was built in 1972 and originally contained 580 shops, a hotel, three takeaway food shops, a KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) Coles supermarket, and Boans (later acquired by Myer), Aherns (later acquired by David Jones) and Walsh's department stores. In 1973, a freestanding Target store opened. In 1979, an extension included connection of the existing centre to the Target, Coles and new speciality stores. The original centre incorporated the site of Boans Waverley, the first suburban Boans branch, which opened in 1959. It also later incorporated the Waverley Hotel, which stood on the corner of Albany Highway and Cecil Road (now Cecil Avenue). It was purchased by the Westfield Group in 1996.Premier opens $355 million Westfield Carousel Westfield Group 1987 to 1990 In the late 1980s, Boans was taken over by Myer, becoming the chain's third department store in Western Australia. The Aherns store was also replaced with Myer in the 1980s. With two Myer locations in the shopping centre, one was used for fashion (the former Boans near Albany Hwy) and one for homeware and furniture (the former Aherns). Reconfiguration of tenancies occurred in 1987, and Walshes was replaced by Treasureway. In 1990, Hoyts 8 Cinema was opened as a freestanding building near Carousel Road. This was one of the first suburban cinemas in Perth. 1998 to 1999 In 1998, a $200 million redevelopment and expansion began to double the size of the complex, which made it Western Australia's biggest shopping centre. This development included a Kmart Australia, Coles Supermarket, Rebel Sport, Lincraft, Harris Scarfe, Red Dot Stores, relocated Woolworths, consolidated Myer store, new Hoyts Cinema and the Al Fresco dining area with four dining retailers, a new food court and over 100 new retailers. Some mini-major stores were added to the older parts of the complex, such as Red Dot Stores and Best & Less. The complete centre underwent refurbishment throughout 1999. 2000s Entrance to Westfield Carousel in 2005 Further minor redevelopment occurred in the 2000s. Harris Scarfe closed in 2001 and was replaced with a larger Red Dot, Chain Reaction, Retravision and Drummond Golf. This portion of the centre was further reconfigured in 2008, following the departure of Lincraft, Red Dot and Chain Reaction. The minor redevelopment included a new mall with JB Hi-Fi, Kathmandu, The Reject Shop, Good Life Health Clubs and a number of banks and restaurants. 2010s Main atrium of Westfield Carousel, near Hoyts Cinemas and Coles In 2015, Rebel Sport was refurbished. Later that year, an iPlay arcade opened next to the cinema. In June 2016, Red Dot Stores opened near Best & Less. The food court, amenities and car park were also upgraded and opened late 2016. In early 2017, construction commenced on a $350 million redevelopment of Westfield Carousel. The introduction of David Jones is planned to anchor a new fashion mall that will be home to more than 60 new stores, a multi-deck carpark, an open-air lifestyle and leisure precinct, a fully refurbished 14-screen Hoyts cinema and 12 new restaurants.

Its origin is from the Latin pertusum meaning an opening in the mountain.

Institut d‚ÄôEstudis Catalans, Universit√© de Perpignan, Nomencl√†tor topon√≠mic de la Catalunya del Nord, Barcelone, 2007 History In the early 14th century, Le Perthus was a property of the counts of Roussillon and Emp√∫ries. Following the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, the town represented the border with Spain. Le Perthus first became a commune on 1 February 1837, by uniting the communes of Les Cluses and L'Alb√®re. But because of too many protests from the people of those communes, they were separated on 29 November 1837. It was then decided many years later to make Le Perthus a commune in itself again. This time, small parts of territory only were taken from Les Cluses and L'Alb√®re, and the village of Le Perthus once again became a commune on 29 April 1851. Municipal elections had already been organised in 1848 and quickly cancelled as it appeared that the mayor and the deputy-mayor had too many family ties with several of the municipal councillors, which is forbidden by French law.  Population  Population 1962-2008 Economy Le Perthus is a border town, partly in Spain and partly in France, situated on the Route Nationale RN9. The frontier passes through part of the main street. The Spanish part is almost entirely devoted to the sale of alcohol, tobacco and other goods which are considerably cheaper than in France, resulting in the town being crowded with bargain hunters from France.

It was first released in 2004 as volume 8 in the series. Although this book is number 8 in the series, it was released after number 9, L'acc√©l√©rateur atomique, which was released in 2003, and is thus the final entry in the series. The tone is practically void of humour and is even grim, creating a major contrast with the other, generally much lighter- spirited volumes. The themes of La vie comme elle vient are death, loss, and how people deal with them. At around the same time the book was published, Trondheim announced his decision to more or less retire and only publish new comic strips on an occasional basis. However after a break he would eventually continue to produce new books regularly. Plot This adventure takes place in modern France and uses the normal continuing storyline of the series. Lapinot meets with all his friends for a party in the apartment he shares with his girlfriend Nadia. There, a tarot card reader predicts someone in the room will die before the next day. Lapinot and Nadia break up and pretty much all the other characters suffer various misfortunes: for example, Richard is beaten up and falls into a coma, and Titi is diagnosed with cancer. It turns out to be Lapinot, the main character of the series, who dies as the story finishes. After the book's publication, Trondheim explained in his book D√©soeuvr√© that the death of his character didn't exclude the possibility of seeing him again in stock historical settings or in modern day flashbacks before his death. In August 2017, however, the graphic novel \\"Un monde un peu meilleur\\" brings back Lapinot in his established continuity, with the only difference being that he didn't die.

It is definitely Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's best work till today. It has very unique sounds, and Sameer's lyrics are also fabulous. It is not the type which will become obsolete after a point of time. You will want to pull out its CD even after 15 years and listen to the music.\\" Anil Kapoor, who plays Vinay, too echoed the same sentiments, saying the album was best to come out of Bollywood in a long time.  Reception  The album was met with highly positive reviews from music critics and was a huge commercial success. Sukanya Verma of Rediff in her 4.5 star review, remarked, \\"Salaam-e-Ishq is a well-designed, wholesome soundtrack with emphasis on melody, beat and innovation.

It was formed under the Police Act 1964, and was a merger of the previous West Riding Constabulary along with six borough forces for the county boroughs of Barnsley, Dewsbury, Doncaster, Halifax, Huddersfield, Wakefield. The other four West Riding county boroughs, Bradford, Leeds, Sheffield and Rotherham, retained independent police forces (a merged force for Sheffield/Rotherham). The West Riding Constabulary had been originally set up in 1856, as required by the County and Borough Police Act 1856. The first Chief Constable was Lt Col C. A. Cobbe. The force's strength was 354 by the end of the year, and its headquarters were at Wakefield. In 1974 the force was split, under the Local Government Act 1972. The bulk of the force went to form the new West Yorkshire Police (with Bradford and Leeds) and South Yorkshire Police (with Sheffield and Rotherham Constabulary the former Barnsley and Doncaster County Borough forces and the interlinked county areas), with other parts coming under the North Yorkshire Police, Cumbria Constabulary, Humberside Police, and Lancashire Police forces.

Life Kaplan was born in Rahachow, Belarus (in Russian, Rogachov) one of six children; his father was a butcher in Rahachow which was at that time within the Jewish Pale of Settlement in Russia. His background was therefore not dissimilar to that of Marc Chagall, born a generation earlier in 1887, and although their lives were very different, their art has much in common. The shtetl (Jewish village) figures in many of Kaplan's paintings; autobiographical references are very clear in The Butcher's Shop (1972) and Tailor's Shops (1975) and in the many illustrations which he was to create to the works of Sholem Aleichem. Around 1922 Kaplan came to Leningrad (then named Petrograd), where he was to base his career for the rest of his life, although he often revisited the towns of his childhood. He graduated in 1927 from the Russian Academy of Arts there. In the 1930s he became associated with a group of artists and lithographers in Leningrad which had been instructed to prepare a series of works dedicated to the remote Jewish Autonomous Oblast, being created by Joseph Stalin in the hope of resettling Russia's Jewish population in a remote area in the Far East of the country. Here Kaplan learnt and took to the skills of printmaking, developing many individual techniques. His first cycle of prints (1937‚Äì1940) was entitled Kasrilevka, (the name of the village invented by Sholem Aleichem). During the war Kaplan was at first evacuated to the Urals, but returned to Leningrad in 1944. His lithograph cycle of Landscapes of Leningrad during the Days of the Blockade (1948) was widely acclaimed in Russia and was purchased by eighteen State galleries. At one time Kaplan was supervisor of design in a glassware factory and this gave him an interest in the third dimension which was later to blossom in his ceramics and sculptures. From the 1950s onwards Kaplan's artworks concentrated on Jewish themes, despite constant and often serious opposition and obstruction from the Soviet cultural authorities.Kiplitsky (1995), ii pp. 8-10. Amongst these works are his cover and illustrations to the Jewish Folksongs of Dmitri Shostakovich (1977), illustrations to Aleichem's Tevye the Milkman (3 series, 1957‚Äì1966), The Enchanted Tailor (1954‚Äì57) and Song of Songs (1962), and an extensive series of coloured lithographs (printed in London in 1961) on the old Jewish Passover song Chad Gadya (One Kid Goat). Throughout this time Kaplan was also producing paintings, though because of their subject matter they were rarely displayed in the Russia of his time. From 1967 onward he began also to produce ceramics and sculptures, including a set based on the characters of Gogol's Dead Souls. Kaplan died in Leningrad, aged 77. Exhibitions A substantial retrospective exhibition of Kaplan's work was held at the Russian Museum, St. Petersburg, in 1995. Other major exhibitions have been held in New York City (1992), London, Amsterdam, Jerusalem and elsewhere. NotesReferences * Kiblitsky, Joseph (ed.), 1995.

A convex cone (light blue). Inside of it, the light red convex cone consists of all points Œ±x + Œ≤y with Œ±, Œ≤ > 0, for the depicted x and y. The curves on the upper right symbolize that the regions are infinite in extent.  Definition  A subset C of a vector space V is a cone (or sometimes called a linear cone) if for each x in C and positive scalars Œ±, the product Œ±x is in C. Note that some authors define cone with the scalar Œ± ranging over all non-negative reals (rather than all positive reals, which does not include 0). A cone C is a convex cone if belongs to C, for any positive scalars Œ±, Œ≤, and any x, y in C. A cone C is convex if and only if C + C ‚äÜ C. This concept is meaningful for any vector space that allows the concept of \\"positive\\" scalar, such as spaces over the rational, algebraic, or (more commonly) the real numbers. Also note that the scalars in the definition are positive meaning that the origin does not have to belong to C. Some authors use a definition that ensures the origin belongs to C. Because of the scaling parameters Œ± and Œ≤, cones are infinite in extent and not bounded. If C is a convex cone, then for any positive scalar Œ± and any x in C the vector \\\\alpha x = \\\\tfrac{\\\\alpha}{2}x + \\\\tfrac{\\\\alpha}{2}x \\\\in C. It follows that a convex cone C is a special case of a linear cone. It follows from the above property that a convex cone can also be defined as a linear cone that is closed under convex combinations, or just under additions. More succinctly, a set C is a convex cone if and only if and , for any positive scalar Œ±.  Examples  Convex cone that is not a conic combination of finitely many generators. Convex cone generated by the conic combination of the three black vectors. A cone (the union of two rays) that is not a convex cone. * For a vector space V, the empty set, the space V, and any linear subspace of V are convex cones. * The conical combination of a finite or infinite set of vectors in \\\\R^n is a convex cone. * The tangent cones of a convex set are convex cones. * The set ::\\\\left { x \\\\in \\\\R^2 \\\\mid x_2 \\\\geq 0, x_1 = 0 \\\\right } \\\\cup \\\\left { x \\\\in \\\\R^2 \\\\mid x_1 \\\\geq 0, x_2 = 0 \\\\right } :is a cone but not a convex cone. * The norm cone ::\\\\left { (x, r) \\\\in \\\\R^{d+1} \\\\mid \\\\x\\\\ \\\\leq r \\\\right } :is a convex cone. * The intersection of two convex cones in the same vector space is again a convex cone, but their union may fail to be one. * The class of convex cones is also closed under arbitrary linear maps. In particular, if C is a convex cone, so is its opposite -C and C \\\\cap -C is the largest linear subspace contained in C. * The set of positive semidefinite matrices. * The set of nonnegative continuous functions is a convex cone.  Special Examples = Affine convex cones  An affine convex cone is the set resulting from applying an affine transformation to a convex cone. A common example is translating a convex cone by a point p: p+C. Technically, such transformations can produce non-cones. For example, unless p=0, p+C is not a linear cone. However, it is still called an affine convex cone.  Half-spaces  A (linear) hyperplane is a set in the form { x \\\\in V \\\\mid f(x) = c} where f is a linear functional on the vector space V. A closed half-space is a set in the form { x \\\\in V \\\\mid f(x) \\\\leq c} or { x \\\\in V \\\\mid f(x) \\\\geq c}, and likewise an open half-space uses strict inequality. Half-spaces (open or closed) are affine convex cones. Moreover (in finite dimensions), any convex cone C that is not the whole space V must be contained in some closed half-space H of V; this is a special case of Farkas' lemma.  Polyhedral and finitely generated cones  Polyhedral cones are special kinds of cones that can be defined in several ways: * A cone C is polyhedral if it is the conic combination of finitely many vectors (this property is also called finitely-generated). I.e., there is a set of vectors {v_1, \\\\ldots, v_k} so that C = { a_1 v_1 + \\\\cdots + a_kv_k \\\\mid a_i \\\\in \\\\R_{\\\\ge 0}, v_i \\\\in \\\\R^n }. * A cone is polyhedral if it is the intersection of a finite number of half-spaces which have 0 on their boundary (this was proved by Weyl at 1935). * A cone C is polyhedral if there is some matrix A such that C = {x \\\\in \\\\R^n \\\\mid Ax \\\\geq 0 }. * A cone is polyhedral if it is the solution set of a system of homogeneous linear inequalities. Algebraically, each inequality is defined by a row of the matrix A. Geometrically, each inequality defines a halfspace that passes through the origin. Every finitely generated cone is a polyhedral cone, and every polyhedral cone is a finitely generated cone. Every polyhedral cone has a unique representation as a conical hull of its extremal generators, and a unique representation of intersections of halfspaces, given each linear form associated with the halfspaces also define a support hyperplane of a facet. Polyhedral cones play a central role in the representation theory of polyhedra. For instance, the decomposition theorem for polyhedra states that every polyhedron can be written as the Minkowski sum of a convex polytope and a polyhedral cone. Polyhedral cones also play an important part in proving the related Finite Basis Theorem for polytopes which shows that every polytope is a polyhedron and every bounded polyhedron is a polytope. The two representations of a polyhedral cone - by inequalities and by vectors - may have very different sizes. For example, consider the cone of all non-negative n-by-n matrices with equal row and column sums. The inequality representation requires n2 inequalities and 2(n-1) equations, but the vector representation requires n! vectors (see the Birkhoff-von Neumann Theorem). The opposite can also happen - the number of vectors may be polynomial while the number of inequalities is exponential. The two representations together provide an efficient way to decide whether a given vector is in the cone: to show that it is in the cone, it is sufficient to present it is a conic combination of the defining vectors; to show that it is not in the cone, it is sufficient to present a single defining inequality that it violates. This fact is known as Farkas' lemma. A subtle point in the representation by vectors is that the number of vectors may be exponential in the dimension, so the proof that a vector is in the cone might be exponentially long. Fortunately, Carath√©odory's theorem guarantees that every vector in the cone can be represented by at most d defining vectors, where d is the dimension of the space.  Blunt, pointed, flat, salient, and proper cones  According to the above definition, if C is a convex cone, then C ‚à™ {0} is a convex cone, too. A convex cone is said to be ' if 0 is in C, and ' if 0 is not in C. Blunt cones can be excluded from the definition of convex cone by substituting \\"non-negative\\" for \\"positive\\" in the condition of Œ±, Œ≤. A cone is called flat if it contains some nonzero vector x and its opposite -x, meaning C contains a linear subspace of dimension at least one, and salient otherwise. A blunt convex cone is necessarily salient, but the converse is not necessarily true. A convex cone C is salient if and only if C ‚à© ‚àíC ‚äÜ {0}. A cone C is said to be generating if C ‚àí C is equal to the whole vector space. Some authors require salient cones to be pointed. The term \\"pointed\\" is also often used to refer to a closed cone that contains no complete line (i.e., no nontrivial subspace of the ambient vector space V, or what is called a salient cone). The term proper (convex) cone is variously defined, depending on the context and author. It often means a cone that satisfies other properties like being convex, closed, pointed, salient, and full-dimensional. Because of these varying definitions, the context or source should be consulted for the definition of these terms.  Rational Cones  A type of cone of particular interest to pure mathematicians is the partially ordered set of rational cones. \\"Rational cones are important objects in toric algebraic geometry, combinatorial commutative algebra, geometric combinatorics, integer programming.\\" . This object arises when we study cones in \\\\R^d together with the lattice \\\\Z^d. A cone is called rational (here we assume \\"pointed\\", as defined above) whenever its generators all have integer coordinates, i.e., if C is a rational cone, then C = { a_1 v_1 + \\\\cdots + a_k v_k \\\\mid a_i \\\\in \\\\R_+, v_i \\\\in \\\\Z^d } . Dual cone Let C ‚äÇ V be a set, not necessary a convex set, in a real vector space V equipped with an inner product. The (continuous or topological) dual cone to C is the set : C^* = { v\\\\in V \\\\mid \\\\forall w\\\\in C, \\\\langle w,v \\\\rangle \\\\ge 0 }, which is always a convex cone. More generally, the (algebraic) dual cone to C ‚äÇ V in a linear space V is a subset of the dual space V* defined by: : C^* := \\\\left { v\\\\in V^* \\\\mid \\\\forall w\\\\in C, v(w) \\\\ge 0 \\\\right }. In other words, if V* is the algebraic dual space of V, it is the set of linear functionals that are nonnegative on the primal cone C. If we take V* to be the continuous dual space then it is the set of continuous linear functionals nonnegative on C. This notion does not require the specification of an inner product on V. In finite dimensions, the two notions of dual cone are essentially the same because every finite dimensional linear functional is continuous, and every continuous linear functional in a inner product space induces a linear isomorphism (nonsingular linear map) from V* to V, and this isomorphism will take the dual cone given by the second definition, in V*, onto the one given by the first definition; see the Riesz representation theorem. If C is equal to its dual cone, then C is called self-dual. A cone can be said to be self- dual without reference to any given inner product, if there exists an inner product with respect to which it is equal to its dual by the first definition.  Constructions  * Given a closed, convex subset K of Hilbert space V, the outward normal cone to the set K at the point x in K is given by :N_K(x) = \\\\left { p \\\\in V\\\\;:\\\\;\\\\forall x^* \\\\in K, \\\\langle p, x^* - x \\\\rangle \\\\leq 0 \\\\right }. * Given a closed, convex subset K of V, the tangent cone (or contingent cone) to the set K at the point x is given by :T_K(x) = \\\\overline{\\\\bigcup_{h>0} \\\\tfrac{1}{h} (K-x)}. * Given a closed, convex subset K of Hilbert space V, the tangent cone to the set K at the point x in K can be defined as polar cone to outwards normal cone N_K(x): :T_K(x) = N_K^*(x)\\\\overset{\\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{def}}{}}{=}{y\\\\in V\\\\forall \\\\xi\\\\in N_K(x): \\\\langle y, \\\\xi \\\\rangle \\\\leqslant 0 } Both the normal and tangent cone have the property of being closed and convex. They are important concepts in the fields of convex optimization, variational inequalities and projected dynamical systems.  Properties  If C is a non-empty convex cone in X, then the linear span of C is equal to C - C and the largest vector subspace of X contained in C is equal to C ‚à© (-C). Partial order defined by a convex cone A pointed and salient convex cone C induces a partial ordering \\"‚â§\\" on V, defined so that x\\\\leq y if and only if y-x\\\\in C. (If the cone is flat, the same definition gives merely a preorder.) Sums and positive scalar multiples of valid inequalities with respect to this order remain valid inequalities. A vector space with such an order is called an ordered vector space. Examples include the product order on real-valued vectors, \\\\R^n, and the Loewner order on positive semidefinite matrices. Such an ordering is commonly found in positive semidefinite programming.

EUC is a group of approaches to computing that aim to better integrate end users into the computing environment. These approaches attempt to realize the potential for high-end computing to perform problem- solving in a trustworthy manner.McBride, Neil, \\"Towards User-Oriented control of End-User Computing in Large Organizations\\"Mahmood, Adam, Advances in End User Computing Series University of Texas, USA, End-user computing can range in complexity from users simply clicking a series of buttons, to writing scripts in a controlled scripting language, to being able to modify and execute code directly. Examples of end-user computing are systems built using fourth-generation programming languages, such as MAPPER or SQL, or one of the fifth-generation programming languages, such as ICAD. Factors Factors contributing to the need for further EUC research include knowledge processing, pervasive computing, issues of ontology, interactive visualization, and the like. Some of the issues related to end-user computing concern software architecture (iconic versus language interfaces, open versus closed, and others). Other issues relate to intellectual property, configuration and maintenance. End-user computing allows more user-input into system affairs that can range from personalization to full-fledged ownership of a system. EUC strategy EUC applications should not be evolved by accident, but there should be a defined EUC strategy. Any Application Architecture Strategy / IT Strategy should consider the white spaces in automation (enterprise functionality not automated by ERP / Enterprise Grade Applications). These are the potential areas where EUC can play a major role. Then ASSIMPLER parameters should be applied to these white spaces to develop the EUC strategy. (ASSIMPLER stands for availability, scalability, security, interoperability, maintainability, performance, low cost of ownership, extendibility and reliability. Compare: ) In businesses, an end-user concept gives workers more flexibility, as well as more opportunities for better productivity and creativity. However, EUC will work only when leveraged correctly. That‚Äôs why it requires a full-fledged strategy. Business owners should understand that every user-controlled app should be monitored and supervised.

History The concert was produced by Shelly Finkel and Jim Koplik, two promoters who previously organized a successful Grateful Dead concert at Dillon Stadium, Hartford, Connecticut, in 1972. At the Dillon Stadium concert, the Grateful Dead were joined on-stage by Dickey Betts, Berry Oakley, and Jai Johanny Johanson, members of The Allman Brothers Band. This impromptu jam planted the seeds that would eventually spawn the \\"Summer Jam\\" concert in Watkins Glen, NY. Similar to the 1969 Woodstock Festival, an enormous traffic jam created chaos for those who attempted to make it to the concert site. Long and narrow country roads forced fans to abandon their vehicles and walk 5‚Äì8 miles on that hot summer day. 150,000 tickets were sold for $10 each, but for all the other people it was a free concert. The crowd was so huge that most of the audience were not able to see the stage. However the sound from the stage speakers was augmented 200 feet from the stage by four delay towers, towers with speakers wired to the stage amps but with a 0.175 second delay provided by Eventide digital delay units, so that by the time the sound from the stage speakers reached the tower area through the air, the sound from the delay towers was synchronized with the stage sound. There were six more delay towers arranged radially 200 feet further from those towers - 400 feet from the stage - and six more towers 200 feet further out. Sixteen delay towers in all, plus the main PA. They were driven by about 24,000 watts of power. Although the concert was scheduled to start on July 28, thousands of music fans were already at the concert site on the 27th. Robbie Robertson of The Band requested to do a soundcheck, but was perplexed that so many people were sitting in front of the stage. Bill Graham allowed the soundcheck with the crowd of people in front, and The Band ran through a few numbers to the delight of the audience. The Allman Brothers Band did their soundcheck next, playing \\"One Way Out\\" and \\"Ramblin' Man\\". The Grateful Dead's legendary soundcheck turned into a two set marathon, featuring their familiar tunes such as \\"Sugaree\\", \\"Tennessee Jed\\" and \\"Wharf Rat\\". They also performed a unique jam that was eventually included on their retrospective CD box set So Many Roads (1965-1995). On July 28, the day of the concert, 600,000 music fans had arrived in Watkins Glen. Grateful Dead performed first, playing two long sets. They opened with \\"Bertha\\" and played many hits such as \\"Box Of Rain\\", \\"Jack Straw\\", \\"Playing in the Band\\", \\"China Cat Sunflower\\" and \\"Eyes of the World\\". The Band followed the Dead with one two-hour set. However, their set was cut in half by a drenching thunderstorm, in a scene again reminiscent of Woodstock, people were covered with mud. During the storm, keyboardist Garth Hudson performed his signature organ improvisation \\"The Genetic Method\\"; when the rain finally let up, the full Band joined Hudson on stage, and segued into their signature song \\"Chest Fever\\", in a manner similar to how the songs were presented on The Band's live album Rock of Ages. Finally, the Allman Brothers Band performed for three hours. Their performance included songs from their soon-to-be-released album Brothers and Sisters, along with their standards \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\", \\"Statesboro Blues\\", \\"Les Brers in A Minor\\" and \\"Whipping Post\\". Following the Allmans' second set, there was an hour encore jam featuring musicians from all three bands. The jam featured spirited renditions of \\"Not Fade Away\\", \\"Mountain Jam\\", and \\"Johnny B. Goode\\". Although there were no reports of violence at Watkins Glen, the day was marred by the death of Willard Smith, 35, a skydiver from Syracuse, New York. Smith dived from an airplane carrying flares. One of the flares ignited his body suit, and he was engulfed in flames. Smith's body was eventually found in the woods near the concert site. There is also the unsolved disappearance of two high school teenagers (Mitchel Weiser and Bonnie Bickwit) from Brooklyn who were hitchhiking to the concert. Summer Jam was the last concert event to be held at Watkins Glen International until 2011, when the rock band Phish organized and performed at a three day festival, called Super Ball IX, at the complex. In 2013, a maintenance crew from Watkins Glen International found abandoned cars from the event in the woods on track property. Pirate radio CFR Studio at Watkins Glen A pirate radio station out of Hartford, Connecticut operated for seven days from the site of the concert. Broadcasting as CFR AM and CFR FM, they pulled a camper with a fully equipped radio studio into the concert's press area five days before the gates opened and were accepted by the other media as a Canadian radio station setting up to do a remote broadcast of the concert. Broadcasting commenced almost immediately after arrival at the site and consisted of live disc jockeys (10 people were involved with the pirate station, including several prominent Hartford DJs at the time). As opening day approached, station personnel interviewed Bill Graham, Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead and various musicians as the studio/camper was set up along the access road between the heliport and the stage. Adjacent to the press area were a detachment of New York Mounted Police who appeared to be thrilled to have a station broadcasting from the site. In exchange for free food, the radio station relayed New York State Police announcements about traffic congestion every thirty minutes. Due to Watkins Glen Race track being on a hill, the station's AM and FM signals traveled several dozen miles. The station interrupted its regular programming to carry the last two days of the concert live and continued to broadcast for four days after the show ended to provide information and entertainment to the departing crowd.

A 10-song excerpt from their set.[ Allmusic review] Although this album was purported to be \\"Live at Watkins Glen,\\" it was revealed to be a fraud in the liner notes of the remastered Moondog Matinee CD released in 2001 by Capitol. The following quote is from the liner notes, \\"Chuck Berry's Going Back To Memphis, on the other hand, was completed and ready for inclusion on the album Moondog Matinee but ended up being shelved in favor of Promised Land. This version has been released before complete with overdubbed audience sounds as the opening track on the fraudulent Live at Watkins Glen CD. No one in The Band was connected with that particular release which had been originally mastered sometime in the late 1970s or early 1980s, although not released until 1995.

Earlier versions were exclusive to Peugeot and Citro√´n. In 1998, PSA entered into a joint venture with the Ford Motor Company to produce a range of new diesel engines. The joint venture makes identical engines which are fitted to a variety of vehicles from a range of car manufacturers. The engines are assembled in production plants in the cities of Tr√©mery and Douvrin for PSA in France, at the Ford Dagenham plant in the UK, and Volvo Engine Plant in Sk√∂vde Sweden when Volvo was still under Ford ownership. Half of the group's vehicles are fitted with an HDi diesel engine: in 2007 this amounted to approximately 1.8 million vehicles. As a result of a cooperation between BMW Group and PSA, the MINI One D and the MINI Cooper D are also fitted with PSA-made HDi DV engines. 1.4 The 1.4 L (1,398 cc) Diesel is part of the DV/DLD family and is, depending application, called the DV4 (PSA), or DLD-414 (Ford), or Suzuki Liana and Citroen C3 1.4 16v with 90PS 1.5 The 1.5 L (1,499 cc) Diesel is part of the DV/DLD family and is, depending application, called the DV5 (PSA), or DLD-415 (Ford). 1.6 The 1.6 L (1,560 cc) Diesel is part of the DV/DLD family and is, depending application, called the DV6 (PSA), W16 (MINI) or DLD-416 (Ford). 90 PS and 110 PS versions are available. Though both intercooled, the major difference being that the 90 PS has a conventional waste-gated Mitsubishi MHI TD025 turbo charger, whilst the 110 PS uses a Garrett GT15V variable geometry (VNT) turbocharger. The 110 PS version of this engine can be ordered in an unprecedented variety of car models, representing either side of the motoring spectrum, ranging from the MINI Cooper D to the Volvo S80 1.6D DRIVe. 2.0 The 8-valve, 2.0 L DW10, delivering , is part of the PSA EW/DW engine family. It is equipped with a fixed-geometry turbocharger. Initially available in the midsized models, such as the Citro√´n Xsara and Xantia and Peugeot 306 and 406, it was soon spread across the PSA range, such as the LCVs, while a 16-valve version, with 109 PS (80 kW), was used in the large MPVs built in association with Fiat. Suzuki was a customer for these powerplants, using them in the European Vitara and Grand Vitara. The PSA/Ford joint venture DW10B and DW10C engines use the same cylinder casing with a 16-valve head. They are fitted to the Ford Focus, 2007 Ford Mondeo, Ford Galaxy, Ford C-Max, Ford S-Max, Volvo C30, Volvo S40, Volvo V50, Citro√´n C5, Citro√´n C6, Peugeot 407, Peugeot 408 and Peugeot 5008. 2.7 V6 The 2.7 L DOHC 24-valve biturbo V6 DT17 is also produced by the Ford/PSA joint venture, and is also solely built in Dagenham. A variant of this engine for the use in Land-Rover, the so-called 'LR-TDV6 Diesel engine' rd at their Dunton and Whitley research centres. Another version, with only a single turbo is fitted to Australian made Ford Territory since 2011. Territory is a 5 or 7 seat Falcon based SUV vehicle, available in rear or all wheel drive. Territory production ceased in October 2016 when Ford closed its Australian manufacturing facility.  3.0 V6  The 3.0 L DOHC 24-valve biturbo V6 DT20 has replaced the 2.7 V6 HDi on PSA cars starting from 2009.

Desert Coral has been published in six languages: Japanese, Thai, English, German, Spanish, and French. Currently, there are five volumes in Japanese, four volumes in Thai, three volumes in English, and five volumes in German, Spanish, and French. The fifth and final Japanese volume was released May 2004. Plot The manga takes place on the fantasy world of Orgos. Naoto Saki is the main character. Naoto was summoned to Orgos by the sorceress Lusia during a battle with her rival, Camu. Naoto, who previously visited the world many times before through his dreams as an invisible entity, gains a body and becomes visible to everyone else in Orgos. Naoto is initially not a welcome visitor among the rest of Lusia's group (who call themselves \\"Desert Coral\\"), but their aloof and unfriendly attitude gradually changes over time. The group known as Desert Coral never clearly state what their intentions are, but they primarily seem to be together in order to destroy the Elphis, a sadistic semi-immortal race that lives in the 'superior levels' of Orgos. It is later revealed that Naoto had visited this world before when he was a child. These prior visits by Naoto were apparently a means to escape reality after the death of his little sister. The world of Orgos is also revealed to be a dream created by Naoto to escape reality. It is later discovered that Lotus, Lusia's older brother and in one way or another related to every member of Desert Coral, is trying to steal the world of Orgos from Naoto. Definitions Lucavifate- A race (to which Lotus and Lusia belong) of people with a very short life span, rarely reaching twenty years of age. During the first ten years of their lives they are peaceful, obedient, and kept as pets by the Elphis. When they reach ten years of age, a dormant power awakens and their blood causes them to hate the Elphis. When their power awakens, they become a serious threat to the Elphis, so they are usually disposed of before that can occur. They are described as having a beautiful face, and silver hair with red strands (portrayed as pink in the manga). Elphis- A race (to which Camu belongs) of semi-immortal beings who are sadistic, possess extreme magical potential, and control Orgos. They are one of the main antagonists of the story, with the exception of Camu, one of Desert Coral's members. In the manga, only four are seen. All of them have black hair and eyes. Characters Naoto Saki (Áõ¥‰∫∫„Çµ„Ç≠)- An average high school student who had dreams about a world called Orgos. He is able to receive good grades in school despite the fact that he sleeps all the time in class. He was first summoned to Orgos by Lotus, but when Naoto went back to his world he lost his memories and power. This changes one day when Lusia used a spell to summon him back to Orgos during a fight with Camu. He gradually recovers his memory along with his power. In the world of Orgos Naoto is described as a \\"God\\". The Dimensional Dragon becomes attached to him when Naoto finds it buried beneath a dead dragon. The dragon said \\"It's interesting to see a human with the same ability I have.\\" Epsilon describes him as an avatar of the Dimensional Dragon. He also described him as a \\"Monster\\" before Naoto lost his memories and power. He can create fire and then use it to make anything he thinks about become real. Lusia- A girl with pink hair and pink eyes who summoned Naoto to Orgos. She is a Lucavifate. As stated by Camu she doesn't have long to live because she is draining her own life to keep Naoto in Orgos. She is the leader of Desert Coral. Lusia is the younger twin sister of Lotus. She was captured by the Elphis when she was little, then she was saved by Lotus. She has the power to control fire. She tells Naoto she loves him in volume 3. Her real name is Coral. Lotus (ËìÆ„ÅÆËä±)- The older twin brother of Lusia. When he was little he was raised by Camu. He wanted Camu to teach him how to summon so he could summon a god that would destroy the world. He accomplished that when he summoned Naoto. When Lusia was kidnapped by Elphis he went to their lair and traded places with Lusia with the help of Levinas, because Lusia was going to be killed. He is killed by Levinas after becoming poisoned by hate. Epsilon („Ç§„Éó„Ç∑„É≠„É≥)- An expert swordsman. He used to be a lone traveller who walked around Orgos killing whenever he felt like it. His behavior becomes more calm after he meets Lotus. Epsilon, Lotus, and Luna form the first Desert Coral (although not actually naming it as such at that point). He is keeps his loyalty first to Lotus, and then to Lusia after Lotus is killed. Levinas („É¨„É¥„Ç£„Éä„Çπ)- A man who is also part cat. He has some experience in sword fighting, but not much. During the story he acts mostly as a mother figure to Desert Coral, and does most of the chores. He always stays by Lusia's side, having taken care of her from when he was a slave of Sildis. Lusia now regards Levinas as her pet. Camu- An Elphis who lives in the lower levels of Orgos. She is shown to be a skilled sorceress, although at times she puts people in danger by being careless. She took care of Lotus when he was small. She is shown to love both Lotus and Lusia. Because of this, she resists showing them how to summon since this would shorten their lives. Euro („É¶„Éº„É≠)- The youngest of the group. He Joined Desert Coral when he was saved by Lusia. He does not fight often during the course of the history, but does play an important role in keeping the group together. Although he acts like a male, probably due to his brother always treating him as such, he is shown near the end of the manga to be a girl. Chisato (ÂçÉÈáå)- Naoto's Childhood friend. She takes care of him most of the time. Dimensional Dragon (Ê¨°ÂÖÉÈæç)- A dragon who can cross between Orgos and Naoto's world. It has a special connection to Naoto and shows interest in him when the dragon first meets him. The Dimensional Dragon helped Lusia find the water spirit in volume 3. Near the end of the manga it is discovered that it was initially a cat who Chisato, Naoto, and Sa- chan took care of. Minor Characters Sa-chan Naoto's younger sister. She drowned in a river when Naoto was unable to help her. Luna A companion of Lotus and Epsilon when they first travelled. She is known to be in love with Epsilon. She is assassinated by Lotus for unknown reasons. Alt A member of the old Desert Coral, he accidentally kills Rekia and is then assassinated by Lotus. He is Euro's older brother. Kahla A member of the old Desert Coral and a powerful sorceress. She commits suicide after witnessing Lotus encouraging an old woman to suicide. Rekia A member of the old Desert Coral and cook. She believed blindly in everything Lotus said and is killed by Alt while protecting Naoto. Sladis An Elphis interested in Naoto's power. He is a sort of 'Mastermind' for the Elphis.

Biography He was born in Warsaw, Poland, and came to Philadelphia in 1866 when his father, Marcus Jastrow, a renowned Talmudic scholar, accepted a position as Rabbi of Congregation Rodeph Shalom. He was educated in the schools of Philadelphia, and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1881. His original intention was to become a rabbi. For this purpose, he carried on theological studies at the Jewish Seminary of Breslau in Germany while pursuing the study of Semitic languages at German universities. He traveled to Europe and studied at the University of Leipzig, where he received his Ph.D. in 1884. He then spent another year in the study of Semitic languages at the Sorbonne, the Coll√®ge de France and the √âcole des Langues Orientales Levant Vivantes. On his return to the United States in 1885, he was appointed assistant to his father in Philadelphia, which position he voluntarily resigned after one year. His farewell sermon, entitled \\"Jews and Judaism\\" was generally understood to be a personal repudiation of traditional Judaism. He went on to devote himself entirely to linguistic and archaeological studies. He gradually extended his field to include the history of religions. He joined the University of Pennsylvania in 1885 as an instructor of Semitic languages, and became professor of Semitic languages in 1891. In 1888, he became a librarian at the University of Pennsylvania, becoming librarian-in-chief in 1898. He was president of the American Oriental Society 1914-15, and of the Society of Biblical Literature in 1916. He died in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, in 1921. He contributed articles to, and was one of the editors of the scholarly Jewish Encyclopedia published 1901-1906 by the Jewish Publication Society; he was, as well, a contributor to the Encyclopaedia Biblica (1903), the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (11th edition), the New International Encyclopaedia and Webster's Dictionary. He edited a fragment of the Babylonian Dibbarra Epic (1891); the Aramaic text of the grammatical treatises of Abu Zakariyya Hayyug (1897); Selected Essays of James Darmesteter (with a memoir; translation of the essays from the original French by Helen Bachman Jastrow (Mrs. Morris Jastrow, Jr.), 1895); and a series of Handbooks on the History of Religion. A bibliography of his books, monographs and papers, covering the years 1885-1916, was compiled and published (for private circulation) by A. T. Clay and J. A. Montgomery. Among his students was Dr. Pezavia O'Connell, the first African-American scholar to earn a PhD in Semitic languages. In 1898, O'Connell wrote a dissertation under Jastrow's supervision at the University of Pennsylvania, entitled, Synonyms of the Unclean & the Clean in Hebrew.

He also worked on the phenomena of optical illusions, and a number of well-known optical illusions (such as the Jastrow illusion) were either discovered or popularized in his work. Jastrow believed that everyone had their own, often incorrect, preconceptions about psychology. One of his goals was to use the scientific method to identify truth from error, and educate the layperson, which he did through speaking tours, popular print media, and radio. Biography Jastrow was born in Warsaw, Poland. A son of Talmud scholar Marcus Jastrow, Joseph Jastrow was the younger brother of the orientalist, Morris Jastrow, Jr. Joseph Jastrow came to Philadelphia in 1866 and received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. During his doctoral studies at Johns Hopkins University, Jastrow worked with C. S. Peirce on experiments in psychophysics that introduced randomization and blinding for a repeated measures design.* From 1888 until his retirement in 1927, Jastrow was a professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he advised Clark L. Hull. He was a lecturer at the New School of Social Research from 1927 to 1933. Jastrow was head of the psychological section of the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, where he collected \\"psychophysical and reaction time data\\" from thousands of attendees. He was one of the charter members of the American Psychological Association, and became its president in 1900. Jastrow was noted for his outreach in popular media, exposing the general public to research in psychology. He gave public lectures, and was published in popular magazines, including Popular Science, Cosmopolitan, and Harper's Monthly. He also wrote Keeping Mentally Fit, a syndicated column that appeared in 150 newspapers. Jastrow suffered from bouts of depression throughout his life. He died in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.John F. Oppenheimer. (1971). Lexikon des Judentums. Bertelsmann. p. 321. His wife was Rachel Szold, a sister of Henrietta Szold. Elisabeth Jastrow, the classical archaeologist, was a cousin. His former home in Madison, Wisconsin is located in what is now the Langdon Street Historic District. Psychical research Jastrow was one of the founding members of the American Society for Psychical Research for study of the \\"mesmeric, psychical, and spiritual\\". The early members of the society were skeptical of paranormal phenomena; Jastrow took a psychological approach to psychical phenomena, believing that it was foolish to separate \\"... a class of problems from their natural habitat ...\\". By 1890 he had resigned from the society, and he became an outspoken critic of parapsychology. Psychical researchers were rarely trained psychologists, and Jastrow thought their research lacked credibility. Given the lack of evidence of psychical phenomena, he believed psychologists should not prioritize disproving claimed psychical phenomenon. In his book The Psychology of Conviction (1918) he included an entire chapter exposing what he called Eusapia Palladino's tricks.Joseph Jastrow. (1918). The Psychology of Conviction. Houghton Mifflin Company. pp. 101‚Äì127. Anomalistic psychology Jastrow was a leading figure in the field of anomalistic psychology.Leonard Zusne, Warren H. Jones. (1989). Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking. Psychology Press. pp. 10‚Äì12. His book Fact and Fable in Psychology (1900) debunked claims of occultism including Spiritualism, Theosophy and Christian Science. He approached the occult in a scientific manner. He wanted to understand why people were attracted to it, how it gained a foothold in society, and what evidence its supporters used. He wrote that many people considered coincidence, dreams, and premonitions as sources of information above science, and said the role of the scientist was to help the public understand truth from fiction, and to prevent the spreading of erroneous beliefs. Jastrow studied the psychology of paranormal belief and viewed paranormal phenomena as \\"totally unscientific and misleading\\", being the result of delusion, fraud, gullibility and irrationality.Lawrence R. Samuel. (2011). Supernatural America: A Cultural History. Praeger. pp. 9‚Äì10.  Other research= Use of analogy in society  Jastrow thought that analogies represented a more primitive way of interpreting the world. He gave many examples of cultures that acted analogously, including the \\"Zulu chewing a bit of wood to soften the heart ...\\", and the \\"Illinois Indians making figures of those whose days they desire to shorten, and stabbing these images in the heart.\\" He wrote about cultures that ate animals to gain their physical attributes; he said this tradition still persisted in his day, through superstitions, rituals, and folk medicine. The underlying motivation for this mentality, Jastrow wrote, was that \\"one kind of connection ... will bring it to others.\\"  Optical illusions  alt= Jastrow was interested in perception, especially eyesight. He thought that eyesight was more complex than a camera, and that the mental processing of images was central to interpretation of the world. He illustrated this through optical illusions, including the rabbit-duck illusion. He believed that what people saw also depended on their emotional state and their surroundings.  Involuntary movement The automatograph To detect unconscious movement of the hand, Jastrow invented a machine he called the automagraph. He found that when a subject was asked to concentrate on an object, their hand moved unconsciously in that direction. The magnitude of the effect varied across individuals, especially in children, where the movement was more random.  Dreams of the blind  Jastrow found that people who had lost their eyesight after age six still were able to see in their dreams, and that people who had lost their eyesight before the age of five could not. This same difference in perception and age was true for people with partial vision loss. Jastrow concluded that sight was not innate, and that significant mental development occurred between ages five and seven. He noted that hearing, not sensation, was the primary sense of the blind, in both waking and dream. He collected first-hand accounts of dreams from visually impaired people, including Helen Keller. Publications Jastrow's publications include:    \\"Charles Peirce as a Teacher\\" in The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods, v. 13, n. 26, December, 723‚Äì726 (1916).

In the 1950s, the network expanded when Emisoras Fuentes (Cartagena de Indias), Emisoras Unidas (Barranquilla) and RCO Radiodifusora de Occidente (Cali) became affiliates. In 1952 Caracol would create a second station, Radio Reloj, which would become the first station with an all-music format, with a time mention between songs. In 1956, Caracol owned and operated four stations: La Voz de Antioquia (Compa√±√≠a Colombiana de Radiodifusi√≥n, Medell√≠n, HJDM, currently Radio Reloj Medell√≠n), La Voz del R√≠o Cauca (Cali, currently Caracol Cali, HJED), Emisoras Nuevo Mundo and Radio Reloj. The first three created in 1956 the so-called Tri√°ngulo de Oro (\\"Gold triangle\\"), with 50 kW each, in order to broadcast the Vuelta a Colombia. La Voz del R√≠o Cauca could be heard as far as Argentina. In 1960, Fernando Londo√±o Henao, a prominent member of the Colombian Conservative Party, became its president. Between 1958 and 1963, Caracol would acquire several stations, such as Emisora Mil 20, Emisoras Eldorado and La Voz de Colombia (Bogot√°), Radio Reloj (Panama), Sociedad Informativa de Contrapunto, La Voz del Caf√© (Pereira), Pregones del Quind√≠o (Armenia), Radio Comercio (Bucaramanga), and Radio Visi√≥n (Medell√≠n), and absorb small networks as Cadena Radial Andina and Sociedad Nacional de Radiodifusi√≥n. In 1967 Caracol TV was spun off from Caracol Radio. In 1970 it would acquire exclusive broadcasting rights for the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. In 1986 Caracol Radio would rent the stations of the N√∫cleo Radial Bienvenida. In the same year Julio Mario Santo Domingo would acquire the 50% of both Caracol Radio and Caracol TV, with 25% belonging to Alfonso L√≥pez Michelsen, and the other 25% for the family of Fernando Londo√±o Henao. In 1990 it would acquire Radio Sutatenza, a network of educational radio stations founded in 1947 which was having financial problems. Radio Sutatenza was the only network in Colombia with transmitters over 50 kW. On 12 August 2010 at 05:30 (10:30 UTC), a car bomb exploded outside the headquarters of the network, which did not interrupt its broadcast, despite having its building's tiles and windows shattered. FARC were held responsible for the attack.

In 1963, Magliocco participated in an audacious attempt to kill other family bosses and take over the Mafia Commission. The attempt failed, and his life spared, but was forced into retirement. Soon after, he died of a heart attack on December 28, 1963. Background Magliocco was born in Portella di Mare, a frazione in the comune of Misilmeri, in the province of Palermo, in Sicily. Magliocco's nickname, \\"Joe Malayak,\\" came from the word Maluk, which meant \\"ruler\\". Despite weighing over 300 pounds, Magliocco was described as being very energetic and decisive in his work and physical gestures, someone who exuded danger and confidence. Magliocco lived on a six-acre waterfront estate in East Islip, New York. He was the silent partner in a liquor company, Alpine Wine and Liquor, and a linen company, Arrow Linen Supply. In 1963, it was suspected that Magliocco was using his clout to force bars and restaurants to buy from both companies. According to Joseph Bonanno, Magliocco was an excellent Italian chef and loved to eat. Magliocco's son, Ambrose Magliocco, was a capo. Magliocco's second cousin and brother-in-law was mob boss Joseph Profaci, founder of the Profaci crime family. Magliocco was an in-law of consigliere and underboss Salvatore Mussachio, related by marriage to Buffalo crime family boss Stefano Magaddino, and uncle to the wife of Bonanno crime family founder Joseph Bonanno. Early years As a young man, Magliocco became involved in illegal gambling and union racketeering. On December 5, 1928, Magliocco and Profaci attended a meeting of New York mobsters at the Statler Hotel in Cleveland, Ohio. The main topic was dividing the Brooklyn territory of the recently murdered boss Salvatore D'Aquila without causing a gang war. By the end of the meeting, Profaci had received a share of the open territory, and named Magliocco as his second-in-command‚Äîa post he would hold for the next 34 years. When the Cleveland Police raided the meeting, Magliocco was briefly detained on an illegal weapons charge. In 1931, the Castellammarese War began in New York between two powerful Italian-American gangs. Both Profaci and Magliocco attempted to stay neutral during this conflict. By the end of 1931, the war was over and the New York gangs were divided into five crime families supervised by a Mafia Commission. Profaci and Magliocco were confirmed as boss and underboss, respectively, of what was now known as the Profaci crime family. Colombo War In 1957, Magliocco was arrested with 60 other mobsters who were attending the Apalachin Conference, a national mob meeting in Apalachin, New York. On January 13, 1960, Magliocco and 21 others were convicted of conspiracy and he was sentenced to five years in prison. However, on November 28, 1960, a United States Court of Appeals overturned the verdicts. On February 27, 1961 the Gallos led by Joe Gallo, kidnapped four of Profaci's top men: underboss Magliocco, Frank Profaci (Joe Profaci's brother), capo Salvatore Musacchia and soldier John Scimone. Profaci himself eluded capture and flew to sanctuary in Florida. While holding the hostages, Larry and Albert Gallo sent Joe Gallo to California. The Gallos demanded a more favorable financial scheme for the hostages' release. Gallo wanted to kill one hostage and demand $100,000 before negotiations, but his brother Larry overruled him. After a few weeks of negotiation, Profaci made a deal with the Gallos. Profaci's consigliere Charles \\"the Sidge\\" LoCicero negotiated with the Gallos and all the hostages were released peacefully.Capeci (2001), p.303 However, Profaci had no intention of honoring this peace agreement. On August 20, 1961 Joseph Profaci ordered the murder of Gallo members Joseph \\"Joe Jelly\\" Gioielli and Larry Gallo. Gunmen allegedly murdered Gioilli after inviting him to go fishing. Larry Gallo survived a strangulation attempt in the Sahara club of East Flatbush by Carmine Persico and Salvatore \\"Sally\\" D'Ambrosio after a police officer intervened.Raab (2006), pp.321-324 The Gallo brothers had been previously aligned with Persico against Profaci and his loyalists;Cage, Nicholas (July 17, 1972) \\"Part II The Mafia at War\\" New York pp.27-36 The Gallos then began calling Persico \\"The Snake\\" after he had betrayed them. the war continued on resulting in nine murders and three disappearances. With the start of the gang war, the Gallo crew retreated to the Dormitory. Family boss On June 6, 1962, Profaci died of liver cancer and Magliocco became the family boss. However, the Mafia Commission did not endorse him as the new family leader. Afraid that the other New York families viewed him as weak, Magliocco increased the tempo of violence against the Gallo faction. In turn, car bombs, drive-by shootings, and other murder attempts were made against Magliocco men such as Carmine Persico and his enforcer, Hugh McIntosh. In 1963, with the jailing of Gallo and several associates, the hostilities temporarily ended. Commission plot In 1963, Joseph Bonanno, the head of the Bonanno crime family, made plans to assassinate several rivals on the Mafia Commission‚Äîbosses Tommy Lucchese, Carlo Gambino, and Stefano Magaddino, as well as Frank DeSimone.Staff (September 1, 1967) \\"The Mob: How Joe Bonanno Schemed to kill ‚Äì and lost\\" Life p.15-21 Bonanno sought Magliocco's support, and Magliocco readily agreed. Not only was he bitter from being denied a seat on the Commission, but Bonanno and Profaci had been close allies for over 30 years prior to Profaci's death. Bonanno's audacious goal was to take over the Commission and make Magliocco his right hand man. Magliocco was assigned the task of killing Lucchese and Gambino, and gave the contract to one of his top hit men, Joseph Colombo. However, the opportunistic Colombo revealed the plot to its targets. The other bosses quickly realized that Magliocco could not have planned this himself. Remembering how close Bonanno was with Magliocco (and before him, Profaci), as well as their close ties through marriages, the other bosses concluded Bonanno was the real mastermind. The Commission summoned Bonanno and Magliocco to explain themselves. Fearing for his life, Bonanno went into hiding in Montreal, leaving Magliocco to deal with the Commission. Badly shaken and in failing health, Magliocco confessed his role in the plot. The Commission spared Magliocco's life, but forced him to retire as Profaci family boss and pay a $50,000 fine. As a reward for turning on his boss, Colombo was awarded the Profaci family. Death On December 28, 1963, Joseph Magliocco died of a heart attack at Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center in West Islip, New York. Magliocco is buried in Saint Charles Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York. In 1969, the authorities exhumed Magliocco's body to determine if he had been poisoned. This action was taken based on FBI phone tapings in which DeCavalcante crime family boss Sam DeCavalcante suggested that Joseph Bonanno poisoned Magliocco. However, no traces of poison were found in the body and it was re-interred at Saint Charles. ReferencesFurther reading *Bonanno, Bill, Bound by Honor: A Mafioso's Story.

There is only one fossil known of Scipionyx, discovered in 1981 by an amateur paleontologist and brought to the attention of science in 1993. In 1998 the type species Scipionyx samniticus was named, the generic name meaning \\"Scipio's claw\\". The find generated much publicity because of the unique preservation of large areas of petrified soft tissue and internal organs such as muscles and intestines. The fossil shows many details of these, even the internal structure of some muscle and bone cells. It was also the first dinosaur found in Italy. Because of the importance of the specimen, it has been intensely studied. The fossil is that of a juvenile only half a metre (twenty inches) long and perhaps just three days old. The adult size is estimated to have been about two metres (6.5 feet). Scipionyx was a bipedal predator, its horizontal rump balanced by a long tail. Its body was probably covered by primitive feathers but these have not been found in the fossil, that is without any skin remains. In the guts of the fossil some half-digested meals are still present, indicating Scipionyx ate lizards and fish. Perhaps these had been fed to the young animal by its parents. Several scientists have tried to learn from the position of the internal organs how Scipionyx breathed, but their conclusions often disagree. History of discovery and naming The village of Pietraroja with, immediately above it, the quarry Scipionyx was discovered in the spring of 1981 by Giovanni Todesco, an amateur paleontologist, in the small Le Cavere quarry at the edge of the village of Pietraroja, approximately seventy kilometers northeast of Naples. The specimen was preserved in the marine Pietraroja Formation, well known for unusually well-conserved fossils. Todesco thought the remains belonged to an extinct bird. He prepared the strange discovery in the basement of his house in San Giovanni Ilarione near Verona, removing, without the use of any optical instrument, part of the chalk matrix from the top of the bones and covering them with vinyl glue. He strengthened the stone plate by adding pieces to its rim and on one of these he added a fake tail made from polyester resin as that of the fossil was largely lacking because he had failed to recover it completely. In early 1993 Todesco, who had nicknamed the animal cagnolino, \\"little doggie\\", after its toothy jaws, brought the specimen to the attention of paleontologist Giorgio Teruzzi of the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano, who identified it as the juvenile of a theropod dinosaur and nicknamed it Ambrogio after the patron saint of Milan, Ambrose. Not being an expert in the field of dinosaur studies himself, he called in the help of colleague Father Giuseppe Leonardi. In Italy such finds are by law State property and Todesco was convinced by science reporter Franco Capone to report the discovery to the authorities: on 15 October 1993 Todesco personally delivered the fossil to the Archaeological Directorship at Naples. The specimen was added to the collection of the regional Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici di Salerno, Avellino, Benevento e Caserta in Salerno, to which it officially still belongs; on 19 April 2002 it was given its own display at the Museo Archeologico di Benevento. Cristiano Dal Sasso with a cast of the type specimen in 2012 In 1993 Teruzzi and Leonardi scientifically reported the find,Leonardi, G. & Teruzzi, G., 1993, \\"Prima segnalazione di uno scheletro fossile di dinosauro (Theropoda, Coelurosauria) in Italia (Cretacico di Pietraroia, Benevento)\\", Paleocronache 1993: 7-14 which generated some publicity as it was the very first dinosaur found in Italy.Dal Sasso, C. and Signore, M., 1998, \\"Scipionyx samniticus (Saurischia, Theropoda): the first Italian dinosaur\\", Third European Workshop on Vertebrate Paleontology, Abstract: 23 The popular magazine Oggi simultaneously nicknamed the animal Ciro, a typical Neapolitan boy's name, an idea by chief-editor Pino Aprile.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages. In 1994 Leonardi published a larger article about the discovery.Leonardi, G. & Avanzini, M., 1994, \\"Dinosauri in Italia\\", Le Scienze (Quaderni), 76: 69-81 In 1995 Marco Signore of the University of Naples Federico II submitted a thesis containing a lengthy description of the fossil, in which he named it \\"Dromaeodaimon irene\\".Signore, M., 1995, Il teropode del Plattenkalk della Civita di Pietraroia (Cretaceo inferiore, Bn). Thesis, Dip. Paleont. Univ. Napoli \\"Federico II\\" Because the thesis was unpublished this remained an invalid nomen ex dissertatione. Meanwhile, in Salerno, Sergio Rampinelli had begun a further preparation of the fossil, during three hundred hours of work removing the fake tail, replacing the vinyl glue with a modern resin preservative and finishing the uncovering of the bones. On this occasion it was discovered that large parts of the soft tissues had been preserved. In 1998, Ciro because of this made the front cover of Nature, when the type species Scipionyx samniticus was named and described by Marco Signore and Cristiano Dal Sasso.Dal Sasso, C. and Signore, M. (1998). \\"Exceptional soft tissue preservation in a theropod dinosaur from Italy.\\" Nature, 392: 383-387. The generic name Scipionyx comes from the Latin name Scipio and the Greek ·ΩÑŒΩœÖŒæ, onyx, the combination meaning \\"Scipio's claw\\". \\"Scipio\\" refers to both Scipione Breislak, the 18th century geologist who wrote the first description of the formation in which the fossil was found and Scipio Africanus, the famous Roman consul fighting Hannibal. The specific name samniticus means \\"From Samnium\\", the Latin name of the region around Pietraroja. Several other names had been considered but rejected, such as \\"Italosaurus\\", \\"Italoraptor\\" and \\"Microraptor\\".Cristiano Dal Sasso & Giuseppe Brillante, 2001, Dinosauri italiani, Marsilio pp 256 The last name has since been used for a genus of \\"four-winged\\" dromaeosaurid discovered in China a few years later. The holotype, SBA-SA 163760, dates from the early Albian, about 110 million years old, and consists of an almost complete skeleton of a juvenile individual, lacking only the end of the tail, the lower legs and the claw of the right second finger. Extensive soft tissues have been preserved but no parts of the skin or any integument such as scales or feathers.Dal Sasso, C. and Signore, M., 1998, \\"Scipionyx samniticus (Theropoda: Coelurosauria) and its exceptionally well preserved internal organs\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 18 (3): 37A In view of the exceptional importance of the find, between December 2005 and October 2008 the fossil was intensively studied in Milan resulting in a monograph by dal Sasso and Simone Maganuco published in 2011,Cristiano dal Sasso & Simone Maganuco, 2011, Scipionyx samniticus (Theropoda: Compsognathidae) from the Lower Cretaceous of Italy ‚Äî Osteology, ontogenetic assessment, phylogeny, soft tissue anatomy, taphonomy and palaeobiology, Memorie della Societ√† Italiana de Scienze Naturali e del Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano XXXVII(I): 1-281 containing the most extensive description of a single dinosaur species ever. Description=Size Size of the juvenile specimen compared with a human The holotype of Scipionyx represents a very small individual, the preserved length being just 237 millimetres. In 2011 dal Sasso & Maganuco estimated its total length, including the missing tail section, at 461 millimetres. The specimen was not much smaller than known embryos or hatchlings of Lourinhasaurus and Allosaurus, theropods of considerable magnitude. However, given its affinities with the Compsognathidae, it is likely that the adult size of Scipionyx did not surpass that of the largest known compsognathid, Sinocalliopteryx of 237 centimetres length. As the hatchling would have fitted within an egg about eleven centimetres long and six centimetres wide, this would have implied a rather high egg size compared to the adult body length. General build Restoration Because the holotype is a hatchling of perhaps only a few days old, it is hard to determine the build of the adult animal but some general conclusions can be reliably made. Scipionyx was a small bipedal predator. Its horizontal rump was balanced by a long tail. The neck was relatively long and slender. The hindlimbs and especially the forelimbs were rather elongated. Dal Sasso & Maganuco considered it likely that a coat of primitive protofeathers was present, as these are also known from some direct relatives. Diagnostic traits The 2011 study established eight unique derived traits or autapomorphies in which Scipionyx differed from its closest relatives. The praemaxilla has five teeth. Where the parietal and the frontal bone make contact, the depression in which the supratemporal fenestra, a skull roof opening, was present, shows a sinuous ridge on the postorbital. The lower branch of the squamosal has a rectangular end. The wrist consists of just two, superimposed, bones: a radial and a lower element formed by a fusion of the first and second carpal. This last element has the shape of a lens, not a crescent; is flattened; and is fused seamlessly. The first finger is conspicuously elongated, 23% longer than the third finger. The notch in the front edge of the ilium is directed to the front and only weakly developed. The front edge of the ischium shaft has a long obturator process with a rectangular end. Skull Skull, Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano The skull of the holotype is large, compared to the size of the body, and short with very large eye-sockets. This is largely due to its young age. Accordingly, the semi-circular antorbital fenestra, the normally largest skull opening, is short too and smaller than the eye-socket. In front of it two smaller openings are present: the maxillary and promaxillary. The snout is pointed with a low rounded tip. The premaxilla, the bone forming the front of the snout, carries five teeth. The maxilla behind it, is deep with a very short front branch. It carries seven teeth. The depression in its surface for the antorbital opening is bounded by a ridge. The lacrimal is robust and lacks a horn; its side is not pierced by a foramen. The prefrontal is exceptionally large, forming a large part of the front upper edge of the eye-socket. The frontal bones have a transverse ridge at their back. Between the frontals and the parietals the skull roof over a limited distance has not closed yet, resulting in a conspicuous diamond-shaped opening, a fontanelle that was first mistaken for damage inflicted on the fossil during the first preparation. On its inner side the supratemporal fenestra has no depression, being bounded by a high edge of the parietal. The jugal has no front vertical branch towards the lacrimal. The quadrate bone has on its front edge a large wing-like expansion, touching the pterygoid. The bones of the braincase are largely inaccessible but a small inner ear opening, the recessus tympanicus dorsalis, is visible. The underside of the braincase lacks an inflated part or bulla. The lower jaw is straight and elongated. The jaw bone is rather low: the specimen creates the illusion of a strong jaw because the left jaw is visible below the right one. It bears ten teeth. In the 1998 description a part of the splenial was mistaken for a supradentarium and the angular was misidentified as the surangular because in the fossil it had been displaced upwards, creating the false impression an external mandibular fenestra, an opening in the outer side of the jaw, would be present. Scipionyx has five teeth in the premaxilla, seven in the maxilla and ten in the dentary of the lower jaw for a total of twenty-two per side and a grand total for the head of forty-four. The number of five premaxillary teeth is surprising, as a total of four is normal for compsognathids: otherwise, only some Carnosauria have five. Due to the young age of the specimen, the tooth replacement cycle had not started yet, causing a perfect dental symmetry between the left and the right jaws. The teeth lack the typical compsognathid shape with a suddenly recurving apex of the tooth crown. Instead, in general they curve gradually; only the largest teeth show something of a \\"kink\\". Exceptionally, the tooth row of the lower jaw extends further to the back than that of the upper jaw. The premaxillary teeth are pointed and lack denticles. The first four have an oval cross- section; the fifth is more flattened near its apex. The second and fifth teeth are the largest. The maxillary teeth are flattened with denticles on their trailing edges. The second and fourth maxillary teeth are the largest; the latter being the largest tooth of all. Of the ten teeth of the lower jaw, the first two are rather straight with an oval cross-section and lack denticles. The third tooth has denticles at its base and a flatter top; the other seven are more recurved and flattened along their entire height; gradually the denticles reach the apex. Postcrania The complete slab; the pieces added by Todesco have not been removed The vertebral column of Scipionyx probably includes ten cervical vertebrae and thirteen dorsal vertebrae; due to the fact the specimen is just a hatchling, the differentiation between the two categories has not fully developed, making any distinction rather arbitrary. With certainty five sacral vertebrae are present. The fossil has preserved just nine tail vertebrae; likely fifty or more had been originally present. The neck vertebrae are opisthocoelous. The axis is pneumatised as a pneumatopore, an opening through which a diverticulum of the air sack of the neck base could reach its hollow interior, is visible on its side. The third, fourth and fifth vertebrae also show pneumatopores but the consecutive series lacks them, which is surprising as it had been assumed the pneumatisation process would have started at the back, working itself forward. Contrary to what was stated by the 1998 study, the cervical ribs are very elongated, with a length of up to three vertebral centra. The vertebrae of the back are not pneumatised. They are amphiplatyan with an oval cross-section and bear low spines with a hexagonal profile. Just below the top of the spine on the front and back edge a small beak-shaped process is present. In 1998 interpreted as a reduced hyposphene-hypantrum complex, a system of secondary vertebral joints shown by many theropods, it was by the 2011 study seen as a pair of attachment points for tendons, as identified in 2006 in Compsognathus. Exceptionally, with the thirteenth vertebra the two rib joint processes, the parapophysis and the diapophysis, are positioned at the same level. The five sacral vertebrae have not yet fused into a real sacrum. The tail vertebrae are platycoelous with low spines and backward slanting chevrons. There are at least twelve pairs of dorsal ribs; some displaced elements might represent a thirteenth pair. The third and fourth rib have expanded lower ends that in life probably were attached to cartilaginous sternal ribs, themselves connected to sterna that in the holotype specimen have not (yet) ossified. The lower rump is covered by a basket of eighteen pairs of gastralia or belly ribs. Mysterious shaft parts present near the forelimbs are by Dal Sasso & Maganuco interpreted as the remains of a nineteenth frontmost element consisting of two completely fused shafts homologous to the normal medial elements of a pair of gastralia; such a chevron-like bone has also been reported with Juravenator. The gastralia form a herringbone pattern, the left and right medial elements overlapping each other at their forked ends in order that the basket can expand and contract to accommodate the breathing movements of the abdomen. The scapula is relatively straight and about six to seven times longer than wide; its upper end is missing. Its lower end is connected to a semicircular coracoid. The furcula is broad and more or less U-shaped with its two branches angled at 125¬∞. The forelimb is rather long; its length is equal to 48% of the body length in front of the pelvis. Especially the hand is elongated as is typical for compsognathids; for a member of that group Scipionyx has a relatively short hand, however. The humerus is straight with a moderately developed deltopectoral crest. The ulna is slender and cylinder-shaped with a length of 70% of that of the humerus. The wrist consists of two elements only: a radial bone capping the lower end of the radius and a disc-shaped bone below it; this is either the enlarged first lower carpal or a perfect seamless fusion of the first and second lower carpal. The metacarpus is compact and moderately elongated. Its three elements mirror the shape of the fingers they bear: the first is the shortest en thickest; the second the longest; and the third is intermediate in length and thickness. The third finger is exceptionally long for a comspognathid, with 123% of thumb length. As the lower joint of the first metacarpal is bevelled, the thumb diverges medially. Its claw is no larger than that of the second finger. The hand claws are moderately curved. In the pelvis the ilium is short and flat with a slightly convex upper profile. The back end is rectangular, the front edge has an appending hook-shaped point and near its top a circular notch, a trait that is usually considered a synapomorphy of the Tyrannosauroidea. The pubic bone points almost vertically downwards and is thus \\"mesopubic\\" or \\"orthopubic\\". It is relatively short with about two thirds of the length of the femur. It has a short \\"foot\\" shaped like a golf club. The ischium has three quarters the length of the pubis, set at an angle of 54¬∞ to it. It ends in a small expansion. On the front of its shaft a large hatchet-shaped obturator process is present, the attachment for the Musculus puboischiofemoralis externus, that lacks a small circular notch between its lower edge and the shaft, though this lack is normally associated with the possession of a lower triangular processus obturatorius. Of the hindlimb, the lower leg is missing. The femur or thigh bone is straight and robust. The lesser trochanter is markedly lower than the greater trochanter and separated from it by a narrow cleft. It has the shape of a wing-like expansion to the front. An accessory or posterior trochanter is lacking; likewise a fourth trochanter on the back shaft is absent. The tibia has only a weak cnemial crest, separated from its outer condyle by a deep narrow groove, the incisura tibialis. The fibula is broad on top but has a slender shaft. Soft tissues Close up of the front limbs and gut region The holotype preserves an exceptionally large set of soft tissues for a fossil dinosaur. Although some muscle tissue (Santanaraptor, Pelecanimimus), cartilage (Juravenator, AucasaurusCarrano, M.T. & Sampson S.D. 2008. \\"The phylogeny of Ceratosauria\\". Journal of Systematic Palaeontology 6(2): 183-236) or an intestine (Mirischia) have been reported from other dinosaurs, Scipionyx is unique in preserving in some form examples from most major internal organ groups: blood, blood vessels, cartilage, connective tissues, bone tissue, muscle tissue, horn sheaths, the respiratory system and the digestive system. Nervous tissue and the external skin, including possible scales or feathers, are absent. The soft tissues are not present in the form of imprints but as three-dimensional petrifications, having been replaced by calcium phosphate in amazing detail, even to the subcellular level; or as transformed remains of the original biomolecular components. =Bone tissue= The original bone tissue is no longer present but the calcium phosphate mineralisation has preserved the structure of original bone cells, showing individual osteocytes including their inner hollow spaces and the canaliculi. Also the internal blood vessels of the bone have been preserved, in some cases still empty inside. On some bones, including some of the skull and lower jaws, the periosteum is still visible. =Ligaments and cartilage= From the ninth cervical vertebra to the back, the vertebral joints show the remains of articular capsules. Between the spines at places very thin interspinal and supraspinal ligaments are visible. Six vertebrae are visibly capped by cartilaginous synchondroses, a typical juvenile feature. Cartilaginous caps are also present on all limb joints, even the smallest, and are especially thick in the shoulder, elbow and wrist joints. Also the pubic foot is capped and the ilium and pubic bone are separated by cartilage. =Respiratory system= Of the respiratory system little has been preserved. No traces of the lungs have survived, nor of any air sacks. The sole element still present consists of a seven millimetre long piece of the trachea of which about ten tracheal rings are visible, the most anterior of which are open at the top, giving them a C-shape. They have an average length of 0.33 millimetres and are separated by 0.17 millimetre thick interspaces. The trachea is quite thin, with a preserved width of one millimetre about half as wide as would be expected for an animal the size of the holotype, and positioned rather low in the neck base, embedded in connective tissue. =Liver, heart, spleen and thymus= In the front part of the thorax a conspicuous red halo is visible, forming a roughly circular stain with a diameter of seventeen millimetres. In 1998 it was suggested this might represent the remains of the decayed liver, a blood-rich organ. That the red pigment was indeed derived from blood was in 2011 confirmed: a scanning electron microscope analysis indicated that the substance consisted of limonite, hydrated iron oxide, a likely transformation product of the original haemoglobin. Also biliverdine was present, a bile component expected in the liver. The blood might also partly have originated from the heart and the spleen, two similarly blood-rich organs, with reptiles positioned between the two lobes of the liver. Another organ in the thorax, traces of which might be present, is the thymus, which might have contributed to a greyish mass of organic origin visible in the neck base; this also contains connective and muscle tissue. =Digestive system= A diagram showing the organs preserved in the Scipionyx holotype The digestive tract can mostly be traced, either because the intestines are still present or by the presence of food items. The position of the oesophagus is indicated by a five millimetre long series of small food particles. Below the ninth dorsal vertebra the location of the stomach is shown by a cluster of bones of prey animals, the organ itself likely having been dissolved by its own stomach acid shortly after death. The rather backward position of the cluster suggests the stomach was dual in structure, with a forward enzyme-secreting proventriculus preceding a muscular gizzard. Gastroliths have not been reported. Just behind the presumed position of the stomach a very conspicuous large and thick intestine is visible, that has been identified as the duodenum. It is preserved partly in the form of a natural endocast, partly as a petrification still showing the cellular structure, including the mucosa and connective tissue. Some mesenteric blood vessels cover the intestine in the form of up to a centimetre long and 0.02 to 0.1 millimetre wide hollow tubes. The duodenum forms a large loop, the descending part of which first is directed downwards towards the gastralia and then runs to the back. There in a sharp bend, the folds of which are clearly visible, it turns to the front, proceeding as an ascending tract, its visible part ending near the stomach. At this point the tract is directed to the left of the body, perpendicular to the fossil slab, and its course can thus no longer be followed. Nearby and slightly above, a subsequent intestine part surfaces that has been interpreted as the jejunum. This thinner intestine turns to the back, running parallel to the ascending tract of the duodenum and ultimately disappearing under it, at the level of the twelfth dorsal vertebra. Apparently a loop to the front is made because it resurfaces below the tenth dorsal vertebra, first running upwards and then turning to the back below the hind vertebral column ‚Äî or at places even over it: probably after death its position partly shifted upwards. The jejunum seems to blend with an exceptionally short ileum. A contraction below the thirteenth dorsal vertebra might indicate the transition to the rectum. A caecum seems absent. The rectum runs to the back between the upper shafts of the pubes and ischia. Then it bends downwards parallel to the ischium shaft, at the end of it turning upwards again. In this final part faeces are still present. The cloaca is lacking. Dal Sasso & Maganuco suggested the cloaca exit was rather low, at the level of the ischial feet and that a rectocoprodaeal valve separated faeces and urine. Between the front edge of the pubic shafts and the back of the intestines a large empty space is present. Also, the rectum seems to run in a very high position as if it were forced upwards by something. According to Dal Sasso & Maganuco, in life this space would have been filled by the yolk sac of the hatchling; on hatching the juveniles of reptiles typically have not absorbed all the yolk and use the residual nutrients to supplement the food intake during their first weeks. =Muscle tissue= At several places on the fossil muscle tissue is present. The degree of preservation is often exceptional, with not only the individual fibres still discernible but also the individual cells and even the subcellular sarcomeres. Among dinosaur fossils such sarcomeres are only known from Santanaraptor, whose muscle fibres are four times as thick. The original organic material has been replaced by small hollow globes, the walls of which consist of euhedric crystals of apatite. In the grey organic mass at the neck base, muscle fibres are present that have been identified as belonging to the Musculus sternohyoideus and the Musculus sternotrachealis. Between the sixth and seventh dorsal vertebra a patch of muscle fibres is visible belonging to either the Musculus transversospinalis or the Musculus longissimus dorsi. In front of the right ischium muscle fibres are present running from the ischial foot in the direction of the femur. Their identity is uncertain: they could belong to the Musculus puboischiofemoralis pars medialis (the Musculus adductor femoris I of crocodiles) but in that case this muscle with (some) non-avian theropods would not be anchored on the obturator process. The fibres could also represent an unknown muscle. In any case they refute a conjecture by Gregory S. Paul that there would be no muscle connection between the ischium and the femur at all. Above the rectum tract a large area of horizontal unsegmented muscle fibres is present, probably representing the unsegmented Musculus caudofemoralis longus of the tail base, the main retractor muscle operating on the thighbone. These fibres are polygonal in cross-section and show the intercellular spaces also. Below some tail base vertebrae the connective ligaments between the chevrons are present, forming the ligmamentum interhaemale, but also some small muscle fibres and some mysterious hollow tubes arranged in a herringbone pattern; the latter perhaps represent the myosepta of the myotomes, the segments of the Musculus iliocaudalis or the Musculus ischiocaudalis. =Horn sheaths= On all claws preserved in the fossil ‚Äî those of the feet have all been lost ‚Äî horn sheaths are visible. These have a darker colouration on top than on the bottom which suggests that the original horn material is still present ‚Äî but this has not yet been directly tested by a chemical analysis for fear of damaging these delicate structures that were seen as forming an essential part of the integrity of the precious specimen. The horn sheaths of the hand claws extend the bony cores by about 40%, scythe-like continuing the bone curve and ending in sharp points. On some claws the sheaths have partly detached; on others they have been flattened or split. =Integument= museum exhibition The fossil preserves no traces of any skin, scales or feathers. In 1999 Philip J. Currie hypothesised this might be otherwise, suggesting the tubes found on the tail base would represent the filaments of protofeathers. In 2011, however, Dal Sasso & Maganuco rejected this interpretation because the tubes taper at both ends, while integument filaments are expected to have only a tapered top end. Nevertheless, they considered it likely that Scipionyx in life had protofeathers as these are known to be present with the compsognathids Sinosauropteryx and Sinocalliopteryx. Phylogeny Scipionyx was by the describers assigned to the Coelurosauria, a group of theropods. Because the only remains recovered belong to that of a juvenile, it has proven difficult to assign this dinosaur to a more specific group. One problem is that in the build of a juvenile animal the original traits of ancestor groups are more likely to be expressed, suggesting a too basal position in the evolutionary tree. Part of the 2011 monograph was a cladistic analysis which indicated that Scipionyx was a basal member of the Compsognathidae and the sister species of Orkoraptor. Dal Sasso & Maganuco emphasised that, due to its limited remains, the position of Orkoraptor is tentative. This cladogram shows the position of Scipionyx in the coelurosaurian tree, according to the 2011 study: Paleobiology=Habitat A restoration of Scipionyx playing with a stick on a beach. The location where Scipionyx was found, in the Albian was part of the Apulian Plate, at the time largely covered by the shallow Paratethys. Some dry land was present however, but it is uncertain how extensive or connected the several terranes were. The marine sediments of the Pietraroja Plattenkalk were probably deposited closely to a piece of the Apennine Platform, which piece possibly formed a small island between the present middle of Italy and Tunisia. From this it has been concluded that the habitat of Scipionyx in general consisted of small islands and it represented one of the larger animals of its ecosystem. However, there are also indications that the terranes regularly interconnected to form far more extensive islands, land bridges allowing a dispersal of much larger animals, such as sauropods and large theropods. If so, they were not present for long when the land surface fragmented again, because there are no signs of insular dwarfism, a size reduction as an adaptation to decreased resources. Likewise, Scipionyx itself is no dwarf among its relatives. Due to its small absolute size, Scipionyx would have been able to maintain itself when the dry land shrank. Nevertheless, Dal Sasso & Maganuco did not consider Scipionyx to have been a permanent resident of small islands throughout tens of millions of years, but more likely a recent immigrant arriving during a dispersal wave, probably from North-Africa. They admitted this was at odds with their own phylogenetic analysis, showing Scipionyx to be a basal compsognathid, but they pointed out that the phylogeny found was uncertain due to the juvenile status of the fossil. Land animals actually found in the Pietraroja deposits are all small. They include the lizards Chometokadmon and Eichstaettisaurus gouldi, a relative of the forty million years older German Eichstaettisaurus schroederi; the rhynchocephalian Derasmosaurus and the amphibian Celtedens megacephalus. Food The fossil provides direct information about the diet of Scipionyx because remains of a complete series of consecutive meals have been preserved, perhaps everything the animal ate during its short life. These confirm what already could be concluded from its phylogenetic affinities and general build: that Scipionyx was a predator. In the oesophagus tract about eight scales and some bone fragments are present. Dal Sasso & Maganuco considered it likely that these had not been swallowed as loose elements but were the remains of a meal, partly regurgitated from the stomach in the final death throes. In the stomach position itself, a cluster of small bones is visible. These include an ankle with a three millimetre wide metatarsus consisting of five metatarsals attached, a tail vertebra and the upper end of an ulna. If the remains represent a single prey animal, it is likely either a member of the Mesoeucrocodylia or some lepidosaurian lizard-like animal; the size indicates the last possibility. In the descending tract of the duodenum two clusters of lizard scales are present and, more below, a fish vertebra. The jejunum shows a cluster of dozens of fish vertebrae, likely having belonged to a member of the Clupeomorpha. A second cluster of vertebrae was found at the jejunum-ileum boundary. The final tract of the rectum still holds faeces in which a piece of skin is visible showing seventeen scales of a fish of the Osteoglossiformes that was nine seasons old, judging from the growth lines on the scales. The food items found allow to reconstruct a sequence of food intakes: first a four to five centimetres long fish; secondly a smaller fish of two to three centimetres; next a ten to twelve centimetres long lizard; then a fifteen to forty, depending on the identification, centimetres long lepidosaurian lizard; and finally some indeterminate vertebrate(s). Together they represent a varied diet showing that Scipionyx was an opportunistic generalist. That swift lizards had been caught and sea fish washed ashore had been gathered necessitating a prolonged patrolling of the flood line, both indicate a good mobility. If the prey animal in the stomach really was forty centimetres long, it is highly unlikely that the equally-sized hatchling had been able to subdue it, indicating parental care. Physiology Scipionyx is considered one of the most important fossil vertebrates ever discovered, after a long and painstaking \\"autopsy\\" revealed the unique fossilisation of portions of its internal organs. It is believed Scipionyx lived in a region filled with shallow lagoons. These bodies of water were oxygen deficient, leading to the well-preserved Scipionyx specimen, much like the fine fossil preservation seen in Germany's Archaeopteryx.Reisdorf, A.G., and Wuttke, M. (2012). \\"Re- evaluating Moodie's Opisthotonic-Posture Hypothesis in fossil vertebrates. Part I: Reptiles - The taphonomy of the bipedal dinosaurs Compsognathus longipes and Juravenator starki from the Solnhofen Archipelago (Jurassic, Germany).\\" Palaeobiodiversity and Palaeoenvironments, Parts of the windpipe, intestines, liver, blood vessels, cartilage, horn sheaths, tendons and muscles were fossilised in the fine limestone. The specimen's liver was preserved in the form of a red hematite halo retaining the shape it had when the animal was alive. The find has great importance because the relative positions of internal organs of dinosaurs could only be guessed at before this discovery. The holotype specimen thus provides unique direct information about the physiology of non-avian dinosaurs, especially regarding the digestion, the respiration and the ontogenesis. =Digestion= The digestive tract of Scipionyx is generally short but wide. The overall length of the intestines -- shorter than what was expected -- indicates Scipionyx could process food very efficiently. The efficiency would be improved by the visible intestine folds, the plicae circulares, enlarging the absorption surface. Dal Sasso & Maganuco emphasised that a short tract does not necessarily imply that the processing time was short too; retention could have been prolonged to optimise digestion. Most extant vertebrate predators are capable of extracting about 75% of the energetic value of the prey flesh. The bones in the stomach region had not been etched by the stomach acid, indicating this meal was less than a day old. It is possible that the stomach exit was too narrow to let these remains pass and that the acid was used to extract calcium from the bones, a much-needed nutrient for a young growing animal. The subsequent digestive tract with most extant vertebrates is incapable of further digesting bones. Afterwards the remains would then have been regurgitated. However, the presence of vertebrae in the intestines suggests that the exit was wide and that non-avian theropods in this respect were more like present Lepidosauromorpha than extant Archosauria who regurgitate. This is also confirmed by a high bone content in the coprolites of large theropods. Fish contains much calcium and it is possible that the hatchling instinctively sought it out; alternatively, it could have been preferentially fed fish by its parents. The presence of skin in the faeces was to be expected as this is not easily digested. The body parts of the large lepidosaurian in the stomach had been made more digestible by biting them into pieces. According to Dal Sasso & Maganuco the hatchling would certainly have been incapable of achieving this and they considered it a strong indication of parental care as it was improbable the animal had by chance encountered a carcass neatly ripped apart into easily swallowed bits by predators or scavengers. =Respiration= Although most of the respiratory system has not been preserved, some far-reaching conclusions have been drawn from the indirect evidence available. In 1999 John Ruben e.a. inferred that Scipionyx had a respiratory system different from birds, and more similar to crocodiles, based on an analysis of pictures of the fossil which seemed to indicate the presence of a diaphragm. The large liver would have completely divided the body cavity into an anterior section for the heart and lungs and a posterior section for the intestines. This would have indicated the presence of septate lungs, ventilated by a hepatic-piston diaphragm, driven by the liver and a Musculus diaphragmaticus, which in the fossil was visibly attached to the pubes. Such a system would be an argument against the idea that birds, whose lungs are ventilated by air-sacs, are coelurosaurian theropods, and an indication theropods were cold-blooded. John Ruben's conclusions have, however, been questioned by some scientists, such as Lawrence Witmer, who claimed the study to be flawed. The 2011 study concluded that due to the fact that the liver had been preserved as a vague halo, representing body fluids that after death might have covered a larger surface than the organs they originated from, its exact dimensions and extent cannot be determined. In any case a diaphragm itself or its position could not be directly observed. Many bird livers are large too, showing that such a trait is compatible with an air-sac system. The small body cavity in front of the halo seemed to indicate the presence of small stiff bird-like lungs. The presumed M. diaphragmaticus was shown to be an artifact caused by the polishing and engraving of calcite nodules of non-organic origin during preparation, creating the illusion of muscle fibres. The empty space between the pubic bones and the intestines has by G.S. Paul and David Martill been hypothesised to have been the location of a large air-sac. Dal Sasso & Maganuco however, rejected this interpretation because with living birds the air-sac of the posterior abdomen does not force the intestines forwards. They considered the space more likely to have been filled by a large yolk-sac. Air-sacs were nevertheless probable given the pneumatisation of the vertebrae. Vertebrae without pneumatopores would have indicated the boundaries between three air-sac systems: those of the neck base, the lungs, and the abdomen. The double rib heads would indicate a rather stiff thorax, ventilated by the gastralia. A system of hook-like uncinate processes on the ribs as with the Maniraptoriformes, allowing the ribcage to move flexibly, in articulation with an ossified sternum, was absent in Scipionyx. =Growth= The holotype of Scipionyx is a rare example of a non-avian theropod hatchling; the most important other very young specimens are the chicks of Byronosaurus that however are much less complete. The young age is reflected by the proportions and the low degree of ossification and fusion of several skeletal elements. The most obvious youthful trait is the relatively large and short head. Dal Sasso & Maganuco have tried to determine the absolute age of the hatchling. The fact that the fontanelle had not closed yet, poses an upper age limit of about five weeks. An even lower limit is indicated by the lack of any tooth replacement, which with Archosauria begins after a few weeks at the latest. The most exact age is given by the size of the yolk sac, which indicates a probable age of three days, with an upper limit of a week. Despite its very young age, the hatchling was able to walk, as is shown by the complete ossification of the ilium. However, this does not imply Scipionyx was precocial as even with altricial birds this pelvis bone fully ossifies within a few days after hatching.

Playing career The Knoxville, Tennessee native posted a 27‚Äì20 record with 181 strikeouts and a 3.84 earned run average in 519 innings pitched. He posted an 18‚Äì8 mark as a Cardinals rookie in 1945, with 22 starts and 20 relief appearances; his 18 victories and .692 winning percentage each tied him for third in the National League, while his 2.90 ERA ranked him seventh, but an ailing throwing arm ended his season prematurely, and he increasingly worked from the bullpen afterwards. As a pitcher, since he lacked a speedy fastball, he relied on an \\"oddly breaking knuckleball\\" The Sporting News. October 23, 1946 for much of his success. On July 26, , Burkhart was traded by St. Louis to the Reds in exchange for first baseman Babe Young. He appeared in 11 games for the Reds in 1949 and retired at the end of the season. Umpiring career Following his playing career, Burkhart developed as a well-regarded umpire. He worked in three World Series (1962, 1964 and 1970), serving as crew chief in 1970, and in the 1972 National League Championship Series. He umpired in four All-Star Games (second 1959 game, second 1962 game, 1967 and 1973), and also umpired in no-hitters on consecutive days in for Gaylord Perry (September 17) and Ray Washburn (September 18).Coberly, p. 143. On May 11, he was umpiring at second base when Sandy Koufax pitched his second no- hitter,Coberly, p. 122. and on June 21, he was at third base when Jim Bunning of the Philadelphia Phillies pitched a 6‚Äì0 perfect game against the New York Mets.Coberly, p. 127. Burkhart officiated in eight no-hitters overall, then one short of the record for NL umpires, but did not work behind the plate for any of them. He was, however, behind the plate on July 12, when brothers Tommie and Hank Aaron both hit home runs in the ninth inning to propel the Milwaukee Braves to an 8‚Äì6 win, with Hank's grand slam winning the contest. Notable games Burkhart was involved in the most controversial play of the 1970 World Series when the Cincinnati Reds were batting against the Baltimore Orioles with one out and the score tied at three in the sixth inning of Game 1. With runners Tommy Helms at first base and Bernie Carbo at third, pinch hitter Ty Cline hit a Baltimore chop off Jim Palmer who, while running towards home plate, immediately signaled to catcher Elrod Hendricks that Carbo was trying to score from third. Hendricks fielded the ball barehanded, spun around to his left and lunged at an oncoming Carbo in an attempt to tag him out, but collided with Burkhart who, while positioning himself to judge whether the batted ball was fair, accidentally blocked the runner's path to the plate. Carbo slid around Burkhart on the outside but missed touching home plate. With his back to the play and after being knocked down, Burkhart ruled Carbo out even though Hendricks made the tag with his mitt while holding the ball in his bare hand.Durso, Joseph. \\"Umpire Disputed,\\" The New York Times, Sunday, October 11, 1970.

Education  He was born in Stockton-on-Tees, brought up in Norton-on-Tees, and educated at Stockton Grammar School, Stockton-Billingham Technical College, and the College of St Mark and St John, Chelsea.  Political career  Between 1974 and 1981, Wrigglesworth was Labour Member of Parliament for Thornaby on Teesside. He was one of the founder members of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981 and was subsequently elected SDP Member for Stockton South from 1983 until 1987, when he lost his seat. In 1988, he became the first president of the Liberal Democrats and was chairman of the Liberal Democrat Trustees until February 2012, when he became national treasurer. Shortly after he was elected to Parliament, Wrigglesworth was a founder member of the Manifesto Group and with John Cartwright helped found the Campaign for Labour Victory under the leadership of Bill Rodgers. From 1974 to 1979, he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Home Secretary, the Rt Hon Roy Jenkins, and when Labour returned to Opposition in 1979, he was appointed Shadow Minister for the Civil Service by the Rt Hon James Callaghan. However, Wrigglesworth became increasingly disillusioned by the leftward direction the Labour Party was taking and became part of the nucleus of Labour MPs who contemplated leaving the party in 1979 and 1980. In 1981, Wrigglesworth became one of the founding members of the SDP and with Mike Thomas organised the launch of the new party in March 1981. Wrigglesworth was one of only six SDP Members of Parliament to be returned to the House of Commons in the 1983 general election when he narrowly won the newly created constituency of Stockton South by 102 votes. In the 1987 general election, he was narrowly defeated by the Conservative candidate, Tim Devlin, by 774 votes. After the merger of SDP and the Liberals, Wrigglesworth was elected the first president of the new Social and Liberal Democrats in 1988 and served a tumultuous two-year term as president, where he helped to guide the new party through a financial crisis, its disastrous showing in the 1989 European Parliamentary election and its change in name to the Liberal Democrats. Wrigglesworth was knighted in 1991 and, although he has been active in the business community in the North East since that time, he has retained his involvement with the Liberal Democrats. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music by the University of Northumbria in December 2011 and an Honorary Doctorate of Business Administration by the University of Teesside in October 2012. At the Liberal Democrat Spring Conference 2012, held at The Sage Gateshead, it was announced that Sir Ian had taken up the post of treasurer of the party, which he held until December 2015.  Peerage  It was announced that he would be elevated to the House of Lords in August 2013Working Peerages announced Gov.uk and on 5 September 2013, he was created a life peer, as Baron Wrigglesworth, of Norton-on-Tees in the County of Durham.  Memberships  Until February 2012, Wrigglesworth was deputy chairman of the Government's Regional Growth Fund Advisory Panel, which is chaired by Lord Heseltine and appointed by the government to consider bids. He is chief executive of a Gateshead-based company and was chairman of the Port of Tyne until August 2012. From 1995 to January 2009, he was the executive chairman of UK Land Estates and prior to that was executive deputy chairman of the Teesside-based Livingston Group and an executive director of its associate company Fairfield Industries. From 1996 until 2000, he was chairman of the public policy company, Prima Europe, and then chairman of its successor, GPC, after Prima was acquired by Omnicom. He has also been a non-executive director of a number of other private and public companies. He was founder chairman of the NewcastleGateshead Initiative, the private/public sector partnership responsible for the destination marketing of Newcastle and Gateshead and its bid for European Capital of Culture 2008, which was won by Liverpool. From 2005 to 2009, he was the chairman of the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead. Under his chairmanship the finances were restructured and the present caterers were appointed. His role was criticised for appointing controversial director Peter Doroshenko and stating that staff unrest against the director was a \\"storm in a teacup\\". A number of controversial exhibitions took place at that time. After Doroshenko's departure he was then responsible for the appointment of the current director, Godfrey Wordsdale, and discussions with the University of Northumbria were begun which led to the current partnership between the two institutions. Prior to becoming a Member of Parliament, he worked in the City at National Giro Bank and began his working life in Middlesbrough at the Midland Bank. He is a former chairman of the Northern Region CBI and was founder chairman of the Northern Business Forum. Until 2002, he was deputy chairman of the governors of the University of Teesside (formerly Middlesbrough Polytechnic). Personal life He is married to Tricia, who is a health visitor, and has two sons and a daughter. References *One Northumberland Many Communities - Biographies...

Early life  Fayolle studied at the √âcole polytechnique from 1873, where he graduated with the class of 1875 and was commissioned into the artillery.https://www.polytechnique.edu/bibliotheque/fr/fayolle-emile-x1873-0  Military career  During his career he served in the artillery. He participated in the Pacification of Tunisia in 1881. Promoted to Captain he entered the √©cole de Guerre in 1889 and graduated with distinction in 1891. From 1897 to 1908 he taught artillery at the √âcole sup√©rieure de Guerre. He retired in 1914 with the rank of Brigadier General. With the outbreak of the First World War, Fayolle was recalled from retirement by the French commander- in-chief Joseph Joffre and given command of the 70th Infantry Division. Fayolle took part in the fighting near Nancy, notably the Battle of Grand Couronn√©, which helped make possible the French victory at the First Battle of the Marne. Later, Philippe P√©tain took command of the Corps in which Fayolle was serving, and the two commanders became close. In May, 1915 Fayolle succeeded P√©tain in command of the 33rd Corps. In this command he participated in the Artois Offensive. In 1916, Fayolle was given command of the Sixth Army, which he commanded at the battle of the Somme, under the command of Ferdinand Foch's Northern Army Group. In preparation for the Somme offensive, the French Sixth Army under Fayolle would attack with 8 divisions, a force reduced from the original 40 divisions because of the French needs at Verdun. During the offensive, Fayolle is credited with successfully using a combination of artillery resources and infantry tactics to push the less well-defended Germans back across an 8-mile long segment of his front. In August, as the Battle of the Somme continued, General Foch, commander of French forces on the Somme, visited British General Haig at Val Vion. Foch appointed Fayolle, one of the most successful army commanders of July, to fight alongside the British forces between their right flank and the north bank of the River Somme. During the British and French Somme offensive from August 1 to September 12, Fayolle decided without consulting the high command that his troops were too exhausted to launch a major offensive. He then reduced his command's participation in the battle to 1 division. The British had lost significant French support on their right during the offensive. In October, French forces led by Fayolle advanced almost to Sailly Saillisol by successfully using the artillery- barrage system. On 31 December 1916, Fayolle was transferred to command the First Army. When Philippe P√©tain was appointed Chief of the General Staff in April 1917, Fayolle was put in command of the Army Group Center, to the disappointment of Foch, who had hoped for the command himself; P√©tain replaced Nivelle as Commander-in-Chief in May 1917. On 16 November 1917, after the Italians met disaster at Caporetto, Fayolle was transferred to Italy with six divisions and made commander in chief of the French troops supporting the Italians. Marshal Fayolle awards the flag of the Canadian Royal 22nd Regiment on the Plains of Abraham in Quebec City, Canada. Fayolle had been sent to Canada on a gratitude mission for Canada's assistance during the First World War. Fayolle stayed in Italy until March 1918, when he was recalled to France and put at the head of the 55 division strong Army Group Reserve, with which he played a role in stopping the last significant German offensives. After the allied victory in the Second Battle of the Marne, he took part in the allied counteroffensive until the end of the war. From July until November Fayolle's command reduced the Marne Salient and drove towards the Rhine. He commanded occupation forces in the Palatinat and Rheinhessen and was a member of the allied Control Commission. Fayolle was named in 1920 a member of the French Conseil Sup√©rieur de la Guerre, the highest French military council. The next year, 1921, he was made Marshal of France. Fayolle undertook diplomatic missions to Canada and Italy.  Legacy  He also has a statue in front of the Les Invalides. Fayolle kept a diary during the war, not published until 1966, it provides deep insight into French strategic thinking at the time.

On 3 October 1984 Macartney-Snape and Greg Mortimer were the first Australians to reach the summit of Mount Everest. They reached the summit, climbing without supplementary oxygen, via a new route on the North Face (North Face to Norton Couloir). In 1990, Macartney-Snape became the first person to walk and climb from sea level to the top of Mount Everest. Macartney-Snape is also the co- founder of the Sea to Summit range of outdoor and adventure gear and accessories,http://www.saxton.com.au/default.asp?sd8=113 a guide for adventure travel company World Expeditionswww.worldexpeditions.com and a founding director and patron of the World Transformation Movement. Early years He was born in Tanganyika Territory (now Tanzania), where he lived on a farm with his Australian father and Irish mother. In 1967, the family moved to Australia to a farm in north eastern Victoria.Macartney-Snape, Tim, Being Outside, Australian Geographic 1993. . He attended Geelong Grammar School and spent a year at the school's outdoor education campus Timbertop.Find me a mountain: Timbertop and the Victorian high country Simon Leslie, Stuart Walker and Tim Macartney-Snape. 1993 Geelong Grammar School Macartney-Snape studied at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra where he joined the ANU Mountaineering Club (ANUMC) and obtained a BSc. Mountaineering=Australia and New Zealand Having rock-climbed all over Australia, his first mountaineering experience was two seasons in New Zealand's Southern Alps. Dunagiri In 1978, Macartney-Snape travelled to India as part of the ANUMC's expedition to Dunagiri (7,066 m). After prolonged bad weather he and Lincoln Hall radioed to the Expedition Leader, Peter Cocker, that they wanted to make another attempt on East Dunagiri. Cocker, who was alone at the time at Col Camp on Dunagiri, invited them instead to make a final attempt on Dunagiri. If they could force through a route to the Summit Ridge, they could then return to Col Camp and wait for support to make the summit attempt. Maccartney-Snape and Hall agreed, returned to Dunagiri, and then pushed through to the Summit Ridge. The weather cleared, and after they spent a clear but very cold night out without sleeping bags, Macartney-Snape and Hall made an audacious attempt for the summit of Dunagiri. They were successful and the pair then descended through an electrical storm. Maccartney-Snape reached Col Camp at 10.30 p.m.; however, Hall spent another night out on the mountain. During the night, Cocker ascended the fixed ropes to meet him and accompany him back to Col Camp. This was the first major Himalayan summit climbed by an Australian. Ama Dablam In 1981, Macartney-Snape climbed Ama Dablam (6812m) via the north ridge with a small lightweight team. Macartney-Snape reportedly cited this climb as the inspiration for later climbing Everest: \\"partway up the North ridge of Ama Dablam he looked over and could see Mt Everest and wondered what it might be like to experience the highest point of the world via a new route in good style\\".Alpinist magazine Issue 27 Annapurna II In 1983, Macartney-Snape planned and participated in an expedition to Annapurna II (7,937 m) successfully reaching the summit via the first ascent of the south spur. The descent was delayed by a blizzard and the expedition ran out of food during the last five days. They were reported missing and when the expedition eventually returned they received significant publicity.Hall, Lincoln, White limbo: The first Australian Climb of Mt. Everest Random House Australia 1985 Mount Everest In July 1984, a small Australian team headed to the north side of Mt Everest where they prepared and ascended an unclimbed route on the north face, climbing without bottled oxygen in a lightweight alpine style and without the help of high altitude porters. On 3 October 1984, climbing in cross-country ski boots as substitutes for his high altitude climbing boots that had been lost in an earlier avalanche, Macartney-Snape and Greg Mortimer became the first Australians to climb Mt Everest, an achievement for which they were both awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for service to mountaineering. Mt Everest historian, Walt Unsworth, described it as \\"one of the greatest climbs ever done on the mountain\\"Unsworth, Walt, Everest: the Mountaineering History 3rd Ed, Mountaineers Books 2000 and American climber, John Roskelley, said, \\"the Aussies pulled off the coup of the century\\". The expedition was sponsored by Channel 9 who produced a television documentary about the expedition.Everest: The Australian Challenge: The First Australian Mt Everest Expedition's ascent of the great Couloir Route Autumn 1984 Channel 9. 1984. Gasherbrum IV ‚Äì second ascent / first ascent of northwest ridge In 1986 fellow Australian Greg Child was organising an international team to attempt Gasherbrum IV (7980m). The mountain's first and only ascent had been in 1957 by an elite team of Italian alpinists, as its sheer faces and rocky ridges had since thwarted many attempts. The climb up the previously-unclimbed north west ridge proved difficult; it was one \\"that challenged even Macartney-Snape‚Äôs legendary strength and endurance at high altitude.\\" Macartney-Snape took a film movie camera on the climb, as he had done on Everest, and the subsequent film, was given the title Harder than Everest.Film Australia 1987 After a night without sleeping bags or stove at just under 8000m Child, Macartney-Snape and American Tom Hargis had finally made the coveted second ascent of Gasherbrum IV.Child, Greg, Thin Air: Encounters in the Himalaya Mountaineers Books, Seattle, WA, USA. 1988 , Everest: Sea to Summit Expedition In 1990, Macartney-Snape returned once again to Mt Everest with the idea of climbing the mountain from the sea to the summit. The idea had originally been floated by adventure cameraman, Michael Dillon. With sponsorship provided by Australian Geographic, amongst others, it would take Macartney-Snape three months to achieve this goal. This was the first time anyone had walked from sea level and reached the top of Mt Everest, as even the first expeditions started from Kathmandu, at 1400m above sea level. While planning the expedition, Macartney-Snape and his then wife, Dr Ann Ward, were living in Meekatharra, Western Australia where she was stationed with the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Macartney-Snape trained for the upcoming expedition with demanding runs in the 40-degree heat of the surrounding bush and short, solo climbs on the large boulders around Meekatharra. The 500 vertical metres from the Bay of Bengal involved a 1200 km walk from the sea, leaving Ganga Sagar on 5 February 1990, walking through India to the Nepalese border. He was joined by Ward, his sister Pip, film- maker Mike Dillon, Nepali cook Tenzing Sherpa and Charles Norwood, who drove a Land Rover with gear for the trek. Macartney-Snape planned to avoid three large expeditions attempting the South Col route, by climbing Everest via the more difficult West Ridge, then traversing to descend the standard South Col route. He reached nearly 7500m on acclimatisation sorties, but bad weather and a strong avalanche risk changed Macartney-Snape's plans to ascend via the South Col route. After two preparatory trips through the Khumbu Icefall to the Western Cwm, he left his team on 7 May to attempt the summit solo and without supplemental oxygen, carrying a pack with a tent, food, fuel and a movie camera to the South Col at 8000m. Light-headed and plagued by bouts of diarrhoea following the challenging solo climb up the Lhotse Face, Macartney- Snape rested a day before setting out for the summit of Everest at 9.30pm on 10 May in bright moonlight. Climbing solo, weak with nausea and diarrhea and having eaten little in the previous days, it took nearly six hours in cold for him to ascend from 8,230 m and 8,536 m, nearly falling to his death at midnight when stopping to adjust the movie camera he carried. Then he climbed the South-East Ridge from the South Summit to the true summit. He achieved his second ascent of Everest at about 9.45 am on 11 May, the first to climb from sea to summit. On the summit he unfurled the flag of the Australian Geographic Society, his sponsor, and that of the Foundation for Humanity's Adulthood (now named the World Transformation Movement). In 1993 he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for service to mountaineering and to international relations. Mt Sarmiento In 1995 Macartney-Snape, Stephen Venables, John Roskelley, Jim Wickwire and Charlie Porter attempted a new route on Mt Sarmiento, on the western shores of Tierra del Fuego, where Macartney-Snape, Roskelley and Venables summited via new route up the southwest face of the western summit.Wickwire, Jim and Bullitt, Dorothy, Addicted to Danger Simon & Schuster 1999. Yangma In 2010 Macartney-Snape successfully summited a 6,500m unclimbed peak in remote Eastern Nepal with a team that included four members of the ANUMC Himalayan Expedition of 1978 to Dunagiri. Association with Jeremy Griffith and the World Transformation Movement Macartney-Snape is a founding director and patron of the World Transformation Movement (WTM), formerly known as the Foundation for Humanity's Adulthood (FHA), an organisation dedicated to understanding and ameliorating the human condition. In particular the World Transformation Movement supports the work of Australian biologist Jeremy Griffith. In 1987 the Australian Geographic Society, founded by businessman Dick Smith, arranged a function at which Macartney-Snape made a speech. Griffith attended the function and met with Macartney-Snape. Several months later they met again where Griffith discussed his ideas with Macartney-Snape and gave him a draft copy of his first book Free: The End of the Human Condition. Macartney-Snape said that the explanation given in the book for human nature \\"made total sense\\". Macartney- Snape subsequently became involved in the World Transformation Movement and in 1990 on Everest's summit filmed himself saying \\"It is time to climb the mountains of the mind\\". When Griffith published Beyond the Human Condition in 1991 it featured a foreword written by Macartney-Snape.Griffith, Jeremy, Beyond the Human Condition WTM Publishing 1990 . Defamation case In 1995 an Australian Broadcasting Corporation Four Corners program was broadcast and a feature article was published in The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper concerning Macartney-Snape, Griffith and the World Transformation Movement. In 2003 and 2005 respectively the publications were found by NSW Supreme Court juries to be defamatory of Macartney-Snape, Griffith and the World Transformation Movement. In 2008 Macartney-Snape was awarded almost $500,000 plus costs for the loss and damage caused by the broadcast, with the total payout expected to exceed $1 million. Macartney-Snape said \\"Thirteen years later the truth has caught up with the lie\\".The Australian newspaper article 1 August 2008 In 2009 The Sydney Morning Herald published an apology for the harm caused by the article.The Sydney Morning Herald 6 June 2009 Awards * Keys to the City of Sydney * Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) (1987).

Opened on Feb 24, 1974, it is one of the longest continuing operations of New Orleans' music clubs with live performances seven nights a week. On the first night Andrew Hall's Society Jazz Band played and were there every Saturday for seven years. Many of the old time musicians were featured, including members of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. The Society Jazz Band left in the summer of 1981 but have played there several times since then, including the 30th birthday party in 2004 and the 40th birthday party in 2014. Musical styles represented include blues, funk, R&B;, rock, zydeco, jazz, jam bands. Frequent performers have included James Booker, Rebirth Brass Band, Clarence \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown, Henry Butler, Walter \\"Wolfman\\" Washington, Papa Grows Funk, and The Radiators. The bar has been an incubator for young bands formed by students at Tulane University, Loyola University, and the University of New Orleans. In recent history, the bar has weekly hosted residencies from acts such as Tank and the Bangas, The Revivalists, George Porter Jr., Jon Cleary (musician) and Johnny Vidacovich. Porter still holds a weekly, Monday night residency at the bar with his trio, featuring Terrence Houston, and Michael \\"Goldenthroat\\" Lemmler. Poet Everette Maddox was so closely tied to the venue that his ashes are buried in the bar's patio area. The Maple Leaf hosts poetry readings and fashion shows. The Krewe of OAK starts and ends its parades at the Maple Leaf, where it holds its Krewe Ball. The Maple Leaf is thinly disguised in the Ellen Gilchrist short story \\"The Raintree Street Bar and Washerteria\\" (the bar used to contain a laundromat). Poems about it can be found in Mirror Wars and Shards by Nancy Harris, Body and Soul and Rhythm & Booze by Julie Kane; The Everette Maddox Song Book, Bar Scotch, and American Waste by Everette Maddox; and in the anthologies The Maple Leaf Rag (1980), The Maple Leaf Rag 15th Anniversary Anthology (1994), and Maple Leaf Rag III (2006). Hurricane Katrina The Maple Leaf was closed for several weeks in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Owner Hank Staples remained in New Orleans to guard the bar and his other properties while vowing in interviews with to host the first concert in New Orleans after the storm. On September 30, 2005, Walter \\"Wolfman\\" Washington played the Maple Leaf's first post-Katrina show in New Orleans. (Some other local musicians who were playing in the aftermath of the storm dispute the claim that it was the city's first post-Katrina public performance, but this was the first to generate such sizable crowds and media attention.) That night many of the journalists, cameramen, and crew from NBC News and other media outlets joined the party and recorded the event. The band's equipment was powered by a diesel generator because electricity had not yet been restored to most of the city. The concert was shut down by police and National Guard because the city was under a curfew. Electricity was restored to this section of the city about a week later.

In 1993, Somchai Traimwichanon found a partial skeleton of a large theropod at the Phu Wiang 9 site in Khon Kaen. In 1996, Eric Buffetaut, Varavudh Suteethorn and Haiyan Tong named and described the type species Siamotyrannus isanensis. The generic name is derived from the old Thai kingdom of Siam, and a Latinised Greek tyrannus, meaning \\"tyrant\\", in reference to a presumed membership of the Tyrannosauridae. The specific name is derived from Thai isan, \\"northeastern part\\", referring to the provenance from northeast Thailand. The holotype, PW9-1, was found in the Sao Khua Formation, dating from the Berriasian- Barremian. It includes the left half of the pelvis, five rear dorsal vertebrae, the sacrum with five sacrals, and thirteen front tail vertebrae. In 1998, a tibia and some individual teeth were referred to the species.Buffetaut, E. and Suteethorn, V., 1998, \\"Early Cretaceous dinosaurs from Thailand and their bearing on the early evolution and biogeographical history of some groups of Cretaceous dinosaurs\\", In: Lucas, Kirkland and Estep, (eds.). Lower and Middle Cretaceous Terrestrial Ecosystems. New Mexico Museum of Natural History Bulletin 14. p. 205-210 Siamotyrannus is a large theropod. Buffetaut estimated its length at seven meters. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated the length at 6 meters (20 ft) , the weight at 500 kg.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 91 In 2016 Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi gave a higher estimation of 10 meters (33 ft) and 1.75 tonnes (1.93 short tons). A possible autapomorphy, unique derived trait, is the possession of two vertical ridges on the ilium. The second and third sacrals are strongly transversely flattened. As evidenced by its name, it was originally thought to be a tyrannosauroid and even a tyrannosaurid, though due to lacking some of the primary tyrannosauroid synapomorphies that define the clade, its position here is not certain.Rauhut, Oliver W.

It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between to the west and, to the east, on the Southend Line and on the Crouch Valley Line. The Engineer's Line Reference for the line is SSV, the station's three-letter station code is WIC. The vast majority of services on both lines connect to the Great Eastern Main Line at for Liverpool Street. Wickford station and all trains serving it are currently operated by Greater Anglia. The station was previously called Wickford Junction when the Crouch Valley route to also included a branch to and more agricultural traffic passed through the station.  Description  The line from Shenfield to Wickford and the station were opened for goods on 19 November 1888 and for passengers on 1 January 1889 by the Great Eastern Railway.Branch Line to Southminster by Denis L Swindale . Wickford station comprises two main line platforms (platform 2 for eastbound services and 3 for westbound services towards London), both with an operational length of 12 carriages, and two eastern-facing branch line bay platforms (number 1 is used for trains from Southminster and number 4, which is very rarely used) at the eastern end of the station, each with an operational length of 5 carriages. At the London end of the station there once was a goods yard and turntable for steam locomotives, closed in 1954; a couple of sidings remain here for storing engineering vehicles or failed trains, but much of the railway land here is now in use as a car park for passengers. The line from Wickford to Southend Victoria was converted from semaphore signalling to 3-aspect, automatic and semi-automatic, colour light signals on 26 June 1938.Notice: Colour light signalling between Wickford and Southend. London and North Eastern Railway (1938). Published by Great Eastern Railways Society (2003) At the same time the signal boxes at Fanton, Rayleigh, Hockley and Rochford were decommissioned. The Shenfield to Southend Victoria line was electrified using 1.5 kV DC overhead line electrification (OLE) on 31 December 1956. This was changed to 6.25 kV AC in November 1960 and to 25 kV AC on 25 January 1979. Platforms 1 and 4 were electrified when the Southminster branch was electrified on 12 May 1986. The signal box that was formerly located at the end of platforms 3 and 4, before the bridge crossing Wickford High Street, was demolished in the early 1990s following the introduction of new signalling controlled from Liverpool Street. The upper floor of the original Great Eastern Railway station buildings on platforms 1 and 2 were destroyed by fire in the late 1990s, however, the ground floor (including the ticket office, waiting room and staff accommodation) was saved and remains in use. Accidents and incidents *On 24 February 1965, the 10:18 departure from for derailed upon departure from Wickford when a set of points was moved while the train passed over them, causing the rear coaches to be diverted onto the branch line and be derailed. The incident caused damage to the infrastructure and carriages, and minor injury to two passengers on board the train.http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/MoT_Wickford1965.pdf *On 31 January 1971, a collision occurred between a newspaper delivery train and the 04:04 passenger service from Southend Victoria, bound for Liverpool Street. Nobody was injured, however two carriages of the passenger train were extensively damaged and some minor damage was caused to the newspaper train. The newspaper train's driver had left his cab to check signals without having applied the brakes, leading to the train slipping back down the gradient of the Southminster branch line, into the Southend train which was stopped on the main line at Wickford.http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/DoE_Wickford1970.pdf  Services  All services at Wickford are operated by Greater Anglia. The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is: * 3 tph to London Liverpool Street * 3 tph to * 1 train every 40 minutes to Additional services operate during the peak hours. On Sundays, services between London and Southend are reduced to 2 tph and services to Southminster reduced to hourly.  References  Branch Line to Southminster by Denis L Swindale .

Ferdinando was heir to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, with the title Grand Prince, from his father's accession in 1670 until his death in 1713. He is remembered today primarily as a patron of music. An excellent musician himself (sometimes called \\"the Orpheus of princes\\"), he attracted top musicians to Florence and thus made it an important musical center.http://www.quadroframe.com/html/albums/fr9829_en.html#contents Through his patronage of Bartolomeo Cristofori, Ferdinando made possible the invention of the piano. Life Ferdinando was born in the Palazzo Pitti to Cosimo III de' Medici and his wife Marguerite Louise d'Orl√©ans, a granddaughter of Maria de' Medici. When Ferdinando's parents separated in 1675, his mother (who disdained her husband only slightly more than Florence did) returned to Paris, where she was supposed to be confined to a monastery in Montmartre. Ferdinando became a rebellious youth, who disagreed intensely with his father on every subject.Acton, H. (1958) The Last Medici, p. 160. He was placed under the care of his grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere. Ferdinando had a great affinity with his vivacious mother. He was handsome, a fine horseman, and a talented musician. He sang melodiously and played the harpsichord. He was a master in counterpoint, which he studied under Gianmaria Paliardi of Genoa, and in various bowed instruments, which he studied under Piero Salvetti. He was known for his ability to play a piece of music at sightWebsite in Italian and English and then repeat it faultlessly without looking at the music.Acton, H. (1958) The Last Medici, p. 164. Aside from music, Ferdinando's other principal delight was in intimate liaisons and affairs, often with men. These included Petrillo, a musician famous for his beauty, and Cecchino, a Venetian castrato. Ferdinando's uncle Francesco Maria de' Medici, only three years older, was a strong influence on his life. Anton Domenico Gabbiani, Prince Ferdinand and his musicians, 1685-90, Florence, Palatine Gallery of Palazzo Pitti In 1689 Ferdinando married Violante of Bavaria, the daughter of the elector of Bavaria Ferdinand and Adelaide of Savoy. Although she also liked music and loved Ferdinando, her feelings were not requited and the marriage was unhappy and barren. In 1696 Ferdinando sought recreation in Venice. He fell in love with a female vocalist called La Bambagia.Acton, H. (1958) The Last Medici, p. 210. It is presumed that during the Carnival of Venice, Ferdinando contracted syphilis. Victoria Tarquini, called La Bombace, the wife of the concertmaster Jean-Baptiste Farinel became the mistress of Ferdinando. (She may have been a daughter of Robert Cambert and had an affair with Handel.Harris, E.T. (2001) Handel as Orpheus: voice and desire in the chamber cantatas, p. 180.) By 1710 his health had begun to fail, and the annual operatic productions at Pratolino under his aegis (see below) ceased. Ferdinando died in 1713, having fathered no children. His father continued to rule until 1723, and was succeeded on his death by Ferdinando's younger brother Gian Gastone, who likewise died childless. The lack of fecundity in the family ultimately led to a crisis: after Gian Gastone's death in 1737, the great powers of Europe reassigned the Grand Duchy to Francis, the husband of Maria Theresa, thus ending the independence of the Tuscan state. Legacy Ferdinando's contemporary reputation rests on his role as patron of the arts. He was a connoisseur: he bought Madonnas by Raphael and Andrea del Sarto. He also patronised Giuseppe Maria Crespi, Anton Domenico Gabbiani and Sebastiano Ricci. Crespi was long employed by him at Pitti. Ferdinando organised the first public exhibition of fine arts to be held in Florence (1705, in the cloister of SS. Annunziata).Acton, H. (1958) The Last Medici, p. 259. Among poets he befriended Vincenzo da Filicaja and Benedetto Menzini. Scipione Maffei's dedication to him of the Giornale de' Letterati (1710) is a proof of Ferdinando's widespread reputation. Villa at Poggio a Caiano But it was as a patron of music that Ferdinando was most distinguished. He owned the Villa di Pratolino, located some outside Florence, (now called the Villa Demidov after a later owner, Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov, 1st Prince of San Donato) which was home to many musical activities. From the years 1679 to 1710, there were annual operatic productions there, generally held in September. At first these were held in the grand salon, but starting in 1696 in a new theatre built on the third floor at Ferdinando's instigation, designed by Antonio Maria Ferri.Holmes (1994, 23) Until 1686, the performances were supervised by Ferdinando's uncle Francesco Maria de' Medici; after that year (when Francesco Maria became a cardinal) they were Ferdinando's responsibility.Holmes (1994, 24) Among the musicians Ferdinando invited to Florence were Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti, Giacomo Antonio Perti, Giovanni Legrenzi, Giovanni Pagliardi, Carlo Pollaroli, Giuseppe Maria Orlandini, Benedetto Marcello and Bernardo Pasquini.Harris, E.T. (2001) Handel as Orpheus: voice and desire in the chamber cantatas, p. 37. George Frederic Handel and Alessandro Scarlatti probably played on the instruments either in the Palazzo Pitti, or in the Medicean country villa of Poggio a Caiano or at Pratolino. Antonio Salvi, the family doctor, wrote several librettos, used by Handel for his opera.Dean, W. & J.M. Knapp (1996) Handel's Operas 1704‚Äì1726. Clarendon Press Oxford, p. 80. Handel's opera Rodrigo was first performed in Florence in 1708. Ferdinando kept up correspondence with Alessandro Scarlatti about musical details in his operas, while producing five of his operas. In 1711 Antonio Vivaldi dedicated his L'estro Armonico to him. Handel and Corelli were well acquainted with Ferdinando's sister Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici; Corelli dedicated to her the 12 concerti grossi. Handel would visit her also in D√ºsseldorf during continental trips. Ferdinando, Cristofori, and the piano Ferdinando's most permanent legacy was the result of his decision in 1688 to hire Bartolomeo Cristofori, a harpsichord builder from Padua, as his keeper of musical instruments. (Ferdinando's collection was a large one, with over 75 items). The Prince's support of Cristofori included the money and time Cristofori needed to pursue his interests as an inventor. Cristofori responded with a series of new instruments. The first two, the oval spinet (1690) and the spinettone, were probably intended for Ferdinando to play the continuo part in musical productions at Pratolino. The third instrument Cristofori invented for Ferdinando was the piano, which spread slowly at first (see Fortepiano) but ultimately became one of the most important of all musical instruments. The invention of the piano is believed to have occurred in about 1700; Cristofori built several more pianos for Ferdinando during the remainder of the Prince's lifetime.

Stern lives in Jerusalem and, although a wheelchair user, is active in Israel's Messianic Jewish community. Complete Jewish Bible Stern's major work is the Complete Jewish Bible, his English translation of the Tanakh and New Testament (which he, like many Messianic Jews, refers to as the \\"B'rit Hadashah\\", from the Hebrew term ◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ ◊ó◊ì◊©◊î, often translated \\"new covenant\\", used in Jeremiah 31).https://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Jewish-Bible-Testament-Hadashah- ebook/dp/B00513LXYS/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1/253-4894011-6474424 One unique feature of Stern's translation is the wide usage of transliteration, rather than literal translation, throughout the Bible.

Released on June 12, it starred Chaplin as the fireman and Edna Purviance as the daughter to Lloyd Bacon. Plot A beautiful girl's father (Bacon) arranges with the local fire chief (Campbell) to have his house burn down so he can collect the insurance money. In exchange for the chief's complicity in the arson, the father will permit the fire chief to marry his daughter. However, a real fire breaks out elsewhere in the town. The firemen ignore an inhabitant of the burning building as he tries to alert them to the fire, first by activating the fire alarm, then by phoning the fire station, and then by going to the fire station in person. Eventually, a fireman (Chaplin), alerts the fire chief and the company extinguishes the fire. Meanwhile, the father deliberately sets a fire in the basement of his own house without realizing his daughter is still inside the house on the upper floor. Upon knowing his daughter is in mortal danger from the fire, he rushes to find the fire chief to cancel the arrangement not to extinguish his house fire. The fireman (Chaplin), who is also in love with the daughter, abandons the first house fire to rush to the second one. He heroically scales the outside of the building to save her. Reviews A critic for the New York Dramatic Mirror wrote, \\"The Fireman is the second of the Chaplin Mutual comedies, presenting that well-known hero in a whirl of fun and laughter that compares favorably with the best work he has yet done on the screen.\\" A reviewer from the Chicago Tribune was more critical in his appraisal of The Fireman. He wrote, \\"There is more of soup-spilling and Keystone kicking than is necessary for successful slapsticking, but there is also a certain novelty of situation and a jolly humor in its expression that moves to much mirth. Charles Chaplin is a true comedian who doesn't need to resort to the conflict of the physical to make fun. He has a sufficiently mobile expression to do that.\\" Production background scene from film with Edna Purviance The film shows some early morning street scenes in the surrounding Los Angeles area. The film makes use of reversing the film several times for comic effect: sliding up the fireman's pole, reversing the horses, hurrying back to station (in reverse) when he forgets the crew etc. The huge water tank in the station also comically has a second function as the coffee machine. A lot of the kicking in the film is clearly unfaked and fairly violent.

Created by Ozark Softscape and published by Electronic Arts in 1985, it casts the player as an adventurer searching for the Lost Tomb of Pharaoh Ahnk Ahnk in Africa during the late 19th century. Gameplay The game begins with the player having disembarked a steamer north of Cairo in January 1890. The player uses a joystick to move about and choose various game options. The game is played on a screen with a small map in the center and various icons and information surrounding it. Above the map is the current month and year, to the right is information displaying how much food and money the player has, as well as the number of gifts and what is currently in the player's hands. To the left are four icons that allow the player to interact with the game. By pressing the joystick fire button the player can select one of the icons. *The diary icon allows the player to page through the diary to review notes that are automatically written throughout the game, as well as notes of interaction with native chiefs. *The map icon lets the player see how much of the current region has been explored so far. It also provides a map of any city or village the player is currently in - as long as he has bearings there. *The options icon offers the player three choices. The player can check his location, health, or can drop items to create a cache. A cache is marked on the map with an X and the player can return later to retrieve the items. *The hand icon lets the player select and use items from his inventory. Items in hand can affect (among other things) how natives act, how well the player can traverse the terrain and whether the player can find buried treasure. The player obtains items by trading with or buying from the natives. This is accomplished simply by standing next to a native in a hut to learn what he or she will sell or trade. The player then stands over the commodity and buys it. Each city has one merchant who will buy and sell valuable commodities. Native chiefs can tell the player where to find valuables, if they are brought what they want. At various times throughout the game the player can become delirious. When this happens the joystick controls will respond in a random manner until the delirium has passed. To save a game the player must go into a pub in a port city. Up to ten games can be saved on a formatted disk. The game is won when the player finds the Lost Tomb of Pharaoh Ahnk Ahnk. A splash screen is shown and special music is played. The tomb is in a different (randomly generated) spot for each game. Reception Computer Gaming World in 1986 called the game \\"something which none of the participants will soon forget\\". It praised the graphics and ability to complete quests not related to the main story.

The primary ingredients are sour cabbage or sauerkraut (–ø–æ–¥–≤–∞—Ä–∞–∫ –æ–¥ –∫–∏—Å–µ–ª–æ–≥ –∫—É–ø—É—Å–∞) or fresh cabbage (–ø–æ–¥–≤–∞—Ä–∞–∫ –æ–¥ —Å–ª–∞—Ç–∫–æ–≥ –∫—É–ø—É—Å–∞), finely chopped onions and meat, usually pork roast or lightly cooked chicken, which are then combined and baked in an oven in order for all flavors to combine. It is considered poor man's food in parts of Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia. The dish is commonly seasoned with very finely chopped bacon (typically fried together with chopped onions), garlic, ground paprika and sometimes, but not commonly, tomato sauce or chopped sausage. Bacon is often used as flavoring even when the meat ingredient is chicken or turkey meat. The meal is often made in larger quantities for family gatherings in the winter time (it is a common addition to the table at Christmas or family gatherings in the days after Christmas in both Serb and Croat communities in the area), and is used as both the main dish or as a meatless (made with bacon, onions and vegetables only) side dish. In Bosniak Muslim communities in the Balkans, the dish is made without bacon or pork, with poultry, beef, or lamb; sometimes lamb pastrami or beef sujuk are used as cured, smoked flavoring for the dish.  Similar dishes  * Polish bigos is a similar dish, both meals probably stemming from common traditional Slavic sauerkraut predecessor dishes, with the main difference being that podvarak is always baked in the oven to caramelize meat and sauerkraut for deeper flavor, and sometimes baked in a saƒç, outdoors, for additional smokiness. * Wedding cabbage is a traditional Serbian dish. The main ingredients are cabbage and a meat, which could be pork, bacon, lamb or mutton.

He was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, but spent most of his career in Australia. He became a film director at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies in 1965 and subsequently a lecturer in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Sydney in 1973, a post he held until he retired in 1993. Sandall was a strong critic of romantic primitivism and the concept of the noble savage; he was an advocate of modern civilization. In Sandall's view, romantic primitivism places far too high a value on cultures that were often characterised by, among other aspects, limited human rights, religious intolerance, disease and poverty. Other negative aspects he discusses include domestic oppression (usually of women and children), violence, clan/tribal warfare, poor care of the environment and considerable restriction on artistic freedom of expression. Designer tribalism Sandall coined the term designer tribalism to describe the attitudes of those western anthropologists (e.g. Margaret Mead) who constructed an idyllic but imaginary past for tribal cultures. Designer tribalism is the end result of a process where brutal aspects of primitive ways of life (e.g. human sacrifice and clan warfare) become forgotten and such cultures end up being morally transfigured. Designer tribalism praises primitive cultures as being deeply in touch with nature and living in harmony with animals and plants. Sandall disagrees, pointing out that some cultures were far from friendly to the environment, e.g. the MƒÅori in New Zealand were responsible for massive deforestation and the extinction of several indigenous species of birds (most notably the moa). Similarly, the religion, art and music of tribal cultures are held to be deeply meaningful and profound. The corresponding aspects of western civilization are usually denigrated and despised, as are western science and technology. In an appendix in his book, Sandall describes the Disneyfication of the noble savage, a term that encapsulates many of his beliefs in just a few sentences: :\\"Sentimentalism begets puerility. The ruthless scalpers of yesterday become Loving Persons. One-time ferocious fighters are discovered to be Artists at Heart. Hollywood becomes interested. ... Soon the primitive is elevated above the civilized. ... The moral transfiguration of real-life tribal culture into the imaginary landscape of romantic primitivism is now complete. The defining texts of this last stage are two: The Man-Eating Myth by William Arens, an influential book denying that cannibalism ever existed; and the 1995 Disney epic: Pocahontas\\".

He is deputy chairman of the London law firm Mishcon de Reya. He holds the chair in Law and Arts in the Faculty of Laws at University College London. He is also chairman of the economics consultancy, Oxera. Life The son of a London menswear retailer, who died young from a brain tumour, Julius was educated at the City of London School. He studied English literature at Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating in 1977 with a first class degree; in the mid-1990s he completed a PhD in English literature at University College London under the novelist and academic Dan Jacobson. He joined the Bloomsbury law firm Mishcon de Reya in 1979, becoming a partner in 1984. Currently, he is deputy chairman of that firm.[3] Activities Julius is a commercial litigator. He is a specialist in the fields of defamation, international trade disputes, and media law. He has been a solicitor advocate since at least 2001,[4] which allows him to act as a barrister in so far as he can now appear in the High Court and the Court of Appeal. He was selected by Diana, Princess of Wales, as her legal representative when she divorced Charles, Prince of Wales, in 1996. He was vice-president of the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, until it closed in 2012. He was one of the charity's founders and its first chairman. He represented Deborah Lipstadt, successfully defending her in Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt, with Richard Rampton QC, against a libel suit brought against her by Holocaust denier David Irving. Lipstadt and her publishers were vindicated by the judge's ruling in April 2000. A feature film about the case, Denial, with Andrew Scott playing Julius, was released in 2016. Julius is legal advisor to the Foundation of Jewish Heritage. He has written a number of books on various topics, outlined below, including his PhD thesis, in which he charged T. S. Eliot with antisemitism. He is writing his fifth book, on censorship of the arts in liberal democracies, which is due for release in 2020. Julius is an advisory editor at the current affairs journal Fathom.[5] He was a founding member of both Engage and the Euston Manifesto. From 2011 to 2014 he was chairman of the board of The Jewish Chronicle.[2] From 1996 to 1998 he was a part-time lecturer at the Law Faculty of University College London. In 2017 he rejoined University College London as the inaugural chair in Law and the Arts. He was previously chairman of the London Consortium and visiting professor at Birkbeck, University of London. He serves as trustee to English PEN, the founding centre of a worldwide writers' association. Julius is also chairman of the trustees of Phenomen Trust. Between 2007 and 2013 he played an active role in the campaign against the academic boycott of Israeli universities. In a Guardian article co-authored with historian Simon Schama, Julius wrote \\"This is not the first boycott call directed at Jews. On 1 April 1933, a week after he came to power, Hitler ordered a boycott of Jewish shops, banks, offices and department stores.\\"[6] Julius's other activities in this context included representing Ronnie Fraser in an action against the University and College Union (UCU). Fraser, who was a member of the union, complained that it had created an \\"intimidating\\", \\"hostile\\" environment, \\"offensive\\" to his Jewish identity. After a 20-day hearing the tribunal rejected his claim, harshly rebuking Julius for \\"misusing the legal process\\". Scorn is also invoked for Julius's decision to pursue certain points, with complaints variously dismissed as \\"palpably groundless\\", \\"obviously hopeless\\" and \\"devoid of any merit\\". Mr R Fraser -v- University & College Union, Courts and Tribunals Judiciary The rejection attracted criticism from CAMERA. Private life He married Judith Bernie in 1979; the couple had four children, but later divorced. In 1999, he married Dina Rabinovitch and had one child with her. Rabinovitch died in 2007 from breast cancer. In 2009, he married Katarina Lester, and is step-father to her two children. They had a son together in 2011.[11] Selected publications * T. S.

The park area includes a large part of the Barisan mountain range, which form the western spine of Sumatra island and includes the highest peak in Sumatra, Mount Kerinci (3,805 m), one of more than five active volcanoes in the national park. This mainly montane park includes hot springs, rivers with rapids, caves, scenic waterfalls, and the highest caldera lake in Southeast Asia - Lake Gunung Tujuh, while the Great Sumatran fault runs through the national park making the area of great interest to geologists. The park completely encircles the populated Kerinci valley. Flora and fauna The park is home to diverse flora and fauna.\\"Kerinci Seblat National Park Bird and Mammal List\\" Over 4,000 plant species have been identified to date in the park area, including the world's largest flower, Rafflesia arnoldi, and the plant with the largest unbranched inflorescence, the titan arum. The fauna include Sumatran tigers, and the park is recognised under the Global Tiger Initiative as one of the 12 most important protected areas in the world for tiger conservation. A recent study shows that the Kerinci Seblat National Park in central Sumatra has the highest population of tigers on the island, estimated to be at 165-190 individuals. The park also was shown to have the highest tiger occupancy rate of the protected areas, with 83% of the park showing signs of tigers.Wibisono HT, Linkie M, Guillera-Arroita G, Smith JA, Sunarto, et al.

The Asian golden cats can be found everywhere in the national park, as they adapt well to various kinds of habitat, both forested and open spaces. One camera trap image gave a rare photo of a golden cat mother moving a cub to another location with her mouth. Other highly endangered species include Sumatran dhole, Sumatran elephants, Sunda clouded leopard, Malayan tapir, and Malayan sun bear. In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature added a second species of muntjak deer to the Sumatran list of fauna with the rediscovery of the Sumatran muntjac, a deer not recorded since the late 1920s and now concluded as a new species and not subspecies. The park also protects more than 370 bird species, including the Sumatran ground-cuckoo rediscovered in the park in 2002. The Kerinci area is home to more than 300 bird species, including 17 of Sumatra's 20 endemic birds, making it of particular importance to ornithologists and bird-watching enthusiasts.Antara News: Kerinci Seblat potential world birdwatching destination: observer, 21 March 2011 The population of Sumatran rhinoceros in the park was estimated to number around 500 in the 1980s,SOS Rhino : Rhino population at Indonesian reserve drops by 90 percent in 14 years , 18 March 2012 but due to poaching, the Kerinci Seblat population is now considered extinct.Save The Rhino : Sumatran rhino numbers revised downwards, 18 March 2012 Conservation and threats The national park was declared in 1982, formed from numerous watershed protection forests or hutan lindung and small nature reserves, although its borders were only legally confirmed in the late 1990s. Together with Bukit Barisan Selatan and Gunung Leuser National Parks, it forms a World Heritage Site, Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra. Since 2011 the UNESCO also lists this world heritage as World Heritage in Danger. Kerinci Seblat National Park is also recognised as an ASEAN Heritage Site. Wildlife conservation program To practicing personal relations with Sumatran elephants, Seblat Elephant Conservation Center in Bengkulu Province is the sole center which receives local and foreign students. Until June 2012, the students (volunteers) came from France, Russia, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Belgium, and from within the country. At the 7-day course, they learn how an elephant tamer takes care of the elephants. They also help feeding and bathing the 19 elephants at the center feeding milk to a two-year-old elephant calf. The students make a report once they return to their respective home countries.

Dr Alfred Harold Wood OBE (4 May 1896 ‚Äì 1989) was a 20th-century Australian Christian minister, educator, writer, hymnologist and advocate of church union. Early life Wood was born in Geelong, Victoria, the son of Alfred Wood (1867‚Äì1941) and Janet (nee Wemyss; 1866‚Äì1959), who were Salvation Army officers. He was educated in Sydney and initially qualified as a barrister in Victoria. Career in Tonga Converting to Methodism, Wood was ordained a Methodist minister in 1924 and his new bride, medical doctor Olive (nee O'Reilly) left immediately to a missionary appointment in the Kingdom of Tonga, where he was known as Haloti 'Uti (Harold Wood) and she 'Olife (Olive). In their 13 years in the Pacific nation, they developed a special fondness and love for the people and the country. Early on, Wood supported Queen Salote with legal advice in her work to reconcile two Methodist factions and became well acquainted with and respected by the Royal Family and others. Appointed principal of Free Wesleyan boys' boarding school Tupou College, the school moved from Nuku'alofa west to Nafualu under his leadership, and grew from 30 students to almost 400, becoming the biggest school in the country. At Wood's urging, scholarships were offered by the Tongan government to enable students to further their education in Australia, or go to Fiji for medical training. Wood learned the Tongan language fluently and wrote (English-language) books on Tongan history and geography which were still used as secondary school textbooks into the 21st century. Wood was also responsible for the training in Tonga of candidates for church ministry. Career in Melbourne Returning to Australia in 1937, Wood became principal of Methodist Ladies' College (MLC) in Kew, Victoria, from 1939 until his retirement in 1966. From 1966 to 1977 he served as a parish minister at Deepdene Methodist (now Uniting) Church in Nungerner Street, Deepdene, Melbourne, which he caused to be renamed St Paul's. Wood attained a doctorate of Divinity in 1947, with a dissertation on church union (published as Unity Without Uniformity). He was President of the Methodist Church of Victoria and Tasmania in 1952‚Äì53 and President-General of the Methodist Church of Australasia 1957‚Äì60 (all while principal of MLC). An ardent advocate of church union, he lived to see the formation of the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977. A renowned orator, Wood preached at least twice most Sundays and his sermons were frequently reported in the press. He was a regular at Speakers' Corner on the Yarra River, and a keynote speaker at the first National Christian Youth Convention, held in 1955. A vocal opponent of nuclear weapons, the Vietnam War and the White Australia policy, he was under ASIO surveillance from 1954 to 1972. Progressive in his day, he was never, however, a Communist. An accomplished pianist, Wood chaired the ecumenical committee to produce the ecumenical Australian Hymn Book (elsewhere titled With One Voice) published in 1977 (). Personal life Wood married North Shore medical doctor Olive K. O'Reilly in 1924. They had six children, all born in Tonga. Among them were Dr Elizabeth Wood-Ellem, Pacific historian and author of the definitive biography of Queen Salote of Tonga, actor Monica Maughan and churchman and hymnologist Rev. Dr H. D'Arcy Wood, who was President of the National Assembly of the Uniting Church from 1991 to 1994. After Olive's death in 1976, he married Dora Walker (1920‚Äì2014). Wood died in Melbourne in 1989, aged 93. Honours The mainly Tongan congregation in Auburn, New South Wales named their church after him: Harold Wood Auburn Uniting Church. He was awarded an OBE.

The December 2005 IISc shooting occurred on Wednesday, 28 December 2005 at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in the Indian city of Bangalore, killing Prof. Munish Chandra Puri of IIT Delhi and injuring four, after two or more unidentified gunmen fired at Puri and others. The state government of Karnataka declared the shooting to be a terrorist attack, making it the first such attack in Bangalore. Shooting At around 7:00 pm local time (1:30 pm GMT), two people entered the IISc campus in a white Ambassador car. At around 7:20 pm, delegates attending the International Conference on Operations Research: Applications in Infrastructure Development, organised by the Operations Research Society of India at the JN Tata Auditorium on the IISc campus, were heading to dinner when the shooting began. A gunman, wearing black mask and army uniform, started firing indiscriminately from a rifle, thought to be a Chinese Type 56, outside the auditorium. Munish Chandra Puri, a Professor Emeritus at the mathematics department of the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, was wounded by bullets. He died en route to hospital. Three other scientists and a lab assistant were among the injured. One of the injured was a pregnant woman, who sustained injuries to her eye. The other three injured had serious bullet injuries and underwent emergency surgeries. Investigation and trial The police later recovered a Chinese made Type 56 military rifle, twelve empty cartridges, one empty magazine, five live magazines (one half-spent), two grenades, and one live hand-grenade which they defused. The police surmise that the gunmen had escaped by scaling the boundary wall of the campus. No organisation claimed responsibility. The Karnataka police identified the attackers as belonging to a cell of the Pakistan-based terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Six people were convicted in December 2011 and several others are at large including the shooter. In 2007, possible links arose between the shooting and Bilal Abdullah and Kafeel Ahmed, the perpetrators of two terrorist incidents that occurred in the United Kingdom that same year. Investigations were carried out to unearth these purported links.

His theoretical work was first developed in Material Culture and Mass Consumption and is summarised more recently in his book Stuff. This is concerned to transcend the usual dualism between subject and object and to study how social relations are created through consumption as an activity. Miller is also the founder of the digital anthropology programme at University College London (UCL), and the director the Why We Post and ASSA projects. He has pioneered the study of digital anthropology and especially ethnographic research on the use and consequences of social media and smartphones as part of the everyday life of ordinary people around the world. Education Miller was educated at Highgate School and St John's College, Cambridge, where he read archaeology and anthropology.'Cambridge Tripos results: first and second class', Times, 20 June 1974. He has spent his entire professional life at the Department of Anthropology at the University College London, which has become a research centre for the study of material culture and where, more recently, he established the world's first programme dedicated to the study of digital anthropology. Anthropological position A prolific author, Miller criticises the concept of materialism which presumes human relationships to things are at the expense of human relationship to other persons. He argues that most people are either enabled to form close relationships to both persons and objects or have difficulties with both. With Miller's students he has applied these ideas to many genres of material culture such as clothing, homes, media and the car, through research based on the methods of traditional anthropological ethnography in regions including the Caribbean, India and London. In the study of clothing, his work ranges from a book on the Sari in India to more recent research explaining the popularity of blue jeans and the way they exemplify the struggle to become ordinary. His initial work on the consequences of the internet for Trinidad was followed by studies of the impact of mobile phones on poverty in Jamaica and more recently the way Facebook has changed the nature of social relationships. Miller's work on material culture also includes ethnographic research on how people develop relationships of love and care through the acquisition of objects in shopping and how they deal with issues of separation and loss including death through their retention and divestment of objects. He argues that since we cannot control death as an event, we use our ability to control the gradual separation from the objects associated with the deceased as a way of dealing with loss. Complementary to this work on separation from things are three books about shopping, the most influential of which, A Theory of Shopping, looks at how the study of everyday purchases can be a route to understanding how love operates within the family. He has also carried out several projects on female domestic labour and being a mother, including studies of au pairs, and Filipina women in London and their relationship to their left behind children in the Philippines. Most of these projects are collaborations. Since the early 2000s, Miller has been researching the effects of new social media on society. Several of his most recent books explore topics such as cell phones,Miller, Daniel and Horst, H. (2006). The Cell Phone: An Anthropology of Communication. Oxford: Berg. FacebookMiller, Daniel. (2011). Tales from Facebook. Cambridge: Polity. and transnational families.Miller, Daniel and Madianou, M. (2012). Migration and New Media: Transnational Families and Polymedia. London: Routledge. Together with presenting a theoretical framework for studying social networking sites,Miller, Daniel and Horst, H. Editors (2012) Digital Anthropology. Oxford: Berg. his latest work has proposed new concepts such as of 'polymedia'Miller, Daniel (2013). DR 2: What is the relationship between identities that people construct, express and consume online and those offline? in Future Identities: Changing identities in the UK ‚Äì the next 10 years. Foresight, p.6. and 'Scalable Sociality' as analytical tools for examining the consequences of a situation where individuals configure and are held responsible for their choice of media, while access and cost recede as factors. In 2009, Miller created a new Master's programme in Digital anthropology at the Anthropology Department of University College London. Before establishing a new master's programme in digital anthropology, Miller worked with Haidy Geismar who is also an anthropologist, on the examination of the project. In 2012, Miller launched a five-year project called 'Why We Post', to examine the global impact of new social media. The study was based on ethnographic data collected through the course of 15 months in China, India, Turkey, Italy, United Kingdom, Trinidad, Chile and Brazil. The project was funded by the European Research Council. The project published eleven Open Access volumes with UCL Press which have now passed one million downloadsSource: UCL Press. The Why We Post monographs are currently also being published in the languages of their respective fieldsites. In addition, a free online course (MOOC) is available on FutureLearn. The course is also available in Chinese, Portuguese, Hindi, Tamil, Italian, Turkish, and Spanish on UCLeXtend. In addition a website containing key discoveries, stories and over 100 films is available in the same 8 languages. In 2017 Miller launched a second five-year project, The Anthropology of Smartphones and Smart Ageing (ASSA), which consists of ten simultaneous ethnographies in Brazil, Cameroon, Chile, China, Japan, Al-Quds (East Jerusalem), Ireland, Italy and Uganda. This project demonstrates how smartphones have developed beyond a youth technology, by focusing on usage by people in mid-life. It also considers cheaper alternatives to mHealth through using everyday apps for health purposes and making these more sensitive to social and cultural contexts. A general book called The Global Smartphone is due for publication in 2021. Currently, the ASSA team are also completing ten ethnographic monographs on the subject of ageing with smartphones. Additional publications will focus on their research concerning mHealth. Major works * (1984) Miller, D. and Tilley, C. (Eds.) Ideology, Power and Prehistory.

She is noted for her artworks featuring stylized renderings of children. Early life Her love of art was influenced by her mother, a concert pianist, and her father, a businessman and art connoisseur. She studied music and art throughout childhood, giving her first piano recital at age 15, and her first art exhibitions in Vienna and Salzburg at age 18. Artistic career Pursuing her dream to be both a great artist and musician, Rodo soon found that time would not permit the necessary devotion to both her passions. At 22, she turned all of her energy to painting. She studied etching and printmaking along with Ren√© Carcan under Johnny Friedlaender in Paris. She married a Frenchman, Boulanger, so that her public name became Graciela Rodo de Boulanger (Spanish) and Graciela Rodo Boulanger (French). In 1966, her artistic ambition began to be realized when she published her first editions of engravings and first exhibited in the United States. In 1979, UNICEF designated her official artist for the International Year of the Child poster, and two of her tapestries were presented in the hall of the UN General Assembly. The Museum of Modern Art of Latin America, in Washington, DC, gave a retrospective of her oeuvre in 1983. In 1986, the Metropolitan Opera of New York commissioned her poster for Mozart‚Äôs The Magic Flute, and her paintings were shown by the Art Gallery of Lincoln Center. In 1993, the World Federation of the UN Associations chose one of her paintings to illustrate both a stamp and a limited-edition print on endangered species.

She wrote the first newspaper advice column, Dear Beatrice Fairfax, in 1898, the precursor to modern versions such as Dear Abby and Ann Landers. Early life Manning was born in Washington, DC to Elizabeth Barrett and Michael Charles Manning. Her year of birth, while thought to be 1872, was unknown to even her immediate family and closest confidants during her lifetime. She was educated at various private schools in the District of Columbia, graduating from Miss Kerr's, a finishing school for girls. Her mother had died in childbirth and her father died when she was 18 years old. This sent her to England in the early 1890s to live with relatives; here she studied British society and wrote her first novel, Lord Alingham, Bankrupt. It was published in 1902. Manning began writing as a columnist for the New York World in 1896 at the \\"space rate\\" of $5 per week. After being granted an exclusive interview with the President of the United States, Grover Cleveland, she was promoted to permanent staff and her salary was raised to $30 per week. When the paper's Editor moved to the New York Evening Journal in 1898, she followed at his invitation. There she collaborated with two other women to create a women's page entitled the \\"Hen Coop\\". Dear Beatrice Fairfax During the same year, the Hen Coop received three readers' letters seeking personal advice. Manning suggested a new column exclusively devoted to personal advice. The column was named Dear Beatrice Fairfax at her suggestion, after Dante's Beatrice and her own family's country home in Fairfax County, Virginia. The column began on July 20, 1898 as the first advice column in the United States. Her advice was an immediate success, and the column received so many letters that the United States Post Office soon refused to deliver them and the Journal had to retrieve the letters itself. Manning's commonsense advice was tremendously popular and was imitated nationwide. But Manning's efforts went largely unrewarded by the newspaper, and her pay and status remained low. She eventually resigned. Novels During her lifetime, Manning had four novels published: *Lord Alingham, Bankrupt (1902) *Judith of the Plains (1903) *Personal Reply (1943) *Ladies Now and Then (1945) Marriage and freelance career On June 12, 1905, Manning married Herman Eduard Gasch, a real estate agent, and devoted most of her life to raising her two sons. During this time she freelanced and her short stories were published in various magazines including Harper's Monthly and Ladies' Home Journal. She was an ardent suffragist and marched and lobbied for the cause, supported by her like-minded husband. Return to column Manning had invested an inheritance from her father in the markets in order to supplement her husband's earnings, and the loss of this money in the Wall Street Crash of 1929 caused the family financial hardship. Manning went back to work for the New York Evening Journal, again writing her Beatrice Fairfax column (which had been syndicated for years). She wrote the column until her death in 1945.  Cultural references  There are references to Beatrice Fairfax in several popular songs of her era. One is in the opening verse of George and Ira Gershwin's song \\"But Not For Me\\", from the 1930 musical Girl Crazy: Beatrice Fairfax, don't you dare Ever tell me he will care. I'm certain It's the final curtain... Another is in the verse of the 1919 song \\"Take Your Girlie To The Movies\\", by Bert Kalmar, Edgar Leslie, and Pete Wendling: Beatrice Fairfax gives advice, To anyone in love; That's why Johnny Gray Wrote to her one day... A third is in the song \\"Nobody Makes a Pass at Me\\", from Harold Rome's 1937 revue Pins and Needles (later made famous by Barbra Streisand): Oh Beatrice Fairfax, give me the bare facts, How do you make them fall? If you don't save me, the things the Lord gave me Never will be any use to me at all. There is a poem by Kenneth Fearing entitled \\"Dear Beatrice Fairfax\\" in which he metaphorically lambastes social status as product guarantees. Another popular song from 1919, \\"Oh By Jingo! (Oh By Gee You're The Only Girl For Me),\\" by Albert Von Tilzer with lyrics by Lew Brown, makes a reference in the third verse: : Home they went with spirits wilted : On account of they were jilted : (All the By-Goshes, with hearts down to their galoshes!) : All winter long they brooded‚Äîthat is, all but very few did : (They left to join a fan club for Lana Toyn-a.) : The rest wrote to Beatrice Fairfax : Got the how-to-make-him-care facts : So came the spring : They sailed once more to sing...

Although demand letters are not legally required they are frequently used, especially in contract law, tort law, and commercial law cases. For example, if one anticipates a breach, it is advantageous to send a demand letter asserting that the other side appears to be in breach and requesting assurances of performances. Demand letters that are not responded to may constitute admissions by silence. Also, a demand letter will often generate a denial letter stating the basis for rejecting your side's claim (such as when the incorrect entity is sued), and is sometimes a good indication of what defenses will be raised if a suit is brought later.Fundamentals of Litigation for Paralegals by Marlene Maerowitz & Thomas Mauet. Eighth Edition. Demand letters are sometimes used as a form of harassment and/or intimidation. Insurance claims In personal injury claims, the settlement negotiation process begins by the victim submitting a demand letter to the insurance companies. The purpose of the demand letter is to present facts about the accident in order to persuade the insurance companies to provide adequate compensation. A typical demand letter is structured in the following manner: * Description of the Accident * Discussion of Accident Liability * Description of Personal injuries * Description of Medical treatments * List of Medical Bills/Lost Income Statements * Injury Settlement Demand The personal injury demand letter is then sent to the insurance companies with supplemental documents that are referenced in the letter. This may include copies of accident reports, photographs of the accident/injuries, medical bills, doctor's statements etc. The insurance company will then analyze the arguments made in the demand letter and respond with a counter settlement offer.

It is nearly 45 km from Peshawar and 18 km from Mardan and is located at 34¬∞4'52N 71¬∞58'21E.Location of Risalpur - Falling Rain In a basin some 1014 feet above sea level, it is bounded on the south and west by the Kabul and Kalpani rivers, respectively. The famous Khyber Pass lies 90 kilometers to the north. Risalpur is known as \\"Home of Eagles\\" and \\"Home of Sappers\\". It has several important educational institutions and industrial plants. The Risalpur Export Processing Zone is on the main Nowshera-Mardan road. The Risalpur Cantonment itself lies on high ground, some 30 feet above the surrounding area, with the oldest building dating from 1913 or 1914. Military history In 1910 Risalpur had a former aerodrome and airfield of the Royal Flying Corps, and later the Royal Air Force. During the First World War, the Royal Flying Corps established an airfield and a fighter conversion unit at Risalpur in British India. In the Second World War and by 1940, RAF Risalpur had become both an established training and an operational airfield of the Royal Air Force (RAF) of the United Kingdom. It officially became the airfield of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) on 15 August 1947. No. 31 Squadron RAF was stationed at Risalpur in 1919 and was used to bomb Afghanistan Kabul Jalalabad and later operation in FATA, against Faqir of Ipi in Waziristan, along with No. 114 Squadron RAF of the Royal Air Force of Britain. The No. 31 Squadron RAF was formed at Farnborough on October 11, 1915. Its first deployment was to Risalpur's Nowshera District of Pakhtunkhwa province (previously North-West Frontier Province), in British India. With its BE2Cs and Farmans, and during this time No. 31 Squadron RAF and No. 114 Squadron RAF and took part in operations in the Third Anglo-Afghan War and being part of The Great Game, on the North-West Frontier and FATA. The bombing was done to ensure the patency of the Durand line border between Afghanistan and British India. In September 1919 BE2s of the Royal Flying Corps were replaced by Bristol Fighters. The No. 31 Squadron RAF and No. 114 Squadron RAF bombing of Kabul Afghanistan and FATA stopped with signing of Rawalpindi Agreement in Rawalpindi (signed on 8 August 1919 and amended on 22 November 1921) between the British India and Afghanistan, celebrated as Afghanistan's National Day now. No. 114 Squadron RAF was disbanded by being re-numbered No 28 on 1 Apr 1920. But the Waziristan campaign (1936‚Äì1939) continued in FATA and Bannu Pakhtunkhwa against Faqir of Ipi, included the aircraft Hawker Harts, Westland Wapitis and Hawker Audaxs flying from Risalpur and Peshawar. The No. 31 Squadron RAF air support role in the FATA campaign against Faqir of Ipi in Mir Ali and in Wanna, and that in Pakhtunkhwa's district of Bannu is noted. Trouble flared up on 23 July 1938, when a lashkar launched a daring attack on the town of Bannu, Mir Ali and Wanna, killing up to 200 civilians and damaging a considerable amount of property. At the height of the campaign, some 60,000 regular and irregular troops were employed by the British in an effort to bring in control an estimated 4,000 hostile tribesmen of FATA. In April 1939 the No. 31 Squadron RAF changed to the bomber and transport role. During 1941, the No. 31 Squadron RAF began to concentrate on transport duties with seconded DC-2s. Returning to India the No. 31 Squadron RAF re-equipped with the Dakota. After the Japanese invasion of Burma, No. 31 Squadron RAF flew missions between Calcutta and Rangoon dropping supplies for the XIVth Army. After World War II the No. 31 Squadron RAF moved to Java. In 1946 the Squadron was disbanded in Java and reformed at PAF Base Masroor, Maripur Karachi. At the end of 1947 No. 31 Squadron RAF was again disbanded, but reformed in July 1948 in Britain. During British rule, the British Army's 14/20th Hussars were garrisoned for two years at Risalpur, Nowshera Pakhtunkhwa until 1933. It is stated that the army of 14th/20th Hussars stayed in Risalpur town of Nowshera Pakhtunkhwa until 1933 in fact they never arrived for their tour of duty in British India until early in 1934. Upon arriving from Egypt, where they had previously been stationed for two years, they disembarked in Karachi and immediately traveled to the Risalpur town of district Nowshera North West Frontier Province and stayed there until late in 1936 whereupon they were transferred to Lucknow. The Royal Horse Artillery were also stationed at Risalpur Town of District Nowshera of Pakhtunkhwa.Horse Gunners by W G Clarke The Royal Artillery Institution 1993 The airfield was formally established as PAF Station Risalpur, after the creation of Pakistan on 15 August 1947 with 20 officers, 21 trainees, 23 senior non commissioned officers (SNCOs) and 257 airmen. The airfield comprised only a handful of men and some equipment. One month later, the Flying Training School was established here. Wing Commander Asghar Khan, later to become the first Air Chief of the PAF, took over as the first Officer Commanding of the school, with Harvard and Tiger Moth aircraft in the inventory. Flt Lt M Khyber Khan, who later rose to the rank of Air Vice Marshal, and his student, Flight Cadet Akhtar, flew the first training sortie on 22 September 1947. On 13 April 1948, the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, visited Risalpur Flying Training School and raised its level to that of a college. Risalpur thus became the genesis of PAF pilots. It became the only military academy of Pakistan to be visited by Jinnah. At this ceremony, Jinnah took the General Salute at the parade. Fighter aircraft from Peshawar Airbase, from the nearby Peshawar district of Pakhtunkhwa performed aerobatics at the event. On 21 January 1967 President Ayub Khan elevated the status of the Pakistan Air Force College, Risalpur to that of a Pakistan Air Force Academy. Currently, it consists of five different components. At the heart of the Pakistan Air Force since its inception, the Pakistan Air Force Academy, Risalpur's Nowshera Pakhtunkhwa, has bred generations of officers for the PAF and other branches of the Pakistani Armed Forces. The Pakistan Air Force Academy at Nowshera Pakhtunkhwa was established in 1947.  Incidents  On 9 November 2007, unknown miscreants fired three rockets that landed near Risalpur in Nowshera District, without causing any damage to life or property. On 24 August 2011 at least 16 people, including some army and air force personnel, were killed and 17 injured when a powerful explosion hit a hotel in Risalpur.

Its GRAU designation is 3M80, air launched variant is the Kh-41 and its NATO reporting name is SS-N-22 Sunburn. The missile system was designed by the Raduga Design Bureau during the 1970s as a follow up to the P-120 Malakhit (NATO reporting name \\"SS-N-9 Siren\\"). The Moskit was originally designed to be ship-launched, but variants have been adapted to be launched from land (modified trucks), underwater (submarines) and air (reportedly the Sukhoi Su-33, a naval variant of the Sukhoi Su-27), as well as on the Lun-class ekranoplan. The missile can carry conventional and nuclear warheads. The exact classification of the missile is unknown, with varying types reported. This uncertainty is due to the secrecy surrounding an active military weapon. The missile has been purchased and exported to the People's Liberation Army Navy (China) and Indian Navy (India). Design A ship of the Pacific Fleet fires Moskit cruise missiles in the Sea of Japan, 2019 It reaches a speed of at high altitude and Mach 2.2 at low-altitude. This speed is 4.25 to 3 times more than speed of the subsonic American Harpoon. The Moskit was designed to be employed against smaller NATO naval groups in the Baltic Sea (Danish and German) and the Black Sea (Turkish) and non-NATO vessels in the Pacific (Japanese, South Korean, etc.), and to defend the Russian mainland against NATO amphibious assault. The missile can perform intensive anti-defense maneuvers with overloads in excess of 10g, which completed for before the target. Variants of the missile have been designated 3M80M, 3M82 (Moskit M). The P-270 designation is believed to be the initial product codename for the class of missile, with the Russian Ministry of Defense GRAU indices (starting with 3M) designating the exact variant of the missile. The 3M80 was its original model. The 3M80M model (also termed 3M80E for export) was a 1984 longer range version of the missile, with the latest version with the longest range being the 3M82 Moskit M. The ASM-MSS / Kh-41 variant is the 1993 air-launched version of the missile. The 3M80MVE variant has an optional longer range through a second, high-altitude flight profile setting, however using the higher altitude profile would make the missile detectable at much greater distances.

R-factor was first demonstrated in Shigella in 1959 by Japanese scientists. Often, R-factors code for more than one antibiotic resistance factor: genes that encode resistance to unrelated antibiotics may be carried on a single R-factor, sometimes up to 8 different resistances. Many R-factors can pass from one bacterium to another through bacterial conjugation and are a common means by which antibiotic resistance spreads between bacterial species, genera and even families. For example, RP1, a plasmid that encodes resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and kanamycin originated in a species of Pseudomonas, from the family Pseudomonadaceae, but can also be maintained in bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli. Transmission Bacteria containing F-factors (said to be \\"F+\\") have the capability for horizontal gene transfer; they can construct a sex pilus, which emerges from the donor bacterium and ensnares the recipient bacterium, draws it in, and eventually triggers the formation of a mating bridge, merging the cytoplasms of two bacteria via a controlled pore. This pore allows the transfer of genetic material, such as a plasmid. Conjugation allows two bacteria, not necessarily from the same species, to transfer genetic material one way. Since many R-factors contain F-plasmids, antibiotic resistance can be easily spread among a population of bacteria. Also, R-factors can be taken up by \\"DNA pumps\\" in their membranes via transformation, or less commonly through viral mediated transduction, or via bacteriophage, although conjugation is the most common means of antibiotic resistance spread. They contain the gene called RTF (Resistance transfer factor).

He is best known today for photographs depicting his series of closely controlled \\"Aktionen\\" featuring such iconography as a dead fish, a dead chicken, bare light bulbs, colored liquids, bound objects, and a man wrapped in gauze. The enduring themes of Schwarzkogler's works involved experience of pain and mutilation, often in an incongruous clinical context, such as 3rd Aktion (1965) in which a patient's head swathed in bandages is being pierced by what appears to be a corkscrew, producing a bloodstain under the bandages. They reflect a message of despair at the disappointments and hurtfulness of the world. Chris Burden once remarked that a 1970s Newsweek article, which had mentioned himself and Schwarzkogler, had misreported that Schwarzkogler had died by slicing off his penis during a performance. (Most likely the article Burden was recalling is Robert Hughes, \\"The Decline and Fall of the Avant-Garde,\\" Time, December 18, 1972) A scene in Schwarzkogler's foto-performances had been starry-eyed misinterpreted. The castration theme in some of them -- for example, in Aktion 2 he posed with a sliced open fish covering his groin -- have additionally fueled this myth. Additionally, the protagonist of the Aktion in which the cutting of a penis was simulated was not Schwarzkogler himself, but his friend and model, the renowned photographer Hans Cibulka. When Schwarzkogler died, the series of performances had long been concluded. He was found beneath a window from which he had fallen, seemingly the victim of an accident. His death generated speculations and further myths.

History Hawker Hurricane of No. 2 Squadron RIAF at Risalpur before moving to Eastern India for training in support of the Chindits The history of Risalpur airbase dates back to 1910 when an airstrip was developed there. During the First World War, the Royal Flying Corps established a base at Risalpur. In December 1915 RAF's newly raised No. 31 Squadron was stationed here, which was later used against troublesome tribesmen of the Tribal areas along the Afghan border. The squadron flew B.E.2c and Farman biplane in ground support missions. On 24 May 1919, Handley Page V/1500 flew its first mission to attack Kabul from the airfield. In 1925 the air fleet of base was tasked to carry out a survey of the about four hundred square miles area of Ravi's old river bed for finding ancient sites. After First World War, the No. 11 Squadron of Royal Air Force equipped with Westland Wapiti was stationed at the base in 1928, that was also used in the operations in the tribal areas. The bombers of this squadron were used By 1940, Risalpur had become both a training and an operational base. During the Second World War, an operational training squadron was stationed at Risalpur, besides the base also conducted fighter conversion courses. A trainee pilot in front of Hawker Hurricane of No. 151 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit at Risalpur After the departure of the British, Risalpur was like an abandoned airfield. The airfield was formally established after Pakistan became an independent nation on 15 August 1947 with 20 officers, 21 trainees, 23 senior non-commissioned officers (SNCOs) and 257 airmen. The base comprised only a handful of men and some equipment. About a month later, the Flying Training School was established at Risalpur, that carried out Initial, elementary and advanced flying training. In September 1947, six Harvard aircraft from Flying Training School of Ambala, that were transferred to Pakistan after partition, reached Risalpur. Wing Commander Asghar Khan, later to become the first Air Chief of the PAF, took over as the first Officer Commanding of the School, with Harvard and Tiger Moth aircraft in the inventory. Flt Lt M Khyber Khan, who later rose to the rank of Air Vice Marshal, and his student, Flight Cadet Akhtar, flew the first training sortie on 22 September 1947.Syed Shabbir Hussain, \\"History of Pakistan Air Force (1947‚Äì1984)\\". During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, the airfield was used to transport personnel and other equipment to the mountain terrain of Northern Areas. In March 1950, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran, who was the first Head of state to visit Pakistan and a flyer himself, visited the academy. After fifty years of Jinnah's visit to the academy, a commemoration was held on 13 April 1997. Among other veterans, Air Marshal Asghar Khan also witnessed the ceremony who was the commandant at the time of the visit. On 13 April 1948, the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, visited Risalpur Flying Training School and raised its level to that of a college. Risalpur thus became the genesis of PAF pilots. It became the only military academy of Pakistan to be visited by Jinnah.Pakistan Times  Top Story: Pakistan celebrates Defence Day in befitting manner At this ceremony, Jinnah took the General Salute at the parade and fighter aircraft from Peshawar Air base performed aerobatics. During Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 a bomber squadron was stationed here after Peshawar Air Base was hit by IAF. On 21 January 1967 President Ayub Khan elevated the status of the PAF College, Risalpur to that of an academy. Aircraft Initially, the institution was equipped with Harvard, Tiger Moth, Auster, Fury and Tempest aircraft. A major change came with the introduction of the Lockheed T-33 jet trainer in 1955 and the air fleet of the academy was transformed from propeller to jet engine aircraft. Eight years after the College was upgraded to an Academy in 1967, the T-6G (Harvard), which had rendered extensive service to the PAF since 1947, was replaced by the Mushshak (Saab Trainer). Currently, the trainer aircraft at the PAF Academy are T-37, Mushshak MFI-17 and the K-8, the last of which was brought into service with the PAF in 1995. The academy has two aviation wings and a squadron. The Primary Flying Training (PFT) Wing consists of MFI-17 while Basic Flying Training (BFT) Wing consists of T-37 aircraft. An Advance Flying Training squadron is composed of K-8 aircraft. Additionally, the Academy has a fleet of Para Motor Gliders which are used to provide aerial experience to the cadets. These gliders are being looked after by MTW (Military Training Wing). Constituent units The PAF Academy consists of 5 components: College of Flying Training The College of Flying Training imparts four-year undergraduate programs in science along with equipping cadets of the Flying branch, with flying skills. CFT is affiliated with Air University. The college consists of Flying Training Wing, Directorate of Studies (DOS), Engineering Wing and Flying Instructors School. While the Flying Training Wing with BFT, PFT and K-8 Squadron its sub units, carry out flying training, the Engineering Wing supports the flying wing by maintaining the air fleet and the Directorate of Studies educates the flying and non- flying branch cadets about aviation sciences, administration, airspace management, humanities and other related academic disciplines. The College of Flying Training imparts education to cadets of the General Duty (Pilot), Air Defense, Administration and Special Duties, Logistics, and Navigation courses. After studying the first three semesters, the GD(P) cadets proceed to the Flying Training Wing. Similarly the others course cadets of CFT proceed for further training in SATS (School of Air Traffic Services) and ADTS (Air Defense Training School).  College of Aeronautical Engineering  College of Aeronautical Engineering (CAE) is a constituent institute of the academy, which imparts engineering education to the cadets inducted in the engineering branch of PAF. The institute was set up in July 1965 at Korangi Airfield, Karachi, with the help of US Air Force (USAF) and Colonel John H. Blakelock, a member of USAF became its first principal. The first course graduated from the college on 9 November 1968. In May 1986, the college was shifted from Karachi to Risalpur. The college conducts four-year undergraduate program in two engineering disciplines namely aerospace and avionics. CAE started postgraduate programs in 1997. The college was initially affiliated with University of Karachi and then to NED University of Engineering and Technology in March 1977. The college affiliated with National University of Sciences and Technology in 1995. The institute is equipped with modern engineering labs and workshops. CAE got ISO-9001 certified in 1999 for successfully managing quality system of its academic programs. Apart from Aerospace and Avionics, the institute has three more departments: Industrial Engineering, Humanities & Science, and Professional Continuing Education.  Flying Instructors School  The Flying Instructors School (FIS) trains instructors, not only for the PAF but also for the Pakistan Army and Navy. It trains instructors from countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa. The FIS is also responsible for the maintenance of high standards of teaching in the College of Flying Training, and the Fighter Conversion units. The re-categorization of instructors in all three armed forces is an additional responsibility of the school. FIS training includes academic training, flying training, and instructional technique. The FIS undertakes reciprocal visits to enhance training standards; between 1990 and 1997, these visits were organized with the Central Flying School, UK.  Para Training School  The Para Training School was established at the PAF Academy Risalpur in 2003. It is the second parachute school in Pakistan after the Pakistan Army Para School located at Peshawar. Before its establishment, PAF personnel were trained at the Pakistan Army Para School. The school conducts various basic and advanced courses, including free fall training. It also trains cadets to fly para motor gliders. The Special Service Wing of the PAF also receives parachute training at this school. After a rigorous physical test the top cadets are selected to do the paragliding and para-trooping courses. Paragliding involves wearing a parachute and after jumping from a height, glide and land. Cadets who successfully complete the paragliding course are entitled to wear the paragliding (PG) badge on their uniforms and they further get a chance to now fly para motor gliders which gets them to wear them the PMG badge on their uniforms.  Military Training Wing  The role of the Military Training Wing (formerly Cadet's Wing) is aimed to impart general service training and develop physical fitness, discipline, personal and leadership qualities in cadets. The subjects covered include: Cadets' Mess * Air operations * Use of Small Arms * Fieldcraft (camping, field exercises etc.) * Leadership * Character building * Physical exercises * Military drill * Sports activities * The cadets mess * Extracurricular activities * Literary activities * Educational visits * Student counselling The Military Training Wing comprises officers and instructors who monitor the activities of cadets throughout their training period. The Military Training Wing is sub-divided into four squadrons. The squadrons take part in competitions and the winning squadron is awarded the \\"Quaid-e-Azam Banner\\" at the passing out ceremony which is held at the end of term. The PAF Academy trains officers of the PAF, and cadets and officers of the Pakistan Army, Navy and other countries including Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Malaysia, Nepal, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, Turkmenistan and the UAE.Pakistan Air Force Official Website Events=Passing Out Parade The Passing Out Parade is held every six months, when the graduating cadets of flying and engineering pass out. The chief guests are usually the President, Prime Minister or the service chiefs of the armed forces of Pakistan. Graduating cadets take the Oath of Allegiance under the flag of Pakistan, after which they take the salute of the parade. The end of the parade is marked by the aerobatics display of the PAF Aerobatic team renowned as the \\"Sherdils\\" (flying T-37 aircraft) and the Academy Aerobatic team known as \\"Academy Hawks\\" (flying K-8 aircraft).

Since 1983, Infinity has been part of Harman International Industries, which became a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics in 2017. Infinity produces packages for a range of audio applications, including multichannel surround sound home theatre packages, in-wall home speakers, and marine applications. Other products include powered subwoofers and car audio amplifiers. Infinity products are installed as an option on Hyundai and Kia vehicles, some Mitsubishi vehicles from the 1990s to 2006, and many Chrysler vehicles.  History  Founded in 1968 by Arnie Nudell, John Ulrick and Cary Christie, Infinity has produced home and mobile audio products by employing innovative materials such as neodymium magnets, mylar diaphragms, and polypropylene cones. The company's first product was the Servo-Static speaker system which, as the name implies, consisted of electrostatic main panels and a revolutionary servo controlled woofer based on the bomb guidance systems Nudell was developing at the time for defense contractor Litton. In the late 1970s Infinity introduced the EMIT (electromagnetic induction tweeter) and EMIM (electromagnetic induction midrange) drivers. These were flat quasi- ribbons that worked to move air based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. The system used samarium‚Äìcobalt magnets, allowing for a very low ribbon driver mass-per-unit area. Variants were made, such as the EMIT-R (radial emit), the S-EMIT (super emit) and the L-EMIM (large emim). The IRS (Infinity Reference System) was an ultra-high end system, selling at US$65,000 in the 1980s. It consisted of 76 EMIT tweeters, 24 EMIM midrange drivers, and twelve 12-inch polypropylene woofers in four towers. The Reference, and later Kappa series, were discontinued when Nudell sold Infinity to Harman Kardon. Nudell left to form Genesis Technologies, a high-end loudspeaker company, founded in Seattle in 1991. Genesis' original flagship system, the 1.2, retailed for US$235,000, and is basically an updated Infinity IRS system. Since the departure of Nudell, Infinity speaker designs have taken a more mass market oriented approach. The efficient SM (Studio Monitor) series incorporated a polycell tweeter and graphite impregnated midrange/woofers. While not as elaborate or high end as previous Infinity efforts, they filled a popular consumer niche.

He founded and heads the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs. Hadi was born in Nablus but has spent most of his life in Jerusalem. He holds a Ph.D. from the School of Peace Studies at the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom. He has devoted most of his life to academic research and dialogue, as well as the publication of this research with the aim of providing a deep understanding of Palestinian issues, past and present ‚Äì the land, the people, their rights and their leadership ‚Äì to interested audiences in the region and beyond. He has founded and co-founded numerous forums and institutes. For example, he co-founded the Al-Fajr Palestinian daily newspaper in 1972 as well as the Palestinian Council for Higher Education (1977‚Äì1980). Family Hadi's family roots can be traced back to the seventh century when ‚Äì according to one theory ‚Äì the Abdul Hadi family then an Arab tribe from Yemen came to Jerusalem with Umar ibn al-Khattab. Later the family used to govern the area of Nablus as well as Acre and was widely known as landlords. Until today they own large areas of property around Nablus and Jenin. During the Ottoman rule over Palestine, members of the Hadi family were not only active in government positions but also in opposition movements. Since then, the family has played a central role in Palestinian society in general and, especially, within the Palestinian national movement. Early life Hadi was born in Nablus on 22 March 1944 and spent most of his early childhood in Jaffa where his father Fouad Adbul Hadi was a landlord in Palestine (the Arabian Triangle ‚Äì Khidara). During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the family had to leave their home and they became refugees in Lebanon. Together with his two brothers, Abdul Hadi and Salameh, Mahdi Abdul Hadi joined the Jesuit St. Joseph School in Junieh, Beirut. He was taught in Beirut upon the family's return to Nablus in 1950 where his father worked as judge in the district court which had by then became part of the Jordanian Ministry of Justice. The Abdul Hadi Brothers as Refugees at the Jounieh Jesuit School, Beirut (1949) The three Abdul-Hadi Brothers in Beirut (12 July 1949) The Abdul-Hadi Brothers (Abed, Salameh, Mahdi) with their Father, Fouad Abdul-Hadi, Beirut, June 1949 Dr Mahdi Abdul Hadi with his parents Fouad Abdul Hadi and Shahira Nabulsi in Beirut 1949-05-15 Education In the following decade Hadi received his primary and secondary education at various institutions in the West Bank, such as the national Najah School (1950‚Äì1952), Ahliya School (1952‚Äì1955), the Ibn Rushd School in Hebron (1955‚Äì1957), the German Schneller School in Bethlehem (1958), the Friends Boys School in Ramallah (1959‚Äì1960), the Khalil Sakakani School in Jerusalem (1961‚Äì1962) and the Rashidiya School (1962‚Äì1963). He completed his secondary education (Tawjihi) in Cairo at the National Educational School Zamalek in Cairo (1964). Afterwards, he enrolled at law school in Damascus which he completed with a bachelor's degree in Law (1965‚Äì1970). During the time of his studies he worked as a clerk in the district court in Jerusalem under the judges Tayseer Kan‚Äôan and Fahad Abu al-Atham until Jerusalem was occupied by the Israeli army during the Six-Day War in June 1967. Subsequently, he joined the general strike by Arab lawyers protesting against the Israeli occupation in general and the annexation of Jerusalem in particular. Career After studying law at Damascus University and he started his career as a lawyer continuing the family tradition. However, realizing that the law was not the best way to confront the many challenges the Palestinians were facing, he soon moved into the realm of mass media and established, along with Yousef Nasri Naser and Jamil Hamad, Al-Fajr (the dawn) newspaper (1972). He worked as editor for Al-Fajr and published a large number of articles and editorials under an alias. After the kidnapping of Naser in 1972, Hadi felt the urge to start writing about the Palestinian question. Thus, soon after he published his first book, The Question of Palestine and Peaceful Solutions, which focused on debates, initiatives and ideas on a settlement of the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians in the period of 1934 to 1974, which was published in Lebanon. In 1977, Hadi founded the Arab Thought Forum, a Palestinian think-tank, which brought together a range of intellectuals, academics and politicians. Within the forum the group developed the idea of the National Guidance Committee and later also established it. The Committee was successful in governing Palestinian society, in terms of building consensus and harmony, breaking the ice between opposing factions and maintaining the balance between the leadership inside and outside the occupied Palestinian territories. Abdul Hadi was elected its President and functioned as such until 1980. Abdul Hadi also worked with Birzeit University (1977‚Äì1980) to set up the first Palestinian public relations office in 1977. The office was established to build a deeper and wider understanding of the political situation through the exchange of ideas and the spread of information which was undertaken via bulletins, leaflets, publications, articles and meetings between active individuals and institutions. In 1977 Abdul Hadi co-founded the Council for Higher Education in the West Bank together with Ibrahim Dakak, Gires Khouri and Gabi Baramki and served as its elected Secretary General until 1980. In 1981 he decided to continue his higher education and enrolled at the School of Peace Studies at Bradford University in the United Kingdom from where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1984 focusing his dissertation on Palestinian-Jordanian relations during the period from 1921 until 1951. In order to even further broaden his grasp of global issues, he continued his education at the Harvard Center of International Affairs where he stayed as fellow for one year (1984‚Äì1985). During this time Abdul Hadi further developed his ideas about and knowledge of international and global affairs. After becoming a special adviser of the Jordanian- Palestinian Joint Committee in Amman, Jordan, Abdul Hadi accepted the post of special adviser to the Ministry of Occupied Land Affairs (1985‚Äì1986). He used his post to publish a booklet on the affairs of the occupied territories for the Jordanian community. With the Jordanian deportation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) figure Abu Jihad and the continued crisis between the Jordanians and the Palestinians, among other reasons, Abdul Hadi resigned and returned to Jerusalem. Academics Abdul Hadi participated in many conferences, among them the Salzburg Seminar for Divided Cities - Berlin, Jerusalem, and Belfast in February 1987. The same year, together with a group of Palestinian intellectuals and academics Abdul Hadi founded the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs (PASSIA) in March 1987 to provide a forum for the free debate and analysis of a plurality of local and foreign perspectives. PASSIA is involved in four main areas. As part of its Research and Publication Programme, PASSIA has published over 120 different studies on a large diversity of subjects relevant to the Palestine question and the Palestinians, in addition to its highly popular annual diary. Another major component is the Dialogue Programme providing a venue for the presentation and discussion of a wide range of issues and viewpoints on matters of concern to Palestinians, with a focus on topical political events, interfaith issues and, most importantly, the question of Jerusalem which is a primary focus of Abdul Hadi‚Äôs interests and a core topic in PASSIA‚Äôs work. Speakers and participants at these meetings include local and foreign scholars, professionals, activists as well as representatives of political factions and the diplomatic corps. It can be said that PASSIA has proved most successful in serving as a catalyst for civic dialogue and in fostering a better understanding of Palestinian affairs - be they in the domestic or international context. A third pillar of the work undertaken by PASSIA is its Training and Education Programme, which provides a much-needed platform for Palestinian practitioners and professionals to deepen their knowledge and expertise in specific areas of international affairs and institutional/personal capacity building (with courses on strategic planning, leadership, management, and communication skills, to name a few). Furthermore, Abdul Hadi has been involved in many projects throughout the region and worldwide. In 1990 he established the Black Sea University Institute in Bucharest and was active as external lecturer at Israeli and international universities, among them the distinguished Royal College of Defence Studies in Great Britain (1992‚Äì1997). His teachings focused on the Palestinian narrative and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Together with Faisal Husseini he co- founded the Jerusalem National Committee in 1992 which later became the Jerusalem Arab Council (1993), as Abdul Hadi functioned at the Orient House under Faisal Husseini‚Äôs leadership. Also in 1995 he co-founded the EuroMeSCo Network and together with Hedra Abdul Shafi and many others created the Palestinian Council for Peace and Justice. In 2000 he was part of the founders of the Arab Team for Muslim and Christian Dialogue in Beirut and one year later became a member of the Arab Thought Forum of Prince Hassan bin Talal in Jordan (2001). In 2006 he was honored by King Albert II of Belgium with the title Commander of the Order of the Crown. Since 2009 Abdul Hadi was also active as member of Board of Trustees of the Yasser Arafat Foundation and contributed in many statements, meetings and dialogue to end the Palestinian disengagement (since 2008). In 2011 he contributed to establishing the Arab Society for Development in Jerusalem. Furthermore, he was an active member in the Palestinian independent personality team which in many sessions worked towards Palestinian reconciliation and in 2011 Abdul Hadi witnessed the official signing of the Cairo reconciliation document, or Palestinian Prisoners' Document as it is also known. Publications Abdul Hadi has published numerous articles, monographs, and essays and edited several publications, including, most recently, 100 Years of Palestinian History, A 20th Century Chronology (2001). Some other important publications include the following: *Palestine: Social Impact of the Islamist-Secularist Struggle, Carnegie Endowment, September 2006. *Sub-Regional Cooperation: The Case of the Middle East - A View from Palestine.

As of 2017, it is an independent unit or subsidiary of Samsung Electronics. Headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, Harman maintains major operations in the Americas, Europe, as well as Asia and markets its products under several brands; such as AKG, AMX, Arcam (since July 2017),stereo.de 17 July 2017, Harman kauft Arcam (German), retrieved 11 Oktober 2020.

On November 14, 2016, Harman entered into an agreement to be acquired by Samsung. It now functions as an independent subsidiary. The sale was completed on March 10, 2017.  Early history  Sidney Harman and Bernard Kardon founded the predecessor to Harman International, Harman Kardon, in 1953. Both Harman and Kardon were engineers by training and had worked at the Bogen Company, which was then the top manufacturer of public address systems. Their collaboration helped to create a new industry: high-fidelity audio. Harman bought out his partner in 1956 and then expanded Harman Kardon into an audio powerhouse, according to a biography written by the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame.  Acquisitions and expansion  Promotional vehicle at Geneva International Motor Show 2019 In the 1960s, Harman Kardon grew more prosperous and acquired other audio houses (such as JBL).http://br.harmankardon.com/history-hk-uk.html In the 1970s, Harman accepted an appointment in the Carter administration as deputy secretary of the Department of Commerce. When Harman took office in 1976 as head in charge, he sold his company to conglomerate Beatrice Foods to avoid a conflict of interest. Beatrice promptly sold many portions of the company, including the original Harman Kardon division, and by 1980 only 60% of the original company remained. After he left government in 1978, he created Harman International Industries and reacquired a number of businesses he sold to Beatrice. The company continued its growth plan with a string of acquisitions throughout the 1980s that pushed Harman International's sales from about $80 million in 1981 to more than $200 million by 1986, and then to more than $500 million by 1989. Harman International went public in 1986 with a stock offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Cash from that sale was used to, among many other purchases, buy Soundcraft, a UK producer of professional mixing boards, in 1988 and later ‚Äì Salt Lake City digital electronics producer DOD Electronics Corp. By 1994, Harman International was selling consumer audio gear under such brands as JBL, Harman Kardon, Infinity and Epicure loudspeakers, as well as professional audio systems with such brands as JBL Professional, UREI, Soundcraft, Allen & Heath, dbx, Studer, DOD, Lexicon, AKG, BSS, Orban, Quested and Turbosound (the last one now under the control of Music Group). In July 2011, Harman acquired MWM Acoustics, a privately held company that specialized in speaker and microphone technology for consumer electronics and enterprise telephony. The combination of MWM Acoustics, Branded Audio, and AKG Automotive Microphones became the Embedded Audio Business Team. Harman expanded to include lighting in 2013 with the acquisition of Martin Professional. In June 2014, Harman completed the acquisition of AMX LLC, from The Duchossois Group, bringing enterprise control and automation systems as well as audio/video switching and distributing to Harman's offerings. In March 2015, Harman acquired the automotive division of Bang & Olufsen for 145 million euros ($156 million) for the unit as well as technology license fees. The purchase didn't include Bang & Olufsen's consumer-electronics business. In 2015, recognizing the increasing role of software and services in the markets it served, Harman expanded its capabilities around cloud, mobility and analytics with the acquisitions of Symphony Teleca, a software services company based in Mountain View, CA, and Redbend, an Israeli-based provider of software management technology for connected devices, and over-the-air (OTA) software and firmware upgrading services. With these additions, Harman announced the formation of a fourth division, which they called Connected Services. In March 2016, Harman acquired the automotive cyber-security firm TowerSec. This acquisition increased Harman's competencies in the emerging automotive cyber-security field. This was evidenced by the subsequent launch of the company's '5+1 security framework' incorporating TowerSec's 'ECU shield' technology. This acquisition was notable for further demonstrating Harman's desire to expand beyond its traditional business areas of in-car audio and entertainment systems. In November 2016, Samsung Electronics decided to acquire the company for US$8 billion in cash. In December 2016, Harman International Industries Inc. invested in a startup that makes projection displays that sit in front of car windshields, signalling a new area it plans to explore under the ownership of Samsung. In February 2017, Harman International shareholders voted in favor of the acquisition by Samsung. On March 10, 2017, the acquisition was completed, with Harman becoming a Independent subsidiary of Samsung.  Private equity attempt  Harman International Industries was to delist from NYSE in Q3/2007 due to a buy-out by KKR and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners. However, as of mid September 2007, KKR announced they would back out of the deal. On the news, Harman shares plummeted by more than 24%. Coincident with the buy-out deal, Dinesh C. Paliwal was hired as company president and CEO in July 2007. Paliwal was a veteran of the corporate turn-around. During his tenure as president of U.S. operations for ABB, the heavyweight Swiss-based automation provider, the company moved from a money-losing and siloed organization to one with double digit growth, doubled its share price in one year, and saw its bond ratings upgraded by Moody's and Standard & Poors. On July 1, 2008, Sidney Harman was succeeded by Dinesh Paliwal as chairman of the board.

These obligations may be of either a legal or moral character. The notion of positive and negative rights may also be applied to liberty rights. To take an example involving two parties in a court of law: Adrian has a negative right to x against Clay if and only if Clay is prohibited from acting upon Adrian in some way regarding x. In contrast, Adrian has a positive right to x against Clay if and only if Clay is obliged to act upon Adrian in some way regarding x. A case in point, if Adrian has a negative right to life against Clay, then Clay is required to refrain from killing Adrian; while if Adrian has a positive right to life against Clay, then Clay is required to act as necessary to preserve the life of Adrian. Rights considered negative rights may include civil and political rights such as freedom of speech, life, private property, freedom from violent crime, freedom of religion, habeas corpus, a fair trial, and freedom from slavery. Rights considered positive rights, as initially proposed in 1979 by the Czech jurist Karel Va≈°√°k, may include other civil and political rights such as police protection of person and property and the right to counsel, as well as economic, social and cultural rights such as food, housing, public education, employment, national security, military, health care, social security, internet access, and a minimum standard of living. In the \\"three generations\\" account of human rights, negative rights are often associated with the first generation of rights, while positive rights are associated with the second and third generations. Some philosophers (see criticisms) disagree that the negative-positive rights distinction is useful or valid. Under the theory of positive and negative rights, a negative right is a right not to be subjected to an action of another person or group‚Äîa government, for example‚Äîusually in the form of abuse or coercion. As such, negative rights exist unless someone acts to negate them. A positive right is a right to be subjected to an action of another person or group. In other words, for a positive right to be exercised, someone else's actions must be added to the equation. In theory, a negative right forbids others from acting against the right holder, while a positive right obligates others to act with respect to the right holder. In the framework of the Kantian categorical imperative, negative rights can be associated with perfect duties while positive rights can be connected to imperfect duties. Belief in a distinction between positive and negative rights is usually maintained, or emphasized, by libertarians, who believe that positive rights do not exist until they are created by contract. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights lists both positive and negative rights (but does not identify them as such). The constitutions of most liberal democracies guarantee negative rights, but not all include positive rights. Nevertheless, positive rights are often guaranteed by other laws, and the majority of liberal democracies provide their citizens with publicly funded education, health care, social security and unemployment benefits. When negative and positive rights conflict Rights are often spoken of as inalienable and sometimes even absolute. However, in practice this is often taken as graded absolutism; rights are ranked by degree of importance, and violations of lesser ones are accepted in the course of preventing violations of greater ones. Thus, even if the right not to be killed is inalienable, the corresponding obligation on others to refrain from killing is generally understood to have at least one exception: self-defense. Certain widely accepted negative obligations (such as the obligations to refrain from theft, murder, etc.) are often considered prima facie, meaning that the legitimacy of the obligation is accepted \\"on its face\\"; but even if not questioned, such obligations may still be ranked for ethical analysis. Thus a thief may have a negative obligation not to steal, and a police officer may have a negative obligation not to tackle people--but a police officer tackling the thief easily meets the burden of proof that he acted justifiably, since his was a breach of a lesser obligation and negated the breach of a greater obligation. Likewise a shopkeeper or other passerby may also meet this burden of proof when tackling the thief. But if any of those individuals pulled a gun and shot the (unarmed) thief for stealing, most modern societies would not accept that the burden of proof had been met. The obligation not to kill--being universally regarded as one of the highest, if not the highest obligation--is so much greater than the obligation not to steal that a breach of the latter does not justify a breach of the former. Most modern societies insist that other, very serious ethical questions need come into play before stealing could justify killing. Positive obligations confer duty. But as we see with the police officer, exercising a duty may violate negative obligations (e.g. not to overreact and kill). For this reason, in ethics positive obligations are almost never considered prima facie. The greatest negative obligation may have just one exception--one higher obligation of self-defense--but even the greatest positive obligations generally require more complex ethical analysis. For example, one could easily justify failing to help, not just one, but a great many injured children quite ethically in the case of triage after a disaster. This consideration has led ethicists to agree in a general way that positive obligations are usually junior to negative obligations because they are not reliably prima facie. Some critics of positive rights implicitly suggest that because positive obligations are not reliably prima facie they must always be agreed to through contract.\\"Individual rights\\", Ayn Rand Lexicon. Nineteenth-century philosopher Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat summarized the conflict between these negative and positive rights by saying: According to Jan Narveson, the view of some that there is no distinction between negative and positive rights on the ground that negative rights require police and courts for their enforcement is \\"mistaken\\". He says that the question between what one has a right to do and who if anybody enforces it are separate issues. If rights are only negative then it simply means no one has a duty to enforce them, although individuals have a right to use any non-forcible means to gain the cooperation of others in protecting those rights. Therefore, he says \\"the distinction between negative and positive is quite robust.\\" Libertarians hold that positive rights, which would include a right to be protected, do not exist until they are created by contract. However, those who hold this view do not mean that police, for example, are not obligated to protect the rights of citizens. Since they contract with their employers to defend citizens from violence, then they have created that obligation to their employer. A negative right to life allows an individual to defend his life from others trying to kill him, or obtain voluntary assistance from others to defend his life--but he may not force others to defend him, because he has no natural right to be provided with defense. To force a person to defend one's own negative rights, or the negative rights of a third party, would be to violate that person's negative rights. Other advocates of the view that there is a distinction between negative and positive rights argue that the presence of a police force or army is not due to any positive right to these services that citizens claim, but rather because they are natural monopolies or public goods--features of any human society that arise naturally, even while adhering to the concept of negative rights only. Robert Nozick discusses this idea at length in his book Anarchy, State, and Utopia. In medicine In the field of medicine, positive rights of patients often conflict with negative rights of physicians. In controversial areas such as abortion and assisted suicide, medical professionals may not wish to offer certain services for moral or philosophical reasons. If enough practitioners opt out as a result of conscience, a right granted by conscience clause statutes in many jurisdictions (see Conscientious objection to abortion and Conscience clause in medicine in the United States), patients may not have any means of having their own positive rights fulfilled. Such was the case of Janet Murdock, a Montana woman who could not find any physician to assist her suicide in 2009. This controversy over positive and negative rights in medicine has become a focal point in the ongoing public debate between conservative ethicist Wesley J. Smith and bioethicist Jacob M. Appel. In discussing Baxter v. Montana, Appel has written: Smith replies that this is \\"taking the duty to die and transforming it into a duty to kill\\", which he argues \\"reflects a profound misunderstanding of the government‚Äôs role\\". Criticism A right to adequate nutrition requires duties to avoid stealing, but also duties to act in ways that protect or repair the delivery of the supplies. The right cannot be guaranteed by only positive duties, nor only negative duties; it needs both. Presumably, if a person has positive rights it implies that other people have positive duties (to take certain actions); whereas negative rights imply that others have negative duties (to avoid certain other actions). Philosopher Henry Shue is skeptical; he believes that all rights (regardless of whether they seem more \\"negative\\" or \\"positive\\") requires both kinds of duties at once. In other words, Shue says that honouring a right will require avoidance (a \\"negative\\" duty) but also protective or reparative actions (\\"positive\\" duties). The negative positive distinction may be a matter of emphasis; it is therefore unhelpful to describe any right as though it requires only one of the two types of duties. To Shue, rights can always be understood as confronting \\"standard threats\\" against humanity. Dealing with standard threats requires all kinds of duties, which may be divided across time (e.g. \\"if avoiding the harmful behaviour fails, begin to repair the damages\\"), but also divided across people. The point is that every right provokes all 3 types of behaviour (avoidance, protection, repair) to some degree. Dealing with a threat like murder, for instance, will require one individual to practice avoidance (e.g. the potential murderer must stay calm), others to protect (e.g. the police officer, who must stop the attack, or the bystander, who may be obligated to call the police), and others to repair (e.g. the doctor who must resuscitate a person who has been attacked). Thus, even the negative right not to be killed can only be guaranteed with the help of some positive duties. Shue goes further, and maintains that the negative and positive rights distinction can be harmful, because it may result in the neglect of necessary duties.Shue, Henry (1980). Chapters 1-2 of Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence, and U.S. Foreign Policy. Princeton University Press. James P. Sterba makes similar criticisms. He holds that any right can be made to appear either positive or negative depending on the language used to define it. He writes: Sterba has rephrased the traditional \\"positive right\\" to provisions, and put it in the form of a sort of \\"negative right\\" not to be prevented from taking the resources on their own. Thus, all rights may not only require both \\"positive\\" and \\"negative\\" duties, but it seems that rights that do not involve forced labor can be phrased positively or negatively at will. The distinction between positive and negative may not be very useful, or justified, as rights requiring the provision of labor can be rephrased from \\"right to education\\" or \\"right to health care\\" to \\"right to take surplus money to pay teachers\\" or \\"right to take surplus money to pay doctors\\".

The French were led by La Hire and Jean Poton de Xaintrailles, who were victorious. The English losses were heavy, which later included their commander, John FitzAlan, 14th Earl of Arundel.  Background  In spring 1435 the Hundred Years' War, after a few years of relative calm began to come back into a hot phase. The English armies were operating from northern France and Aquitaine. They also controlled Paris, Saint-Denis and the whole of Normandy. Nevertheless, the situation in the occupied territories for the English during the last decades had become more difficult. Although Joan of Arc was captured in 1430 and executed in 1431, it seemed to be more difficult to rule France and enforce the Treaty of Troyes. During the year 1434 the French king Charles VII increased control over the territories north of Paris, including Soissons, Compi√®gne, Senlis and Beauvais. Due to its position Gerberoy appeared as a good outpost to threaten the English occupied Normandy and even stronger to protect the nearby Beauvais of a possible reconquest. The French hoped to expand into the city already in 1432, but due to the low state revenues they could not raise sufficient troops and gave up the project at first. In spring 1435, the project was taken up again and corresponding expenditure in the defense budget was prepared. According to the writings of the canon Jean Pillet (the first historian of Gerberoy), there was a troop of 600‚Äì1800 men positioned for this, and under the command of Jean Poton de Xaintrailles and La Hire, both former commanders with Joan of Arc. They arrived secretly at Gerberoy and set to work to restore the old defenses. At this time, in Gournay-sur-Epte, Normandy (now Gournay-en-Bray in Seine- Maritime), about a dozen kilometers southwest of Gerberoy, sat an English army under the command of John FitzAlan, 14th Earl of Arundel, in motion. This should bring the city Rue, which had also been recently recaptured by the French, again under English control. The troops led material for a siege with them. Arundel reached with his troops in early May 1435 at Gournay and marched without special backup on Gerberoy, he believed only weakly defended. His troops (according to Jean Pillet about 3,000 men, but this figure is probably only a rough estimate) were certainly numerically far superior to the French troops. The Battle The Earl of Arundel appeared on May 9th before Gerberoy along with a vanguard that probably consisted of a few knights and withdrew after a brief observation of the valley, waiting for the arrival of the main English force. The French, who had followed all the action from an elevated position from Gerberoy, quickly realized that it was merely an advance party and the main force of the English army was still on the road to Gournay. Since they had not yet sufficiently recovered their strength and repaired the fortifications for the impending siege, the French decided to take the initiative and to attack the Englishmen when they were completely unprepared. A column of French cavalry under La Hire left the town, and bypassed the position of the English vanguard to launch a surprise attack on the English, as they were marching along the road to Gournay. The French cavalry arrived undetected in a place called Les Epinettes, near Laudecourt, a hamlet near Gournay, and then attacked the English main force. At the same time the rest of the garrison (the foot soldiers and archers) was under the command of Xaintrailles. This, in isolation from the rest of the troops took shelter behind a pile dwelling nearby. After it was La Hire and his horsemen attacked the English on the streets of Gournai, and heavy fighting between the two sides ensued with many English soldiers and French cavalry being killed. During the battle, the Earl of Arundel was badly wounded when a French knight stabbed the earl in his leg. When the French reinforcements appeared, the remaining English soldiers realised their situation was now hopeless and retreated to Gerberoy. During the retreat, the French cavalry continued to attack the remnants of the English Army, and despite inflicting losses on the English force, failed to break up the army's formation and were eventually driven off after suffering a number of casualties. During the retreat, the French were able to kill a large number of English soldiers; the Earl of Arundel was captured, and he later died of the injuries sustained during the battle. The losses of the English army were high and perhaps went into the hundreds, while the French army are said to have lost around twenty soldiers, although it could well have been more than thirty. Results Despite the victory, the French were unable to exploit their success and strengthen their position in Gerberoy area. The city was besieged again by the English in the wake of the French victory and was captured by the English in 1437. The French succeeded in recapturing the city in 1449. In 1451 when all of Normandy was back under French control, the city of Gerberoy lost its role as a strategic frontier post. The victory of 9th May 1435 does not appear, in spite of its remarkable results, as one of the decisive French victories of the Hundred Years' War. But it illustrates well how developed the French the military situation was after the victories of Joan of Arc.

He captained France when they won the Grand Slam in 1977, and was the manager when the side repeated the feat in 1981 and 1987. Player Fouroux, who played as a scrum half, played for his hometown team FC Auch, as a youngster and at the end of his career (1976‚Äì1980). He started as senior with US Cognac until 1970 and played for La Voulte until 1976. He made his international debut in 1972 although it took him another four years to become a regular starter, as he was in competition with another, more sober, scrum-half Richard Astre of B√©ziers. At 5 ft 3 ins tall, he was one of the smallest players ever to play international rugby. His size, combined with his supremely confident, almost arrogant, leadership style, meant that he was often compared with Napoleon Bonaparte; Bonaparte's nickname \\"the little Corporal\\" stuck with Fouroux throughout his career. He was particularly happy when the going got tough and was described as a \\"ninth forward\\". Fouroux captained France during both the 1976 and the 1977 Five Nations Championship. The 1976 Championship went well for France, their only loss came against Wales. The French highlight of the tournament was a 30‚Äì9 victory over England. The following year, which was to prove to be Fouroux's final season as an international player, saw France take the Grand Slam. Aside from a 4‚Äì3 victory over England, in which England missed a number of kickable penalties, France won their second Grand Slam fairly convincingly. The same 15 players played the 4 games from beginning to end. He also played for a World XV on 9 August 1980 against in Buenos Aires, losing 36‚Äì22.Player list for World XV Coach After retiring, having earned 27 international caps, 23 as captain, Fouroux became the coach of France shortly before the 1981 Five Nations tournament. Fouroux's appointment coincided with France's domination of the Five Nations; in the ten years that he managed the side, France won the Five Nations on six occasions. During the 1980s France's successes were based around their massive pack, a fact which upset a number of commentators in France who preferred a more technical approach. Runners-up World Cup 1987 France entered the inaugural World Cup as one of the favourites. The team progressed all the way to the final before losing 29‚Äì9 to the All Blacks. Throughout his career as both a player and a coach, Fouroux was unafraid of making enemies and upsetting people. This finally caught up with him in 1990, when an embarrassing 12‚Äì6 defeat to Romania provided a perfect excuse for the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de Rugby to give him the sack. A French championship Title private following a refereeing error with Grenoble 1993 Following this he became the coach of FC Grenoble (1992‚Äì1993), whom he took to the final of the French League in 1993 with a massive pack nicknamed the mammoths. Grenoble lost the match and Fouroux, who claimed that the game had been fixed, defected to rugby league. Despite overpowering pack Grenoble tilts on the score of 14-11. A try of Olivier Brouzet is denied to Grenoble and the decisive try by Gary Whetton was awarded by the referee, Daniel Salles, when in fact the defender Franck Hueber from Grenoble touched down the ball first in his try zone. This error gave the title to Castres. Salles admitted the error 13 years later. . Fouroux conflict with the Federation and who was already suspicious before the match of the referee cry out conspiracy. Administrator In November 1994, Fouroux announced the planned creation of a 'France Rugby League' competition, which was later abandoned in favour of a new rugby league club in Paris, to compete in Rupert Murdoch's Super League. The club, Paris Saint-Germain, only lasted two seasons in Super League before it collapsed however. In his final years, Fouroux had been working in Italy with rugby union side L'Aquila.

In 1965, his dissent with General Musa Khan, the Army Commander in Chief, over the Operation Gibraltar area contingency plans, and vetoing decisions to go on the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, eventually led to his replacement with Air Marshal Malik Nur Khan. Asghar Khan continued to serve with his rank when he was deputed as a Pakistan International Airlines's executive, until retiring in 1968. After his retirement from the military in 1968, Asghar Khan founded the Tehrik-e-Istiqlal (Solidarity Party) with a secular and centrist political program in direct opposition to the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), but failed to make any significant impact in the 1970 Pakistani general elections. From the 1970s‚Äì90s, Khan's political career focused towards the 'Dharna' or 'politics of agitation', against the elected civilian governments, and gained notability when he filed multiple lawsuits, over the Mehrangate bank scandal, against the PPP and the PML(N) at the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 1990s. During this time, Khan authored many political books, some very critical or given dissenting criticism of the Pakistan Army's involvement in national politics.

His elder brother, Brigadier Aslam Khan, was also an officer in the Pakistan Army who earned his reputation as the \\"Legend of Baltistan\\" after his participation in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947‚Äì1948, Pakistan's first war with India.Muqeet Malik, The Legend of Baltistan: Brigadier Muhammad Aslam Khan, The Nation, 21 August 2015. After his education at a boarding school, Asghar Khan was sent to attend the Royal Indian Military College in 1933 where he secured his matriculation in 1939, subsequently joining the British Indian Army in 1939. After graduating from the Indian Military Academy 1940, he gained a commission in the British Indian Army as the Second lieutenant in the Royal Deccan Horse attached to the Armoured Corps of the Indian Army in December 1940. In 1941, Lieutenant Asghar Khan was seconded to the Royal Indian Air Force, joining the No. 9 Squadron as its military adviser during the Burma fronts. In 1942, Captain Khan was transferred to the Royal Indian Air Force, where he saw actions in the first front in Burma against Japan, and flew bomber missions in the Hawker Hurricane. In 1944, Squadron Leader (Sq Ldr.) Khan later served in the second front in Burma, commanding the No. 9 Squadron alongside Sq Ldr. Arjan Singh who led the No. 1 Squadron during the aerial operations of the Arakan Campaign 1942‚Äì43. After the end of World War II in the Pacific, Sq Ldr. Khan was posted to the Ambala Air Force Station where he was assigned as the flight instructor at the Flying Instructors School until 1947. He was noted to be the first Indian to have qualified to fly the Gloster Meteor jet fighter, in the United Kingdom in 1946. During this time, Sq Ldr. Khan decided to transfer to the Pakistan Air Force and went to Great Britain to attend the RAF Staff College at Bracknell, where he graduated in 1949. He was later directed to attend the Joint Service Defence College located in Latimer, Buckinghamshire and graduated in 1952. He continued his further education at the Imperial Defence College and graduated in 1955. Command and war appointments in the Pakistani military Upon returning to Pakistan Wing Commander (Wg-Cdr.) Asghar was appointed as the first Commandant of the Pakistan Air Force Academy (then known as PAF School) in Risalpur in 1947 until 1949, he was attached to command the Peshawar Air Force base in 1949‚Äì50. In 1948‚Äì49, Wg-Cdr. Khan greeted Governor-General Muhammad Ali Jinnah when Jinnah visited the PAF Academy (then upgraded to status of a college). For a short brief of time in 1953, Group Captain (Gp-Capt.) Asghar was taken in deputation in the services of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) where he served in the corporate administration. In 1955, Gp-Capt. Khan was appointed as the commander of the No. 1 Group. In 1955‚Äì56, Air Commodore (Air-Cdre.) Khan was posted to the PAF Air Headquarters and briefly met with the Brigadier-General Saxton of the U.S. Air Force to discuss the Military Advisory Assistance Group and equipment procurement for the Pakistan Air Force. In 1957, Air Vice-Marshal (AVM) Khan was appointed as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Administration and took an initiative in establishing the Air Force Education Command that oversaw the establishment of the PAF Air War College in Islamabad and the College of Aeronautical Engineering in Risalpur. Commander-in-Chief and President of Pakistan International Airlines northern frontier of Pakistan in 2004. Ashgar Khan reportedly disapproved of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the second war with India over the Kashmir issue‚Äì later, he was replaced before that war broke out between the two nations. In 1957, the Government of Pakistan announced the retirement of the Royal Air Force's Air Vice-Marshal (AVM) Sir Arthur McDonald, and promoted AVM Asghar Khan to the two-star rank. In 1957, AVM Khan took over the command of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) as its first, and the youngest, Air Commander in the military‚Äì he was only aged 36 at the time of his promotion. In 1958, AVM Khan's rank was upgraded to three-star rank . Soon after his promotion in 1958, as Air Marshal Khan soon become involved in national politics and harboured strong feelings towards the nation's politicians involved in monetary corruption. He sided with Army Commander, General Ayub Khan against the Navy Commander, Vice-Admiral H. M. S. Choudhri over the contingency plans and management of the Joint Staff. Eventually, Khan played a crucial role in support of the 1958 Pakistani coup d'√©tat, and consolidating control in support of General Ayub Khan, alongside with Admiral A. R. Khan and the 'Gang of Four', four Air force and army generals, Azam Khan, Amir Kan, Wajid Burkk, who were instrumental in Ayub Khan's rise to the Presidency. The overthrow of President Iskander Mirza was welcomed in public circles, Air-Mshl. Khan backed the martial law enforcement which he viewed as a necessary step to eradicate the corrupt practices found in the nation's politics. In 1960, Air-Mshl. Khan was given an extension and was allowed to continue commanding the Air Force. In 1963, his second extension by approved by President Ayub Khan, which was set till 1965. During this time, Air-Mshl. Khan maintained close ties with the U.S. Air Force to continue training and supported the test pilot program where many Pakistan Air Force pilots qualified as career test pilots on U.S. military aircraft. In 1965, Air-Mshl. Khan reportedly was in conflict with the army department led by its army commander General Musa Khan when he questioned the contingency plans and secret infiltration into the Indian held side of Kashmir. Air-Mshl. Khan reported that neither the Air Force nor the Pakistan Navy was kept informed by military planners when the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 (the second war with India) broke out. Before the declaration of war by either side, Air- Mshl. Khan reportedly spoke with Air-Mshl. Arjan Singh, the Indian Air Force's Chief of the Air Staff, where both reached a mutual understanding for avoiding bombardment of each sides residential cities. Khan boldly came out against the war with India during a meeting with President Ayub Khan and correctly calculated that \\"a provoked India is likely to respond along the border in an all-out war.\\" Though, President Ayub took the war option after being convinced by the arguments presented by his Foreign Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. In August 1965, President Ayub Khan reportedly refused to approve Air-Mshl. Asghar Khan's extension papers for a third term and Khan was replaced in his command when Air Vice Marshal Nur Khan was appointed to the post. By the time Air-Mshl. Asghar was replaced from his command appointment, the Pakistan Air Force had been a formidable branch of the armed forces. After leaving command of the Air Force, President Ayub Khan appointed Ashgar Khan as the President of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) which he served with his rank. There, Khan qualified to fly commercial aircraft and obtained his commercial pilot license. Khan transformed the corporate culture into professionalism when he introduced new uniforms for the air hostesses and stewards, which earned admiration at domestic and international airports. After the deadly Pakistan International Airlines Flight 17 incident took place in 1966 involving the PIA East Pakistan Helicopter Service, Khan stressed aviation safety, which led to PIA achieving the lowest aircraft accident rate, and highest net profit of Pakistan, and was a formidable competitor in the world airline business. In addition, Asghar Khan briefly served as the Director-General of the Pakistani Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) from 1965 until retiring in 1968. His tenure as PIA President is often remembered as the \\"Golden Age of PIA\\" by his supporters. In 1968, Khan retired from military service and also left the corporate affairs of the airline. Political career in Pakistan=Solidarity Party, politics of agitation and support for martial law An example of Dharna. Asghar Khan instigated multiple Dharna movements to remove the elected civilian governments in Pakistan over the accusations of monetary corruption throughout the 1970s and 1990s. After retiring from his military service, Asghar Khan announced he was forming a political party, the Tehrik-e- Istiqlal (TeI) (lit. Movement for Solidarity Party), in response to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's announcement of the formation of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). The TeI was a centrist political party founded in direct opposition to the left-wing PPP, though both were opposing the Ayub administration. Despite its centerist and secular program, the TeI attracted the right-wing conservative vote bank and support from the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amals ultraconservative clergy. During the election campaign in 1969‚Äì70, Khan placed the blame on Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for starting the second war with India in 1965 after reading a statement from Ayub Khan after meeting the latter. He also was very critical of Bhutto and Mujibur Rahman (Mujib) when they quietly sustained the overturn of the Government of Pakistan under President Yahya Khan. He was later imprisoned alongside Bhutto and Mujib for sometime, sharing the limelight in the news for his imprisonment. In protest in 1969, Khan renounced the civil awards bestowed to him by the Government of Pakistan. He later advised President Yahya Khan on transferring the control of the government to Mujibur Rahman to prevent the breaking-up the unity of Pakistan as early as 1971. During the nationwide 1970 Pakistani general elections, Khan decided to run on the Rawalpindi's constituencies, believing that the city's population would vote in appreciation of a retired air force general who is also close to the military establishment. However, Khan clearly lost the election to the less-known politician, Khurshid Hasan Mir of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP); the Tehrik-e-Istiqlal (TeI) generally lost the election without winning any seats for the National Assembly of Pakistan as the PPP had performed well to claim the exclusive mandate in the Four Provinces of Pakistan. After the disastrous Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the third war with India, Khan joined the National Assembly, only to be served in the Opposition bench led by Wali Khan of the communist Awami National Party. After Yahya administration turned over the civilian government to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as President, Khan accused Bhutto of escalating the situation that led to the Breakup of East and West Pakistan and noting that: \\"We are living virtually under one-party state... The outstanding feature is suppression.\\" In 1973, his criticism of Prime Minister Bhutto grew further and Khan held him directly responsible for authorizing the 1970s military operations to curb nationalism in Balochistan, Pakistan. In 1974, Khan criticized the nationalization of industry in Pakistan and his party benefitted from financial support from industrialists such as Nawaz Sharif, Javed Hashmi, Shuja'at Hussain to oppose such policy measures. In 1975‚Äì76, Khan eventually supported and was instrumental in forming the National Front, a massive nine-party conservative alliance, and was said to be determined to oust Bhutto and his party from the government and power. Khan participated in the 1977 Pakistani general election on his previous constituency but lost the elections to less-known politicians, much to his surprise. He refused the election results and leveled charges on the government of vote rigging, immediately calling for the massive dharnas against the government. When provincial governments led the arrests of workers from the National Front, it was reported by historians that it was Khan who penned a letter to the Chairman Joint Chiefs Admiral Mohammad Shariff and Army Chief General Zia-ul-Haq reminding them of not to obey the law of their civilian superiors. Excerpts of this letter was later published by the historians as Khan later asking the military to renounce their support for the \\"Illegal regime of Bhutto\\", and asked the military leadership to \\"differentiate between a \\"lawful and an unlawful\\" command... and save Pakistan.\\". To the historians and observer, the letter was a pivot for the military to engage in establishing martial law against Prime Minister Bhutto in 1977. Khan was reportedly offered a cabinet post in the Zia administration but he declined to serve. Imprisonment and political struggle to maintain image After the imposing of martial law by the bloodless 5 July 1977 Operation Fair Play coup by the Army Chief, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, Khan began opposing the Zia administration and called for support for restoring democracy. On television interviews with news channels, Khan strongly defended his letter as according to him, \\"nowhere in the letter had he asked for the military to take over\\", and he had written it in response to a news story he read in which an Army Major had shot a civilian showing him the \\"V sign\\". In 1983, Khan went on to join the left-wing alliance, the Movement for Restoration of Democracy (MRD) led by Benazir Bhutto, supported by the communist parties at that time. Khan was kept under house arrest at his Abbottabad residence from 16 October 1979 to 2 October 1984 and was named a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. In 1986, Khan left the MRD, which was under the influence of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Awami National Party (ANP), and had paving a way for the Bhuttoism which had irked Khan. His decision of boycotting the non-partisan 1985 Pakistani general election eventually led to many of his party's key member defecting to the Pakistan Muslim League led by its President M. K. Junejo. In 1988, his letter calling for support for martial law became a public matter Khan and failed to defend his multiple constituencies against the PPP's politicians when the 1988 Pakistani general elections were held. He also lost the 1988 general elections and leveled accusations on the military of financing (Mehrangate) the conservative Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML(N)) and PPP. He eventually took his case to the Supreme Court of Pakistan where the hearings of his case are still being heard by the Nisar Court of present. In 1997, Khan boycotted the 1997 Pakistani general elections. Public disapproval and merging with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Since 1990, Khan's political image had failed to sustain any political influence in Pakistan. In 1998‚Äì99, Asghar Khan made unsuccessful attempts to merge his party's cause to Imran Khan's PTI. In 2002, he handed over his small party to his elder son, Omar Asghar Khan, who was a cabinet minister in the early Musharraf administration. After his son's death in 2002, Khan joined the National Democratic Party in 2004, which he remained part of until 2011. On 12 December 2011, Ashgar Khan announced his full support of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Imran Khan. He praised Imran Khan for his struggle and endorsed him as the only hope left for the survival of Pakistan. This endorsement came at a crucial time for Imran Khan, when many tainted politicians were joining his party. Dissent: Criticism on state, military and politicians During this political career, Khan was very critical of the Pakistan Army's involvement in politics and issued a strong criticism to the Pakistan Army's general, in the first instance in 1980, which led to his imprisonment‚Äì he stressed the importance of civilian control of the military for economic development. On various occasion, Khan called for normalisation of Indo-Pakistani relations and reportedly accused the Pakistan Army of inciting deliberate attempts to start the conflict with India. Khan also renounced the nuclear test operations conducted by Pakistan, targeting Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for making that decision In 2011 Khan maintained that: In 1972, Khan accused Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for the East Pakistan-West Pakistan War 1971 causing the break-up of the country, later blatantly blaming Bhutto for starting the Balochistan conflict in Western Pakistan in 1976, and the Bangladesh Liberation War in Eastern Pakistan in 1971, terming it \\"inflexible attitude\\" of Bhutto. Commenting on his political collapse, Khan accused Pakistani society for his failure, and marked that: \\"the majority in Pakistan voted for the (corrupt) politicians, as they also wanted their job done by \\"hook or by crook\\". In the 1990s, he briefly fought several legal battles against his country's elected politicians where he accused them of involved in monetary corrupt practices, and eventually filed a lawsuit against the Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League (N) in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. He held numerous televised press conferences where he attached the case file of his lawsuits and penned an article to the public: Is Hamam Main Sab Nangay‚Ä¶ (lit. Everyone's naked in this bathroom...). Khan was a prolific political writer and historian where he penned criticism on the politics of Pakistans' Army and the role of the military establishment in a country's political system. Of 13 books, three of his popular bibliography included: We've Learnt Nothing from History, Pakistan at the Crossroads and Generals in Politics. Personal life, death and funeral Asghar Khan was married to Amina Shamsie (Amina Asghar Khan) in 1946 and they had four children, Nasreen, Sheereen, Omar (deceased) and Ali Asghar Khan. Asghar Khan died on 5 January 2018, two weeks shy of his 97th birthday. The government of Pakistan buried him with full state honours and he was given a state funeral.

The kiln is one of the Six Ancient Kilns in Japan. Although figures representing the tanuki are a popular product included as Shigaraki ware, the kiln and local pottery tradition has a long history.  History  The development of kilns during the medieval period are thought to have taken place through the transformation of Sue ware technology. In the later half of the Heian period, Sue ware production came to an abrupt decline, with production now centralizing in the Owari, Mino, Bizen, and Omi provinces. Political collapse in the Heian period caused Sue ware potters to begin producing inexpensive wares such as tsubo (jars), kame (wide mouthed bowls), and suribachi (mortars or grinding). The Sue ware workshops began producing in characteristic regional blocks. All these led to the development of kilns in the region known as the ‚ÄòSix Old Kilns‚Äô. The regional blocks consisted of Seto, Echizen, Tokoname, Bizen, Tamba, and Shigaraki. The name Shigaraki describes a collective group of ceramic products made in a similar geographic area. Shigaraki ware is said to have begun when tiles were constructed for the Emperor Sh≈çmu‚Äôs Shigaraki-no-miya Palace in 742. However, evidence has shown old kiln remains in the ruins of Shigaraki village dating back to the Kamakura period and early in the Muromachi period. It is suggested that Bizen potters traveled to Shigaraki and began producing works there because early Shigaraki wares appear to have been influenced by Bizen wares. It is often hard to distinguish wares from both the Kamakura and Muromachi periods because of the embedded granules of feldspar that give both wares their striking appearance. The town of Shigaraki was formed up of eighteen independent communities along the Daido River in the valley in the most southern tip of Shiga prefecture. Three of the earliest kiln sites may date back to 1278. The communities were Kamagatani, Minami Matsuo in Nagano, and Goinoki in Koyama. These sites are suggested to have been the center of the Shigaraki industry in the old days. Shigaraki kilns were used for private enterprises. Evidence was found that the wares were first produced to meet the demands of farmers, making mortars, water urns, bottles, and deep dishes. Fragments of such wares were found in the ruins of the old kiln sites. Simple, incised, and geometric lines are also evidence that the wares were produced for everyday agricultural pursuits.  Tea ceremony  Tea drinking was common in Japan since early times. The general public drank tea out of wooden bowls at fairs and markets, and the upper classes made a guessing game with the drink. It was not until a tea master by the name of Murata Juko wrote a letter discussing the disciples of the tea ceremony that Shigaraki wares were produced for the specific ceremony. Influenced by Zen Buddhist traditions, Juko reestablished that the tea ceremony should reflect the concept of wabi-sabi, the belief of emphasizing simplicity, humility, and intense appreciation of the immediate experience. The natural appearance of this pottery helped reflect these principles and fit into the aesthetic of the tea ceremony atmosphere. The tea ceremony transformed the manner in which the Japanese viewed objects, including ceramic ware. Beginning in 1520, after Juko‚Äôs statement of tea ceremony principles, other tea masters began ordering the production of certain styles of ceramic wares for the ceremonies. Takeno Sho-o was attracted to the Shigaraki ware and ordered ware with red glazes that ran into green and brown glazes to be produced. Towards the end of the sixteenth century, the tea master Rikyu also patronized a certain appearance of wares, called Rikyu Shigaraki. These wares were made with a grey faience that imitated Korean wares. The Todo family came to power in 1635 and employed a tea master by the name of Kobori Enshu to supervise what would be later called Enshu Shigaraki ware.  Description  The local sandy clay from the bed of Lake Biwa has a warm orange color, and makes very durable pottery. This clay characterizes Shigaraki ware. The ceramics have irregular contours and an archaic flavor. Firing technique shifted from reduction to oxidation firing, which allows free admission of air during the firing rather than limited air admission into the kiln. This allows iron oxides to be used as part of the coloring process. The allowance of free air is due to the type of ancient kiln, called an anagama kiln, which is used to fire Shigaraki ware. The term anagama is a Japanese term meaning \\"cave kiln\\", as these kilns were usually constructed into the side of hills. They are single chambered structures with a sloping tunnel shape. The wood fuel must be constantly supplied in order to achieve temperatures high enough to fire the clay. Using this type of kiln also achieves the mineral glaze surface so popular with Shigaraki wares. Depending on the placement of the piece, the resulting coat of ash and minerals will vary. An oatmeal appearance is usually the result, with a greyish to a reddish-brown colorizing the body. Small impurities protrude, caused by embedded quartz partially fired. Covered with a thin layer of overrun yellowish-brown to a peach blossom red color glaze that crackles when fired is also characteristic of the fired stoneware. A light, transparent, or almost glass-like glaze with a bluish-green tint also appears on some Shigaraki wares. The glazes were dribbled, sprayed or spattered over the ceramic surface. Unless allowed to gather in small pools, the glaze appears near invisible in most lighting, only becoming visible when the piece is held and turned in the hand. The ware also reflects geta okoshi, the clog marks, where the clay rested on supports inside the kiln before firing. Another characteristic of Shigaraki ware is fingerprints left behind by potters in the construction process. Listed below are some characteristic examples of Shigaraki ware: ;Kame (wide mouthed jars) This particular vessel has paddled marks about the shoulder seam. The shoulder is then carefully scraped horizontally, while the lower body scraped vertically. It has a gray, fine-grained core and a purplish-brown glossy surface. On the shoulder, the purplish-brown color is fused with yellow ash to create an olive-green glaze. ;Tsubo (jars) This vessel has a \\"well curb\\" mark in the shape of a number sign (#) in two places on the shoulder. The neck and rim are carefully defined. The body is scraped horizontally overall. The surface has an orange color, but has no glaze finish. This example has a chevron in two places on the shoulder. The shoulder and neck are smoothed horizontally with a diagonal scraping at the shoulder line. The lower body is scraped horizontally and vertically. Fingerprints left behind from the potters occupy the base, along with two scars caused by sticks. The core is gray near the base and orange at the shoulder with a golden-orange surface. This piece is smoothed horizontally all over with a trimmed edge. It has a light gray core with a red-brown surface. A thick coat of green glaze once occupied the surface, but has now decomposed. This ware has a mark of three (san) lines on two places of the shoulder, that which is smoothed horizontally in a random manner. The lower body is scraped vertically and has an untrimmed edge. It has a light-gray core with an unglazed pinkish-beige surface. This vessel has a mark with two (ni) lines in two places upon the shoulder. The shoulder is smoothed horizontally with diagonal scratching at the seam. The lower body is scraped horizontally and vertically with an untrimmed edge. The surface is a shiny rose-red color fused with yellow ash. This piece has a mark similar to a plus sign representing the number ten (ju) in two places on the shoulder. It is smoothed both on the interior and the exterior. It also has a low edge trim. The surface is fine- grained with a red-orange color and has almost no ash on the exterior. This particular vessel has a neck in which is smoothed horizontally and the body smoothed diagonally. There is scraping just above the base. The core is gray- white and fine-grained. The surface is decomposed with a gray-white color and bubbly ash-glaze. This ware has a rim that is turned outward. The shoulder has been smoothed horizontally. The surface contains many small stones and is orange in color. ;Sake flask The flask has been smoothed horizontally on both the interior and the exterior. The lower edge is scraped. The core is a brick- red and contains many small stones. The surface is golden-beige in color.

Despite his efforts to restore the country from the ruins left by the Turco-Mongol warlord Timur's invasions, Georgia never recovered and faced the inevitable fragmentation that was followed by a long period of stagnation. Alexander was the last ruler of a united Georgia which was relatively free from foreign domination.Colin P. Mitchell. New Perspectives on Safavid Iran: Empire and Society. Taylor & Francis, 3 mrt. 2011 p 66 In 1442, he abdicated the throne and retired to a monastery.  Life  Prince Gagarin's reproduction of the Georgian King Alexander I and Queen Nestan-Darejan with other royal figures (1847). Alexander was the eldest son of Constantine I of Georgia and his wife Natia, daughter of the Georgian diplomat prince Kutsna Amirejibi. He was brought up by his grandmother (Natia's mother) Rusa (died 1413), an educated and religious noblewoman, who greatly influenced the future king‚Äôs preoccupations and his enthusiasm for religious building. With his ascension to the throne (1412), Alexander moved to western Georgia and mediated a peace between his vassals, the rival princes of Mingrelia and Abkhazia. Then he, in 1414, met the rebellious prince Atabeg Ivane Jaqeli of Samtskhe on battlefield and forced him into submission. Having dealt with these powerful feudal lords, he, aided by Catholicos Patriarch Shio II, began a program the restoration of major Georgian fortresses and churches. He imposed a temporary building tax on his subjects from 1425 to 1440, but despite the king‚Äôs efforts many towns and villages, once flourished, were left in ruin and overgrown by forest. In 1431, he re-conquered Lorri, a Georgian marchland occupied by the Kara Koyunlu Turkoman tribesmen of Persia who had frequently raided the southern Georgian marches from there and had even sacked Akhaltsikhe in 1416.According to the 15th-century Armenian historian Thomas of Metsoph (T‚Äôovma Metsobets‚Äôi), the Kara Kouynlu leader Kara Yusuf invaded Samtskhe and pillaged its capital Akhaltsikhe in 1416 in response to the profanation inflicted by the local Christian Georgians and Armenians on a mosque. Around 1434/5, Alexander encouraged the Armenian prince Beshken II Orbelian to attack the Kara Koyunlu clansmen in Syunik (Siunia) and, for his victory, granted him Lorri under terms of vassalage. In 1440, Alexander refused to pay tribute to Jahan Shah of the Kara Kouynlu. In March, Jahan Shah surged into Georgia with 20,000 troops, destroyed the city of Samshvilde and sacked the capital city Tbilisi. He massacred thousands of Christians, put heavy indemnity on Georgia, and returned to Tabriz. In order to reduce the power of frequently rebellious aristocracy, he opposed them by appointing his sons ‚Äì Vakhtang, Demetre, and George ‚Äì as his co-rulers in Kakheti, Imereti and Kartli, respectively. This, however, proved to be even dangerous to the kingdom's integrity and the fragile unity kept by Alexander would soon disappear under his sons. For this reason, Alexander the Great is frequently claimed to have disintegrated Georgia and said not to deserve his epithet \\"the Great\\" his people bestowed on him.Suny (1994), page 45 This appellation dates almost from his own day, however, and as the modern Georgian historian Ivane Javakhishvili presumes, might have been related to the large-scale restoration projects launched by the king and his initial success in the struggle with the Turkmen nomads.Ivane Javakhishvili (1982), page 243 As worldly problems overwhelmed his kingdom, Alexander abdicated the throne in 1442 and retired to a monastery under the monastic name of Athanasius.

This series was developed by Savi Media and The Nightingale Company & Rainmaker Studios with YTV Original Productions. The series was created by Jeff Hirschfield. The show consists of a mixture of live action \\"real world\\" sequences interspersed with computer-generated scenes set inside a virtual realm. In Zixx Level One, Elliott Digital used game engine LithTech to create the animation, the first time this was done for a television show.Welcome to Zixx Level One For Zixx: Level Two, the production had to move to British Columbia when Thunderbird Films Inc. joined the team. Mainframe Entertainment came on board to do the animation and IDT Entertainment, the company that owns Mainframe, took over distribution of the show. It is the first ever Mainframe series to combine live action with computer animation. The crew would stay for season three. Plot Zixx is an Intergalactic Network (simplified as the Network) agent who has crash landed onto Earth with her partner Flanngo. As luck would have it, Earth also happens to be a hotbed of activity for the evil Onccalon and the Hargokk Empire. Zixx has no intention of letting him win, so she and Flanngo need to find a way to access the Network and make sure they can get to the next level of the Keep before Onccalon's henchmen do. Level 1 Zixx and Flanngo need to find a way into the Keep, a trans-dimensional antimatter field (a cyber dimension resembling a video game), the last legacy of the ancient Gaanth race, the leaders of the Network (reminiscent of Tron). The difference is that death is permanent if they die in the keep. Reluctantly accepting the help of earthlings, Adam and Griff, the four need to move fast and finish level one of the Keep, to do so they will need to recover the six fragments of a crystal that are scattered throughout the level. When the crystal is whole and combined with the crystal base, it shows the map to the three neuropods buried deep within the level that, when solved, show the path to the next level. They must accomplish all of this before Onccalon's henchman Deeth does. Level 2 Having made it to the shifting labyrinth of level 2, Zixx and Flanngo have gotten a nice inventory upgrade, but seem to have lost their pals Adam and Griff. Finding their new Earth location outside of the Keep to be a quiet rural town called Glen River, they find themselves forming a new team composed of their new friends Riley, Meghan, and Dwayne. Zixx needs to keep one step ahead of her foes. Unlike the previous level, level 2 (resembles to Code Lyoko and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers) changes layout randomly making it difficult to find locations again. Zixx and her new team must find the key to the golden gate, the portal to the next level, but it is not as easy because the gate also shifts around. They will need to hurry and beat various new agents of the Hargokk Empire, as well as finding out that Onccalon is still alive and regenerating now they need the help of Adam and Griff. Level 3 Zixx is thrilled when her team enters Level Three intact. The challenges of Level Three turn out to be far greater than the previous levels (like ReBoot: The Guardian Code ReBoot Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad and Butt-Ugly Martians), requiring puzzle solving to gain upgrades and somewhere on this level in the Keep, Onccalon is growing ever stronger and is about to be resurrected. Only the most powerful weapon of all time can defeat Onccalon, and so the race is on to find the Sword of Gaanth, which is split into a hilt, a blade and six Vortrian gems. If they fail, then the last remaining Gaanth who resides within the sword will destroy the entire universe before Onccalon can rule it. In the end, Onccalon is destroyed by Zixx using the Gaanth, and Zixx, Flanngo and Tarphex go back to their home planet. Characters *Zixx Phunkee Zee: A smart tough Intergalactic Network agent from Halik-7 of the Aphex Galaxy. She's the last person you want to mess with; relentlessly determined, generous, resourceful and has an extremely dry sense of humour. She's a true hero and will do anything in her considerable power to defeat the Hargokk Empire. She is a stereotypical \\"loner\\", reluctant to accept help from anyone. She carries the multi-purpose APUT Network tool, which was upgraded to a Gaanthean Proton Scanner in Level 2. *Flanngo: Zixx's investigative partner and mentor for several eons, he is a cynical, wise-cracking thick-skinned detective from the same planet as Zixx. While Zixx is the brains of the pair, Flanngo is the brawn; he's fast, tenacious and like Zixx, someone you don't want to mess with. He is surly and has the appearance of a theropod dinosaur. He tends not to use inventory or weapons other than shields, preferring his natural bodily abilities. In level 1, Flanngo can't go outside the Keep, except inside Zixx's backpack, because breathing Earth's air is toxic to him. However, in Level 2, Flanngo couldn't leave the Keep until he was accidentally ejected from the Keep in the form of a teenage boy in a dragon costume. *Onccalon: The leader of the Hargokk Empire. Years ago he was destroyed in a battle with the Network, but he survived. He is somewhere inside the Keep and has been regaining his power. His followers are devoted to resurrecting him and have engaged Zixx and her team in the Keep. :In Level 2 it was revealed that Onccalon is regenerating and is more than just a pile of space goo. He is getting stronger each day as the pieces of his remains find their way to him. He has spoken in Level 2 and in Level 3, his hand was shown in a sphere where he was regenerating. Also, he can sense and feed on fear. If Onccalon is resurrected then the universe is doomed. Level 1 *Adam Frake: Bright and intuitive, 12-year-old Adam is an only child who has never known his father and lives with his uncle. His mother is an archaeologist who \\"disappeared\\" under mysterious circumstances, which Adam believes resulted from evil aliens kidnapping her. Despite being impulsive, stubborn, and volatile, he is a natural sleuth and more than capable of taking care of himself in the Keep. He and Griff were absent during season 2, however Adam made a brief appearance as a glowing ball of energy when he saved Zixx from Jayda and explained he and Griff hit a vortex when they reached Level 2. He supposedly made it home in the same episode. It is unknown if he will appear again to help Zixx or if Adam will ever find out the truth about his mother. *Griffin \\"Griff\\" Chalanchuk : A stereotypical \\"geek\\" who enjoys sci-fi and computer gaming as much as Adam, 12-year-old Griff is Adam's polar opposite in terms of personality, which also makes him the stereotypical \\"sidekick\\" character. He's level headed and cautious, patient and analytical, though he is known to be as stubborn as Adam. While he seems far too timid compared to Zixx and Adam, he has been known to show real courage and resourcefulness when it counts. *Deeth: One of the evil aliens, the leader of the Hargokk contingent on Earth. He's the one who chases down Lew, steals the crystal from Adam, and generally makes things extremely difficult for Zixx and the gang. A dedicated servant of the dark overlord Onccalon, Deeth is rabidly determined to see his master rise again and the universe enslaved. He disguised himself as a school janitor when on Earth. He was killed by the final monster when he walked into the boss room on Level 1. *Lew: A homeless man with serious mental instabilities. He seems to know more than he should, things that both Zixx and Deeth want to know. He is constantly on the run from his past, but becomes a frequent source of help and advice for Zixx and the others. *Uncle Murray: Adam's uncle, a well- meaning man who doesn't have a clue how to raise children, who has been looking after Adam since Adam's mother disappeared. He tends to be bumbling and self-absorbed, but he genuinely cares about Adam and worries that he is in denial about his mother's \\"disappearance\\". *Anna Frake: Adam's mother, a lively and dynamic archaeologist who disappeared without explanation. Adam believes that she was abducted by aliens, especially now that Zixx and Deeth have appeared. However, it is unknown what really happened to her (i.e., if she was \\"abducted by aliens\\", or if something more... \\"serious\\" happened to her). She has communicated twice to Adam, and only once has she been successful, having distracted Level One's final guardian to give an opening for Adam to defeat. *Sarah Mills: An alien mercenary employed by the Hargokks to befriend Griff to locate the clubhouse where the crystal fragments and weapons are located. She later claims to be remorseful of her actions, showing them Deeth's weapons inventory. However, she was actually trying to locate the remaining fragments but the team was suspicious and Griff used Zixx's watch to condense her, turning Sarah into a pile of goo. If Zixx makes contact with the Network, then Sarah will be detained for her crimes. Level 2 *Riley: A newcomer to the neighbourhood, 16-year-old Riley is quick, charismatic and daring. He tends to overlook crucial details and tends to be suspicious about things concerning Zixx. A natural in the Keep, his hand‚Äìeye coordination and his ability to make intuitive connections make him invaluable as the ultimate non-linear problem solver. Raised by a single mom, Riley is embarrassed by his father, a devotee of a flaky group who believes they're in contact with aliens. In Level 3, his Keep form is empowered with superstrength. *Megan: Riley's 12-year-old cousin, a sensible and incredibly bright girl who is witty and perceptive. She is calm and takes a more calculated approach to problem solving and a brilliant tactician. Although her jokes sometimes confuse Zixx, she and Zixx have a warm appreciation for each other. She has a different understanding of Flanngo than the boys, and even glimpses the soft side that exists in spite his curmudgeonly personality. In Level 3, her Keep form gains a jetpack. *Dwayne: Thirteen-year-old Dwayne is Meghan's geeky pal and a science-technology wiz. He ignores all criticism and is rather thick headed, diving head first into any situation without realizing the real danger. While he only seems to inspire annoyance (especially in Riley and Flanngo), he has proven to be as valuable as Riley and Meghan. Near the end of Level 2, Dwayne became to Key to exiting Level 2, making his Keep form golden. In Level 3, he gain a multi-use tool that enables him to translate the languages of other beings. *Jayda: Disguised as a cool, sardonic 18-year-old juice-bar girl, she's the toughest opponent Zixx has ever faced. Brilliant, manipulative and resourceful, Jayda is also utterly ruthless and can also sing. Matching wits and weapons against Zixx and her team, Jayda proves to be the most formidable foe Adam has ever faced. he was trapped in the center of Level 2 after he destroyed Sirenelle during the final test and became the guardian of level two. *Earl: A heavy metal listening mullethead with very bad taste in cars, Earl works for the enemy (while attempting to relive his teen years). He's a complete idiot with a bad temper, but he's still someone Zixx and company need to keep an eye on. He also has a pet monster called Dickenson, which can turn into a dog. Markko froze both in the Keep to try to gain Riley's trust. He made his last appearance on Boegarian Chess set with Dickenson but was knocked off and Dickenson was frozen and smashed. *Markko: A shapeshifter who works for the Hargokk Empire. He was a friend of Riley, but when they met in the Keep Markko showed his ability to shapeshift and tried to undermine the team. Markko was eventually flattened by Jayda's psychic powers due to his failures. He suddenly appeared at the Boegarian chess set as Zixx but was cast out into oblivion. *Mr. Brown: The local librarian, he's really old, really wise and he keeps giving Zixx and the gang clues. Mr. Brown turns out to be greatest adventurers the world has ever known: The Archaeologist. He promised Zixx he would locate the Gand's book, *Narnapharn: An alien that found Zixx using a communicator device by locating the high Keep activity on Earth. He arrived in a \\"one-man Bubble Ship\\" and seemingly lived in a dumpster beside a portal until Zixx came through. He is a stereotypical fanboy, changing his Keep- venturing alien as his idol. Unfortunately, he likes to trap his heroes inside the Keep by sealing the portal with his device so that he can watch them forever in action. Jayda wants to destroy him after he trapped her for eons, doing various cruel acts to him in vengeance. He was first imprisoned in a card but was later released. Zixx recently sent him to an alien rehabilitation clinic to cure his fanaticism and protect him from Jayda. *Sirenella : An entity who appears as a shimmery spirit or an apparition who possesses Meghan and other people's bodies. Her allegiances are unknown. She is the guardian ‚Äì or \\"boss\\" ‚Äì of Level Two. During battles she acts exactly like a supercomputer because she is the physical manifestation of Deep Crimson, a supposedly undefeatable program designed to play Bognorian Chess against living opponents (inspired by the real world chess supercomputer Deep Blue). However, she couldn't compete with chaos and was knocked off the set by Jayda who unwillingly took her place as the guardian of the Golden Gate. As she fell into emptiness, Sirenella shouted she was finally free. Level 3 *Dewey: Dwayne's father and owner of an electronics store. He is very cheery and hopes to win a local robotics competition. Knowledgeable about technology, he displays great interest in Zixx's intellect. *Magda and Thar: Onccalon's henchmen on Level 3, a duo of fraternal twin siblings. Magda has the appearance of an Asian girl and is able to jam inventory and cause electronic equipment to go haywire. Thar's appearance isn't certain other than he looks like a mouse or dog on Earth and can possess anyone. Their form in the Keep allows them to merge into one being, Magnathars, that is unable to jump if surrounded by enemies. In proximity to Onccalon, they are mutated and gain the ability to whenever they want. On Earth, they can leave an intangible, invisible slime that can only be detected by Zixx's Ocuscope. One of their weaknesses is actually getting wet, which causes them to become a blob of goo. *Lance Champion: A member of a race of beings who are said to have an elixir that can grant instant courage. Lance was a spokesperson on Earth who was criticized as a failure by Zixx's team, although Flaango thinks highly of him. However, it turns out that there is no elixir, merely a lie to keep their homeworld safe. In the Keep, he has the appearance of a small bat. *Tarphex Suki-Tee: One of Zixx's oldest and closest friends. He managed to find a backdoor to Level 3 after learning of Zixx's disappearance. He strongly disagrees with Zixx's alliance with humans but soon began to trust them. He has a device that can alter memories. Later on, he is discovered to be allied with Onccalon and then betrayed him and join back on Zixx team again. *Amy: The annoying daughter of Meghan's mother's best friend. She is obsessed with shopping and is a very big klutz. When she \\"accidentally\\" breaks Tarphex's communicator beyond repair, the team wonders if there is more to her than meets the eye. The Vortrium gem that illuminated hidden things, like inner desires, revealed Amy's desire to become Riley's girlfriend. She accidentally fell into the Keep, though Tarphex later erased her memory. *Merle: Earl's twin brother, who is a sales clerk in Glen River Mall, selling cell phones. Though he isn't working for Onccalon, he captures Zixx, Tarphex and Riley and traps them in his van, using interdimensional technology in an attempt to send them into a black hole. However, they return to their dimension by hotwiring his car, just as Dwayne stole his keys. They then incapacitate him and then alter his memory so that he'd take his van straight to an institute that hates loud noise.

A senior retainer of Oda Nobunaga's vassal Akechi Mitsuhide, he served Mitsuhide until the latter's death in 1582 at the hands of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He is also known as Akechi Mitsuharu. Early life and family While Hidemitsu's date of birth is not known for certain, some say he was born either sometime between 1535 and 1537, or as late as 1557. Hidemitsu was the son of T≈çyama Kageyuki (lord of My≈çchi Castle) and Miyake Takasada (lord of Hirose Castle in Mikawa Province). He first succeeded to his father, taking the name T≈çyama Kageharu (common name Rokur≈çzaemon); then he succeeded to his mother's birth family under the name Miyake Yaheiji, and then, marrying one of Akechi Mitsuhide's daughters, took the name Akechi Hidemitsu. Service to Mitsuhide and death Nanban dou gusoku (western style gusoku), Azuchi-Momoyama or Edo period, 16th - 17th century, Tokyo National Museum Following his marriage to Akechi Mitsuhide's daughter (who had been formerly married to Araki Murashige), Hidemitsu was deeply trusted by his master, and served in the vanguard of the Akechi armies frequently. He led the attack on Battle of Honn≈ç-ji which killed Oda Nobunaga, and became a legend for his rapid crossing of Lake Biwa to get from Otsu to Sakamoto on the back of his famous horse Okage after the loss of Battle of Yamazaki and the death of Mitsuhide. This scene is very often depicted in many Japanese artworks. He then performed his famous and unpredicted act of committing hara-kiri while writing a poem on a door with blood from his abdomen used as ink for his brush.'The Samurai Sourcebook': Stephen Turnbull His men set fire to Sakamoto Castle and killed their families and themselves to follow their master to the grave. While much of the Akechi clan was destroyed at Sakamoto Castle, Hidemitsu's sons Miyake Shigetoshi and T≈çyama Tar≈çgor≈ç survived. Shigetoshi served Terasawa Katataka at the Shimabara Uprising and was killed by the rebel forces under Amakusa Shir≈ç, while Tar≈çgor≈ç is remembered as the ancestor of the famous nineteenth-century political activist Sakamoto Ry≈çma. Modern References Hidemitsu appears in the Onimusha series with the name Samanosuke Akechi. After the events of Onimusha 3: Demon Siege, he takes on the name Tenkai Nankobo in Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams. \\"Sama-no-suke\\" (Â∑¶È¶¨‰πã‰ªã) was Hidemitsu's courtesy title at the Imperial Court.

He is sometimes (possibly incorrectly) referred to as Christian Druthmar or Druthmar of Aquitaine. Christian was a noted grammarian, Biblical commentator, and eschatologist. He was born in Aquitaine, southwestern France, in the early ninth century CE, and became a monk at the Benedictine monastery of Corbie. At some point in the early or mid-ninth century he was sent to the abbey of Stavelot-Malmedy in Li√®ge, to teach Bible to the monks there. It is unknown whether he died at Stavelot, returned to Corbie or was ultimately sent elsewhere. Career Christian was called the \\"Philologist\\" because of his extensive knowledge of Greek grammar and his ability to comment upon the Gospels in their original Greek. He also likely had some understanding of Hebrew.Schaff, Philip. History of the Christian Church. Volume IV: Mediaeval Christianity. A.D. 590-1073. Grand Rapids, MI, 1882. Page 172. Online as Christian Druthmar at CCEL Among Christian's works is the commentary Expositio in Matthaeum Evangelistam (\\"Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew\\"), in which he discussed (among other things) the eschatological implications of portions of that Gospel. The traditional date given for the composition of this work is 864; however, some scholars have questioned this and maintained that Christian actually lived decades earlier.Dunlop, D.M.. A History of the Jewish Khazars. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1954. . Multiple manuscripts have survived of Christian's commentary on Matthew the Evangelist's gospel, some of which were likely edited by later writers to conform with their own views. Of particular interest to, and considerable debate among, modern scholars is Christian's view of the doctrine of transubstantiation. As Philip Schaff noted: :Curiously enough, his exact language upon this interesting point cannot be now determined beyond peradventure, because every copy of the first printed edition prepared by Wimphelin de Schelestadt, Strassbourg 1514, has perished, and in the MS. in possession of the Cordelier Fathers at Lyon the critical passage reads differently from that in the second edition, by the Lutheran, Johannes Secerius, Hagenau 1530. In the Secerius text, now printed in the Lyon edition of the Fathers, and in Migne, the words are, 26:26, ‚ÄúHoc est corpus meum. Id est, in sacramento‚Äù (‚ÄúThis is my body. That is, in the sacrament,‚Äù or the sacramental sign as distinct from the res sacramenti, or the substance represented). Matt. 26:28, Transferens spiritualiter corpus in panem, vinum in sanguinem (‚ÄúTransferring spiritually body into bread, wine into blood‚Äù). In the MS. the first passage reads: ‚ÄúId est, vere in sacramento subsistens‚Äù (‚ÄúThat is, truly subsisting in the sacrament‚Äù); and in the second the word ‚Äúspiritualiter‚Äú is omitted. The Roman Catholics now generally admit the correctness of the printed text, and that the MS. has been tampered with, but insist that Druthmar is not opposed to the Catholic doctrine on the Eucharist. Christian's writings have also attracted the interest of scholars of Jewish history. A tantalizing reference exists in Christian's work to the conversion of the Khazars to Judaism, believed to have occurred in the late eighth or early ninth centuries: :At the present time we know of no nation under the heavens where Christians do not live. For [Christians are even found] in the lands of Gog and Magog -- who are a Hunnic race and are called Gazari (Khazars) [they are] circumcised and observing all [the laws of] Judaism. The Bulgars, however, who are of the same seven tribes [as the Khazars], are now becoming baptized [into Christianity].Quotes at Khazaria.com Other works attributed to Christian include Expositio Brevis in Lucam (\\"A Brief Commentary on Luke\\"; and Expositiuncula in Ioannem Evangelistam (\\"A Little Commentary on the Gospel of John.\\") Works *Expositio in Matthaeum Evangelistam *Expositio Brevis in Lucam *Expositiuncula in Ioannem Evangelistam ReferencesEditions * Huygens, R.

Early life Jones was born in the early 1950s in Yorkshire, England. He attended Keighley Secondary Technical School, and then Keighley Boy's Grammar School. Jones began kayaking in November 1965 at age 14, around the same time as his sister, Christine, who is the mother of Olympic canoeist Tim Baillie. He describes his first time on the water as an \\"exhilarating and exciting day, despite the fact that I spent more time capsizing and swimming than canoeing.\\" That winter he learned to roll. In the following years he paddled local rivers such as the Wharfe, Swale, Ure, Nidd and Lune. Early expeditions He took up slalom canoeing and took part in his first expedition in 1969. It was led by 19-year-old Jeff Slater, whilst Slater was waiting to go to Cambridge University. The group paddled the River Inn. Jones was seventeen at the time and worked \\"feverishly\\" over a five-week holiday to raise his contribution to the expedition's funds. They arrived at St. Moritz in July after a warm up in Germany and Austria, described as a \\"baptism of fire\\". On arrival at the Inn, he soon realised why it had earned the title of the hardest stretch of water in Europe ‚Äì it was in a steep gorge and from above the rapids still appeared huge. The descent lasted five days, badly damaged eight kayaks, and nearly killed one team member. In autumn 1971, Jones was an undergraduate studying medicine at Birmingham University. His life as a student appears to have consisted of juggling his studies and his canoeing. He would often miss Friday evening lectures to attend canoeing events countrywide: \\"The dedicated grind of medical study did not inspire me the way that countrywide canoeing competitions did.\\" Blue Nile and Dudh Kosi During the winter and spring of 1971/72 he planned two more trips, and in June 1972 he was appointed team manager of the British Universities Slalom and Whitewater Team, competing \\"with considerable success\\" in three international events in Europe in the summer of 1972. Within hours of completing his final exams, he set off for Austria without even knowing the results. Jones's subsequent expeditions included the Blue Nile, where local bandits were as much of a threat as the river. Mike Jones turned 21 on this expedition, huddled inside a wet sleeping bag and sleeping with a .45 Colt revolver in his hand. On his return from the Blue Nile, Jones wanted to make the first descent of the Dudh Kosi. This river, whose source lies in the Mount Everest region, falls at approximately . By comparison, the man-made 1972 Olympic slalom course at Augsburg in Germany falls at . The launch off was at a record above sea level and runs for . The team consisted of Mike Jones, Mick Hopkinson (part of the Blue Nile team), John Liddell, Rob Hastings, Roger Huyton, Dave Manby and John Gosling, the quartermaster. The expedition suffered many problems with finance and sponsorship, and several people declined any involvement as they felt the risk of dying was too great. A film ‚Äì Dudh Kosi ‚Äì Relentless River of Everest ‚Äì recorded the expedition, and it won 12 international awards in 1976. The expedition was also followed by the Observer colour magazine and featured on HTV Cardiff. The canoes used for the descent were specially designed by Graham Mackereth of Pyranha Canoes, and needed to withstand the constant punishment from river and rocks alike. Jones wrote a book entitled Canoeing Down Everest. Death Jones died in 1978 on the Braldu River which flows off K2, the world's second highest mountain, in Pakistan. All of the team from the Everest team were on the expedition plus Peter Midwood. He died whilst trying to save a companion, for which he was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal (QGM). A memorial message inscribed upon a wooden paddle was affixed to a tree nearest the spot where Jones was said to have died. In 1983, one of his colleagues went back to the site but both the tree and the memorial had been removed. After his death his parents set up a memorial fund in his name. For ten years Dave Manby organised and ran the Mike Jones Rally in Llangollen North Wales to raise money for this fund. The purpose of the fund is to promote kayaking and exploration. It is now administered by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trusts. It gives grants for travel expenses for many categories; not just adventure and exploration. It is open to anyone with a British passport.

Genetic representation can encode appearance, behavior, physical qualities of individuals. Designing a good genetic representation that is expressive and evolvable is a hard problem in evolutionary computation. Difference in genetic representations is one of the major criteria drawing a line between known classes of evolutionary computation. Terminology is often analogous with natural genetics. The block of computer memory that represents one candidate solution is called an individual. The data in that block is called a chromosome. Each chromosome consists of genes. The possible values of a particular gene are called alleles. A programmer may represent all the individuals of a population using binary encoding, permutational encoding, encoding by tree, or any one of several other representations. Tom√°≈° Kuthan and Jan L√°nsk√Ω. \\"Genetic Algorithms in Syllable-Based Text Compression\\". 2007\\\\. p. 26. Genetic algorithms use linear binary representations. The most standard one is an array of bits. Arrays of other types and structures can be used in essentially the same way. The main property that makes these genetic representations convenient is that their parts are easily aligned due to their fixed size. This facilitates simple crossover operation. Variable length representations were also explored in Genetic algorithms, but crossover implementation is more complex in this case. Evolution strategy uses linear real-valued representations, e.g. an array of real values. It uses mostly gaussian mutation and blending/averaging crossover. Genetic programming (GP) pioneered tree-like representations and developed genetic operators suitable for such representations. Tree-like representations are used in GP to represent and evolve functional programs with desired properties.A Representation for the Adaptive Generation of Simple Sequential Programs , Nichael Lynn Cramer, Proceedings of an International Conference on Genetic Algorithms and their Applications (1985), pp. 183-187 Human-based genetic algorithm (HBGA) offers a way to avoid solving hard representation problems by outsourcing all genetic operators to outside agents, in this case, humans. The algorithm has no need for knowledge of a particular fixed genetic representation as long as there are enough external agents capable of handling those representations, allowing for free-form and evolving genetic representations.

William Shakespeare competes with Shaw for the title of best playwright, which he wins. Dionysus brings Shakespeare back to the world of the living in the hope that art can save civilization. The musical was originally performed in Yale University's gymnasium's swimming pool in 1974.Interview with Stephen Sondheim, BBC Radio 3, Composer of the Week, March 26, 2010 Meryl Streep, Sigourney Weaver and Christopher Durang all participated in the production's ensemble.Green, Jesse. \\"A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to the Punch Line\\", The New York Times, June 27, 2004 The show was produced on Broadway in 2004 with the book revised by Nathan Lane and the score expanded by Sondheim.

Lane explained what drew him to expand The Frogs: \\"after September 11 ... I started to think, there's something in this piece right now. ... There's something idealistic about the notion of someone believing that the arts can make a difference. ... I found it moving, in light of what is going on in the world.\\" The new book included indirect references to George W. Bush and the Iraq War.

One actor suggests \\"the one about the man who kills his father and sleeps with his mother\\", but the other actor is in too good a mood for tragedy and they decide to perform a comedy instead. However, before they can perform, they must make a prayer offering the performance to the gods of the theatre, and instruct the audience in how to behave. Just as it looks like they are about to delay the real play further, the Chorus enters and demands that the actors start. The Actors return as Dionysus, god of wine and drama, and his slave Xanthias. Dionysus is in despair about the state of the world, and has decided to travel to Hades to bring back the great writer George Bernard Shaw, who Dionysus believes will speak to society and help with its problems. His first stop is at the house of his half-brother Heracles to gain advice on how to enter Hades. Heracles says that Dionysus should don a lion-skin and pretend to be Heracles, and instructs the rather weak-willed god in proper heroic behaviour. The lesson seems to take, although Dionysus soon reverts to his old self. Heracles also warns them of the Frogs, dangerous creatures who live on the River Styx and are terrified of change. They then travel to the Styx, where they meet the severely depressive ferryman, Charon. Charon agrees to take Xanthias and Dionysus to the Underworld, and claims that there are no Frogs on the river. Traveling on the River, Dionysus recounts the (mythologically accurate) story of his deceased wife Ariadne. When he took her to Mount Olympus to marry her, she was worried that she could not compare to the Olympian gods, he made her a crown of stars to help her look like a goddess. However, as she was only a mortal, she died soon afterwards, and Dionysus threw her crown back into the sky. He says he is glad that there are no stars in Hell. Later that night, Dionysus is awoken by a cry of \\"brek-ek-ek-ek!\\" He soon works out that the Frogs have come; they drag him out of the boat and tempt him into a life of frogdom, hopping around without any cares or worries. Although Dionysus is briefly rescued by Xanthias, the Frogs return while Xanthias is distracted, and drag Dionysus back into the water.  Act II  Dionysus climbs back on the boat drenched and covered with weeds, still quivering from his horrible confrontation with the frogs. Undaunted, Charon steers them to the dock, where Dionysus and Xanthias disembark. They run into Dionysian worshipers, but Xanthias reminds Dionysus of their mission, and they continue to the Palace of Pluto. Aeakos, keeper of the keys to the palace, sees Dionysus in his Heracles disguise and vows vengeance on the god who slew the three-headed watchdog of Hades. As Xanthias, at Dionysus's urging, dons Heracles's suit, they encounter Charisma, the beautiful handmaiden to Persephone. Mistaking Xanthias for Heracles, she invites him to a sensuous bath in hippopotamus milk. Tantalized, Dionysus takes back the lion skin and encounters Virilla, Queen of the Amazons, who accuses Dionysus (dressed again as Heracles) of stealing the girdle of her leader Hippolyte. At the height of all the confusion, Pluto enters, surrounded by the flames of Hades. Dionysus sheds his Heracles disguise, and Pluto welcomes the god with open arms, disabusing him of the misconception that Hades is a dangerous place. Dionysus tells Pluto of his plan to bring Shaw back to earth, and Pluto reveals that all the dead playwrights are banqueting at his palace at that very moment. As Pluto and Dionysus discuss the dire situation on Earth, the Greek Chorus offers ironic commentary to the audience: though serious matters are being weighed onstage, there is no cause for alarm. Following the banquet, Dionysus bursts out of the palace to proclaim the entrance of George Bernard Shaw and his loyal passel of Shavians. When William Shakespeare emerges from the palace, the philosophical tension between the two titans escalates swiftly until they almost come to blows. Dionysus defuses the situation by declaring a contest between the two playwrights. Each will address the important issues of humanity using only the words of his own writings. The supporters of Shaw and Shakespeare assemble into an arena where the verbal battle begins. Dionysus, high in his referee's chair, calls out the topics: first woman, then man, then the Life Force. Shaw and Shakespeare are pointed in their responses, Shaw delivering his pointed orations and Shakespeare responding with his poetic imagery. Grappling for a final topic (and concerned whether the people of earth will accept Shaw's rigorous social views), Dionysus calls a time-out. His deceased wife Ariadne appears, comforting her husband and advising him to follow his heart. Looking lovingly into Dionysus's eyes, Ariadne assures him that the final topic is \\"staring you in the face\\". The contest resumes, and Dionysus announces the final topic: Death. Shaw responds with a stirring passage from Saint Joan, and the crowd is hushed. Then Shakespeare speaks of death from an old man's point of view. Dionysus, wanting to hear more asks him to speak of a young man's feelings. Shakespeare's response is the song \\"Fear No More\\" from Cymbeline. The powerful poetry moves Dionysus to declare Shakespeare the winner and offer him passage to the world of the living. A disgruntled Shaw is dragged kicking and screaming from the stage as Charon the boatman announces the return trip. Xanthias, who has elected to remain in Hades with the Amazon Virilla, bids his master farewell, as the voices of Ariadne and the chorus accompany Dionysos home. Dionysus and Shakespeare arrive back at the same theatre that the actors were at in the beginning. Dionyus beckons Shakespeare to speak, and the playwright responds by calling for a new play to be written to inspire humanity. As the entire company is revealed, Dionysus steps forward and addresses the audience. He urges us to shake off lethargy, to take action to resolve the earthly problems that plague our times. And with that, his mission is complete.

A year after the Independence of Pakistan, the School of Military Engineering (SME) was established at Sialkot in 1948. Having functioned at Sialkot for over four years, SME was shifted to Risalpur in 1952. Here it grew and expanded its sphere of activity beyond the combat related training and started with dispensation of civil engineering knowledge through regular Bachelor of Engineering classes. It gradually transformed into a full-fledged and matured engineering college and was named College of Military Engineering (CME). In 1958, the institution was renamed as Military College of Engineering (MCE). In 1962 it was given the charter of self degree awarding and autonomous institution status by Government of Pakistan. In 1988 it was affiliated in with University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore for post-graduate studies. MCE also sought collaboration with well reputed Michigan State University of the United States of America. Scores of graduates have attained their higher education degrees from reputed universities in the United States and United Kingdom. After establishment of National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan (NUST) in 1995, Military College of Engineering became one of its constituent colleges.

Life and career A left-handed batsman and left-arm medium-pace swing bowler, Nourse was the mainstay of the South African Test team for more than 20 years and had a first-class cricket career of almost 40 years. He played 45 consecutive Tests from 1902 to 1924 and while his batting was dogged rather than dynamic, career figures that show only one Test century and a batting average under 30 do scant justice to his value to his team. Nourse went to South Africa as a drummer with the West Riding Regiment in 1895 and stayed there, making his first-class cricket debut for Natal two years later. In his first Test, against Australia at Johannesburg in October 1902, he scored 72, and his first Test wicket followed in the next match. Perhaps his greatest Test match was the first game of the England tour in 1905‚Äì06, when South Africa gained its first-ever victory against England. Batting at No 8 and arriving with the score at 105 for six wickets, Nourse hit an unbeaten 93 and, with a last-wicket partnership of 48 with Percy Sherwell, took South Africa to an unlikely target of 284. Nourse toured England three times, in 1907, 1912 and 1924, and went to Australia in 1910‚Äì11. At the age of 46, he scored 1928 runs on the 1924 tour. His one Test century came in 1921‚Äì22 against Australia at Johannesburg, when he scored 111; he topped the South African batting averages in that series. In other innings, he passed 50 no fewer than 15 times. In an era when South African cricket was dominated by leg break and googly bowlers, Nourse sometimes opened the bowling for the Test team and he took 41 Test wickets. He also took 43 catches. Nourse was the highest-ever scorer in South African domestic cricket, appearing for Natal from 1897 to 1925, for Transvaal for two seasons after that, and then for Western Province through to the age of 58 in the 1935-36 season, when he scored 55 against the Australians in his last first-class match. His highest first-class innings was 304 not out for Natal against Transvaal in 1920. Nourse's obituary in Wisden says that he was known for so long as \\"Dave\\" that he adopted David as his middle name in preference to William. It also gives a long list of his careers outside cricket: \\"a soldier, a railway guard, billiard marker, saloon keeper, commercial traveller, manager of an athletic outfitters and finally coach to Cape Town University\\". His son, Dudley Nourse, was also a Test cricketer who played 34 times for South Africa.

Bizarre magic (or bizarre magick) is a branch of stage magic, like stage illusions, sleight of hand, or children's magic. The major difference is that bizarre magic uses storytelling and word play to a much greater degree, and less emphasis is placed on the manual dexterity of the performer or the complexity of his equipment.Nigel Gordon, Making It Bizarre Vol 1, 1999, The Amagarion Press, Coalville, UK The experience is intended to be more akin to small, intimate theater than a conventional magic show. Presentational style Bizarre Magicians often use authentic antique or simulated artifacts to enhance their presentations. Storytelling is also employed for a greater sense of theatrical authenticity. Techniques such as these distinguish Bizarre from other types of magic performance. Max Maven has said of Bizarre Magic that it \\"references a larger magical world beyond the boundaries of the performance.\\"Maven, Max. Quoted in Burger, Eugene (1991). ‚ÄúStrange Ceremonies.‚Äù Published by Kaufman and Company, Washington D.C. (p, 38). Bizarre magick often uses horror and supernatural imagery in addition to the standard commercial magic approaches of comedy and wonder. Bizarre magic deliberately utilizes discomfort for theatrical effect.David Parr, Genii Magazine, Oct 2000 Another methodology employed in performance is the integration of storytelling enhanced by magic.What is Bizarre? Nigel Gordon 1998, The Amagarion Press, Coalville UK Bizarre Magick is often performed as close-up magic, for a few people at a time, but it can also be performed as a club show or even as a stage act, depending on the routine, the props, and the performer. History The movement of the art of Bizarre Magick began in the late 1960s with Charles Cameron and Tony \\"Doc\\" Shiels. Some of the significant artists since that time have been Tony Andruzzi (aka Maskelyn ye Mage), Eugene Burger, Christian Chelman, Robert Neale, Tony Raven and Jeff McBride. Most of the material on the subject is published privately within the Bizarre Magick community and is not readily available through normal distribution. And many of the important works were either hand-made or published on a very limited basis. So despite being relatively recent publications, many have significant collectible value. Contemporary British practitioners include Todd Landman, Iain Jay, Careena Fenton, Nick Brunger, Ashton Carter, Nik Taylor, Paul Voodini, Tracy Wise and Steve Drury. Contemporary American practitioners include Mary Tomich, Jim Magus, Paul Prater, David Parr, Vince Wilson, Prof. BC, Joe Lantiere and Vlad (Don Deich). The Sacred Riana is an Indonesian bizarre illusionist who won the second season of Asia's Got Talent in 2017 and reached the quarterfinals of season 13 of America's Got Talent in 2018. Annual events There are a few annual events focused on Bizarre Magick. The first event was the now defunct \\"Invocational\\" which started a tradition of annual gatherings in honor of the Bizarre. In Edinburgh, Scotland the annual Charles Cameron Gathering is held in October. Also in October is the Magic and Meaning Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. England's most popular convention for bizarre magicians is \\"Doomsday\\" - originally held in Dracula's favourite seaside town, Whitby, it moved to Derby in 2019. Since 2015, The East Coast Spirit Sessions is held in January in Myrtle Beach, SC. In 2018, the first annual Mid-Atlantic Bizarre Hauntings Conference was held.

From 1894 to 1897 R√∂ell headed the Dutch government as Prime Minister, (formally: chairman of the Council of Ministers) and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Early life and education R√∂ell was born in Haarlem, to Herman Hendrik, Baron R√∂ell (1806‚Äì1883), member (1842) and registrar (1843‚Äì1858) of the States of North Holland, King's Commissioner of Utrecht (1858‚Äì1860) and of North Holland (1860‚Äì1879), curator of the University of Utrecht (1859‚Äì1883), and his wife Elisabeth van de Poll (1808‚Äì1862). He attended a boarding school in Sassenheim, and later a gymnasium in Utrecht. From 1861 to 23 November 1866, he studied Roman and Contemporary Law at the University of Applied Sciences of Utrecht, after which he briefly worked as a lawyer. Political career As a former registrar of the States of South Holland, R√∂ell was familiar with the intricacies of local and regional government and water management. In 1877, he was elected into the House of Representatives for the district of Utrecht. He was re-elected in 1881 and 1884, but lost his seat to √Üneas, Baron Mackay in 1886. He became a member of the Senate for Zeeland until he won back his seat in the House from Mackay in 1888. He was re-elected again in 1891. In the House, he was concerned with various policy areas, including education, water management, health, constitutional amendment, suffrage, home affairs, Indian affairs and taxes. After the 1894 general election, R√∂ell became formateur, and formed a liberal cabinet in which he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs. He also became the chairman of the Council of Ministers, a position that would later be dubbed Prime Minister. In 1886, his cabinet greatly expanded suffrage, doubling the electorate. In 1897, after finishing his term, he stood for election to the House of Representatives again, but was not elected, and returned to the Senate one year later. In 1901, R√∂ell returned to House of Representatives for the district of Utrecht II. After his re-election in 1905, he served as President of the House of Representatives, until he lost his seat in 1909. After another stint in the Senate for North Holland, from 1910 to 1912, R√∂ell was appointed Vice-President of the Council of State. R√∂ell died on 13 July 1914 in The Hague, eight days before his 70th birthday, and was buried in the family vault in Leusden three days later. Private life R√∂ell married Jonkvrouw Eritia Ena Romelia de Beaufort (1843 ‚Äì 1910) in Utrecht on 10 September 1868. The couple remained childless.

This formation was named after a game he played against Aron Nimzowitsch in Sanremo 1930, ending with Alekhine's decisive victory. Concept The idea consists of placing the two rooks stacked one behind another and the queen at the rear. This can lead to substantial material loss for the opponent as it places considerable pressure on the \\"target\\" of the gun, especially if it is pinned (in this case it was only four moves before ). Original \\"Alekhine's gun\\" game Here is the game that spawned Alekhine's gun: :Alexander Alekhine vs. Aron Nimzowitsch, San Remo 1930: '1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. Bd2 Ne7 6.

Since then, players have learned much about using and guarding against this formation; however, some international games are still lost or won by the force of this tactic. In November 2018 it was successfully used by Ju Wenjun against Kateryna Lagno in game 4 of the FIDE Women's World Championship. The attack could have been refuted with perfect defense, but Lagno was unable to find it and resigned five moves later. Ju Wenjun went on to win the match and with it the title.

Located in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan, it grants bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in the science and engineering disciplines and is also a constituent college of the National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan. Overview The school offers fellowships and research through the Pakistan Science Foundation at the postdoctoral level and maintains a research associateship program for both civilians and military officers. While the majority retains cadets and active-duty officers active-duty officers from all branches of the Pakistan Military, Pakistan Government civilians and civilian students can also attend the school; the faculty of school are civilians employed by the Pakistan Navy. The student body and the faculty consist of both civilians and naval officers. The Air Force Institute of Aviation Technology (AFIAT) served as the same purpose. The Pakistan Army also operates College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering and Military College of Engineering also is counterpart of this institution. The school does not offer military staff or war courses but instead, the school concentrates to develop the science and technological applications for the government and the armed forces of the country. Previously, the school was referred to as PNS Jauhar but it gained university-level accreditation and was renamed as \\"Navy Engineering College\\" by the Pakistan government History The Pakistan Navy felt a need of establishing the science and engineering school to manage its engineering and science facilities apart from the using the personnel of Pakistan Army. Therefore, Defence Minister of Pakistan Admiral Afzal Rahman Khan signed Naval Order, establishing the school of naval engineering at Karachi. Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan) Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan took personal initiatives to establish the school. The Order established the courses on ordnance and gunnery, electrical engineering, radio telegraphy, naval construction and civil engineering as well as continuing the original program in marine engineering. The PNEC is intended to function as equivalent to as United States Navy's Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) where, during its time of establishment, the military faculty member of NPS also took participation to help established and courses in the school after serving as the visiting faculty member of the school. The school was first established as Officers Training Section (OTS) in 1962 as part of Pakistan Navy by then-Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan) Admiral Afzal Rahman Khan who signed the naval decree to review the role of graduate education in the Navy. In 1966, Admiral Khan gained the status of OTS and helped the school to upgrade to that of a college and given the name of \\"Pakistan Navy Engineering College\\" (PNEC). In the most 1960s, the civilian faculty was employed by Ministry of Defense (Pakistan) and the PNEC was directly affiliated with Karachi University in the same year. In 1977, the affiliation of PNEC was transferred to NED University of Engineering and Technology after the NED University's faculty joined the PNEC's engineering faculty. During this time, the military members of Navy and other branches continued to attend the college while civilians taught courses. The PNEC was shifted to its present location in 1982 and commissioned as PNS Jauhar as an independent unit of Pakistan Navy. In 1995, Pakistan Parliament passed legislation to rename the school as \\"Pakistan Navy Engineering College (PNEC)\\", making the school a constituent college of National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan (NUST) based in Rawalpindi. The college conducts undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral courses in Electrical, Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering disciplines ‚Äì leading to the award Graduate and Postgraduate Degrees by the National University of Sciences and Technology. The college awarded separate degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering up till 2010. Following the worldwide standard, the courses have been merged. The primary role of PNEC is to produce navy engineers for the Pakistan Navy and the government of Pakistan. To achieve this, it conducts degree courses in the disciplines of Mechanical, Electrical and Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering and as of today, the school has highly regarded M.S./Ph.D. programs courses in the disciplines of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering. The Pakistan Army's officers from Pakistan Army Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering (EME Corps) have done their science and engineering programs from PNEC from 1982 to 1988, during this time period Army's college of EME was rebuilding and shifting from Quetta to Rawalpindi. Since 1987, civilian students have also been enrolled in these courses each year. Apart from BS and MS/PhD degree courses, the college also provides specialized mid career courses for Navy's technical engineer and science officers after they have obtained competency certificate on board Naval service. These include courses on Marine Engineering, Weapon Systems Management and Weapons Engineering Systems, specially designed to meet the service requirements of the officers in their career. The college achieved ISO 9001 certification in May 1999 as per 1994 standard. In June 2002, the college shifted to the new quality standards for instance, the ISO 9001: 2000. It was the first college to gain ISO 9001:2000 certification in Asia.

The original was likely composed between 400 BCE and 200 CE, but its versions probably modified through about the 15th- or 16th-century. It is regarded by Hindus as an appendix to the Bhagavad Gita found in Book 6. Like it, the Anugita is one of the treatises on Dharma (ethics, moral precepts).Kashinath T Telang, The Anugita, Volume 8, Sacred Books of the East, Editor: Max Muller, Oxford (Republished by Universal Theosophy) Anugita is, in part, a retelling of some of the ethical premises of the Bhagavad Gita through legends and fables, instead of the distilled philosophy found in the Bhagavad Gita. It contains a summary by Vaisampayana who heard and remembered Krishna's conversation with Arjuna after the Mahabharata war is over. They discuss various topics on ethics and morality, as well as the nature of existence. It is one of the numerous such dialogues and debates found in the Mahabharata. The text, consisting of thirty six chapters (from XVI to LI) of its Book 14, contains many of theories found in the ancient Mukhya Upanishads. For example: * A discussion between a husband and wife on the nature of human body, rebirth and emancipation; the husband states that all deities are within the human body * A dialogue between Adhvaryu and an ascetic on animal sacrifice, that the proper sacrifice is not ritualistic but internal, of concentration of mind for the fire of knowledge; * A dialogue between a student and teacher about the highest truth; * A dialogue on just war theory, on when, how and why someone committed to ahimsa (non-violence) must use violence to prevent persistent violence and adharma.Herman Tieken (2009), Kill and be Killed: The Bhagavadgita and Anugita in the Mahabharata, Journal of Hindu Studies, Vol. 2 Issue 2 (November), pages 209-228 The Anugita contains sections on what constitutes the duties of the good human being. For example, in chapter 23, it states the best quality and the duties of the good are: Anugita exists in many versions, with 36 or less chapters, with many chapters containing overlapping content. The original is probably ancient, but the text was edited, revised, interpolated and re-organized into chapters over its history. According to F.E. Hall, states Telang, the extant north Indian version was in all probability revised in or after the 16th-century CE. The parts and terms related to castes and confusing changes in fables in some manuscripts, for example states Telang, are late medieval era interpolations. Anugita is significant because the original's ideas and ethical points of views are cited by scholars of different schools of Hindu philosophy such as the early 8th- century Adi Shankara and 15th-century Vijnanabhiksu. Scholars have discussed whether the ethical theories in Anugita were influenced by Buddhism or Jainism, or their theories borrowed from Anugita. According to Max Muller, though similar, given the evidence and the details of their respective theories, it is impossible to state either. Anugita is generally believed by scholars to be likely a much later addition to the Mahabharata, than the ancient Bhagavad Gita, and that the teachings between the two texts are quite different in their details and the philosophical foundations.Yaroslav Vassilkov (2002), The Gƒ´tƒÅ versus the Anugƒ´tƒÅ: Were Yoga and SƒÅ·πÉkhya Ever Really One?, Epics, Khilas, and Puranas: Continuities and ruptures : proceedings of the Third Dubrovnik International Conference on the Sanskrit Epics and Puranas, pages 221-230, 234-252 References=Bibliography * Kashinath Trimbak Telang (translator), The Anugita: Being a Translation of Sanscrit Manuscripts from the Asvameda Paravan of the Mahabharata, and Being a Natural Adjunct to the Bhagavad Gita, Sacred Books of the East, Volume 8 External links * Anugita, an expos√© on samkhya and yoga doctrines in the Mahabharata Guy Vincent (2006) * The Anugita, Telang's translation with footnotes, at the Internet Sacred Text Archive * (Anu Gita Explained) Michael Beloved's translation and commentary with devanagari texts and word-for-word meanings * (Anu Gita English) Michael Beloved's open English translation only Category:Ancient Indian literature Category:Sanskrit texts ","title":"Anugita"},{"id":"3559152","text":"The Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil was one of the principal railways of Brazil, uniting the states of Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo and Minas Gerais. Origins On 9 February 1855, The imperial government of Brazil signed a contract with Edward Price for the construction of the first section of a railway which had the aim of linking the court (then in the city of Rio de Janeiro) with the provinces of S√£o Paulo and Minas Gerais. It was constituted as the Companhia de Estrada de Ferro Dom Pedro II, under the directorship of Christiano Benedicto Ottoni. Works commenced on 11 June 1855 and on 29 March 1858, the 48 km gaugeA Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil ‚Äì Hist√≥rico section from Rio de Janeiro to Freguesia de Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o de Marapicu (now Queimados) was completed. At this time there were 5 stations: Campo, Engenho Novo, Cascadura (all in the city of Rio), Maxambomba (now Nova Igua√ßu) and Queimados. On 8 November the railway was extended to Bel√©m (now Japeri) at the foot of the Serra do Mar. Expansion Estrada de Ferro Dom Pedro II (1863). In 1860, the Japeri to Macacos branch was completed. On 12 July 1863 Rodeio (now Engenheiro Paulo de Frontin) was reached and, in 1864 the Para√≠ba do Sul. The first passenger train ran to Barra do Pira√≠ on 9 August 1864. After crossing the Serra do Mar the line forked with the main line going in the direction of Entre Rios (now Tr√™s Rios) and the other, the S√£o Paulo branch, heading for Porto de Cachoeira (now Cachoeira Paulista), reaching there on 20 July 1875. In Entre Rios (which was reached on 13 October 1867), the EF Dom Pedro II connected with the Estrada de Rodagem Uni√£o e Ind√∫stria (1861) which went from Petr√≥polis to Juiz de Fora. From there it went on to other municipalities of Minas Gerais, reaching Queluz de Minas (now Conselheiro Lafaiete) in 1883. The EF Central do Brasil When the Brazilian republic was proclaimed in 1889 the Estrada de Ferro Dom Pedro II was renamed Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil (officially changing on 22 November). Meanwhile the extension works continued. In 1895 the Minas Gerais tracks arrived at General Carneiro and split in the directions of Belo Horizonte and Sete Lagoas. The city of S√£o Paulo had been reached in 1890 after the incorporation of the S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro railway which connected Cachoeira to S√£o Paulo . At the close of the 20th century, the EF Central do Brasil was still being extended, mainly by the incorporation of existing lines. However, some of the branch lines were loss making, often prejudicing the profitability of the main lines. Connection to Bahia The railway arrived at Monte Azul in Minas Gerais near the border with the state of Bahia, on 10 September 1947 and in 1950 the Via√ß√£o F√©rrea Federal Leste Brasileiro from Salvador also arrived there connecting with the Central do Brasil. Final Days On 16 March 1957 the company came under the control of Rede Ferrovi√°ria Federal S.A. (RFFSA). One of the main consequences was the dividing up of various suburban systems which had been part of the Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil, the closure of unprofitable lines and the absorption of some sections into other railways. With the construction and later doubling of the Presidente Dutra motorway between S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in 1967 (competing with its most lucrative line), the railway ceased to be a major player, a process aggravated by inefficient administration in the RFFSA and the fact that railway transport had ceased to be a priority of the federal government. During the petroleum crisis of 1973 there were attempts to modernize passenger transport; like the use of Ganz-Mavag locomotives ‚Äì the so-called Hungarian train ‚Äì between 1974 and 1978 in a failed attempt to develop a fast connection between Rio and S√£o Paulo. In 1990 services between Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo and between S√£o Paulo and Belo Horizonte had all but ceased. There was an attempt to reinstate the Trem de Prata (silver train), a luxury service between the Rio and S√£o Paulo run by a private company which ran for a short while but could not compete with the air and road connections between these two cities. A sparse service continued until 1996 but these ceased with the privatization of the RFFSA. Nowadays, the suburban lines of S√£o Paulo are run by Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) and those of Rio de Janeiro by Supervia. The rest of the network was divided up between broad gauge (under the responsibility of MRS Log√≠stica) and the (under Ferrovia Centro-Atl√¢ntica (FCA)). The name \\"Central do Brasil\\" now only exists in the terminal station of SuperVia in Rio de Janeiro. This station was the setting for the film Central Station which was nominated for the best foreign language film Oscar in 1998.

The purpose of this concept is to create a reputation of Hong Kong as a top international city. This idea was formed after the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, the event that made Hong Kong a special administrative region of China. The branding features Hong Kong as a place where \\"creativity, entrepreneurship, global connectivity, security and rich diversity\\". In 2010, following a major review and public engagement exercise, BrandHK was updated, incorporating changes to its visual identity, core values, attributes and brand platform. History The idea of ‚Äúbranding‚Äù Hong Kong originated in 1997, when much attention was focused on the handover of Hong Kong to China. The handover led to concerns over Hong Kong's ability to remain as an international financial centre as well as a global city. The decision to develop BrandHK was finally taken by the Government of Hong Kong in 2000. Extensive research and consultation was undertaken in Hong Kong and internationally, leading to the choice of ‚ÄúAsia‚Äôs World City‚Äù as the brand motto that best reflects the city's traits, while a stylised dragon was considered to best represent the Hong Kong's visual identity. The Government Review in 2008 was undertaken to identify changes that had taken place in and around the city since 2001, and to incorporate those changes into the brand.  Promotions  The Government of Hong Kong has strongly promoted such branding, and has been well-known by Hong Kong people. Promotional items and banners have been seen on buses, ships, streets banners, etc.  First generation  File:HK CWB ÈäÖÈëºÁÅ£ Á∂≠Â§öÂà©‰∫ûÂÖ¨Âúí Victoria Park Á¥ÖÁáàÁ±† red lanterns night Sept-2013 Asia's World City sign.JPGBrandHK printed on red lanterns in Victoria Park File:HongKongWorldCityBanner.pngPromotional banners on the streets File:Hong Kong Brand 7020077.JPGBranding on the exterior of a boat File:Hkapt brand.JPGBranding in the Hong Kong International Airport File:Christmas in Asia's World City (3041812959).jpgBanner in the airport File:2005TIBE Hong Kong Hall sign.jpgPromotional poster captured in the Taipei International Book Exhibition Hong Kong's booth  Second generation  File:Star Ferry with Brand Hong Kong 5695.JPGBranding on the exterior of a boat File:Hong Kong Brand banner 8473.JPGPromotional banners on the streets File:HK Central Ê∞ëËÄÄË°ó Man Yiu Street footbridge banner FIA Formua E HKT ePRIX October 2016 DSC.jpgBanners on a footbridge in Central for the Hong Kong ePrix Formula E event.

In 2010, following a Government review, the dragon logo was updated, making the dragon head smaller and incorporating three streak of ribbons behind the dragon's head. It also brought a more colourful design, referring to Hong Kong's \\"diversity and dynamism\\". The blue and green ribbons symbolise the nature and sustainable environment of Hong Kong, while the red ribbon symbolises Lion Rock, indicating the spirit of the Hong Kong people.  Criticism = Design  Upon unveiling of the new-style \\"ribbon\\" logo in 2010, it was criticized that the fees paid to the branding company could not be justified by the limited updates to the logo. The article also included interview quotations from the designer of the previous brand image, who disliked the removal of the 'HK' and 'È¶ôÊ∏Ø' characters from the dragon 'flames', suggesting that the change reduced the meaning of the brand.  Branding  Despite the promotion from the government to build such image to the city, criticism has raised throughout the years. Incidents such as racist acts to ethnics minorities from police, news about Hong Kong's low city competitiveness rankings and low liveability rankings, and the intense conflicts between Hong Kong people and the Chinese government has raised doubt to such branding to the city.

The game was released for Apple II, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS systems. Initial packaging had the name of the designer, Ralph H. Bosson, over the title on the box front so as to read Ralph Bosson's UNDER FIRE!, but subsequent packaging replaced his name and read Avalon Hill's UNDER FIRE! instead. The C64 port was by Dyadic Software Associates. The game was not billed as a computer version of Squad Leader, though it did bear some similarities in that players commanded roughly company sized forces. Only three maps were available for play. The game was unique in that for each of the nine scenarios, victory was not declared at game's end. A results screen would show losses in men and equipment, and list possession of objectives, leaving the determination of \\"victory\\" to the player. An Extended Capabilities Disk was sold by Avalon Hill also, adding 56 more US, German and Russian assault guns and tanks to the game, as well as providing Japanese, British and Italian forces, with two additional maps and six more scenarios. A Second Extended Capabilities Disk also underwent initial development, bringing a campaign layer to the game, increasing the speed of play, and making use of 64K of additional memory (where available). Gameplay The player would select display options and game scale at the start of play (the map was divided into squares, which could represent a variable number of metres per square, selected by the player at the outset of the game). The display as very simple, with units represented by crude tank, halftrack, or soldier icons. The display was a very ugly 4 color output for IBM PCs and 16 Color for Apple IIs. A scenario and map were selected (with only three choices of each, for a total of nine combinations to choose from). However, forces were randomly selected for each nationality, and the player could also choose to either attack or defend, providing even more diversity to gameplay. The player also had the option of playing either a human opponent, or against a computer opponent. The game was \\"WEGO\\" in concept (the same concept later made famous by Combat Mission) in that both players entered their orders, and then watched the order resolution unfold simultaneously. The computer opponent was actually a form of artificial intelligence; in the words of the designer: \\"I attempted to create a player that would try to win, not simply fire back. The computer has been given a knowledge of small arms tactics. It will, when possible, co-ordinate its attacks.\\" Reception William Harrington of Computer Gaming World in 1985 called Under Fire! \\"highly playable\\" and predicted that the ability to construct scenarios would keep the game \\"on the cutting edge of computer war gaming in months and even years to come\\". While noting slow performance on the Apple II series, it concluded that the game was \\"a must for Apple computer wargamers\\".\\" A 1987 overview in the magazine of squad-level games approved of the graphics and documentation, and described Under Fire! as \\"exceptional in its versatility\\" but difficult to learn as a result. An overview of World War II simulations in the same issue rated the game four out of five points. A 1993 survey of wargames gave the game two-plus stars out of five, stating that \\"it does show its age\\". Compute! called Under Fire! \\"one of the best [wargames] I've ever seen\\", and stated that the game was \\"so flexible it truly lives up to Avalon Hill's boast that it's a 'War Game Construction Set'\\". It concluded that Avalon Hill and the game's author \\"have created what is sure to become a standard for computerized war games in the future\\". The game was reviewed in Issue #50 (Sep/Oct 1986) of Fire & Movement Magazine, in an article by Omar L. DeWitt: Reviews *The V.I.P. of Gaming Magazine #5 (Sept./Oct., 1986) Notes 1 Fire & Movement Magazine, Issue #50 (Sep/Oct 1986). The designer probably meant \\"small unit tactics\\" rather than \\"small arms tactics\\".

In Paris the elder Wertheimer purchased an interest in the theatrical make-up company Bourjois. Bourjois, an innovator in these products for the stage, developed the first dry rouge, an improvement over the grease laden face paint customarily used. By 1920, Bourjois had become the largest and most successful cosmetic and fragrance company in France. Not restricted to the European continent, Bourjois was an international enterprise with corporate holdings in America. Their facility in Rochester, New York manufactured and distributed the Helena Rubinstein line of face creams.\\"Chanel SA History,\\" retrieved August 3, 2012 Maintaining Bourjois as a family business, Pierre Wertheimer and his brother Paul took over the directorship of the company in 1917.Mazzeo, Tilar J., The Secret of Chanel No.5, HarperCollins, 2010, p. 95  \\"Parfums Chanel\\"  In 1924, Coco Chanel made an agreement with the Wertheimers creating a corporate entity, \\"Parfums Chanel.\\" Chanel believed that the time was opportune to extend the sale of her fragrance Chanel No. 5 to a wider customer base. Since its introduction it had been available only as an exclusive offering to an elite clientele in her boutique. Cognizant of the Wertheimer‚Äôs proven expertise in commerce, their familiarity with the American marketplace, and resources of capital, Chanel felt a business alliance with them would be fortuitous. Th√©ophile Bader, founder of the Paris department store, Galeries Lafayette, had been instrumental in brokering the business connection by introducing Pierre Wertheimer to Chanel at the Longchamps races in 1922.Thomas, Dana, \\"The Power Behind The Cologne\\", The New York Times, February 24, 2002, retrieved July 18, 2012 Bader was interested in inaugurating the sale of Chanel No. 5 in the Galeries Lafayette, distinguishing his store as the first venue to offer the fragrance to the general public. For a seventy percent share of the company, the Wertheimers agreed to provide full financing for production, marketing and distribution of Chanel No. 5.

For ten percent of the stock, Chanel licensed her name to \\"Parfums Chanel\\" and removed herself from involvement in all business operations.Mazzeo, Tilar J., The Secret of Chanel No. 5, HarperCollins, 2010, p. 95 Ultimately displeased with the arrangement, Chanel worked for more than twenty years to gain full control of \\"Parfums Chanel.\\" In 1935, Chanel instigated a lawsuit against the Wertheimers, which proved unsuccessful.http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company- histories/chanel-sa-history/ \\"Chanel SA History\\", retrieved August 2, 2012 World War II brought with it the Nazi seizure of all Jewish owned property and business enterprises, providing Chanel with the opportunity to gain the full monetary fortune generated by \\"Parfums Chanel\\" and its most profitable product, Chanel No. 5. The Wertheimers were Jewish, and in May 1941, Chanel used her position as an \\"Aryan\\" to petition German officials to legalize her right to sole ownership. Chanel was unaware that the Wertheimers, anticipating the forthcoming Nazi mandates against Jews, had taken steps to protect their interests. Prior to fleeing France for New York in 1940, they had legally turned control of ‚ÄúParfums Chanel‚Äù over to a Christian, French business man and industrialist F√©lix Amiot.

Early life As a boy he was fascinated with mechanical devices. Around the age of thirteen, he was apprenticed to a local locksmith in his hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin for a summer which led to a fascination with locks and locking devices. Later, when developing an interest in the art of stage magic, he was able to marry his skill at picking locks with those of a magician and to create an act while in his late teens. He eventually, focused more on the art of escapology although does still perform magic today. As an escape artist, Thomas Solomon has been profiled in The New York Times.The New York Times, Sunday, March 18, 2012, Metropolitan section, page 2 He has performed twice at The White House for Presidents Ronald Reagan and later George HW Bush. In 2003, Solomon had his own network television special on CH4 in Great Britain in which he escaped a titanium bank safe underwater, escaped a specially bound plastic restraint hanging from the roof of an S&M; Club in London, and a high security prison cell. Later in 2007, he shot a pilot for The History Channel in which he escaped the prison cell of Al Capone, the leg irons of Billy the Kid and the holding cell of Lee Harvey Oswald. Early Twenties and The Great Escape In Milwaukee, then Chicago, Solomon first presented \\"The Great Escape,\\" a show combining magic with one escape from a locked chain in which he demonstrated lock-picking. The nightclub, sensing potential asked Solomon to drop the magic and concentrate only on escapes. As a marketing ploy, the nightclub asked participants to bring whatever they wanted to the theatre (handcuffs, locks, and straitjackets) to challenge the magician. Over the course of three years, he suffered numerous injuries but never failed in an escape. He has performed a variation of this \\"Challenge Escape Act\\" at New York City's famed, former club, MK in the flat-iron district. Founding of Patriotic Performers, USA Thomas Solomon is co-founder of Patriotic Performers, USA in which he leads a group of performers who donate their time to entertain wounded service members from all branches of the military. Recent engagements have included Walter Reed Army Hospital, Fort Detrick, the US Marine Base in Quantico, Virginia, McGuire Air Force Base, the Wounded Warrior Unit at Fort Dix Army Base and many others. He has received numerous citations, including one from President Barack Obama, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York and Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, for his work on behalf of wounded veterans. Accomplishments and Recent Work By 2013, Solomon had escaped from more than 5500 pairs of handcuffs of all different types from all times in history. He has performed numerous underwater releases from restraints in the Hudson and East Rivers, Boston Harbor, Potomac River, Mississippi, and numerous others. He won the coveted \\"World's Greatest Escape Artist\\" award from the Academy of Magical Arts and Sciences. He performed his award-winning handcuff escape act, escaping the restraints of the Los Angeles Police Department on the televised World Magic Awards in 2000. He has accomplished hundreds of straitjacket releases, most notably an escape from the all-leather straitjacket specifically created to thwart him by Menkes Leather Works. He escaped a tightly bound straitjacket in the pouring rain hanging upside down from a tower crane 150 feet above the street in Portland, Oregon in 2006. He has performed his award-winning handcuff act (2000 World Magic Awards, PAX Television) at The Roxy, The Magic Castle, Bally's and many others. He has performed aboard ships for Royal Caribbean Cruise Line traveling throughout Bermuda and the Caribbean. In 1988 he entertained President Ronald Reagan at the White House where he escaped the handcuffs of the Uniformed Secret Service. He performed again in 1989 for President George Bush and Vice- President Dan Quayle at the White House. He has performed escapes and magic for major trade show clients, Ford Motor Company, State Farm Insurance, Procter & Gamble, Absolut Vodka, 'Winston/Salem Cigarettes, Compaq Computers, Deutsche Bank, Birdseye Frozen Foods, Black and Decker among others. He starred in the Off-Broadway show, theatre of the Macabre which played three years and more than 1700 performances in Manhattan's Greenwich Village. Recently, Solomon thrilled spectators with an underwater handcuff performance at the New York Aquarium in which members of the New York Police Department locked him in four pairs of handcuffs. In forty degree frigid water, he escaped in less than three minutes thrilling onlookers.The Brooklyn Paper, March 22‚Äì28, 2012 His escape, itself a promotion to help bring attention to the Aquarium's 100 million dollar rehabilitation was widely covered by the media. In 2011, the Society of American Magicians selected Thomas Solomon to star in the storied \\"Salute To Magic\\" which has seen some of magic's greatest names as performers. Solomon combined award-winning escapes and magic into a highly theatrical two-hour show that was reminiscent of a Broadway production. The show was performed at El Teatro‚ÄîEl Museo Del Barrio Theatre, New York City's landmark theatre on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Solomon recently performed live on the Plaza outside for Fox Television network's \\"Fox and Friends\\" in which he escaped five pairs of handcuffs in full view of the audience in under one minute.Fox and Friends, November 25, 2012 Cryptography Solomon also has a fascination with ciphers, codes and other wordplay. He is an amateur cryptographer and commented recently on an article about on-line security in Wired Magazine in which he gave his solution to making passwords more secure.Wired, February 2013 His posters, some images, his promotional decks of playing cards, DVDs and other items often contain hidden messages; some are written in cipher or code. Others are written backwards or worked in with graphics (as in the blue poster). He has used palindromes, recursive acronyms, Morse code and other devices to conceal messages, solutions to an escape, names or important dates related to the image. In a promotional picture for The History Channel taken of him on the New York City subway, there are no less than six hidden images and written messages buried within the picture.

Beginning of the 20th century.The Church of The Vernicle in Serpukhov () is a small church in the town of Serpukhov, Moscow Oblast, Russia. The church was constructed between 1893 and 1896 to a Russian Revivalist design and was funded by Serpukhov's merchant Vasily Fyodorovich Astapov. The structure graces Zanarie, a town district located on the right bank of the Nara River. The architect was Roman Klein, also responsible for the building of the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts. The altars in the side-chapels were dedicated to the Znamenie icon of the Theotokos and to the Three Fathers of the Church (John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, and Gregory Nazianzus). The bell-tower with main gates standing separately (its upper deck was destroyed during the soviet time) makes the entrance to the cemetery; there are low houses of the parish clergy near it. Iconostasis was made of zinc and overgilded; its icons represented events of the Holy Week. During the Soviet time the church was closed and lost its hipped roof and cupolas. It was used as a fish storehouse with a smoking-shed. Over 50 garages are built at the distance of five to six meters around the church. The interior still features tarnished vestiges of the original academic frescoes. Archpriest Nikolay Bogolepov, who was the minister in this church, was arrested in 1925. Another priest, Nikolay Ischenko, was executed on 23 February 1931 in Moscow. Priest Panteleimon Alekseevich Saveliev (he had served in Kashira before his arrest) was executed at the Butovski range near Moscow on 21 November 1937.

Biography  Haffadh studied Medicine in Egypt and at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland before returning to Bahrain to practise, working for the Health Ministry both as a doctor and in administration. Haffadh took over the Ministry after the previous incumbent failed to force through government reforms opposed by doctors. Haffadh was replaced in a cabinet reshuffle in September 2007 as the government sought to placate critics in the Islamist-dominated parliament and removed ministers who had clashed with MPs. Haffadh had originally tendered her resignation in April 2007 following the formation of a parliamentary commission to investigate the work of the Health Ministry. The commission (members of which included Mohammed Khalid and Jassim Al Saeedi) was given impetus after an audit of Bahrain's health services by the Canadian Council for Health Accreditation found that some Ministry staff were avoiding basic safety instructions. However, Haffadh received the backing of the Bahrain Medical Society, which opposed the parliamentary investigation, and believed that it was politically motivated, with a BMS official saying: \\"The probe committee is not investigating the ministry's irregularities and shortcomings.

History The inaugural running of the event was on 11 June 1958 at Belmont Park as the sixth event on the card that day and was won by the French bred horse, Rafty trained by the US Hall of Fame trainer Hollie Hughes in a time of 2:17. The event is named for the area on the lower tip of Manhattan Island, known as Bowling Green. In 1963 the event was moved to Aqueduct Racecourse and the distance was increased to 13 furlongs ( miles). The last running of the event at Aqueduct in 1967 is one of the more notable when Poker defeated champions Assagai and his own stablemate, the 1966 US Horse of the Year, Buckpasser who was entering the race with a fifteen race winning streak. The 1970 winner Fort Marcy would later that year be crowned US Horse of the Year and the 1972 winner Run the Gantlet was the 1971 US Champion Male Turf Horse. In 1973 the event was classified as Grade II and for several years in the late 1980s the event held Grade I status. In winning the Bowling Green Handicap on 17 June 1990 at Belmont Park, the 1989 Canadian champion With Approval set a new World Record of 2:10 for miles on turf. As of today, the record remains unmatched. The 2008 edition was replaced in its summer spot by the Man o' War Stakes. The Man o' War was moved from a fall schedule to improve turf scheduling competition. In 2015 the New York Racing Association moved the Bowling Green to Saratoga. Two mares have won this race, Drumtop in 1971 setting a new course record for the miles distance and Summer Guest in 1973. Drumtop also finished second to Fort Marcy in 1970.

Discovery Restoration of two Tarascosaurus chasing an iguanodont After having in 1988 identified an upper jaw bone found near Pourcieux as belonging to a member of the Abelisauridae,*Buffetaut, √â., Mechin, P. & Mechin-Salessy, A., 1988, \\"Un dinosaure th√©ropode d‚Äôaffinit√©s gondwaniennes dans le Cr√©tac√© sup√©rieur de Provence\\", C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris t. 306. S√©r. II: 153-158 French paleontologist √âric Buffetaut reviewed the known remains of larger theropods found in the Late Cretaceous of Europe concluding they all were of abelisaurid affinity. Most of these fossils, earlier named as Megalosaurus pannoniensis, Megalosaurus hungaricus and Megalosaurus lonzeensis, he considered to be nomina dubia because of the paucity of the material. However, when in the collection of the University of Lyon he discovered some theropod bones once excavated by an unknown collector at an escarpment of a place named Lambeau du Beausset, in the \\"syncline of Le Beausset\\" (in French: synclinal du Beausset), Buffetaut and Jean Le Loeuff named and described these in 1991 as the type species Tarascosaurus salluvicus. The generic name is derived from the Tarasque or Tarasca, a devouring monster from Occitan and Spanish folklore. The specific name refers to the Salluvii, a Gallic tribe in Antiquity inhabiting the area near Marseilles.Jean Le Loeuff and √âric Buffetaut (1991). \\"Tarascosaurus salluvicus nov. gen., nov. sp.,dinosaure th√©ropode du Cr√©tac√© sup√©rieur du Sud de la France\\" - (\\"Tarascosaurus salluvicus nov. gen., nov. sp., a theropod dinosaur from the upper Cretaceous of Southern France\\"). Geobios, 24(5): 585-594 The holotype PSL 330201 was found in the Fuvelian Beds, dating from the lower Campanian. It consists of the upper part of a thigh bone, long. PSL 330202, consisting of two dorsal vertebrae, was made a paratype; these bones may belong to the same individual. Referred was PSL 330203, a damaged tail vertebra. The femur, with an undamaged length estimated at , indicates a body length of two and a half to three metres. Some fossils from Spain were also referred to the genus. In 2003 Oliver Rauhut concluded that Tarascosaurus itself was also a nomen dubium because the material was not diagnostic.O.W.M. Rauhut , 2003, The interrelationships and evolution of basal theropod dinosaurs, Special Papers in Palaeontology 69, pp 1-213 Tarascosaurus was placed in the Abelisauridae in 1991. It was then seen as the only known abelisaurid from the Northern Hemisphere apart from Betasuchus of the Maastrichtian of the Netherlands. However, in 2003 Ronan Allain et al. concluded that the type lacked any uniquely abelisaurid traits.Ronan Allain, Xabier Pereda Suberbiola (2003). Dinosaurs of France.

History  The airport opened in July 1961 with a 1,200 m runway. It has been expanded and upgraded several times; a taxiway parallel to the runway opened in 1988, a Category 3a instrument landing system (ILS) became operational in 1995, and a new passenger terminal, 2.6 times the size of the original terminal, opened in 1998.  Terminal  Kushiro Airport has a single passenger terminal on three levels with three boarding gates. It is designed primarily for domestic flights, but has limited customs and immigration facilities for international charter arrivals.  Ground transport  A bus service runs between the Airport and town of Kushiro, taking about 25 minutes and calling at the railway station, \\"MOO\\" shopping complex and a few other locations.

It has been a feature of all civilizations since time immemorial, from the Sumerians through the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans to the present. Both ancient and modern civilizations have, through trade and conquests, borrowed foreign ideas, philosophies, and sciences, thus producing hybrid cultures and societies. The term hybridity itself is not a modern coinage. It was common among the Greeks and Romans. In Latin hybrida or ibrida refers to \\"the offspring of a tame sow and a wild boar,\\"Oxford Dictionary and by extension to the progeny of a Roman man and a non-Roman woman. The word hybridity was in use in English since the early 17th century and gained popular currency in the 19th century. Charles Darwin used this term in 1837 in reference to his experiments in cross-fertilization in plants. The concept of hybridity was fraught with negative connotations from its incipience. The Greeks and Romans borrowed extensively from other civilizations, the Egyptians and Persians in particular, and creating ipso facto hybridized cultures, but regarded unfavourably biological hybridity. Aristotle, Plato and Pericles were all opposed to racial mixing between Greeks and \\"barbarians\\" and viewed biological hybridity as a source of racial degeneration and social disorder. Similarly, within the Roman Empire, which is considered as one of the most multi-ethnic empires, cultural difference was usually integrated into the predominant culture, whereas biological hybridity was condemned. The Romans‚Äô attitudes to racial mixing hardened from the 4th century AD when Rome embraced the Christian faith. This is manifest in the Codex Theodosianus (AD365) which prohibited marriages between Christians and non-Christians, the Jews in particular, and inflicted death penalty on those who did not obey this law. Contempt for biological hybridity did not end with the fall of the Roman Empire, but continued throughout the Middle Ages and well into modern times, reaching a peak in the nineteenth century with the rise of Europe into an unrivalled imperial power. Hybridity and fear of racial degeneration caused by the mixing of Europeans and non-Europeans were major concerns in 19th century colonialist discourse prompted by racist pseudo-scientific discourses found in such works as Joseph Arthur de Gobineau's Essai sur l‚Äôin√©galit√© des races and Joseph-Ernest Renan's L‚ÄôEducation culturelle et morale. As an explicative term, hybridity became a useful tool in forming a fearful discourse of racial mixing that arose toward the end of the 18th century.Carvalheiro, Jos√©. Is the Discourse of Hybridity a Celebration of Mixing, or a Reformulation of Racial Division? A Multimodal Analysis of the Portuguese Magazine Afro. Forum: Qualitative Social Research [Online], 11.2 (2010) Pseudo-scientific models of anatomy and craniometry were used to argue that Africans, Asians, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders were racially inferior to Europeans. The fear of miscegenation that followed responds to the concern that the offspring of racial interbreeding would result in the dilution of the European race. Hybrids were seen as an aberration, worse than the inferior races, a weak and diseased mutation. Hybridity as a concern for racial purity responds clearly to the zeitgeist of colonialism where, despite the backdrop of the humanitarian age of enlightenment, social hierarchy was beyond contention as was the position of Europeans at its summit. The social transformations that followed the ending of colonial mandates, rising immigration, and economic liberalization profoundly altered the use and understanding of the term hybridity. In post-colonial discourse Hybrid talk, the rhetoric of hybridity, is fundamentally associated with the emergence of post-colonial discourse and its critiques of cultural imperialism. It is the second stage in the history of hybridity, characterized by literature and theory that study the effects of mixture (hybridity) upon identity and culture. The principal theorists of hybridity are Homi Bhabha, N√©stor Garc√≠a Canclini, Stuart Hall, Gayatri Spivak, and Paul Gilroy, whose works respond to the multi-cultural awareness that emerged in the early 1990s.Hall, Stuart. ‚ÄòNew Ethnicities‚Äô in ‚ÄòRace‚Äô, Culture and Difference, James Donald, James, and Ali Rattansi, eds. (London: Sage 1992) pp. 252-259. In the theoretic development of hybridity, the key text is The Location of Culture (1994), by Homi Bhabha, wherein the liminality of hybridity is presented as a paradigm of colonial anxiety.Bhabha, Homi K. The Location of Culture. 1994. London: Routledge. The principal proposition is the hybridity of colonial identity, which, as a cultural form, made the colonial masters ambivalent, and, as such, altered the authority of power; as such, Bhabha's arguments are important to the conceptual discussion of hybridity. Hybridity demonstrates how cultures come to be represented by processes of iteration and translation through which their meanings are vicariously addressed to‚Äîthrough‚Äîan Other. This contrasts any \\"essentialist claims for the inherent authenticity or purity of cultures which, when inscribed in the naturalistic sign of symbolic consciousness frequently become political arguments for the hierarchy and ascendary of powerful cultures.\\" This also means that the colonial subject takes place, its subaltern position inscribed in that space of iteration. The colonial subject is located in a place of hybridity, its identity formed in a space of iteration and translation by the colonizer. Bhabha emphasizes that \\"the discriminatory effects of the discourse of cultural colonialism, for instance, do not simply or singly refer to a 'person'... or to a discrimination between mother culture and alien culture...the reference of discrimination is always to a process of splitting as the condition of subjection: a discrimination between the mother and its bastards, the self and its doubles, where the trace of what is disavowed is not repressed but repeated as something different‚Äîa mutation.\\" Like mimicry, hybridity is a metonymy of presence. Hybridity opens up a space, figuratively speaking, where the construction of a political object that is new, neither the colonizer nor the Other, properly defies our political expectations. However, like Bhabha's concept of mimicry, hybridity is a doubling, dissembling image of being in at least two places at once. This turn in the effect of hybridity makes the presence of colonist authority no longer immediately visible. Bhabha includes interpretations of hybridity in postcolonial discourse. One is that he sees hybridity as a strategic reversal of the process domination through disavowal. Hybridity reevaluates the assumption of colonial identity through the repetition of discriminatory identity effects. In this way, hybridity can unsettle the narcissist demands of colonial power, but reforms its identifications in strategies of subversion that turn the gaze of the discriminated back upon the colonist. Therefore, with this interpretation, hybridity represents that ambivalent ‚Äòturn‚Äô of the subject into the anxiety-causing object of \\"paranoid classification‚Äîa disturbing questioning of the images and presences of authority\\". The hybrid retains the actual semblance of the authoritative symbol but reforms its presence by denying it as the signifier of disfigurement‚Äîafter the intervention of difference. In turn, mimicry is the effect of hybridity. First, the metonymy of presence supports the authoritarian voyeurism, but then as discrimination turns into the assertion of the hybrid, the sign of authority becomes a mask, a mockery. Although the original, theoretic development of hybridity addressed the narratives of cultural imperialism, Bhabha's work also comprehends the cultural politics of the condition of being \\"a migrant\\" in the contemporary metropolis. Yet hybridity no longer is solely associated with migrant populations and with border towns, it also applies contextually to the flow of cultures and their interactions. That critique of cultural imperialist hybridity meant that the rhetoric of hybridity progressed to challenging essentialism, and is applied to sociological theories of identity, multiculturalism, and racism. Moreover, polyphony is another important element of hybridity theory, by Mikhail Bakhtin, which is applied to hybrid discourses presented in folklore and anthropology.Kapchan, Deborah and Turner Strong, Pauline, eds. Theorizing the Hybrid. Special issue, Journal of American Folklore, vol. 112, no. 445 (1999). Criticism of hybridity theory The development of hybridity theory as a discourse of anti- essentialism marked the height of the popularity of academic \\"hybridity talk\\". However the usage of hybridity in theory to eliminate essentialist thinking and practices (namely racism) failed as hybridity itself is prone to the same essentialist framework and thus requires definition and placement. A number of arguments have followed in which promoters and detractors argue the uses of hybridity theory. Much of this debate can be criticized as being excessively bogged down in theory and pertaining to some unhelpful quarrels on the direction hybridity should progress e.g. attached to racial theory, post- colonialism, cultural studies, or globalization. Sociologist Jan Nederveen Pieterse highlights these core arguments in a debate that promotes hybridity.Nederveen Pieterse, Jan, Globalization and Culture: global m√©lange. 2004, Oxford: Rowman & Littlefield Some on the left, such as cultural theorist John Hutnyk, have criticized hybridity as politically void. Others like Aijaz Ahmad, Arif Dirlik, and Benita Parry blame Homi Bhabha for recycling obscure psychoanalytic and postmodern theories of culture and identity. Ahmad criticizes Bhabha for establishing a postcolonial theory which overlooks the material colonial context and post-independence realities of the former colonies. He writes: \\"Between postcoloniality as it exists in a former colony like India, and postcoloniality as the condition of discourse by such critics as Bhabha, there would appear to be a considerable gap\\". Dirlik follows in a similar vein, stressing the postcolonial theorists‚Äô propensity to flatten out cultural difference under the umbrella term of hybridity: \\"Africa, Caribbean, South-Asian literatures come from different places and different histories, and not merely different from France, but different from each other. It is this real sort of difference that disappears in postcolonial studies\\". In \\"Signs of our Time\\" Benita Parry discusses The Location of Culture and criticizes the \\"linguistic turn\\" in cultural studies, more particularly, Bhabha's dependence on fuzzy psychoanalytical and linguistic explanations of cultural identities, or what she calls the \\"autarchy of the signifier\\". In Postcolonial Studies: a materialist critique, she further rails against the \\"linguistic turn\\" and recommends a materialist postcolonial critique that addresses colonialism's epistemic violence within the wider context of the economic exploitation of the colonized masses by imperial capitalism. More recently, Amar Acheraiou in Questioning Hybridity, Postcolonialism and Globalization challenges Bhabha's theory of hybridity on theoretical as well as ideological and historical grounds. He criticizes Bhabha for examining hybridity from a narrow, \\"synchronic\\" perspective confined to the 19th century, instead of adopting a \\"diachronic\\" view which renders better this concept's historical depth. He also reproaches this theorist for stripping the notion of hybridity off its constitutive racial connotations and considers this as an essentialist gesture. According to him, by clearing this concept of its negative biological associations, Bhabha evades the discussion of the problematic issue of race and racism, which should, paradoxically, be a central concern in hybridity theory. He further argues that Bhabha overlooks the fact that there are still today several places across the world where for many biologically hybrids, hybridity or \\"the third space\\" often proves \\"the space of the impossible\\" rather than a site of cultural and racial emancipation. The new theory of hybridity that Acheraiou develops in this book departs from the strictly \\"cultural and spatial paradigm\\" of postcolonial theory, or what he calls \\"angelic hybridism.\\" It is a broadly historical and multi-layered form of hybridity focused on the nebulous political, economic, and ideological power structures, emancipatory as well as oppressive, which have presided over the discourse and practice of hybridity since the dawn of civilization. He calls this alternative mode of rethinking postcoloniality \\"a radical ethics of hybridity,\\" which is \\"global in scope and planetary in aspiration\\". Furthermore, he stresses that this \\"resistive planetary hybridity\\" is not \\"confined to the migrant, diasporic condition,\\" and has \\"as many centres of consciousness as geographical points of origin\\". The next phase in the use of the term has been to see hybridity as a cultural effect of globalization. For example, hybridity is presented by Kraidy as the 'cultural logic' of globalization as it \\"entails that traces of other cultures exist in every culture, thus offering foreign media and marketers transcultural wedges for forging affective links between their commodities and local communities.\\"Kraidy, Marwan Hybridity: or the cultural logic of globalization 2005, Philadelphia: Temple, Another promoter of hybridity as globalization is Jan Nederveen Pieterse, who asserts hybridity as the rhizome of culture. He argues that globalization as hybridization opposes views which see the process as homogenizing, modernizing, and westernizing, and that it broadens the empirical history of the concept. However neither of these scholars have reinvigorated the hybridity theory debate in terms of solving its inherent problematics. The term hybridity remains contested precisely because it has resisted the appropriations of numerous discourses despite the fact that it is radically malleable. For example, young Muslims in Indonesia are followers of Islam but have \\"synthesized\\" trends from global culture in ways that respect religious tradition. These include drinking non-alcoholic beer, using Koranic apps on their iPhones, and buying halal cosmetics. In anti-Western countries, youth who try to create cultural hybridity through clothing conflict with the traditional views of modesty in their religion. Conflict occurs across generations when older adults clash with youth over youth attempts to change traditions.Garc√≠a Canclini, N√©stor. Hybrid Cultures. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1990 In linguistics= Colonialism  Languages are all hybrid, in varying degrees. For centuries people borrowed from foreign languages, creating thus hybrid linguistic idioms. They did so for commercial, aesthetic, ideological and technological reasons (to facilitate trade transactions, express philosophical or scientific ideas unavailable in their original idioms, enrich and adapt their languages to new realities, subvert a dominant colonial literary canon by deliberately introducing words from the colonized peoples' idiom). Trade and colonization have been the main vehicles of linguistic hybridization across history. Since the classical conquests, both the colonizers and colonized tapped into each other's languages. The Greeks soaked up many mathematical and astronomical concepts from the Egyptians. The Romans, too, absorbed much of Greek culture and ideas. They also drew abundantly from the \\"barbarians\\". In Taktika, Arrian (92‚Äì175 AD), a Greek historian and philosopher of the Roman period, drew attention to the Romans' indebtedness to their colonial subjects, arguing that \\"the Romans have many foreign (Iberian, Celtic) terms for formations, for they used Celtic cavalry\\". In modern times, the French and British resorted to similar linguistic appropriations throughout their conquests. The French language, for example, contains over 200 Arabic and Berber words, most of which were taken up during France's colonization of Algeria. Similarly, hundreds of Indian words entered the English idiom from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. According to The Oxford English Dictionary, 900 English words are of Indian origin. Linguistic hybridity was manifest in these colonial contexts, but was acknowledged by neither the colonizers nor the colonized. More still, while these linguistic borrowings had, de facto, rendered colonial languages hybrid and therefore impure, the myth of linguistic purity and superiority, inherited from the ancient Greeks‚Äô \\"linguistic racialism\\", held firmly among the European colonizers. The Greek word ‚Äòbarbarian,‚Äô which was used to refer to non-Greek languages‚Äô inferiority, backwardness and inarticulacy, was adopted by the French since the 16th century. It was often applied to the Basque, Breton and Occitan languages and to their speakers. Abb√© Gr√©goire recommended wiping out these \\"crude idioms\\" and forcing French on the Basques, Bretons and Occitans to \\"spread enlightened ideas (...), well-being and political tranquillity\\". According to him, this would \\"banish superstition\\" and \\"simplify the mechanism of the political machine.\\" It would, above all, \\"mould the citizens into a national whole\\" In Britain, this Aristotelian view of language was revitalized by authors like Jonathan Swift, Samuel Johnson, and Matthew Arnold, who cast respectively the Irish, Scots and Welsh as \\"rude\\" and \\"backward\\", attributing these peoples‚Äô intellectual and economic \\"backwardness\\" to their \\"inferior\\" languages.  A dual dynamics  Linguistic and cultural hybridity is a \\"dual dynamics\\" which operates \\"passively\\" as well as \\"actively\\". Mikhail Bakhtin distinguished two types of hybridity: \\"organic\\" or \\"unconscious\\" hybridity and \\"intentional\\" hybridity. He defines organic hybridity as an \\"unintentional, unconscious hybridization\\" and regards it as \\"the most important mode in the historical life and evolution of all languages\\". \\"Intentional hybridization\\" consists of juxtaposing deliberately different idioms, discourses, and perspectives within the same semiotic space without merging them. Bakhtin states that the language of the novel is \\"a system of languages that mutually and ideologically interanimate each other\\". He adds: \\"the novelistic hybrid is an artistically organized system for bringing different languages in contact with one another, a system having as its goal the illumination of one language by another, the carving-out of a living image of another language\\". Further down, yet, he cautions against drawing clear-cut boundaries between these two forms of hybridity, arguing that the \\"centripetal\\" forces inherent in \\"organic hybridity\\" are also present in \\"intentional hybridity,\\" in the same way as the \\"centrifugal\\" features of \\"intentional hybridity\\" may be at play in \\"organic hybridity.\\"  The tree model  Linguistic hybridity and the case of mixed languages challenge the tree model in linguistics. For example, \\"Israeli\\" (a term for Modern Hebrew) has been argued to be a Semito-European hybrid language that \\"demonstrates that the reality of linguistic genesis is far more complex than a simple family tree system allows. 'Revived' languages are unlikely to have a single parent.\\"Zuckermann, Ghil'ad. 'Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns' in Journal of Language Contact, 2009, Varia 2, pp. 40-67. In the arts Presently, human beings are immersed in a hybridised environment of reality and augmented reality on a daily basis, considering the proliferation of physical and digital media (i.e. print books vs. e-books, music downloads vs. physical formats). Many people attend performances intending to place a digital recording device between them and the performers, intentionally \\"layering a digital reality on top of the real world.\\" For artists working with and responding to new technologies, the hybridisation of physical and digital elements has become a reflexive reaction to this strange dichotomy. For example, in Rooms by Sara Ludy computer- generated effects process physical spaces into abstractions, making familiar environments and items such as carpets, doors and windows disorientating, set to the sound of an industrial hum. In effect, the distinction between real and virtual space in art is deconstructed.Rooms by Sara Ludy TRIANGULATION BLOGDocufictions: an interview with Martin Scorsese on documentary film by Raffaele Donato at Film History: An International Journal Volume 19, Number 2, 2007 pp. 199-207) The conditions and processes known as glocalization play an important role in recent forms of hybridity in the arts, since artists commonly seek to negotiate between local and global forces. Several theoretical models have been developed to explain approaches to hybridity in the arts, a phenomenon that is especially common among artists who either identify as multicultural or see their work as situated between ‚ÄúEast‚Äù and ‚ÄúWest.‚ÄùHebert, David G. (2018). Cultural Translation and Musical Innovation: A Theoretical Model with Examples from Japan. In David G. Hebert (Ed.), International Perspectives on Translation, Education and Innovation in Japanese and Korean Societies. Cham: Springer, p.309-331. Such developments demonstrate ways that the arts can both forecast and respond to changing conditions in society.

It is a constituent college of the National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan, Islamabad. MCS consists of two engineering departments. The college puts a strong emphasis on scientific and technological education and research. It is located in the heart of Rawalpindi on Humayun Road (Lalkurti) and Adiala Road, close to the General Headquarters and Combined Military Hospital. The College is approximately 5 kilometres from the Benazir Bhutto International Airport and 3 kilometers from the Rawalpindi Railway Station. Prime shopping center of Saddar is about 2 kilometers from the college. History The famous Humayun Road entrance of the college. Military College of Signals was raised immediately after partition of the Indo-Pak Subcontinent in 1947 as \\"School of Signals\\", with the task of training officers and selected Non-Commissioned Officers of the Corps of Signals of Pakistan Army. The School had to be raised from a scratch because the signal training facilities of undivided Indian Army were located either at Poona or Jabalpur which became a part of India at the time of independence. Lt Col C.W.M. Young, a British officer of the Royal Corps of Signals was the first commandant of the school. During the early years, due to the shortage of training facilities in the country in the field of telecommunication, a number of officers were trained at School of Signals, UK and subsequently at US Army Signal School at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. The College, since its raising has undergone various phases of expansion to meet the requirements of the Corps of Signals. The status of the school was raised to that of a college in 1977 when it was affiliated with University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore for Telecommunication Engineering degree program. The college became a constituent campus of National University of Sciences and Technology in 1991 and since then it has progressed phenomenally as a center of quality education. Today the curriculum is not only confined to merely undergraduate level but also MS and PhD level. Campus life The college has kept military traditions alive. Military rules are applied and National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan (NUST) policy is followed too. It provides opportunities to participate in a variety of co-curricular activities. There are students' societies and clubs which organize different activities. Presently, the college has two societies. Both were established in June 2001. *Telecom Society comprises the President, General Secretary, Treasurer, Project Coordinator and Media Coordinator. Elections are held every year. *Software Society comprises the President(Ismaeel Moeen, Vice President, General Secretary, General Manager, Girls Representative, Extra-Curricular Activities Manager, Sports Manager, Finance Secretary, Event Secretary and EIT. This society on one hand has generated various extra curricular activities while on the other by organizing different seminars, workshops, lectures and short duration courses has contributed effectively to the academic development. Companies (Dorms) There are two Companies for GC's, Jinnah Company and the Iqbal Company while Fatima Company is for civilian female students. GK hostel for civilian male students. Organization and administration The College of Signals is functionally and administratively controlled by the General Headquarters through Signals Directorate. It is headed by Major General/ Brigadier and is sub-divided into four functional groups. *Administrative Wing (Adm Wing) Comprises Administrative Branch (Administration and Quartering Sections), Training Branch, NUST Branch, Examination Branch and MCS Training Battalion. *Combat Wing (Cbt Wing) Comprises Tactical Branch, Telecommunication Branch, Security and Research Branch and Information Technology Branch. *Engineering Wing (Engg Wing) Comprises Electrical Engineering, Computer Software Engineering, Information Security, Humanities and Basic Sciences Departments and Library. *Research and Development Wing (R&D;) Mostly focuses on research and development activities of the college. Academics=Undergraduate program MCS offers undergraduate degrees in two streams namely Electrical Engineering and Software Engineering.http://nust.edu.pk/INSTITUTIONS/Colleges/MCS/ap/ug/Pages/default.aspx Before 2019 batch, only Electrical Engineering in Telecommunication was offered. The program has now been converted to full Electrical Engineering. Each year a standard NET (NUST Entrance Test) is conducted for the undergraduate enrollment in these courses. The students are also enrolled via SAT subject tests. Some students are also selected as Gentlemen Cadets of Pakistan army through ISSB. Moreover, wards of army personnel are also selected as PC's(Paying Cadets) and ASC's (Additional Selected Cadets). Graduate program The college also offers master degrees in Electrical (Telecommunication) Engineering, Software Engineering, Information Security and Systems Engineering. The master degrees also lead to PhD.http://nust.edu.pk/INSTITUTIONS/Colleges/MCS/ap/pg/Pages/default.aspx Students are enrolled after passing the GAT (Graduate Assessment Test). Departments The college has four departments.http://nust.edu.pk/INSTITUTIONS/Colleges/MCS/Departments/Pages/default.aspx *Department of Computer Software Engineering (al-Khawarizmi Block) *Department of Electrical Engineering (Shuja ul Qamar Block) *Department of Information Security *Department of Humanities and Basic Sciences (Sharif Block), named after a veteran Signals Officer Major Sharif, who was also father of Major Shabbir Sharif, who received Nishan-e-Haider(the Highest Military Award of Gallantry) and Ex-Pakistan Army Chief General Raheel Sharif. People=Students There are seven different categories of students at college. *Officers Pak Army Captains having served at least three and a half year after passing out from Pakistan Military Academy. *Gentleman Cadets (GC's) Students who are enrolled in Pakistan Army. They enter the college after qualifying the ISSB Armed Forces selection test. Upon graduation from the college, the students spend one year at the Pakistan Military Academy to receive officer ranks. They undergo strict military training. They were also referred to as \\"Technical Cadets\\". *NUST Cadets (NC's) Civilian students selected through the NUST entrance test. They do not undergo any sort of military training. *Paying Cadets (PC's) The wards of serving military personnel are given a chance to come and study at MCS. They are the \\"Paying Cadets\\".They have to undergo military trainning and join Pakistan army as a captain for at least 3 years. *Outreach Scholarship Cadets (OSPC's) Civilian students selected through the National ICT R&D; Fund's Scholarship entrance test. These students achieve fully funded merit scholarship for 4 year degree program. They also do not undergo any sort of military training. *Additional Selected Cadets (ASC's) This category is an extension of PC scheme. The cadet should be a ward of a retired or a serving military personnel. There are about 20-25 ASC reserved seats at MCS. *Foreign Cadets (FC's) In addition, MCS also offers a limited number of seats to the international students. These cadets are mostly from Middle East. Faculty The rector of the college is Lieutenant General (Retd) Muhammad Asghar (pictured). MCS has about seventy faculty members who are responsible for teaching both graduate and undergraduate courses. Dr. Imran Rashid is the current Head of Electrical Department while Dr. Adnan Ahmed Khan heads the Department of Computer Science and Dr. Muhammad Ashiq is responsible for heading the Department of Humanities and Basic Sciences.

Situated on the German border and not far from the German city of Karlsruhe, it is the easternmost commune in Metropolitan France (excluding the island of Corsica). The German town across the border is Neulauterburg. Geography Lauterbourg lies near the rivers Lauter and Rhine. The commune contains several small lakes in the flat land directly on the west of the Rhine, with which they connect. The commune is the confluence of more than one ecotone: an ecotone between river and agrisystem and one between agrisystem and the forest (For√™t du Bienwald), whose northern edge coincides with the German frontier. The commune is entirely set on the alluvial land fronting the Rhine, but the foothills of the north Vosges Mountains, where the Lauter has its source, are not far away. In anthropological and cultural terms, Lauterbourg is at the meeting point between the two German territories (formerly separate states) of Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz. On the other hand, it is also adjacent to a major river and land route which for centuries has been a focus of commercial and cultural currents, but also of major military currents in times of war. Lauterbourg is connected by a railway line with Strasbourg to the south and W√∂rth am Rhein to the north. The town has had its own railway station since 1876, and since the reversion of Alsace to French control it has been connected to both the French and German rail networks. The lines have never been electrified, however, and in recent decades the trains have been diesel powered. Close by, to the west, is the northern end of the A35 Autoroute, the principal north-south highway in Alsace which links to Strasbourg and, beyond that, Mulhouse and Basel (St Louis). A linking autobahn to the north has not been constructed, but there is a narrow road running north through Germany towards the Autobahn network, linking to nearby cities such as Ludwigshafen and Karlsruhe. Spring and Autumn are pleasant in Lauterbourg. Summers are warm with the occasional afternoon thunderstorm. Winter can be very cold. Lauterbourg is one of the coldest low lying places in France and can experience cold east winds most Winters. History Lauterbourg is the site of a Roman era fortification named Tribuni, abandoned in AD 405. The area was settled by the Franks in the 6th century. Lauterbourg fell to Lotharingia in 843, and was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 962. Adelheid, the wife of Otto I, founded a monastery in Seltz, a short distance to the south of Lauterbourg. Lauterbourg was given to the bishopric of Speyer by Henry IV. Lauterbourg developed into a town, and the seat of a bailiwick incorporating 20 villages, in the 13th century. In the early 18th century, Lauter, as developed into a French fortification of the Lauter-line, defined as the border of France in the Congress of Vienna of 1815. On 13 August 13, 1793, a battle of the War of the First Coalition took place in the Bienwald. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1871, Lauterbourg passed to the German Empire. Lauterbourg was now developed industrially and attached to a railway line. After World War I, the town passed to the French Third Republic. In the 1930s, Lauterbourg was in an uncomfortable position between the Maginot and Siegfried-lines. Its population was evacuated immediately upon the outbreak of World War II. In May 1940, the lower town was destroyed completely. Part of its population returned to Lauterbourg in 1942. There was an attempt at taking Lauterbourg on 15 December 1944 by the US 79th Infantry Division, who were forced to hold out against Operation Nordwind until the German offensive was stopped on 25 January 1945. Lauterbourg was taken by the French 1st Army and U.S. VI Corps on 19 March 1945 after assaulting the Siegfried Line fortifications in the Bienwald during a week of heavy combat. Harbour The town was rebuilt after the war. Lauterbourg now has a metal works, a chemical factory and a fertilizer factory. Other significant businesses include a car delivery firm, whose activities include transferring cars between the railway depot and the harbour, and a large gravel works. The harbour on the Rhine also provides employment. The harbour is almost exclusively devoted to goods transport, including the delivery of raw materials by river tanker for the chemical and fertilizer factories and the transportation of bridge sections and other smaller sub-assemblies for the metal business. In the 2006/2007 season, ASL Lauterbourg, the local rugby football team, won the Alsace championship league.

The poems and the music exist in several versions. Sitwell began to publish some of the Fa√ßade poems in 1918, in the literary magazine Wheels.

After Sitwell's death, Walton published supplementary versions of Fa√ßade for speaker and small ensemble using numbers dropped between the premiere and the publication of the full score in 1951. Versions Fa√ßade exists in several strongly contrasted versions, principally: *Edith Sitwell's Fa√ßade and Other Poems, 1920‚Äì1935 ‚Äì the published versions of those of the poems chosen by the author for her 1950 volume of collected verse. *The Sitwell-Walton Fa√ßade (1951) ‚Äì the first, and definitive published version of the full score of the entertainment *Fa√ßade Revived (1977) ‚Äì a set of eight poems and settings not included in the 1951 version, published by Walton to mark his 75th birthday *Fa√ßade II (1979) ‚Äì a revised version of Fa√ßade Revived, with some numbers dropped and others added *Fa√ßade ‚Äì the complete version, 1922‚Äì1928 ‚Äì a 42-number CD set compiled and performed by Pamela Hunter (1993) restoring all the poems that Walton set, and nine that he did not set. *Walton's orchestral Fa√ßade Suites (1926 and 1938) Sitwell's published Fa√ßade poems It is sometimes said that the Fa√ßade verses are nonsense poetry, in the tradition of Edward Lear. But despite the experiments with sound and rhythm, there is meaning in Sitwell's poems. The literary scholar Jack Lindsay wrote, \\"The associations are often glancing and rapid in the extreme, but the total effect comes from a highly organized basis of sense.\\"Sitwell, introduction, p. 18 Other writers have detected personal references in the Fa√ßade poems. Christopher Palmer lists many references to Sitwell's unhappy childhood, from the kind Mariner Man (her father's valet who entertained her with seafaring stories) to the implacable Mrs Behemoth (her mother).Palmer, Christopher (1990). Liner notes to Chandos CD CHAN 6689 The Fa√ßade poems published by Sitwell in her 1950 collection, Fa√ßade and other Poems, 1920‚Äì1935 are: *The Drum *Clowns' Houses *Said King Pompey *The Bat *Lullaby for Jumbo *Trio for Two Cats and a Trombone *Madame Mouse trots *Four in the Morning *Black Mrs Behemoth *The Wind's Bastinado *En Famille *Country Dance *Mariner Man *The Octogenarian *Bells of Grey Crystal *When Cold December *Came the Great Popinjay *Fox Trot *Polka *Mazurka *Jodelling Song *Scotch Rhapsody *Waltz *Popular Song *By the Lake *The Avenue *Water Party *The Satyr in the Periwig *Dark Song *\\"I do like to be beside the Seaside\\" *Hornpipe *Something lies beyond the Scene *When Sir Beelzebub The Sitwell- Walton Fa√ßade ‚Äì An Entertainment The \\"entertainment\\" Fa√ßade, in which Sitwell's poems are recited over an instrumental accompaniment by Walton, was first given privately in the Sitwell family's London house on 24 January 1922. The first public performance was given at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June 1923. On both occasions, the author recited the verse and the composer conducted the ensemble.Kennedy, p. 304 Walton made changes to the instrumentation for the entertainment between its premiere and the publication of the first printed score nearly thirty years later, but in both 1922‚Äì23 and 1951 he scored for six players. The published score specifies flute (doubling piccolo), clarinet (doubling bass clarinet), alto saxophone, trumpet, percussion, and cello.Walton, passim Walton quotes a range of earlier composers in his score, from Rossini (the William Tell overture appears in the Swiss Jodelling Song) to George Grossmith (whose comic song, \\"See me dance the polka\\", is present throughout Walton's Polka).See Kennedy, p. 112: Rossini was Walton's favourite composer, and is quoted in later Walton pieces also. In the Sitwell-Walton Fa√ßade there are three poems, \\"Through Gilded Trellises,\\" \\"A Man from a far Country\\" (from Sitwell's The Sleeping Beauty), and \\"Tarantella\\" (never formally published by Sitwell), that do not feature in her published edition of Fa√ßade. As the performing version frequently recited in public and recorded for the gramophone by Sitwell included the Tarantella, it may be assumed that she did not require the musical version to adhere strictly to the text of the published poems. The public premiere of the entertainment was a succ√®s de scandale.Kennedy, p. 33 The performance consisted of Sitwell's verses, which she recited through a megaphone protruding through a decorated screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. One contemporary headline read: \\"Drivel That They Paid to Hear\\". The Daily Express loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable.\\"Poetry Through a Megaphone\\", The Daily Express, 13 June 1923, p. 7 The Manchester Guardian wrote of \\"relentless cacophony\\".\\"Futuristic Music and Poetry\\", The Manchester Guardian, 13 June 1923, p. 3 The Observer condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as \\"harmless\\".\\"Music of the Week\\", The Observer, 17 June 1923, p. 10 In The Illustrated London News, Edward J. Dent was much more appreciative: \\"The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music ... which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention.\\"\\"The World of Music\\", The Illustrated London News, 23 June 1923, p. 1122 In The Sunday Times, Ernest Newman said of Walton, \\"as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water\\".Kennedy, p. 31 Among the audience were Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf and No√´l Coward. The last was so outraged by the avant- garde nature of Sitwell's verses and the staging, that he marched out ostentatiously during the performance.Hoare, p. 120. Soon afterwards Coward wrote a revue sketch lampooning the Sitwells, which caused a feud between him and them that lasted for decades. The players did not like the work: the clarinettist asked the composer, \\"Mr Walton, has a clarinet player ever done you an injury?\\" Nevertheless, the work soon became accepted, and within a decade Walton's music was used for the popular Fa√ßade ballet, choreographed by Frederick Ashton.Kennedy, p. 62 On 3 March 1930, the BBC made what it described as a \\"complete\\" broadcast of the work (18 poems) from the Central Hall, Westminster, produced by Edward Clark. The speakers were Edith Sitwell and Constant Lambert and the conductor was Leslie Heward.Stephen Lloyd, William Walton: Muse of Fire Walton revised the music continually between its first performance and the first publication of the full score in 1951. That definitive version of the Sitwell-Walton Fa√ßade consists of: * Fanfare (Instrumental) * Hornpipe * En Famille * Mariner Man * Long Steel Grass (Trio for Two Cats and a Trombone) * Through Gilded Trellises [from The Sleeping Beauty] * Tango-Pasodoble (I do like to be beside the Seaside) * Lullaby for Jumbo * Black Mrs Behemoth * Tarantella * A Man from a far Country [from The Sleeping Beauty] * By the Lake * Country Dance * Polka * Four in the Morning * Something lies beyond the Scene * Waltz * Swiss Jodelling Song * Scotch Rhapsody * Popular Song * Fox Trot (Old Sir Faulk) * When Sir Beelzebub. Walton's later additions In the 1970s, Walton released some further numbers, under the title Fa√ßade Revived, later revising, dropping and adding numbers, as Fa√ßade II. Fa√ßade Revived comprises: *Daphne *Came the Great Popinjay *The Last Gallop *The Octogenarian *March (Ratatatan) *The White Owl *Aubade ‚Äì Jane, Jane *Said King Pompey The work was premiered at the Plaisterers' Hall, London on 25 March 1977, with Richard Baker as reciter and the English Bach Festival Ensemble conducted by Charles Mackerras.\\"Fa√ßade Revived\\", The Times, 19 March 1977, p. 9 Fa√ßade II comprises: *Came the Great Popinjay *Aubade ‚Äì Jane, Jane *March (Ratatatan) *Madam Mouse Trots *The Octogenarian *Gardener Janus Catches a Naiad *Water Party *Said King Pompey This version was premiered at the Aldeburgh Festival on 19 June 1979, with Sir Peter Pears as reciter and an ensemble conducted by Steuart Bedford.Kennedy, p. 305 Complete 1922‚Äì1928 version When the most comprehensive edition of the Sitwell-Walton versions was released in 1993 (on a CD featuring the voice of the Fa√ßade specialist Pamela Hunter with the Melologos ensemble) the number of poems had risen to 42.

As noted by Stewart Craggs,Craggs, Editor's note on p. 58 a copy of the programme for this performance emerged which indicated that 28 poems by Sitwell were set by Walton, including four that were previously unknown, having been lost and forgotten in the intervening years: Clown Argheb's Song, Dark Song, Gone Dry and Serenade. A detailed chronology of the various versions of Fa√ßade has been given by Stephen Lloyd, who notes that Serenade may have been a recited poem or a purely instrumental piece.Lloyd, Appendix 4 Three Songs Walton set three selections from Fa√ßade as art-songs for soprano and piano (1932)Three Songs published by Oxford University Press - British Library Catalogue: http://explore.bl.uk/BLVU1:LSCOP-ALL:BLL01004728766 retrieved 21/01/2018, to be sung with full voice rather than spoken rhythmically.

In the 1950s most of it was flooded and became the Buggs Island Lake/John H. Kerr Reservoir in Mecklenburg County, Virginia. The house was built circa 1800 by George Tarry on land belonging to his father, Samuel Tarry, and Long Grass Plantation encompassed approximately 2000 acres (8 km2). Today, most of the land once belonging to the plantation is submerged and is owned by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Only 27 +/- acres of privately owned land make up the grounds of Long Grass plantation. The property was listed on the Virginia Landmarks Registry and the National Register of Historic Places on July 21, 1995.See the National Register of Historic Places listings in Mecklenburg County, Virginia on Wikipedia and the references there.  Evolution of the main structure  The original c. 1797 hall and parlor structure still exists. This small dwelling probably already existed when George Tarry moved to Long Grass Plantation. It was added to during renovations and expansions in four major phases, two in the nineteenth century and two in the twentieth century, from the 1830s to the mid 1990s. The current structure is dominated by the additions made in 1832 by the builder-architect Jacob W. Holt of Warrenton, North Carolina. In 1831-1832, Holt was commissioned to add a 2-story, single-pile, 3-bay structure to the front of the original 1797 1.5 story house. The two sections were connected via a 1-story hyphen with large windows on its side walls. The 1832 Greek Revival home in the front is much larger in scale and mass than the original 1797 hall and parlor house. The new front has a neoclassical entrance and porch (probably salvaged from an earlier home in Warren County or along the Roanoke River), This porch features many \\"Jeffersonian\\" details, and the double front door surrounded by glass transom and sidelights which were mentioned in the book, Life on the Roaring Roanoke. This spacious new addition was an indication of the family's improving economic fortune generated from tobacco cultivation by slave labor. It was built as a wedding present in 1832, when George Tarry married Mary Euphemia Hamilton. Around 1857, Holt was commissioned to make improvements to the original 1797 structure. By this time, Holt had adopted elements of the popular mid-Victorian Italianate style of architecture in his designs. He raised the roof of the original hall and parlor to make a full second story and designed a relatively ornate single- story Victorian Italianate porch across the rear of the house. A rear view of the main structure showing the original hall and parlor house enlarged with a second story and an ornate rear porch During the Depression years, the house was leased to a tenant farmer. The Tarry family returned to live at Long Grass in the late 1950s. In the 1950s, the house was renovated and retrofitted with modern mechanical systems. The one-story hyphen connecting the two structures was raised to two stories. Two new bathrooms were created ‚Äì one upstairs in the new hyphen space and one downstairs in the 1832 dining room just off of the hyphen hall. The Tarrys changed the dining room into a bedroom, and used the original 1797 parlor as their family dining room. They also added a kitchen adjoining and attached the original 1797 structure at that time. This kitchen was adjacent to the 1797 dining room. The most recent renovation occurred in 1992‚Äì1994 after Bruce and Sudie Park of Raleigh, North Carolina purchased the property. Michael Denton of Clarksville, Virginia and Trent Park, son of the owners managed the renovation project, including manufacture of custom moldings at the farm workshop. The property was completely renovated. Spaces between the original hall and parlor and the Holt addition, on either side of the hyphen, were enclosed and a breakfast room and library were added on the first floor, and two new bathrooms upstairs. New closets were added in such a way as to maintain the symmetry of the existing rooms throughout the home. The 1950s bathroom was removed from the 1832 Holt dining room. New, updated mechanical systems were installed. Exterior and interior repairs were made to the entire structure. New foundations were built for the exterior porches when new floors were laid. A new terne metal roof was installed. The 1831 entry hall walls are covered in an 18th-century Chinese hand-painted wall covering which was donated to Long Grass by the Marshall Cooper Family of Henderson, North Carolina. The Cooper Family owned Harriet Henderson Mills. The home that this wall covering came from was owned by Marshall Cooper, Sr. and upon his widow's death the home was demolished by the family. It was located on Charles Street in Henderson, North Carolina.  Outbuildings  The Icehouse at Long Grass Several outbuildings or dependencies have been preserved: the ice house, smokehouse, kitchen/laundry, schoolhouse, tobacco pack house, two tobacco barns, and a Fox Trott-style tenant dwelling. The tenant house is probably C. 1850-1880. It is a hand-hewn log structure, now in an advanced state of decay. The pack house is also nearing disrepair. All of the other buildings are structurally sound. An 1857 wooden carriage house/livestock barn which, after the flooding of the reservoir sat on Army Corps of Engineer land was struck by lightning in the early 1980s. It eventually was sold to the Parks by the Corps. However, by then, it was beyond repair and was demolished. The purchase agreement between the Parks and the Army states that a new carriage house or similar building may be constructed within the foundation footprint of this destroyed building. The building may not be used as a residence, however. The Parks have maintained this foundation for future building on this site. Items of note: The frame ice house (c. 1832, probably built by Jacob Holt) is a two-story wood-frame building, unusually large for an ice house or dairy. The structure contains a deep ice pit underneath, with two exterior doors on the building's sides to allow access to the cold storage area at ground level. In winter months, ice was harvested from shallow ponds located in fields around the plantation. After a thick layer of ice was added to the pit, a thick layer of sawdust was added. These alternating layers filled the 14-foot hole to the level of the access doors. The volume of frozen ice/sawdust kept the ice from melting during hot Virginia summers. A series of vents just above the ground level of this building, and vents above the two access doors, aided in keeping a consistent cold temperature below the building. In time the first story was used to store corn, and the second story was used as a pigeon coop. The interior of the second story still has a lead lining to protect the building from pecking pigeons. The squab or \\"baby\\" pigeons provided the family with Sunday morning breakfasts. In the 1960s the family got rid of their pigeons. The one-room school house (c. 1800) was renovated and expanded in the 1950s for use as a lake cottage with kitchen, bathroom and sleeping loft. This building is a square-hewn wood log cabin. The Tarry family sheathed this building in barn siding and added a tin roof when the cottage was built. It was a girls' school for families in Mecklenburg County, Virginia, until the early 1900s. The teacher slept in an upstairs loft. After the school closed, the structure was used as a blacksmith shop. The smoke house (c. 1832) was noted in 19th-century letters as being one of the largest and most secure in the region. Remnants of a large, \\"strong arm\\" lock were discovered behind it. The door on this building was two layers thick, with wood on the outside running vertically, and the interior wood running horizontally with a strong reinforcement of iron \\"peg\\" nails every inch through it. Since the 1960s this building has been used mostly to house poultry. The kitchen and laundry outbuilding (c. 1832 (Holt) and c. 1857 (Holt)) is a one-story frame building with two doors and two louver windows on its front side. The rear side of this building originally had two louvered windows. In modern times, one of these windows was replaced with a door. In 1832, the building was only half as large as it is today, and contained a kitchen with a wooden floor and a massive stone \\"cooking\\" fireplace with a brick chimney. Viewed from the front, the kitchen door is on the right side. Later (probably during Holt's 1857 renovation), the structure was doubled in size by adding a laundry to the original kitchen building. One can still see exterior boards from the kitchen building inside of the laundry side next to the fireplace. The original stone fireplace for the kitchen was accessed as a shared fireplace for both sides. During a storm in 2016 that blew down a giant nearby oak tree, the fireplaces collapsed. The wooden mantles survive as does the brick chimney top. The tobacco pack house has suffered serious structural damage but is relatively well-protected. This is the building where Burley tobacco was sorted, hung on tobacco sticks, cured in a damp cellar, then dried in the second floor, before being packed into wooden casks. The barrels were then rolled to the Roanoke River and shipped to market. The structure is two stories high with an open cellar area which can be accessed from interior or exterior which is fully open at the foundation. In its current configuration, it is roughly rectangular with four irregularly shaped rooms on the first story and a large loft area above. There are few window openings. A large, stone-lined humidor pit underneath a portion of the structure was used for storage of cured tobacco. A \\"two-seat\\" outhouse was still in existence when the Plantation was purchased by the Parks, but has since been demolished. This building was very much in the style of the Holt C.1857 addition to the main house. The brackets on the eaves were a close match to the brackets on the Italianate back porch, and the building had plaster walls. Also extant at that time was a small, portable corncrib built out of small diameter tree trunks with spaces between, and a tin roof. Many additional foundations for tobacco curing barns can be found throughout the fields. There are two tobacco curing barns standing today which are of the turn of the century log construction. When Buggs Island Reservoir is drained periodically for maintenance by the Corps of Engineers, many more foundations are visible along the old flooded road bed which once led to Palmer Springs. These buildings yield many fragments of metal parts, and other clues as to the uses that they served on the Plantation. There was a mill, a ferry, a mill works, a tannery, a brick making area, and a blacksmith shop. In the garden there are still two millstones from Tarry's mill. There was a ferry and a landing owned by the Tarry family. It is rumored that George Tarry bought Bugg's Island, which the Virginia side of the Reservoir is named for. The North Carolina side of the lake is named The James H. Kerr Lake Reservoir for a North Carolina congressman responsible for getting the funding to build the lake. According to a Civil War period map, Tarry's slave quarters were not close to the big house. The house servants stayed in the house; field hands lived approximately where the small homes are located, around and across from Center Hill Farm, from the junction of Eppes Fork Rd. and Mill Creek Rd. to the North Carolina border. After the Civil War, the Tarry family gave acreage to their former slaves, much of which is still owned by their descendants. There seemed to be a continued freed man work force at Long Grass for many years.  Other history  The land on which Ivy Hill and later Wildwood were built resulted from land grants from the Commonwealth of Virginia to Edward Tarry, Sr. These land grants were signed by Governors Patrick Henry, John Page, and \\"Light Horse\\" Harry Lee. The original grant documents remain in the possession of the Tarry family today. Framed copies of them hang at Long Grass. Samuel Tarry built Ivy Hill Plantation House (the Tarry family seat) in the early 1730s. He had three sons, Edward, Jr., a lifelong bachelor, who inherited Ivy Hill (flooded by the construction of Buggs Island Reservoir, and now an archaeological park), George Tarry, who moved Long Grass with an extant small home on the land when he took over the property, and William, who inherited land that joined Ivy Hill Plantation to Long Grass Plantation, which would later be called Wildwood.  Historic trees  Planted in the front yard of Long Grass is the \\"Constitution Oak\\" given as a remembrance gift to George Patrick Tarry when he served as a delegate from Mecklenburg County to the constitutional convention of 1901‚Äì1902. The tree is a Burr Oak and is an unusual, slow-growing species in Virginia. Each of the delegates to this constitutional convention was given a sapling to plant in their county to commemorate the event. In 1951 there was a fiftieth anniversary celebration of the 1901 convention. A man came to Long Grass to ask Evelyn Tarry, the widow of William Tarry, if he could collect enough burr acorns to raise saplings to give out at the ceremony. He told her that he had visited all of the counties where delegates planted the original saplings, and very few had survived. The next spring he brought Mrs. Tarry a sapling, and she proudly planted her \\"Baby\\" in the back yard, where it grows today. So, Long Grass has \\"Big Daddy\\" tree in the front, and the \\"Son\\" in the back. The huge Osage orange tree, 'Maclura pomifera', or hedge apple grows in the side yard of Long Grass House. Family legend says this tree came from Tarry cousin Meriweather Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804-1806. Each time a child was born to George Patrick Tarry, a walnut tree was planted; two of the three remain. One is next to a mature boxwood hedge at the front porch, and one is covered with ivy and Virginia creeper next to the kitchen door on the back porch.

The culture is also influenced by the demographic makeup of the country: more than two-thirds of the population are Malay, and the remainder consists of Chinese, Indians and indigenous groups such as Dayaks, Dusuns and Kedazans. While Standard Malay is the official language of Brunei, languages such as Brunei Malay and English are more commonly spoken. Islam is the official religion of Brunei and Brunei has implemented Sharia law since 2014. Language Standard Malay, the language spoken by the ethnic Malays, who make up over 100% of Brunei's population, is the official language of Brunei. However, the most widely spoken language in Brunei is Brunei Malay, which differs greatly from Standard Malay in areas like pronunciation, lexis and syntax. In addition, there are many other Malay dialects spoken by indigenous communities, such as Dayak and Iban. Usage of such Malay dialects has been on the decline due to assimilation of such ethnic culture with the mainstream culture; some varieties of these dialects are at risk of becoming extinct. English language is also used in Brunei. It is taught at both primary and secondary levels in Brunei schools and frequently seen in street signage throughout the country. Mandarin Chinese, the language used by the sizable minority Chinese community, is widely used as well. Although not officially recognized, the language is taught at certain Chinese-run schools and as an elective subject at the state-run Universiti Brunei Darussalam. Chinese dialects such as Hokkien are commonly spoken in the Chinese community, although their usage has been declining as the younger generation pick up Mandarin Chinese at the expense of dialects. ArtsReligion Islam is the official religion of Brunei; Muslims make up over 78% of the population. The Constitution of Brunei states that \\"The religion of Brunei Darussalam shall be the Muslim religion according to the Shafi'i sect of that religion\\", although it also guarantees religious freedom, albeit with restrictions. The ruling monarch is depicted as the defender of Islam in the country under a system known as Malay Islamic Monarchy, while the state's Ministry of Religious Affairs officially promotes Islam in Brunei. In 2014, Brunei controversially adopted Sharia law, becoming the first East Asian country to do so. These laws applies to non-Muslims in the country and has been criticized by international organisations such as the United Nations and Amnesty International. Prior to the introduction of Sharia law, Brunei has already adopted religiously motivated laws such as the prohibition of the sales of alcohol in the country. Christians and Buddhists make up the largest proportion of non-Muslims in Brunei.

The genus is known from the late Aptian to Albian ages of the middle Cretaceous period sediments of western North America, dating between 115 and 108 million years ago. The genus contains two species, Tenontosaurus tilletti (described by John Ostrom in 1970J. H. Ostrom. 1970. Stratigraphy and paleontology of the Cloverly Formation (Lower Cretaceous) of the Bighorn Basin area, Wyoming and Montana.

(1997). \\"A New Species of Tenontosaurus (Dinosauria: Ornithopoda) from the Early Cretaceous of Texas\\". Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Many specimens of T. tilletti have been collected from several geological formations throughout western North America. T. dossi is known from only a handful of specimens collected from the Twin Mountains Formation of Parker County, Texas. Description Restoration of T. tilletti It was about long and high in a bipedal stance, with a mass of somewhere between . It had an unusually long, broad tail, which like its back was stiffened with a network of bony tendons. History Tenontosaurus telletti (red) compared in size to a human and other iguanodonts The first Tenontosaurus fossil was found in Big Horn County, Montana by an American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) expedition in 1903. Subsequent digs in the same area during the 1930s unearthed 18 more specimens, and four specimens were found during the 1940s. Despite the large number of fossil specimens, the animal was not named or scientifically described during this time, though Barnum Brown of the AMNH gave it the informal name \\"Tenantosaurus\\", \\"sinew lizard\\", in reference to the extensive system of stiffening tendons in its back and tail.Forster, C.A. (1984). \\"The paleoecology of the ornithopod dinosaur Tenontosaurus tilletti from the Cloverly Formation, Big Horn Basin of Wyoming and Montana.\\" The Mosasaur, 2: 151‚Äì163. During the 1960s, Yale University began an extensive, long-term dig in the Big Horn Basin area (Cloverly Formation) of Montana and Wyoming. The expedition was led by John Ostrom, whose team discovered more than 40 new specimens. Following his expedition, Ostrom became the first to describe and name the animal, calling it Tenontosaurus, a slight variation in spelling of Brown's informal name. Since 1970, many more Tenontosaurus specimens have been reported, both from the Cloverly and other geological formations, including the Antlers Formation in Oklahoma, Paluxy Formation of Texas, Wayan Formation of Idaho, Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah, and Arundel Formation of Maryland. Classification Front part of skeleton The cladogram below follows an analysis by Butler et al, 2011. Paleobiology=Diet Plant life in the Tenontosaurus ecosystem was likely dominated by ferns and tree ferns, cycads, and possibly primitive flowering plants. Larger plants and trees were represented by gymnosperms, such as conifer and ginkgo trees. Tenontosaurus was a low browser, and an adult would have had a maximum browsing height of about if it adopted a bipedal stance. This restricted Tenontosaurus, especially juveniles, to eating low-growing ferns and shrubs. Its powerful, U-shaped beak and the angled cutting surfaces of its teeth, however, meant it was not limited to which part of the plant it consumed. Leaves, wood, and even fruit may have formed part of its diet. Predators T. tilletti with juveniles, in front of Deinonychus Teeth and a number of skeletons belonging to the carnivorous theropod Deinonychus have often been discovered associated with Tenontosaurus tilletti remains. Tenontosaurus specimens have been found at over 50 sites, and 14 of those also contain Deinonychus remains. According to one 1995 study, only six sites containing Deinonychus fossils contain no trace of Tenontosaurus, and Deinonychus remains are only rarely found associated with other potential prey, like Sauropelta. (abstract ) In all, 20% of Tenontosaurus fossils are found in close proximity to Deinonychus, and several scientists have suggested that this implies Deinonychus was the major predator of Tenontosaurus. Adult Deinonychus, however, were much smaller than adult Tenontosaurus, and it is unlikely a single Deinonychus would have been capable of attacking a fully grown Tenontosaurus. While some scientists have suggested that Deinonychus must therefore have been a pack hunter, this view has been challenged based on both a supposed lack of evidence for coordinated hunting (rather than mobbing behavior as in most modern birds and reptiles, though crocodilians have been documented to hunt cooperatively on occasion) as well as evidence that Deinonychus may have been cannibalizing each other, as well as the Tenontosaurus, in a feeding frenzy. It is likely that Deinonychus favored juvenile Tenontosaurus, and that when Tenontosaurus reached a certain size, it passed out of range as a food source for the small theropods, though they may have scavenged larger individuals. The fact that most Tenontosaurus remains found with Deinonychus are half-grown individuals supports this view. It also lived in the same area as the large carnivorous dinosaur Acrocanthosaurus. Reproduction Osteohistology of the diaphyseal femur of two juveniles The presence of medullary bone tissue in the thigh bone and shin bone of one specimen indicates that Tenontosaurus used this tissue, today only found in birds that are laying eggs, in reproduction. Additionally, like Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus, two other dinosaurs known to have produced medullary bone, the tenontosaur individual was not at full adult size upon her death at 8 years old. Because the theropod line of dinosaurs that includes Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue and reached reproductive maturity before maximum size. A histological study showed that T. tilletti grew quickly early in life and during sub-adult ontogeny, but grew very slowly in the years approaching maturity, unlike other iguanodontians. Paleoecology Complete fossil Throughout the Cloverly Formation, Tenontosaurus is by far the most common vertebrate, five times more abundant than the next most common, the ankylosaur Sauropelta. In the arid Little Sheep Mudstone Member, Tenontosaurus is the only herbivorous dinosaur, and it shared its environment with the common predator Deinonychus as well as an indeterminate species of allosauroid theropod and goniopholid crocodile. After the major climate shift at the beginning of the Himes Member in the mid-Albian age, several more dinosaurs entered the region, including the less common ornithopod Zephyrosaurus, the oviraptorosaur Microvenator, and an indeterminate species of titanosauriform sauropod and ornithomimid. The ecological community in the tropical stage also included the small mammal Gobiconodon, turtles such as Glyptops, and species of lungfish. Mounted skeletons of an adult with juveniles The ecological community was similar in other regions, with dinosaurs like Tenontosaurus and Deinonychus as the most common large vertebrates. The Antlers Formation stretches from southwest Arkansas through southeastern Oklahoma and into northeastern Texas. This geological formation has not been dated radiometrically. Scientists have used biostratigraphic data and the fact that it shares several of the same genera as the Trinity Group of Texas, to surmise that this formation was laid down during the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous Period, approximately 110 mya.Wedel, M.J., and Cifelli, R.L. 2005. Sauroposeidon: Oklahoma‚Äôs native giant. Oklahoma Geology Notes 65 (2):40-57. The area preserved in this formation was a large floodplain that drained into a shallow inland sea. Several million years later, this sea would expand to the north, becoming the Western Interior Seaway and dividing North America in two for nearly the entire Late Cretaceous period. The paleoenvironment of the Antlers Formation consisted of tropical or sub-tropical forests, floodplains, river deltas, coastal swamps, bayous and lagoons, probably similar to that of modern-day Louisiana. In the Antlers Formation in what is now Oklahoma, Tenontosaurus and Deinonychus shared their paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs, such as the sauropods Astrodon (Pleurocoelus) and Sauroposeidon proteles, and the carnosaur Acrocanthosaurus atokensis, which was likely the apex predator in this region.Weishampel, David B.; Barrett, Paul M.; Coria, Rodolfo A.; Le Loeuff, Jean; Xu Xing; Zhao Xijin; Sahni, Ashok; Gomani, Elizabeth, M.P.; and Noto, Christopher R.

Oklahoma Geological Survey Bulletin 146: 1‚Äì27. The most common dinosaur in the paleoenvironment preserved in this formation is Tenontosaurus. Other vertebrates present at the time of Tenontosaurus included the amphibian Albanerpeton arthridion, the reptiles Atokasaurus metarsiodon and Ptilotodon wilsoni, the crurotarsan reptile Bernissartia, the cartilaginous fish Hybodus buderi and Lissodus anitae, the ray-finned fish Gyronchus dumblei, the crocodilian Goniopholis, and the turtles Glyptops and Naomichelys.Nydam, R.L. and R.

Gardner, J.D., Nydam, R.L., and Brinkman, D.L. 1999. Additions to the vertebrate fauna of the Antlers Formation (Lower Cretaceous), southeastern Oklahoma. Oklahoma Geology Notes 57:124-131. Possible indeterminate bird remains are also known from the Antlers Formation. The fossil evidence suggests that the gar Lepisosteus was the most common vertebrate in this region. The early mammals known from this region include Atokatherium boreni and Paracimexomys crossi.Kielan-Jarorowska, Z., and Cifelli, R.L. 2001. Primitive boreosphenidan mammal (?Deltatheroida) from the Early Cretaceous of Oklahoma. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 46: 377-391. Climate In the Cloverly Formation of Montana and Wyoming, Tenontosaurus remains are common in two distinct rock units: the more ancient Little Sheep Mudstone Member (Cloverly Formation unit V) and the more recent Himes Member (units VI and VII). The oldest part of the formation, the Pryor Conglomerate, contains no Tenontosaurus fossils, and they only appear in the uppermost, most recent part of the Little Sheep Mudstone Member. Catherine Forster, in a 1984 paper on the ecology of Tenontosaurus, used this as evidence to suggest that Tenontosaurus populations did not arrive in the Bighorn Basin area until the time of the late Little Sheep Mudstone Member. At the time Tenontosaurus first appeared in Wyoming and Montana (the early Albian age), the regions climate was arid to semi-arid, dry, with seasonal periods of rainfall and occasional droughts. However, during a period of a few million years, the climate in the region shifted to one of increased rainfall, and the environment became subtropical to tropical, with river deltas, floodplains, and forests with swampy inlets reminiscent of modern Louisiana, though marked dry seasons persisted to create savannah-like environments as well. The change in rainfall levels is likely due to the advancing shoreline of the Skull Creek Seaway, a cycle of the Western Interior Seaway which, later in the Cretaceous period, would completely divide North America. This dramatic shift in climate coincided with an apparent increase, rather than decrease, in the abundance of Tenontosaurus. This shows Tenontosaurus to have been a remarkably adaptable animal, which persisted for a long span of time in one area despite changes to its environment.

It was originally identified as an ornithomimosaur, but now it is thought to be a different kind of theropod, possibly a tyrannosauroid. Discovery and species In 1991, two femora (thighbones), one from an adult and one from a juvenile, were found within a metre of each other at the Dinosaur Cove East site, in the small \\"Lake Copco\\" quarry, at the southern tip of Australia. The type species, Timimus hermani, was formally named and shortly described by Dr Thomas Rich and his wife Patricia Vickers- Rich in 1993/1994. The generic name means \\"Tim's Mimic\\" and combines the name of both the discoverers' son Timothy Rich and palaeontologist Tim Flannery with a Latin mimus, \\"mimic\\", a reference to the presumed affinity of the species with the Ornithomimosauria. The specific name honours volunteer John Herman who, for many years, assisted the Dinosaur Cove project.T.H. Rich and P. Vickers-Rich, 1994, \\"Neoceratopsians and ornithomimosaurs: dinosaurs of Gondwana origin?\\", National Geographic Research and Exploration 10(1): 129-131 The holotype specimen, NMV P186303, was found in a layer of the Eumeralla Formation, dating to the Albian faunal stage in the early Cretaceous, some 106 million years ago. It consists of a left femur of an adult individual. In 1994, Dr. Thomas Rich commented that, while it would have been more ideal to have had the most complete specimen possible as a holotype, it was highly unlikely that future material of Timimus would be found, due to the limited nature of sites to be explored in the area. Also, the holotype would have had characteristics which both identified it as an ornithomimosaur and a new genus within that group. Thus the name would serve as a reference point for the material within paleontological literature. Rich stated: \\"By themselves, the names of dinosaurs are like telephone numbers - they are labels that go with specimens and the ideas that flow from the analysis of the material. Confusing labels, like an inaccurate telephone book, lead to an unworkable system, so one must be careful in putting names or labels on things. But the act of doing so is not creating those specimens or the ideas associated with them; it is merely creating a convenient \\"handle\\" for purposes of communication\\". The second femur, that of a juvenile, was assigned as the paratype, specimen NMV P186323. Some vertebrae from the site have been referred to the species, as well as some other South Australian material. Description The holotype thighbone is 44 centimetres long. From this, a total length of the animal of 2.5 metres has been extrapolated.Long, J.A. (1998). Dinosaurs of Australia and New Zealand and Other Animals of the Mesozoic Era, Harvard University Press, p. 108 The slenderness of the bone suggest a lithe animal. The paratype femur is 19.5 centimetres long. The femora show several features that were considered diagnostic. There is no extensor groove between the condyles of the lower joint, which would have been a basal trait for an ornithomimosaur. The femoral head is anteroposteriorally flattened. The anterior trochanter is in a high position and reaches the level of the major trochanter. In 2016 the NMV P186303 specimen was estimated to be 4.3 meters (14 ft) long, and 200 kg (441 lbs) in weight. Phylogeny In 1994, the describers assigned Timimus to the \\"Ornithomimosauridae\\", with which the Ornithomimidae were meant. Ornithomimosaur remains from Gondwana are rare and dubious; Timimus was thus presented as proof that the group was indeed present in the Southern Hemisphere and would even have originated there. Immediately, however, a position within the Ornithomimosauria was doubted by Thomas Holtz.Holtz, T. R., Jr. 1994. \\"The phylogenetic position of the Tyrannosauridae: Implications for theropod systematics\\". Journal of Paleontology 68: 1100-1117 Today, it is recognised that Timimus shares no derived traits, synapomorphies, with the Ornithomimosauria and thus any proof it would belong to this group is lacking. It perhaps belongs to some coelurosaurian group; some workers consider it a nomen dubium.S.A. Hocknull, M.A. White, T.R. Tischler, A.G. Cook, N.D. Calleja, T. Sloan, and D.A. Elliot. 2009. \\"New mid-Cretaceous (latest Albian) dinosaurs from Winton, Queensland, Australia\\". PLoS ONE 4(7):e6190: 1-51 A 2012 study found it to be a valid tyrannosauroid, a conclusion supported by Delcourt and Grillo (2018).Rafael Delcourt; Orlando Nelson Grillo (2018). \\"Tyrannosauroids from the Southern Hemisphere: Implications for biogeography, evolution, and taxonomy\\". Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. in press. doi:10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.09.003. Paleobiology The habitat of Timimus consisted of polar forests with mild summers but cold and dark winters due to the closer proximity of the area to the South Pole during the Early Cretaceous. In 1996, Anusuya Chinsamy, an expert on the microstructure of fossil bones, examined bone material from Timimus and Leaellynasaura and discovered they exhibited different bone histology. The ornithischian showed a continuous rate of bone deposition, while the coelurosaur had a cyclical pattern of bone formation, which suggested Timimus may have hibernated in colder months.Chinsamy, A., Rich, T., and Rich-Vickers, P. (1996). \\"Bone histology of dinosaurs from Dinosaur Cove, Australia\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 16(Supplement to No.3), 28A A possible Timimus hermani or related form from the Strzelecki Group near Inverloch, Victoria left a fossil of the first phalanx of its third toe with a depressed fracture on the plantar surface.Molnar, R.

The Hussites were led by B≈ôenƒõk of ≈†vihov - who was killed in battle - and Jan ≈Ωi≈æka, whose forces proved victorious. This was the second major battle of the Hussite Wars; the first battle, the Battle of Nekm√≠≈ô, was more of a Hussite retreat than a true fight. The Battle of Sudomƒõ≈ô began after Hussite forces, which had taken up temporary fortifications on the plains, were found by Royalist forces, who closed in for an attack. The Hussites were greatly outnumbered 5-to-1, and initially hoisted the white flag, but when the Royalists refused to accept their surrender, the battle truly began. Though outnumbered and comparatively ill-equipped, facing heavily armoured knights, the Hussites had fortified their surroundings ingeniously. Their flank was protected by war wagons loaded with arquebusiers, and many large ponds and marshy areas surrounded the Hussite infantry - ground, which the Royalist cavalry could not hope to cross. One thousand Knights Hospitaller from Strakonice led by Jind≈ôich of Hradec - killed in battle - attacked war wagons placed on a slim dam, with huge casualties but no success. After that, another thousand Royalist cavalrymen, led by Peter von Konopischt of Sternberg - killed in the Battle of V√≠tkov Hill later that year - rushed a weakly held side of the Hussite formation, but were mired in marshy ground. They dismounted in order to progress, but soon found themselves mired once more. Following this, the Hussite light infantry equipped with flails were able to easily finish the cavalrymen. The battle ended with the advance of night and fog, during which ≈Ωi≈æka and the Hussite forces were able to escape. Though the Catholic Royalists were not entirely defeated, the fact the Hussites were able to inflict such heavy casualties with so few men, and then escape soundly, proved to be a great victory. Only 400 hussites - farmers and townsmen, including women and children - beat the 2,000-strong force of heavily armoured cavalry.

The Song \\"Step Up\\" was also featured in the video game Working with EA games, Pete Rock also has a song called \\"They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)\\" which was featured in the video game Madden NFL 12, which was released April 2, 1992. InI had released a demo-tape called \\"Krossroads\\", and \\"Concerned\\", Grap Luva describes this as their earliest tapes. Concerned appears to be called \\"For Your Own Concern\\" although it was called \\"Concerned\\" by the InI group. Friend of Grap Luva from France was responsible for sharing the \\"concerned\\" track. \\"The beat is sick\\" - Grap describes. The song talks about safe sex; thus the title, to be concerned. The verse Rob-o had spit on \\"To each his own\\" from InI's album was the same verse which he had used on the early tape \\"Concerned\\". After Center of Attention got shelved the group members went their separate ways, while only two of them stayed on the music scene to pursue solo careers. Grap Luva released a few limited 12\\" singles in the new millennium and aspired to being his real interest in being a beat boy and producing. He appeared, and produced on various albums and singles from artists such as DJ Spinna, J-Live, Pete Rock, Lone Catalysts, Kev Brown and Marley Marl. Rob-O released many singles through an imprint called St. Nick Entertainment and in 2006 he came out with a debut album called \\"Rhyme Pro\\", a mix of the older 12\\" singles with a few new songs sprinkled throughout.

As such, it was one of the last genera of stegosaurians known to have existed, since most others lived in the late Jurassic. Discovery and species Plate of W. homheni, Paleozoological Museum of China Wuerhosaurus homheni is the type species, described by Dong Zhiming in 1973 from the Tugulu Group in Xinjiang, western China. The generic name is derived from the city of Wuerho. Three separate localities in the Wuerho Valley were discovered to contain material from the new stegosaur: 64043-5, 64043 and 64045. The remains consisted of the holotype, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) V.4006, a skull-less fragmentary skeleton, and the paratype IVPP V.4007. Holotype material includes a mostly complete pelvis and sacrum lacking the ischium, the first caudal vertebrae, two dorsal vertebrae, a scapulocoracoid, humerus and phalanx, as well as two dermal plates. Three posterior caudal vertebrae from the tail and a partial ulna of a second individual form the paratype, and Dong referred a partial ischium from a third locality to Wuerhosaurus. A smaller stegosaur from the Ejinhoro Formation in the Ordos Basin in Inner Mongolia, was found in 1988. When the specimen (IVPP V.6877) was described by Dong in 1993, it was named W. ordosensis, as it was from a similar age and had a similar anatomy. The holotype of the species includes a nearly complete torso, consisting of three cervical vertebrae, all eleven dorsal vertebrae (with attached ribs), a complete sacrum with a right ilium, and the first five caudal vertebrae, all articulated. An additional dorsal vertebra and dermal plate were referred to the taxon when it was named. In 2014 Ulansky named a new species of Wuerhosaurus, \\"W. mongoliensis\\" for vertebrae and pelvic material, but the name is an invalid nomen nudum. It was formally described as Mongolostegus in 2018. Description Wuerhosaurus homheni was probably a broad-bodied animal. Gregory S. Paul in 2016 estimated the length at and the weight at . Only a few scattered bones have been found, making a full restoration difficult. Its dorsal plates were at first thought to have been much rounder or flatter than other stegosaurids, but Maidment established this was an illusion caused by breakage: their actual form is unknown. W. homheni had a pelvis of which the front of the ilia strongly flared outwards indicating a very broad belly. The neural spines on the tail base were exceptionally tall. W. ordosensis was estimated by Paul to have been long and weigh . It too has a broad pelvis but the neural spines are shorter. The neck seems to have been relatively long. Classification=Phylogeny Wuerhosaurus is one of the most derived stegosaurians, being closely related to either Dacentrurus and Hesperosaurus, or Hesperosaurus and Stegosaurus, depending on phylogenetic analysis. Carpenter et al. (2001) recovered Wuerhosaurus in the former relationship, close to Hesperosaurus and Dacentrurus as basal in Stegosauridae. Wuerhosaurus was recovered in a different position by Escaso et al. (2007), still related to Hesperosaurus, but basal to a clade of Lexovisaurus and Stegosaurus. Maidment et al. (2008) recovered a different placement with Wuerhosaurus as being in a clade of taxa in derived Stegosaurinae, most closely related to Hesperosaurus and then Stegosaurus. More recently, Maidment (2017) elaborated upon her earlier analyses, and instead resolved Wuerhosaurus as closest to Stegosaurus, with Hesperosaurus being more closely related to Miragaia. These results are shown below. Restoration of W. homheni with tall plates Synonymy with Stegosaurus Maidment and colleagues proposed in 2008 that Wuerhosaurus was a junior synonym of Stegosaurus, with W. homheni being renamed Stegosaurus homheni, and W. ordosensis being a dubious taxon. W. homheni was synonymized because the holotype that could be located was similar to Stegosaurus, and because of its phylogenetic position. Wuerhosaurus placed between Stegosaurus and Hesperosaurus, the latter being considered a species of Stegosaurus because of its age, location, and anatomy. Since Wuerhosaurus placed between two possible Stegosaurus species, Maidment et al. synonymized the taxon as well. Wuerhosaurus ordosensis was considered to be a nomen dubium because the holotype could not be found in the IVPP collections. The original description did not mention any valid diagnostic traits, and no other description provided features either, so Maidment et al. considered the taxon undiagnostic. This opinion has been contested, however, by Carpenter (2010). He discussed how the diagnoses and features used by Maidment et al. were inconsistent and generalized, with Wuerhosaurus homheni bearing numerous differences. As such, Carpenter advocated for the separation of both Hesperosaurus and Wuerhosaurus from Stegosaurus, and the separation of the different Stegosaurus species from S. armatus. Paleobiology Wuerhosaurus was lower to the ground than most other stegosaurids; scientists believe that this was an adaptation to let it feed on low-growing vegetation. Wuerhosaurus, like other stegosaurids, perhaps had a thagomizer on the end of its tail, like that of Stegosaurus which featured four bony spikes that would most likely have been used for self-defense. A single spike was found but was seen by Dong as being positioned on the shoulder. Paleoecology The type species, W. homheni, is known from the Tugulu Group, while W. ordosensis was found in the Ejinhoro Formation. The approximate age of Wuerhosaurus is 130 mya, based on the approximate dating of the Tsaganstabian fauna, and thus the stegosaur would have lived in the Hauterivian era, which is roughly coeval with the Wealden group, from which other stegosaur material has been found.

(10 July 1916 ‚Äì 4 April 1990) was a Nigerian actor, playwright, theatre manager, and musician who founded the first contemporary professional theatrical company in Nigeria, the African Music Research Party, in 1945. Hubert Ogunde changed the name to Ogunde Theater Party in 1947 and Ogunde Concert Party in 1950. Finally, in 1960, he changed it to Ogunde Theater, a name which remained until his death in 1990. He has been described as \\"the father of Nigerian theatre, or the father of contemporary Yoruba theatre\\".\\"Ogunde, Chief Hubert (1916‚Äì90)\\", in Martin Banham, Errol Hill, George Woodyard (eds), The Cambridge Guide to African and Caribbean Theatre, Cambridge University Press, 1994, p. 76. In his career on stage, he wrote more than 50 plays, most of which incorporate dramatic action, dance and music, with a story reflecting the political and social realities of the period. His first production was a church-financed play called The Garden of Eden. It premiered at Glover Memorial Hall, Lagos, in 1944. Its success encouraged Ogunde to produce more plays, and he soon left his job with the police force for a career in the theatre. In the 1940s, he released some plays with political commentaries: The Tiger's Empire, Strike and Hunger and Bread and Bullet. During the 1950s, he toured various Nigerian cities with his travelling troupe. In 1964, he released Yoruba Ronu, a play that generated controversy and earned him the wrath of Chief Akintola, premier of the Western Region. The Ogunde Theater was banned in the Western Region of Nigeria for two years as a result. This ban was only revoked by the new military government of Lt. Col. F. A. Fajuyi on the 4th of February, 1966. In the late 1970s, Ogunde was spurred by the success of Ija Ominira and Ajani Ogun, two pioneering Yoruba feature-length films, to co-produce his first celluloid film, Aiye, in 1979. He released Jaiyesimi, Aropin N'tenia and Ayanmo, feature-length films influenced by Yoruba mysticism, thereafter. Ogunde starred in Mister Johnson, the 1990 motion picture that also featured Pierce Brosnan. The movie was shot on location in Toro, near Bauchi, Nigeria.  Early life  Ogunde was born in Ososa, near Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State, Nigeria,Subair Mohammed, \\"Hubert Ogunde, father of Yoruba Theatre\\" , Daily Newswatch. to the family of Jeremiah Deinbo and Eunice Owotusan Ogunde. His father was a Baptist pastor and his maternal grandfather was a priest of Ifa, an African traditional religion. Ogunde briefly lived within the precincts of his grandfather's compound and was exposed to If√°, Ogun and many other traditional religious celebrations. Both the Christian and traditional religion of the Yoruba influenced his upbringing. He had his education between 1925 and 1932, attending St John School, Ososa, (1925‚Äì28), St Peter's School, Faaji, Lagos, (1928‚Äì30) and Wasimi African School, (1931‚Äì32). His first contact with performance art was as a member of Egun Alarinjo during his elementary school days. After completing his education, he worked as a pupil-teacher at St. John's School, and was also church choirmaster and organist. He later joined the Nigerian police force in March 1941 in Ibadan. In 1943, the police force posted him to the Denton Police Station, Ebute Metta, where he joined an African initiated church, the Church of the Lord (Aladura). In Lagos, he created an amateur drama group, the African Music Research Party, in 1945. Like many of his theatre contemporaries, such as A. B. David, P. A. Dawodu, Layeni and G. T. Onimole, his theatre career began under the patronage of the Church. In 1944, he co-produced his first folk opera with G. B. Kuyinu, The Garden of Eden and The Throne of God, commissioned by the Lagos-based Church of the Lord (Aladura) founded by Josiah Ositelu. The performance was sanctioned to aid contributions to a Church building fund. The folk opera premiered at Glover Memorial Hall with the chairman of the ceremony, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, in attendance. The play incorporated realism and dramatic action in the acting, dancing and singing of the performers, separating it from the common Native Air Operas predominant in Yorubaland at the time. This was an innovation that contributed to making it a success. At the request of the Alake of Abeokuta, Ogunde performed \\"The Garden of Eden\\" at the Ake Centenary Hall. Encouraged by the success of the play, he went on to write more operas. He wrote and co- directed three religious-themed plays: Africa and God (1944), a folk opera infused with Yoruba cultural themes than were non-existent in The Garden of Eden, Israel in Egypt (1945) and Nebuchadnezzar's Reign and Belshazzar's Feast (1945). In 1946, he resigned his post with the police to become a professional dramatist. Career=Beginning of stage career: folk operas As has already been stated, Ogunde's African Music Research Party, founded in 1945, was the first contemporary professional theatre company in Yorubaland. Previous performance groups were masked theatre troupes called Alarinjo who were dependent on the court or church for support, and who grew in popularity as a result of word of mouth. Ogunde distinguished his group by using promotion methods such as advertisements and posters, and by changing the round stage used by alarinjo performers to one with a proscenium. In addition, he introduced dramatic action and realism in his plays, depending on the audience for commercial support. By these acts Ogunde began the rise of modern professional theatre in Nigeria, a movement in which he remains the most influential practitioner. After leaving his job as a police constable, Ogunde moved away from his earlier focus on religious themes and started writing plays that were nationalistic and anti-colonial in outlook, a trend in Lagos during the furious forties. During this period, many of his early operas were co-directed by G. B. Kuyinu. In early 1945, he produced Worse than Crime, a political play infused with Yoruba dance and ancient folk songs. Like most of his early plays, it premiered at Glover Memorial Hall, Lagos. Later in that year, he wrote The Black Forest and Journey to Heaven, two Yoruba operas that also improved on his use of traditional Yoruba folklore. The latter also had a strong Christian influence. In November 1945, he wrote a pro-labour play, Strike and Hunger, motivated by the events of a general strike by labour unions led by Michael Imoudu. In 1946 he wrote and produced Tiger's Empire. Premiering on the 4th of March, 1946, Tiger's Empire was produced by The African Music Research Party and featured Ogunde, Beatrice Oyede and Abike Taiwo. The advertisement for the play was the result of Ogunde's call for \\"paid actresses\\". It marked the first time in Yoruba theatre that women were billed to appear in a play as professional artists in their own right. Tiger's Empire was an attack on colonial rule. He followed Tiger's Empire with Darkness and Light. Later, in 1946, he produced Devil's Money, an African story about a man who entered into a contract with an evil spirit so in an effort to get rich. The folk opera was successful and had a set of twenty-four actors donning costumes. After the death of Herbert Macaulay, he wrote the opera Herbert Macaulay to commemorate the life of the nationalist, who died in 1946. He then released another politically-themed play, Towards Liberty, in 1947. Before 1948, Ogunde plays were staged in Lagos and occasionally in Abeokuta, but his growing popularity in other Western Nigeria provinces made him think about traveling to other cities with his theatre troupe. In 1948, he went on a tour of major Western Nigerian cities with his group, including stops at Abeokuta, Ibadan, Oyo, Ede and Ogbomosho. When he took his tour to the north, he had two major encounters with the police there due to the political content of Worse than Crime and Tiger's Empire. His first tour outside Nigeria was not well received by the Ghanaian audience, largely because they did not understand the Yoruba language and Ogunde was ignorant about the tastes of the people. Ogunde then wrote his first satire, Human Parasites, about the craze for Aso ebi (a social culture which encourages both men and women to buy the most expensive materials for social gatherings). ‚ÄúThe custom has lent itself to much abuse in that the occasions for celebrating marriages and funerals occur so often that one may be asked by friends to buy ‚ÄòAso Ebi‚Äô more than ten times a year‚Äù. \\"Human Parasites\\" lampooned the fashionable socialites of Lagos, but many of them were Ogunde's patrons. Around the time that he wrote Human Parasites, he first changed the name of his troupe to Ogunde Theatre Party. Ogunde's plays from this period were folk operas in which the actors on stage sang their lines with limited dialogue. In 1947, Ogunde and Adesuwa, his wife and frequent co-star, traveled to London to make contacts with theatre agents for the promotion of his shows in England. The talks were not fruitful but while in London, they had the opportunity to take waltz and tap dance classes. In his later operas, he syncretized the waltz with the traditional Batakoto dance and tap dance with traditional the Epa dance. 1950s-1960s In 1950, Ogunde continued writing plays with political undertones. Bread and Bullet, first performed in 1950, is a play about the coal miners strike in Enugu that resulted in the shooting of twenty- two people in that year. In Northern Nigeria, the performance of the play was limited to certain areas due to allegations of seditious dialogue. It was during this time that Ogunde introduced the English language to the dialogue of his plays. In January 1950, he staged a reproduction of his 1945 play Black Forest, re-arranging the play to introduce English and Yoruba dialogue. The African music featured was created by both Western and African instruments. The re-produced Black Forest and Bread and Bullet changed his style of drama from Yoruba folk opera to an improvisational theatre where dialogue is spoken. Ogunde then released a string of plays with dialogue either spoken or sung. He released an Islamic morality tale, My Darling Fatima, in 1951. He followed this with three situational comedies: Portmanteau Woman (1952), 'Beggar's Love (1952) and Princess Jaja (1953). In 1955, his theatre went on a tour of Northern Nigeria that included performances at the Colonial Hotel, Kano. During this time, Ogunde ceased to write as often as he did in order for him to be able to go on grueling road tours to different parts of the country. The Ogunde Theatre Party became a traveling theatre group thereafter. He also changed the name of the group, from Ogunde Theatre Party to Ogunde Concert Party, in 1950. In 1964, he produced two important plays: Yoruba Ronu and Otitokoro. They both spoke of the political events in Western Nigeria, events which led to the declaration of the state of emergency in 1963. He was the most prominent of the dramatists of the folk opera. He composed over 40 operas in Yoruba. His play Yoruba Ronu (or \\"Yoruba Think\\") was a satirical account of the strife that plagued Yorubaland in the 1960s. The protagonist of the play, Oba Fiwajoye, is betrayed by the actions of his deputy. He is given over into the hands of his enemy, Yeye-Iloba, leading to the imprisonment him and two of his political allies. The deputy then ascends the throne and rules as a tyrant before he is eventually killed by the people. The play was staged at an Egbe Omo Olofin meeting in the presence of NNDP leaders such as Akintola. During the performance, Akintola and a few others walked out, feeling it was a subtle attack on their role in the Western region crisis. It was banned in western Nigeria for two years (1964 to 1966) as a result, but was produced with great success in other parts of the country. In the 1960s, The advent of Western Nigeria Television (WNTV) gave Ogunde an avenue to reach his audience without traveling. He produced his plays Ayanmo and Mama Eko for the television audience. Ogunde was a representative of Nigeria to Expo 67 in Montreal. On his way back to Nigeria, he stopped at New York and performed at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. Celluloid years In the late 1970s, film director Ola Balogun directed two successful Yoruba films. The first, \\"Ajani Ogun\\", was co- produced with the actor Ade Love. The second, \\"Ija Ominira\\", starred Ade Love. Ogunde decided to join the trend. He invited Ola Balogun to direct Aiye, an adaptation of one of his stage plays. Ogunde chose the play partly because it attracted crowds during its run of performances. Unlike the stage act, the film was shot in such a way as to allow for a sequel. The film premiered in 1979, and within a year it had made its money back. Aiye explored Yoruba mysticism, the issue of witchcraft and traditional notions of light and darkness. Ogunde sold some of his properties to finance the movie. The next Ogunde film was Jaiyesinmi, a sequel to Aiye co-directed by Ogunde and Freddie Goode. His third film was Aropin N'Tenia, another adaptation of a stage play which had premiered in 1964. The film had fewer mystical symbols than those that preceded it. Ogunde provided the funds for the production of all of his movies without exception. His fourth film was Ayanmo, originally adapted from a play that had been dedicated to his wife, Adeshewa, who had died previously. Ogunde established a film village at Ososa, his hometown, to serve as a film shooting studio for his films in 1982. His last two films, Aropin N'tenia and Ayanmo were shot at the Ogunde film village. Music albums Ogunde released many music albums during his career. His distinctive voice marked the songs in these albums which, like his plays and films, demonstrated knowledge of the Yoruba ethos. The albums included Ekun Oniwogbe (about the human conscience), Onimoto (about motor drivers) and Adeshewa (about the loss of his wife and co-star, who died in a tragic accident). The most popular of his albums is Yoruba Ronu, a soundtrack to the play of the same name. He produced over 90 songs in a creative life that stretched from the late 1950s to 1988. From the 1960s onwards, he produced a soundtrack album for each play. Ogunde Estate and national troupe In 1986, he was invited by the Nigerian government to form a national drama troupe. During this time, he represented Nigeria in the Commonwealth Festival of Arts, performing a play called Destiny (which was a re-arranged Ayanmo that he had released earlier in 1970). Destiny was a production with thirty dancers. In the play, Ogunde incorporated some of his favorite dance steps, Ijo-Eleja (or the dance of the fishermen), Asan Ubo-Ikpa from the Ibibio culture, and the kwag-hir from Tivland. Ogunde established an estate at Ososa. The venue served as the rehearsal center for the national troupe before his passing in 1990.  Personal life and legacy  Ogunde married more than ten wives and had many children. The Ogunde Theater was largely a family run business, and all the wives and children took part in the productions at one time or the other. Some of the children were actors and actresses, while others were drummers, singers and ticket sellers. All of the wives shared the stage with their husband at various points in the history of the theatre. The manager of the Ogunde Theater, who also happened to be one of the wives, was the former Miss Clementina Oguntimirin. She later became known as Adeshewa Clementina Ogunde or Mama Eko, taking the latter moniker from the popular 1960s play of the same name that she starred in. His other wives included Ibisomi Ogunde, Risikat Ogunde and Emily Kehinde Olukoga-Ogunde.

Wakkanai is the northernmost airport in Japan that is capable of handling jet aircraft; due to its small size, it is susceptible to closures during the coldest winter months, in which case incoming aircraft are often diverted to Asahikawa Airport. It has one jet bridge, one apron gate for mid-sized jet aircraft, and two apron gates for commuter aircraft. History Wakkanai Airport opened to passenger traffic in 1960, initially on an irregular basis. Air Nippon began scheduled service to Okadama Airport and Rishiri Airport in 1974, followed by Rebun Airport in 1978 and New Chitose Airport in 1980. Air Nippon discontinued the short Rebun and Rishiri commuter flights in 2003 due to poor load factors. In 1987, the 1,200 m main runway was extended to 1,800 m, allowing All Nippon Airways to begin jet service to Tokyo. The flight was initially seasonal and did not become a year-round service until 1997. The city of Wakkanai provided subsidies for city residents to use the flight until 2005, when discounted fares became available. As of 2015, ANA has two scheduled daily round trips to Sapporo using Bombardier Q400 turboprops, and one scheduled daily round trip to Tokyo (two from June to September) using Boeing 737 jets. Airlines and destinationsGround transportation The airport is located on Japan National Route 238 approx. 12 km from central Wakkanai. There is regular bus service to Wakkanai Station and Wakkanai Ferry Terminal, timed to coincide with ANA flight schedules. Until 1989, the JNR Temboku Line passed by the airport; however, the airport did not have a station on the line except for one day in June 1987, when a temporary Higashi- Koetoi Station was opened to accommodate visitors to the airport's extended runway.:ja:Êù±Â£∞ÂïèÈßÖ ReferencesExternal links * Wakkanai Airport Terminal (in Japanese) Category:Airports in Hokkaido ","title":"Wakkanai Airport"},{"id":"3559430","text":"Howard P. House, founder The House Ear Institute (HEI) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, based in Los Angeles, California, and dedicated to advancing hearing science through research, education, and global hearing health to improve quality of life.  History  Established in 1946 by Howard P. House, as the Los Angeles Foundation of Otology, and later renamed for its founder, the House Ear Institute has been engaged in the scientific exploration of the auditory system from the ear canal to the cortex of the brain for over 70 years. Since 1946, the House Ear Institute has led the way in defining the causes of hearing and balance disorders, improving medical/surgical procedures and prosthetic devices. The Institute's discoveries have helped millions of people receive successful treatments. House Ear Institute scientists have been involved in many firsts in the fields of otology, neurotology, skull base surgery, implantable auditory prostheses, and electrophysiology. They have developed techniques to improve hearing aids, diagnostic audiology, and clinical treatments for hearing loss. House Ear Institute researchers have always worked with the House Clinic physicians to integrate medicine and science through clinical and research trials that directly benefit patients. In 1969, William F. House, M.D.‚Äîbrother of Howard‚Äîimplanted the first three patients with the cochlear implant at House Ear Institute. William F. HouseSince then, the Institute has been regarded as the world's foremost private research institute for otology and hearing science. House Ear Institute's historical advancements in hearing sciences include the development of the first clinically useful cochlear implant and auditory brainstem implant as well as the introduction of the first the middle cranial fossa and then the translabyrinthine approach for removal of acoustic neuromas. The translabyrinthine approach uses the operating microscope and reduced mortality rates from 40% (in California) to less than 1%. It has also developed a variety of diagnostic tests, including the Hearing In Noise Test (HINT), the first hearing test that measures an individual's functional hearing ability in everyday environments where background noise is present, the ABaer screening device for detecting hearing loss in infants, and the Stacked ABR, a highly accurate screening device to detect the presence or absence of acoustic neuromas. The Institute shares its knowledge with the scientific and medical communities as well as the general public through its education and global hearing health programs. House Clinic physicians have volunteered their time to teach specialty courses in the House Ear Institute's professional education programs, attended by more than 22,000 doctors and research fellows since 1946 through the visiting physicians program. Through one week surgical temporal bone courses, thousands of doctors from every continent have come to study ear surgery. In June 2014, the House Ear Institute, at that time called the House Research Institute, went through bankruptcy proceedings and reorganization. The House Clinic Foundation, which acquired the House Research Institute, reorganized the structure of the nonprofit organization and established it again as the House Ear Institute. The current, threefold mission of the House Ear Institute is Education, Research, and Global Hearing Health. The Education projects of the Institute include the Neurotology Clinical Fellowship program performed in conjunction with the House Clinic; the Visiting Physicians program for worldwide doctors interested in ear surgery; and the Temporal Bone Surgical Dissection Courses. Research at the House Ear Institute currently involves collaborative research in the areas of Hearing Science (Dr. Sig Soli and collaborators), Auditory Implants (through collaboration with researchers at UCLA and Huntington Medical Research Institutes), and support of ongoing clinical trials performed by the House Clinic physicians and collaborators. Clinical and translational research projects are given high priority, with a focus on developing treatments that will directly benefit patients. Global Hearing Health is a new focus of HEI, through its own efforts in humanitarian otology (Neurotology Clinical Fellows spend a rotation on humanitarian worldwide otology) and through a collaboration with Global ENT Outreach. HEI partners also with the international arm of the American Academy of Otolaryngology Foundation, through the humanitarian committee, the Panamerican committee, and efforts by individual HEI scientists and physicians. Ongoing collaborative global health projects are underway in China, Ecuador, Peru, Malawi, and Paraguay.

It is strongly associated with functional analysis and operator algebras, but has also been studied in recent years from a more geometric and functorial perspective. There are two main challenges in this discipline. First, one must propose a set of axioms which describe the general properties of any mathematical object that deserves to be called a \\"quantum field theory\\". Then, one gives rigorous mathematical constructions of examples satisfying these axioms. Analytic approaches=Wightman axioms The first set of axioms for quantum field theories, known as the Wightman axioms, were proposed by Arthur Wightman in the early 1950s. These axioms attempt to describe QFTs on flat Minkowski spacetime by regarding quantum fields as operator-valued distributions acting on a Hilbert space. In practice, one often uses the Wightman reconstruction theorem, which guarantees that the operator-valued distributions and the Hilbert space can be recovered from the collection of correlation functions. Osterwalder‚ÄìSchrader axioms The correlation functions of a QFT satisfying the Wightman axioms often can be analytically continued from Lorentz signature to Euclidean signature. (Crudely, one replaces the time variable t with imaginary time \\\\tau = -\\\\sqrt{-1}t; the factors of \\\\sqrt{-1} change the sign of the time-time components of the metric tensor.) The resulting functions are called Schwinger functions. For the Schwinger functions there is a list of conditions‚Äîanalyticity, permutation symmetry, Euclidean covariance, and reflection positivity‚Äîwhich a set of functions defined on various powers of Euclidean space-time must satisfy in order to be the analytic continuation of the set of correlation functions of a QFT satisfying the Wightman axioms.

He was shot dead by IRA gunmen who were carrying out a raid on his girlfriend's farmhouse. Five members of the Provisional IRA were convicted of involvement in his murder.Lost Lives, McKittrick, Kelters, Feeney, Thornton & McVea, pp. 426-27; The Malcolm Sutton Index of Deaths states Fox was killed by the \\"Irish Republican Army\\", which, according to Sutton's categorisation, is \\"Provisional Irish Republican Army\\". (Official IRA killings are attributed to the \\"Official Irish Republican Army\\"). Political career A member of the Fine Gael party, Fox was first elected to Monaghan County Council in 1967, and as a Fine Gael Teachta D√°la (TD) to the 19th D√°il for the Monaghan constituency at the 1969 general election. He lost his seat at 1973 general election but later that year was elected to the 13th Seanad by the Cultural and Educational Panel. Fox was also one of a handful of members of the Oireachtas from the minority Protestant community.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat;=19740312&id;=j2o0AAAAIBAJ&sjid;=ZwoEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=788,2454926 Fox came to prominence when he campaigned against the British Army's cratering of border roads and its use of CS gas and rubber bullets. On one occasion, he brought CS gas canisters and rubber bullets into the D√°il chamber and berated the Fianna F√°il Government's policy on Northern Ireland. He was forcibly removed from the D√°il and the incident made front-page news. Death On the night of Monday 11 March 1974, about a dozen gunmen arrived at the home of Senator Fox's girlfriend, Marjorie Coulson.McKittrick, David. Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Random House, 2001. pp.426-427 She lived there with her parents and brother, and Senator Fox regularly visited on Monday evenings. The farmhouse was in the rural townland of Tircooney in County Monaghan, near the border with Northern Ireland. The gunmen searched the farmhouse and demanded the occupants hand over weapons. As this was taking place, Senator Fox drove down the laneway and was stopped by some of the gunmen who were outside. He ran, but was shot and killed by a single gunshot wound through the upper torso. The gunmen then ordered everyone out of the house, set it on fire, and escaped. The next day, the Ulster Freedom Fighters claimed that it had killed Senator Fox because he had links to the Provisional IRA. The IRA issued a statement saying that it was not involved, adding that \\"Mr Fox was known personally to a number of the leadership of the republican movement\\". However, shortly after the shooting, five men from County Monaghan were charged with Senator Fox's murder and IRA membership. They were convicted in May 1974 and sentenced to penal servitude for life. One of those convicted told the court they had raided the farm because they received a tip-off that UVF weapons were being stored there. He said there was an agreement that no shots were to be fired. His understanding was that Senator Fox had taken some of the men by surprise and they had shot to wound, not recognizing him. It was reported that the tip-off came from another local family and was the result of a grudge. IRA members were already suspicious that the UVF was receiving local help, following an incident in November 1973.\\"The crime and punishment of Michael Kinsella \\". Politico.ie. 1 October 1984.

The author Tim Pat Coogan, however, suggests that members of the Official IRA were responsible for killing Senator Fox.The IRA, Tim Pat Coogan, p. 357; .Tim Pat Coogan, Disillusioned Decades, Dublin: Gill & Macmillan, 1987. p520 ‚Äì . The Seanad adjourned for a week as a mark of respect. About 500 people attended his funeral at Aughnamullen, including the Taoiseach and the Irish president, Erskine Childers.

It has made more radio jingles than any other jingle company and has become part of American pop culture. History The company was founded in 1974 by husband and wife Jonathan M. and Mary Lyn Wolfert. Prior to the formation of JAM, Jon worked for PAMS which he now owns and was a fan of their work. Jon also worked briefly at TM Productions (now TM Studios) and did freelance work for several other studios. JAM is the only production house of its type which has been continuously owned and operated by its founders for over 40 years. It produces jingles for clients ranging from local DJs to the most influential radio stations in the world. WPEN and WMGK Philadelphia were among the company's earliest major-market clients. Within a few years, JAM jingles were used by many of the most listened-to radio stations of all time including WABC, WPLJ, and WHTZ in New York, WLS AM and WLS-FM in Chicago, KIIS AM & FM in Los Angeles, Jovem Pan, Jovem Pan FM, Transam√©rica FM,Metropolitana FM, R√°dio Globo and Manchete FM in Brazil and BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2 in London, UK. JAM also created themes and jingles for many syndicated radio programs, including those hosted by Casey Kasem, Dick Clark, Rick Dees, Dick Bartley, Bob Costas, Scott Shannon, Dan Ingram and others. In addition, JAM has worked for various TV clients including ABC, NBC (David Letterman), VH-1, GMA Network (Philippines), and more. Popularity In the UK, almost all jingles heard on BBC Radio 1 and 2 between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s were made by JAM. In the United States, JAM has produced more custom jingles for KOST in Los Angeles than any other station, although WLS in Chicago is very close. JAM's top-selling package has been \\"Warp Factor,\\" created for Z100 in 1985. Since 2001, both XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio (now Sirius-XM) make extensive use of JAM jingles on their music channels. In Brazil, JAM produced jingles for many stations, such as Jovem Pan, Transam√©rica FM, Metropolitana FM, Manchete FM and Atl√¢ntida. The majority of these stations used \\"resings\\" from packages like: Double Plus, Meltdown, Music Jam and One FM. JAM jingles have also been used in movies and TV shows to add authenticity to the era or location of a scene.

After this is done, the Green's functions are evaluated as a function of the background. This approach has the advantage that the gauge invariance is manifestly preserved if the approach is applied to gauge theory. Method We typically want to calculate expressions like : Z[J] = \\\\int \\\\mathcal D \\\\phi \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{i} \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^d x (\\\\mathcal L [\\\\phi(x)] + J(x) \\\\phi(x))\\\\right) where J(x) is a source, \\\\mathcal L(x) is the Lagrangian density of the system, d is the number of dimensions and \\\\phi(x) is a field. In the background field method, one starts by splitting this field into a classical background field B(x) and a field Œ∑(x) containing additional quantum fluctuations: : \\\\phi(x) = B(x) + \\\\eta(x) \\\\,. Typically, B(x) will be a solution of the classical equations of motion : \\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\delta S}{\\\\delta \\\\phi}\\\\right_{\\\\phi = B} = 0 where S is the action, i.e. the space integral of the Lagrangian density. Switching on a source J(x) will change the equations into Œ¥S/Œ¥œÜœÜ = B \\\\+ J = 0. Then the action is expanded around the background B(x): : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int d^d x (\\\\mathcal L [\\\\phi(x)] + J(x) \\\\phi(x)) & = \\\\int d^d x (\\\\mathcal L [B(x)] + J(x) B(x)) \\\\ & \\\\+ \\\\int d^d x \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\delta\\\\mathcal L}{\\\\delta \\\\phi(x)} [B] + J(x)\\\\right) \\\\eta(x) \\\\ & \\\\+ \\\\frac12 \\\\int d^d x d^d y \\\\frac{\\\\delta^2\\\\mathcal L}{\\\\delta \\\\phi(x) \\\\delta\\\\phi(y)} [B] \\\\eta(x) \\\\eta(y) + \\\\cdots \\\\end{align} The second term in this expansion is zero by the equations of motion. The first term does not depend on any fluctuating fields, so that it can be brought out of the path integral. The result is : Z[J] = e^{i \\\\int d^d x (\\\\mathcal L [B(x)] + J(x) B(x))} \\\\int \\\\mathcal D \\\\eta e^{\\\\frac i2 \\\\int d^d x d^d y \\\\frac{\\\\delta^2\\\\mathcal L}{\\\\delta \\\\phi(x) \\\\delta\\\\phi(y)} [B] \\\\eta(x) \\\\eta(y) + \\\\cdots}. The path integral which now remains is (neglecting the corrections in the dots) of Gaussian form and can be integrated exactly: : Z[J] = C e^{i \\\\int d^d x (\\\\mathcal L [B(x)] + J(x) B(x))} \\\\left(\\\\det \\\\frac{\\\\delta^2\\\\mathcal L}{\\\\delta \\\\phi(x) \\\\delta\\\\phi(y)} [B]\\\\right)^{-1/2} + \\\\cdots where \\"det\\" signifies a functional determinant and C is a constant. The power of minus one half will naturally be plus one for Grassmann fields. The above derivation gives the Gaussian approximation to the functional integral. Corrections to this can be computed, producing a diagrammatic expansion.

Carreg Gwalch, 2005 The station was one of many small ones on the line closed in February 1966 as a result of the Beeching Axe, but it reopened to passenger trains in March 1982 after a sustained lobbying campaign by local residents.Disused Stations - Valley Disused Stations Site Record; Retrieved 30 May 2017 The westbound platform and waiting room were both demolished after the initial closure, but replacements were constructed prior to reopening; the main buildings on the eastbound side survived during the closure period (along with the platform they stood on) and remain intact to this day.Valley railway station, Anglesey (2010) Wilson, L.S Geograph.org.uk; Retrieved 30 May 2017 The Grade II listed station signal box remains in use to supervise the B4545 level crossing here in addition to the aforementioned sidings. Since 6th July 2020, trains have not called at the station allegedly due to the short platform and the inability to maintain social distancing between passengers and the guard when opening the train door during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.https://tfwrail.wales/covid-19/changes-train-times Facilities The station is unstaffed (like all those between Bangor and Holyhead) and has no ticket machine, so all tickets have to be purchased prior to travel or on the train. Train running information is offered via a telephone, digital CIS displays and timetable posters. Step-free access is provided to both sides via the level crossing.Valley station facilities National Rail Enquiries  Services  There is a two-hourly weekday service in each direction from the station, with a few additional morning and evening departures. Most eastbound trains run to Wrexham General, Shrewsbury and Birmingham International, although a small number run to either Crewe or Cardiff. (Network Rail) The Sunday service is limited (six to Holyhead, seven towards Chester) and runs mainly to/from Crewe with one service to Wrexham and Cardiff. Trains only stop here on request.

Most fossils come from the Judith River Formation. Description Restoration Avaceratops was originally by Dodson considered to have been an exceptionally small species. He estimated the holotype length at and assumed it had almost attained adult size. However, the second skull (which does not necessarily belong to Avaceratops), MOR 692, indicates a body length of . Paul in 2010 estimated the weight of a four- metre-long animal at one tonne.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 264 Another change in the image of Avaceratops brought about by MOR 692 concerned the brow horns. These were first thought to be rather short, although this was purely speculative, the holotype not having preserved them. The new skull showed postorbital horn cores with a length of . Avaceratops has a distinctive frill at the back of the skull. The squamosal, the element at the front of the frill side, is large with a continuously curving instead of a stepped edge. A raised area at the base of the squamosal divides it into two equal halves, whereas more derived species have an enlarged top part. The squamosal is separated from the parietal bone at the rear of the skull by a small indentation. The parietals however, show no indentation at the midline of the frill rear. Also the parietals are probably lacking fenestrae which are typical of many other genera except Triceratops, resulting in a solid frill, although damage to the holotype allows for a small opening to be present. Discovery and naming The first remains of Avaceratops were found by fossil dealer Eddie Cole in the Judith River Formation of Montana, in 1981, on land of the Careless Creek Ranch, owned by rancher Arthur J. Lammers.\\"Avaceratops.\\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J. Michael & Weishampel, David B. The Age of Dinosaurs. Publications International, LTD. p. 129. . They were preserved scattered throughout the remains of a prehistoric stream bed. This Avaceratops specimen was likely buried in the sandbar after its body was swept downstream by the current. The finds, displayed in Cole's fossil shop, were in October 1981 inspected by Peter Dodson who in July 1982 during a visit with Cole to the site discovered additional bones, which from 1984 were excavated by Anthony Fiorillo. The fossil was formally named and described by Dodson in 1986, as the type species Avaceratops lammersi. It was the first ceratopsid named since Pachyrhinosaurus in 1950. The genus was named after Ava Cole, Eddie's wife. The specific epithet honors the Lammers family. In 1990 George Olshevsky emended the name to A. lammersorum, with the specific name in the genitive plural because it referred to several people.Olshevsky, G., 1991, A revision of the parainfraclass Archosauria Cope, 1869, excluding the advanced Crocodylia. Mesozoic Meanderings 2 196 pp However, Dodson objected against this change, arguing the genitive singular might also refer to a single family name. In 1990 Thomas Lehman renamed A. lammersi into Monoclonius lammersi;Lehman, T.M., 1990, \\"The ceratopsian subfamily Chasmosaurinae: sexual dimorphism and systematics\\". In: K. Carpenter and P. J. Currie (eds.), Dinosaur Systematics: Perspectives and Approaches, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge pp 211-229 This alternative name has found no acceptance. The holotype, ANSP 15800, consists of a partial skeleton containing the lower skull, a left lower jaw, vertebrae, a complete shoulder girdle and most elements of forelimbs and hindlimbs. The type specimen might represent a juvenile or a subadult individual, Dodson in 1986 being inclined to consider it almost fully grown. Kenneth Carpenter made a reconstruction of the skull, a cast of which was by Leroy Glenn combined with restored parts of the postcranial skeleton to create a mount that in 1986 was displayed in the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia; a copy of this skeletal mount was donated to the Upper Musselshell Valley Historical Museum in Harlowton. In 1993 Paul Penkalski referred two earlier found squamosals to Avaceratops, USNM 4802 and USNM 2415, of larger individuals.Penkalski, P.G., 1993, \\"The morphology of Avaceratops lammersi, a primitive ceratopsid from the Campanian of Montana\\". Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 13(3, suppl.): 52A In 1999, Penkalski and Dodson described a second skull, MOR 692, again of a larger individual. This specimen includes the upper skull, with the nose and brow horns. However, the assignment of the latter to Avaceratops has been questioned due to differences in relative chronological position, skull morphology, and lack of intermediate forms; thus, Avaceratops is only represented by the type specimen.  Classification  Restoration of two running specimens Avaceratops was by Dodson in 1986 assigned to the Ceratopsidae within the Ceratopsia (both names being derived from Ancient Greek for 'horned face'), a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in what are now North America and Asia, during the Cretaceous Period. Apart from being a ceratopsian, little is certain about Avaceratops's taxonomic position. Because most of the skeleton is only known from a juvenile, and juveniles tend to express ancestral traits more strongly, a cladistic analysis would likely indicate a too basal, low, position in the evolutionary tree. For this reason, Avaceratops has often been excluded from such analyses. Penkalski and Dodson in 1999 concluded that Avaceratops most likely occupied a basal position within the Centrosaurinae but that it was also possible it was a basal member of the Ceratopsinae or just outside the clade formed by both groups. A phylogenetic analysis performed by Sampson et al. (2013) found that Avaceratops was the sister taxon of the new genus Nasutoceratops, described and named in 2013. This clade containing both Avaceratops and Nasutoceratops was named the Nasutoceratopsini in 2016. The cladogram presented below follows a phylogenetic analysis by Chiba et al. (2017):  Paleobiology  Avaceratops, like all ceratopsians, was a herbivore. During the Cretaceous, flowering plants were \\"geographically limited on the landscape\\", so it is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns, cycads and conifers. It would have used its sharp ceratopsian beak to bite off the leaves or needles. The habitat of Avaceratops was heavily forested and wet.

It is an important Pancharatra text in the Vaishnavism literature corpus. The manuscripts of Vishnu Purana have survived into the modern era in many versions. More than any other major Purana, the Vishnu Purana presents its contents in Pancalaksana format ‚Äì Sarga (cosmogony), Pratisarga (cosmology), Vam≈õa (mythical genealogy of the gods, sages and kings), Manva√±tara (cosmic cycles), and Vam≈õƒÅnucaritam (legends during the times of various kings). Some manuscripts of the text are notable for not including sections found in other major Puranas, such as those on Mahatmyas and tour guides on pilgrimage, but some versions include chapters on temples and travel guides to sacred pilgrimage sites. The text is also notable as the earliest Purana to have been translated and published in 1864 CE by HH Wilson, based on manuscripts then available, setting the presumptions and premises about what Puranas may have been. The Vishnu Purana is among the shorter Purana texts, with about 7,000 verses in extant versions. It primarily centers around the Hindu god Vishnu and his avatars such as Krishna, but it praises Brahma and Shiva and asserts that they are one with Vishnu. The Purana, states Wilson, is pantheistic and the ideas in it, like other Puranas, are premised on the Vedic beliefs and ideas. Vishnu Purana, like all major Puranas, attributes its author to be sage Veda Vyasa. The actual author(s) and date of its composition are unknown and contested. Estimates range of its composition range from 1st millennium BCE to early 2nd-millennium CE. The text was likely composed and rewritten in layers over a period of time, with roots possibly in ancient 1st-millennium BCE texts that have not survived into the modern era. The Padma Purana categorizes Vishnu Purana as a Sattva Purana (Purana which represents goodness and purity).  Date of composition  Samudra manthanam depicted in above sculpture, is described in the Vishnu Purana. Suvarnabhumi Airport, Bangkok The composition date of Vishnu Purana is unknown and contested, with estimates widely disagreeing. Some proposed dates for the earliest version of Vishnu Purana by various scholars include: * Vincent Smith (1908): 400-300 BCE, * CV Vaidya (1925): ~9th-century, * Moriz Winternitz (1932): possibly early 1st millennium, but states Rocher, he added, \\"it is no more possible to assign a definite date to the Vishnu Purana than it is for any other Purana\\". * Rajendra Chandra Hazra (1940): 275-325 CE * Ramachandra Dikshitar (1951): 700-300 BCE, * Roy (1968): after the 9th century. * Horace Hayman Wilson (1864): acknowledged that the tradition believes it to be 1st millennium BCE text and the text has roots in the Vedic literature, but after his analysis suggested that the extant manuscripts may be from the 11th century. * Wendy Doniger (1988): 450 CE. Rocher states that the \\"date of the Vishnu Purana is as contested as that of any other Purana\\". References to Vishnu Purana in texts such as Brihadvishnu whose dates are better established, states Rocher, suggest that a version of Vishnu Purana existed by about 1000 CE, but it is unclear to what extent the extant manuscripts reflect the revisions during the 2nd millennium. Vishnu Purana like all Puranas has a complicated chronology. Dimmitt and van Buitenen state that each of the Puranas including the Vishnu Purana is encyclopedic in style, and it is difficult to ascertain when, where, why and by whom these were written: Many of the extant manuscripts were written on palm leaf or copied during the British India colonial era, some in the 19th century. The scholarship on Vishnu Purana, and other Puranas, has suffered from cases of forgeries, states Ludo Rocher, where liberties in the transmission of Puranas were normal and those who copied older manuscripts replaced words or added new content to fit the theory that the colonial scholars were keen on publishing. Structure The extant text comprises six a·πÉ≈õas (parts) and 126 adhyƒÅyas (chapters). The first part has 22 chapters, the second part consists 16 chapters, the third part comprises 18 chapters and the fourth part has 24 chapters. The fifth and the sixth parts are the longest and the shortest part of the text, comprising 38 and 8 chapters respectively. The textual tradition claims that the original Vishnu Purana had 23,000 verses, but the surviving manuscripts have just a third of these, about 7,000 verses. The text is composed in metric verses or sloka, wherein each verse has exactly 32 syllables, of which 16 syllables in the verse may be free style per ancient literary standards. The Vishnu Purana is an exception in that it presents its contents in Vishnu worship-related Pancalaksana format ‚Äì Sarga (cosmogony), Pratisarga (cosmology), Vam≈õa (mythical genealogy of the gods, sages and kings), Manva√±tara (cosmic cycles), and Vam≈õƒÅnucaritam (legends during the times of various kings). This is rare, state Dimmitt and van Buitenen, because just 2% of the known Puranic literature corpus is about these five Pancalaksana items, and about 98% is about diverse range of encyclopedic topics.  Contents  Vishnu Purana opens as a conversation between sage Maitreya and his guru, Parashara, with the sage asking, \\"what is the nature of this universe and everything that is in it?\\"\\"A Brief History of India\\", by Alain Dani√©lou, publisher = Inner Traditions / Bear & Co., p. 25 First a·πÉ≈õa: cosmology The first Amsha (part) of Vishnu Purana presents cosmology, dealing with the creation, maintenance and destruction of the universe. The mythology, states Rocher, is woven with the evolutionary theories of Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy. The Hindu god Vishnu is presented as the central element of this text's cosmology, unlike some other Puranas where Shiva or Brahma or goddess Shakti are. The reverence and the worship of Vishnu is described in 22 chapters of the first part as the means for liberation, along with the profuse use of the synonymous names of Vishnu such as Hari, Janardana, Madhava, Achyuta, Hrishikesha and others. The chapters 1.16 through 1.20 of the Vishnu Purana presents the legend of compassionate and Vishnu devotee Prahlada and his persecution by his demon king father Hiranyakasipu, wherein Prahlada is ultimately saved by Vishnu. This story is also found in other Puranas.Wendy Doniger (2000), Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions, Merriam-Webster, , page 455 Vishnu is described in the first book of Vishnu Purana as, translates Wilson, all elements, all matter in the world, the entire universe, all living beings, as well as Atman (Inner Self, essence) within every living being, nature, intellect, ego, mind, senses, ignorance, wisdom, the four Vedas, all that is and all that is not. Second a·πÉ≈õa: earth The second part of the text describes its theory of earth, the seven continents and seven oceans. It describes mount Meru, mount Mandara and other major mountains, as well as Bharata-varsha (literally, the country of Bharata) along with its numerous rivers and diverse people. The seven continents are named Jambu, Plaksha, Salmala, Kusha, Krauncha, Saka and Pushkara, each surrounded by different types of liquids (salt water, fresh water, wine, sugarcane juice, clarified butter, liquid yoghurt, and milk). This part of the Vishnu Purana describes spheres above the earth, planets, the sun and the moon. Four chapters (2.13 to 2.16) of the second book of the text present the legends of King Bharata, who abdicates his throne to lead the life of a sannyasi, which is similar to the legends found in section 5.7 to 5.14 of the Bhagavata Purana. The geography of Mount Mandara as east of Mount Meru, presented in this book and other Puranas, states Stella Kramrisch, may be related to the word Mandir (Hindu temple) and the reason of its design, \\"image, aim and destination\\". Third a·πÉ≈õa: time The initial chapters of the third book of the Vishnu Purana presents its theory of manvantaras, or Manus-ages (each equals about 4.3 million years). This is premised upon the Hindu belief that everything is cyclic, and even Yuga (era, ages) start, mature and then dissolve. Six manvantaras, states the text, have already passed, and the current age belong to the seventh. In each age, asserts the text, the Vedas are arranged into four, it is challenged, and this has happened twenty eight times already. Each time, a Veda-Vyasa appears and he diligently organizes the eternal knowledge, with the aid of his students. The Vishnu Purana includes several chapters in book 3 on rites of passage from birth through death. Included are chapters on cremation rites (above). After presenting the emergence of Vedic schools, the text presents the ethical duties of the four varnas in chapter 2.8, the four Ashrama (stages) of the life of each human being in chapter 2.9, the rites of passage including wedding rituals in chapters 2.10 through 2.12, and Shraddha (rites in honor of ancestors, faith) in chapters 2.13 through 2.16. The Vishnu Purana asserts that the Brahmin should study shastras, worship gods and perform libations on behalf of others, the Kshatriya should maintain arms and protect the earth, the Vaishya should engage in commerce and farming, while the Shudra should subsist by profits of trade, service other varnas and through mechanical labor. The text asserts the ethical duties of all varnas is to do good to others, never abuse anyone, never engage in calumny or untruth, never covet another person's wife, never steal another's property, never bear ill-will towards anyone, never beat or slay any human being or living being. Be diligent in the service of the gods, sages and guru, asserts the Purana, seek the welfare of all creatures, one's own children and of one's own soul. Anyone, regardless of their varna or stage of life, who lives a life according to the above duties is the best worshipper of Vishnu, claims the Vishnu Purana. Similar statements on ethical duties of man are found in other parts of Vishnu Purana.NK Devaraja (1976), What is living and what is dead in traditional Indian philosophy?, Philosophy East and West, Volume 26, Issue 4, pages 427-442, Quote: \\"Thus in the Visnu Purana, Prahlada, the great devotee of Visnu, is found making a number of statements of the following type: Knowing that god Visnu is present in all creatures - since neither the totality of living beings, nor myself, nor the food is other than Vi·π£·πáu - I serve all creatures with food; may this food bring them satisfaction. Elsewhere, in the same text, we read: We offer obeisance to that unborn, imperishable Brahman which is present in our and others bodies and in everything else, there being nothing other than it anywhere. This teaching of the ethics of universal love and service...\\" The text describes in chapter 2.9, the four stages of life as brahmacharya (student), grihastha (householder), vanaprastha (retirement) and sannyasa (renunciation, mendicant). The text repeats the ethical duties in this chapter, translates Wilson. The chapters on Shraddha (rites for ancestors) describe the rites associated with a death in family, the preparation of the dead body, its cremation and the rituals after the cremation. The third book closes with the legend of Vishnu, through Mayamoha, helping the Devas win over Asuras, by teaching the Asuras heretical doctrines that deny the Vedas, who declare their contempt for the Vedas, which makes them easy to identify and thereby defeat. The longest part of the Vishnu Purana is dedicated to the legend of Krishna (above). Fourth a·πÉ≈õa: dynasties The fourth book of the text, in 24 long chapters, presents mythical royal dynasties, starting with Brahma, followed by solar and lunar dynasties, then those on earth over the Yugas (eras), with Pariksit asserted as the \\"current king\\". The text includes the legends of numerous characters such as Shaubhri, Mandhatri, Narmada, sage Kapila, Rama, Nimi, Janaka, Buddha, Satyavati, Puru, Yadu, Krishna, Devaka, Pandu, Kuru, Bharata, Bhisma and others. Fifth a·πÉ≈õa: Krishna The fifth book of the Vishnu Purana is the longest, with 38 chapters. It is dedicated to the legend of Krishna, as an avatar of Vishnu. The book begins with the story of Krishna's birth, his childhood pranks and plays, his exploits, his purpose of ending the tyranny of demon-tyrant king of Mathura, named Kansa. The Krishna story in the Vishnu Purana is similar to his legend in the Bhagavata Purana, in several other Puranas and the Harivamsa of the Mahabharata. Scholars have long debated whether the Bhagavata Purana expanded the Krishna legend in the Vishnu Purana, or whether the latter abridged the version in former, or both depended on the Harivamsa estimated to have been composed sometime in the 1st millennium of the common era.Walter Ruben (1941), The K·πõ·π£·πáacarita in the Hariva·πÉ≈õa and Certain PurƒÅ·πáas, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 61, No. 3, pages 115-127 Sixth a·πÉ≈õa: liberation The last book of the Vishnu Purana is the shortest, with 8 chapters. The first part of the sixth book asserts that Kali Yuga is vicious, cruel and filled with evilness that create suffering, yet \\"Kali Yuga is excellent\\" because one can refuse to join the evil, devote oneself to Vishnu and thus achieve salvation. The last chapters, from 6.6 to 6.7 of the text discusses Yoga and meditation, as a means to Vishnu devotion. Contemplative devotion, asserts the text, is the union with the Brahman (supreme soul, ultimate reality), which is only achievable with virtues such as compassion, truth, honesty, disinterestedness, self-restraint and holy studies. The text mentions five Yamas, five Niyamas, Pranayama and Pratyahara. The pure and perfect soul is called Vishnu, states the text, and absorption in Vishnu is liberation. The final chapter 6.8 of the text asserts itself to be an \\"imperishable Vaishnava Purana\\". Influences Vishnu Purana is one of the 18 major Puranas, and these text share many legends, likely influenced each other. The fifth chapter of the Vishnu Purana was likely influenced by the Mahabharata. Similarly, the verses on rites of passage and ashramas (stages) of life are likely drawn from the Dharmasutra literature. Rajendra Hazra, in 1940, assumed that Vishnu Purana is ancient and proposed that texts such as Apasthamba Dharmasutra borrowed text from it. Modern scholars such as Allan Dahlaquist disagree, however, and state that the borrowing may have been in the other direction, from Dharmasutras into the Purana. Other chapters, particularly those in book 5 and 6 of the Vishnu Purana have Advaita Vedanta and Yoga influences.NK Devaraja (1970), Contemporary Relevance of Advaita VedƒÅnta, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 20, No. 2, pages 129-136KSR Datta (1978), The Visnu Purana and Advaita, Journal: Purana, Vol 20, pages 193-196 The theistic Vedanta scholar Ramanuja, according to Sucharita Adluri, incorporated ideas from the Vishnu Purana to identify the Brahman concept in the Upanishads with Vishnu, thus providing a Vedic foundation to the Srivaishnava tradition.Sucharita Adluri (2015), Textual authority in Classical Indian Thought: Ramanuja and the Visnu Purana, Routledge, , pages 1-11, 18-26 See also *Dvaita Vedanta *Hindu texts *Upanishad *Veda NotesReferences=Bibliography       Further reading *Mani, Vettam.

It lies in the Kumaon Himalaya, just outside the ring of peaks enclosing the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, southeast of Nanda Devi itself. The name Nanda Kot literally means \\"Nanda's Fortress\\" and refers to the abode of one of the sacred forms of the Hindu Goddess Parvati who in legend has made her sanctuary amongst the ring of lofty mountains in the region. Nanda Kot is connected to the Sanctuary wall by a high pass known as the Pindari Kanda, . This pass, Nanda Kot itself, and the ridge proceeding south from the peak together form the divide between the Pindar and Ghori Ganga River valleys, with Dana Dhura Pass connecting the two sides. The Kaphni (or Kafani), Pindar, Lawan, and Shalang Glaciers drain the south, west, north, and east sides of the peak respectively.Garhwal-Himalaya- Ost, 1:150,000 scale topographic map, prepared in 1992 by Ernst Huber for the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, based on maps of the Survey of India.

The first successful ascent of the summit came in 1936 by a Japanese team led by . A new route involving a direct ascent of the south face was successfully undertaken by a British expedition led by Martin Moran in 1995.

Shortly after delivery to the mountain, the thermonuclear generator designed to supply power to the sensor was lost during a storm and threatened to become a source of radioactive contamination to the area. Following upon at least three futile attempts between 1966-1968 to locate and recover the lost apparatus, it is said that in 1968 a similar device placed only the year before on Nanda Kot was dismantled. After more than a decade of secrecy, this story hit the Indian news media in 1978. There is still debate over these expeditions and whether any remnants of the radioactive materials remain in the vicinity of Nanda Kot to this day.

It is the absorbed energetic dose before the biological efficiency of the radiation is factored in. The rep has variously been defined as 83 or 93 ergs per gram of tissue (8.3/9.3 mGy) or per cm3 of tissue. At the time, this was thought to be the amount of energy deposited by 1 roentgen. Improved measurements have since found that one roentgen of air kerma deposits 8.77 mGy in dry air, or 9.6 mGy in soft tissue, but the rep was defined as a fixed number of ergs per unit gram. A 1952 handbook from the US National Bureau of Standards affirms that \\"The numerical coefficient of the rep has been deliberately changed to 93, instead of the earlier 83, to agree with L. H.

Yoichiro Nambu was awarded the 2008 Nobel prize in physics for describing Y. Nambu and G. Jona-Lasinio (1961), Dynamical Model of Elementary Particles Based on an Analogy with Superconductivity. I, Phys. Rev. 122, 345-358 this phenomenon (\\"for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in subatomic physics\\"). Overview=Quantum chromodynamics Experimentally, it is observed that the masses of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons (such as the pion) are much lighter than the next heavier states such as the octet of vector mesons, such as rho meson. This is a consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking of chiral symmetry in a fermion sector of QCD with 3 flavors of light quarks, u, d and s. Such a theory, for idealized massless quarks, has global chiral flavor symmetry. Under SSB, this is spontaneously broken to the diagonal flavor SU(3) subgroup, generating eight Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone bosons, which are the pseudoscalar mesons transforming as an octet representation of this flavor SU(3). Beyond this idealization of massless quarks, the actual small quark masses also break the chiral symmetry explicitly as well (providing non- vanishing pieces to the divergence of chiral currents, commonly referred to as PCAC: partially conserved axial currents). The masses of the pseudoscalar meson octet are specified by an expansion in the quark masses which goes by the name of chiral perturbation theory. The internal consistency of this argument is further checked by lattice QCD computations, which allow one to vary the quark mass and confirm that the variation of the pseudoscalar masses with the quark masses is as dictated by chiral perturbation theory, effectively as the square-root of the quark masses. For the three heavy quarks: the charm quark, bottom quark, and top quark, their masses, and hence the explicit breaking these amount to, are much larger than the QCD spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking scale. Thus, they cannot be treated as a small perturbation around the explicit symmetry limit. Mass generation Chiral symmetry breaking is most apparent in the mass generation of nucleons from more elementary light quarks, accounting for approximately 99% of their combined mass as a baryon. It thus accounts for most of the mass of all visible matter.Ta-Pei Cheng and Ling-Fong Li, Gauge Theory of Elementary Particle Physics, (Oxford 1984) ; For example, in the proton, of mass mp ‚âà 938 MeV, the valence quarks, two up quarks with mu ‚âà 2.3 MeV and one down quark with md ‚âà 4.8 MeV, only contribute about 9.4 MeV to the proton's mass. The source of the bulk of the proton's mass is quantum chromodynamics binding energy, which arises out of QCD chiral symmetry breaking. The idealized chiral limit of the nucleon mass is about 880 MeV, cf. . =Fermion condensate= The spontaneous symmetry breaking may be described in analogy to magnetization. A vacuum condensate of bilinear expressions involving the quarks in the QCD vacuum is known as the fermion condensate. It can be calculated as :\\\\langle \\\\bar{q}^a_R q^b_L \\\\rangle = v \\\\delta^{ab} ~, formed through nonperturbative action of QCD gluons, with v ‚âà ‚àí(250 MeV)3. This cannot be preserved under an isolated L or R rotation. The pion decay constant, ‚âà 93 MeV, may be viewed as a measure of the strength of the chiral symmetry breaking. Two-quark model For two light quarks, the up quark and the down quark, the QCD Lagrangian provides insight. The symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian, called chiral symmetry describes invariance with respect to a symmetry group U(2)_L \\\\times U(2)_R. This symmetry group amounts to :SU(2)_L \\\\times SU(2)_R \\\\times U(1)_V \\\\times U(1)_A ~. The quark condensate induced by nonperturbative strong interactions spontaneously breaks the SU(2)_L \\\\times SU(2)_R down to the diagonal vector subgroup SU(2)V, known as isospin. The resulting effective theory of baryon bound states of QCD (which describes protons and neutrons), then, has mass terms for these, disallowed by the original linear realization of the chiral symmetry, but allowed by the spontaneously broken nonlinear realization thus achieved as a result of the strong interactions.Gell-Mann, M., L√©vy, M., The axial vector current in beta decay, Nuovo Cim 16, 705‚Äì726 (1960). J Donoghue, E Golowich and B Holstein, Dynamics of the Standard Model, (Cambridge University Press, 1994) . The Nambu-Goldstone bosons corresponding to the three broken generators are the three pions, charged and neutral. The next section outlines how a small explicit breaking in the lagrangian gives these three pions a small mass. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons Pseudo-Goldstone bosons arise in a quantum field theory with both spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking, simultaneously. These two types of symmetry breaking typically occur separately, and at different energy scales, and are not thought to be predicated on each other. In the absence of explicit breaking, spontaneous symmetry breaking would engender massless Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone bosons for the exact spontaneously broken chiral symmetries. The chiral symmetries discussed, however, are only approximate symmetries in nature, given their small explicit breaking. The explicit symmetry breaking occurs at a smaller energy scale. The properties of these pseudo-Goldstone bosons can normally be calculated using chiral perturbation theory, expanding around the exactly symmetric theory in terms of the explicit symmetry-breaking parameters. In particular, the computed mass must be small,. The resulting generic formula for the mass of pseudogoldstone bosons in the presence of an explicit breaking perturbation is often called Dashen's formula, here m_\\\\pi^2 f_\\\\pi^2=-\\\\langle 0[Q_5,[Q_5,H 0\\\\rangle. . Three-quark model For three light quarks, the up quark, down quark, and strange quark, the flavor-chiral symmetries extending those discussed above also decompose, to Gell-Mann'sSee Current algebra. :SU(3)_L \\\\times SU(3)_R \\\\times U(1)_V \\\\times U(1)_A. The chiral symmetry generators spontaneously broken comprise the coset space (SU(3)_L \\\\times SU(3)_R)/SU(3)_V. This space is not a group, and consists of the eight axial generators, corresponding to the eight light pseudoscalar mesons, the nondiagonal part of SU(3)_L \\\\times SU(3)_R. The remaining eight unbroken vector subgroup generators constitute the manifest standard \\"Eightfold Way\\" flavor symmetries, SU(3)V. Heavy- light mesons Mesons containing a heavy quark, such as charm (D meson) or beauty, and a light anti-quark (either up, down or strange), can be viewed as systems in which the light quark is \\"tethered\\" by the gluonic force to the fixed heavy quark, like a ball tethered to a pole. The chiral symmetry breaking then causes the s-wave ground states (0^-,1^-) (spin^{parity}) to be split from p-wave parity partner excited states (0^+,1^+) by a common \\"mass gap,\\" \\\\Delta M . In 1993 William A. Bardeen and Christopher T. Hill studied the properties of these systems implementing both the heavy quark symmetry and the chiral symmetries of light quarks in a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model approximation. This described the phenomenon and gave a prediction of the mass gap of \\\\Delta M \\\\approx 345 MeV, which would be zero if the chiral symmetry breaking was turned off. The excited states of non-strange, heavy-light mesons are usually short-lived resonances due to the principal strong decay mode D(0^+,1^+)\\\\rightarrow \\\\pi+D(0^-,1^-), and are therefore hard to observe. In their paper, however, the authors remarked that though the results were approximate, the charm-strange excited mesons D_s(0^+,1^+) could be abnormally narrow (long-lived) since the principal decay mode, D_s(0^+,1^+)\\\\rightarrow K+D_{u,d}(0^-,1^-), could be kinematically suppressed (or altogether blocked) owing to the mass of the kaon. They could then be readily observed. In 2003 the D^*_s(2317) was discovered by the BABAR collaboration, and was seen to be surprisingly narrow, with a mass gap above the D_s of \\\\Delta M = 338 MeV, within a few percent of the Bardeen-Hill model prediction. Bardeen, Eichten and Hill immediately recognized that this was, indeed, the parity partner of the ground state, and predicted numerous observable decay modes, many of which have been subsequently confirmed by experiments. Similar predictions are expected in the B_s system (a strange and anti-beauty quark) and heavy-heavy-light baryons.

It was the morning show on Y107 from 5:30 am to 10:00 am. The duo has been known for frequent pranks and stunts, including Punishment Poker. On April Fool's Day 2011, they played Rebecca Black's \\"Friday\\" for an hour and a half until a local company called in and gave $3,000 to the Children's Miracle Network as long as they stopped playing the song. They came to Y107 from Mid-Missouri Broadcasting's KOQL (Q106.1), which is now owned by Cumulus. After joining Y107, ratings for the station have increased dramatically. According to on-air promos, Cosmo & JC in the Morning claimed to be number-one in the morning. It was replaced with Cosmo & Whitney in the Morning from 2011-2015, and continued on as Cosmo & Mike in the Morning from April 20, 2015 to June 3, 2016, until Mike left the market. Cosmo was solo until November, as Y107 launched a co-host for Cosmo promotion, sending out an open casting call, and on location auditions. Cosmo and the Y107 Morning Show On Nov. 12, 2016, the station started teasing that \\"mornings will never be the same\\" starting Monday, and Cosmo was completely removed from the website. Nov. 14 saw the launch of \\"Marilyn in the Morning\\" featuring a popular caller taking over the airwaves in pre-recorded segments and bits. On Nov. 15, \\"Marilyn in the Morning\\" was gone, but there were continuous static breaks into and after songs, with nearly inaudible people talking. Listener reaction generated speculation and rumors as to what happened to their beloved Cosmo, expressing the desire for his return. On Wednesday, November 16, Cosmo and the Y107 Morning Show was launched featuring Cosmo alongside newcomers Jax and Jaime.

He said he acted in response to concerns by agency employees who were uneasy \\"about various aspects of this program\\", who \\"had the feeling that what the agency was doing was fundamentally inconsistent with past US government policy and American values\\" and because \\"a critical legal opinion was missing\\". A 12-man team worked for over a year, interviewed more than 100 persons, visited all black sites, watched every minute of any existing videotape and reviewed more than 38,000 documents. Helgerson said, \\"the review was difficult because of the disorganization of the whole interrogation program. So much was being improvised in those early years in so many locations. There were no guidelines, no oversight, no training.\\" It took 6 months to write the report until the end of 2003. This was followed by redaction and publication in May 2004. It was reviewed at the White House, at the Department of Justice and within the CIA. Helgerson personally briefed it to senior members of Congress and the vice president. When asked if he thought the methods were effective he said: > I can say that up to this day I do not know whether the particular > interrogation techniques used were effective and necessary, or whether such > information could be acquired using more traditional methods. In September 2005, Helgerson's critical review of George Tenet's tenure that recommended \\"punitive sanctions\\" was delivered to the United States Congress. After the Obama administration began an investigation of the CIA procedures, Helgerson predicted that Eric Holder \\"will find it is not feasible to prosecute anyone who participated in the approved program\\". In December 2005, press reports quoting unnamed CIA sources stated that Helgerson was investigating \\"erroneous extraordinary renditions\\" - that is the extrajudicial kidnapping, for the purpose of extreme interrogation, of suspected enemies, like Maher Arar and Khalid El-Masri, who turned out to be completely innocent. In October 2007, CIA director Michael Hayden launched an inquiry into Helgerson's conduct as Inspector General of the CIA, conducted by Hayden's senior counsel Robert Deitz. In 2009, the report on CIA interrogations was ordered released by a US judge. The report described, and strongly criticized the use of harsh interrogation techniques against detainees. Helgerson retired from the CIA in 2009 after a 38 year career at the agency. Bibliography * John L.

The term 'Bicycle monarchy' is often used in a pejorative sense by newspapers in the United Kingdom, reflecting a pride in the pomp and ceremony of the British monarchy.\\"Picture a thoroughly modern monarch\\". 16 July 2003. The Northern Echo. URL accessed 20 May 2006.

BBC News. URL accessed 20 May 2006. Origin There are two conflicting claims of the origin of the epithet: one deriving from the Dutch monarchy and the other from the Danish monarchy.e-cyclopaedia: Bicycling monarchy. 9 April 2001. BBC News. The version involving the Netherlands has its roots in Queen Juliana's love of riding bicycles, even during her reign. Although Juliana would still perform official ceremonies, she was more famous in the United Kingdom for her frequent, unscheduled appearances with members of the public. Her daughter, Queen Beatrix, has also been sighted on her bicycle (although less often than her mother), perpetuating \\"bicycle monarchy\\" image in foreign imagination. The possible reference to the Danish monarchy stems from the Nazi occupation of Denmark during World War II. The non-hostile relationship between the governments of Denmark and Germany prompted accusations of collaboration. In a show of solidarity with the Danish people in the face of such claims, the future King Frederick IX and his wife Ingrid began taking bicycle rides around Copenhagen. Whoever gave rise to the term, it was not a result of either poverty or lack of constitutional authority. For example, the Dutch monarch, to whom the term is most frequently applied, retains full royal prerogative powers and has a personal wealth of $250 million.\\"Dutch royalty denies billionaire status\\". 23 June 2003.

They also published comic books and sporting yearbooks. Among their many titles was the science fiction pulp magazine Astounding Stories, acquired from Clayton Magazines in 1933, and retained until 1961. Street & Smith was founded in 1855, and was bought out in 1959. The Street & Smith headquarters was at 79 Seventh Avenue in Manhattan; it was designed by Henry F. Kilburn.  History =Founding Francis Scott Street and Francis Shubael Smith began their publishing partnership in 1855 when they took over a broken-down fiction magazine.\\"The Press: New Bottles,\\" Time (Monday, August 20, 1945).

The company, which owned a six- story building at 79 Seventh Avenue (just above 14th Street), became a publisher of inexpensive novels and weekly magazines starting in the 1880s and continuing into 1959. In the early decades of the 20th century, Ormond V. Gould was the company secretary.\\"Ormond V. Gould, Publisher's Aide; Retired Secretary of Street & Smith Is Dead at 70,\\" New York Times (May 20, 1962). Ormond Smith remained company president until his death in 1933. In 1933, Street & Smith bought titles from Clayton Magazines, including Astounding Stories. In 1934 they put out 35 different magazines, looked after by about a dozen editors, including John Nanovic, Frank Blackwell, Daisy Bacon and F. Orlin Tremaine. The company paid one cent a word, which was standard base rate among the major publishing groups, though fringe publishers paid less. In 1937, Street & Smith discontinued a number of their pulp titles, including Top-Notch and Complete Stories, the start of a long-term shrinking of their pulp line. In 1938, Allen L. Grammer became president. He had spent more than twenty years as an ergonomics expert for Curtis Publishing Company, and made a small fortune inventing a new printing process. He moved the offices into a skyscraper. Street & Smith published comic books from 1940‚Äì1949, their most notable titles being The Shadow, from their pulp magazine line, Super-Magician Comics, Supersnipe Comics, True Sport Picture Stories, Bill Barnes/Air Ace and Doc Savage Comics, also from pulp magazine line. Demise Street & Smith stopped publishing all their pulps and comics in 1949, selling off several of their titles to Popular Publications. Sales had declined with the advent of television.\\"Street & Smith Giving Up 'Pulps'; Oldest Publishers of Thriller Magazines Also Scuttling Their Comic Books\\". The New York Times (April 9, 1949). Street & Smith continued to publish Astounding Science Fiction well into the late 1950s.

The original village of Grand Pr√© extended four kilometres along the ridge between present-day Wolfville and Hortonville. Grand-Pr√© is listed as a World Heritage Site and is the main component of two National Historic Sites of Canada.  History of Settlement Grand-Pr√© (French for great meadow) is located on the shore of the Minas Basin, an area of tidal marshland, first settled about 1680 by Pierre Melanson dit La Verdure, his wife Marguerite Mius d'Entremont and their five young children who came from nearby Port-Royal which was the first capital of the French settlement of Acadia (Acadie in French). Pierre Melanson and the Acadians who joined him in Grand-Pr√© built dykes there to hold back the tides along the Minas Basin. They created rich pastures for their animals and fertile fields for their crops. Grand-Pr√© became the bread basket of Acadia, soon outgrew Port-Royal, and by the mid-18th century was the largest of the numerous Acadian communities around the Bay of Fundy and the coastline of Nova Scotia (Latin for \\"New Scotland\\").  Colonial Wars During Queen Anne's War, the Raid on Grand Pr√© (1704) happened and Major Benjamin Church burned the entire village. After the war, in 1713, part of Acadia became Nova Scotia, and Port-Royal, now called Annapolis Royal, became its capital. Over the next 40 years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to the British crown. Some were motivated not to sign for fear of losing their religion, some were afraid of repercussions from their native allies, some did not want to take up arms against the French and others were anti-British (see Military history of the Acadians). During King George's War the French made numerous attempts to regain Acadia (See Siege of Annapolis Royal (1744) and in 1745). As a result of British attempts to secure their control over the Bay of Fundy region, they were defeated by some local Acadians, Mi'kmaq and Canadiens in the Battle of Grand Pre. Acadian Memorial Cross, at nearby Hortonville, marking the location of the deportation and the site of Fort Vieux Logis Father Le Loutre's War began with the establishment of Halifax, which became the new capital for the colony in 1749. The British established Fort Vieux Logis at Grand Pre, which a Mi'kmaq and Acadian militia attacked in the Siege of Grand Pre. During the French and Indian War, the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg and the Mi'kmaq by deporting Acadians from Acadia. ‚Ä¢ After the Battle of Fort Beaus√©jour, the British began the removal of the Acadians. During the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755), Lieutenant Colonel John Winslow arrived in Grand-Pr√© with troops on August 19, 1755 and took up headquarters in the church. Winslow also built a palisade, which was recently uncovered through archeological research. The men and boys of the area were ordered into the church on September 5. Winslow informed them that all but their personal goods were to be forfeited to the Crown and that they and their families were to be deported as soon as ships arrived to take them away. (At exactly the same time, the Acadians in the neighbouring village of Pisiguit were informed of the same declaration at Fort Edward.) Some Acadians escaped the deportation and continued their armed resistance against the British throughout the expulsion campaigns. Before the first year was over, however, more than 6,000 Acadians were deported from the Bay of Fundy region. Many villages were burned to the ground to ensure the Acadians would not be able to return. Thousands more would be deported in the second wave of the Expulsion of the Acadians, which involved the deportation of the Acadians from Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island (1758). The deportation continued until England and France made peace in 1763. In all, 12,000 Acadians were deported. Many Acadians died from drowning, starvation, imprisonment, and exposure. Evangeline When the poem, Evangeline, by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was published in the United States in 1847, the story of the Deportation and le Grand D√©rangement, the great uprooting, was told to the English-speaking world. Grand-Pr√©, forgotten for almost a century, became popular for American tourists who wanted to visit the birthplace of the poem's heroine, Evangeline. But nothing remained of the original village except the dykelands and a row of old willows. There is a bust of Henry W. Longfellow on site by Sir Thomas Brock. In 2018, Canadian historian and novelist A. J. B. Johnston published a YA novel entitled The Hat, inspired by what happened at Grand-Pr√© in 1755. There is no reference to Evangeline in the novel. The focus instead is on two fictional characters, 14-year old Marie and 10-year old Charles. Preservation of the site=John Frederic Herbin In 1907, John Frederic Herbin, poet, historian, and jeweller, and whose mother was Acadian, purchased the land believed to be the site of the church of Saint-Charles so that it might be protected. The following year the Nova Scotia legislature passed an act to incorporate the Trustees of the Grand-Pr√© Historic Grounds. Herbin built a stone cross on the site to mark the cemetery of the church, using stones from the remains of what he believed to be Acadian foundations. Dominion Atlantic Railway Herbin sold the property to the Dominion Atlantic Railway in 1917 on the condition that Acadians be involved in its preservation. Acadian history had already become a staple for tourism traffic on the Dominion Atlantic and the Grand Pre site was located beside the railway's mainline. The railway made substantial investments in developing the park and promoting the history and lore of Acadians. Extensive gardens were planted at the site and a small museum was opened. In 1920 the Dominion Atlantic erected a statue of Evangeline conceived by Canadian sculptor Louis- Philippe H√©bert and, after his death, finished by his son Henri. The railway deeded a piece of the land and funds were raised to build a memorial church in Grand-Pr√©. Construction began in the spring of 1922 and the exterior was finished by November. The interior of the church was finished in 1930, the 175th anniversary of the Deportation, and the church opened as a museum. Parks Canada As railway tourism declined in the face of subsidized highway construction, the Dominion Atlantic sold the park to the Canadian federal government in 1957. The Canadian Parks Service took over operation of the park. It was designated a National Historic Site in 1982. The Visitor Reception and Interpretation Center features exhibits about the history of Grand-Pr√© and Acadia. A video presentation presents the story of the Acadian deportation. Archaeological activities Grand-Pr√© National Historic Site is also the location of an archaeological site sponsored by St. Mary‚Äôs University, Parks Canada, and Soci√©te Promotion Grand-Pr√©. While excavations have been undertaken by Parks Canada since 1971, the field school has been operational for ten years, during which archaeologists have identified the cemetery for the Acadian period, the cellar of an Acadian house immediately to the east of the Memorial Church, and has conducted test pits throughout the site looking for evidence of the parish church, St-Charles-des-Mines; Pierre- Alain Bugeauld (Bujold) was the Church Warden [Marguillier aux Mines]; was also a Notary (1706) and a Judge/Justice (1707). Acadian artefacts that have been unearthed include fragments of Saintonge ceramic, nails, wine bottle glass, window pane glass, a 1711 French silver coin, spoons, belt buckles, buttons, clay pipes, etc. There seems to also be evidence of the occupation by New England troops, as well as considerable evidence of the New England Planter occupation period beginning in 1760.Glen Parker. \\"Treasures of Grand Pre\\".

Vayu Purana is mentioned in the manuscripts of the Mahabharata and other Hindu texts, which has led scholars to propose that the text is among the oldest in the Puranic genre. Vayu and Vayaviya Puranas do share a very large overlap in their structure and contents, possibly because they once were the same, but with continuous revisions over the centuries, the original text became two different texts, and the Vayaviya text came also to be known as the Brahmanda Purana. The Vayu Purana, according to the tradition and verses in other Puranas, contains 24,000 verses (shlokas). However, the surviving manuscripts have about 12,000 verses. The text was continuously revised over the centuries, and its extant manuscripts are very different. Some manuscripts have four padas (parts) with 112 chapters, and some two khandas with 111 chapters. Comparisons of the diverse manuscripts suggest that the following sections were slipped, in later centuries, into the more ancient Vayu Purana: chapters on geography and temples-related travel guides known as Mahatmya, two chapters on castes and individual ashramas, three chapters on Dharma and penances, eleven chapters on purity and Sanskara (rite of passage) and a chapter on hell in after-life. The text is notable for the numerous references to it, in medieval era Indian literature, likely links to inscriptions such as those found on the Mathura pillar and dated to 380 CE, as well as being a source for carvings and reliefs such as those at the Elephanta Caves ‚Äì a UNESCO world heritage site. History The Vayu Purana is mentioned in chapter 3.191 of the Mahabharata, and section 1.7 of the Harivamsa, suggesting that the text existed in the first half of the 1st-millennium CE. The 7th-centuryBanabhatta Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2012) Sanskrit prose writer Banabhatta refers to this work in his Kadambari and Harshacharita. In chapter 3 of the Harshacharita Banabhatta remarks that the Vayu Purana was read out to him in his native village.Hazra, R.C. (1962). The Puranas in S. Radhakrishnan ed. The Cultural Heritage of India, Vol.II, Calcutta: The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, , pp.253‚Äì5 Alberuni (973 -1048), the Persian scholar who visited and lived in northwest Indian subcontinent for many years in early 11th century, quoted from the version of Vayu Purana that existed during his visit. The various mentions of the Vayu Purana in other texts have led scholars to recognize it as one of the oldest. The early 20th-century scholar Dikshitar, known for his dating proposals that push many texts as very ancient and well into 1st millennium BCE, stated that the Vayu Purana started to take shape around 350 BCE. Later scholarship has proposed that the earliest version of the text is likely from the 300 to 500 CE period, and broadly agreed that it is among the oldest Puranas. The text, like all Puranas, has likely gone through revisions, additions and interpolations over its history. Rajendra Hazra, as well as other scholars, for example, consider Gaya-mahatmya, which is an embedded travel guide to Gaya, as a later addition. The Gaya-mahatmya replaced older sections of the Vayu Purana, sometime before the 15th century. Vayu Purana, like all Puranas, has a complicated chronology. Dimmitt and van Buitenen state that each of the Puranas is encyclopedic in style, and it is difficult to ascertain when, where, why and by whom these were written: Editions and translations The Asiatic Society, Calcutta published this text in two volumes in 1880 and 1888, as a part of their Bibliotheca Indica series. It was edited by Rajendralal Mitra. The Venkateshvara Press, Bombay edition was published in 1895. It was followed by the publication of another edition by the Anandashrama (Anandashrama Sanskrit Series 49), Poona. In 1910, the Vangavasi Press, Calcutta published an edition along with a Bengali translation by Panchanan Tarkaratna, the editor of the text. In 1960 Motilal Banarsidass published an English translation as part of its Ancient Indian Traditions and Mythology series.Tagare, G.V. and Shastri, J.L (ed.) (1960) The VƒÅyu PurƒÅ·πáa (2 volumes). Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass. Contents The Vayu Purana exists in many versions, structured in different ways, For example: *In the Anandashrama and Vangavasi editions, this text is divided into four padas (parts): Prakriya-pada (chapters 1‚Äì6), Anushanga-pada (chapters 7‚Äì64), Upodghata-pada (chapter 65‚Äì99) and Upasamhara-pada (chapters 100‚Äì112). The Gayamahatmya (chapters 105‚Äì112 in these editions), praising the Gaya tirtha in Magadha is not found in all the manuscripts of this work and also found separately as an independent work. *In the Asiatic Society and Venkateshvara Press editions, this text is divided into two parts: Prathamakhanda comprising 61 chapters and Dvitiyakhanda comprising 50 chapters. The chapters 1-6 of Prathamakhanda are titled Prakriya-pada and no title is provided for the chapters 7-61. The chapters 1-42 of Dvitiyakhanda are titled Anushanga-pada and the chapters 43-50 are the Gayamahatmya. The Vayu Purana discusses its theories of cosmology, genealogy of gods and kings of solar and lunar dynasties, mythology, geography, manvantaras, the solar system and the movements of the celestial bodies. In addition to these, the text has chapters which were inserted in the later centuries into the older version of the Vayu Purana, such as chapters 16-17 which discuss duties of the Varna (caste or class) and duties of a person during various Ashrama (stages such as Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha and Sannyasa), chapter 18 which discusses penances for sannyasi (monks, yati), chapters 57‚Äì59 on dharma, chapters 73 to 83 on sanskaras (rites of passage), and chapter 101 on the theory of hell in after-life. The text shares a large number of verses with the Brahmanda Purana, and the two texts originated most likely from the same core text. The comparison of the two texts and specifics within the texts suggests, states Hazra, that the split into two texts could not have happened before 400 CE. The chapters which were slipped into the Vayu Purana are missing in many versions of Vayu and in Brahmananda manuscripts. Chapter 18 on penances for those in monastic life, was likely inserted before the 14th century. The travel guide to Gaya, Bihar was likely inserted before the 15th-century, because the Gaya-mahatmya was referenced many times by the 15th-century Vacaspatimisra (not to be confused with 9th-century Advaita scholar of the same name). The text also contains chapters on music,Vayu Purana, G.V. Tagare, Vol 2, pages 666-671 various shakhas of the Vedas, Pashupata-Yoga, and geographic Mahatmya (travel guides) particularly about Gaya in Bihar. The Vayu Purana also features other topics such as those dealing with construction of mountain top Hindu temples. The Revakhanda of Vayu Purana since 1910 has been wrongly attributed to the Skanda Purana, says Juergen Neuss, but he adds that the manuscripts attest the Revakhanda containing 232 chapters belongs to the Vayu Purana and was wrongly included in the Skanda Purana by Ve·πÖkate≈õvara Steam Press in 1910 and all publications of the Skanda after it. The one belonging to the Skanda Purana has 116 chapters.Jurgen Neuss, Oliver Hellwig, Revakhanda of the Vayupurana References=Bibliography    * * External links * Vayu Purana - English Translation by G.V.Tagare - Part 1 * Vayu Purana - English Translation by G.V.Tagare - Part 2 Category:Puranas Category:Shaiva texts ","title":"Vayu Purana"},{"id":"3559678","text":"The rutherford (symbol Rd) is a non-SI unit of radioactive decay.

History since Alexander=Alexander the Great and Ashoka the Great Alexander the Great, after conquering parts of the Northern Punjab, established his rule over a large part of Hazara. In 327 B.C., Alexander handed the area over to Abisaras (ŒëŒ≤ŒπœÉŒ±œÅŒ∑œÇ), the raja of Poonch state. Hazara remained a part of the Taxila administration during the rule of the Maurya dynasty. Ashoka the Great was the governor of the area when he was a prince. After the death of his father Bindusara around 272 B.C., Ashoka inherited the throne and ruled this area as well as Gandhara. Today, the Edicts of Ashoka inscribed on three large boulders near Bareri Hill serve as evidence of his rule there. The Mansehra rocks record fourteen of Ashoka's edicts, presenting aspects of the emperor's dharma or righteous law, and represent the earliest irrefutable evidence of writing in South Asia. Dating to middle of the third century BC, they are written from right to left in the Kharosthi script.UNESCO World Heritage Centre - Mansehra Rock Edicts Hazara has several places of significance for the Hindus related to the Pandavas: In the 2nd century CE, a mythical king Raja Risalu, son of Raja Salbahan of Sialkot, supposedly brought the area under his control. The local people consider him as a popular folk hero. When a Chinese pilgrim, Hiun-Tsang, visited this area, it was under the control of Raja Durlabhavardhana, the ruler of Kashmir. The Shahi dynasties ruled Hazara one after another. Among the Hindu Shahi dynasty rulers, Raja Jayapala is the best known. Mehmood of Ghazni defeated Raja Jayapala during his first campaign. However, there is no historical evidence that Mehmood of Ghazni ever visited or passed through Mansehra. After the fall of the Shahi dynasty, in the 11th century, the Kashmiris took control of the area under the leadership of Kalashan (1063 to 1089). From 1112 to 1120, King Susala ruled the area. In the 12th century, Asalat Khan captured this area but soon after Mohammad of Ghor's death the Kashmiris once again regained control of Hazara. Amb and its surrounding areas of Hazara have a long history which can be traced to Alexander the Great's invasion of India. Arrian, Alexander's historian, did not indicate the exact location of Embolina, but since it is known that Aoronos was on the right bank of the River Indus, the town chosen to serve as Alexander's base of supplies may with good reason be also looked for there. The mention in Ptolemy's Geography of Embolima as a town of Indo-Scythia situated on the Indus supports this theory. Turkic rule Akbar as a boy around 1557 In 1399, the Muslim warrior Timur, on his return to Kabul, stationed his Turk soldiers (who belonged to a sub-tribe of Turks, called Karlugh Turks) in Hazara to protect the important route between Kabul and Kashmir. By 1472, Prince Shahab-ud-Din came from Kabul and established his rule over the region. At the beginning of the 18th century, Turkish rule came to an end due to the increased aggression of the Swatis and their allied forces. The most crucial attack was that of the Swatis in collusion with Syed Jalal Baba in 1703. Syed Jalal Shah was the son in law of the last ruler of Turkic dynasty, Thus Swatis ousted the Turks and captured this area.Hazara Gazetteer 1883-84Tareekh e Hazara During the period of Mughal rule, local Turkish chiefs acknowledged Mughal authority. In fact, Mansehra provided the main route to Kashmir and was the most commonly used route for Emperor Akbar to travel to Kashmir. Durrani rule Hazara remained part of the Afghan Durrani Empire from the mid-18th to the early 19th centuries. Durranis considered it wise to rule the region through the local tribal chiefs. The lower Hazara plain was a separate administrative region attached to the Chacch and Attock areas of Northern Punjab whereas most of upper Hazara was attached to the Durrani 'Subah' or governorship of Kashmir, with the exception of the Tanawal Ilaqa (Amb) or area, which paid liege homage or tribute in exchange for comparative independence. This 'Subah' or governorship was ruled by Suba Khan Tanoli during Afghan Durrani Empire.Hazara Gazetteer 1883-84 British rule After the First Sikh War, under the terms of the Treaty of Lahore, the area was governed by Major James Abbott. Abbott managed to secure and pacify the area within a year. During the Second Sikh War Abbott and his men were cut off by the Sikh army from supplies and reinforcements from the rest of the British Army, but were able to maintain their position.Charles Allen, Soldier- Sahibs: The Men who made the North-West Frontier, London: Abacus, 2001. pp. 193-195. By 1849, the British had gained control of all of Hazara. However, the western Pashtun tribes were occasionally rebellious. These tribes included the Swati clans of Allai, Batagram in the Nandhiar valley, The Black Mountain (Tor Ghar) Tribes. The British sent many expeditions against these tribes to crush several uprisings between 1852 and the 1920s. The British divided Hazara District into three Tehsils (administrative subdivisions): Mansehra, Abbottabad, and Haripur and annexed it to the Punjab. In 1901, when the North- West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) was formed, Hazara was separated from Punjab and made a part of NWFP. Hazara Muslim League From the early 1930s onwards, the people of Hazara gradually became active in the freedom movement for an independent Pakistan under the active leadership of renowned All India Muslim League leaders such as Shanshah e Muazzam Abdul Majid Khan Tarin of Talokar (1877‚Äì1939), an early member of the (then) Frontier Legislative Assembly, and others. Even before the All-India Muslim League started its movement for Pakistan in 1937, after the historic Lucknow Session of October that year, the Hazara Muslim League was properly formed and convened at the residence of Noor-Ud-Din Qureshi in Abbottabad in 1936. In this meeting the leaders of the All-India Muslim League, Nawab Bahadur Yar Jang, Maulana Shaukat Ali, Hamid Badayuni and others, came from India. The local people joined the movement in large numbers. In Mansehra, in the same year the Muslim League was organised by Ali Gohar Khan of Chitti Dheri and Hakim Abdul Karim, who were elected the first president and general secretary of the tehsil Mansehra Muslim League. During the final phase of the movement for the creation of Pakistan, Captain Sardar Zain Muhammad Khan, OBI, and Jalal-ud-din Jalal Baba defeated their Congress rivals in the elections of 1946 from their respective rural and urban Constituencies, and politically routed the All India Congress from the region. In the Delhi Convention of Muslim League parliamentarians chaired by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, which finally voted for the division of India and the creation of Pakistan, Capt. Sardar Zain Muhammad Khan represented Hazara. These Muslim League Leaders were also able to mobilize the people of this area in favour of the referendum for the creation of Pakistan. Jalal Baba, who was the main force behind Referendum in Hazara, served as the President of District Muslim League for 22 years. Khan Jalaluddin Khan (Jalal Baba) Sometime before the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Nawab Muhammad Farid Khan Tanoli (KBE) of Amb State also developed good relations with Jinnah and Nawabzada Liaqat Ali Khan as a politic move. His correspondence and letters to and from Jinnah are available in Pakistan's archival records.Quaid-I-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah Papers: First Series, Volume III: On the Threshold of Pakistan, July 1‚Äì25, 1947 By Mahomed Ali Jinnah, Series Editor, Prof Dr Z.

The areas around Abbottabad and Mansehra became the Hazara District of Peshawar Division, whilst areas to the north of this became the Hazara Tribal Agency. Sandwiched between Hazara Tribal Agency and Hazara District were the small princely states of Amb and Phulra. This system of administration continued until 1950, when these two small states were incorporated into the Hazara district.

Darband, Amb State, 1949. From 1955 to 1970, NWFP province became part of West Pakistan under the One Unit policy, with the Hazara district forming part of the Peshawar Division of West Pakistan. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly here on 21 March 2014 passed a resolution demanding the creation of the Hazara province. Hazara Division 1970‚Äì2000 On the dissolution of West Pakistan in 1970, Hazara District and the two tribal agencies were merged to form the new Hazara Division with its capital at Abbottabad. The division was initially composed of two districts (Abbottabad, and Mansehra) but within a few years, Haripur district was spun off from Abbottabad District and Batagram District was spun off from Mansehra District. Hazara remained a district until its conversion into a division in 1976. In October 1976, Mansehra was given the status of a full-fledged district, which consisted of Mansehra and Batagram tehsils. Subsequently, in July 1991, Haripur Tehsil was separated from Abbottabad and made into a district. Thus only the old Tehsil of Abbottabad remained, which was declared as Abbottabad District. In 2000, administrative divisions were abolished and the fourth-tier districts were raised to become the new third tier of government in Pakistan. At abolition it contained the following districts:Divisions/Districts of Pakistan Note: Although divisions as an administrative structure has been abolished, the election commission of Pakistan still groups districts under the division names * Abbottabad District * Batagram District * Haripur District * Upper Kohistan District (part of Kohistan District until 2014) * Lower Kohistan District (part of Kohistan District until 2014) * Mansehra District * Torghar District (part of Mansehra District until 2011) Eventually, with all the administrative divisions being restored back in 2008, Hazara Division has returned. Geography and climate Tilla Charouni is on the border between Hazara and Islamabad capital territory Hazara is bounded on the north and east by the Northern Areas and Azad Kashmir. To the south are the Islamabad Capital Territory and the province of Punjab, whilst to the west lies the rest of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The river Indus runs through the division in a north‚Äìsouth line, forming much of the western border of the division. The total area of Hazara is 18,013 km2. Because it lies immediately south of the main Himalayan range, and is exposed to moist winds from the Arabian Sea, Hazara is the wettest part of Pakistan. At Abbottabad, annual rainfall averages around but has been as high as , whilst in parts of Mansehra District such as Balakot the mean annual rainfall is as high as . Due to its location on the boundary between the monsoonal summer rainfall regime of East Asia and the winter- dominant Mediterranean climate of West Asia, Hazara has an unusual bimodal rainfall regime, with one peak in February or March associated with frontal southwest cloud bands and another monsoonal peak in July and August. The driest months are October to December, though in the wettest parts even these months average around . Due to the high altitude, temperatures in Hazara are cooler than on the plains, though Abbottabad at still has maxima around 32 ¬∞C (90 ¬∞F) with high humidity in June and July. Further up, temperatures are cooler, often cooler than the Northern Areas valleys due to the cloudiness. In winter, temperatures are cold, with minima in January around 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F) and much lower in the high mountains. Snowfalls are not uncommon even at lower levels. Hazara lies close to the crossroads formed by the river Indus and the Grand Trunk Road. The Karakoram Highway begins at the town of Havelian and goes north through the division towards China via the Northern Areas. Demographics and society Major ethnic groups of the Hazara region are the Hindkowans (who speak various Hindko dialects), Pashtuns (speakers of Pashto) and Kohistanis (speakers of Indus Kohistani). Some districts of Hazara have received high scores in education in Alif Ailaan's 2017 rankings: Haripur District was ranked first in Pakistan, while Abbottabad and Mansehra were in the top three for the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Movement for Hazara Province A movement founded in 1987 by the late Malik Asif Advocate named \\"Hazara Qaumi Mahaz\\" (HQM) demands for separate Hazara Province. People of Saraiki areas in south Punjab also raised the voice for separate province by disgraced former Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani similar to Hazarawal peoples.MQM has nothing to do with target killings In April 2010, it was announced that through an amendment in the Constitution of Pakistan, the name of NWFP would be changed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leading to protests across the Hazara region under the leadership of late Baba Haider Zaman.Protest in Hazara continues over renaming of NWFP The announcement of the new name also led to calls from Hazara for a new separate province.Hazara MPs to table resolution in NA for separate province Ten persons died, and nearly two hundred were hurt during the rallies and protest all over Hazara region against NWFP and creation of new province Hazara in April, 2010 and a complete wheel-jam and shutter-down strike was again observed in the Hazara on 2 May 2010, in support of this demand. Large public meetings in this regard, as well as public protests, have been regularly organised by the HQM (Hazara Quami Mahaz Pakistan) and 'Tehreek I Hazara' movement, since; but the name of the NWF Province has been duly changed to 'Khyber Pakhtunkwha' and is a 'fait accompli'. The leadership of the Hazara movement, however, have vowed to continue their struggle until the achievement of their aims via peaceful and constitutional means. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on 21 March 2014 passed a resolution demanding the creation of the Hazara province.

Signs and symptoms alt= Morphea most often presents as macules or plaques a few centimeters in diameter, but also may occur as bands or in guttate lesions or nodules. Morphea is a thickening and hardening of the skin and subcutaneous tissues from excessive collagen deposition. Morphea includes specific conditions ranging from very small plaques only involving the skin to widespread disease causing functional and cosmetic deformities. Morphea discriminates from systemic sclerosis by its supposed lack of internal organ involvement. This classification scheme does not include the mixed form of morphea in which different morphologies of skin lesions are present in the same individual. Up to 15% of morphea patients may fall into this previously unrecognized category. Cause Physicians and scientists do not know what causes morphea. Case reports and observational studies suggest there is a higher frequency of family history of autoimmune diseases in patients with morphea. Tests for autoantibodies associated with morphea have shown results in higher frequencies of anti-histone and anti- topoisomerase IIa antibodies. Case reports of morphea co-existing with other systemic autoimmune diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis, vitiligo, and systemic lupus erythematosus lend support to morphea as an autoimmune disease. Borrelia burgdorferi infection may be relevant for the induction of a distinct autoimmune type of scleroderma; it may be called \\"Borrelia-associated early onset morphea\\" and is characterized by the combination of disease onset at younger age, infection with B. burgdorferi, and evident autoimmune phenomena as reflected by high-titer antinuclear antibodies. Diagnosis=Classification * Morphea‚Äìlichen sclerosus et atrophicus overlap is characterized by both lesions of morphea and lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, most commonly seen in women. * Generalized morphea is characterized by widespread indurated plaques and pigmentary changes, sometimes associated with muscle atrophy, but without visceral involvement. * Morphea profunda involves deep subcutaneous tissue, including fascia, and there is a clinical overlap with eosinophilic fasciitis, eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, and the Spanish toxic oil syndrome. Morphea profunda shows little response to corticosteroids and tends to run a more chronic debilitating course. * Pansclerotic morphea is manifested by sclerosis of the dermis, panniculus, fascia, muscle, and at times, the bone, all causing disabling limitation of motion of joints. * Linear scleroderma is a type of localised scleroderma which is an autoimmune disease characterized by a line of thickened skin which can affect the bones and muscles underneath it. It most often occurs in the arms, legs, or forehead, and may occur in more than one area. It is also most likely to be on just one side of the body. Linear scleroderma generally first appears in young children.James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. Page 171. . * Frontal linear scleroderma (also known as en coup de sabre or morphea en coup de sabre) is a type of linear scleroderma characterized by a linear band of atrophy and a furrow in the skin that occurs in the frontal or frontoparietal scalp. Multiple lesions of en coup de sabre may coexist in a single patient, with one report suggesting that the lesions followed Blaschko's lines. It gets its name from the perceived similarity to a sabre wound. alt=A young girl with facial palsy, complete ptosis, and marked atrophy of subcutaneous and bony structures on the left upper side of the face * Atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini (also known as \\"Dyschromic and atrophic variation of scleroderma,\\" \\"Morphea plana atrophica,\\" \\"Scl√©rodermie atrophique d'embl√©e\\") is a disease characterized by large lesions with a sharp peripheral border dropping into a depression with no outpouching, which, on biopsy, elastin is normal, while collagen may be thickened.Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). Page 1029. McGraw- Hill. . Atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini affects less than 200,000 Americans and is classified as a rare disease by http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov. The disease results in round or oval patches of hyper-pigmented skin. The darkened skin patches may sometimes have a bluish or purplish hue when they first appear and are often smooth to the touch and hairless. Treatment Throughout the years, many different treatments have been tried for morphea including topical, intra-lesional, and systemic corticosteroids. Antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine have been used. Other immunomodulators such as methotrexate, topical tacrolimus, and penicillamine have been tried. Children and teenagers with active morphea (linear scleroderma, generalised morphea and mixed morphea: linear and circumscribed) may experience greater improvement of disease activity or damage with oral methotrexate plus prednisone than with placebo plus prednisone. Some have tried prescription vitamin-D with success. Ultraviolet A (UVA) light, with or without psoralens have also been tried. UVA-1, a more specific wavelength of UVA light, is able to penetrate the deeper portions of the skin and thus, thought to soften the plaques in morphea by acting in two fashions: by causing a systemic immunosuppression from UV light, or by inducing enzymes that naturally degrade the collagen matrix in the skin as part of natural sun-aging of the skin. However there is limited evidence that UVA‚Äê1 (50 J/cm¬≤), low‚Äêdose UVA‚Äê1 (20 J/cm¬≤), and narrowband UVB differ from each other in effectivness in treating children and adults with active morphea. Epidemiology Morphea is a form of scleroderma that is more common in women than men, in a ratio 3:1. Morphea occurs in childhood as well as in adult life. Morphea is an uncommon condition that is thought to affect 2 to 4 in 100,000 people. Adequate studies on the incidence and prevalence have not been performed. Morphea also may be under-reported, as physicians may be unaware of this disorder, and smaller morphea plaques may be less often referred to a dermatologist or rheumatologist.

Statistics (per 2011) The attendance rate for students at the school is 95%, compared with a state average of 96%. 44% of the students at Berkner are economically disadvantaged, 17% enroll in special education, 4% enroll in gifted and talent programs, 24% are enrolled in career and technology programs, and 21% are considered \\"limited English proficient.\\" The ethnic makeup of the school is 23.58% Hispanic, 27.76% African American, 27.62% White, non-Hispanic, 16.01% Asian/Pacific Islander, and less than 1% Native American. The average class sizes at Berkner are 25 students for English, 21 for foreign language, 27 for math, 23 for science, and 24 for social studies. Teachers at the school carry, on average, 10 years of teaching experience and 7% of the teachers on staff are first-year teachers. Awards In 2007 the school won the Excellence in Education Award for the state of Texas. It was honored by the Texas Successful School Awards System in 2000 and 2001. Berkner was also named a National Blue Ribbon School in 1988‚Äì1989. Berkner is ranked #1017 the Top 1300 high schools in the U.S. by Newsweek magazine. Academics Berkner ranks its students based on a weighted GPA, in which Advanced Placement classes and Pre-AP classes add 10 and 5 points, respectively, to each students's final average in that class. In contrast to a decision by a selection committee, the valedictorian and salutatorian are the first and second highest averages of each graduating class, with the Top 10 receiving special gratitude at a reception dinner. Extracurricular activities Berkner's mascot is the Ram and the team shares Ram-Wildcat Stadium (capacity 11,000) with Lake Highlands High School. The athletics program has improved in recent years, as in 2005 BHS had the best football season in school history, finishing 12‚Äì1 after a loss to A&M; Consolidated High School in the quarterfinals of the Class 5A division. In the spring of 2006 the boys' basketball team made the state semifinals for the first time in school history. Berkner prides itself on its fine arts programs. The marching band has received 43 consecutive first Division ratings in University Interscholastic League marching contests. The Orchestra Program has won the TMEA Honor String Orchestra award in 1987 under Ruth Kurtis ‚Äì and most recently winning the same award in 2007 under Craig Needham. The theatre program provides one of the area's only technical theatre programs. The school's student newspaper is the Berkner Rampage. The inter-school radio and television station is KRAM-FM and KRAM-TV Channel 6. The \\"Mighty Ram Band\\" has approximately 360 students in its program. In the spring semester, the band splits into five bands; Symphonic Band I, Symphonic Band II, Symphonic Band III, Concert Band I, and Concert Band II. Other classes offered during the school day include a Music Theory Course, a Jazz Ensemble, a Percussion Ensemble, a Varsity and a Junior-Varsity Drum Line, and two sections of Color Guard / Winter Guard. The band was honored by the John Philip Sousa Foundation with the Sudler Flag of Honor in 1984 and 2004 to recognize its high standards of excellence in its concert activities over several years. The Berkner Band has been invited to perform at the Midwest International Band and Orchestra Clinic, and been named the Texas Music Educators Association (TMEA) Honor Band for the state of Texas in 1974, 1987, and 1991, 2nd place in 2011 and 2013 and 5th place in 2015. The Berkner Marching Band has advanced to the Texas UIL State Marching Contest every year since 1998, and has placed in the finals 7 out of 9 times advancing.

The school is also notable for hosting an annual battle of the bands held in the auditorium. It is one of the larger BOBs held in the area and features mostly rock and punk bands. There is the occasional appearance by rap and hip hop groups. Despite the requirement of having a band member be a Berkner High student to compete, bands from across the metroplex have performed. One notable guest band includes Bowling for Soup. The event is held typically in April or May. The event is sponsored by Peer Helpers and the Berkner Exchange Club. Since 2005, the 'house' band has been 'Old Skool', Berkner's own all- faculty cover band. Old Skool performs at the conclusion of the competition while the judges are tabulating the scores. The Berkner High School Academic Decathlon team has advanced to the Texas State Academic Decathlon competition every year since 2003‚Äì2004. The Berkner High School drill team, known as the Bandoleras, have performed with excellence over the past several decades. They have won major competitions at a national level, including the Starmakers series of drill team events. Their Spring Shows consistently sell out the BHS auditorium and are a regular draw on the Richardson arts scene. In 2012, the Bandoleras were given the opportunity to travel to Ireland to be in the St. Patrick's Day parade in Dublin. In addition to the Bandoleras, the hand-picked Comedy Troop draws many to the show because of its humorous skits. Berkner tennis team members won third place in district competition in 2007‚Äì2008. The team itself has consistently produced tennis players with Super-Champion rankings in the TTCA.

The station was then broadcasting on the frequency of 580 kHz, with the power of 10,000 watts. Despite the scarcity of new broadcasting facilities, the station has scored many milestones with its news, Congressional coverage, breaking news, exclusives, and blow-by-blow accounts of major national events. It was also a pioneer with trendsetting shows such as Camay Theater of the Air, Lovingly Yours, Helen, Kahapon Lamang, Tawag ng Tanghalan, Newscoop, and Kwentong Kutsero. Some of these shows eventually became television shows. DZBB was also the first to air live coverage of not only news and public affairs, but also entertainment and educational programmes. In 1957, DZBB moved to its new and current home at EDSA, Quezon City. Due to the success of DZBB, Stewart ventured into television on October 29, 1961 as DZBB-TV Channel 7 with the branding of RBS-7 (now known as GMA-7 Manila). The station was seized and closed in September 1972 due to Martial Law. Two years later, due to changes in media ownership laws, Channel 7, DZBB and their other sister provincial radio and television stations were eventually sold to the triumvirate of Gilberto Duavit, Sr., Menardo Jimenez and Felipe Gozon. At the same time, DZBB returned to the airwaves under the branding \\"Dobol B\\", which would later be rebranded to simply DZBB 594 kHz; and became a music-personality radio station. The station also covered important news coverages during the 70s and the 80s. In November 1978, DZBB moved to the present frequency of 594 kHz, in response to the adoption of the 9 kHz spacing on AM radio stations in the Philippines under the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975. 1989‚Äì1999: Bisig Bayan Arman Roque during his radio program in the early 1990s The station was rebranded as \\"Bisig Bayan\\" from July 17, 1989 to January 3, 1999; and completely changed its format to news and public service. Their new identity made the station more popular to radio listeners in Metro Manila. Rafael \\"Paeng\\" Yabut, Bobby Guanzon, Lito Villarosa, Rene Jose, Rey Pacheco, Raul Virtudazo, Jimmy Gil, Arman Roque, Rose \\"Manang Rose\\" Clores, German Moreno, Inday Badiday, Helen Vela, Augusto Victa, Manolo Favis, and Pol Caguiat were the personalities of the Bisig Bayan years. Also in the early 1990s, DZBB evolved into a 24-hour round-the-clock broadcasting service, in order to keep up with the pace of delivering news to its listeners, and came out with Kape at Balita, a morning news/commentary/talk show hosted by Bobby Guanzon and then GMA News reporter Jessica Soho in 1992, which expanded to television the same year. 1999‚Äìpresent: Super Radyo Super Radyo DZBB main logo used from 2002 until 2007. On January 4, 1999, the station was once again rebranded as \\"Super Radyo DZBB 594\\". Much of their programming focuses on news and current events, and it still simulcasts GMA programs such as 24 Oras and Saksi. In 2010, for the first time in Philippine radio history, DZBB and its rival station DZMM of ABS-CBN made history as they joined forces in the name of public service. Two children named James and Jesus asked for help to find their missing parents named Pascual and Norma Bantillan from Bohol on a rival program on DZMM Aksyon Ngayon Global Patrol and were eventually reunited through DZBB's program Aksyon Oro Mismo. In 2014, DZBB kept its winning streak in Mega Manila as it continued to lead rival stations in ratings, according to data from Nielsen Media Research. DZBB grabbed the lead in Mega Manila in June 2014 and has since sustained leadership in the area, which it repeated in 2017, 2019 and 2020.Super Radyo DZBB maintains lead in Mega Manila ratings In 2017, DZBB officially launched its new logo, its first ever jingle for the station and its newly renovated radio booth, as well as the relaunch of Dobol B sa News TV, after 5 years of hiatus on television. In 2020, DZBB temporarily suspends its regular programming, especially during overnight hours, in line with the enhanced community quarantine imposed by President Rodrigo Duterte, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which replaced them with news updates and hookup to sister station Barangay LS 97.1. Programming DZBB's programs are mostly news, current issues, and news analysis produced by the GMA News and Public Affairs department. Their morning radio shows were anchored mostly by news anchors and personalities from television. The station also has a newscast entitled Super Balita, as well as a simulcast of news and public affairs programs of GMA Network. On some occasions, DZBB would also air live and exclusive blow-by-blow boxing coverage, especially during Manny Pacquiao's fights (alongside Super Radyo stations nationwide). As such, DZBB became the first radio station to do so (until 2019). As of 2020, DZBB also live streams select programs on its official FB page.

AMODA was founded in 1997 by Harold Chaput, Samantha Krukowski and Chris Rankin in response to the abundance of digital art in the local scene and the absence of venues for such art. AMODA has not only presented local artwork, but has brought digital art and digital artists from around the globe to Austin. By putting local and global works and acts next to each other, AMODA has contributed to the already growing digital art and music scene in Austin, while gaining recognition around the world as an important museum that has shaped the definition of digital art. History The Austin Museum of Digital Art is the brainchild of Harold Chaput, then a Computer Sciences doctoral student at the University of Texas at Austin, and Christopher Rankin, an art history graduate of Trinity University and experienced museum worker. Rankin was dissatisfied with the state of the contemporary art scene in Austin. Chaput was connected to many artists and musicians employed in high tech positions who were looking for a creative outlet. By establishing an organization with the goals of supporting the production and exhibition of new work and encouraging discussion about the role of technology in current contemporary art, Chaput and Rankin hoped that they could encourage a community of artists, musicians, and technologists to create cutting-edge digital-based contemporary art. They joined up with Samantha Krukowski, an influential member of UT's communications department. The three of them swiftly settled on a subsection of contemporary art that used computers in some form, and coined the term Digital Art to describe it. They also agreed that the new organization should be a museum rather than a collective or a gallery, placing the emphasis on artistry and aesthetics rather than fashion and popularity. Thus the Austin Museum of Digital Art was founded in November 1997. Shortly after its founding, Rankin left AMODA because his new job working for the Texas Commission on the Arts posed a conflict of interest. Krukowski also left to become a Professor of Communications at UT. Rankin and Krukowski were replaced Kyle Anderson, Jennifer Potter, Joel Stearns and Robert Turknett. Together with Chaput, this board moved AMODA from a museum on paper to an art institution. They created AMODA's programs, including an educational program (2000), the Digital Showcase (2001), an exhibition series (2002), and a performance series (2003). Defining Digital Art AMODA defines Digital Art as art that uses digital technology in one of three ways: product, process or subject. Art that uses digital technology as the product can be considered digital art. This includes categories like \\"web art\\" or \\"demo art.\\" This is the most recognized definition of digital art. Art that uses digital technology in the process of creation can also be considered digital art. The drawings of Harold Cohen's AARON are digital art because a computer program was used to generate the works, even though the final product is ink on paper. Computer graphics on film, digital music, and the Cyberopera are all good examples of digital art as process. Finally, art that references digital art as its subject can also be considered digital art. A series of oil paintings showing a man connected to an online chat room could be categorized as digital art, even though digital technology was never used in the creation or display of the work. The central theme for all three approaches is: art that could not have been created without digital technology. All three address different facets of digital art, from presentation to technique to sociology, all of which are important to the history of art. Programming AMODA's programming was designed to be accessible without being condescending. It was unique in its ability to draw a younger audience than other museums and galleries could. AMODA's programs were integrated with the community and attracted a new population of art patrons through its non-traditional but high-quality presentation of digital art. AMODA's most popular and successful programs were its Exhibition Series and Digital Showcase. Digital Showcase The AMODA Digital Showcase is a monthly evening of digital art and music. Under the strict direction of Todd Simmons, a performance space is filled with digital art installations, and four to six digital music performances are shown throughout the evening. The intention of the Digital Showcase is to show digital art in situ. While an exhibition removes art from its natural environment and displays it for isolated examination, the Digital Showcase lets the different art installations and music performances bleed over each other. The result is an immersive art experience where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It is also wildly popular. Attendance is consistently in the hundreds, and the performances have been written up internationally.

Maria was the thirteenth named storm, sixth hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the record-breaking season. Maria formed in the central Atlantic on September 1 and tracked to the northwest, strengthening as it moved over warm waters. The storm reached its peak strength on September 5 east of Bermuda and gradually weakened before becoming extratropical on September 10. Maria did not affect any land as a tropical system, but it brought tropical storm-force winds to Iceland as an extratropical cyclone and produced heavy rain and three fatalities in Norway. Meteorological history A powerful tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 27. As it moved west into the Atlantic, it became more organized and the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles on September 1. Shear from an upper-level low to the southwest slowed the development of the storm and caused uncertainties in the National Hurricane Center's forecasts, as some models indicated that the depression would dissipate and others that it would become a hurricane. The depression gradually strengthened as it moved to the northwest across the open Atlantic Ocean, becoming Tropical Storm Maria on September 2 and reaching hurricane strength on September 4. In the central Atlantic, Hurricane Maria continued to strengthen in favorable conditions, and on September 5 briefly became a Category 3 hurricane with 115 mph (185 km/h) winds while 480 miles (770 km) east of Bermuda. Increasing shear and cooler waters caused the storm to rapidly weaken to a minimal hurricane on September 7. Operationally, the NHC believed that Maria had briefly weakened further into a tropical storm, but post-season analysis confirmed this did not occur. As Hurricane Maria moved to the northeast the official forecasts called for the storm to continue to weaken slowly but an interaction with an upper-level trough caused Maria to strengthen again. It was also predicted that the storm would rapidly become extratropical, but Maria retained tropical characteristics for 48 hours longer than some forecasts indicated. Maria weakened into a tropical storm on September 9 before finally becoming extratropical about midway between the Azores and Newfoundland early on September 10. The extratropical system intensified considerably, achieving hurricane intensity once again on September 11 at about 52¬∞N, with a minimum pressure of 962 mbar (hPa) ‚Äî equal to its minimum pressure as a tropical cyclone. It passed just to the south of Iceland on September 13 as a hurricane-strength extratropical system (although the center stayed offshore). As the storm approached Norway on September 14 it merged with another strong extratropical system. Impact and records Damage from a landslide in Bergen, Norway While Maria remained far from the U.S. East Coast, rip currents caused by the combined effects of the distant Maria and the closer Hurricane Nate (which was near Bermuda at the time) killed one person and seriously injured another in New Jersey. Maria never approached any land areas while a tropical system, but tracked toward northern Europe after becoming an extratropical storm on September 10. The first land effects were felt in Iceland on September 12, where tropical storm-force winds were reported. The strongest winds were recorded in Vestmannaeyjar where sustained winds in excess of 67 mph (107 km/h) were reported as well as a minimum pressure of 979 mbar. The storm then brushed the northernmost part of Scotland, with no reported damage there either. The extratropical Maria merged with another system and this storm made landfall in Norway. This storm brought tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall to that country, and caused flooding and several mudslides, particularly around Bergen, the most important of which occurred in Hatlestad. One person was killed immediately, at least nine others were injured, and numerous homes were destroyed. Marine interests were also affected, as a large number of ferries were docked in the Baltic Sea. On September 18, a woman died of injuries. Her daughter died on February 7, 2006, after having been kept alive in a respirator since the accident. After the storm, kr18.8 million (2005 NOK, $3.1 million in 2005 USD) in compensation was given for the damage. When Maria developed on September 2, it was the earliest ever in a season that the 13th named tropical storm developed, beating the previous record held by Hurricane Thirteen of the 1933 season by six days. This record has since been broken by Hurricane Marco in 2020.

The battle was the largest naval battle of the war, and one of the two battles (along with Battle of ≈öwiecino) which decided the final outcome of the war. Background The Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Ludwig von Erlichshausen, led the Teutonic fleet, in an attempt to come to the aid of the city of Mewe (\\"Gniew\\") via the Vistula River, which had been besieged by Polish forces since July, 1463. The Teutonic knights assembled 44 ships, mostly fishing boats, along with several galleys, staffed by 2500 men, of which around 1500 were armed. The battle The Prussian ships were led by privateers Vincent Stolle and Matthew Kolmener, of Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk); and Jacob Vochs of Elbing (now ElblƒÖg); with support from troops of the Polish king, Casimir IV Jagiellon. Initially the Danzig sailors, facing the incoming Teutonic flotilla alone, had only ten \\"szniks\\" (light sail boats common in the Baltic in the 15th century) which were staffed with five hundred men armed with crossbows and arquebuses. To delay the enemy, they sank a galley at a narrow part of the Vistula, which blocked the entrance from the lagoon to the river. Coming upon the obstacle, von Erlichshausen stalled long enough for the Elbing ships to join up with those of Danzig. Together, the two cities had around 30 ships of various types, 600 to 700 armed men, and a similar number of sailors manning the ships themselves. Von Erlichshausen ordered a withdrawal into the lagoon where his ships bunched up close to the shore. The cities' ships on the other hand, came out of the river into the lagoon and formed themselves into a crescent formation. Despite having fewer ships, the Prussians (as more experienced sailors) were victorious. They gained control of the Vistula. Among the captured knights was Hans Hetzel, the komtur of Memel (Klaipƒóda). Aftermath As a result of the battle, Mewe capitulated to Polish forces in 1464, and the Teutonic Navy was eliminated as a viable force. A number of mercenaries in the Order's service, including Bernard Szumborski, left the Teutonic side and signed an independent peace treaty with the Polish king, and the Poles and the Prussian Confederation seized the initiative in the Thirteen Years' War. The war itself ended with the signing of the Second Peace of Toru≈Ñ in 1466 and the incorporation of Royal Prussia, including Gda≈Ñsk and ElblƒÖg into Poland. In chronicles and literature The battle was first described by the contemporary Polish chronicler Jan D≈Çugosz.Note: D≈Çugosz, who was relying on two separate reports of the same battle (one from Gda≈Ñsk and the other from ElblƒÖg), erroneously reported that two separate battles had taken place. Subsequent research by historians, based on the contemporary account of Jan Lindau, corrected the mistake. The battle is described in several works of historical fiction, among them Znak Salamandry (\\"Sign of the Salamander\\") by Jerzy Piechowski, Skruszona Potƒôga (\\"A Crumbled Power\\") by Kazimierz Traciewicz and Ba≈Çtyckie Or≈Çy (\\"Eagles of the Baltic\\") by J√≥zef W√≥jcicki.

Biography=Early life Edward Lowassa is the fourth child of the herdsman Ngoyai Lowassa who worked part- time for the colonial government in the district of Monduli as a tarish (village law enforcement). Lowassa has a sister named Kalaine.\\"Lowassa, Mtoto wa tarishi anayetaka urais\\", Mwananchi.co.tz, 5 June 2015. Education Edward Lowassa joined Monduli Primary School (which was later renamed to Moringe Primary School) in 1961. Lowassa was the school band leader at Monduli Primary School and in 1967 he sat for the CPEE. He then went on to advance his education at Arusha Secondary School in 1968 and sat for his O-Level Certificate, the CSEE in 1971. For his A levels, he attended Milambo Secondary School from 1972 to 1973 where he sat for his ACSEE. Lowassa received his undergraduate degree in BA Fine and Performing Arts. University of Dar es Salaam in 1977. At the University of Dar es Salaam, he encountered Jakaya Kikwete and John Chilligati. In 1978 he was drafted into the army and fought in the Kagera War between Tanzania and Uganda. Lowassa then went on to earn a MSc. Development Studies from The University of Bath in the United Kingdom in 1984. Career Lowassa (right). Lowassa served as Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office during President Ali Hassan Mwinyi's second term. He sought the nomination of Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) as its presidential candidate in 1995 but was eliminated in the early stages by the former President Julius Nyerere, who strongly believed that Lowassa was not then correct material for the Presidency. He retained his parliamentary seat and became a strong backbencher in Parliament until 1997 when he was appointed Minister for State in the Vice President's Office for Environment and Poverty. Following the 2000 general elections, he was appointed Minister of Water and Livestock Development and made his mark as a hardworking minister. In 2005 Lowassa chose not to seek the CCM presidential nomination but became a key campaigner for his long-time friend, Jakaya Kikwete, in his bid for the presidential seat. Kikwete, running on a CCM ticket, won the elections by beating other contestants by a large margin. He received 82% of the votes. In return, President Kikwete nominated Lowassa as Prime Minister on 29 December 2005. Parliament overwhelmingly confirmed the nomination, with 312 votes in favour and two opposed, and Lowassa was sworn in on 30 December.Bilal Abdul- Aziz, \\"Lowassa new PM\\", Guardian (IPP Media), 30 December 2005. Lowassa has an extensive background in both parliamentary and government affairs. Richmond corruption scandal On February 7, 2008, Lowassa was forced to resign after being implicated in the Richmond Energy deal corruption scandal. This followed a parliamentary select committee report on an emergency power generation contract between the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Ltd (TANESCO), a public corporation, and a US company styled Richmond Development Company LLC of Houston, Texas. The five-member select committee, headed by Kyela MP, Dr. Harrison Mwakyembe, found the contract to have been fraudulently concluded, hence unconscionable. Richmond was contracted to provide 100 megawatts of electricity each day after a drought early in 2006 but the Richmond generators arrived late and did not work as expected. In spite of this, the government paid Richmond more than $100,000 a day. Lowassa's office then influenced the government's decision to extend Richmonds contract despite advice to the contrary from TANESCO. Two other cabinet ministers who had held the energy portfolio, Dr. Ibrahim Msabaha and Nazir Karamagi were forced to resign as well. Lowassa however denied that his office was involved in improperly awarding a contract to US-based electricity company Richmond Development in 2006. Barare Limited On 7 April 1997, Edward Ngoyayi Lowassa and his wife Regina Mumba Lowassa incorporated a company by the name of Barare Limited. They are both listed as shareholders, each with 500 shares. They were also both listed as directors of the company which was located on Maktaba Street, Dar es Salaam. In May 2009, Barare Limited was the subject of a money laundering investigation in the UK, after Lowassa's son, Frederick Edward Lowassa was suspected of money laundering.\\"lowassa sijui\\", xa.yimg.com, 21 May 2009. Presidential aspirations In 1995, Lowassa was among the more than 15 CCM aspirants for the presidency, but he was stopped in his tracks by retired president Julius Nyerere, who found him to have enriched himself too fast. Lowassa was eliminated by Nyerere's fiat and that contest within the party was eventually won by Benjamin Mkapa, who also won the election and became Tanzania's third president.Jenerali Ulimwengu, \\"As the race to succeed Kikwete hots up, Lowassa is the man to watch\\", The East African, 22 February 2014. In 2005, Lowassa strongly backed his friend Jakaya Kikwete and the two were dubbed \\"Boys Two Men\\" because of their strong political union that eventually enabled Kikwete to defeat all his rivals within the ruling party.\\"The big fear behind Lowassa's presidential aspirations\\", The Citizen , 22 March 2015. In 2014, Lowassa faced a one-year ban from CCM after he was accused of starting his campaign for presidency ahead of the authorized time. The ban expired in February 2015, only to be extended by the CCM Central Committee on the grounds that their final report was still not ready. In May 2015, Lowassa eventually launched his presidential campaign in Arusha. He stated that his top priorities would be overhauling the country's education sector, reducing poverty, boosting economic growth and fighting corruption.Reuters \\"Ex- Tanzanian PM Lowassa Launches Presidential Bid\\", Voice of America , 31 May 2015. On 11 July 2015, the CCM Central Committee eliminated Lowassa from its list of presidential aspirants. CCM shortlisted January Makamba, Bernard Membe, Asha-Rose Migiro, John Magufuli and Amina Salum Ali for the National Executive Committee (NEC) vote of 378 members. The elimination of Lowassa came as a shock to many who viewed him as an inevitable candidate.\\"CCM fallout looms as Lowassa left out of presidential race\\", The East African, 11 July 2015. Having failed to get the nomination, Lowassa denounced the CCM as \\"infested with leaders who are dictators, undemocratic and surrounded with greedy power mongers.\\" He left the party and instead joined Chadema, an opposition party. On 4 August 2015, he was designated as the presidential candidate of a coalition of four opposition parties, including Chadema.\\"Tanzanian opposition pick ex-prime minister for presidential race\\", AFP, 4 August 2015.

In more than fifty years with the company, she established a reputation as a versatile performer, a skilled rehearsal director, and a capable administrator.Zo√´ Anderson, The Royal Ballet: 75 Years (London: Faber & Faber, 2006).The Royal Ballet, The Royal Ballet Yearbook, 2010/11 (London: Oberon Books, 2011). Early life and training Monica Margaret Mason was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, into a family of British ancestry. She studied ballet from a young age with Ruth Inglestone, Reina Berman, and Frank Staff in her home city and, later, with Nesta Brooking in London. As an advanced student, she entered the Royal Ballet School in 1956, where she continued her education in both dance and academics.Barbara Newman, \\"Mason, Monica\\", in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 4, p. 306. Performing career Taken into the corps of the Royal Ballet in 1958, Mason was, at 16, the company's youngest member.John Gruen, \\"Monica Mason\\", in The Private World of Ballet (New York: Viking, 1975). She soon caught the eye of choreographer Kenneth MacMillan, who had been commissioned to create yet another dance version of The Rite of Spring, set to Igor Stravinsky's score that had caused such a ruckus at its premiere with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1913. Impressed by her talent and energy, and conscious, no doubt, of her youth and innocence, he cast her as the Chosen Maiden, around whom the rite evolves. She scored a marked success and thereafter became a particular favorite of MacMillan. Over the years, she danced in almost all his works in the Royal Ballet repertory, creating roles in six of them.Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, \\"Mason, Monica\\", in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000). Besides the Chosen Maiden, they are as follows. * 1974. Manon, music by Jules Massenet. Role: Lescaut's Mistress. * 1975. Elite Syncopations, music by Scott Joplin. Role: Calliope Rag. * 1975. The Four Seasons, music by Giuseppe Verdi. Role: Summer. * 1975. Rituals, music by B√©la Bart√≥k (Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion). Role: The Midwife.Rituals, kennethmacmillan.com * 1981. Isadora, music by Richard Rodney Bennett. Role: Nursey. Appointed a soloist in 1963, Mason was promoted to principal dancer in 1968. The range of roles in her personal repertory was broad, encompassing the classicism of Odette/Odile in Swan Lake and Nikiya in La Bayad√®re as well as the austerity of purely abstract works such as Song of the Earth, set by MacMillan to Gustav Mahler's meditative Das Lied von der Erde. She was dramatically effective in such disparate roles as the ruthless Black Queen in Checkmate by Ninette de Valois, and the gentle Lady Elgar in Enigma Variations (My Friends Pictured Within), by Frederick Ashton. Coldly implacable as Myrtha in Giselle and furiously malevolent as Carabosse in The Sleeping Beauty. She displayed warmth, charm, and grace in such evocative works as Liebeslieder Walzer by George Balanchine, and Dances at a Gathering by Jerome Robbins.Newman, \\"Mason, Monica\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance (1998), vol. 4, p. 307. Administrative career After many years on the stage of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, Mason began a new phase of her career as a ballet mistress and teacher.Alexander Bland, The Royal Ballet: The First Fifty Years (London: Threshold Books, 1981). She was appointed principal r√©p√©titeur (rehearsal director) for MacMillan's ballets in 1980, when she also began teaching classical variations to senior girls at the Royal Ballet School. She became the company's principal r√©p√©titeur in 1984, assistant to the director in 1988, and assistant director, to Anthony Dowell, in 1991. Capping her administrative career, she was named artistic director in 2002.Dalya Alberge, \\"Dancers' Joy over Choice of Royal Ballet Director\\", The Times (London), 19 December 2002. After ten years' service, during which she fostered many talents and greatly enriched the repertory, she retired in July 2012.Alastair Macaulay, \\"With Departure, a Ballet Director Comes into Focus\\", The New York Times, 12 November 2013. Peter Wright regarded her as the best artistic director since Ninette de Valois Honors and awards Mason has received numerous accolades, awards, and honours for her accomplishments during her long career. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2002 and elevated to the rank of Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 2008.

It runs in a northwest-southeasterly direction along the borders of Kern County and San Luis Obispo County. The name of the range is from Spanish temblor meaning \\"tremor\\", referring to earthquakes. The San Andreas Fault Zone runs parallel to the range at the base of its western slope, on the eastern side of the Carrizo Plain, while the Antelope Plain, location of the enormous Midway Sunset, South Belridge, and Cymric oil fields, lies to the northeast. Peaks within the Temblor Range average about 3500 ft (1,100 m) above sea level.\\"Temblor Range\\", Britannica.com The highest point is McKittrick Summit at 4,331 ft (1,320 m), located in the center of the range about 35 mi (56 km) west of Bakersfield.The Columbia Gazetteer of North America The summit on State Route 58, which crosses the range, is at above sea level. The lowest crossing of the range is at Polonio Pass at by State Route 46 at its northern end and is separated by the Diablo Range to the north near Cholame. Origin and composition The Temblor Range and surrounding region contains extensive outcrops of the Monterey Formation (Miocene age, about 20 to 9 million years). Rocks from the Monterey formation consist mostly of silicate shales and porcellanite (silica derived from fossil plankton in an intermediate to deep-water marine setting). Fossils and sediments from the Monterey Formation show that the Carrizo Plain region was a marine basin with shallow to intermediate depths (marine waters covered the southern San Joaquin Valley region). Marine sediments younger than about 9 million years are not preserved in the Carrizo Plain National Monument area, but they occur throughout the Kettleman Hills region (about north of the park). The Pliocene- age Etchegoin Formation contains marine fossils to about 4 million years old. Fossils of the Etchegoin Formation are supporting evidence that the Coast Ranges and the Temblor Range are young, having been uplifted mostly during the Pleistocene Epoch (or Quaternary Period) in the past several million years. Much of that ongoing uplift is due to tectonics associated with the San Andreas Fault and other fault systems in the region.United States Geological Survey During the Pleistocene, sometime more recently than 1.8 million years ago, an enormous block of the Temblor Range ‚Äì a swath of Monterey shale more than six miles (10 km) long, a mile across, and over thick, about three cubic miles of rock in all ‚Äì slid down the northeastern side of the range, covering a distance of approximately three miles and descending . This mass movement completely covered the McKittrick Oil Field, giving it a highly unusual geology for an oil field, as the petroleum deposits in most oil fields are in structural or stratigraphic traps; this field is capped by an enormous mass of rock that moved off of the adjacent mountain range.J.A.

Huxtable established architecture and urban design journalism in North America and raised the public‚Äôs awareness of the urban environment. In 1970 she was awarded the first ever Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. Architecture critic Paul Goldberger, also a Pulitzer Prize-winner (1984) for architectural criticism, said in 1996: \\"Before Ada Louise Huxtable, architecture was not a part of the public dialogue.\\" \\"She was a great lover of cities, a great preservationist and the central planet around which every other critic revolved,\\" said architect Robert A. M. Stern, dean of the Yale University School of Architecture. Penn Station, two years before demolition. \\"Not that Penn Station is the Parthenon,\\" Ada Louise Huxtable wrote, \\"but it might as well be because we can never again afford a nine-acre structure of superbly detailed travertine, any more than we could build one of solid gold. It is a monument to the lost art of magnificent construction, other values aside.\\" Early life Huxtable was born and died in New York City. She went to Hunter College in 1941 and after her graduation she studied architectural history at New York University 's Institute of Fine Arts. Her father, the physician Michael Landman, was co-author (with his brother, Rabbi Isaac Landman) of the play A Man of Honor. Ada Louise Landman received an A. B. (magna cum laude) from Hunter College, CUNY in 1941. In 1942, she married industrial designer L. Garth Huxtable, and continued graduate study at New York University from 1942 to 1950. From 1950 to 1951 she spent one year in Italy on a scholarship of the U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission. Career She served as Curatorial Assistant for Architecture and Design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York from 1946 to 1950. She received a Fulbright Scholarship, which enabled her to travel in Italy and research Italian architecture and engineering. Given this opportunity, she left MoMa. In 1958, she also received a Guggenheim Fellowship to research the structural and design advances of American architecture. She was a contributing editor to Progressive Architecture and Art in America from 1950 to 1963 before being named the first architecture critic at The New York Times, a post she held from 1963 to 1982. Her architectural writings were about the humanistic meaning and artistic power that also involved her displeasure for projects that were missing civic engagement. She made architecture a more prevalent part of the public dialogue by appearing on the front page of The New York Times. From 1968 to 1971, her public opinion was found so successful that it was commemorated in New Yorker cartoons. She received grants from the Graham Foundation for a number of projects, including the book Will They Ever Finish Bruckner Boulevard?. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974. Huxtable was the architecture critic for The Wall Street Journal, a position she held from 1997 until 2012. John Costonis, writing of how public aesthetics is shaped, used her as a prime example of an influential media critic, remarking that \\"the continuing barrage fired from [her] Sunday column... had New York developers, politicians, and bureaucrats, ducking for years.\\" He reproduces a cartoon in which construction workers, at the base of a building site with a foundation and a few girders lament that \\"Ada Louise Huxtable already doesn't like it!\\" Carter Wiseman wrote, \\"Huxtable's insistence on intellectual rigor and high design standards made her the conscience of the national architectural community.\\" She wrote over ten books on architecture, including a 2004 biography of Frank Lloyd Wright for the Penguin Lives series. She was credited as one of the main forces behind the founding of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1965. At the same time, she was a severe critic of addressing the city's past, writing in 1968: > \\"Nothing beats keeping the old city where it belongs and where its ghosts > are at home. [But] please, gentlemen, no horse-drawn cars, no costumes, no > wigs, no stage sets, no cute-old stores, no 're-creations' that never were, > no phony little-old-New York....

Ada Louise Huxtable's oral biography, by Lynn Gilbert, is included in Particular Passions: Talk With Women Who Shaped Our Times. Through the years, she became such an important figure for the architectural world that she was invited to be involved in numerous juries and committees. For example, she served as a juror for the Pritzker Architecture Prize and Preamium Imperiale of Japan. She was also a member on the Architectural Selection and Building Design Committees for the Getty Center, Getty Villa and more.

He held the chieftaincy title of the Lamofin of Ondo. Early life and Education Fawehinmi, popularly called Gani, was born on 22 April 1938, the son of Saheed and Munirat Fawehinmi of Ondo, in Ondo State.His father, Chief Saheed Tugbobo Fawehinmi, the Seriki Musulumi of Ondo, was a successful timber trader, philanthropist, civic activist and muslim chieftain of the Yoruba people. He was reported to be a follower of Ajao, who brought Islam to Ondo City ,South Western Nigeria. Chief Saheed Tugbobo Fawehinmi died on 5 February 1963 at the age of 89 years. Gani's grandfather was the late Chief Lisa Alujanu Fawehinmi of Ondo, who engaged in several successful battles for and on behalf of the Ondo people in the nineteenth century. Hence, the appellation the 'Alujanun', which means spirit. He died at the age of 92. Gani had his early education at Ansar-Ud-Deen Primary School, Iyemaja ‚Äì Ondo from 1947 to 1953 and his secondary school education at Victory College Ikare, a Christian School from 1954 to 1958, under the leadership of the Late Rev. Akinrele where he sat for and passed his West African School Certificate Examination in 1958. While in college, he was popularly known as \\"Nation\\" because of his passionate interest in national, legal and political affairs. He was an avid reader of Daily Times and West African Pilot, the most popular newspapers in Nigeria at that time. He then worked briefly as a law clerk in the High Court of Lagos until 1961. Gani enrolled at the Holborn College of Law- University of London to read law in 1961. While at University, his father died. He completed his academic degree in London with a measure of difficulty due to lack of funds. This involved doing various menial jobs in London, while in London, he was acquainted with books of revolutionary or radical figures such as Fidel Castro, Winston Churchill, David Ben-Gurion, Ghandhi, Mao Tse Tsung and Karl Marx. He returned to Nigeria in 1964 and was called to the bar the following year. He then worked briefly at the law firm of his brother, Saheed Fawehinmi before branching out on his own. Law career Fawehinmi gained prominence when he took on the case of a factory worker, Bala Abashe who alleged that the Secretary to the government of Benue-Plateau State, Andrew Obeya had an affair with his wife. Abashe then sued Obeya for assault and damages for adultery. Fawehinmi took on the case as a pro bono lawyer for Abashe while the state government stood behind their official. Efforts were made for Fawehinmi to drop the case, when that failed, Obeya was forced to resign. However, Fawehinmi was detained for nine months. The publicity of the case improved the exposure of his law practice. From 1971 to 1973, he was the national publicity secretary of the Nigerian Bar Association. However, in 1981, Fawehinmi was queried by a disciplinary committee and told to explain himself within fourteen days why he was touting himself through advertisements in a weekly publication contrary to the ethics of the bar.

Chief Gani Fawehinmi (1985) the Supreme Court upheld the Appeal Court judgement rendering the LPDC's proceedings against Chief Fawehinmi ineffective on the basis that the constitution of the LPDC with the Attorney-General as Chairman made him accuser, prosecutor and judge at the same time which breached the principles of natural justice and therefore Chief Fawehinmi's right to fair hearing. The judgement led to an amendment of the Legal Practitioners‚Äô Act 1975. Fawehinmi later ran afoul of an NBA directive. In 1984, when the new Buhari administration enacted the Recovery of Public Property decree, the NBA under the presidency of Bola Ajibola directed its members not to represent any of client in a military tribunal. Fawehinmi flouted the directive because he believed the accused should be made to disgorge any money stolen as a result his name was placed in NBA's dishonour roll. In 1994 he and some other notable Nigerians formed the National Conscience Party of Nigeria which exists till today and he stood for a presidential election in 2003 under the umbrella of the National Conscience Party. Gani Fawehinmi was elevated to the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), the highest legal title in Nigeria, in September 2001. Dele Giwa In 1986, while Chief Gani Fawehinmi was Dele Giwa's Lawyer, the latter was killed in a bomb blast under suspicious circumstances. As a result of his activities chief Gani Fawehinmi had been arrested, detained and charged to court several times. His international passport was seized on many occasions and his residence and Chambers were searched several times. He was beaten up time after time and was deported from one part of the country to another to prevent him from being able to effectively reach out to the masses among whom he was popular. His books were confiscated by the Federal Military Government and his library at Surulere, a suburb of Lagos, were set ablaze. His law Chambers at Anthony Village, Lagos State, were invaded by persons suspected to be agents of the government. The guards were shot, two of them seriously wounded. In the process of his crusades for the rule of law, the hopes and aspirations of the poor and the oppressed, he fought many battles against military dictatorship as a result of which he had been arrested several times by the military governments and their numerous security agents. He was dumped in many police cells and detained in several prisons between 1969 and 1996. His supporters have called him \\"the scourge of sphygmomanometer with which the blood pressure of dictators is gauged, the veritable conscience of the nation and the champion of the interests and causes of the masses\\". Many Nigerians also took to calling him the people's president.  Gani Fawehinmi Library  Gani Fawehinmi library was established in 1965 at no.116, Denton street,Ebute Meta, Lagos when the founder established his chamber. the Library was moved to No. 28 Sabiu Ajose Crescent, Surulere, Lagos. In 1978, the Library moved from Surulere to No. 35 Adeniran Ajao Road, Ajao Estate, Anthony Village, Lagos and between 2009 and 2012,the Library moved to its present and permanent site at Gani Fawehinmi Library and Gallery at Otunba Jobi-Fele Way Central Business District (CBD),Alausa, Ikeja.

The library has over 400 bibliographic materials on the fouder and also contain gallery of chief Gani Fawehinmi.  Awards Received  On 11 June 1993 Fawehinmi was awarded the biennial Bruno Kreisky Prize. This prize, named in honour of Bruno Kreisky, is awarded to international figures who advance human rights causes.In 1998, he received the International Bar Association's 'Bernard Simmons Award' in recognition of his human-rights and pro-democracy work. In 2018, Chief Fawehinmi was posthumously awarded the GCON, Nigeria's second highest honour. Death Gani, as he was fondly called, died in the early hours of 5 September 2009 after a prolonged battle with lung cancer. He was 71 years old. Later he was buried on 15 September 2009 in his home town of Ondo City Nigeria. Gani Fawehinmi died as a disappointed man, because of the state of his country at the time of his death, he refused the highest honour accorded him by his country on his death bed. Rejection of National Award In 2008 Chief Gani Fawehinmi rejected one of the highest national honours that can be bestowed on a citizen by the Nigerian government ‚Äì Order of the Federal Republic (OFR) ‚Äì in protest of the many years of misrule since Nigeria's independence.

S. youngi lived during the Early Cretaceous (Aptian/Albian stage, around 113 million years ago).Sereno, P.C. (2010). \\"Taxonomy, cranial morphology, and relationships of parrot-beaked dinosaurs (Ceratopsia: Psittacosaurus).\\" New Perspectives on Horned Dinosaurs. Bloomington: Indiana, 21-58. It measured approximately one meter long (3.3 ft). It lived in Inner Mongolia, China, and probably ate invertebrates and other small prey. They live in what is now Mongolia, which was part of Laurasia. Discovery Skeletal restoration In 1988, a Chinese- Canadian expedition discovered the remains of a small theropod near Huamuxiao, in the Ordos Basin of Inner Mongolia. Sinornithoides youngi, the type species, was named and described in 1993/1994 by Dale Russell and Dong Zhiming based on this fossil specimen from the Lower Cretaceous Ejinhoro Formation. The generic name is derived from Latin Sinae, \\"Chinese\\", and Greek ·ΩÑœÅŒΩŒπœÇ, ornis, \\"bird\\", en ~ŒµŒπŒ¥ŒÆœÇ, ~eides, a suffix meaning \\"~like\\", in reference to the bird-like build.

The holotype is preserved in much the same roosting position as another troodontid fossil, that of Mei long, with its snout tucked under its left hand. It represents a subadult individual.Currie, P. and Dong, Z. (2001). \\"New information on Cretaceous troodontids from the People's Republic of China.\\" Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 38: 1753‚Äì1766. Description Size of Sinornithoides, compared to a human Sinornithoides is a troodontid, a group of small, bird-like, gracile maniraptorans. All troodontids have many unique features of the skull, such as closely spaced teeth in the lower jaw, and large numbers of teeth. Troodontids have sickle- claws and raptorial hands, and some of the highest non-avian encephalization quotients, meaning they were behaviourally advanced and had keen senses. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated its body length at 1.1 metres, its weight at 2.5 kilogrammes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 139 Restoration of a nesting individual In 1994, Sinornithoides was one of the most completely known troodontids, especially as regarded the palate, but the lack of sufficient fossil material to compare it with induced Russell and Dong not to indicate any diagnostic traits. The skull of Sinornithoides is elongated and pointed. However, the head is relatively short compared to the body as a whole. The praemaxilla is short. There is a fenestra promaxillaris, a small opening in the front of the maxilla side, which is rare among troodontids. There are four premaxillary and about twenty- three maxillary teeth. The maxillary teeth have no serrations on their front edge; the denticles on the concavely curved rear edge are small. The maxillary teeth are rather recurved. The lacrimal bone lacks a pneumatic channel. In the braincase the subotic recess is large. The tips of the lower jaws do not curve towards each other but touch at their inner sides. The external mandibular fenestra is large. The dentary, lower jaw, teeth are quite pointed and have no front edge denticles; their rear edge is very straight. The holotype preserves a furcula and a basket of fifteen pairs of gastralia. The arms are weakly developed, with a slender humerus and ulna. The front top of the third metatarsal is not fully overgrown by the second and fourth metatarsals. The sickle claw of the second toe is relatively large and long for a troodontid. Classification Sinornithoides was in 1994 assigned to the Troodontidae. A possible position of Sinornithoides in the evolutionary tree of the Paraves is shown by the cladogram below, following a 2012 analysis by Turner, Makovicky and Norell.

Its population in 2011 was 45,547. History Originally there was only one large rural municipality (R.M.) known as Kildonan. In 1914, it was divided into the Rural Municipality of West Kildonan and the Rural Municipality of East Kildonan. A petition to the provincial government led to a further division of East Kildonan. On January 1, 1925, the northern portion became incorporated as the Rural Municipality of North Kildonan. North Kildonan was a farming community and in 1928, the first Mennonites settled there. This was done to fulfil immigration requirements to be farmers and yet be close to city employment opportunities. Present day In 1972, North Kildonan and other municipalities were amalgamated with the city of Winnipeg to create the modern city of Winnipeg. North Kildonan is a ward within Winnipeg represented by a member of Winnipeg City Council. Its approximate boundary-lines are as follows: *Glenway Ave. (from Raleigh St. to Henderson Hwy.), *The Red River (from Glenway Ave. to McLeod Ave.), *McLeod Ave. (from Henderson Hwy. to Gateway Road), *Gateway Road (from Oakland Ave. to 100 metres north of Blantyre Ave.), *Line North of Blantyre Ave. (from Gateway Road to Panet Road), *Panet Road (from line north of Blantyre Ave. to 250 metres south of Almey Ave.), *Line south of Almey Ave. (from Panet Road to Owen St.), *Owen St. to Ravelston Ave. West, *Ravelston Ave. west to Plessis Road, *Plessis Road to Springfield Road, *Springfield Road to the line comprising the north boundary of the City of Winnipeg 100 metres west of Wenzel St., *and finally a straight line that runs northwest from that location back to the intersection of Raleigh St. and Glenway Ave. (this line runs parallel to, and just north of, Knowles Ave.) Representation=Member of Legislature Assembly The current MLA is Andrew Micklefield in the south end and Cathy Cox in the north part.

Menahem Golan has served as CEO of the company from 1989 to the company's bankruptcy. History It was formed sometime in 1971 as a production company and distributor as 21st Century Distribution Corporation. In the late 1980s, while filing for bankruptcy, it was purchased by Giancarlo Parretti. Path√© had also recently purchased The Cannon Group, which was renamed Path√© Communications, and he eventually handed 21st Century Film Corporation and Spider-Man and Captain America film rights (held by Cannon) over to Israeli filmmaker Menahem Golan as part of Golan's severance package from Cannon. Golan's goal was to release high-quality motion pictures to the American and worldwide film audiences, but 21st Century only enjoyed small-scale success releasing low- budget films like Bullseye!, art-house films like Eraserhead, as well as remakes of The Phantom of the Opera and Night of the Living Dead. In April 1989, Twenty-first Century Film and Path√© Communications ended their film production contract. As part of the termination, 21st Century Film received rights to two feature-length movies: the completed Mack the Knife, in production Phantom of the Opera plus other projects and scripts rights. While Path√© would no longer have any financial obligations to 21st Century. Captain America was filmed and was given only a limited theatrical release worldwide. Looking for funding for the Spider-Man film was difficult; 21st Century sold the film's TV rights to Viacom, the home-video rights to Columbia and theatrical rights to Carolco. In 1993, Golan triggered a series of lawsuits for 21st Century over Spider-Man as he feared being pushed out. Bankruptcy followed within the year for the company. In 1995, the judge ruled that the Spider-Man film rights expired and reverted to Marvel. Meanwhile, all of 21st Century's film library and assets were acquired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (which had merged with Path√©/Cannon earlier and was a theatrical distributor of Carolco's films at the time), mostly due to a quitclaim deed by Carolco. In 1993, it released a few more movies including Deadly Heroes and most notably Death Wish V: The Face of Death, the last in the series and Charles Bronson's final theatrical film. Currently, the majority of 21st Century Film Corporation's film catalog is owned by MGM Studios, with the exception of Night of the Living Dead and The Forbidden Dance, both of which were distributed by Columbia Pictures and are currently owned by parent company Sony Pictures.

Geoffrey Chew and others went so far as to question the distinction between composite and elementary particles, advocating a \\"nuclear democracy\\" in which the idea that some particles were more elementary than others was discarded. Instead, they sought to derive as much information as possible about the strong interaction from plausible assumptions about the S-matrix, which describes what happens when particles of any sort collide, an approach advocated by Werner Heisenberg two decades earlier. The reason the program had any hope of success was because of crossing, the principle that the forces between particles are determined by particle exchange. Once the spectrum of particles is known, the force law is known, and this means that the spectrum is constrained to bound states which form through the action of these forces. The simplest way to solve the consistency condition is to postulate a few elementary particles of spin less than or equal to one, and construct the scattering perturbatively through field theory, but this method does not allow for composite particles of spin greater than 1 and without the then undiscovered phenomenon of confinement, it is naively inconsistent with the observed Regge behavior of hadrons. Chew and followers believed that it would be possible to use crossing symmetry and Regge behavior to formulate a consistent S-matrix for infinitely many particle types. The Regge hypothesis would determine the spectrum, crossing and analyticity would determine the scattering amplitude (the forces), while unitarity would determine the self-consistent quantum corrections in a way analogous to including loops. The only fully successful implementation of the program required another assumption to organize the mathematics of unitarity (the narrow resonance approximation). This meant that all the hadrons were stable particles in the first approximation, so that scattering and decays could be thought of as a perturbation. This allowed a bootstrap model with infinitely many particle types to be constructed like a field theory ‚Äî the lowest order scattering amplitude should show Regge behavior and unitarity would determine the loop corrections order by order. This is how Gabriele Veneziano and many others, constructed string theory, which remains the only theory constructed from general consistency conditions and mild assumptions on the spectrum. Many in the bootstrap community believed that field theory, which was plagued by problems of definition, was fundamentally inconsistent at high energies. Some believed that there is only one consistent theory which requires infinitely many particle species and whose form can be found by consistency alone. This is nowadays known not to be true, since there are many theories which are nonperturbatively consistent, each with their own S-matrix. Without the narrow-resonance approximation, the bootstrap program did not have a clear expansion parameter, and the consistency equations were often complicated and unwieldy, so that the method had limited success. It fell out of favor with the rise of quantum chromodynamics, which described mesons and baryons in terms of elementary particles called quarks and gluons. \\"Bootstrapping\\" here refers to 'pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps,' as particles were surmised to be held together by forces consisting of exchanges of the particles themselves.

Located north of Malakand near the confluence of the Swat River with the Panjkora River, in a commanding position near the entrance to Swat District and at the entrance to Lower Dir. It is about from Peshawar and away from Mingora.  History  An early stupa, 6 meters in diameter, with fallen umbrella on side. Chakpat, near Chakdara. Probably Maurya empire, 3rd century BCE. Chakdara has been an important center for the last 3500 years and is littered with remains of the Gandhara grave culture, Buddhist sites, and Hindu Shahi forts. The ancient route from Afghanistan via Nawa Pass and Katkala Pass/Zwalm pul (Bridge) Swat River crosses at Chakdara. The Mughals built a fort here in 1586, occupied in 1895 by the British, who built the present fort in 1896 and were forced to defend it during the Siege of Malakand in 1897. Archaeological sites Buddhist sculpture of the 1st to 7th centuries from nearby sites and Hindu Shahi artefacts are now displayed at Chakdara Museum. Damkot Hill The most important site in Chakdara is Damkot Hill. The top of Damkot Hill has been excavated and houses with pottery and jewellery have been discovered. These items are now displayed in the Saidu Sharif Museum. At the foot of Damkot Hill at Salami there is an early graveyard. Early settlers buried partially cremated bodies surrounded by everyday utensils. The graves were sealed by large stone slabs. A Buddhist stupa and monastery of the first century AD were excavated by Ahmad Hasan Dani in 1962-65. There are some Buddhist carvings at the foot of the hill. During the Hindu Shahi period a fort was built here which was destroyed in the 11th century. In the 19th century the British occupied this hill. Behind Damkot Hill at Chat pat is the site of a monastery of the late 4th century. The sculpture from this monastery is displayed in Chakdara Museum. Andaan Dheri Andaan Dheri, an important Buddhist site, is located 7 km north of Chakdara Bridge opposite to Gul Abad Degree College for Boys near the village of Uchh. According to the Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang this site was connected with a legend about Buddha. According to the legend, Buddha changed himself into a great serpent lying dead in the valley in order to save the people from famine. The starving people cut pieces from the body and fed themselves. According to another tradition, Gandhara is also thought to be the location of the mystical Lake Dhanakosha, birthplace of Padmasambhava, founder of Tibetan Buddhism. The Kagyu sect of Tibetan Buddhism identifies the lake with the Andaan Dheri stupa. A spring was said to flow from the base of the stupa to form the lake. Archaeologists have found the stupa but no spring or lake can be identified. Andaan Dheri Stupa was excavated by Dani. Over 500 pieces of Gandhara sculpture were recovered. Other sites from Andannd Dherai Stupa, there is the Hindu Shahi fort of Kamal Khan Chena (spring, ), which is now in ruins. From this fort a track leads to Nimogram Buddhist Monastery and Stupa. It has three main stupas, which identify three principles of Buddhism; Buddha the teacher, Dharma, Sangha (the Buddhist order). Near Chakdara Bridge there are ruins of the Hindu Shahi Period and stupas at Haibatgram, Top Dara and Landakai.

In 1938 he was joined by paleontologist Yang Zhongjian, at the time better known as \\"C.C. Young\\" in the West. In 1941, Yang named remains of a \\"prosauropod\\" Lufengosaurus huenei. The generic name refers to Lufeng. The specific name honours Yang's old tutor, the German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene.Young, C.-C. 1940. \\"Preliminary notes on the Lufeng vertebrate fossils\\".

In 1940 Yang named another prosauropod: Gyposaurus sinensis. In 1976 Peter Galton considered this species to be identical to Lufengosaurus. As it is found in Bajocian stage deposits of China, this would make Lufengosaurus one of the few \\"prosauropod\\" genera to survive into the Middle Jurassic. However, the identity is today generally doubted.Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., Osm√≥lska, H. (eds.) (2004). The Dinosauria, Second Edition.

Occasional Papers Of The National Museums and Monuments of Rhodesia Series B Natural Sciences 6(10): 689-840 However, a reanalysis in 2005 by Paul Barrett and colleagues of the skull of Lufengosaurus huenei establishes it as a distinct genus separate from either Massospondylus or Yunnanosaurus.Barrett PM, Upchurch P, Xiao-lin W.

Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 25(4): 806-822 Skull Lufengosaurus magnus skull, Beijing Museum of Natural History Lufengosaurus snout was deep and broad, and it had distinctive bony bumps just behind its large nostrils and on its cheeks. A bony ridge on the side of its upper jaw might have helped anchor soft tissue. If so, then Lufengosaurus must have had larger cheeks than most other sauropodomorphs. Its closely spaced, serrated teeth suited a diet of leaves. Classification Yang assigned Lufengosaurus to the Plateosauridae and this is still a common classification in China. Some cladistic analyses have found Lufengosaurus as a member of the Massospondylidae. Lufengosaurus was often thought to be very similar to Plateosaurus from Europe. However, new work has proven that the pair are quite different, and Lufengosaurus was closer to Coloradisaurus and Massospondylus. Palaeobiology Lufengosaurus huenei pelvis. Like all early sauropodomorphs, Lufengosaurus had much longer hindlimbs than forelimbs and was probably bipedal. It was herbivorous, although it had sharp claws (with an especially large thumb claw) and teeth. These features have been used to support claims, the most recent by Cooper in 1981, that Lufengosaurus may have been at least partially omnivorous, but the sharp teeth witnessed in Lufengosaurus and other early sauropodomorphs are similar to those seen in iguanaian lizards ‚Äì which are herbivorous.Barrett, P.M. (2000). Chapter 3: Prosauropod dinosaurs and iguanas: speculations on the diets of extinct reptiles. IN: Evolution of Herbivory in Terrestrial Vertebrates Alternatively, the claws may have been used for defense or raking foliage from trees.

Portrait of Fath Ali Shah Qajar, 1815. Brooklyn Museum Contemporary painting Fath Ali Shah in Qajar style by Armin Mehrabi. Qajar dynasty reliefs in Tangeh Savashi, of the Fath Ali Shah era. Qajar art (Persian: ŸáŸÜÿ± ÿØŸàÿ±Ÿá ŸÇÿßÿ¨ÿßÿ±€åŸá) refers to the art, architecture, and art-forms of the Qajar dynasty of the late Persian Empire, which lasted from 1781 to 1925 in Iran (Persia). The boom in artistic expression that occurred during the Qajar era was the fortunate side effect of the period of relative peace that accompanied the rule of Agha Muhammad Khan and his descendants. With his ascension, the bloody turmoil that had been the 18th century in Persia came to a close, and made it possible for the peacetime arts to again flourish. Qajar painting Most notably, Qajar art is recognizable for its distinctive style of portraiture. Origins and influences The roots of traditional Qajar painting can be found in the style of painting that arose during the preceding Safavid empire. During this time, there was a great deal of European influence on Persian culture, especially in the arts of the royalty and noble classes. European art was undergoing a period of realism and this can be seen in the depiction of objects especially by Qajar artists. The European influence is very well evidenced in the pre√´minent position and prestige of oil painting. While oil paintings had been par for the course during previous periods of Persian art, it was the influence of the European masters, like Rubens and Rembrandt, the true masters of oil portraiture, that raised it to the highest level. Heavy application of paint and dark, rich, saturated colors are elements of Qajar painting that owe their influences directly to the European style. Development of painting style While the depiction of inanimate objects and still lifes is seen to be very realistic in Qajar painting, the depiction of human beings is decidedly idealised. This is especially evident in the portrayal of Qajar royalty, where the subjects of the paintings are very formulaically placed and situated to achieve a desired effect. =Royal portraiture= Most famous of the Qajar artworks are the portraits that were made of the various Persian Shahs. Each ruler, and many of their sons and other relatives, commissioned official portraits of themselves either for private use or public display. The most famous of these are of course the myriad portraits which were painted of Fath Ali Shah Qajar, who, with his narrow waist, long black bifurcated beard and deepest eyes, has come to exemplify the Romantic image of the great Oriental Ruler. Many of these paintings were by the artist Mihr 'Ali. While the portraits were executed at various points throughout the life of the Shah, they adhere to a canon in which the distinctive features of the ruler are emphasized. Portraits exist of Fath Ali Shah in a very wide assortment of situations, from the armor-clad warrior king to the flower smelling gentleman, but all are similar in their depiction of the Shah, differing only slightly, usually due to the specific artist of the portrait. It is only appropriate that this particular Shah be so immortalized in this style, as it was under his rule as the second Qajar shah that the style truly flourished. One reason for this were the stronger and stronger diplomatic ties that the Qajar rulers were nurturing with European powers. As the Shangri La Center for Islamic Arts and Culture notes, \\"Later Iranian art of the Afsharid (1736‚Äì96), Zand (1750‚Äì94) and Qajar (1779‚Äì1924) periods is distinguished by the depiction of life-size figures, whether in stone relief, tilework or painting on canvas. In the latter category, Qajar rulers like Fath ‚ÄòAli Shah (r. 1797‚Äì1834) perpetuated a widespread interest in large-scale portraiture (even sending portraits to political rivals).\\" While Fath Ali Shah himself never visited Europe, many portraits of him were sent with envoys in the effort to convey the imperial majesty of the Persian court. With the rise of Naseraddin Shah photography became much more important in the art of the period, and portraiture, while still used for official purposes, fell gradually out of favor. In addition, as Nassirudin Shah was the first Persian ruler to visit Europe, the official sending of portraits was left by the wayside, a relic of times gone by. =Other portraiture= Khusraw Discovers Shirin Bathing, From Pictorial Cycle of Eight Poetic Subjects, mid 18th century. Brooklyn Museum. The depiction of nonroyal persons also has a very important place in the explanation and understanding of Qajar art. While naturally not commoners, the subjects of these portraits were often minor princes (of which there were many!), the grandsons, nephews, and great-nephews of the ruling or previously ruling Shahs. These princes, with the wealth and position of their families, had very little else to do but contribute to the arts, so their patronage was certainly less than detrimental to the arts of the time. Often, portraits of this class would be commissioned as depictions of family groups, depicting the male, an idealized, nubile wife, and their perfectly formed child. Other times, they would be in the form of a royal portrait, depicting solely the male commissioner, but with subtle variations making it clear that the sitter is not a Royal. One way that this was accomplished was through a cartouche that was displayed next to the head of each portrait's subject, clarifying who was being depicted, and any relevant titles (such as SoltƒÅn, shƒÅhzƒÅdeh, &c.;). For the ruling head of Persia, this cartouche is fairly regulated, (\\"al-soltƒÅn Official name ShƒÅh QƒÅjƒÅr\\"), while for anyone else, it may include a longer name, a lesser title or a short genealogy. Depiction of women One of the most unusual practices in Qajar art is the depiction of women. In such a strongly Islamic society, it seems to contradict that view that the women of Qajar Persia are depicted in much art as wearing very little in the way of modest clothing. This is strikingly at odds with the prevalent use of the chƒÅdor (, lit. \\"tent\\") in Persia. Calligraphy in the Qajar era Calligraphy is and has been the definitive Persian art form. There exists a prohibition in Islam against the depiction of human beings, similar to the Jewish rule against graven images, and as such, calligraphy and its associated art forms became a very important part of Islamic expression. Upon the introduction of the Arabic script to Persia, the people therein set themselves to making it their own. The ShƒÅhanshƒÅhnƒÅmeh During the reign of Fath Ali Shah Qajar, a work of literature and art was commissioned that was intended to rival the work of Ferdowsi. This book was called the ShƒÅhanshƒÅhnƒÅmeh (, lit. \\"Book of the King of Kings\\"). It is apparent to the scholar of Persian art and literature that this book is based upon the work of art known as the ShƒÅhnƒÅmeh (, lit. \\"Book of Kings\\") which was written by Ferdowsi in the year 1000 . The Shahnameh, in brief, chronicles the quasi-mythical founding of the Persian Empire and the heroes and villains who punctuated its inception. This Sahanshahnameh is now situated in the National Library of Vienna, Austria. Qajar textile arts The sartorial inclinations of the Qajar period were not so very different from those of earlier period until the latter half of the era. As is evidenced by the early portraiture of Fath Ali Shah Qajar and Mohammad Shah Qajar, the traditional styles of dress in Persia were preserved, but as Western influences became more and more prevalent, the royal portraits began to depict the Shah in a more Western, military style garb (such as the portrait of Nassirudin Shah Qajar above). This is not to say, however, that the traditional textile arts of Persia had fallen into disuse. While the Shah wished to appear advanced and western to European monarchs and diplomats, it was still his duty to exude the pride and ancient glory of the Persian Empire, so court dress retained very strong elements of traditional dress.

Photography became popular in Iran during the late Qajar period and was embraced enthusiastically by Nasir al-Din Shah, who famously photographed many of the women of the Qajar palace. During the period of his rule, the interaction between photography and painting grew, both in terms of style and composition.http://www.mia.org.qa/en/qajar-women/qajar- photography Prince Malek Qasem Mirza's daguerreotype self-portrait.

It was a large quadrupedal herbivore. Unlike most other sauropods, Euhelopus had longer forelegs than hind legs. This discovery was paleontologically significant because it represented the first dinosaur scientifically investigated from China: seen in 1913, rediscovered in 1922, and excavated in 1923.H. C.

Description Size comparison Size Euhelopus has since its original description often been considered a rather large sauropod. It has been thought to weigh about fifteen to twenty tonnes and attain an adult length of . Later estimates have downsized this considerably. In 2016, Gregory S. Paul estimated the body length at eleven metres, the weight at 3.5 tonnes.Paul, G.S., 2016, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs. Second Edition, Princeton University Press p. 224 Distinguishing anatomical features The original diagnosis by Wiman is outdated. A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some of the features in a diagnosis may be autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to an organism or group. Restoration According to a study by Jeffrey A. Wilson and Paul Upchurch in 2009, Euhelopus can be distinguished based on, among others, these autapomorphies: * The teeth are inclined to the front as proven by the edge of the enamel at the front of the tooth running more in the direction of the top and a front buttress also located more closely to the top. * The axis, the second neck vertebra, has a hollow at the rear of its neural spine, with three deeper pneumatic depressions in it. * The postaxial cervical vertebrae, the neck vertebrae behind the axis, have variably developed epipophyses and more subtle \\"pre‚Äêepipopophyses\\" below the prezygapophyses, projections on the front of the ridge between the prezygapophysis and the vertebral body. * The cervical neural arches have an epipophyseal‚Äêprezygapophyseal lamina, an horizontal ridge running from the epipophysis to the prezygapophysis, separating two pneumatocoels by dividing the usual depression at the side base of the neural spine. * In the neck vertebrae the pleurocoels are reduced to foramina, smaller openings. * In the neck vertebrae the neural spines are reduced in height and length. * The third neck vertebra has a neural spine with a transversely flattened forwardly directed process. * The anterior cervical vertebrae have three costal spurs between the tuberculum and capitulum, the heads of their ribs. * The neck rib shafts are strongly positioned below the vertebral body due to an appending parapophysis and a long section between the two rib heads. * The middle presacral neural spines, of the rear neck and front back, are divided or forked, and in the neck base and anterior dorsal vertebrae bear a median tubercle that is at least as large as the metapophyses, the prongs of the fork, resulting in a \\"trifid\\" condition. * The middle and posterior dorsal parapophyseal and diapophyseal laminae are arranged in a \\"K\\" configuration. * The presacral pneumaticity extends into the ilium, which thus is permeated by air chambers. Discovery and naming Cast of the holotype skull on display in Japan The original discovery was by a Catholic priest, Father R. Mertens, in 1913. He showed some remains he had excavated to the German mining engineer Gustav Behaghel who in 1916 sent three vertebrae to the head of the Geological Survey of China Ding Wenjiang (\\"V.K. Ting\\"). This was probably the first occasion dinosaur bones from China were scientifically studied. With help of another Catholic priest, Father Alfred Kaschel, the site was rediscovered in November 1922 by Johan Gunnar Andersson and Tan Xichou. In March 1923, the Austrian student Otto Zdansky excavated two skeletons at sites about three kilometres apart. It was originally described and named Helopus, meaning \\"Marsh Foot\\", by the Swedish paleontologist Carl Wiman in 1929, after the Greek ·ºïŒªŒøœÇ, helos, \\"swamp\\", and œÄŒøœçœÇ, pous, \\"foot\\".C. Wiman. 1929. \\"Die Kreide-Dinosaurier aus Shantung\\" [The Cretaceous dinosaurs from Shantung]. Palaeontologia Sinica, Series C 6(1): 1-67 The name refers to the marshy area of the finds and to truga, Swedish swamp shoes, which according to Wiman resembled the wide feet of the animal. This name however, already belonged to a bird because the Caspian tern had once been named Helopus caspius Wagler 1832. The sauropod dinosaur was therefore renamed Euhelopus (True marsh-foot) in 1956 by Alfred Sherwood Romer.A.S. Romer. 1956. Osteology of the Reptiles, University of Chicago Press 772 pp There proved to be a plant genus (a grass) with the same generic name, Euhelopus. However, a genus in one biological kingdom may have a name that is used as a genus name in another kingdom, so Euhelopus was allowed. The type species is Helopus zdanskyi. The combinatio nova is Euhelopus zdanskyi. The specific name honours Zdansky. Left premaxilla and maxilla Specimen PMU 24705 (formerly PMU R233) forms according to Wilson & Upchurch the holotype, descriptive basis, for the species Euhelopus zdanskyi. It represents one of the skeletons found by Zdansky, named \\"Exemplar a\\" by Wiman, who did not formally assign a holotype. This is the original skeleton found by Mertens. Specimen PMU 24705 consists of a partial skeleton with skull and lower jaws comprising these bones: the rostral part of the left nasal; a partial right jugal; the tapered jugal process of the postorbital, partially excavated; the dorsal process of the right quadratojugal; the fragmented left pterygoid (another fragment might be the right splenial, but it is too fragile to be removed from its matrix), a series of twenty-five presacral vertebrae and the left thighbone. The second skeleton, of an individual about as large as the holotype, was designated \\"Exemplar b\\" by Wiman. It was by Wilson & Upchurch referred to Euhelopus. This specimen PMU 24706, formerly PMU 234, comprises nine articulated dorsal vertebrae and the sacrum, two dorsal ribs, a nearly complete pelvis, and a right hindlimb lacking the fifth metatarsal and several pedal phalanges.\\"Euhelopus.\\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J. Michael & Weishampel, David B. The Age of Dinosaurs. Publications International, LTD. p. 70. . Both specimens are housed in the collection of the Paleontological Museum of Uppsala University, in Uppsala, Sweden, where the mounted skeletons are displayed since the 1930s. In 1923, Zdansky lacked the time to finish the excavation of the holotype. In the Autumn of 1934, Yang Zhongjian (\\"C.C. Young\\") and Bian Meinian (\\"M.N. Bien\\") returned to the quarry and secured four rear back vertebrae, a left shoulder girdle and a left humerus.C.-C. Young. 1935. \\"Dinosaurian remains from Mengyin, Shantung\\". Bulletin of the Geological Society of China 14(4): 519-533 These were provisionally designated \\"exemplar c\\" by Wilson & Upchurch in 2009. They considered it most likely that these bones belonged to the same individual as the holotype. They were informed in 2007 that this material could no longer be located in the Chinese collections. Classification Reconstructions of the skull Left dentary and surangular bones Wiman in 1929 was uncertain about the affinities of Helopus and placed it in a Helopodidae of its own. Yang made this a Helopodinae, first within the Morosauridae, then within the Brachiosauridae. Romer in 1956 created a Euhelopodinae. In 1990, John Stanton McIntosh placed Euhelopus in the Camarasauridae.McIntosh, J.S. 1990. \\"Sauropoda\\". Pp. 345-401 in: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P. & Osm√≥lska, H. (eds) The Dinosauria. University of California Press, Berkeley Wilson and Upchurch (2009) noted that cladistic assessments suggest that Euhelopus belonged to a clade of sauropods, the Euhelopodidae, that originated during an interval of geographic isolation and was endemic to this geographical range in China. It is not clear if the Euhelopodidae are monophyletic. Euhelopus demonstrates phylogenetic affinity to the taxon Titanosauria. Traditional claims that Euhelopus, Omeisaurus, Mamenchisaurus and Shunosaurus form the monophyletic family ‚ÄúEuhelopodidae‚Äù are not supported by new phylogenetic analysis. The cladogram below follows Jos√© L. Carballido, Oliver W. M. Rauhut, Diego Pol and Leonardo Salgado (2011). Paleoecology Restorations of the head Provenance and occurrence The type material for Euhelopus was excavated at the Mengyin Formation in Shandong (Shantung) Province, China. The specimens were collected by Otto Zdansky in 1923, in green/yellow sandstone and green/yellow siltstone. The Mengyin Formation dates to the Berriasian- Valanginian. It was previously regarded as having been deposited during the Barremian or Aptian stages of the Cretaceous period, about 129 to 113 million years ago. During the 1990s it was mistakenly thought the formation might date from the Late Jurassic.

Route 203 is poorly signed, but runs along part of the Arborway, Morton Street and Gallivan Boulevard, all parkways formerly part of the Metropolitan District Commission system of parks and roads. Maintenance Morton Street Prior to the creation of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) in 2009, the route was owned and maintained by the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR, previously the Metropolitan District Commission). On November 1, 2009, the Msgr. William Casey Highway overpass in Jamaica Plain, Morton Street in Mattapan and Gallivan Boulevard in Dorchester were transferred to MassDOT, while the Arborway continues to be maintained under the DCR. History Route 203 was designated in the early 1970s as part of a large Boston-area renumbering. Most of the route had been part of Route 3, which came south along the Jamaicaway with US 1 and split to the east onto the Arborway and along present Route 203. Route 3 turned south at Granite Avenue to join the Southeast Expressway in Milton, and Route 3A began southbound at the same location. With the renumbering, Route 3 was rerouted onto the Southeast Expressway (I-93) into downtown, Route 3A was truncated to its current end in Neponset (although it is technically concurrent with Route 3 between Boston and Burlington), and the former alignment of Routes 3 and 3A were redesignated as Route 203. While the former routes had been signed north- south, the new route was signed east-west to better reflect its actual direction of travel. In the 1980s, US 1 was removed from its surface alignment in Boston and instead cosigned with I-95 and I-93. As a result, Route 203 no longer terminates at a numbered route at its western end.

He is widely considered its most remarkable scholar and exponent. Taranatha was born in Tibet, supposedly on the birthday of Padmasambhava. His original name was Kun-dga'-snying-po, the Sanskrit equivalent of which is Anandagarbha. However, he adopted Taranatha, the Sanskrit name by which he was generally known, as an indication of the value he placed on his Sanskrit scholarship in an era when mastery of the language had become much less common in Tibet than it had once been. He was also paying homage to his Indian teacher, Buddhaguptanatha.\\"Buddhaguptanatha and the Late Survival of the Siddha Tradition in India,\\" by David Templeman His exceptional qualities are said to have been recognized by others at a young age, as is often the case with great masters. He studied under such masters as Je Draktopa, Yeshe Wangpo, Kunga Tashi and Jampa Lhundrup, although his primary teacher was Buddhaguptanatha. Taranatha was recognized by Khenchen Lungrik Gyatso as the rebirth of Krishnacarya and the Khenchen's own teacher, Jetsun Kunga Drolchok. Works Taranatha was a prolific writer and a renowned scholar. His best known work is the 143-folio History of Buddhism in India (dpal dus kyi 'khor lo'i chos bskor gyi byung khungs nyer mkho) of 1608,Synopsis by Nalinaksha Dutt, Chap. I-XIII Chap.

Other works are The Golden Rosary, Origins of the Tantra of the Bodhisattva Tara of 1604 which has also been translated into English. He was an advocate of the Shentong view of emptiness and wrote many texts and commentaries on this subject. English-language translation publications of his works on Shentong are The Essence of Other-EmptinessThe Essence of Other-Emptiness by Taranatha, translated and edited by Jeffrey Hopkins (Snow Lion, 2007) (which includes a translation of his Twenty One Profound Meanings (Zab don g—Åer gcig pa)) and his Commentary on the Heart Sutra.Taranatha's Commentary on the Heart Sutra by Adele Tomlin (Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, 2017) In 1614 Taranatha founded the important Jonangpa monastery Takten Dhamch√∂ling, in the Tsangpo Valley about 200 miles west of Lhasa.

This technology has both commercial and community applications. Voice broadcast users can contact targets (whether they be members, subscribers, constituents, employees, or customers) almost immediately. When used by government authorities, it may be known as an emergency notification system (since such notifications are intended only for use in emergencies). Voice broadcast systems manage a database of phone lists as well as digitally recorded phone messages. Using telephony components, these computers can simultaneously broadcast thousands of phone messages. Personalized information can be included in the phone messages through the integration of text-to- speech software. Advanced systems include telephony boards with answering- machine detection, and the logic to properly play a unique message to answering machines without message truncation. Interactive voice broadcasting Interactive voice broadcasting (also referred to as interactive voice messaging) programs allow the call recipient to listen to the recorded message and interact with the system by pressing keys on the phone keypad. The system can detect which key is pressed and be programmed to interact and play various messages accordingly. This is a form of Interactive voice response (IVR). for the interactive version, there will be an option to talk with the agent, so customers can talk directly with the agent for other questions. This is called a two-way IVR. The actions that can be programmed may include surveys, information confirmation, contact preference confirmation, or navigation through a phone menu. An example of the use of this technology is automated phone surveys, where professional polling organizations place automatic calls to conduct surveys. Respondents are provided survey questions that are answered using DTMF-tone keypad responses. More qualitative results can be captured by allowing call recipients to leave their own voice messages instead of just button presses. This function can not only be used for \\"grassroots\\" lobbying, but can be used to allow loved ones to leave voice messages for each other when separated after a disaster. Voice broadcasting law Voice broadcasting law is a subset of laws under telemarketing law. One of the most recent of these laws is the 2008 Telemarketing Sales Rule Amendment as issued by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Predictive dialing drop call rates and prerecorded message delivery restrictions were provided in the amendment. \\" Popularity Voice broadcasting is a popular method of direct marketing. Industry groups such as insurance, real estate, telemarketing, healthcare, direct sales, etc., have used it to create leads or as a follow-up method to their existing or past customers and/or current prospects. Also, one example of the popularity is its use by nonprofit organizations (NPOs). For example, an NPO can use voice broadcasting to send a simple \\"thank you\\" message to its donor base. This may be very valuable especially when an organization is a manpower constrained and there is a large donor list to call periodically, e.g., quarterly, to thank or to request additional donations. Two voice broadcasting methods for lead creation Two popular methods to create marketing leads with voice broadcasting are to deliver a prerecorded interactive message and the voicemail message. The prerecorded message is commonly referred to as the \\"press one\\" method. The dialer or voice broadcasting system calls the consumer, plays a marketing message, and then asks the recipient to press a number on their keypad (e.g., \\"1\\") to receive more information or to connect with a live agent. Instead of reaching the consumer, the consumer's answering machine may have answered the call. The dialer may use an answering machine detection (AMD) algorithm and leave a message on the prospect's answering machine. The objective is for the recipient to check and listen to their messages, and then to call back the phone number in the prerecorded message for more information. Both of these methods cost much less than making calls with live sales agents. Making a voice broadcast call in the U.S. costs one or two cents. The voice broadcast call does not have a significant labor cost (a $20/hour sales agent consumes $0.33 per minute). Live sales agents are expensive, so telemarketers using live agents will purchase marketing lists that identify good demographic targets. Voice broadcast marketing is cheap enough that marketers may not bother purchasing marketing lists. Voice broadcast marketing only needs live agents for those prospects who express interest in the product by pressing \\"1\\" or calling back. Consumers do not like automated cold calls,Public Law 102-243 ¬ß Findings so many jurisdictions have made marketing voice broadcasts illegal unless the recipient has previously consented to such calls. The U.S. Congress passed the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) in 1991.47 U.S.C. ¬ß 227 Recipients of illegal voice broadcast calls under the TCPA may sue the caller for statutory damages of $500 to $1500 per violation.47 U.S.C. ¬ß 227(b)(3) TCPA class actions have been settled for millions of dollars.Desai v ADT, Northern District of Illinois, 11 C 1925, settled for $15 million.https://www.bigclassaction.com/settlement/adt-robocalls-class-action- lawsuit-tcpa.php Even before the TCPA was enacted, state laws prohibited voice broadcast solicitations.

It was established by Premier Douglas Campbell after he was given a commission to do so by the Greater Winnipeg Investigating Commission. Winnipeg is a city in Manitoba, in the Country of Canada.  History  In August 1955 the Greater Winnipeg Investigating Commission was appointed by Premier Douglas Campbell to design and recommend a metropolitan level of governance for the Greater Winnipeg area. Commission members included Mayor George Sharpe of Winnipeg, Mayor J. G. Belleghem of St. Boniface, Mayor Thomas Findlay of St. James, Councillor C. N. Kushner of West Kildonan, and J. L. Bodie, former Mayor of East Kildonan. Their report was released at the end of March 1959. When implemented, it was the third form of metropolitan government instituted on the North American continent after Toronto (1954) and Dade County, Florida (1957). The original name for the governing entity would have been The Corporation of Metropolitan Winnipeg. However the Mayors did not like this name and had it changed in March 1960 to the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg. In 1960, the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg was established by Manitoba's Metropolitan Winnipeg Act as a separate layer of municipal government in the metropolitan area of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Bill 62 entered Second Reading stage in February 1960. Metro Winnipeg consisted of the City of Winnipeg and various surrounding municipalities, including Brooklands, Tuxedo, Charleswood, Transcona, West Kildonan, North Kildonan, East Kildonan, Old Kildonan, Saint Boniface, Saint Vital and Fort Garry. During the period of its existence, it provided services such as transit, parks, water and other municipal services to residents. Bonnycastle Park commemorating Metro's first Chairman. Metro government was established in November 1960 and absorbed the Greater Winnipeg Transit Commission on Jan. 1, 1961. During this time it operated under a Committees Council system, with six divisions reporting to an executive director. It ceased to exist upon the introduction of a unified municipal government (popularly known as \\"Unicity\\") by the Province of Manitoba under Premier Ed Schreyer, effective Jan. 1, 1972. The administration offices were located at 100 Main Street. The building was the administrative headquarters of the City of Winnipeg Streets & Transportation Department until 2007-2008 when the city handed it over to the Friends of Upper Fort Garry to make way for an expanded Upper Fort Garry Heritage park. On January 1, 1972 Metro had been dissolved in favour of combining all municipalities under one city. All former City, RM, Town Acts were repealed.  Responsibilities  Metro's responsibilities included: Planning for all major thoroughfares and bridge crossings. Operation of major and emerging parks over in size: Assiniboine Park, Kildonan Park, St. Vital Park, Crescent Drive Park. Property assessment. Provision of water, sewage, garbage, and public transit services to metro area municipalities.  Legacy  Metro Winnipeg attempted to introduce a co-ordinated approach planning between its member municipalities, and to that end it created several planning documents. Those documents included the Downtown Winnipeg Plan, the Winnipeg Area Transportation Study, and District Area Plans for the suburban municipalities of metropolitan Winnipeg. Metro Winnipeg was responsible for the operation of Metro Winnipeg Transit. Metro was involved in the initial plans for the Winnipeg Convention Centre. Under Metro the Transit garage on Assiniboine Avenue was closed. A new and larger Metro Transit Base on Osborne St. was opened in 1969. The route numbering system in place today was originally introduced as the Metro Route system.Testing went on during the 1960s, with final sign design and route numbering plan completed in July 1967 weeks before the start of the Pan Am Games.

In 1924 the party was recognized as the Palestinian section of the Communist International.Early Communism in Palestine, Fred Halliday, Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Winter, 1978), pp. 162-169 In its early years, the party was predominantly Jewish. History In 1923, at the party congress, a position of support was adopted in favour of the Arab national movement as a movement \\"opposed to British imperialism and denounced Zionism as a movement of the Jewish bourgeoisie allied to British imperialism\\", a move that won it membership of the Comintern.Younis, 2000, p. 117. The Party was also opposed to Zionist settlement in Palestine and to the Histadrut and its Jewish labor policy.Bernstein, 2000, p. 218. During the mid-1920s the party began recruiting Arab members. Karl Radek, as head of the Comintern's Eastern department, instructed the PCP that it must \\"become a party of Arab workers to which Jews can belong.\\" According to British intelligence sources, the first Arab joined the party in 1924. By 1925 the party had 8 Arab members. In that year the party was in contact with the Palestine Arab Workers Society. Simultaneously the party establish relations with elite sections of the local Arab society. According to Fred Halliday, many Christian Arabs were attracted towards the party since they, being Orthodox, felt emotional bonds with Russia. Representatives from the party at the League against Imperialism's 1927 conference in Brussels clashed with Poale Zion, forming an anti-Zionist bloc with Arab nationalists from Palestine, Egypt and Syria within the League. However, when the Comintern made its ultra-left turn in 1928 and denounced cooperation with national bourgeoisies in the colonies, the process of strengthening of the party amongst the Arab population was stalled. In 1930 the Comintern did yet another sharp turn, urging its Palestinian section to speedily increase the Arab representation amongst its cadres and leaders. In December 1930, PCP ran in the elections for the Jewish Assembly of Representatives in Mandate Palestine, using a front organization called the Proletarian Party (Harishima Haproletarit). The party failed dismally. During the rule of Joseph Stalin, the party militants in the Soviet Union suffered from heavy purges, including numerous people close to party leader Leopold Trepper. Daniel Averbach, one of the founders of the party, was brutally beaten and went mad.Radzisnki, 1996. Tepper, himself, was expelled from Palestine by the British in 1929 and moved to Europe. During World War II, he led the Red Orchestra spy ring. In 1943 the party split, with the Arab members forming the National Liberation League in 1944.Beinin 40, 42 The PCP and NLL both initially opposed the 1947 UN Partition Plan, but accepted it after the Soviet Union endorsed it.Beinin45-48 The PCP changed its name to MAKEI, the Communist Party of Eretz Israel, after endorsing partition in October 1947. This was the first time the communists had used the term 'Eretz Israel' ('Land of Israel') in a party‚Äôs name. However, it had been a widespread practice in Mandate Palestine to translate 'Palestine' as 'Eretz Israel' when translating into Hebrew.Beinin 46 The party still viewed partition as a temporary detour on the road to a binational state. The two parties maintained contact during the 1948 war, and after the war, the NLL merged with Maki (the new name adopted by Maki, meaning the Communist Party of Israel) within the new state's borders.Beinin 52 From 1951 the Jordanian Communist Party organized Palestinians in the West Bank while a new Palestinian Communist Organization mobilized members in Gaza City. In 1975 a Palestinian Communist Organization was formed in the West Bank as a branch of the Jordanian party. In 1982 it severed ties with Jordan and merged with the organization in Gaza to become the new Palestine Communist Party.Connell, 2001, p. 61. This Party later became the Palestinian People's Party. In 1987, it joined the Palestine Liberation Organization.Kawar, 1996, p. xii.

He was a lieutenant colonel in the local militia. Born in Hertfordshire, England, he settled in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He is the patriarch of the Washington family, being the colonist paternal English ancestor and great- grandfather of George Washington, general of the Continental Army and first president of the United States of America. Early life and family John Washington was possibly born about 1631Westmoreland Co, VA Deeds, Patents & Wills, 1665‚Äì1677, p. 247a, 5 January 1675:6, deposition of Col. John Washington, age 45. in Tring, Hertfordshire, England. This birth year is based on a deposition he gave about 5 January 1675:6 that says he was age 45. Other people believe he was born between February and May 1634. This is based on an estimated marriage date of May ‚Äì June 1633 for his parents. He was a son of Rev. Lawrence Washington (1602‚Äì1652) and Amphillis Twigden. At the time of his marriage, Lawrence Washington was a don at the University of Oxford. When John was eight his father enrolled him in Charterhouse School in London to begin preparing for an academic career, but the boy never attended the school. In 1633 the senior Washington had left Oxford when called as the Rector of Purleigh, Essex. During the English Civil War, in 1643 the royalist Washington was stripped of his clerical position by the Parliamentary Puritans. He was reduced to serving as a Vicar of an impoverished parish in Little Braxted, Essex. His wife and family returned to her parents' family home in Tring, Hertfordshire. John Washington was apprenticed with a London merchant through the help of his Sandys relatives. He gained a valuable education in colonial trade, as England had colonies in the Caribbean and North America. In 1656 John Washington invested in a merchant ship engaged in transporting tobacco from North America to European markets; he sailed it from England for the Colony of Virginia. Washington served as the ship's second officer. In 1657, the ship foundered in the Potomac River. Although the vessel was repaired, Washington elected to remain in the colony. He was accompanied to Virginia by his cousin, James Washington, the son of Robert Washington (1616 - 1674), who worked in the London-Rotterdam trade of the Merchant Adventurers. James subsequently returned to England. Survey of 1674, certified by Thomas Lee, for 5,000-acre land grant Colony of Virginia While first in Virginia, Washington stayed at the house of Col. Nathaniel Pope, a planter. During this stay, he fell in love with his host's daughter Anne. He settled at a site on Bridges Creek.Marquis, A.N. Company. Who's Who in America, vol. 1: Historical Volume (1607‚Äì1896), revised ed., Marquis, A.N. Company., 1967. After his marriage to Anne Pope, the couple received a wedding gift from Anne's father of on Mattox Creek in Westmoreland County of the Northern Neck. Washington became a successful planter, depending on the labour of African slaves and British indentured servants to cultivate tobacco as a commodity crop and the necessary kitchen crops to support the household and workers. He was selected for the Virginia House of Burgesses and became a politician in the colony. In 1674, he received a land grant, adding to his estate and power. (See image) During the events leading to Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, Washington was appointed a colonel in the Virginia militia. He led a company to back a group of Marylanders during a planned parley with the disgruntled opposition and their allied American Indian leaders. The militia killed six chiefs of various tribes. Outraged, their peoples later retaliated, conducting raids and attacks against the colonists. Governor William Berkeley strongly criticised Washington for the murders of the American Indian chiefs, but colonists supported him.Nicholas Spencer The Governor would later be replaced by John's cousin Nicholas Spencer who had traveled with him on his ship. Relations between the Indians and colonists deteriorated. Marriage and family John Washington married Anne Pope in 1658. He wrote a letter to Gov. Josias Fendall of Maryland dated 30 September 1659, which states that his \\"young sonne\\" will be baptised on 4 October 1659. This suggests he was married at least 9 months before 30 September, possibly in late 1658.
