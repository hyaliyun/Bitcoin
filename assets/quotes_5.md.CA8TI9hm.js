A closeup in Fantasy Canyon, Utah Rocks in Fantasy Canyon Differentially cemented & eroded sandstone in Fantasy Canyon, Utah Fantasy Canyon is a Bureau of Land Management-managed area located about south of Vernal, in Uintah County, Utah. Even though the area is only about in size, it contains some of the most unusual geologic features in the world. The site was officially documented by early explorer and paleontologist Earl Douglass, who recorded the area by other names such as ‚ÄúThe Devil‚Äôs Playground‚Äù and ‚ÄúHades Pit.‚Äù He published photographs of this area in a 1909 publication called ‚ÄúThe Columbian Magazine.‚Äù  Geology  The rocks of Fantasy Canyon, quartzose sandstones, were deposited during the Eocene Epoch. They date from around 38 to 50 million years ago. During the geologic period, the Uinta Basin was occupied by a large lake called Lake Uinta. The lake extended west to Heber City, east to Rangely, Colorado, south to the Book Cliff Divide, north to the Uinta Mountains, and was about a half mile deep. Stratigraphy: member C, Uinta Formation, Eocene. Fantasy Canyon is along the east shore of what was once Lake Uinta, where the sediments eroded from the surrounding high lands. Sediments were deposited and the once loose sands, silts, and clays were forged into sandstone and shale. Because of different rates of weathering, the more durable sandstone remained while the more easily weathered siltstone and shale washed away, yielding this spectacular scenery. Today‚Äôs geologic formations of Fantasy Canyon will eventually give way to weather and then topple and erode into sand, but new formations will appear as the topsoil washes away. Because the delicate formations are so fragile the area is referred to as ‚ÄúNature‚Äôs China Shop.‚Äù  Mineralization  There are black ribbons of coal-like material along the small washes on the trail or as horizontal stripes in the rocks. This magnetic material is called magnetite (iron oxide). There are inch-wide, black-colored, subvertical, northwest-southeast trending gilsonite dikes that have intruded the rocks at Fantasy Canyon. Gilsonite, named after U.S. Marshall Samuel H. Gilson, is a type of asphaltite - solidified hydrocarbons. Gilsonite was discovered in the early 1860s. Starting in the mid-1880s, Gilson promoted the material as a waterproof coating for wooden pilings, as an insulation for wire cable, and as a unique varnish.  Fossils  The Eocene-aged Uinta Formation is fossiliferous. It contains widely scattered bones, mostly mammals, which roamed the Basin during the Eocene. Fossilized turtle shells are visible in the area.  References  *Archived BLM website page for Fantasy Canyon External links * Photo Gallery from Fantasy Canyon.

Special education In December 2013, Austin Area School District administration reported that 49 pupils or 22% of the District's pupils received Special Education services, with 32% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2012, the District administration reported that 46 pupils or 23.6% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 39% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2011, the Austin Area School District administration reported that 46 pupils or 20% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 47% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2010, the Austin Area School District administration reported that 38 pupils or 19% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 63% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2009, 21% of pupils received special education services. This was significantly higher than the state rate of 15% of pupils. The District used services provided by the IU 12 to meet the needs of these students. Total enrollment in the district was reported at 193 pupils in 2009. In 2008 enrollment was 220 pupils in the district. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full day kindergarten would be recouped by Districts in lower special education costs. AASD has offered full day kindergarten since 2008 and preschool since 2009. Austin Area School District has seen a minimal in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Senator Patrick Browne, Senate Education Committee Holds Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability, November 1, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Pennsylvania Department of Education Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, November 11, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth.

For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 For the 2014-2015 school year, Austin Area School District received an increase to $135,258 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The District must apply for this added funding. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that none of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Gifted Students as Percentage of Total Enrollment by School District/Charter School, July 2010 By law, the District must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education for Gifted Students Notice of Parental rights, March 26, 2010 Wellness policy Austin Area School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006.Austin Area School Board Policy Manual, Student Wellness Policy 246, 2006 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The District offers a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Austin Area School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. A nurse is available in the building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. =Highmark Healthy High 5 grants= In 2011, the Austin Area School District received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant.

Tuition Students who live in the District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Austin Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the Austin Area School District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $13,417.68, High School - $13,735.17. Audit In a 2012 audit of the Austin Area District, the administration was cited by the Pennsylvania Auditor General for continuing a practice of permitting non- resident students to attend The District's schools without paying full tuition, as required by the Pennsylvania School Code. The practice has cost the District tens of thousands over the previous 6 years.

Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010‚Äì2011 school year is 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as local property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

Enrollment According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, Austin Area's total enrollment K-12 is 181 students. There were 23 students in the Class of 2009. The senior class of 2010 had 17 students. Enrollment in Austin Area School District is projected by the Pennsylvania Department of Education to continue to decline to a district wide enrollment of 147 students in 2017. The district ranks 3rd out of 500 public school districts in the Commonwealth for spending on administration.Fenton, Jacob., Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 A study of Pennsylvania public school spending, conducted by Standard and Poor's, examined the consolidation of Austin Area School District Administration with neighboring Galeton Area School District. The study found that consolidation of the administrations would achieve substantial administrative cost savings of over $1 million. The study also examined administrative consolidation of Austin Area School District with Smethport Area School District. It found a savings of $632,105. According to a report by The Center for Rural Pennsylvania, rural Pennsylvania public school enrollment has declined by 8 percent since 2000. The most significant enrollment decline was in western Pennsylvania, where rural school districts experienced a 16 percent decline. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater). From 2000 to 2009, Pennsylvania experienced a decline of over 50,000 pupils statewide. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants released a report finding that the state would save hundreds of millions of tax dollars, by cutting the number of school administrations in half through consolidation, with no impact on programs offered to students. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. According to a 2009 school district administration consolidation proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improve lagging academic achievement, to enrich the academic programs or to reduce property taxes. Consolidation of two central administrations into one would not require the closing of any local schools. In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the 49 respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools.Study of the cost-effectiveness of consolidating Pennsylvania districts.

John Boland of the Irish Independent claimed the series became \\"more religious in thrust and tone as it progressed\\". He described the episode featuring Neil Jordan as a \\"bizarre encounter\\", in which the writer and filmmaker \\"grew more and more bemused\\" as Byrne questioned him in great detail about his religious faith. Jordan answered such questions as \\"Do you think your religion might return to you on your deathbed?\\" and \\"Do you think there's a day of reckoning?\\" with \\"I really haven't got a clue\\" and \\"I don't know, Gay\\" but when he commented that \\"every time I'm in a plane and it's hit by lightning I bless myself\\", Byrne replied \\"Hah!\\", as if, according to Boland, Jordan had \\"just revealed a basic faith in the Catholic Almighty rather than a reflex reaction to imminent catastrophe\\". The Irish Timess Kevin Courtney said of The Meaning of Life: \\"The title is a bit grandiose ‚Äì you could just as easily call it Tell Uncle Gaybo All About It.

In 1965 Hopkins purchased the ski lift division and all the related assets from Roebling & Sons. Business picked up as a competitor, Universal Design Ltd., discontinued manufacturing Sky Rides, and their customers turned to Hopkins Engineering for parts. Hopkins' first customer in the amusement business was Charles Wood of Storytown USA who owned a Universal Design ski lift and contracted Hopkins to provide parts and maintenance. In 1969 Hopkins sold his first Sky Glider chairlift to Paragon Park in Massachusetts. In 1971 Hopkins changed the name of his company to O.D. Hopkins Associates Inc. O.D.

She made her debut as a geisha in 2007 in the district of Tokyo under the name , and as of 2016 was working in the district of Tokyo. Early life Graham was born in Melbourne, Australia, and first travelled to Japan aged 15 for a student exchange programme, where she attended high school and lived with her host family. Academic career Graham's first degrees, in psychology and teaching, were taken at Keio University. She completed an M.Phil. in 1992 and a D.Phil. 2001 in social anthropology at the University of Oxford, focusing on Japanese corporate culture. She has lectured at the National University of Singapore, and been a lecturer on geisha studies at Keio and Waseda Universities since 2008. Graham has published three volumes of anthropology. Inside the Japanese Company (2003) and A Japanese Company in Crisis (2005) are about the large insurance company (given the fictional name \\"C‚ÄëLife\\") that she joined upon graduation, and which she later observed, first as a researcher and later as a documentary film maker.Tony Elger, \\"Japanese employment relations after the bubble\\", British Journal of Industrial Relations 44 (2006): 801‚Äì805, . (Review of Graham's Inside the Japanese Company and A Japanese Company in Crisis and of Ross Mouer and Hirosuke Kawanishi's A Sociology of Work in Japan.) Her major subject is \\"the uneven erosion of the commitment of [the company's] salary men to an overarching corporate ideology\\"; she concentrates on the cohort who entered the company when she did; the reviewer of both these books for the British Journal of Industrial Relations viewed her portrayal favourably, but thought that it \\"[did] not adequately address wider issues of structure and power relations\\". The reviewer for the journal Organization of Inside the Japanese Company was troubled by the uninformativeness about Graham's interviewees and by serious problems with the book's quantitative survey. Nevertheless, he found the book insightful and rewarding.Leo McCann, \\"Lives under pressure: Exploring the work of Japanese middle managers\\", Organization: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Organization, Theory and Society 12 (2005): 142‚Äì144, . (Review of Graham's Inside the Japanese Company and Peter Matanle's Japanese Capitalism and Modernity in a Global Era.) \\"C‚ÄëLife eventually went bust in October 2000\\",Leo McCann, \\"Pop goes the bubble: Japanese white-collar workers face up to hard times\\", Organization: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Organization, Theory and Society 13 (2006):158‚Äì160 .

The reviewer again found flaws with the book, but on balance gave it a highly favourable review. The review of the book in Social Science Japan Journal had similar high praise for it.Kuniko Ishiguro, untitled review of A Japanese Company in Crisis, Social Science Japan Journal 9 (2006): 141‚Äì143, . In Playing at Politics: An Ethnography of the Oxford Union (2005), Graham built on a 2001 documentary (The Oxford Union: Campus of Tradition) that she had made for Japanese television about candidacy for president of the Oxford Union: :Graham focuses on the highly ambitious individuals who decide that their future careers will benefit more from being known as former Presidents of the Oxford Union than from the quality of their degrees. . . . The carping comments from those on the sidelines, who view the candidates as slimy self- degraders desperate for status, provide an amusing counterpoint to the seriousness of the contestants.Margaret Taylor, untitled review of Playing at Politics, Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 12 (2006): 983‚Äì984, . The reviewer for the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute found the book a \\"witty examination of British political processes\\" and \\"[recommended it] to all would-be politicians and their tutors\\". Geisha activities (on the left) and one of her trainees in January 2013 Graham initially entered the geisha profession whilst directing a documentary project for the National Geographic Channel; however, upon completing her training as a part of the film, she was given permission to continue working full-time as a geisha, and formally debuted under the name of (meaning \\"transparent happiness\\") in December 2007. Graham debuted in the geisha district of Tokyo, and her training before this lasted for a year; this included lessons on dance, tea ceremony and the . Graham specialises in (the Japanese side-blown flute), having played the flute for a number of years before coming to Japan. As of 2013, the documentary itself remained unfinished. After working in for four years as a geisha, Graham applied for permission to take over the run by her geisha mother, who was retiring due to ill health; her request was denied on the grounds of her being a foreigner. In 2011, Graham left to operate independently of the Geisha Association, though she continued to work as a geisha within the area, opening a kimono shop in in the same year. In 2013, Graham was running an independent in , Tokyo with four apprentices, and as of 2019, has been running an in the district of Tokyo, also with four apprentices. Graham has travelled internationally to demonstrate the traditional arts employed by geisha, visiting the United Kingdom to perform at the Hyper Japan festival in 2013, Dubai in the same year, and Brazil in 2015. Wanaka Gym court case In December 2010, a company owned solely by Graham, The Wanaka Gym Ltd., was fined a total of NZ$64,000 and ordered to pay NZ$9,000 in costs, following a conviction relating to an unsafe building used for tourist accommodation. The building had been declared \\"dangerous\\" in June 2008, but continued to house paying residents in the two months after. After the conviction, Graham made a number of unsuccessful appeals, and a final leave to appeal by both Graham and the company was rejected in December 2014 by the Supreme Court of New Zealand.\\"The Wanaka Gym Limited v Queenstown Lakes District Council (2014) NZSC: Judgement of the Court\\" (PDF).

The oldest finds at the archaeological ruins of Lokvi≈°ƒáe date back to the Stone Age (6500 BC - 4000 BC). In the Bay of Lokvi≈°ƒáe, there were found a large number of broken amphorae. This indicates that Lokvi≈°ƒáe was a small port with warehouses for the production and storage of wine and olive oil. In the 8th and 9th Century this area was populated by Croats, from the northern region of Dalmatia.

NAFTA's proponents believe that more jobs were ultimately created in the USA. Opponents see the agreements as having been costly to well-paying American jobs.  Overview  The economic impacts of NAFTA have been modest. In a 2015 report, the Congressional Research Service summarized multiple studies as follows: \\"In reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters. The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP. However, there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment among their economies.\\"CRS-Villarreal and Fergusson-The North American Free Trade Agreement-April 16, 2015 In a 2003 report, the Congressional Budget Office wrote: \\"CBO estimates that the increased trade resulting from NAFTA has probably increased U.S. gross domestic product, but by a very small amount‚Äîprobably a few billion dollars or less, or a few hundredths of a percent.\\" CBO estimated that NAFTA added $10.3 billion to exports and $9.4 billion to imports in 2001.CBO-The Effects of NAFTA on U.S.-Mexican Trade and GDP For scale, that was roughly 10% of the trade activity with Mexico in that year.U.S. Census Bureau-Trade in Goods with Mexico-Retrieved August 10, 2016 Several other studies discussed below argue that impacts on particular U.S. industries were more significant and that the U.S. labor movement was weakened by opening trade with Mexico, a lower wage country.  Job loss The image shows the U.S. trade in goods with Mexico from 1992-2015. NAFTA became effective January 1, 1994.In 1987, the U.S. was the destination of 69.2% of Mexico‚Äôs exports and the U.S. accounted for 74% of Mexico‚Äôs imports. In 2013, the U.S. was the destination of 78.8% of exports and accounted for 49.1% of the imports to the country. The agricultural and manufacturing industrial sectors were the hardest hit areas by NAFTA Studies done by Kate Bronfenbrenner at Cornell University showed the effects of plants threatening to move to Mexico and Canada because of NAFTA.Kate Bronfenbrenner, 'We'll Close', The Multinational Monitor, March 1997, based on the study she directed, 'Final Report: The Effects of Plant Closing or Threat of Plant Closing on the Right of Workers to Organize'. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the rise in the trade deficit with Mexico alone since NAFTA was enacted led to the net displacement of 682,900 U.S. jobs by 2010.Scott, Robert E. Economic Policy Institute. 3 May 2011. Retrieved 10 Nov. 2011 Heading South: U.S.-Mexico trade and job displacement after NAFTA. A 2003 paper released by the Economic Policy Institute noted that President George W. Bush and other proponents of trade liberalization often cited only potential job gains from increased exports. The 2003 paper noted that increases in imports ultimately displaced the production of goods that would have been made domestically by workers within the United States.Scott, Robert E. Economic Policy Institute. 17 Nov. 2003. Retrieved 22 Apr. 2008 The High Price of Free Trade. According to the Economic Policy Institute's study, 61% of the net job losses due to trade with Mexico under NAFTA, or 415,000 jobs, were relatively high paying manufacturing jobs. Certain states with heavy emphasis on manufacturing industries like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and California were significantly affected by these job losses. However, in Ohio, Trade Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA-TAA identified only 14,653 jobs directly lost due to NAFTA-related reasons like relocation of U.S. firms to Mexico.Honeck, Jon (February 2004). International Trade and Job Loss in Ohio. A report from Policy Matters Ohio. Retrieved 2016-08-22. In Pennsylvania, Keystone Research Center attributed 38,325 in job losses in the state to trade with Mexico and Canada.Keystone Research Center. 2001. 28 Apr. 2008 Job Losses Due to Trade Since NAFTA Deepen Pennsylvania Manufacturing Crisis. Since 1993, 38,325 of those job losses are directly related to trade with Mexico and Canada. Although many of these workers laid off due to NAFTA were reallocated to other sectors, the majority of workers were relocated to the service industry, where average wages are 4/5 to that of the manufacturing sector. Opponents also argue that the ability for firms to increase capital mobility and flexibility has undermined the bargaining power of U.S. workers. In addition to enjoying lower tariffs for shipping goods from Mexico to the United States, multinational corporations also benefited from NAFTA's unprecedented section giving multinational corporations the right to sue governments for infringement of \\"investment rights\\".US Department of State.

Specifically within NAFTA's first five years of existence, 709,988 jobs (140,000 annually), were created domestically.Hufbauer, Gary C., and Jeffrey J. Scott. NAFTA Revisited: Achievements and Challenges. Washington, DC: Institute for International Economics, 2005. The mid to late nineties was a period of strong economic growth in the United States. When a country is experiencing economic growth (i.e. GDP is increasing), there is usually also an increase in employment.Hubbard, Glenn, and Anthony P. O'brien. Macroeconomics. Upper Saddle River: Pearson: Prentice Hall, 2006. 233‚Äì34. Thus, because trade liberalization can sometimes contribute to increases in GDP, it can help to bring the rate of unemployment down in a country. The U.S. experienced a 48% increase in real GDP from 1993‚Äì2005. The unemployment rate over this period was an average of only 5.1%, compared to 7.1% from 1982‚Äì1993, before NAFTA was implemented. Critics of NAFTA argue that the 1990s economic boom was driven by technological change, however, and that employment growth in the 1990s would have been even greater without NAFTA.Salas, Carlos, Jeff Faux, and Robert E. Scott. Economic Policy Institute. 28 Sept. 2006. Retrieved 10 Nov. 2011 Revisiting NAFTA: Still not working for North America's workers. Proponents reject the claims of some that the free trade agreement is destroying the manufacturing industry and causing displacement of workers in that industry. The rate of job loss due to plant closings, a typical argument against NAFTA, showed little deviation from previous periods.Kletzer, Lori G. Journal of Economic Perspectives 12 (1998): 115‚Äì36. 25 Apr. 2008 Job Displacement. Also, US industrial production, in which manufacturing makes up 78%, saw an increase of 49% from 1993‚Äì2005. The period prior to NAFTA, 1982‚Äì1993, only saw a 28% increase. In fact, according to NAM, National Association of Manufacturers, NAFTA has only been responsible for 10% of the manufactured goods trade deficit, something opponents criticize the agreement for exacerbating.National Association of Manufacturers.

Democratic Leadership Council. 1 Oct. 1997. 22 Apr. 2008 NAFTA's Effect on U.S. Jobs: a Small But Positive Impact After Three Years. It is estimated that 8500 manufacturing jobs are supported by every $1 billion in US exports. Because $12 billion of average annual gains in exports were created by expansion of North American trade, more than 100,000 additional US jobs were created, but this measure does not account for jobs lost due to rising imports. More importantly, it has been noted that in export-oriented industries, wages are 13-16 percent higher than the national average. Others agree with the notion that there has been an increase in net jobs due to NAFTA's implementation, but also believe that these net gains are coming at the price of worker's wages. That is, high-paying manufacturing jobs are being lost and replaced by lower paying jobs and is causing wage deflation in certain sectors. However, during the Clinton administration, the sources of new job creation were in relatively high paid sectors and industries.

The aircraft crashed while on approach to Tulc√°n's Teniente Coronel Luis A. Mantilla International Airport on January 28, 2002. The pilot flew the approach incorrectly in reportedly foggy conditions, and the aircraft flew into the side of the Cumbal Volcano, located near Ipiales, Colombia, at 10:23 in the morning. All passengers and crew were killed in the crash. Flight chronology The aircraft involved in the crash, seen at Fort Lauderdale Airport in October 1998 The Boeing 727-100 departed Quito at 10:03 local time, taking off from Runway 17. The aircraft climbed to a cruising altitude of and proceeded north-north-east along the G-675 airway. The first leg, between Quito and Tulc√°n, was a short one. At 10:15 HC-BLF made contact with the Tulc√°n control tower, at which point it was positioned from the Tulc√°n NDB. The crew were given permission to descend to , and were provided with the weather conditions and cleared for the approach. The NDB approach to Runway 23 at Teniente Coronel Luis A. Mantilla Airport would take the airplane directly over the airport, bearing 085 degrees; the aircraft would then make a left-hand turn to heading 233 after 1.5 minutes, flying at IAS, all the while descending to a final altitude of . The elevation of the runway is ; there are numerous mountain ridges and peaks located in the vicinity of the airport, which is located high in the Andes mountains. The Cumbal Volcano, which rises to an altitude of , is located less than due west of the airport. El Oro entered the approach from the southwest, passing slightly west of the NDB, as opposed to directly over it. The pilot began the turn correctly, but was flying too fast; the aircraft was flying at , rather than the required 180. This took the 727 wide of its intended course; by the time it came around to a westerly heading, it was flying not towards the runway, but into the side of the Cumbal Volcano. The aircraft crashed into the side of the mountain at 10:23 AM, after which no further contact was made with the flight. The impact occurred at an elevation of , some below the volcano's summit. Visibility was very poor at the time of the accident; the wreckage was not found until almost a day later. Investigation The investigation committee of the Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics (Colombia) found the probable cause of the accident to be the following: > 1\\\\.

He served as a member of the TUC general council for 12 years to 1983, having first joined the union in 1937, and he had held offices at every level in the electricians' union. From 1966 to 1984 he was the general secretary of the EETPU. After his retirement, he was elevated to the House of Lords as a life peer on 4 February 1985 taking the title Baron Chapple, of Hoxton in Greater London. His successor was fellow anti-communist Eric Hammond. One of Chapple's sons, Barry Chapple, was a regional official of Amicus, which succeeded the EETPU. Amicus merged with the TGWU in 2007 to become Unite the Union.

Hammond was born in Northfleet, Kent, and was evacuated to Newfoundland, Canada during World War II, returning to the UK in 1945. He served his apprenticeship as an electrician with the Bowater paper company, and in 1950 was called up for national service, serving for two years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. In 1947 he joined the Labour Party. Hammond, like his predecessors Leslie Cannon and Frank Chapple, ostensibly started his career on the Left, but, unlike them, was never an actual member of the Communist Party. In 1977 he was appointed an OBE. In 1982 he was elected to succeed Chapple as general secretary of the EETPU, a post he occupied fully from 1984. Hammond opposed nearly everything in the tradition of conventional trade unionism, for which he was referred to as \\"right wing\\". The most famous example was \\"no strike\\" clauses. Eric Hammond and Arthur Scargill famously fell out at the 1984 TUC conference when he described the 1984-85 miners' strike as \\"lions led by donkeys\\". He refused to take the electricians in to the strike on the side of the miners, even though many the union's members wanted to, and thus without the power of the electricians it is thought he prolonged the strike for many months.Obituary in The Guardian He died on 30 May 2009, aged 79, after a lengthy illness.

He is a former American government official, physician and health economist who served as the 16th Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from 2010‚Äì2015.  Background, education and early career  Shah was born to Indian Gujarati immigrant parents who settled in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the late 1960s. He grew up in the Detroit area and attended Wylie E. Groves High School. He graduated with honors, Phi Beta Kappa, from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science in Economics. At Michigan, he was awarded the Otto Graf Scholarship, given to one student university-wide for leadership excellence and academic distinction. He went on to earn a Master of Science in Health Economics from the University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School of Business and a Doctor of Medicine from the University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine. While a grad student, he created Project Impact for South Asian Americans, a non-profit organization through which he raised small dollar donations for his new community service organization. Additionally, while studying at the Wharton School of Business, Shah was awarded a $500,000 grant from U.S. Healthcare to develop econometric tools to improve hospital efficiency. Shah also spent time at the London School of Economics where he earned a general course certificate in economics. During the 2000 Gore-Lieberman Presidential Campaign, Shah was a health policy advisor and research associate. He also served as a member of Governor Ed Rendell's (D-PA) transition committee on health.  The Gates Foundation  Shah joined the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2001, serving in a range of leadership roles including Director of Agricultural Development, Director of Strategic Opportunities, Deputy Director of Policy and Finance and Chief Economist. During his time at Gates, he led the launch of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, an alliance with the Rockefeller Foundation that focuses on addressing the specific environmental and agricultural needs of African farmers. Shah was also responsible for developing the International Finance Facility for Immunization, which raised more than $5 billion for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). IFFI has been recognized as an example of the power of innovative financing for global development.  Obama administration  = United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) = Shah was nominated by President Obama to serve as Chief Scientist and Undersecretary of Agriculture for Research, Education and Economics on April 17, 2009. He was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on May 12, 2009. Shah was responsible for management and oversight of the U.S. Government's Agricultural Research Service, Economic Research Service, Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, National Agricultural Statistics Service. Shah also led the creation and launch of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to bring peer-reviewed scientific processes to agricultural research. = United States Agency for International Development (USAID) = January 7, 2010: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the swearing-in ceremony of Shah as new USAID Coordinator, in Washington, DC.Shah was nominated to serve as the 16th Administrator of USAID on November 10, 2009 and confirmed by the United States Senate unanimously on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2009. He was sworn into office by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on January 7, 2010.  Emergency management  On his fifth day as Administrator, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Port-au-Prince, Haiti, that destroyed the capital and killed more than 200,000 citizens. Shah was tasked by President Obama to lead the United States response to the disaster, launching one of the largest humanitarian efforts in history. USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah listens to the story of a young Somali woman who walked for 33 days with her children to reach Dadaab camp in Kenya. Throughout his tenure, Shah would lead the U.S. Government response to major crises and natural disasters including the famine in the Horn of Africa where more than 13 million people were in need of assistance. In 2014, Shah led the U.S. response to the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. The response is credited with slowing the rate of new infections faster than had been projected, which prevented significant transmission across Africa and to other parts of the world.  Reforming USAID  In addition to overseeing America's response to international crises and humanitarian assistance, Shah worked to reform how USAID conducted business. He promoted a new model of development based on engagement with the private sector. As co-chair of the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR), a comprehensive evaluation led by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to redefine diplomacy and development, Shah worked to incorporate development as a part of an integrated, values-driven national security strategy. He earned bipartisan support for his efforts, which included increasing his Agency's budget growth during a time of sequestration. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah responding to questions on the flooding in Pakistan at the U.S. Department of State in Washington, D.C., on August 4, 2010. Internally, Shah launched USAID Forward, a set of reforms that touched nearly every part of the Agency, including contractor and procurement policies. He returned budget and policy oversight back to USAID from the State Department, recruited top talent from other fields, increased the number of foreign service officers, and established the Administrator's Leadership Council.  Food security reform  Shah led efforts to reform food security in an effort to fight against hunger around the world. His efforts had a broad, bipartisan coalition in support of global development in the United States Congress, resulting in a fivefold increase in America's overall investment in fighting hunger through investments in agriculture. Shah used the Camp David G8 Summit in 2012 to attract private investment commitments to the effort. The U.S. Government's Feed the Future initiative has been documented to have moved nearly 40 million people out of hunger and poverty and led to dramatic reductions in child stunting around the world.  Maternal and child health  As Administrator of USAID, Shah restructured $2.9 billion of global health investments to focus on cost-effective ways to save lives of children under the age of five in priority countries. He created a partnership co-led by Ethiopia, India and UNICEF, \\"A Promise Renewed\\", to have more than one hundred partner countries restructure health priorities and invest in measurement to deliver better outcomes. As a result of these and other efforts, the global level of child deaths is coming down faster than previously expected.  U.S. Global Development Lab  Shah continued building on his new model of development in 2014 when he announced the establishment of the United States Global Development Lab. The Lab brings together public and private sector partners to support innovative development solutions in areas that include water, health, food security, nutrition, energy, education and climate change. The U.S. Global Development Lab, a key recommendation of the first QDDR, increased the number of scientists and technology experts within USAID, including 65 fellows from the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). He increased the investment in science, technology and innovation, taking Agency spend from roughly $130 million when he became Administrator to over $600 million, to focus not only on research, but also on innovation and applied solutions in science and technology.

(Official White House Photo by Pete Souza) At the launch of the Lab in New York, Shah stated: \\"To solve our most intractable development challenges, USAID has established a new way of working, bringing on board the best and brightest staff and new partners, all working in concert to help end extreme poverty. The Lab will engage a global community of inventors, academics, researchers, entrepreneurs, investors, and corporate leaders in science and technology to invent, test, and scale the most promising and cost effective solutions to end extreme poverty.\\"  Power Africa  In 2013, President Obama launched Power Africa, bringing together technical and legal experts, the private sector, and governments from around the world to work in partnership to increase the number of people with access to power. As Administrator, Shah led the Administration's efforts to secure billions of dollars of private investments for African power development to bring more than 26,000 MW of power online.  National Prayer Breakfast  In 2014, Administrator Shah was invited to keynote the 62nd Annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC. Raj Shah briefs Dr. Jill Biden, Dr. Bill Frist and others en route to Dagahaley refugee camp, Aug. 8, 2011. (Official White House Photo by David Lienemann)  Bipartisan outreach  To institutionalize efforts to transform development, Shah worked closely with Congressional leaders and a broad range of non-government stakeholders on a select set of legislative priorities. In recent years, President Obama has signed many of these into law. The Global Food Security Act is the second largest global development authorizing legislation in recent history. The Electrify Africa Act has institutionalized Power Africa and the Agriculture Act (\\"Farm Bill\\") included the most significant legislative reforms in American food aid in sixty years. Shah's effort to enlist Congress as a real partner and build a broad bipartisan coalition to support these priorities is credited in large part for their passage.  Later career  Shah resigned from USAID on January 30, 2015. He was appointed Distinguished Fellow in Residence at Georgetown University, Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, developing and teaching a graduate seminar on Rethinking Global Development and National Security policy with an emphasis on fragile states, data and innovation. He also founded and serves as Managing Partner for Latitude Capital, a global emerging markets power and infrastructure private equity firm.

Bush. The chapter, titled \\"Foreign Assistance and the Revolution of Rigor\\", calls for data and evidence to drive U.S. foreign aid and provides a roadmap for improving and sustaining foreign assistance programs. Shah and Gerson also co-authored an op-ed in the Washington Post on Zika.  The Rockefeller Foundation  On January 5, 2017, the Board of Trustees announced the unanimous selection of Shah to serve as the Thirteenth President of The Rockefeller Foundation. He assumed office on March 1, 2017, succeeding Dr. Judith Rodin who had served as president for nearly twelve years. Shah is the first-ever Indian-American to serve as president of the foundation.  Awards and recognition  Shah has been the recipient of numerous awards including the Secretary of State's Distinguished Service Award (2013); the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award, the highest official honor for non-resident Indian, awarded by the President of India (2011); the U.S. Global Leadership Council Tribute Award (2014); the Gene White Lifetime Achievement Award for Child Nutrition (2014); the Young Global Leader, World Economic Forum (2007); and recipient of the Deans Medal, Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University (2014) Shah has been awarded numerous honorary degrees including American University, Doctor of International Affairs (2012), Tuskegee University, Doctor of Science (2012), and Colby College, Doctor of Laws (2011).

Developed with help from General Motors engineer John Beltz, the Hurst Hairy Olds was built to be a showcase for the then-new chain-driven automatic transaxle of the 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado as well as a rival to the Hurst Hemi Under Glass. There were doubts in the automotive press as to the strength of such a system; the Hairy Olds was designed to dispel these doubts. The car debuted at a meet in Bakersfield, California on March 4, 1966. Driven by Joe Schubeck, the Hurst Hairy Olds began as a fully trimmed and later upholstered Oldsmobile 442 in body in white (BIW) form. Hurst installed not one but two 425 in¬≥ (7 L) Oldsmobile engines and Toronado transaxles both front and rear; a pair of drag parachutes were mounted in the stock taillight positions and four-wheel disc brakes were fitted as well. Two engines meant two of virtually everything in the cockpit related to the operation of the car, including two cable-operated shifters, two tachometers, two sets of oil pressure and temperature gauges and even two accelerator pedals. Additional power was provided via a Cragar Equipment-modified 6-71 GMC supercharger atop each engine, each burning a blend of nitromethane and alcohol. Weight was reduced through the use of aluminum body components and Plexiglas windows. The result was a 2400-horsepower, four-wheel-drive exhibition drag racer which smoked its front and rear tires down the length of the race track with times in the eleven- second range. Although the drive chains held up admirably, the car was not without its problems. The tremendous amount of power at the front wheels caused massive torque steer, resulting in difficulty in keeping the car in a straight line. The rear engine contributed to unloading of the front wheels, which in turn caused the front engine to overspeed. Visibility was poor as well due to tire smoke from both ends of the car. This coupled with engine oil spray out of the valve cover breathers because of the pressure of the superchargers. A second Hurst Hairy Olds was built in 1967, but was wrecked during an exhibition race in Niagara, New York. The 1967 car was the subject of one of the most popular model kits of the 1960s, a 1/24 version produced by Monogram.http://hursthairyolds.com/default.aspx Official Hurst Hairy Olds website The 1966 car presently resides at the R.E.

FI-RV Investors most commonly exploit interest-rate anomalies in the large, liquid markets of North America, Europe and the Pacific Rim. The financial instruments traded include government bonds, interest rate swaps and futures contracts.  Investment Strategy  Most FI-RV Investors focus on large, long-term mispricings in the global fixed-income markets, capturing relative- value anomalies via multi-product trades. Trades of interest include: Yield Curve Trade LIBOR yield curve using combinations of futures and swaps of varying maturities. Bond vs Bond Identify and trade bonds that are mispriced compared to other very similar bonds. LIBOR vs Bond Take advantage of anomalies in the spread between Bond and Libor Curves. Frequently, these above described anomalies occur when market participants are forced to make non-economic decisions due to accounting regulations, book clean-up, public furor or exuberance over a certain product, or sheer panic. The FI-RV Investor aims to capitalize on these and other inefficiencies. When a mispricing is identified between products, FI-RV Investors have the freedom to wait until the anomaly corrects. In contrast, other market participants, such as bank proprietary desks, are often limited by balance sheet considerations and accounting standards which influence the size and timing of their trades. However, the irony of Long-Term Capital Management's failure is that they were correct on all of their trades and hedges. They just did not have the excess collateral to meet the margin calls after the Russian financial crisis hit in 1998. In an Opalesque.TV interview, fund manager Bob Treue, who started a hedge fund specifically to capitalize on the opportunities left over by LTCM's failure, says that excess collateral is the key to the survival of a fixed-income relative-value strategy, and that this is the primary reason LTCM failed. He also says that LTCM's failure has had an enormous impact on the public perception of the fixed-income relative-value space, possibly an irreversible impact, with investors fearing the strategy is too risky.  Relative value  =Classic arbitrage= In times when there are dramatic flows into or out of a specific asset, there can be disparate pricings on products that are, for all economic purposes, identical. The FI-RV Investor can capture these inefficiencies by combining bonds, swaps, options, currencies and/or futures into products that replicate another product in every sense. One example of this occurred in late 1998. The Euro had been defined as .6242 Deutsche Marks, 1.332 French francs, .08784 British pounds, 151.8 Italian Lira, .2198 Dutch Guilder, 3.431 Belgian Franc, 6.885 Spanish Peseta, .1976 Danish Krone, .00855 Irish Punt, 1.44 Greek Drachma and 1.393 Portuguese Escudo. On December 31, 1998, the Euro would officially become a currency and these exchange rates would become irrevocable and trading Deutschemarks for Euros would be like exchanging nickels for dimes. Yet, leading up to this conversion, the demand for Euros was so incredibly high that one could buy all of the constituent currencies of the Euro for 98.25% of the value of the Euro and then sell the Euro itself for its full value. This was caused when corporates, governments and banks had decided that after January 1, 1999, the majority of their electronic billing and transfers would be done in Euros. So naturally, these entities (who aren‚Äôt interested in buying 11 currencies in hopes of exchanging them later) went out and started buying Euros in anticipation of European Monetary Union. The flows from this were dominant and pushed the value of the now favored Euro out of line with its parts. =Yield curve anomalies= At various times, yield curves will be hit by a wave of purchases or sales in a specific area of the curve. This will cause that area to form a 'trough' or 'hump' to it. By exploiting this odd shape through receiving the high rates around 'hump' and paying the low rates within the trough, The FI-RV Investor hopes to profit by waiting until the yield curve normalizes. An example of this type of distortion occurred in late 1994 and early 1995 when Alan Greenspan raised the US Fed Funds rate from 3.00% in May 1994 to 5.25% in February 1995. Prior to these hikes, Orange County had initiated highly leveraged bets on short maturity interest rate derivative products in the hopes that interest rates would decline. As short maturity rates moved higher as a result of continued action on the part of the US central bank, market participants, including Orange County, were forced to exit out of their short end positions. The leveraged nature of Orange County's positions and its imminent bankruptcy forced them to continue to dump risk at a time when the financial markets were unwilling to receive it. In addition to loss management and panic, a second powerful force drove traders out of the short end of the curve. At the time, Orange County was ridiculed by the press for their imprudence with the public's money. In fear that year end accounting would reveal that they held similar positions to the 'toxic waste' which poisoned Orange County, traders stampeded out of short end positions. =Credit spreads = The FI-RV also seeks to take advantage of periodic mispricings between LIBOR (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, essentially AAA and AA rated credit) and government credit. Since all of the major futures exchanges list both LIBOR (or the respective national equivalent) based contracts and government bond contracts, a fund such as The FI-RV Investor can take advantage of opportunities in this area of relative value as well. Frequently, as the credit concerns of either banks, governments or corporations comes into question, the spreads between these issuers moves quite substantially. In the fall/winter of 1998, Long Term Capital Management's Long term capital management takeover prompted rumors in the market that unwinds of their positions would be forthcoming. Hedge Funds would be forced to liquidate their long German Asset spreads (long German government credit against short bank credit in Deutschemarks) and their short Sterling Asset Spreads (short English government credit and long bank credit in British Pounds). At the time, the British Government had paused in its debt issuance and was running a small budget surplus, while the Germans had just elected a left leaning government and had large pension liabilities as well as a deficit in excess of 2% of GDP for 1998. Based on these fundamentals, the credit spread between government bonds and banks should have been larger in Britain than in Germany, but the crucial question was 'How much larger should the spread be?' The credit spreads for 5 yr. bonds started 1998 around 40 basis points in Britain and near 15 basis points in Germany. As news of problems in the Hedge Fund industry and potential credit unwinds began to permeate the market, the British spread exploded out to 140 basis points in October of '98 while the German spread managed only a meager move to 20 basis points. Although the British spreads deserved to be wider, they did not merit a 120 basis point premium over German Spreads. By November 1998, the premium had already contracted to 80 basis points. Global macro Market imbalances can cause fundamental, as well as relative, mispricings. These anomalies are more difficult to capitalize on since you must make assumptions as to where inflation, GDP, trade balance, etc. will be in the future. In addition, the fundamentals themselves are not tradable; you must employ market instruments as a proxy. While acknowledging the limiting nature of these assumptions, The FI-RV Investor will trade certain products that are mispriced from a fundamental prospective. For example, the 10 yr. bond contract in Japan had a yield of 0.70% as of early November 1998. This seemed inconsistent with long term expectations of the fundamentals. The Japanese Government was set to run the largest deficit in the history of the world (in absolute terms) and the Bank of Japan had said that they were going to target monetary growth rather than inflation. These policies would seem to create an enormous amount of new bond issuance and some future inflation due to the monetary growth. The variables which pushed yields to this low level could not last forever. The Japanese had been hurt in every investment they had made over the previous few years (Tokyo real estate prices were down 75% from their highs, the Nikkei had gone from 40,000 in January 1990 to 14,000 in November 1998 and the Yen had gone from 82 in April 1995 to 123 in November 1998, stopping at 145 along the way) and as a result, the Japanese had bought up bonds. The JGBs (Japanese Government Bonds) had given them nothing but gains and assurance of capital. It was no longer an issue of return on capital, but rather return of capital. With yields at this low level though, the market seemed to have made the assumption that a strong or even neutral economy would never return to Japan. By the spring of 1999, yields had risen to the 1.5-2.0% range from the 0.70% of early November 1998 =Volatility= Occasionally, The FI-RV Investor will trade volatility. In the hedge fund unwind panic of October 1998, equity volatility on the S&P; soared to around 40%. This unusual premium proved excessive and as of November 1998, these volatilities had returned to the high 20s. Also, sometimes volatility products will be used as a tool to implement the previously mentioned arbitrage strategies.

Tiller was killed during a Sunday morning service at his church, Reformation Lutheran Church, where he was serving as an usher. Tiller had previously survived an assassination attempt when Shelley Shannon shot him in the arms. Roeder was arrested within three hours of the shooting and charged with first-degree murder and related crimes two days later. In November 2009, Roeder publicly confessed to the killing, telling the Associated Press that he had shot Tiller because \\"preborn children's lives were in imminent danger.\\" Roeder was found guilty of first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault on January 29, 2010, and sentenced on April 1, 2010, to life imprisonment without any chance of parole for 50 years. Shooting and aftermath George Tiller was shot dead on May 31, 2009, during worship services at the Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, where he was serving as an usher. The church is a congregation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Tiller was shot in the head at point blank range; he was wearing body armor, as he had been since 1998, when the FBI told him he was being targeted by anti-abortion militants. After threatening two others who tried to prevent his departure, the gunman fled in a car. Witnesses described the vehicle as a powder-blue 1993 Ford Taurus. Calling the murder \\"an abhorrent act of violence\\", U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced, Wichita became the largest metropolitan area without an abortion provider. https://www.lifenews.com/2018/05/17/this-city-of-over-324000-people-is-the- largest-abortion-free-city-in-the-u-s/ That is until 2013, when Trust Women Foundation opened Trust Women Wichita.https://www.thedailybeast.com/in- wichita-the-ground-zero-of-the-abortion-war-a-new-clinic-rises Perpetrator The mug shot of Scott Roeder, jailed from July 11, 1997, to March 26, 1998, for violating parole on a 1996 conviction for having bomb components in his car trunk Scott Philip Roeder (born ) from Merriam, Kansas, was arrested in Gardner, Kansas, away in suburban Kansas City three hours after the shooting. He was charged on June 2, 2009, with first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault. Roeder was formally charged before a Sedgwick County district judge on June 2. He said very little during the hearing, where he asked for a public defender and did not enter a plea. Prosecutors said the killing did not meet Kansas's standards for capital murder, which would have carried a possible death penalty. Prior to the shooting, Roeder was not among the people monitored as potential threats by some abortion rights groups, including the state chapter of the National Organization for Women. It has been reported that neither the FBI nor local police arrested him in the days leading up to the murder despite reports and evidence offered to both that he vandalized a women's clinic the week before and the day before. In a telephone call to the press from prison, Roeder admitted that he had shot and killed Tiller, and declared that he felt no remorse. =Known employment and psychiatric histories= In the six months before Roeder's arrest, he said, he had worked for an airport shuttle service, a party-rental shop, a convenience store and a property management enterprise. After his arrest, Roeder's ex- wife, Lindsey Roeder, claimed that Roeder had been suffering from mental illness and that at about the age of 20 he was diagnosed with possible schizophrenia, but she offered her own diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Interview with Lindsey Roeder. Roeder claimed to be the father of a young child and asked for time for visitation, but the mother of that child did not wish such visitation. The 2005 Pennsylvania family court which ruled on Roeder's custody petition regarding a daughter born in 2002 took formal notice that Roeder had been diagnosed with possible schizophrenia and was not on medication. The Associated Press quoted Roeder's brother, David, who said that Scott had suffered from mental illness from time to time: =Anti-government activism= Roeder had been a member of the anti-government Montana Freemen group. He was stopped in Topeka, Kansas, in April 1996 while displaying a placard reading \\"Sovereign Citizen\\" in lieu of a license plate. He had no driver's license, vehicle registration or proof of insurance. Police officers searching his car discovered explosives charges, a fuse cord, a pound of gunpowder and nine-volt batteries in the trunk. He was charged, represented by a public defender, convicted in June of all four counts and sentenced to 24 months probation. In July 1997 his probation was revoked for failure to pay taxes and provide his social security number to his employer as well as other probation violations. He was sentenced to 16 months in prison to be followed by 24 months parole supervision. He filed notice of appeal and was represented by a state-funded appellate attorney who challenged the basis of the original search that found the bomb components. The Kansas Court of Appeals overturned this conviction in March 1998, ruling that the search of Roeder's car had been illegal and remanded the case to the trial court. Roeder was released after serving eight months.name = telegraphnews > Shawnee County Kansas court file Case number 96CR 01251 http://shawneecourt.org March 2, 1999 According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Roeder belonged to a group called the Sovereign Citizen Movement, which believes that virtually all existing government in the United States is illegitimate. The ADL's National Director Abraham Foxman stated that \\"Roeder's attachment to extreme causes extended beyond anti- abortion extremism. His extremism cross-pollinated between anti-government extremism and anti-abortion activism and led to violence and murder.\\" After being charged with murder, Roeder frequently called an Associated Press reporter from the county jail. He complained about being treated like a criminal and about his having been characterized in other media as having been anti-government. Roeder told the reporter, \\"I want people to stop and think: It is not anti-government, it is anti-corrupt-government.\\" =Lindsey Roeder statements= Lindsey and Scott Roeder were married in 1986, and were together for ten years. Immediately after his 2009 arrest, she stated that the explosives which led to his 1996 arrest had been intended for detonation at an abortion clinic. On June 2, 2009, Lindsey Roeder gave an interview to Anderson Cooper of CNN about when and why her husband became radicalized: =Anti- abortion militancy= David Leach, publisher of Prayer & Action News, a magazine that opines that the killing of abortion providers would be justifiable homicide, told reporters that he and Roeder had met once in the late 1990s and that Roeder at that time had authored contributions to Leach's publication. Leach published the Army of God manual, which advocates the killing of the providers of abortion and contains bomb-making instructions, in the January 1996 issue of his magazine. A Kansas acquaintance of Roeder's, Regina Dinwiddie, told a reporter after Tiller's murder (speaking of Roeder), \\"I know that he believed in justifiable homicide.\\" Dinwiddie, an anti-abortion militant featured in the 2000 HBO documentary Soldiers in the Army of God, added that she had observed Roeder in 1996 enter Kansas City Planned Parenthood's abortion clinic and ask to talk to the physician there; after staring at him for nearly a minute, Roeder said, \\"I've seen you now,\\" before turning and walking away. Roeder's former roommate of two years, Eddie Ebecher, who had met Roeder through the Freemen movement in the 1990s, told a reporter after Tiller's murder that he and Roeder had considered themselves members of the Army of God. Ebecher said Roeder was obsessed with Tiller and discussed killing him, but that Ebecher warned him not to do so. Ebecher, who went by the nom de guerre \\"Wolfgang Anacon,\\" added that he believed Roeder held \\"high moral convictions in order to carry out this act. I feel that Scott had a burden for all the children being murdered.\\" In 2007, someone who identified himself as Scott Roeder posted on the website of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue that, \\"Tiller is the concentration camp 'Mengele' of our day and needs to be stopped before he and those who protect him bring judgment upon our nation.\\" This was reported by the ADL's Center on Extremism, noting that Roeder called for \\"the closing of his death camp.\\" After Tiller's murder, officials from Operation Rescue, which had long opposed Tiller's abortion practices but denounced his shooting, said Roeder was not a contributor or member of the group. The cell phone number for Operation Rescue's senior policy advisor, convicted clinic bomb plotter Cheryl Sullenger, was found on the dashboard of Scott Roeder's car. At first, Sullenger denied any contact with Roeder, saying that her phone number is freely available online. Then, she revised her statements, indicating that Roeder's interest was in court hearings involving Tiller. Roeder reportedly attended the 2009 trial in which Tiller was acquitted of violating state abortion laws; Roeder called the trial \\"a sham\\" and felt the justice system failed in letting Tiller go free. On May 30, one day before Tiller was killed, a worker at a Kansas City clinic told the Federal Bureau of Investigation that Roeder had tried gluing the locks of the clinic shut, something Roeder was suspected of doing there before years earlier. The Kansas City Star reported that a man of Roeder's description had glued the locks shut at the Central Family Medicine clinic in Kansas City on May 23 and 30.  Reactions to Tiller's killing  A June 1, 2009, candlelight vigil in Boston, Massachusetts, for George Tiller President Barack Obama said, \\"I am shocked and outraged by the murder of Dr. George Tiller as he attended church services this morning. However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as abortion, they cannot be resolved by heinous acts of violence.\\" A number of other organizations also condemned the murder. Cardinal Justin Rigali of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops stated, Tony Perkins, President of the Family Research Council, condemned the killing, saying, The American Jewish Congress stated in a press release that Tiller's murder \\"exemplifies criminal anarchy, not legitimate protest. Dr. Tiller's murder was not just a terrible crime against an individual. It was also a crime against our democracy... Murder is not a debating technique. It is never, and must never be, an accepted way of advancing a point of view.\\"Statement of the American Jewish Congress Killing of Dr. George Tiller \\"Criminal Anarchy\\" and a Crime Against Democracy , American Jewish Congress, Press Release, June 1, 2009. The National Council of Jewish Women also condemned the murder, with President Nancy Ratzan stating that \\"Dr. Tiller devoted his life to ensuring that women did indeed have choices when confronted with an unintended or untenable pregnancy. His murder ‚Äì his assassination ‚Äì is intended to terrorize not only all involved with providing abortions but anyone even remotely associated with abortion rights.\\" The Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism also condemned Tiller's murder. Other reactions included: *David N. O'Steen, director the National Right to Life Committee released this statement on May 31, 2009: *Operation Rescue released this statement on May 31, 2009: *Mary Kay Culp, director of Kansans for Life, said that the organization \\"deplores the murder of Dr. George Tiller, and we wish to express our deep and sincere sympathy to his family and friends. We value life, completely deplore violence, and are shocked and very upset by what happened in Wichita today.\\" *Randall Terry, the founder of Operation Rescue, condemned the victim rather than the murderer: *Wiley Drake, vice-presidential candidate for the America's Independent Party ticket in 2008 and the second vice president of the Southern Baptist Convention in 2006‚Äì2007, asked on his radio show, \\"Would you have rejoiced when Adolf Hitler died during the war? ... I would have said, 'Amen! Praise the Lord! Hallelujah! I'm glad he's dead.' This man, George Tiller, was far greater in his atrocities than Adolf Hitler, so I am happy; I am glad that he is dead.\\" *Anti-abortion militants The Army of God, a group that promotes \\"leaderless resistance\\" as its organizing principle,As of 2009, The Army of God's webpage hosts a reprint of an article entitled \\"Leaderless Resistance\\" from a publication called The Seditionist. See http://www.armyofgod.com/LeaderlessResistance.htm issued a statement calling Tiller's presumed killer an \\"American hero.\\" Donald Spitz from that group stated, ‚ÄúI believe what he (Scott Roeder) did was justified manslaughter to save those unborn children from the baby murderer Dr. Tiller‚Äù. *Pointing out what he saw as a philosophical problem with \\"non-violent\\" right-to-lifism, Reason columnist Jacob Sullum wrote \\"if you honestly believe abortion is the murder of helpless children, it's hard to see why using deadly force against those who carry it out is immoral, especially since the government refuses to act.\\" William Saletan, Jacob Appel, Colby Cosh, and Damon Linker similarly questioned the pro-life movement's consistency in condemning Tiller's murder. Some commentators argued that the treatment of the murder, by both the White House and the media, was absurdly disproportionate. The day after the murder, two soldiers were attacked at an Army recruiting center in Little Rock, Arkansas: one died; the other suffered injuries. Comparing this incident with the Tiller murder, Michelle Malkin wrote, > Tiller's suspected murderer, Scott Roeder, was white, Christian, anti- > government, and anti-abortion. The gunman in the military recruiting center > attack, Abdul Hakim Mujahid Muhammad, was black, a Muslim convert, anti- > military, and anti-American. Both crimes are despicable, cowardly acts of > domestic terrorism. But the disparate treatment of the two brutal cases by > both the White House and the media is striking. James Taranto of The Wall Street Journal found fault with this view, claiming that its proponents failed to acknowledge that the crimes were different in nature and, therefore, in public import. Although equally \\"abhorrent\\", > in the hierarchy of public significance, assassinations rank higher than > hate crimes, which in turn rank higher than \\"ordinary\\" murders. The murder > of Martin Luther King was bigger news, and is a more important part of > history, than any individual lynching, even though both were atrocious > crimes spurred by similar ideological motives. Taranto also felt that the President's sentiments on the cases could be read quite differently: although his condemnation of the Tiller killing was worded far more strongly, it was only to the soldiers and their kin that condolences and sympathy were proffered, in spite of the fact that Tiller's wife was present at her husband's death.Obama's statement on the Arkansas attack read thus: \\"I am deeply saddened by this senseless act of violence against two brave young soldiers who were doing their part to strengthen our armed forces and keep our country safe. I would like to wish Quinton Ezeagwula a speedy recovery, and to offer my condolences and prayers to William Long's family as they mourn the loss of their son.\\" \\"If anything\\", Taranto opined, the statement was somewhat \\"cowardly\\", and the pains to which he went to appease the pro-life school were duly noted.\\"Two Murders, Two Statements\\" Another response to Malkin's charge of \\"disparate treatment of the two brutal cases\\" has been that the true disparity was the mass media's downplaying of Roeder's Christianity. In this view, major media outlets \\"relegate Mr. Roeder's religious motivation to the margins, while all play up Mr. Muhammad's connections to Islam.\\" Fox News Channel commentator Bill O'Reilly has also been accused of demonizing Tiller. O'Reilly was found to have mentioned Tiller by name on The O'Reilly Factor, his show on the Fox News Channel, 42 separate times prior to Tiller's death, referring to him specifically as a \\"baby killer\\" in 24 instances. The Weekly Standard blogger John McCormack has argued that there is no evidence to show that O'Reilly condones vigilantism, Former MSNBC anchor Cenk Uygur has argued that O'Reilly is directly responsible for Tiller's death. O'Reilly himself denied responsibility and defended his campaign against Tiller, saying: > When I heard about Tiller's murder, I knew pro-abortion zealots and Fox News > haters would attempt to blame us for the crime, and that's exactly what has > happened. [...] Every single thing we said about Tiller was true, and my > analysis was based on those facts. [...] Now, it's clear that the far left > is exploiting ‚Äî exploiting ‚Äî the death of the doctor. Those vicious > individuals want to stifle any criticism of people like Tiller. That ‚Äî and > hating Fox News ‚Äî is the real agenda here. In 2009, Congressman Keith Ellison said, \\"There is no room in America to 'justify' murder in the name of ideological differences. I condemn the act committed against Dr. Tiller as well as those who take comfort from his death.\\" On June 9, U.S. Representative Louise Slaughter sponsored a House resolution condemning the murder of Tiller, which was unanimously passed. Several pro-life groups claimed to have received death threats in the aftermath of the shooting, some of them threatening \\"vengeance\\" against the pro-life movement. Although most anti-abortion activists avoided Tiller's funeral, 17 members from the Westboro Baptist Church picketed the funeral. The church members held signs that read \\"God sent the shooter\\", \\"Abortion is bloody murder\\", and \\"Baby Killer in Hell\\". Trial of Scott Roeder On June 2, 2009, the District Attorney of the 18th Judicial District of the State of Kansas filed charges on behalf of the State of Kansas against Scott Roeder consisting of one count first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault. A preliminary hearing was held in Wichita on July 28, 2009. Judge Warren Wilbert ruled on January 8, 2010, that he would allow Roeder's defense team to argue for a voluntary manslaughter conviction, which in Kansas is defined as killing with \\"an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances existed that justified deadly force.\\" Jury selection was scheduled to begin Monday, January 11, 2010, but was delayed after prosecutors challenged the judge's decision to allow the defense to build a case for a lesser charge. Selection proceedings began in closed session on January 12, 2010. Judge Wilbert had ordered jury selection closed to the public and press citing fears jurors would be less than truthful if questioned in public. The Kansas State Supreme Court overturned his order, although parts of the questions to individual jurors remained private. The court heard opening statements on January 22, 2010. The defense had asked the court to hear the testimony of the former Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline and Barry Disney, a current member of that office. Both had previously tried to convict Tiller of providing illegal late-term abortions. The judge, upon previewing the testimony of Kline, disallowed his testimony pointing out such abortions are legal in Kansas and citing the possibility of prejudicing the jury. Scott Roeder took the stand in his own defense on January 28, 2010. At the outset, he admitted to killing Tiller, defending his act as an attempt to save unborn children and giving his views on abortion. Under questioning by his attorney, he attempted to describe abortion practices in detail but was repeatedly halted by objections based on his lack of medical expertise. Following Roeder's testimony on the stand, Judge Wilbert ruled that the jury would not have the voluntary manslaughter option. On January 29, 2010, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all three charges after less than 40 minutes of deliberation. Roeder's attorneys appealed the conviction, arguing that the jury should have been given the voluntary manslaughter option. The Kansas Supreme Court heard the appeal on January 29, 2014, and rejected it, upholding Roeder's conviction, on October 24, 2014. On April 1, 2010, in Wichita, Kansas, Sedgwick County District Judge Warren Wilbert sentenced Roeder to a \\"Hard 50\\", meaning life in prison with no possibility of parole for 50 years, for the murder of Tiller, the maximum sentence available in Kansas, plus an additional two years for the two counts of aggravated assault. Since then, the U.S. Supreme Court has altered the rules regarding when mandatory minimum sentences such as the \\"Hard 50\\" may be imposed, and on October 24, 2014, the Kansas Supreme Court called for re-sentencing. According to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision, the \\"hard 50\\" can still be imposed, but the finding that the circumstances of the crime justify the sentence must be made by a jury, rather than by the judge. On November 23, 2016, Roeder was re-sentenced to life in prison but now eligible to apply for parole after serving 25 years rather than after 50 years. As before, besides the sentence for murder, Roeder was also sentenced to two additional years for aggravated assault because he had threatened to shoot two church ushers while fleeing the murder. Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett said that prosecutors made the decision not to convene a new jury or ask for the reinstatement of the \\"hard 50\\", because of Roeder's age, his worsening health, and the likelihood that he will die in prison before the 25 years pass. The prosecutors also consulted Tiller's family, who said that they were comfortable with the reduction. =Further threats from prison= In 2013, Roeder was placed in solitary confinement for 45 days for issuing further threats of violence during a telephone interview with anti-abortion activist David Leach. He referenced the work of Julie Burkhart, Founder and CEO of Trust Women Foundation to open an abortion providing facility in Wichita. Cultural references Tiller's murder inspired an episode of the television legal drama Law & Order entitled \\"Dignity\\". In that episode, an anti-abortion activist murdered a doctor who performed late-term abortions in New York. The defense said it was a justifiable homicide, since the murderer did it in order to prevent the doctor from performing a late-term abortion upon a specific woman, hence, he did it in defense of another human being. In the end, the jury decided that the defendant was guilty of murder in the first degree. The episode's reception was polarized: the pro-life blogosphere appreciated the episode's handling of the abortion issue as a whole, while many pro-choice sources condemned the episode. The aftermath of Tiller's death is also the subject of the 2013 documentary After Tiller, which follows the lives of four other late-term abortion providers after Tiller's murder. The assassination of Tiller was mentioned in pro-life movie Unplanned (2019). Memorials to Tiller The George Tiller Memorial Abortion Fund was established by the National Network of Abortion Funds.

In 2009 and 2012, the Avonworth Middle School was named a School to Watch by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform. The recognition goes to schools that are: academically excellent by challenging all students, are sensitive to the unique developmental challenges of early adolescence and are democratic and fair, providing every student with high-quality teachers, resources, and supports. Schools must apply for this recognition.National Forum, Schools to Watch website, Accessed June 7, 2010 Elementary school Avonworth Elementary School is located at 1320 Roosevelt Road, Pittsburgh. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2010, the school reported an enrollment of 704 pupils in grades kindergarten through 5th, with 60 pupils receiving a federal free or reduced-price lunch due to family poverty.

In math, 89% of the students in 3rd through 6th grades were on grade level and 63% scored advanced. In 4th grade science, 92% of the pupils were on grade level. Special education In December 2010, the district administration reported that 110 pupils or 7.6% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 50% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the Administration reported that 156 pupils or 11.1% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. Avonworth School District has agreements with Glade Run Lutheran Services and the Allegheny Intermediate Unit #3 for special education services.Avonworth School Board, Meeting Minutes, June 1, 2010 In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have less than 10% supported through special education services, like Avonworth School District. Avonworth School District received a $679,188 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12 and 2012‚Äì13 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010‚Äì11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 93 or 6.83% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget In 2011, the average teacher salary in Avonworth School District was $58,179.61 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers receive was $16,277.69 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $74,457.30. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation, including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2007, the district employed 85 teachers with the average teacher salary in the district at $53,238 for 180 days worked.Fenton, Jacob, Average classroom teacher salary in Allegheny County, 2006‚Äì07.

The district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the income level. =State basic education funding= In 2011‚Äì12, the district will receive $2,347,240 in state Basic Education Funding.

The PostGazette.com. June 21, 2009. Governor Edward Rendell proposed a consolidation of Pennsylvania's 500 school district to 100 with adjacent school districts, in each county. He suggested that the administrative cost savings be redirected to improving lagging reading, math and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes.Pennsylvania Public School Enrollments by Local Education Agency, January 2009 A study of Pennsylvania public school spending, conducted by Standard and Poor's, found that consolidation of the administration with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings for people in both communities.Study of the cost-effectiveness of consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, Standard and Poor's School Evaluation Services, 2007. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts have enrollment below 1250 students, in 2007.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Study of the Cost Effectiveness of Consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, 2007.

A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010‚Äì2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010‚Äì11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.

According to a state report, for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Avonworth School Board applied for an exception (pension obligations) to exceed the Act 1 index for the 2010-11 budget. The Board did not apply for any exceptions in 2009‚Äì10. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.Scarcella, Frank and Pursell, Tricia, Local school tax assessments exceed state averages.

Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äì Division of Food and Nutrition.

This method provides a way to better understand and/or clearly communicate a concept or topic. SEE-I also lends itself to a natural descriptive style of writing where important concepts or topics are described in a clear, repetitive manner. This same method is sometimes referred to as the ‚ÄúC-I paradigm‚Äù.Paul and Elder (2005) SEE-I was originated by Richard Paul and Linda Elder and further refined into the current form by Gerald Nosich.  Overview  SEE-I has the following four steps: : 1. State the concept or idea in a single sentence or two. ::*Clearly and succinctly state the concept. : 2. Elaborate on the concept in your own words. Explain it at greater length in a paragraph or two. ::*Clarify the concept in your own words. \\"In other words,. . .\\" : 3. Exemplify the concept by giving concrete examples (and counter examples) of the concept. ::*Specify the concept by giving specific examples. \\"For example, . . .\\" : 4. Illustrate the concept with a picture, diagram, metaphor, or analogy. ::*Draw something, find an existing picture, or create a picture-in- words, such as with a metaphor or analogy. \\"It's like ...\\" As a process, SEE-I starts with a clear statement of the concept, followed by clarification in the person's own words. Next, the person goes to the specific with examples and counter examples of the concept. Finally, the person ends with a generalization of the concept, typically in the form of a metaphor or analogy. This illustration often represents a mapping to a more common domain of knowledge and helps the reader fully latch onto the concept. As the person works his or her way through the steps, previous steps often require revision. So the process as a whole is iterative, refining, and self-correcting, if explicit revision is employed. SEE-I is also an amenable method for small groups. A handful of individuals can work through the process to better understand the given concept and create a clear description for others.  Examples  SEE the concept \\"learning\\". :State ::* Learning is the gaining of knowledge, understanding, or ability. :Elaborate ::* In other words, learning is a process by which a person gains specific knowledge, understanding of this knowledge, or a specific skill (ability). Often learning involves gaining all three to varying degrees. The process occurs through a stressful repetitive perception that allows the underlying neural networks of the mind and body to adapt to the repetitive input. True learning involves internalization of the knowledge being learned. When I have learned something, I can not only say it back, I can also explain it, use it, and integrate it with my other knowledge. :Exemplify ::* For example, a child slowly learns to ride a bike by being guided, by practicing, and occasionally by falling down. ::* A counter example is someone that continues to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. :Illustrate ::* Learning is like a sponge that absorbs whatever liquid it comes in contact with, but hopefully never gets saturated. ::* Learning is like eating: what we eat becomes part of us. SEE the concept \\"cellular metabolism\\". :State ::* Cellular metabolism is the set of chemical reactions inside a cell that maintain life. :Elaborate ::* Cellular metabolism is the set of chemical reactions representing the flow of matter and energy through the cell. These chemical reactions maintain homeostasis, allow growth, and keep a relatively constant level of entropy in the cell. :Exemplify ::* The citric acid cycle is a part of cellular metabolism. ::* Cellular respiration is another part of cellular metabolism. ::* A counter example is the production of humus in the soil. :Illustration ::* Cellular metabolism is like the activity of the bees in a beehive. The worker bees, drones, and queen perform their separate tasks that together maintain a hive and enable it to grow. SEE the concept \\"diffusion\\". :State ::* Diffusion is the dispersal or spreading out of something like matter, energy, or even ideas. :Elaborate ::* In other words, diffusion is a time-dependent delocalization of a collection of entities typically via a random (stochastic) process. :Exemplify ::* For example, when someone puts a drop of food coloring in a cup of water, the molecule(s), providing the color, spread out in the water via Brownian motion until an equilibrium concentration is reached. :Illustrate ::* Diffusion is like my roommate's clothes that disperse from his drawers across our dorm room between his quarterly laundry runs.

The San Pedro y San Pablo College colonial church and school complex built in late 16th and early 17th centuries, located in the historical center of Mexico City district of Mexico City, Mexico. Today the church section of the complex houses the Museum of the Constitutions of Mexico‚àíMuseo de las Constituciones. The former school section of the complex stretches along San Ildefonso Street to Republica de Venezuela Street. History Church's 1920s ceiling fresco by Xavier Guerrero. San Pedro y San Pablo College was the second college founded by Jesuits in the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The Jesuit missionaries were sent to the new colony in the 16th century for Jesuit Reductions version of Indian Reductions, and to found new missions and schools. The missionary group that founded the college was led by Father Pedro Sanchez. and the official founding occurred in 1574 with the name of Colegio M√°ximo de San Pedro y San Pablo (Great College of Saints Peter and Paul). It was called \\"M√°ximo\\" because it was built to oversee the training of priests in Mexico City, Tepotzotlan, Puebla, Guadalajara, Zacatecas, Guatemala and M√©rida. Construction of the facility began in 1576, funded by Don Alonso de Villaseca and others. The college's church, on the corner of El Carmen and San Ildefonso, was built by Jesuit architect Diego Lopez de Arbaizo between 1576 and 1603. The church annex was completed in 1603 by Diego Lopez de Albaize, and the rest of the college complex was finished in 1645. The purpose of the college was to provide university-level education to young Criollo men, at least partially descended from white European colonial settlers. It was divided into the Lesser Schools, which taught humanities and Greek/Latin grammar, and the Superior Schools, which focused on theology, the arts and philosophy. The institution educated young men for both religious and secular vocations. It reached its peak during the first half of the 18th century when it had about 800 students enrolled; two of its more notable alumni are Francisco Javier Alegre and Francisco Javier Clavijero, After the expulsion of the Jesuits from colonial Mexico in 1767, the college closed. The school building was given to civil authorities, who first used it as a barracks and later to house the Nacional Monte de Piedad \\"credit union\\" charity foundation. The church was transferred to Augustinians, who removed most of the church's decoration. The altarpieces, paintings, and other decorative objects were redistributed to other churches, especially to the Metropolitan Tabernacle of the Mexico City Cathedral, where many of these pieces still remain. During this time, the complex began to seriously deteriorate. =19th century= When the Jesuits received permission to return to colonial Mexico, fifty years later in 1816, they found the complex nearly in ruins. They worked to rebuild both the church and the school, with much of the physical reconstruction done by Crist√≥bal Rodr√≠guez. However, San Pedro y San Pablo College never returned to its function, mostly due to the concurrent Mexican War of Independence against Spain. Shortly after Mexican independence was first declared in 1821, several important events occurred in the church building. In 1823, after proclaiming the independence of Mexico, Agust√≠n de Iturbide held meetings here which led to the promulgation of the \\"Reglamento Provisional del Imperio\\" (Provisional Regulations of the Empire). In the following year, the initial sessions of the Constituent Congress were held here, which wrote the first Federal Constitution of Mexico in 1824. After Iturbide's short reign as emperor, Guadalupe Victoria was sworn in as the first president of Mexico here. The church reopened for worship from 1832 to 1850, but then closed to become the library of San Gregorio College. During this time, the Virgin of Loreto image of Mexico City was here from 1832 to 1850 when it was thought that the Nuestra Se√±ora de Loreto Church it belonged to might collapse. Later, the space had quite a number of uses such as a dance hall, an army depot and barracks, a correctional school called Mamelucos, a mental hospital, and a storage facility for Customs. =20th century= From 1921 to 1927, the building was remodeled by Jos√© Vasconcelos and inaugurated as a \\"Hall of Discussion\\" with an office dedicated to a campaign against illiteracy. Vasconcelos had the church building redecorated, adding a number of important early modern mural works by artists such as Xavier Guerrero and Roberto Montenegro. From 1927 to 1930, the building was converted to workshops for the Academy of San Carlos, which had become integrated with the re-established National University (now UNAM). The Escuela Popular Nocturna de M√∫sica (School of Popular Evening Music) also occupied part of the building. In this way, the complex became part of University property, which it remains. In the early 1930s the university made it part of the National Preparatory School, and shortly after that it was also used as a secondary school, a School of Theater, an exhibition hall, and other uses. In 1944, the church part was inaugurated by President √Åvila Camacho as the National Periodical Archive (Hemeroteca Nacional), which it remained until 1979. In 1996 the Museum of Light was established by UNAM, with a gallery in the building. Building Stained glass window with seal of former Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico. =Church= The facade of the church section of the college was built in the Spanish Baroque and Neoclassical styles. It has a portal that is flanked by two pairs of Doric pilasters, which extend up to frame a window which is stained-glass in the design of the coat-of-arms of UNAM. Above the window is a triangular pediment which has a niche containing a statue of Athena. The portal is topped with a large curved pediment with a small crest bearing the coat-of-arms of Spain. The bell tower of the church is situated on the northwest side, behind the main fa√ßade. The inside of the church is in the form of a cross, with thick interior buttresses that marked off space for the church's various chapels. These buttresses extend upwards to support a handkerchief-vaulted ceiling. These interior arches have been painted with rustic-style flora and fauna created by Roberto Montenegro, Jorge Enciso, Gabriel Fern√°ndez Ledesma, and Rafael Reyes Espindola. Another feature of the church is its three stained glass window pieces. Two of these were designed by Roberto Montenegro and called La Vendedora de Pericos (The Parakeet Seller), and the other is called El Jarabe Tapatio (The Jarabe Dance of Guadalajara). The stained glass window with the seal of the University visible on the church's facade was designed by Jorge Enciso. All of these designs were then crafted by Eduardo Villase√±or. =School= The school buildings that housed the college, except for a facade with the seal of the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico, are nearly devoid of decoration. This part of complex originally had four courtyard patios, but two were demolished to make way for Republica de Venezuela Street. In one of the remaining patios, there is an obelisk that records the three institutions of learning that have been housed at the site. Today, this part of the building is dedicated to a number of uses, one of which is being the home of Secondary School #6. Mural titled The Tree of Life by Roberto Montenegro (1920s). =Decorative elements= The original Spanish colonial decorative elements of the interiors no longer remain. Murals and decorative painted walls, part of the Mexican government‚Äôs renowned 1920s Mexican Muralism project for public buildings, were commissioned by Jos√© Vasconcelos. The decorative paintings of rustic-style flora and fauna on the buttresses and arches, several wall murals and frescos, and Montenegro's stained glass windows, remain from that period and are conserved. Interior murals In the presbytery of the church, Roberto Montenegro painted a mural titled The Tree of Life, also often referred to as the Tree of Science. It is the first mural painted in modern Mexico. Mexican Museums and Mavens Blog: \\"Mexico‚Äôs New Constitution Museum: Trying to Make Sense of a Complex Legislative Trail\\"; posted 11 November 2011; images and English text  accessed 6 November 2014. It was restored in 2010, as part of the renovations for the new Museum of the Constitutions of Mexico. Xavier Guerrero decorated the presbytery's dome in the 1920s, with paintings that were inspired by the zodiac. Cloister murals The walls of the cloister arcade had paintings by Dr. Atl and Robert Montenegro, but the works have been lost. The most important was titled The Festival of the Cross, which was painted in the stairwell of the east patio. In the stairway at the northwest corner of the cloister's patio, there is a fresco done by Roberto Montenegro in 1923, titled The Festival of the Holy Cross. It is said to have been done in a style to imitate fellow muralist Diego Rivera. Later in the 1920s, an allegory of the Mexican Revolution titled The Iconographic Museum of the Revolution was begun in the cloister by Gabriel Fern√°ndez Ledesma, but was not finished. Museums =Museum of Light= The Museum of Light (Museo de la Luz), a part of UNAM‚àíUniversidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico, had exhibition space in San Pedro y San Pablo College from 1996 to 2010. It is a science museum dedicated to the phenomena of light and a contemporary art gallery for works of light art. The San Pedro y San Pablo College building was closed in 2010, in order to convert it into the Museum of the Constitutions. The Museum of Light moved out, and is now located in the colonial era San Ildefonso College building, also in the historic center of Mexico City. =Museum of the Constitutions of Mexico= The Museum of the Constitutions of Mexico (Museo de las Constituciones), also part of UNAM, opened in 1911 in the former presbytery space of San Pedro y San Pablo.Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico.mx: Museum of Light (Museo de las Constituciones)DEMOTIX Blog: \\"UNAM inaugurates Museum of the Constitutions of Mexico - Mexico City; posted 9 August 2011, by Luis Ramon Barron Tinajero; accessed 6 November 2014.

It is approximately long.Calculated in Google Earth Course The Niawiakum River originates in the hills of the southwestern part of Washington. It flows generally west, emptying into Willapa Bay near Bay Center and the mouth of the Palix River. The river's entire length is only a few miles. The lower half of the Niawiakum River is a broad estuary and tidal marshland. U.S. Route 101 crosses the river near its mouth. History The name \\"Niawiakum\\" derives from the Lower Chehalis name for the river. Natural history of the lower river is a protected land preserve called the Niawiakum River Natural Area Preserve, yet most of the land is controlled by Weyerhaeuser which has resulted in significant clearcut logging and damage to the forest and river ecosystems. Two of the largest Western Red Cedar trees in the world, the Niawiakum Giant and the Seal Slough Cedar, sit on Weyerhaeuser land, however, surrounding clearcuts have nearly killed the Seal Slough Cedar. The river estuary and its tidal salt marsh vegetation is among the highest quality of the entire Washington and Oregon coasts. There are ongoing efforts to protect more of the Niawiakum estuary along with the nearby Bone River estuary.

History and recording Between 1965 and 1967, the Charlatans were an influential, but commercially unsuccessful, folk rock and blues band that have been widely credited by critics as having started the Haight-Ashbury psychedelic scene in San Francisco. In 1969, the band signed a recording contract with Philips Records, although their lineup had changed considerably from their 1965 ‚Äì 1967 heyday. The version of the band that recorded The Charlatans consisted of original members Mike Wilhelm (lead guitar, vocals) and Richard Olsen (bass), with Terry Wilson (drums) and Darrell DeVore (piano/keyboards, vocals) having been recruited in order to flesh out the band, prior to the recording of the album. The Charlatans was recorded at Pacific High Studios, San Francisco, with production and engineering by Dan Healy and the band. Reception The Charlatans was a critical and commercial flop upon its release. Although the record was the Charlatans' debut album, it was recorded and released relatively late in the band's career, a factor which critic Richie Unterberger has suggested contributed to its commercial failure. Critics have also suggested that a contributing factor to the album's lack of success was the fact that the band's sound had become somewhat outdated by 1969, with their brand of jug band blues and gentle psychedelia being largely eschewed by the public in favor of a heavier rock sound. In his book, The Summer of Love: The Inside Story of LSD, Rock & Roll, Free Love and High Times in the Wild West, author Joel Selvin describes the album as \\"an unenthusiastic coda to a misspent career.\\" Other reviewers have been kinder towards the album, with critic Bruce Eder noting that the album \\"is a rather gorgeous and gently challenging piece of San Francisco rock, incorporating elements of blues and big-band swing, as well as '50s rock & roll and elegant '60s pop.\\" A single taken from the album, coupling the Van Dyke Parks-penned song, \\"High Coin\\", with \\"When I Go Sailin' By\\", was released by Philips Records in 1969, but this too was a commercial failure. Disillusioned by the album's lack of success, the Charlatans had broken up by the end of 1969. Reissues The Charlatans has been reissued on CD three times to date. Firstly, in 1992 by Eva Records as an unofficial (or bootleg) CD, where it was coupled with another unofficial Charlatans' album, a compilation of unreleased recordings titled Alabama Bound. The second reissue was on One Way Records in 1995 and included two bonus tracks, \\"The Shadow Knows\\" and \\"32-20\\", both of which had been released on the Charlatans' debut single in 1966. The third reissue of the album was released under the title San Francisco 1969 by Acadia Records in 2004 and was digitally remastered from the original master tapes.

The poem was the first work of his to be printed in a major publication. Background While Coleridge attended Jesus College, Cambridge, he began to contract debt and was soon overwhelmed by the amount that he owed. With his debts, he decided to travel to London during November 1793 and purchased an Irish Lottery ticket during that time. The occasion prompted him to write the poem To Fortune, on Buying a Ticket in the Irish Lottery, which was published by the Morning Chronicle on 7 November 1793;Ashton 1997 p. 40 this was his first printed work. He returned to Cambridge, after buying the lottery ticket, in order to fulfill obligations to meet with some of his schoolmates; he was part of a literary society created by himself along with his friend Charles Le Grice. They first met on 5 November and discussed literature and poetry. On the 13th, he read some of his poems to his fellows.Chainey 1995 pp. 112‚Äì113 After a week, he returned to London and began despair to the point that he contemplate suicide. During this time, he stayed in a place that Coleridge was to deem of ill-repute.Sisman 2007 qtd. p. 45 Of this series of going back and forth between London and Cambridge, he told his brother: > When I returned to Cambridge a multitude of petty Embarrassments buzzed > round me, like a Nest of Hornets ... My agitations were delirium ‚Äî I formed > a Party, dashed to London at eleven o'clock at night, and for three days > lived in all the tempest of Pleasure ‚Äî resolved on my return ‚Äî but I will > not shock your religious feelings ‚Äî I again return to Cambridge ‚Äî staid a > week ‚Äî such a week! Where Vice has not annihilated Sensibility, there is > little need of a Hell! On Sunday night I packed up a few things, ‚Äî went off > in the mail ‚Äî staid about a week in a strange way, still looking forwards > with a kind of recklessness to the dernier resort of misery...Chainey 1995 > qtd p. 113 The drawing started 12 November 1793 with a conclusion on 28 November; Coleridge did not win any money, and he began resenting gambling and the lottery system more and more as time went on. Without money and still despairing, Coleridge allowed himself to be pressed into enlistment with the Royal Dragoons in early December 1793.Mays 2001 pp. 112‚Äì113 Poem The poem reflects on Coleridge's feelings of despair during November 1793 and combines these feelings with those that arise from unrequited love: The poem ends on a note of hope: Themes The poem incorporates aspects of Coleridge's feelings of despair, especially about his debt. During this time of despair, he was able to compose poems and managed to become published for the first time. To Lottery, in particular, incorporates a discussion of his debts but also combines it with the effects of unrequited love. The poem serves as a release for his emotional feelings, feelings that date back years and not just those regarding events of 1793.Holmes 1989 p. 52 The images within To Fortune could also be bits of parody. John Strachan points out in 2007 that \\"'To Fortune' gently sends up the stock phrases of a musing and pensive poetic sensibility [...] The poem, with its stale personification [...] trite condemnation of luxury in the eighteenth-century manner [...] and attitudinising invocation [...] is a poem of some literary significance, a parodic composition made from the conventions of what Wordsworth later labelled 'poetic diction'\\".Strachan 2007 p. 188 In terms of Coleridge's feelings on the lottery system, he began to oppose the idea of a lottery after writing To Fortune. He would later argue that the lottery should be abolished in his Lay Sermon. The abolition of the lottery would prove that the government was able to make society morally correct and serve as a symbol in that regard.Colmer 1959 p. 139 Also, he criticized the notion of a lottery in his The Friend, describing it as \\"that other opprobrium of the Nation, that Mother vice\\".Gregory 2003 qtd. p. 71 In 1826, he wrote to James Gillman about the end of the lottery. In particular, he reflected on the actions of Thomas Bish and stated, \\"I do not undervalue Wealth, even if by descent or by Lottery [though] since Mr Bish mourns in large Capitals, red, blue, and black, in every corner over the Last, the downright Last, you have but small chance, I suspect, of a snug ¬£30,000 from this later source\\".Strachan 2007 qtd. p. 188‚Äì189 Notes References * Ashton, Rosemary.

A native of Schenectady, New York, Supronowicz was 6 foot, 1 inch, and 180 pounds. He played high school basketball for Mt. Pleasant High School. As a senior in 1946, he scored 20 points in a 53-29 victory over Manlius Military Academy. He enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1946 and was a four-year starter for the school's basketball team. As a freshman in 1947, Supronowicz was selected as the Wolverines' most valuable player and ranked as one of the leading scorers in the Big Nine Conference. His outstanding performance in his freshman year led a New York newspaper to write the following: > \\"Mack Supronowicz of Schenectady, freshman sensation at the University of > Michigan. In his first season of Big Nine play, Supronowicz, one of the > finest basketball players developed by Sig Makofski at Mount Pleasant, > scored 163 points in 12 games (of which Michigan won only six) and won wide > acclaim as the greatest cage prospect in college history.

Twenty-two of his points came in the second half.\\" Despite being hampered by a concussion for much of the 1948 season, he was chosen as the outstanding basketball player in the Big Nine Conference as a sophomore. He also led Michigan to the NCAA tournament in 1948. In the consolation game against Columbia, Michigan began the second half with a ten- point surge, including three plays in which Supronowicz dribbled down the floor for easy layups, as Michigan defeated Columbia 66-49 at Madison Square Garden. In February 1949, he set a Michigan single-game scoring record with 28 points in a 64-53 win over Purdue. Earlier that month, Supronowicz also had a 23-point game, including 11 free throws, in a 54-47 win over defending conference champion, Indiana.

He was incarcerated for 46 years, longer than any other prisoner in New York State history. Rosenberg was sentenced to death for his involvement in a double homicide of two New York City police officers. His sentence was commuted to life in prison to be consistent with laws reducing the use of capital punishment in New York. Rosenberg went on to become the first New York State inmate to earn a law degree and in turn gave legal advice to several inmates, including the leaders of the Attica Prison riot. A book was written about Rosenberg and his time in prison which was adapted into a made-for-TV movie. Robbery and murder In 1962, Rosenberg took part in the robbery of Borough Park Tobacco Company in Brooklyn. The robbery was unsuccessful and resulted in the death of two police officers. The previous killing of two New York City police officers had occurred more than three decades earlier. With 1,000 police officers assigned to the double homicide, Rosenberg would eventually turn himself in. Upon conviction of first-degree murder, Rosenberg was to be executed along with his accomplice in the 1962 shooting. Throughout his sentence, Rosenberg claimed to have not been guilty of murder. Time in prison In 1964 Rosenberg was to be executed using the electric chair. Shortly before it was to take place, he was granted a stay of execution by Governor Nelson Rockefeller based on new laws that reduced the use of capital punishment in New York. Four years after Rosenberg's incarceration, he earned a law degree from the Blackstone Career Institute. Prior to Rosenberg, no inmate in the state of New York had ever earned a law degree. During the 1971 Attica Prison riot, Rosenberg provided legal advice to those leading the uprising. This included dramatically tearing in half a judge's order, as TV news cameras rolled, because he considered it a fake. In actuality, the authentic order had been procured as a bargaining chip‚Äîto protect Attica's inmates from future administrative reprisals if they would return to their cells. Rosenberg was shot in the knee and beaten during the riot, He acted as one of the negotiators for the prisoners before the insurrection ended with an all-out assault by police. After the riot's resolution, Rosenberg was transferred to Sing Sing Correctional Facility. He frequently assisted other prisoners with legal issues as a jailhouse lawyer and estimated he was involved in over 200 lawsuits. Rosenberg was transferred to Wende Correctional Facility in 1991, serving, among other positions within the prison, as paralegal assistant for three years in the law library. Rosenberg was transferred to prison hospital in 2000. He died of natural causes in June 2009 at the age of 72, having served 46 years in state prisons, the longest of any inmate in New York State penal history. In media Rosenberg was the subject of a 1982 biography by Stephen Bello called Doing Life: The Extraordinary Saga of America's Greatest Jailhouse Lawyer; in 1986, the book was adapted for an NBC made-for-TV movie called Doing Life with Tony Danza in the role of Rosenberg.

Prior to having the name Bear Creek Springs, the area had a post office called Francis. It is unknown why that name was used. In the years before the Civil War, a community existed in the area due to clean water and a great deal of game. It also served as a stopping place for settlers to camp as they headed west. Bear Creek Springs was once an incorporated town. However, as the city of Harrison developed and better transportation options became available, residents and businesses left. Bear Creek Springs is now an unincorporated community with a small handful of businesses remaining along what is now US 65.

The community was named after John Self, a first settler. Urban Legend Self is Home to the Urban legend of the Gow-Row. The legend is as follows: ‚ÄùNear the village is the Devil's Hole Cave, a strange and unexplored cavern. One day, an indeterminate number of years ago, the owner of the land where the cave is located decided to check out the place. He climbed down a rope about 200 feet to a ledge where the shaft narrows to a point that can only be crawled through. He suddenly heard a vicious hissing from the darkness, perhaps like a large lizard would do, and he made a hasty retreat. Some time later, he and some men from town dropped a flatiron tied to a rope to the same place in the cave. They heard a hissing sound and the rope was pulled hard. When they pulled it back up, they found the flatiron had been badly bent and scored with scratches and teeth marks. They next tried a stone and the rope was pulled taut again. They pulled it back up and the stone was gone. No one wanted to dare and climb down to see what was in the cave. Occasionally, local stories apparently come from the cave, but the \\"gow-row\\" as the natives supposedly call it, seems to prefer staying down in the darkness. The story dates back to around 1900 and many believe the monster may be some sort of giant lizard.‚Äù The legend of the Gow-Row has been specific to Boone County, Arkansas, with most reports of the cave being near or within Self's borders.

The airfield was opened in September 1940 and was closed in 1948, during this time it was mainly used an relief landing ground (RLG) and small planes such as the Westland Lysander and the Taylorcraft Auster. After the Second World War had ended the airfield was used by two Royal Air Force (RAF) gliding schools. History The airfield was first constructed in 1935 in conjunction with a country club opening up at Firbeck Hall. Cyril Nicholson invested money into the Jacobean hall and its surroundings which attracted the rich and glamorous of that time. The then Prince of Wales (the future Edward VIII) also flew into the airfield in his own Dragon rapide aircraft (the very aircraft that he flew to London on his accession to king in 1936). On the outbreak of war, the airfield was pressed into service for the Royal Air Force under the Emergency Powers Act. The first squadron to use the airfield was No. 613 Squadron RAF which had moved from RAF Netherthorpe on 7 September 1940. The unit had detachments at various other airfields such as RAF Clifton, RAF Netherthorpe, RAF Sutton Bridge, RAF Doncaster and RAF Martlesham Heath initially flying the Westland Lysander Mk. II before the addition of the Mk. III in January 1941. The squadron moved to RAF Doncaster on 8 July 1941. A short time after this on 19 July 1941 No. 2 Squadron RAF moved in from RAF Sawbridgeworth flying the Lysander II for four days before moving back to Sawbridgeworth. Between July 1941 and 1 November 1945 Firbeck was used as a relief landing ground for No. 25 Elementary Flying Training School RAF (EFTS). The next squadrons are both Air Observation Post squadron which were used by RAF Army Cooperation Command to help spot enemy positions. The first of these squadron was No. 654 Squadron RAF which started using RAF Firbeck from 15 September 1942 flying the Taylorcraft Auster Plus C2 and the Auster I before moving to RAF Bottisham on 20 November 1942 and the second was No. 659 Squadron RAF which was formed at the airfield on 30 April 1943 and flew the Auster III before moving to RAF Clifton on 17 August 1943. In 1944 No. 28 Gliding School RAF took up residence with Cadet gliders staying until January 1946. However after a short amount of time No. 24 Gliding School RAF took over the empty space in May 1946 and they stayed until February 1948. The airfield closed during 1948.

Bryan is located about west of Green River along the Blacks Fork River, and for a short time was the local headquarters and division point of the Union Pacific Railroad. Today, only a few concrete foundations remain.  History  Union Pacific advertisement promoting connections out of Bryan, Wyoming As with other cities in Wyoming, squatters rushed to occupy land in Green River City, in anticipation of the arrival of the transcontinental railroad, in 1868. Unwilling to negotiate with the squatters, the railroad instead laid out a new town to the west of Green River, along the Blacks Fork River, and established it as the local headquarters of the railroad. Stage service was established between Bryan and Green River and from there connecting to mines and towns throughout Wyoming. Once passed over for the headquarters, the population in Green River dropped rapidly. Several years later, Blacks Fork dried up due to a drought and the railroad was concerned that there was not enough water in Bryan to service the locomotives. The railroad was able to acquire enough land to move the headquarters to Green River and completely abandoned Bryan. Green River thrived, but Bryan's population plummeted and never recovered.

Migration history Afghan refugees began flowing into the Netherlands in the late 1980s, fleeing violence in their homeland. In the decade up to 2002, the Netherlands was the second-most popular destination in Europe for Afghan asylum-seekers, behind Germany; they made up more than 20% of the total of roughly 170,000 applications for asylum filed by Afghans in Europe. The Dutch government settled them in a variety of areas with the policy aim of preventing the formation of large immigrant communities in the cities. As a result of the increasing inflow of asylum-seekers, the Dutch government set up a war crimes investigation unit in the late 1990s; the first refugees they charged with war crimes were Heshamuddin Hesam and Habibulla Jalalzoy, both former members of the Afghan intelligence service KHAD during the 1980s Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. Their presence, when it became known, evoked a great deal of unrest and fear among the Netherlands' Afghan community. Charged with abusing prisoners in a 2005 trial, they received sentences of 12 and 9 years in prison, respectively. In 2003, the Netherlands signed a voluntary repatriation agreement with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the transitional government of Afghanistan, recognising the right of Afghan refugees in the Netherlands to return to Afghanistan and establishing procedures. However, by 2007, only 800 had returned; most refugees feel that public safety, women's rights, and educational conditions in Afghanistan are insufficient. Young people who choose to return may also encounter language difficulties, as they exhibit language shift towards Dutch and away from Dari. Demographic characteristics , statistics of the Dutch Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek to people of Afghan origin showed: *31,823 persons of first- generation background (17,238 men, 14,585 women) *8,241 persons of second- generation background (4,244 men, 3,997 women), of which: **361 persons with one parent born in the Netherlands (185 men, 176 women) **7,880 persons with both parents born outside the Netherlands (4,059 men, 3,821 women) For a total of 40,064 persons (21,482 men, 18,582 women). This represented more than eight times the 1996 total of 4,916 persons. The proportion of persons of second- generation background increased from 7.7% to 21% over the same period; the rest of the growth was due to immigration. 2010 was the first year since 2003 that population growth by immigration exceeded population growth by natural increase.; the year 1996 is earliest for which data is available online As with other migrant ethnic groups, their age structure is skewed towards young people--90% are younger than 45, a similar proportion to Turkish, Iranian, and Somali migrants, but much higher than the equivalent figure of 60% in the native Dutch population. Integration and community Afghan migrants to the Netherlands have founded roughly 130 different associations, mostly aimed at maintaining Afghan culture in the Netherlands and providing charitable assistance--especially materials like blankets, food, and furniture--to people and non-governmental organisations in Afghanistan. Afghans form a relatively heterogeneous group both socially and ethnically, with representation of speakers of various languages of Afghanistan and representatives of various political factions in Afghanistan ranging from communists to democrats and Islamic activists; within organisations, most prefer to work with people of a similar background. Health issues Stress-related illnesses are common among migrants of Afghan background, due to a variety of causes including war, separation from relatives, and uncertainty about their future due to economic and residency permission issues. Differences in the health care systems of Afghanistan and the Netherlands have proven confusing to some refugees. The general practitioner plays a far more important role in the Dutch system. In contrast, in the Afghan system, patients often bypass their family doctor--or in rural areas, village herbalist--to consult specialists in urban areas directly. Mistrust of Dutch doctors is common, possibly stemming from Afghans migrants' general feeling of social exclusion.

Its last assignment was to the 478th Fighter Group at Portland Army Air Base, Oregon, where it was disbanded on 31 March 1944. During World War II the squadron served as a Bell P-39 Airacobra replacement training unit. History The squadron was first activated in late 1943 as the 546th Fighter Squadron (Twin Engine) at Hamilton Field, California. It was one of the four original squadrons of the 478th Fighter Group, which drew its original cadre from the 328th Fighter Group.Abstract, History 478 Fighter Group Dec 1943-Mar 1944 Retrieved December 11, 2013 The squadron moved twice in the first two months of its existence, to Santa Rosa Army Air Field in December 1943, then to Madras Army Air Field in February 1944 as its parent group dispersed its component squadrons to separate bases in California, Oregon, and Washington.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 569, 648-649 The group and squadron experienced delays and were not fully manned or equipped until March 1944, when they began operations as a Replacement Training Unit (RTU) using single engine Bell P-39 Airacobras despite their designation as a two engine units. RTUs were oversized units whose mission was to train individual pilots or aircrews prior to their deployment to combat theaters. However, the Army Air Forces found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit,Craven & Cate, The Organization and its Responsibilities, Chapter 2 The AAF, p. 75 while the groups and squadrons acting as RTUs were disbanded or inactivated.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 7 The squadron moved to Portland Army Air Base in late March 1944, where it was replaced, along with other units at Portland, by the 432d AAF Base Unit (Fighter Replacement Training Unit, Single Engine), which absorbed its mission, personnel and equipment.

There were also allegations in the discrepancy of age in his election affidavit and his university website. After becoming a minister of information and broadcasting, there were allegations that he was trying to float a TV channel and an English newspaper, both of which were not established. =Multifold increase in personal wealth= As per official declaration, his assets has increased from 5 Crore in 2009 to 70 crores in 2011. This is the highest percentage rise for property among all ministers in the central cabinet. Jagathrakshakan is the founder of Chennai-based Accord Group with interests in Hospitality, Pharmaceuticals, Liquor Manufacturing, and Education.In education space, he owns various colleges under the trust Bharath Institute of Higher Education and Research (BIHER). =Capitation fee sting operation= In a sting operation conducted by Times of India in June 2009, it was exposed that one the medical colleges founded by him collected 20 lakh rupees for MBBS admission in violation of Supreme Court order and State legislation. =Coal mining scam allegations= In September 2012, several news reports alleged that his family is a part of a company named JR Power Gen Pvt Ltd which was awarded a coal block in Orissa in 2007. It was the same company which formed a joint venture with a public sector company, Puducherry Industrial Promotion Development and Investment Corporation (PIPDIC), on 17 January 2007. Barely five days after, PIPDIC was allotted a coal block. According to the MoU, JR Power enjoyed a stake in this allotment. However, JR Power had no expertise in thermal power, iron and steel, or cement, the key sectors for consumption of coal. Later, in 2010, JR Power sold 51% stake to KSK Energy Ventures, an established player with interests in the energy sector. The rights for the use of the coal block thus passed to KSK. Reacting to this, Jagathrakshakan admitted to getting a coal block, and said that, \\"It is true that we got a coal allocation but it was a sub-contract with Puducherry government and then we gave it away to KSK company. Now, we have got nothing to do with the allocation but if the government wants to take back the allocation it can do so.\\" =Foreign Direct Investment in Sri Lanka= In March 2019, Sri Lanka's BOI (Board of Investment) made an announcement regarding the $3.85 billion plan to build an oil refinery in Hambantota. The investor was reported as Silver Park International PTE Ltd registered in Singapore, which has as its Directors Jegath Rakshagan Sundeep Anand, Jagathrakshakan Sri Nisha and Jagathrakshakan Anusuya - the son, daughter and wife of Jagathrakshakan Swamikannu. It was also reported that Jagathrakshakan Swamikannu was a Director of the company from June 2017 to September 2018. Silver Park International Pte Ltd, is said to be investing 70% of the share capital ‚Äî a total of $1887 million ‚Äî in the project valued at a total of $3.85 billion. It was also reported that Jagathrakshakan along with his family was in Sri Lanka at the deal signing. This had led to news agencies calling for an explanation from the DMK on the source of funds, especially given Jagathrakshahan's chequered past. On 12 Sep 2020, Enforcement Directorate seized properties of Jagathrakshakan worth Rs.89.1 crores, due to violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act regulations, in relation to illegal acquisition, holding and transfer of foreign security in Silver Park International PTE Ltd.

Corn was determined to return bridge supremacy to America, after its domination for more than a decade by the formidable Italian Blue Team. The Aces, in various formations during the years featured stars such as James Jacoby, Bobby Wolff, Billy Eisenberg, Bobby Goldman, Mike Lawrence, Paul Soloway, Eric Murray and Sami Kehela. They won the 1970, 1977 and 1983 Bermuda Bowls, as well as several other competitions. The team slowly disbanded after Corn's death in 1982. History Corn recruited James Jacoby and Bobby Wolff, then Billy Eisenberg, Bobby Goldman, and Mike Lawrence, paying salaries ($800 per month for single players, $950 for married ones) plus expenses for major tournaments. Bob Hamman at first declined an invitation, but became the sixth team member in 1969. Jacoby paired with Wolff, Eisenberg with Goldman, and Lawrence with Hamman. The team practiced and analyzed hands for long hours. Corn hired coaches and provided a computer from one of his companies to assist analysis and to generate bridge s to order. In 1969, the team achieved its first major success, winning the Spingold Knockout Teams at the fall North American Bridge Championships. That year it represented North America in the Bermuda Bowl tournament, the nearly- annual world championship. But the Aces placed third behind a team from Taiwan‚Äîan astonishing upset and the first time that a Bermuda Bowl final match did not include North America or the United States. Meanwhile, the Blue Team won its tenth in a row, and then disbanded. The Aces beat Taiwan in the 1970 final and defended their title in 1971, beating France in the final. After 1971, Corn paid only expenses, no salaries. The composition of the team began changing. In 1971, Eisenberg departed, replaced by Paul Soloway until 1973, when he in turn was replaced by Mark Blumenthal. That year the Aces as defenders lost the Bermuda Bowl final to Italy, with three players from the later Blue Teams on its roster. Lawrence and Jacoby were the next to leave, making way for the Canadian pair of Eric Murray and Sami Kehela. They lost two more Bermuda Bowl finals, in 1974 and 1975, to Italy, which fielded three and two Blue Team members. Other personnel changes followed. The Aces recaptured the Bermuda Bowl in 1977 with the pairs Eisenberg‚ÄìEddie Kantar, Hamman‚ÄìWolff, and Soloway‚ÄìJohn Swanson (same as 1975). As \\"USA\\" in the 1980 World Team Olympiad, the Aces played well and won the silver medal. Corn, who would die of a heart attack in April 1982, assembled one final Aces team in 1981. Now comprising Mike Becker‚ÄìRon Rubin and Alan Sontag‚ÄìPeter Weichsel with Hamman‚ÄìWolff, it went on to win the 1982 Spingold and the 1983 Bermuda Bowl.

It is about long.Calculated in Google Earth Course The Bone River originates in the hills of the southwestern part of Washington, close to the source of the North Fork Palix River. It flows generally west, emptying into Willapa Bay near Bay Center just north of the Niawiakum River. The river's entire length is only a few miles. Most of the Bone River is marshy. It empties into an estuary and tidal marshland on Willapa Bay. U.S. Route 101 crosses the river near its mouth. History A smallpox epidemic swept through the Pacific Northwest in 1853. One of the first documented cases occurred at the mouth of the Bone River. A homesteader named James Swan witnessed the disease breaking out among the Chinook Indians after several ships had wrecked off the mouth of the nearby Columbia River. Swan's is the only first-hand account of the epidemic among the Chinook. Within a year the Chinookan population had been reduced by perhaps half and the disease had spread far up the Columbia River, all along the coasts of Washington and Oregon, to Vancouver Island, the Skagit River and the Nooksack River. Natural history Part of the river's drainage basin is a protected land preserve called the Bone River Natural Area Preserve. Totaling , the preserve contains the finest salt marsh remaining in Willapa Bay and is a critically important waterfowl habitat. There are ongoing efforts to protect more of the Bone River along with the nearby Niawiakum River estuary.

This part of the south side of Loch Assynt has been fenced off to assist natural regeneration of the tree cover. So far, there are few trees showing, despite the OS mapping showing this as a wooded area. Assisted natural regeneration (ANR) is the human protection and preservation of natural tree seedlings in forested areas. Seedlings are, in particular, protected from undergrowth and extremely flammable plants such as Imperata grass. In addition to protection efforts, new trees are planted when needed or wanted (enrichment planting). With ANR, forests grow faster than they would naturally, resulting in a significant contribution to carbon sequestration efforts. It also serves as a cheaper alternative to reforestation due to decreased nursery needs. ANR is labor-intensive and requires nearly constant maintenance of selected forest areas. can be effective as a community project, and people involved may see significant benefits and jobs if funding is available. However, if the forestation is not a positive change, for example if the land is needed for food, the people of the community will be unlikely to get involved and produce successful ANR. The most effective way to implement ANR is very site-specific, and many nations provide guidebooks on how to select and maintain an ANR project. Source: Kathleen et al, 1999.  Current practice  According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), China has since 1999 funded extensive ANR in an effort to prevent soil corrosion in particular. Also the FAO reports that ANR is a common practice in Thailand. ANR is gaining popularity as global climate change becomes a growing concern.

It was discovered on 23 February 1999, by Canadian astronomer Denis Bergeron at the Val-des-Bois Observatory in Quebec, Canada. The asteroid was named for the three Canadian astronomers Christian Marois, Ren√© Doyon and David Lafreni√®re.  Orbit and classification  Madola is a non-family from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.5‚Äì3.6 AU once every 5 years and 3 months (1,912 days; semi-major axis of 3.02 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.18 and an inclination of 17¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken by Spacewatch in April 1994, almost 6 years prior to its official discovery observation at Val-des-Bois.  Physical characteristics  = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Madola measures 4.481 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.085. = Rotation period = As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of Madola has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.  Naming  This minor planet was named in honor of Canadian astronomers Christian Marois (born 1974), Ren√© Doyon (born 1963) and David Lafreni√®re (born 1978). They had developed instruments and techniques that allowed them to be the first to directly photograph an extrasolar planetary system, namely the first three planets orbiting the star HR 8799 in the constellation Pegasus. At the time of naming this asteroid, Ren√© Doyon was the director of the Canadian Mont M√©gantic Observatory, while Christian Marois and David Lafreni√®re were postdocs at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics and the University of Toronto.

Its principle of operation is based on the Franz-Keldysh effect, i.e., a change in the absorption spectrum caused by an applied electric field, which changes the bandgap energy (thus the photon energy of an absorption edge) but usually does not involve the excitation of carriers by the electric field. For modulators in telecommunications, small size and modulation voltages are desired. The EAM is candidate for use in external modulation links in telecommunications. These modulators can be realized using either bulk semiconductor materials or materials with multiple quantum dots or wells. Most EAMs are made in the form of a waveguide with electrodes for applying an electric field in a direction perpendicular to the modulated light beam. For achieving a high extinction ratio, one usually exploits the Quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) in a quantum well structure. Compared with an Electro-optic modulator (EOM), an EAM can operate with much lower voltages (a few volts instead of ten volts or more). They can be operated at very high speed; a modulation bandwidth of tens of gigahertz can be achieved, which makes these devices useful for optical fiber communication. A convenient feature is that an EAM can be integrated with distributed feedback laser diode on a single chip to form a data transmitter in the form of a photonic integrated circuit. Compared with direct modulation of the laser diode, a higher bandwidth and reduced chirp can be obtained. Semiconductor quantum well EAM is widely used to modulate near- infrared (NIR) radiation at frequencies below 0.1THz. Here, the NIR absorption of undoped quantum well was modulated by strong electric field with frequencies between 1.5 and 3.9 THz. The THz field coupled two excited states (excitons) of the quantum wells, as manifested by a new THz frequency-and power- dependent NIR absorption line. The THz field generated a coherent quantum superposition of an absorbing and a nonabsorbing exciton. This quantum coherence may yield new applications for quantum well modulators in optical communications. Recently, advances in crystal growth have triggered the study of self organized quantum dots. Since the EAM requires small size and low modulation voltages, possibility of obtaining quantum dots with enhanced electro-absorption coefficients makes them attractive for such application.

The museum houses around 4800 objects from the Kamakura region including sculptures, paintings and industrial art objects. Most of these works originate from the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, spanning from the 12th to the 16th century. Some of the items were produced in China and imported to Japan. Name The term \\"National Treasure\\" in the museum's name refers to \\"old\\" National Treasures of Japan, term which denoted all the state- designated Cultural Properties of Japan before the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties came into force on August 29, 1950. All of the old national treasures became Important Cultural Properties and some of them have been designated as (new) National Treasures since June 9, 1951. From a current perspective the name refers to a museum housing both Important Cultural Properties and National Treasures. History The Kamakura Museum of National Treasure was founded in April 1928 to protect important art works after the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake. The building, which was constructed in the same year, was modeled after the Sh≈çs≈çin treasure house of T≈çdai-ji, Nara. During World War II, in June 1945, part of the collection was evacuated to in Tsukui District in the northwestern part of Kamakura, and the museum was temporarily closed between August and October 1945. The items which had been moved returned in May 1946. In October 1952, the museum came under the jurisdiction of the newly established Kamakura City Board of Education. In November 1955 it joined the . The was established in the museum in October 1974. In 1983 the museum's annex storage room was completed, and in May 2000 the main building was designated as a Registered Tangible Cultural Property. Main Building The main building is a two-story reinforced concrete construction with tile- roofing and a building area of about 800„é°. There is no basement. The construction resembles the raised-floor-style of an ancient log storehouse. It was designed by , architect of the Kabuki-za theater and the Otaru branch of the Bank of Japan, and constructed by the Matsui Group (Êùæ‰∫ïÁµÑ, now Matsui Construction Co.: Êùæ‰∫ïÂª∫Ë®≠Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ). From the outside the building resembles Nara's Sh≈çs≈çin treasure house, while techniques from Kamakura period temples have been employed on the interior. The ground floor is used as storage, while the second floor contains a single exhibition hall spanning almost 600m¬≤. Annex The annex is connected to the main building via a walkway on the second floor. Like the main building it is a two-story reinforced concrete construction featuring two floors above ground and a basement, with rooms for repairs and machines. The ground floor contains offices and the room of the curator, while the second floor is used as storage space. Highlights of the Collection The Kamakura Museum houses five National Treasures of Japan, 73 items designated as \\"Important Cultural Property\\", and other works of art.

The match was played at the Adelaide Oval in Adelaide from 13 to 19 January 1933, with a rest day on 15 January. England won the match by 338 runs to take a series lead of 2 Tests to 1 with 2 Tests to play. The Test was noted as the one in which the controversy over the use of \\"bodyline\\" tactics by the English team came to a head. These tactics, employed by the England fast bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce on the direction of their captain, Douglas Jardine, engendered much ill-feeling. Background alt=A cricketer holding a bat. In 1932‚Äì33, the English team led by Douglas Jardine toured Australia and won the Ashes in a highly acrimonious series known as the \\"bodyline series\\". It has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history,Colman, p. 171. and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities.Haigh and Frith, foreword. The English team used controversial bowling tactics where the English fast bowlers Harold Larwood, Bill Voce and Bill Bowes bowled the cricket ball roughly on the line of leg stump. The deliveries were often short pitched, bouncing as high as the head and torso of the batsman, with four or five fielders close by on the leg side waiting to catch deflections off the bat. The tactics were difficult for batsmen to counter. The only options for a batsman were to duck, carrying the risk of being hit on pitches with irregular bounce, or to play the ball. However, defensive shots risked a catch in the cordon, while hooking carried the danger of being hit in the head at dangerous speeds.Haigh and Frith, p. 70.Piesse, p. 130. The bowling was designed to be intimidatory, causing controversy and ill- feeling among the Australian players and crowds.Douglas, p. 103. The primary target of bodyline was Donald Bradman who had overwhelmed the English bowling in the 1930 Ashes series. Generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time, Bradman had scored a world record 974 Test runs during that series, a feat which remains unsurpassed.Cashman, pp. 32‚Äì35. English cricket commentators feared that Bradman would be unstoppable on good Australian batting wickets in 1932‚Äì33 and looked for weaknesses.Frith, pp. 37‚Äì39. On the journey to Australia, Jardine discussed tactics with Larwood and other bowlers, and he may have met senior batsmen Wally Hammond and Herbert Sutcliffe. Some players reported that Jardine told them to hate the Australians to defeat them, while instructing them to refer to Bradman as \\"the little bastard.\\"Frith, pp. 61, 66. At this stage, he seems to have settled on leg theory, if not full bodyline, as his main tactic.Douglas, pp. 123‚Äì24. While Jardine's unfriendly approach and superior manner caused some friction with the press and spectators, the early tour matches were uncontroversial and Larwood and Voce had a light workload in preparation for the Test series.Frith, pp. 69, 90‚Äì91.Douglas, p.126. This changed in the match against an Australian XI where the bowlers first used bodyline tactics. Under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt, Jardine having rested from the match, the England attack bowled short and around leg stump, with fielders positioned close by on the leg side to catch any deflections. Wyatt later claimed that this was not pre-planned and he simply passed on to Jardine what happened after the match. The bodyline tactics continued in the next match and several players were hit.Frith, pp. 94, 102. The Australian press were shocked and criticised the hostility of Larwood in particular.Frith, pp. 97‚Äì98. Former players joined the criticism by saying that the tactics were ethically wrong. However, at this stage, not everyone was opposed.Frith, pp. 106‚Äì07. The Australian Board of Control believed the English bowlers had not bowled unfairly when Bradman expressed his concern to them.Frith, p. 99. Jardine increasingly came into disagreement with tour manager Plum Warner over bodyline as the tour progressed.Frith, p. 98. Warner opposed bodyline but would not speak out against it. However, he was accused of hypocrisy for not taking a stand on either side,Growden, pp. 62‚Äì63. particularly after expressing sentiments at the start of the tour that cricket \\"has become a synonym for all that is true and honest. To say 'that is not cricket' implies something underhand, something not in keeping with the best ideals ... all who love it as players, as officials or spectators must be careful lest anything they do should do it harm.\\"Frith, p. 68. Furthermore, he had criticised bowler Bill Bowes for using short-pitched bowling against Jack Hobbs in a match at the end of the 1932 season.Frith, pp. 49‚Äì50. =Earlier tests= Jardine's tactics were successful in one respect: in six innings against the tourists ahead of the Tests, Bradman had scored only 103 runs, causing concern among the Australian public who expected much more from him.Frith, p. 105. He missed the first Test, worn out by constant cricket and the ongoing argument.Frith, p. 109. Australia lost heavily by ten wickets as Larwood took ten wickets, as the English bowlers used bodyline intermittently, to the crowd's vocal displeasure.Frith, pp. 117, 120, 126, 134. The only Australian batsman to make an impact was Stan McCabe, who hooked and pulled everything aimed at his upper body,Colman, p. 172. undeterred by the prospect of taking a potentially lethal blow to the head. He scored 187 not out in four hours, an innings described by leading historian David Frith as \\"among the most stirring innings Test cricket has ever produced\\".Haigh and Frith, p. 71. Behind the scenes, administrators began to express concerns to each other. Yet the English tactics did not earn universal disapproval; former Australian captain Monty Noble praised the English bowling.Frith, pp. 134‚Äì35. For the second Test, Bradman returned to the team after his newspaper employers released him from his contract.Frith, p. 139. England continued to use bodyline tactics. Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings, bowled by Bowes. Jardine was observed to be so delighted that he clasped his hands above his head and performed a \\"war dance\\". This was an extremely unusual reaction in the 1930s, particularly from Jardine who rarely showed any emotion while playing cricket.Bowes, p. 107. However, in the second innings, against the full bodyline attack, Bradman scored an unbeaten century, his only one of the series, which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each.Piesse, p. 132.Frith, pp. 150, 159‚Äì63. The victory was met by widespread public jubilation, as many believed that Australia had found a means of overcoming the tactics. Critics began to believe bodyline was not quite the threat that had been perceived and Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. On the other hand, the pitch was slightly slower than was customary throughout the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness.Douglas, p. 137.Frith, p. 165. =Woodfull's approach= Meanwhile, Bill Woodfull's physical courage, stoic and dignified leadership won him many admirers. He refused to employ retaliatory tactics and did not publicly complain even though he and his men were repeatedly hit‚Äî according to Ken Piesse, 34 times in all.Piesse, p. 131. Woodfull, was being encouraged to retaliate to the short-pitched English attack. However, the Australian captain refused to consider doing so.Frith, p. 134. Before the Second Test in Melbourne, he had to wait until minutes before the game before he was confirmed as captain by the selectors, causing the toss to be delayed and leading to speculation that the Australian Board of Control wanted to remove Woodfull because of his refusal to allow his bowlers to retaliate.Haigh and Frith, p. 72. His deputy Victor Richardson advocated retaliation along with several other players.Colman, p. 181. Richardson recalled Woodfull's private response: \\"There is no way I will be influenced to adopt such tactics which bring such discredit to the game. I know Tim could do it but I am not going to participate in actions that can only hurt the game.\\" The media advocated the selection of Eddie Gilbert, an indigenous bowler of extreme pace, in order to return the bodyline barrage. In one tour match, Gilbert had bloodied Jardine and left a bruise the size of a saucer.Colman, pp. 172, 179. Another suggested means of retaliation was Laurie Nash,Whitington and Hele, p. 132. a footballer and paceman whose notoriously abrasive personality and aggression saw him regarded as a thug.Cashman, p. 221. However, Woodfull was totally unmoved by such suggestions.Colman, pp. 181‚Äì82. =Team selection= In the buildup to the third Test, Jardine banned spectators from watching his players at net practice after he had been barracked. The press were unable to watch and therefore give detailed previews before the match started.Frith, p. 170. The tourists' preparations were also hampered by stories in the press that Maurice Tate and Jardine had come to blows, which Tate later denied was true or even realistic.Frith, p. 171. There were questions over the form of Jardine, who had scored just 28 runs in his three innings in the series, Jardine suggested that he should stand down from the team. The rest of the tour selection committee, Wally Hammond, Bob Wyatt, Herbert Sutcliffe and Warner would not consider dropping the captain.Frith, p. 56.Jardine, p. 92. However, taking into account Jardine's nervousness before going in to bat, the senior players persuaded Jardine to open the batting with Sutcliffe.Frith, pp. 170, 173. Sutcliffe and Jardine had occasionally opened together on the 1928‚Äì29 tour with some success.Jardine, p. 94. The English selectors were concerned by the domination of the Australian spinners of Bill O'Reilly and Bert Ironmonger, who had reduced the tourists to strokelessness in the second Test. To counter this, Eddie Paynter was introduced into the side in the hope that his aggressive style and left-handed batting (in contrast to the rest of the batting line-up which was right-handed) would disrupt the Australian bowlers. He replaced the Nawab of Pataudi whose earlier successes, including a century on his Test match debut, were offset by his slow scoring. However, Pataudi's refusal to field close on the leg-side in the bodyline field setting, his friendliness with the opposition and the mutual antipathy between him and Jardine may also have contributed to the loss of his place.Frith, p. 173.Douglas, pp. 132, 148. England made one other change. Although Bowes had dismissed Bradman in the second Test, he took no other wickets; Jardine believed that the Adelaide pitch was not helpful to fast bowlers, while spinner Jack White had taken thirteen wickets in the equivalent match four years previously. Consequently, Hedley Verity replaced Bowes in the team.Jardine, pp. 92‚Äì93. Australia made just one change to the team which won the second Test. Leo O'Brien, who had scored 10 and 11 in that match, was relegated to twlefth man and Bill Ponsford returned to the side.Frith, pp. 182, 212. 13 January: Day One Jardine won the toss and chose to bat. Clem Hill remarked to Jardine that it should be a close game, but Jardine joked that he obviously had not seen who had won the toss. There had been rain on the day before the match and moisture was still present when Sutcliffe and Jardine went out to bat, which made the pitch difficult for batting that morning. Australia had played three spinners, so leg spinner O'Reilly took the new ball with the solitary paceman Tim Wall. The fourth ball, from Wall, bounced unexpectedly and hit Sutcliffe's shoulder, to the crowd's pleasure. After twenty minutes play, England had scored just four runs when Jardine was bowled off his pads trying to glance a swinging delivery from Wall. Hammond came in and looked uncomfortable as Wall bowled some short-pitched deliveries. He had to duck underneath one ball and departed after slashing wildly at a quick delivery and with the score at 16, he was caught by Wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield, standing further back than usual, diving across in front of first slip.Jardine, p. 95. Umpire George Hele believed Hammond may have deliberately got out. Jardine believed the ball had bounced lower than usual. As he walked off, disturbed by the frequency of short bowling, Hammond was heard to say \\"If that's what the bloody game's coming to, I've had enough of it.\\" A second wicket fell without a run added as Sutcliffe, after 46 minutes batting, played a weak shot and hit O'Reilly in the air. Wall, at short square leg, dived forward to take a one-handed catch.Frith, pp. 173‚Äì74. Les Ames, who was in poor batting form, also looked uncomfortable. He batted unconvincingly for 39 minutes for three runs and did not score for 20 minutes; in that time, he edged the ball several times and was bowled by a no-ball from O'Reilly. Just as it appeared he was settling down, he was bowled by a faster ball from left arm orthodox spinner Bert Ironmonger. England's score was four wickets for 30 runs (4/30).Jardine, p. 95.Frith, p. 174. The crowd were delighted by the course of the morning session; England had not expected to lose so many wickets so quickly and Hedley Verity and Gubby Allen, both due to bat lower in the order, were seen rushing to the dressing room to change in case they were needed to bat quickly. Maurice Leyland and Bob Wyatt took England to lunch without losing any more wickets and the score was 4/37 after 90 minutes play. Leyland and Wyatt began a recovery after the interval, batting beyond tea in putting on a 156-run partnership and turning the match back towards England. During this stand, the pitch settled down and became easy to bat on as the moisture in the pitch dried out.Whittington and Hele, p. 133. Leyland began with a hooked four from Wall and began advancing down the pitch to Clarrie Grimmett.Frith, p. 176. Jardine had told the pair to bat cautiously, but Wyatt hit three sixes, two off Grimmett; usually, he was a dour, defensive batsman. After the second six, Wyatt saw Jardine leave his seat on the pavilion balcony and return to the dressing room. The third six, a hook off the bowling of Wall, was nearly caught by Bradman at long leg.Frith, pp. 174‚Äì75.Douglas, p. 138. At one point during the stand, Leyland complained to the umpires that Ironmonger was using resin on the ball to increase his grip and allow him to spin the ball more. Ironmonger emptied his pocket to show there was nothing there, and Leyland apologised. However, Ironmonger seemed less effective after the challenge and umpire Hele remembered that Ironmonger emptied the wrong pocket and Leyland did not ask him to empty the other. Later in the day, Jardine sent out a message to the umpires pointing out that Richardson was changing his position behind the batsmen's backs.Frith, p. 175. Wall tried bowling leg theory against Wyatt, but without a packed legside field, but Wyatt hooked the ball over the fielders' heads. Leyland and Wyatt added 100 runs in 90 minutes and the tea interval was taken with the score 4/154. The only possibility of a wicket was when Bert Oldfield failed to stump Leyland off Grimmett's bowling when the batsman had scored around 30.Jardine, p. 96. After tea, O'Reilly bowled with five fielders on the leg side before dismissing Leyland when the batsman tried to hit a faster ball which bowled him via the bat and pad. Jardine wrote that \\"no praise can be too high for this exceedingly fine effort\\". He scored 83 from 190 balls in three hours. In all, he hit thirteen fours and his driving on the off-side was praised by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, while Wilfred Rhodes, writing in England, believed that Leyland ought to become Sutcliffe's regular opening partner. Wyatt was dismissed soon afterwards, hitting a poor shot to mid off where Richardson held the catch. He said later that he should have hit the ball for four instead of getting out. He had scored 78 in 164 minutes from 176 balls. Jardine believed it was the best innings Wyatt had played, showing a more adventurous approach than usual for Wyatt and praised his driving, as well as his more familiar cuts and hooks. Jardine wrote that it was \\"a truly excellent display at a critical time\\". Wisden noted that Leyland and Wyatt \\"if enjoying a certain amount of luck, batted, in the circumstances, uncommonly well\\". The score was 6/196 and the innings was in danger of collapse. Australia took the new ball with the score at 200. Eddie Paynter held the innings together until the close of play, scoring 25 runs, using good footwork to attack Grimmett. However, after twice cutting Stan McCabe for four, Gubby Allen was leg before wicket (lbw) to Grimmett for 15 at 7/228. England reached the close of play at 7/236 with Verity on five. Jardine praised the bowling of Wall on the first day, but noted that by the final session, he was too tired to be effective. 14 January: Day Two The second day's was watched by a record Adelaide Oval crowd of 50,962.Frith, p. 177. Before play began, Paynter had been shaken when, en route to the cricket ground, an assailant knocked him to the floor before running away. Nevertheless, he and Verity resumed their overnight partnership and batted until lunch. Paynter frequently stretched forward to smother the spin bowling of O'Reilly and was not troubled by Grimmett. He was able to score by hitting the ball into the covers, while Verity concentrated on defence apart from a drive through point off Ironmonger. Both men looked to take quick runs as the fielders moved in to gather the ball. The only dangers came when Paynter slipped and Fingleton missed a chance to run him out when his throw missed the stumps, and Verity edged the ball past O'Reilly, standing too close at slip, from the bowling of Ironmonger.Frith, p. 178. By the first interval of the day, the overnight batsmen had added 79 in the morning session, taking the total to 7/315. A short ball from Wall removed Paynter for 77 when the Lancastrian tried to pull and was caught behind square leg. He received an excellent reception from the crowd and had added 96 with Verity. Wall then bowled Voce, who moved too far across the pitch and left his leg stump exposed, and had Verity caught by Richardson after scoring 45 in two- and-a-half hours. The English innings ended at 341, a substantial recovery after the poor start. Wall had figures of five wickets for 72 (5/72), while O'Reilly had bowled 50 overs two wickets. Jardine was disappointed that Larwood and Voce did not extend the innings, conscious that England now faced a long session of fielding as tea was taken between the innings.Jardine, p. 97. Woodfull now opened Australia's batting with Jack Fingleton. Fingleton did not last long. Jardine believed that he, along with Richardson and McCabe, was showing an increasing mastery over bodyline. However, Jardine had noted that Fingleton had shown some uncertainty outside his off-stump against Gubby Allen during his innings of 83 at Melbourne. He now used Allen, bowling into the wind, to attack Fingleton. In Allen's second over, Fingleton was dismissed for a duck, touching a ball which was caught behind by Ames. Bradman now came to the middle, to an excellent reception.Jardine, p. 98. Meanwhile, Larwood was surprised to find that he was making the ball swing into Woodfull, instead of away from right-handers as he usually did.Douglas, p. 139. Larwood bowled the third over of the innings; the fifth ball narrowly missed Woodfull's head. The final ball was short and on the line of middle stump and struck Woodfull over the heart. The batsman dropped his bat and staggered away holding his chest and bent over in pain. The England players surrounded Woodfull to offer sympathy but the crowd began to protest noisily. Jardine called to Larwood: \\"Well bowled, Harold!\\" Although the comment was aimed at unnerving Bradman, Woodfull was appalled.Hamilton, p. 156.Frith, p. 179. Play was briefly delayed while Woodfull recovered and continued once it was certain he could carry on. Larwood's over had ended and Woodfull did not face the bowling of Allen in the next over. However, when Larwood was ready to bowl at Woodfull again, play was again halted. Subsequently, Jardine claimed that Larwood requested a field change, Larwood said that Jardine had done so. The fielders were moved into bodyline positions, causing the crowd to protest and call abuse at the England team, even more so than when Woodfull was hit.Whittington and Hele, p. 136. Many commentators condemned the alteration of the field as unsporting, and the spectators became extremely volatile from anger.Frith, p. 181. They viewed it as hitting a man when he was down.Haigh and Frith, p. 73.Piesse, p. 127. Mass hooting and jeering occurred after almost every ball. Some English players later expressed fears that a large-scale riot and that the police would not be able to stop the irate home crowd, who were worried that Woodfull or Bradman could be killed, from attacking them.Piesse, pp. 127‚Äì28. Jardine, although writing that Woodfull could have retired hurt if he was unfit, later expressed his regret at making the field change at that moment. It is likely that Jardine wished to press home his team's advantage in the match, while the bodyline field was usually employed at that stage of an innings.Frith, p. 180. Shortly afterwards, a delivery from Larwood knocked Woodfull's bat from his hands and the Australian captain seemed unsettled. Two quick wickets fell before Ponsford joined Woodfull in the middle, but having been struck by short balls several more times, Woodfull was bowled by Allen for 22, having batted for an hour and a half. Vic Richardson replaced him at the crease. When an injury to Voce required a request for a doctor, many in the crowd believed it was Woodfull who required assistance, leading to a renewal of protest.Frith, pp. 182‚Äì83. At the other end, Bradman was trying to defend stoutly with a straight bat over the ball, but with extra bounce, Larwood was causing the vertically-challenger Bradman difficulty. Bradman was unable to keep one defensive shot down and it flew to Allen at short leg. Bradman was out for eight and McCabe came in at 2/18. McCabe felt that there was too much bounce for vertical-bat defensive shots to be effective and he tried to counterattack like he had in Sydney. On this occasion, he mistimed a hook from Larwood and was caught by Jardine at midwicket for eight. Australia were 3/34 when Bill Ponsford came in to join his Victorian captain. Woodfull battled it out for 89 minutes, collecting more bruises before Allen bowled him for 22,Frith, p. 182. leaving the score at 4/51. Later in the day, the English team manager Pelham Warner visited the Australian dressing room to express his sympathies to Woodfull. Woodfull had remained calm in public, refusing to complain about Jardine's tactics. Woodfull's abrupt response was meant to be private, but it was leaked to the press and became the most famous quotation of this tumultuous period in cricket history: Woodfull reportedly added \\"This game is too good to be spoilt. It's time some people got out of it\\", hinting that he might withdraw his team from competition in protest. Australia's Leo O'Brien later reported that Warner was close to tears following Woodfull's rebuke. 16‚Äì19 January: Day Three to Day Six Ponsford was hit all over his back and shoulders because of his strategy of turning away and shielding his bat from the possibility of yielding a catch,Cashman, p. 243 and Australian wicketkeeper Bert Oldfield was struck a severe blow to the head while batting on the third day of the match, causing a fracture (although this was from a top edge off a traditional non-bodyline ball and Oldfield admitted it was his fault). While the crowd again showed their rage, Woodfull came onto the ground to help Oldfield back to the dressing room.Piesse, p. 128. As a result of the injuries, the costs of insurance cover for players doubled.Frith and Haigh, p. 77. During the fifth day's play the Australian Board of Control for International CricketFrith, pp. 216‚Äì18. sent the following cable to the MCC in London: Woodfull (left) walks out to open the batting with Vic Richardson in the final bodyline Test Jardine threatened to withdraw his team from the Fourth and Fifth Tests unless the Australian Board withdrew the accusation of unsporting behaviour.Haigh and Frith, p. 75. The MCC backed their captain but offered to abandon the tour.Piesse, p. 129.Haigh and Frith, p. 74. They asked the Australians to propose a law change if they disagreed with the tactics and blamed the batsmen for the injuries. The standoff was settled only when Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons warned the Australian Board of the severe economic hardships that could result if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the Fourth Test, thus saving the tour.Haigh and Frith, p. 76.Frith, pp. 255‚Äì59. In the meantime, the second innings in Adelaide saw England set Australia a near-impossible 532 for victory; even today, the highest successful Test run chase is 418. Australia lost its first wicket at three when Jack Fingleton was bowled by Larwood. Woodfull was joined by Bradman, who played in an unorthodox counterattacking method, before being dismissed for 66. Woodfull continued on to score an unbeaten 73, carrying his bat as his teammates capitulated around him. Australia was eventually all out for 193, with Oldfield unable to bat due to his fractured skull.Perry, pp. 144‚Äì46.

It usually contains an electromechanical gong and was used with most early desk stand telephones, such as candlestick telephones and the Western Electric type 102 and 202 telephones, which were too small to hold a ringer and other required electrical components. Many pay station telephones also used a separate ringer box. In telephony, ringer boxes and similar devices are often categorized as subscriber sets. The ringer contained in the ringer box alerts a call recipient to incoming calls by ringing one or more metallic bells emitting a ringtone. Ringers were commonly placed in the same housing as the subscriber set, which consisted of other electrical components, such as induction coils, capacitors, and, if required, a magneto generator. The subscriber set interfaced a telephone set to the telephone network, while magneto generators were used in a manual exchange to generate a remote ring signal. The Western Electric 302-type telephone was the first widely used Bell System telephone to include the ringer and other subscriber set components inside the housing of the telephone set. Almost all telephones manufactured since have an internal phone ringer. Components A ringer box consists of a case made of wood, metal, or plastic, containing bells or gongs and an electromagnetically-driven clapper which strikes the gongs when actuated. The electromagnet of the clapper responds to the alternating current sent from a central office exchange or another phone via the telephone network wiring. The direct current required by the telephone's audio circuitry is blocked with a capacitor before entering the ringer to prevent the ringer from being triggered by circuit interruptions and pulse dialing. Typical ring signals ranged from 60 to over 100 Volts at a frequency of 20-30 Hertz. Producers Ringer boxes were produced by all manufacturers of customer-premises telephone equipment. In North America, the prominent producers were Western Electric, Automatic Electric, and Kellogg Switchboard & Supply Company, while in Europe companies such as Siemens & Halske and Ericsson mass-produced devices.

It is a clump-forming epiphyte with dark green leaves and curved, branching flower stems with many white and cream-coloured flowers. Description Acriopsis emarginata is an epiphyte which forms dense clumps with the pseudobulbs surrounded by thin white roots. The pseudobulbs are pale green and onion-like, long and wide. There are between two and four dark green, leathery, narrow egg-shaped leaves which are long and wide. Wiry, branching flower stems long bear large numbers of cream- coloured to pinkish flowers which are wide and have a white, three-lobed, triangular labellum. Each flower has a thread-like pedicel long. The dorsal sepal is linear to oblong, long, about wide and the lateral sepals are fused to form a boat shape long, about wide below the labellum. The petals are linear to egg-shaped with similar dimensions to the lateral sepals. The labellum is long, about wide and has three lobes. The lateral lobes are broadly triangular and the middle lobe is short with two prominent calli. Flowering mainly occurs from June to November. Taxonomy and naming Acriopsis emarginata was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones and Mark Clements from a specimen collected in the Daintree River valley and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek words akris meaning \\"grasshopper\\" and opsis meaning \\"appearance\\" or \\"aspect\\", referring to the grashopper-like appearance of the column. The specific epithet (emarginata) is a Latin word meaning \\"notched at the apex\\", referring to the notch on the labellum callus. This species was formerly included with Acriopsis javanica but Australian plants are more robust with larger pseudobulbs and leaves and more highly branched flowering stems. Distribution and habitat The pale chandelier orchid is widespread and common in tropical Queensland from Cape York to the Daintree River. It grows near the crown of trees, palms and Pandanus.  Use in horticulture  Easy to grow, but needs water all year round, high humidity, and warmth (not below 10 ¬∞C). Can be grown on a slab or in a small pot with a coarse mix.

Milne, 1983, is one of three broad classes of underwater acoustic positioning systems that are used to track underwater vehicles and divers. The other two classes are ultra short baseline systems (USBL) and short baseline systems (SBL). LBL systems are unique in that they use networks of sea-floor mounted baseline transponders as reference points for navigation. These are generally deployed around the perimeter of a work site. The LBL technique results in very high positioning accuracy and position stability that is independent of water depth. It is generally better than 1-meter and can reach a few centimeters accuracy.NOAA Diving Manual, Edition 4, Underwater Navigation, Section 10.2., , LBL systems are generally employed for precision underwater survey work where the accuracy or position stability of ship-based (SBL, USBL) positioning systems does not suffice.  Operation and performance  Figure 2: A dive team (Envirotech Diving) with their AquaMap LBL acoustic underwater positioning system including three baseline transponders (B) and diver stations (A) mounted on scooters. The baseline stations are first deployed in the corners of a work site. Their relative position is then precisely measured using the AquaMap system's automatic acoustic self-survey capability. For geo-referenced operations, the baseline positions are surveyed by differential GPS or a laser positioning equipment (total station). During a dive, the diver station interrogates the baseline stations to measure the distances, which are then converted to positions. Long baseline systems determine the position of a vehicle or diver by acoustically measuring the distance from a vehicle or diver interrogator to three or more seafloor deployed baseline transponders. These range measurements, which are often supplemented by depth data from pressure sensors on the devices, are then used to triangulate the position of the vehicle or diver. In figure 1, a diver mounted interrogator (A) sends a signal, which is received by the baseline transponders (B, C, D). The transponders reply, and the replies are received again by the diver station (A). Signal run time measurements now yield the distances A-B, A-C and A-D, which are used to compute the diver position by triangulation or position search algorithms. The resulting positions are relative to the location of the baseline transducers. These can be readily converted to a geo-referenced coordinate system such as latitude/longitude or UTM if the geo-positions of the baseline stations are first established. Long baseline systems get their name from the fact that the spacing of the baseline transponders is long or similar to the distance between the diver or vehicle and the transponders.Handbook of Acoustics, Malcolm J. Crocker 1998, , 9780471252931, page 462 That is, the baseline transponders are typically mounted in the corners of an underwater work site within which the vehicle or diver operates. This method yields an ideal geometry for positioning, in which any given error in acoustic range measurements produce only about an equivalent position error.The ROV Manual, Robert D. Christ and Robert L. Wernli Sr, Section 4.2.8. Capabilities and Limitations of Acoustic Positioning, This compares to SBL and USBL systems with shorter baselines where ranging disturbances of a given amount can result in much larger position errors. Further, the mounting of the baseline transponders on the sea floor eliminates the need for converting between reference frames, as is the case for USBL or SBL positioning systems mounted on moving vessels.The ROV Manual, Section 4.2.6.4 Long Baseline (LBL) Finally, sea floor mounting makes the positioning accuracy independent of water depth.LBL Underwater Positioning, Hydro International Magazine, Jan/Feb 2008, Volume 12, Number 1 For these reasons LBL systems are generally applied to tasks where the required standard of positioning accuracy or reliability exceeds the capabilities of USBL and SBL systems.  History  The search and inspection of the lost nuclear submarine USS Thresher by the U.S. Navy oceanographic vessel USNS Mizar in 1963 is frequently credited as the origin of modern underwater acoustic navigation systems.Milne, Chapter 2 Mizar primarily used a short baseline (SBL) system to track the bathyscaphe Trieste 1. However, its capability also included seafloor transponders, which in conjunction with early navigation satellites supported station-keeping with a precision of about 300 feet, considered remarkable at the time.The Universe Below, Page 77, William J. Broad & Dimitry Schidlovski 1998, ,  Examples  Figure 3: Precisely establishing the position of nuclear submarines prior to missile launches was an early application of long baseline acoustic positioning systems. Covert networks of sea floor transponders could survive and provide a precision navigation capability even after GPS satellites had been knocked out. By the mid-1960s and possibly earlier, the Soviets were developing underwater navigation systems including seafloor transponders to allow nuclear submarines to operate precisely while staying submerged.History of Russian Underwater Acoustics, page 722. Oleg A. Godin, David R. Palmer, 2008, , Besides navigating through canyons and other difficult underwater terrain, there was also a need to establish the position of the submarine prior to the launch of a nuclear missile (ICBM). In 1981, acoustic positioning was proposed as part of the U.S. military's MX missile system.MX Missile Basing, pages 173-175, 1981, , A network of 150 covert transponder fields was envisioned. Submarines typically are guided by inertial navigation systems, but these dead reckoning systems develop position drift which must be corrected by occasional position fixes from a GNSS system. If the enemy were to knock out the GNSS satellites, the submarine could rely on the covert transponder network to establish its position and program the missile's own inertial navigation system for launch.

October 31, 2001) was an American athlete, singer and businessman who served as the namesake for Holden Caulfield in J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye and was the godfather of Judy Collins. Early life Bowler was born in Shoshone, Idaho on September 23, 1912, but his family moved to Gooding, Idaho in 1920, where he spent the rest of his childhood and attended school where he excelled athletically. During high school, Bowler ran track, and set the Idaho state record for the half-mile, which remained unbroken for twelve years. Although his obituary claimed he reached the semifinals of the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, this is not true and he never participated in either the Olympic Games or the 1932 US Olympic trials. In 1931, Bowler entered the University of Idaho, staying there until 1935 without graduating. While at the university, Bowler joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, through which he met Thomas Collins, later the father of singer Judy Collins. The two became close friends, often singing and drinking together. As a result of their friendship, Bowler became the godfather of Judy Collins, who later described his singing voice as \\"magnificent.\\" Musical career After leaving the University of Idaho, Bowler moved to Chicago to pursue his dream of becoming a professional singer, and worked with a voice coach in 1935 and 1936. He then moved to New York City and joined the Robert Shaw Chorale. Bowler was as a soloist in the group for three years, but was one of the first members to leave, in 1939. After leaving the chorale, Bowler became the headline singer of the McCormick Cruise line on its voyage to South America. While working on the McCormick line, Bowler first met J.D. Salinger, who worked as a staff boy on the same ship. The two quickly developed a friendship, riding bicycles together while in port and discussing their hopes for the future. During one of their conversations, Salinger told Bowler that he hoped to become a writer and would use the name Holden in one of his future books. In 1951, Salinger finished his book Catcher in the Rye and wrote to Bowler, informing him that the book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield was named for him. Ann Bowler, Holden's wife, later recounted that Salinger told Bowler: \\"what you like about Holden (Caulfield) is taken from you, and what you don't like about him, I made up.\\" Military and business career At the beginning of World War II Bowler left singing and enlisted in the Army, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant. Bowler was promoted to the rank of captain before the D-Day landings and served in the section responsible for coordinating the logistics of the attack. After D-Day, he \\"oversaw all German and Italian Prisoners of War brought to England.\\" While in England, he also met Ann Marion Childs, whom he married in 1945; the two went on to have four children. After the war, Bowler stayed in the United States Army Reserve, retiring in 1962 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. In the 1950s, Bowler moved to Denver, where he entered business. He initially sold advertisements for a local radio station, KYMR-AM, then joined the Halclark Advertising agency in Denver. In 1961, he started his own advertising firm, Bowler Associates. Starting in 1969, he also worked with the Denver school district, doing environmental education. He retired in 1971 and moved to Bliss, Idaho where he died in 2001 at the age of 89.227 Clayton Street in Denver. Former location of Bowler Associates.

This was followed a couple of weeks later by another widespread culling in Jining, Shandong province in western China after 16 people died from rabies. China uses both the compulsory vaccination and registration of pets and the killing of strays as instruments in rabies control. Dogs, except in cages for sale as meat, are not allowed in a number of urban areas and strays are killed. World Health Organization reports attribute some part of a rise in rabies in China in the 1980s to economic reforms which saw an increase in dog populations in rural areas, and later in the 1990s to an increase in the demand for dog meat and to problems with rabies vaccine quality. The 1980s increase was dealt with primarily with a large-scale vaccination campaign in rural areas where dog rabies is endemic, but some dog slaughters also took place. Outbreaks in Beijing in the early to mid-1990s were also dealt with by ordering strike teams to capture and kill dogs, including pets, making this 2006 governmental killing of dogs a single incident among a number of similar mass killings. The World Health Organization also recommends a ban on bringing dog meat from rural to urban areas.

The government ordered all dogs within a radius range of 3206 square kilometres to be killed, including registered and vaccinated dogs. In a statement to China Daily, Dang Zhengqing stated this was the only way they could stop the spread of rabies. Preventive measures People who are already pet owners were advised to register their dogs and vaccinate them. These vaccinations were offered for free. Stray and wild dogs within the region were also put down by the government. It was reported that over 20,000 dogs had been killed in the city of Hanzhong alone. Free leashes were also provided to allow citizens to control their dogs.

He was born in the Highland town of Caol near Fort William in Scotland, and played for Aberdeen in the Scottish Football League. He was the youngest player to have ever made their debut for Aberdeen until Fraser Fyvie broke his record. He is one of only three Aberdeen players to have made their debut at 16 years of age. He was nicknamed the White Pele and The Pele of the North because of his unique skill on the ball. When George signed for South Melbourne Hellas in Australia, he became the most expensive player to enter the country with a transfer fee from Aberdeen to Australian club South Melbourne Hellas for ¬£20,000 (AUD 50,000). This was an enormous amount of money, considering the 21-year-old planned to stay at the club for only one year before returning to the Scottish Football League. Playing career George Campbell played for Lochaber before joining the Kilmallie Youth Club as a 14-year-old in 1971. Campbell turned professional when he signed for Aberdeen FC in 1972, initially as a schoolboy. He spent seven seasons at Pittodrie Stadium as a left-sided midfielder. While at the Dons, George represented Scotland at the UEFA European Youth Championship Qualifiers in 1972 and 1973 at the age of 15 and 16. Campbell was the youngest player to have ever made his debut for Aberdeen at 16 years and 8 months old, making his debut against Hearts on 10 August 1974 in a Scottish League Cup game at Pittodrie. The mark stood for 35 years until 22 August 2009 when Fraser Fyvie broke his record by a margin of 3 months. Campbell won the 1975 Scottish Reserve Cup before breaking into the Aberdeen first team. He won the 1976 Scottish League Cup after Aberdeen beat Celtic 2‚Äì1 at Hampden Park in front of 69,707 supporters (though he did not take part in the match). He played a total of 15 Premier League and Cup matches, playing numerous senior friendly and European qualifying matches. He scored one of his two career goals for Aberdeen in the Anglo-Scottish Cup against St Johnstone on 6 August 1975, winning 2‚Äì0,and the other in a friendly game against League of Ireland club Finn Harps on 17 March 1976. Aberdeen had already beaten the Harps in the UEFA Cup in 1973. He was signed by South Melbourne FC in 1978, Australia's most successful football club in history, who played in the National Soccer League of Australia, for a transfer fee of ¬£20,000 (AUD 50,000). He became the most expensive player to enter the country and had planned to stay in Australia for only one season before returning to the Scottish Football League in a link with Dundee United's Jim McLean, although another broken leg prevented him from doing so. George was one of the best footballing talents ever to play in Australia's National Soccer League and in 1999 became a 'legend' of South Melbourne FC and is in South Melbourne's Hall of Fame at Bob Jane Stadium. Campbell won the Ampol Cup with South Melbourne FC in 1982 and helped South become runners up in the NSL in 1981 which was South's best ever National Soccer League placing at the time. In 1982, after 104 appearances and 17 goals with South Melbourne FC, George moved to National Soccer League club rivals Preston Makedonia and stayed there for three seasons, making 50 appearances and scoring 8 goals. He helped Preston reach the 1985 NSL Cup Final against Sydney Olympic at St. George's Stadium. He then moved to another NSL club, Green Gully, in 1985, where he made 29 appearances and scored 4 goals, winning the 1986 Dockerty Cup. He then signed for Box Hill Inter in the Victorian Premier League and stayed there for 2 seasons making 62 appearances and scoring 29 goals. George then signed for Fawkner Blues who were also in the VPL. He made 24 appearances for the Blues and scored 2 goals. Campbell was named the Player of the Year at Victorian Premier League club Fawkner FC for season 1989. George regularly appeared on Australia's only national football television programme called 'Match of the Day' on free-to-air channel 028, now known as SBS. Campbell was not eligible for Socceroo representation as he had already represented Scotland, although he did represent Victoria and played against American footballing giants New York Cosmos, featuring German legend Franz Beckenbauer, Dutch legend Johan Neeskens and Carlos Alberto, one of Brazil's most highly regarded defenders of all time. Coaching career Campbell was the senior assistant coach and under-21s coach at Essendon Royals in the Victorian Premier League in seasons 2000 and 2001. With the seniors, Campbell won the Victorian State League Division 1 and were promoted to the Victorian Premier League in 2001. George then won the U21 Victorian Premier League title with Essendon in season 2001. Campbell was the Football Federation Victoria U14 & U15 State Representative Coach in 2005 & 2006\\\\. Ex A League Melbourne Victory Senior Coach, Mehmet Durakovic, was his assistant for the FFV U14 state team in 2006. He also held various roles within the Football Federation Victoria, in particular being the brainchild of the youth Champions League Summer football program, having set up the first Academy system in Victoria. He was the Head Coach of the Northcote City U21/Reserve Team who played in the Victorian Premier League for the 2010 season. George also runs his own academy named Melbourne Football STARS. He has taken football tours annually overseas composed of Melbourne's elite youth footballers to Scotland, England, Spain, Holland, Germany and Italy to play against European footballing opposition. He currently coaches Xavier College Firsts soccer team and in 2011, 2015 & 2018 led them to win the prestigious Associated Public Schools (APS) trophy and the Australian Jesuit Cup in 2011, 2014 & 2015\\\\.

Early life Acland was born in 1904 in Christchurch. His parents were Sir Hugh Acland (1874‚Äì1956), a prominent surgeon in New Zealand, and Evelyn Mary Acland (n√©e Ovans). His great-grandfather was Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet. His brother-in-law was Sir John Ormond. His cousin was Felicity Lusk, headmistress. He was educated at Waihi School and Christ's College. When riding his motorbike, Acland was hit by a car on Christchurch's Park Terrace in October 1924. He suffered a complex break of his leg just above the ankle, and spent over a month in bed at his parents‚Äô house, Chippenham Lodge. With Frederick Wilding as his lawyer, he won a substantial compensation from the driver, and used the money to have his leg reset in England, where he spent one year. Despite this, he limped for the rest of his life. On 12 June 1935, Acland married Katherine \\"Kit\\" Wilder Ormond, daughter of John Davies Ormond Jr. and granddaughter of John Davies Ormond Sr. The wedding was held at St Mary's Church at Waipukurau. He worked on farms in South Canterbury, was a stockman and a driver. He worked in various jobs in Australia for some time before taking on the management of Mount Peel Station, which had been established by his grandfather, John Acland. Due to his leg injury, he was rejected by the army. Political career He was elected to Parliament in the Canterbury electorate of Temuka in the , filling the vacancy caused by the death of Thomas Burnett. He was confirmed in the 1943 general election. The Temuka electorate was abolished for the , when he stood in the electorate and was defeated by the incumbent from the Labour Party, Clyde Carr. Acland gained prominence in the wool industry. He chaired the New Zealand Wool Board (1960‚Äì1972) and was vice-president of the International Wool Secretariat. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1968 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to the wool industry. He died on 27 January 1981.

The specification had formerly recommended support for playback of Theora video and Vorbis audio encapsulated in Ogg containers to provide for easier distribution of audio and video over the internet by using open standards, but the recommendation was soon after dropped. Motivation Because some visitors and publishers choose not to take part in the use of proprietary software, web content has been made available through open standards in order to reach these users. As multimedia is already mainstream on the web through proprietary data formats (such as Windows Media Video and MP4) and browser plugins (such as Adobe Flash Player), developers had hoped Theora and Vorbis would become part of the HTML5 specification. Users affiliated with the free software movement claimed the following advantages: * The potential for universal adoption of Theora and Vorbis, no matter the computer or the user, would ease \\"codec hell\\" by eliminating an unnecessary amount of codecs required to view and publish videos to a select few. * Browser plugins needed to accommodate the many different codecs would then become a thing of the past: ** Browsers could handle the playback of Theora and Vorbis and allow the user to customize the manner in which that was done. ** Bugs and exploits in obsolete versions of those plugins would affect the user less, as they are phased out; the loss of multiple attack vectors would happen once browser plugins were ultimately removed. ** The HTML5-conformant player, not having to be coded for compatibility with different browsers, could make bugs and exploits easier to find during browser development, and any exploits found would only be able to target that one browser. * Free software encoders would compete with rival proprietary encoders, increasing encoder quality through competition. * Embedding of multimedia by the use of clear and straightforward \`video\` and \`audio\` elements would require less effort than mastering the \`object\` element or learning ActionScript as required by Adobe Flash. CTO at Opera Software, H√•kon Wium Lie explained in a Google tech talk entitled \\"The element\\" the proposal of Theora as the video format for HTML5: After the presentation, Lie was asked whether Opera will support other formats than Ogg: Support Opera Software and Mozilla have been advocates for including the Ogg formats into the HTML standard. Support has been available in experimental builds of Opera 9.5 since 2007, and Ogg Theora is fully supported since Opera 10.50. Gecko 1.9.1 (browsers based on this engine include Mozilla Firefox 3.5 and SeaMonkey 2.0), released on June 30, 2009, was the first non-experimental layout engine to support Ogg formats. Google Chrome included support in their 3.0 release (September 2009), along with support for H.264. However, they did not support MPEG-1 (the parts patents on which are thought to have expired), citing concerns over performance. Microsoft began work in October 2017 on implementing support for Ogg, Vorbis, and Theora in Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge. Opposition On October 17, 2007, the World Wide Web Consortium encouraged interested people to take part in a \\"Video on the Web Workshop\\", held on December 12, 2007, for two days. A number of global companies were involved, submitting position papers. Among them, Nokia's paper states that \\"a W3C-led standardization of a 'free' codec, or the active endorsement of proprietary technology such as Ogg [...] by W3C, is, in our opinion, not helpful\\". Xiph.org's codecs, while licensed under a BSD-style permissive free software license, implement a standard controlled by Xiph.org themselves, rather than a multi-vendor community such as MPEG. Apple Inc., a member of the MPEG LA, has also opposed the inclusion of Ogg formats in the HTML standard on the grounds that H.264 performs better and is already more widely supported, citing patents on their codec's efficiency and the lack of precedents of \\"Placing requirements on format support\\", even at the \\"SHOULD\\" level, in HTML specifications. Recommendation retracted On December 10, 2007, the HTML 5 specification was updated, replacing the reference to Theora and Vorbis with a placeholder: The removal of the Ogg formats from the specification made it completely file format neutral, like previous versions of HTML. The decision was criticized by a number of Web developers. A follow-up discussion also occurred on the W3C questions and answers blog. In response to criticism, the WHATWG has cited concerns over the Ogg formats still being within patent lifetime and thus vulnerable to unknown patents. Such submarine patents may also exist for formats like MP3. Also, the AVC patent licensing policy is subject to change in a not-yet-clear manner. Adoption , HTML5 video is not currently as widespread as Flash videos, though of recent rollouts of experimental HTML5-based video players on websites, DailyMotion is so far the only one to use Ogg Theora and Vorbis formats, which suggests an increasing early interest in adopting HTML5 video. \\"WebRTC Audio Codec and Processing Requirements\\" Internet standard drafts, published in 2011-2013, require free formats, including Opus, which was developed, among others, by programmers associated with Xiph.Org Foundation (the maintainer of Ogg).http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb- audio-03https://wiki.xiph.org/OpusFAQ See also *HTML5 video References *Codecs for and ‚Äì Ian Hickson (summary of situation as of June 29, 2009) Category:HTML Category:HTML5 Category:Markup languages Category:World Wide Web Consortium standards Category:XML-based standards ","title":"Use of Ogg formats in HTML5"},{"id":"23077856","text":"The Royal Chapel of St. Anthony of La Florida () is a Neoclassical chapel in central Madrid. The chapel is best known for its ceiling and dome frescoes by Francisco Goya. It is also his final burial place. History leftThe chapel was built in the general location of two prior chapels built in the 1730s, which were on the land of a farm called La Florida. The present structure was built by Felipe Fontana from 1792 to 1798 on the orders of King Carlos IV, who also commissioned the frescoes by Goya and his assistant Asensio Juli√°. The structure was declared a national monument in 1905. In 1919 Goya's remains were transferred here from Bordeaux, where he had died in 1828. Famously, the skull was missing, a detail the Spanish consul had immediately advised to his superiors in Madrid, who wired back, \\"Send Goya, with or without head.\\" In 1928 an identical chapel was built alongside the original, in order to allow the original to be converted into a museum, and the headless remains were moved again. On every June 13, the chapel becomes the site of a lively pilgrimage in which young unwed women come to pray to Saint Anthony and to ask for a partner. Frescoes The frescoes by Goya were completed over a six- month period in 1798. The frescoes portray miracles by Saint Anthony of Padua. On the main cupola of the chapel Goya depicted Saint Anthony raising a man from the dead and exculpating his father, who had been falsely accused of his murder. Instead of portraying the scene as occurring in thirteenth-century Lisbon, Goya relocated the miracle to contemporary Madrid.

The Leloir Institute is a non-profit research center in Buenos Aires specializing in biochemistry, cellular biology, molecular biology, and related activities. Overview The research center was inaugurated in 1947 by way of an initiative of University of Buenos Aires Physiology Professors Bernardo Houssay and Luis Leloir. The project was funded by the philanthropic support of local textile industrialist Jaime Campomar, and Dr. Houssay devoted a share of the proceeds from the Nobel Prize in Physiology he earned that year to the establishment of the institute. Initially located in a belle √©poque building in the Palermo section of Buenos Aires, the institute was first directed by Dr. Leloir and, following Campomar's death in 1956, it became a recipient of an endowment from both the Rockefeller Institute and the National Institutes of Health, both in the United States. The institute was formally named the Campomar Institute of Research in Biochemistry in 1958, when it was relocated to a utilitarian building belonging to the city's health ministry in the Belgrano section, nearby.Leloir Institute: history Drs. Luis Leloir (left) and Carlos Cardini at work in the institute's former facilities (1960). Dr. Leloir's work at the institute on nucleotides and their role in human metabolic pathways earned him the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physiology. This became known as ‚ÄúLeloir's pathway‚Äù and was a significant advance for biochemistry. As a consequence of this 1957 discovery, the cause of a congenital disease called galactosemia was first identified; not detected in time, it can cause mental retardation, cataracts and cirrhosis. Numerous other colleagues of his at the institute became well known in their fields, as well. These have included Enrico Cabib, Carlos Cardini, Ranwell Caputto, Alejandro Paladini, and Ra√∫l Trucco, among others. The continued support of the Campomar Foundation allowed the institute to relocate to its current facilities in 1983. Located in the Caballito section of the city and facing Parque Centenario, the new facilities total over 6,900 m¬≤ (74,000 ft¬≤) and include laboratories, teaching facilities, an auditorium and the National Biochemistry Reference Library. It was renamed the Leloir Institute in recognition of its longtime director (who died in 1987), in 2001. That year, the center initiated its program of \\"repatriation of researchers,\\" in a bid to both incorporate new scientific staff, as well as to help reverse the long-standing brain drain suffered by the Argentine scientific community. The center maintains numerous cooperation agreements with not only prominent local research centers such as the CONICET and University of Buenos Aires School of Exact Sciences; but also respected international centers, such as Partners Harvard Medical International, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Inis Biotech, and the Weizmann Institute. It hosts 24 research teams and 170 scientists, whose varied specialties include neuroscience, cellular biology, oncology, gene therapy, epidemiology, biotechnology and structural biology; among its associated fellows is the recipient of 1984 Nobel Prize in Physiology, Dr. C√©sar Milstein. Construction started on the institute's new annex in 2007, consisting of 2,900 m¬≤ (31,000 ft¬≤) of space for imaging, as well as for expanded research on cell cultures and biophysics. These investments continue the Leloir Institute's tradition as a leader in science and technology in Argentina.

Micklethwait and Wooldridge provided a quick coverage of American history, in which they argue that American religion was dramatically transformed by the disestablishment of churches after the American Revolution. An emerging \\"free market\\" of religious choices led Americans to become increasingly pluralistic and tolerant of other forms of Christianity. The voluntary nature of religious association led Americans to take ownership of their own institutions and churches, helping create a democratic sense of responsibility for creating associations and community. These features of American culture, along with the First Amendment's separation of church and state, ensured that American religions could only survive by appealing to the common people. This democratized American Christianity, leading average Americans to shape religious movements themselves. In the post-Revolutionary period, all this led America in an increasingly pluralist and democratic direction.John Micklethwait and Arian Wooldridge, God is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith is Changing the World (New York: Penguin Press, 2009), 1-27. Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that the religions growing around the world tend to exhibit these same features. World religions‚Äîand Christianity, in particular‚Äîare growing fastest where they are: competing with other religious alternatives, unsupported by state governments, and entirely dependent upon popular interest. Writing against the fear that the growth of religion will increase warfare and strife, Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that a democratic and pluralistic culture would help minimize these dangers while maximizing the benefits of religion. Finally, while the authors suggest that Islam too could be modernized and introduced to a pluralistic culture, they suspect that Islam is less amenable for this transition than Christianity.

Opened on October 14, 1950, it was built in the same location as the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which collapsed due to a windstorm on November 7, 1940. It is the older of the twin bridges that make up the Tacoma Narrows Bridge crossing of the Tacoma Narrows, and carried both directions of traffic across the strait until 2007. At the time of its construction, the bridge was, like its predecessor, the third-longest suspension bridge in the world in terms of main span length, behind the Golden Gate Bridge and George Washington Bridge; it is now the 46th longest suspension bridge in the world. Design work on a new Tacoma Narrows Bridge began shortly after the collapse of the original bridge. However, several engineering issues, the demand on steel created by the United States' involvement in World War II, and the state of Washington's inability to find an insurer, all pushed the start of construction to April 1948. The new bridge was designed with a wider deck and taller and wider towers than its predecessor, and addressed the wind issues that led to the original bridge's collapse. It opened to the public on October 14, 1950, and carried both directions of Primary State Highway 14 for over 40 years. Tolls were charged on the bridge until 1965, 13 years ahead of schedule. By 1990, population growth and development on the Kitsap Peninsula caused vehicular traffic on the bridge to exceed its design capacity. In 1998, voters in several Washington counties approved an advisory measure to create a twin bridge to span the Tacoma Narrows. After a series of protests and court battles, construction began on the second span in 2002. The second span opened in July 2007 to carry eastbound traffic, and the 1950 bridge was reconfigured to carry westbound traffic. Design The designs for the 1950 Tacoma Narrows Bridge were drawn up not long after the 1940 collapse of its predecessor. In July 1941, the Washington Toll Bridge Authority appointed Charles E. Andrew (who had been involved in Gertie's design and construction as a consultant) as principal engineer and chairman of the consulting board in charge of designing a new span across the Narrows. Members of the new design board included Dr. Theodore von K√°rm√°n, Glenn Woodruff, and the firm of Sverdrup and Parcel of Chicago, Illinois. To lead the design team, Andrew picked Dexter R. Smith as lead designer and principal architect. As early as October 1941, less than a year after Gertie's collapse, the WTBA had adopted a rough design for a new span. The new design closely resembled the original design for the 1940 span drawn up by Clark Eldridge. The cost of construction on the new design was then estimated at $7 million (US$ in present terms). Since the original bridge became a major asset in the short time it was in service, the U.S. Navy lobbied heavily for a combination highway/railroad span across the Narrows to replace Gertie, and proposed a steel-cantilever-type bridge over a suspension span. However, the extra steel needed to construct such a structure across the Narrows would have added an extra $8.5 million (US$ in present terms) to the construction cost, ruling out any possibility of such a structure ever being built. Furthermore, the proposed design needed new testing. A purely mathematical solution to designing suspension spans was not possible because little was known about the forces that brought down Gertie. In light of that fact, engineers chose to design the replacement, then subject scale mockups of the design in a specially-built wind tunnel constructed at the University of Washington. According to Charles Andrew, \\"The only way to attack the problem, was to design a bridge, then build a model of that design and subject it to wind action.\\" The testing was performed by Professor F. B. Farquharson, who had researched Gertie's motions prior to its collapse on November 7, 1940. From late 1941 onward, Professor Farquharson (as well as von Karman, who did his work at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California) continued to work on the new bridge design. By 1943, he was working in a specially-designed wind tunnel laboratory built on the University of Washington campus in Seattle. The facility was large enough to house a scale model of the completed bridge as long as , plus section models for further testing. After Farquharson confirmed that Gertie collapsed due to its excessive flexibility and the aerodynamic forces as a result of the flexibility in its span, testing was then done on designs drawn by Smith. All of the new designs would feature a deep open stiffening truss instead of a solid plate girder. Testing on the new bridge design was begun in November 1943 and continued through 1945. The studies included 200 different configurations, to wind forces hitting the span at up to plus-or-minus 45-degrees perpendicular to the deck. Then, testing was performed on a design using open strips of wind grating placed in the roadway, which added even greater stability against torsional movement. A design with bottom lateral bracing on the stiffening truss was also tested to test the resistance against lateral movement. Then, a design was tested with motion damping devices located on the deck at three locations: one at each tower (one at each end of the main span, and one on each side span at the tower), and a set of damping devices at mid-span on each main cable. Each of these steps in the design and testing phase were performed to reduce as much lateral and torsional movement as possible. After $80,000 (US$ in present terms) was spent in the design and testing of the new span, the design was completed on December 5, 1945. The WTBA finalized and approved revised designs from Dexter's drawings in December in April, 1946, and minor revisions continued on until September. The new span was to have a construction cost of $8.5 million (US$ in present terms). A detailed closeup of the stiffening truss. Photo is of the west side span, photographed from under the 2007 span's west side span on the shore of The Narrows. Photo also illustrates the flow-through wind grating. The final designs of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, once finalized, were a sharp and drastic contrast from the design by Leon Moisseiff. Instead of a thin plate girder, an open-air stiffening truss with a depth of would form the new road deck. Newer, larger towers that rose higher and wider than Gertie's towers, would support the bridge's main cables, now in diameter versus Gertie's . Newer, larger anchor blocks would support a load that weighed 1.6 times as much as the original bridge. However, some elements of Galloping Gertie were incorporated into the 1950 span. The tower pedestals were enlarged and raised . On the west end stood a long approach viaduct with the same deep girders Gertie's main deck had. This approach viaduct used three support towers, two with thin support beams and one with the structural complexity and design of one of Gertie's main towers - each spaced apart. The viaduct, after a structural examination, was kept and utilized as part of the 1950 bridge's design, with an additional box strut brace added to the tower closest the shoreline (officially known as Tower #3 in the design plans), and widening of the upper box strut for the new bridge's deck. The road deck itself was seen as a major innovation in suspension bridge design. Lanes of traffic on typical suspension bridge roadways are divided by dashed paint lines, a solid strip, or a set of two strips of paint. On the 1950 span's final roadway design, the -wide roadway was split into four lanes of traffic, each lane being wide. Each lane was separated by a deep, -wide open air wind grate. Bordering the outside lanes was a open air wind grate that supported a pipe curb elevated off the roadway. These also formed the separation between the roadway, and a -wide sidewalk on both sides that was fenced in by a -high railing. Construction Constructing the replacement Tacoma Narrows Bridge was delayed for nearly a decade primarily due to the demand on steel created by World War II, and the fact that the state had trouble arranging insurance for the new span. On April 30, 1947, Governor Monrad Wallgren had announced that insurance had finally been arranged. It wasn't until August 1947 that Washington finally requested bids for the construction, and by that time, the price tag for construction went from $8.5 million (US$ in present terms) to $11.2 million (US$ in present terms). On October 15, the state opened bids for the construction, with Bethlehem Pacific Steel Corporation bidding $8,263,904 (US$ in present terms) on construction of the superstructure, and John A. Roebling's Sons Company of San Francisco bidding $2,932,681 (US$ in present terms) for the construction of the suspension cable system. After several delays involving final financing, the WTBA finally offered a $14 million (US$ in present terms) bond that was to be repaid via tolls on the bridge, as well as Pierce County offering a $1.5 million (US$ in present terms) bond guarantee fund. On March 12, 1948 the state finally completed bond financing. And after steel became more readily available, the puzzle pieces began falling together in rapid fashion. The construction contracts were finally awarded on March 31, and April 1, and by April 9, earth moving began at the remains of Gertie's east cable anchorage. =Anchorages= Since the replacement span was going to be 1.6 times heavier than the bridge it replaced, as well as four lanes instead of two, modification and partial demolition was necessary to begin construction on the newer, and much more massive, cable anchorages at each end of the bridge. The center of the old anchorages were kept as cores, and a newer eyebar system set at apart (versus for the previous bridge) were constructed. They would support a much larger cable load from the original to a much heavier , and consisted of steel eyebars long, with diameter shoes, embedded into new concrete. Each new anchor would weigh and would be embedded deep into compacted soil. Construction of the new cable anchorages was started during the summer of 1948 and continued into 1949. =Tower pedestals= Due to the water depth of the narrows, the Tower Pedestals are each the size of a 20-story office building, with an overall size of , on which rest the towers. They are designed to withstand daily currents and a twice-daily tidal swing. Each tower pedestal used of concrete for construction. The tower pedestals had creosote timber fenders, which were installed in 1948 to deflect marine debris and traffic, which were removed sometime between 1995 and 2000. The tower pedestals that supported Gertie's towers were found to be structurally sound and unharmed after the failure of that span, and were reused for the current bridge. The towers of the 1940 span in their short service time experienced corrosion from salt water spray at their bases, so engineers constructed new tops to the pedestals, at the same time the anchorages were being built, to allow for tower construction to begin in near unison. The new tower pedestals (called piers in the designs) were raised to prevent the corrosion issue, and were enlarged where the towers would stand to provide more structural rigidity. The east and west piers were completed in mid-December 1948. =Towers= The original towers for the 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge featured four deep, box-shaped struts (two below the roadway and two above), as well as being tapered from being wide at the base to at the top. The new towers of the replacement span were to be the same width both at the bottom and the top, and were to feature a deep X-bracing system with three -deep single X-brace struts below the road deck and a series of three double-X brace struts of varying depths above the roadway (top being , middle being , and the bottom being ). Tower construction began January 1, 1949, and progressed rapidly. Work went ahead of schedule and by April 1949, the steel cable saddles were prepared for lifting. On April 13, 1949, the north cable saddle on the east tower was bolted into place on a set of shims to allow workers to rivet the top plate into place. Then, disaster struck. That morning, an earthquake measuring 7.1 rattled the Puget Sound region. The earthquake caused the towers to sway from vertical, causing the cable saddle to shear its bolts and fall off the tower . The saddle fell below. It missed the pedestal, and plunged straight through a barge, to a final resting spot below the surface of the Narrows, away from the pedestal. The resulting impact sank the barge, taking a compressor and numerous other tools with it. Divers soon located the cable saddle in a deep hole during a slack tide (the only time divers could operate, and slack tides only occurred at night). After a three-day delay, it was raised to the surface, repaired (the impact bent a corner on it), and reinstalled. The earthquake delayed completion of both the east and west towers on the bridge. After the earthquake's aftershocks subsided, work resumed, and by July 17 both towers were announced as being completed. =Cables= Galloping Gertie Construction of the main cables began by erecting their wide catwalks in July. On July 17, 1949, the first catwalk line was towed via tugboat across the Narrows, then lifted onto the towers. The catwalks, consisting of diameter wire base cables, cyclone-wire fencing, and a center section of wood slats, were erected in sections. On September 15, the catwalks were completed and the spinning gear was in place. Harold Hills, a field engineer for Roebling's Sons Company, became the first man to cross the Narrows via the catwalks. On the following day, Harry Cornelius, an inspector for the WTBA became the second to cross the Narrows on the catwalks. To begin preparations for spinning the main cables, Roebling's Sons had set up a reeling plant on the Tacoma tideflats. of galvanized steel wire - the total amount needed for both main cables, began arriving in coils. Shipped in from Trenton, New Jersey, these coils were then transferred to intermediate reels, then wound onto a final reel of steel wire that held it at uniform tension. Each diameter reel of wire weighed , and contained of wire. October 13, the guide wires for cable operations were installed, and cable spinning operations began. 19 cable strands, each carrying 458 number 6-gauge steel wire comprised the main suspension cables (a total of 8,705 per cable). The first strand to be completed was a cable strand on the north cable, on October 26. Working three shifts 24 hours per day, Roebling's Sons were delayed a few times due to weather and high winds. On January 16, 1950, amidst one of the worst winters in local record, workers completed the main cables. Cable band placement and vertical suspender cable installation was complete by March 7, and deck construction began almost immediately. =Stiffening truss= The stiffening truss damping mechanism at the towers. The hydraulic shock damping mechanisms themselves are seen as small cylinders where the diagonal bracing meets the towers (each one is in diameter and long). Construction of the new road deck and stiffening truss of the 1950 span was conducted differently than had been done in Gertie's case. In 1940, the road deck was prefabricated in long sections on the Tacoma tideflats, then barged to the site via tugboats and hoisted into place via gantry cranes installed on the main cable. When construction of the road deck began in early March, workers installed a Chicago boom high above the roadway level, upon which prefabricated stiffening truss assemblies each -by- were hoisted into place. After the deck assemblies were hoisted into place and finished, four traveling derricks were then lifted onto the completed deck sections. After the traveling derricks (called \\"layleg rigs\\" by the crew) were assembled and readied, the deck was then assembled in a series of steps. On the new bridge, the stiffening truss featured a series of outer members called \\"chords\\" that formed the top and bottom of the stiffening truss. These were installed first, then the diagonal and vertical truss members on the sides were installed. Next, an deep stiffening truss \\"floor beam\\" perpendicular to the length of the bridge was installed at intervals of (the distance between suspender cables; they were installed at each vertical beam member in the stiffening truss). These floor beams, each wide, would form the upper lateral stiffening mechanism in the deck itself. After the floor beams were installed, at alternate floor beam panel points a set of diagonal bracing struts were installed. Then, a series of lateral bracing struts were installed on the top and bottom of the road deck - that connected to the outer steel chords. Next, a series of eight deep I-beam \\"stringers\\" were installed (positioned longitudinally). This was the final steelwork step involved, and the deck was soon raised on each corner to attach the suspender cables and their \\"jewels\\" to the vertical stiffening truss members. Unlike Gertie, whose preassembled deck sections were first raised into place at the center of the main span and the ends of the sidespans, on the new bridge the stiffening truss was erected first at each tower, and then progressed outwards. Four work crews, one on each side span and two on the main span (one each side) worked together completing each step in intervals (completing an average of of steelwork per day). The side span crews worked towards shore and the main span crews worked towards each other, and by May 1949, work was nearing completion. On May 28, ironworkers installed the closing top chord on the main span, and over the next two days workers finished closing the span up. On June 1, the steel stiffening truss of the road deck was declared complete. =Final deckwork and construction= Throughout the summer of 1950, as many as 200 men were involved in the final steps of completion of the 1950 Tacoma Narrows Bridge. On July 24, workers from Roebling's Sons were involved in wrapping and caulking the suspender cable bands, and the railings on the sidewalks were being completed. By August 22, the road deck was taking shape, as workers continued concrete pours for the roadway. Painting began that week, as eleven men worked the paint crew sandblasting and painting the stiffening truss. The bridge received its first coat of \\"Narrows Green\\" paint - a grayish-green hue (its predecessor had been painted the same color a decade before). By September 30, workers installed the finishing touches on the toll plazas, including installing sheetrock and plumbing. The midspan and tower hydraulic damping mechanisms were also installed, and workers began removing the catwalks, tower buttresses, and other working platforms. Work also progressed at the west end of the bridge, where workers modified the long approach viaduct that once had been a part of the 1940 span for use in the 1950 bridge. There, workers added bracing and brackets that would widen the viaduct from , to accommodate the widened roadway width of . Opening The bridge opened to toll-paid traffic on October 14, 1950. The opening day tolls were fifty cents one way per car and driver, and an additional ten cents per passenger. Thousands attended opening day ceremonies, including Governor Arthur B. Langlie. A commemorative pamphlet published by the Tacoma News Tribune was distributed, as well as scores of speeches given. After 30 months of construction, the Narrows was bridged again. Traffic counts following the opening day ceremonies steadily rose in the first few years, just as they had in the four months Gertie was in service. Five years after the bridge opened, the average count was 4,699 vehicles per day. By 1960, an average of 6,218 vehicles crossed, and in 1965, fifteen years after the bridge opened, the figure from 1960 was doubled. With an average of 11,267 vehicles per day, the Washington Toll Bridge Authority soon removed the tolls. In early 1965, a bill passed the state legislature removing the tolls, and on May 14, 1965, in a ceremony at the toll plaza, Governor Dan Evans signed the legislation that removed the tolls. The signing was significant and historic. Significant because the bridge had been paid off ‚Äì the accrued revenue stood at $19 million (US$ in present terms) - $5 million (US$ in present terms) more than the construction bond's cost and accrued interest. It was also historic, because the tolls were removed 13 years ahead of schedule. Traffic increases For the first few decades after its opening, traffic congestion was no issue. Off of the west end of the bridge, Highway 16 (until 1964, it was signed as Primary State Highway 14-PT) transformed to a four-lane freeway from a narrow two-lane country highway. By the late 1980s, as developers began constructing housing and shopping mall projects in Gig Harbor, Highway 16 was expanded and realigned from a meandering two-lane country road to a four-lane freeway that stretched from Tacoma to Gorst. As a result, traffic congestion grew enough to where backups began occurring. In 1980, average counts were at 38,973 vehicles per day. In 1990, the figure increased to 66,573‚Äîexceeding its designed daily capacity by 6,573. Many of the backups on the bridge occurred on the east end as workers from Tacoma headed towards their homes in Gig Harbor, and those backups would stretch as far as Interstate-5 nearly away. These backups continued to get worse, and by 2000, the average daily count of traffic on the Tacoma Narrows Bridge was 88,000. This prompted the state legislature to call an advisory vote to build a new span across the Narrows. After a series of protests, both inside and outside of the courtroom, it was made official on October 5, 2002 as groundbreaking occurred for the new bridge. Lasting legacy on bridge design The failure of the 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge and the design of the 1950 Tacoma Narrows Bridge led to a number of firsts in suspension bridge design. The 1950 bridge was the first to be designed and tested in wind tunnels, and was the first suspension bridge designed and built with hydraulic motion damping devices. Maintenance, and the bridge today The 1950 Tacoma Narrows Bridge undergoes a rigorous maintenance schedule that is a year-long effort. Maintenance crews often perform replacement of steel parts, and inspect the steel cables and towers at night or at low traffic hours. Painting the bridge is also a drawn-out task. Working only during the summer months, it takes ten years to paint the span. The color of the bridge is officially known as \\"Narrows Green\\", a grayish- green hue that was the original color of the ill-fated 1940 span (called Chrome Green in a 1940 newspaper report on the final stages of Gertie's construction). The bridge has also survived several major earthquakes since its completion. The first earthquake occurred during construction on April 13, 1949, and knocked the north cable's steel saddle from the east tower. Another strong earthquake struck the region on April 29, 1965. In 1999 a series of moderate earthquakes struck the region, and the most recent earthquake is the 2001 Nisqually earthquake. Even though the bridge escaped damage in all of those earthquakes, the 1949 earthquake still has a lasting legacy hold on the span. As a result of the north cable saddle's plunge from the east tower, and resulting three-day stay in 135 feet of salt water, it now corrodes more than twice as fast as its counterparts. On the bridge's 50th anniversary in 2000, a private firm that inspected the span concluded that \\"it is one of the best for its maintenance and condition\\" and overall, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge remains one of the best maintained spans in the nation. Today, the bridge serves as the westbound span over the Narrows. Construction deaths As with its predecessor, construction deaths occurred while building the 1950 span. The first was on May 24, 1948. Robert E. Drake, who had been employed by the Woodworth Company was busy with a group of men doing cable work at the west anchorage. His death was due to the breaking of a cable on a derrick, which sent the boom directly on top of him. The second death, on April 7, 1950, was that of 36-year-old ironworker Lawrence S. Gale. His death was due to a temporary weld failure at a lower chord cross strut at panel 33. It was Gale's first day on the job building the stiffening truss work, and he had noticed a weld that didn't look right. He was going to repair the weld, when it broke. He plunged into the Narrows, along with of steel. A memorial was held on a scow. On June 6, 1950, workers were installing temporary wooden timbers for the concrete trucks pouring the deck. He stepped out to walk on a fresh stretch of timbers, and missed. Workers recalled hearing his impact with the water below sounding like an artillery piece going off. A welder, Ray Bradley was working with a crew of men installing an expansion joint on July 31, 1950. That day, it was raining heavily and Ray had reached down to grab the led direct current wire for a welding machine. According to the Pierce County Coroner's report, he suffered a heart attack, although bridgemen believed his death was the result of electrocution.

For example, an incident where a two-person crew is responding to a motor vehicle collision with three severely injured people could be considered a mass casualty incident. The general public more commonly recognizes events such as building collapses, train and bus collisions, plane crashes, earthquakes and other large-scale emergencies as mass casualty incidents. Events such as the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 and the September 11 attacks in 2001 are well-publicized examples of mass casualty incidents. The most common types of MCIs are generally caused by terrorism, mass- transportation accidents, fires or natural disasters.  Declaration  Police arrive at a mass casualty incident in Toronto A mass casualty incident will usually be declared by the first arriving unit at the scene of the incident. However, it may alternately be declared by a dispatcher, based on the information available from people who call their local emergency telephone number about the incident. A formal declaration of an MCI is usually made by an officer or chief of the agency in charge. Initially, the senior paramedic at the scene will be in charge of the incident, but as additional resources arrive, a senior officer or chief will take command, usually using an incident command system structure to form a unified command to run all aspects of the incident. In the United States, the Incident Command System is known as the National Incident Management System (NIMS). According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \\"NIMS provides the template for the management of incidents.\\" =Scene assessment= After the proper agencies have arrived, a more detailed assessment of the scene will be performed using the M.E.T.H.A.N.E method, which summarizes information necessary for responders: *M Mass incident declared *E Exact location *T Type of incident *H Hazards present *A Access and egress *N Number of casualties and severity *E Emergency services required  Agencies and responders  There are multiple agencies involved in most mass casualty incidents, which means there are many individuals that require training for these specific situations. The most common types of agencies and responders are listed below. =Emergency medical services= Ambulance busses often respond to mass-casualty incidents to help transport the large amount of patients * Certified first responders or emergency medical responders may arrive as part of local emergency medical services, or may arrive on their own. They will assist with all aspects of patient care, including triage and treatment at the scene, and transport from the scene to the hospital. * Paramedic and emergency medical technician (EMT) personnel may arrive in ambulances, in their personal vehicles, or from another agency. They will have control of all aspects of patient care, as assigned by the medical officer or incident commander. * Ground ambulances will be assigned to the transport sector to transport patients and personnel to and from the incident scene, emergency departments of hospitals, and a designated helipad. These ambulances may be municipal services, volunteer services, or from private corporations. * Air ambulances will transport patients from the scene or from designated helipads to receiving hospitals. =Fire and rescue= At night, firefighters will often utilize a Light and air unit to provide light to allow emergency responders to see properly * Firefighters will perform all initial rescue-related operations, as well as fire suppression and prevention. They may also provide medical care if they are trained and assigned to do so. They may arrive on a fire truck, in their personal vehicles, or from another agency. Many areas near airports will have automatic mutual aid agreements with airport fire departments in the event of a plane crash outside of the airport boundaries. =Public Safety= * Police officers will secure and control access to the scene, to ensure safety and smooth operations. * Utility services will ensure that utilities in the area are turned off as necessary, in order to prevent further injury or damage at the scene. *Emergency Management Agencies may assist with procuring additional equipment and supplies for the incident. Emergency Management Incident Support Teams may assist with activities such as Planning, Logistics, Operations, and Recovery. *Community Emergency Response Teams, or CERT, are civilians trained in basic emergency response and used to assist in disasters. These teams are usually trained and maintained by Emergency Management Agencies but may also be part of Fire Departments or EMS Agencies.https://www.ready.gov/community- emergency-response-team *Amateur Radio Emergency Services (ARES) or Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Services (RACES) are Amateur Radio operators trained to provide emergency communications during a disaster. Often in a disaster communication systems are overloaded or completely shut down and Amateur Radio operators use special frequencies to assist with disaster communications.http://www.arrl.org/ares-races-faq =Specialized teams= * Specialized rescue teams may be part of the local fire department; they may be associated with the state, provincial, or federal governments; or they may be privately operated teams. These teams are specialists in specific types of rescue, such as urban search and rescue (USAR) or confined space rescue. * Hazmat teams are responsible for cleaning up and neutralizing any hazardous materials at the scene. Sometimes these will be specialized CBRNE (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high-yield explosives) teams. *National Guard units have medics specifically trained in mass-casualty triage who may be called in to respond to a disaster-related incident. =Public services= * Railways and transportation agencies will be notified if an incident involves their tracks or right-of-way, or if they are required to cease operations in and through affected areas. Transportation agencies will provide buses to transport lightly injured people to the hospital. Buses can also provide shelter at the scene (for example, \\"warming buses\\") if required. * The media play an important role in keeping the general public informed about the incident and in keeping them away from the incident area. It is recommended that a Public Information Officer be assigned as the only designated responder who communicates with the media, to prevent the spread of misinformation. * Non-governmental organizations such as St. John Ambulance, the Order of Malta, the Red Cross, the Red Crescent, the Medical Reserve Corps, and the Salvation Army can provide assistance with all aspects of a mass casualty incident, including trained medical staff, vehicles, individual registration and tracking, temporary shelter, food service, and many other important services. =Hospitals= * Hospitals with emergency departments will have a mass casualty incident protocol which they initiate as soon as they are notified of an MCI in their community. They will have preparations in place to receive a massive number of casualties, like calling in more staff, pulling extra and spare equipment out of storage, and clearing non-acute patients out of the hospital. Some hospitals will send doctors to the scene of the incident to assist with triage, treatment, and transport of injured persons to the hospital.  Trauma centers  Trauma centers play a crucial role in the mass casualty incident timeline. A hospital can receive trauma center status by meeting specific criteria established by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and passing a site review. Trauma centers have levels ranging from level 1 to level 5, with each level varying in different responsibilities and resources provided: * Level 1: facilities that are able to offer complete care to the patients they receive, from initial care to seeing the individual all the way through rehabilitation. * Level 2: facilities that are able to provide almost everything a level 1 facility offers except for tertiary care, such as heart surgery. * Level 3: facilities that have the ability to provide prompt assessment of a patient's injuries and respond quickly to decide whether they can perform the surgery or need to transport the individual to a level 1 or 2 facility. * Level 4: facilities that are capable of performing advanced trauma life support, as well as providing a diagnostics assessment of the individual's injuries and transporting them to a higher level facility. * Level 5: facilities that have the bare minimum in terms of trauma centers, but still serve a vital role in the assessment stage and give the higher level facilities the proper information that they need to react correctly. This is not an exhaustive list of agencies, and many other agencies and groups of people could be involved in a mass casualty incident.  Flow  Ideally, once an MCI has been declared, a well-coordinated flow of events will occur, using three separate phases: triage, treatment, and transportation. = Triage = The first-arriving crew will conduct triage. Pre-hospital emergency triage generally consists of a check for immediate life-threatening concerns, usually lasting no more than one minute per patient. In North America, the START system (simple triage and rapid treatment) is the most common and is considered the easiest to use. Using START, the medical responder assigns each patient to one of four color-coded triage levels, based on their breathing, circulation, and mental status. The triage levels are: * ': Patients who have major life-threatening injuries, but are salvageable given the resources available * ': Patients who have non-life-threatening injuries, but are unable to walk or exhibit an altered mental status * ': Patients who are able to ambulate out of the incident area to a treatment area * ': Used for victims who are dead, or whose injuries make survival unlikely. Triage personnel do not conduct treatment, with the exception of: * Airway maneuvers; * Tourniquets for life-threatening hemorrhage; and * Where allowed by local protocols, needle decompressions for tension pneumothoraces Generally, a small group of responders, usually the first two or three crews on scene, can complete triage. When responding to a chemical, biological, or radiological incident, the first-arriving crew must establish safety zones prior to entering the scene. Safety zones include: * The hot zone: The contaminated area * The warm zone: The area where HazMat specialists will decontaminate patients and fellow responders * The cold zone: The safe zone, where any personnel who are not specially trained in HazMat and do not have chemical or biological protection gear must remain at all times. Depending on the contaminant, the cold zone should be roughly 200‚Äì300 yards from the incident, uphill and upwind. It should also be at least 50 yards uphill and upwind from the warm zone. These zones should be clearly identified and with engineer tapes, lights, or cones. All responders and patients must leave the hot zone in designated pathways into the warm zone where they will be decontaminated. A designated officer should be posted at the hot zone and warm zone to make sure all contaminated personal are treated and decontaminated before entering the cold zone. = Treatment = Once casualties have been triaged, they can be moved to appropriate treatment areas. Unless a patient is green-tagged and ambulatory, litter bearers will have to transport patients from the incident scene to safer treatment areas located nearby. These treatment areas must always be within walking distance, and will be staffed by appropriate numbers of properly certified medical personnel and support people. The litter bearers do not have to be advanced medical personnel; their role is to simply place casualties onto carrying devices and transport them to the appropriate treatment area. Casualties should be transported in order of treatment priority: red-tagged patients first, followed by yellow-tagged, then green- tagged, and finally black-tagged. Each colored triage category will have its own treatment area. Treatment areas are often defined by colored tarpaulins, flagging tape, signs, or tents. Upon arrival in the treatment area, the casualties are re-assessed and they are treated with the goal of stabilizing them until they can be transported to hospitals; transported to the morgue or medical examiner's office; or released.  On-site morgue  Some mass- casualty incidents require an on-site morgue, for several reasons: * To await transfer of these victims to a permanent morgue; * When the deceased must be removed to access injured victims; * To keep the deceased out of public sight and prevent heightening distress, fear, or panic in an already emotionally- charged scene Most often, on-site morgues are set up on the far side of the incident, is in an enclosed area such as a temporary tent or nearby building. =Transport= The final stage in the pre-hospital management of a mass- casualty incident is the transport of casualties to hospitals for more definitive care. If the number of ambulances available is inadequate, other vehicles may transport patients, such as police cars, firetrucks, air ambulances, transit buses, or personal vehicles. As with treatment, transport priority is determined based on the severity of the patient's injuries. Usually, the most seriously injured are transported first, with the least serious transported only after all the critical patients have been transported. However, in an effort to remove as many lightly injured civilians as possible, an incident commander may choose to have those least seriously injured transported to local hospitals or interim-care centers in order to provide more room for emergency personnel to work. It is also possible that lightly-injured casualties will be transported first when access to those who are more severely injured will be delayed due to heavy or difficult rescue efforts.  Definitive care  The care that is rendered at the scene of an MCI is usually only temporary and is designed to stabilize the casualties until they can receive more definitive care at a hospital or an interim-care centre. = Interim-care centre = An interim-care centre is a temporary treatment centre which allows for the assessment and treatment of patients until they can either be discharged or transported to a hospital. These are often placed in gymnasiums, schools, arenas, community centres, hotels, and or other locations that can support a field hospital setup. Permanent buildings are preferred to tents as they provide shelter, power, and running water, but many governments maintain complete field hospital setups that can be deployed anywhere within their jurisdiction within 12‚Äì24 hours. While full field hospitals require a significant amount of time to deploy (in relation to the length of most incidents), emergency personnel can set up temporary interim- care centres fairly quickly if needed using the personnel and resources they have on-hand. These centres are usually staffed by a combination of doctors, nurses, paramedics/emergency medical technicians, first responders, and social workers (for example, from the Red Cross), who work to get families reunited after a disaster. = Mass casualty event = Generally, in the healthcare field, the term \\"mass casualty event\\" (MCE) is used when hospital resources are overwhelmed by the number or severity of casualties. During these incidents, hospitals can discharge all fit patients, dedicate more resources to the emergency department, and expand their intensive care unit to accommodate anticipated long-term care needs. While up to 80% of victims will be transported from the scene to hospitals, others who are less injured might walk themselves to these facilities and increase the load at the closest facility to the incident. MCEs can include epidemics, chemical emergencies, mass shootings, and natural disasters like weather.  Demobilization  The final product of an MCI that happens to link up with the M.E.T.H.A.N.E. method is the act of demobilization which is crucial to the entire process. The demobilization process has to be in place from the beginning, once an area has been mobilized. This is critical, as a mass casualty incident can get out of hand quickly. Having everything planned out step-by-step can alleviate these concerns and help cover for the unexpected. The demobilization process also gives the local community and the corresponding agencies an idea for how long their city and specific areas will be consumed with emergency personnel and essentially blocked off. In many events, such as Hurricane Katrina, the demobilization process is not taken into account from the beginning. As a result, the process goes on much longer than necessary, which exacerbates financial costs, and puts a burden on local emergency and law enforcement services to uphold their everyday duties while also maintaining control of the mass casualty incident.

Fleet founded and led several corporations, including Consolidated Aircraft. Birth and early career Fleet was born on March 6, 1887, to Lillian Waite and David Fleet in Montesano, Washington. The Fleets were a prosperous family; David Fleet was city engineer and county auditor for Montesano, and owned large tracts of land in the Washington Territory. He also served as the city clerk. Reuben grew up in Grays Harbor, Washington. The Panic of 1893 wiped out the land holdings of the Fleets and the family lived in much diminished conditions from the time Reuben was six until he was thirteen. At 15, Fleet attended Culver Military Academy where his uncle, Alexander Fleet, was superintendent. He spent his fourth and final year at the academy as the editor-in-chief of the cadet newspaper, the C.M.A. Vedette. Culver provided the equivalent of an associate degree, and after his graduation Fleet intended to continue his education at Stanford University. Deciding against going to Stanford immediately, in 1907 Fleet returned home, where he took the state teachers examination and began teaching all grades from first through eighth. After a number of months, Fleet set himself up as a realtor and resigned from teaching. It was also during this time that Fleet joined the Washington National Guard, as captain. In 1908, with a loan from Montesano State Bank for $1500, Fleet began investing in local real estate, which would eventually culminate in Fleet owning large tracts of timberland which he would subdivide and parcel out, often for railroad right-of-way or logging, for substantial profit. In March 1911, Fleet, a captain of a National Guard company, was ordered with his men to quell a civil disturbance organized by the Industrial Workers of the World, a militant labor organization. Later, from April through May Fleet and three other officers were assigned to San Diego, California, to keep track of the agitators who had moved south from Washington and Oregon, heading to Mexico. So impressed was Fleet with San Diego and its climate that he told himself that he would arrange to have his business in San Diego if he could. The promise was kept 24 years later when he relocated the Consolidated plant to San Diego from Buffalo, New York Army career Anticipating the entry of the United States into World War I Fleet closed his office in March 1917 and reported to the training facility of the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps, United States Army, in San Diego. Commissioned in the Army as a major, Fleet graduated Junior Military Aviator No. 74. He was then assigned as acting commanding officer of the 18th Aero Squadron, Training. During the war in Europe Fleet was the executive officer for Flying Training, Signal Corps Aviation Section, stationed in Washington, D.C., with temporary duty in England. His commanding officer was Colonel 'Hap' Arnold. In May 1918 Fleet was tasked with setting up the first scheduled U. S. Air Mail between New York and Washington, D.C., the Aerial Mail Service being jointly operated by the Department of War and U.S. Post Office Department. Fleet was appointed Officer-in-Charge of the Aerial Mail Service in addition to his duties as executive officer for Flying Training. Fleet successfully petitioned President Wilson personally to suspend the expansion of the air mail service to Boston until better equipment and facilities were created. Fleet was in charge of the airmail service in 1918 when the famous 24-cent Inverted Jenny postage stamp was printed in error. It became one of the rarest collector stamps of United States postage. In 2013 the United States Postal Service commemorated this issue by printing 2,182,000 Souvenir sheets. Each had six of the stamps (repriced at $2) surrounded by period images. Dressed as a World War One-era aviator, Fleet appears in the lower left quadrant of the sheet. Fleet's next assignment was as the Army Air Service's chief aviation contracting officer, part of the Engineering Division, based at McCook Field. There he played key roles in the development of the turbocharger for aero applications and the testing of a number of other aviation innovations, including the Loening PW-2A, the first American pursuit monoplane, and the de Bothezat helicopter. Fleet performed some of the flight testing himself. Fleet was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his service at McCook Field. With post-war budgets slashed and commissioned officers being reduced one rank Fleet felt he'd gone as far as he could in military aviation. On 30 November 1922, Thanksgiving Day, Fleet, his superior officer and the chief of the Power Plant Section announced to the press that they were resigning. Consolidated years Upon resigning his commission Fleet accepted a position with Gallaudet Aircraft Company. Fleet arranged the merger between Gallaudet Aircraft Company and Dayton-Wright Company to create his own company, Consolidated, in 1923. He hired Isaac Machlin Laddon, who had been in charge of design of heavy aircraft at McCook Field. One of his first goals was to secure the contract to design a twin-engine night bomber for the Army. Teaming with Sikorsky, they failed to win the competition with their S-37 design. Consolidated then went on to a long line of successful designs and lucrative contracts for seaplanes for the Navy. Starting with their XPY-1 of 1928, the company's string of successes culminated in one of the most numerous and successful seaplanes, the Consolidated PBY Catalina. Exploiting Fleet's experience in Army flight training, Consolidated produced a popular military training aircraft, the PT-11 (Consolidated Model 21) primary/advanced trainer. Leading Consolidated, Fleet founded or acquired a number of subsidiaries, including Fleet Aircraft to market civilian designs, Tonawanda Products Corporation to supply components, and Hall-Aluminum Aircraft Corporation. Among the companies acquired by Fleet during time was the Thomas-Morse Aircraft which was failing yet had outstanding contracts to deliver. Fleet selected San Diego, California to relocate Consolidated from Buffalo, New York, where winter weather restricted seaplane operations. The move occurred in 1935. In November, 1941 Fleet elected to sell a majority of his shares in Consolidated to Vultee Aircraft. The resulting company, Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation, became known as Convair.\\"Vultee.\\" centennialofflight.net, 2003. Retrieved: 26 August 2010. He continued on in the role of adviser and consultant for five more years. He also became a private consultant for Franklin D. Roosevelt. Consolidated went on to become a key supplier of heavy bombers with the widely produced B-24 Liberator playing a key role in the Allied strategic bombing campaigns, and the Convair B-36‚Äîthe world's largest piston-engined bomber‚Äîfilling a crucial gap in the Cold War years until jet-powered bombers became widely available. In August 1946, Fleet and his sister, Lillian, bought a parcel of land in Montesano and donated it to the city for use as a park named in honor of their parents. The city subsequently renamed Second Street to Fleet Street in their honor.The Vidette, August 29, 1946 Retirement and philanthropy Leaving Consolidated, Fleet divided his time between his landmark home in Point Loma, California, the \\"Spanish Castle,\\" and his residence in Palm Springs, California. During this time Fleet served on the California State Highway Commission. He was also active in the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences (IAS), the professional society for aeronautical engineers and researchers in related fields. IAS was founded in 1932 and was the predecessor of today's AIAA. In 1961 Fleet founded the San Diego Aerospace Museum to commemorate President Kennedy's commitment to land a man on the moon within this decade. In 1965 Fleet was invested in the International Aerospace Hall of Fame, and his portrait now hangs along with the other inductees' in the Hall of Fame's gallery within the San Diego Air and Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. . In 1967, Fleet's son, Sandy, founded the Fotomat Corporation. In the early 1970s, Fleet largely funded construction of The Bishop Center for Performing Arts at Grays Harbor College in Aberdeen, Washington, in honor of E. K. \\"Ned\\" and Lillian Fleet Bishop. Lillian was Fleet's sister, and \\"Ned\\" Bishop, a logging tycoon in western Washington state, was an early investor in Consolidated Aircraft. The Bishops left their fortune to a foundation that funds operation of the Bishop Center. The Reuben H. Fleet Space Theatre, now the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center, was established in San Diego in 1973 after an initial gift by his son Preston Fleet and the rest of the Fleet family. It was the first science museum to combine interactive science exhibits with a planetarium and very large screen theater based on the IMAX film format, setting the pattern that most major science museums have since adopted. Personal life Fleet married Elizabeth Girton on April 29, 1908, and they settled in Montesano, Washington. They had two children, Phyllis Fleet and David Girton Fleet; David later became an executive with Consolidated and a real estate developer, creator of the upscale Fleetridge neighborhood in San Diego. Fleet and Elizabeth were divorced in 1920. In 1931 he married Dorothy Mitchell, and they had three children, Preston \\"Sandy\\" Fleet, Dorothy Fleet, and Nancy Fleet. Preston Fleet went on to found the Fotomat Corporation. Fleet and Dorothy were divorced in 1944. He married Eva May VanDenburgh in 1947. Fleet died in San Diego, California, on October 29, 1975, at age 88 from injuries related to a fall.

History  Approval was given in August 1947D.J. Goodspeed, \\"A History of the Defence Research Board of Canada\\", 1 Jan 1958 for the construction of 60 prefabricated housing units for scientists, technologists, and military personnel working at the Suffield Experimental Station at a site named after the Honourable J. L. Ralston. Due to delays,Annual Report of the Chairman, Defence Research Board, September, 1951 major construction did not complete until 1953. In June 1969, Dr. Perry of the Defence Research Establishment Suffield (DRES) informed the tenants of the Crown village that the Defence Research Board was considering the possibility of closing Ralston due to the financial situation of the federal government at the time.\\"Crown village facing closure\\", The Medicine Hat News, 16 June 1969 A decision was to be reached in September or October of that year. The decision would affect approximately 150 families, the bowling alley, theatre, store, swimming pool and elementary school. At the time, of the 200 homes, approximately 40 to 50 were vacant. A committee was looking at the cost saving options that would be phased in over two years. One option was to move Ralston's houses to Medicine Hat and discussions were under way with the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) concerning the possibility setting up new housing in Medicine Hat. In the letter given to the occupants of Ralston's houses, Dr. Perry stated \\"I cannot emphasize too strongly that a decision to close the village, if adopted, will not in any way imply a change in the decision already made to continue the program and operation of DRES at the level established last fall, and I can assure you that any final action will be taken so as to minimize the possible hardships which may arise.\\" In April 1970, Ralston was saved from closure when Dr. Perry released that the Defence Research Board was \\"very favorably inclined towards incorporation\\" in a private letter to a citizen committee.\\"DRB favors Ralston incorporation\\", The Medicine Hat News, 14 April 1970 The formal announcement was to be made publicly by L√©o Cadieux, Minister of National Defence. The citizen committee, chaired by Dr. James Lipp, was \\"very happy with the information. Maybe with luck we'll have it done (incorporated) this year.\\" A site survey of Ralston was undertaken and the plan registered with the province. Negotiations ensued with the province in order to ensure Ralston would be debt-free and that all essential road, power and water services would remain intact. A survey of Ralston's tenants indicated that a majority of them were willing to purchase their houses that had already been assessed for value and taxation. The homes and lots would be bought through the CMHC for an average price of $4,000. In addition, a number of farm families in the Jenner/Iddesleigh area expressed interest in purchasing lots and houses. On August 3, 1971, Agriculture Minister H.A.

Fundaci√≥n ANAR in SpainResoluci√≥n SETSI, 31 March/2010 and Missing People in the UK in 2010. Purpose A European wide number was reserved by the European Commission for a variety of reasons. First the phenomenon of missing children is becoming increasingly a cross-border problem as the Schengen area is expanding. Secondly swift action in cases of disappearance is of vital importance, as a report from the United States' Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention suggests that 76.2% of children who are murdered after having been abducted are dead within the first three hours of disappearance. Furthermore parents need the support of an organisation specialised in dealing with these cases. And finally there is a need to communicate about a missing child beyond national borders.  History  The development of an emergency number for missing children that can be dialled anywhere in Europe has been on top of the agenda of Missing Children Europe, the NGO behind the number, since 2005. On 15 February 2007, the European Commission recognised the need for such a Europe-wide effort and published a document requesting the member states to reserve 116 000 as the number for missing children.Commission Decision 2007/116/EC On 25 May 2009, the number was launched in nine member states of Missing Children Europe. It is expected that other Member States will also implement the number, as implementation takes place at a national level.

The Aequalis Choir was one of the choirs that represented Venezuela at the Songbird Project, organized by Erkki Pohjola. The Aequalis Foundation The Aequalis Foundation is a non-profit organization that was set up by Ana Mar√≠a Raga in 2001. It is dedicated to investigation and training in music, the promotion of music, in particular the practice of choral music as a tool of artistic and human development, enhancing the quality of life no matter at what stage in life. Through the Foundation, Raga promotes the right every person has to discover the music inside of oneself and its transformative powers. She teaches the art form, promoting the appreciation of every day beauty. This is favorable to health, the development of intelligence. It is a vehicle for socialization and the formation of the values of cohabitation and social integration; in short, it is about the positive impact of music on the quality of life as much on the individual as on the collective level. Raga conceives and offers training workshops for choir conductors and music teachers. She works to disseminate and create new choral repertoire, develop projects that enhance audience appreciation and musical expression. Her programs and activities are based on choral practice of children, young people and seniors, using strategies that enhance cognitive capabilities, psychomotor activities, stimulate different dimensions of intelligence and favor socialization. The Aequalis Foundation has offered choral activities in places where music can provide tools for social reinsertion and integration. An example is the women penitentiary (INOF ‚Äì Instituto Nacional de Orientaci√≥n Femenina) in Los Teques where the foundation initiated the creation of prison orchestras and choirs. This project has since been assumed by FundaMusical Bol√≠var (former FESNOJIV) and extended to other prisons. Since its creation, the foundation has promoted the set-up of children and youth choirs achieving national and international recognition. Currently the Foundation manages the Aequalis Aurea (female voices) and the Humboldt School Choir Project (for children and youth from 4 to 17 years old). The latter one constitutes the platform for the Intercollegiate Choir Festival that has been organized since 2005 pursuing greater visibility for and promotion of choral practice that takes place in schools. Publications Ana Mar√≠a Raga's creative work as a composer and arranger is centered on choral music. Some of her work has been published by Hinshaw Music, Inc. and √âditions √Ä Coeur Joie. She has collaborated with Sounds in Europe, a publication of the European Music Council (Regional Group of the International Music Council) and with La Circular, a publication of the Secretariat for Children Choirs of Catalonia. Furthermore, she maintains her own blog, Sala de Ensayo, with articles and information about the choral world.

Lanceray was associated with Mir Iskusstva art circle and was a proponent of Russian neoclassical revival school. Biography Lanceray was a son of sculptor Eugene Lanceray (senior, 1848‚Äì1886) and Yekaterina Benois (daughter of architect Nikolay Benois). Father died when Nikolay was six; he and five his siblings were raised by the Benois family and lived most of their childhood at grandfather's Saint Petersburg place. Lanceray completed high school in 1898 and joined the Imperial Academy of Arts, where his illustrious uncle Leon Benois chaired one of three architectural workshops.Vityazeva, Modzalevskaya, p. 9 Lanceray graduated from the Academy in 1904. In 1903 Lanceray, Vladimir Shchuko and Ludwig Shroeter settled on a long survey tour of Pskov and Novgorod regions; Mir Iskusstva published Vandalism in Novgorod and Pskov governorates (–í–∞–Ω–¥–∞–ª–∏–∑–º –≤ –ù–æ–≤–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—Å–∫–æ–π –∏ –ü—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –≥—É–±–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—è—Ö) by Lanceray and Schuko in 1907. He worked as a practical architect in Moscow and as restorator in Saint Petersburg. Soon, however, he quit construction for historical studies of Russian Enlightenment, and co-authored Tsarskoye Selo in the reigh of Elizabeth, contributing over 200 graphical sheets.Vityazeva, Modzalevskaya, p. 11 He was a regular author of Starye Gody magazine that published his 1911 biography of Andreyan Zakharov and 1912‚Äì1913 essays on Gatchina Palace and Tsarskoye Selo. Lanceray continued collecting material on neoclassical architects, primarily Brenna, Cameron and Zakharov, until his arrest in 1931. In 1925‚Äì1928 Lanceray and French architect Jessel worked on redesigning ship interiors at Northern Wharf. This collaboration was used by OGPU as a pretext for arresting both artists.Vityazeva, Modzalevskaya, p. 14 Lanceray was arrested on March 2, 1931, charged with \\"espionage for France\\" and sentenced to death, commuted to 10 years of hard labor. Instead of GULAG camps, he ended up in a Leningrad- based architectural sharashka. From July 1931 to June 1935 Lanceray was involved in numerous NKVD-sponsored projects; he is credited with designing interiors of coast guard ships, Moscow Kremlin offices, aluminum smelters and apartment blocks in Moscow and Leningrad. Lanceray's prison drafts, signed in his own name, participated in public architectural contests, as if the architect was still free.Vityazeva, Modzalevskaya, p. 15 Isaac Brodsky, Ivan Fomin, Alexey Shchusev, Vladimir Shchuko and other influential artists pleaded in favor of Lanceray, and he was released in August 1935. Freedom spelled bitter dissatisfaction to Lanceray: while he was behind bars, the Academy of Architecture commissioned biographies of Cameron and Zakharov to other writers. He still managed to sign a contract for a biography of Vincenzo Brenna.Vityazeva, Modzalevskaya, p. 16 For three following years Lanceray chaired an architectural workshop on site of Experimental Medicine Institute (Leningrad), collecting pieces of information for his book on Brenna. He was regularly harassed by NKVD searches and interrogations. In May 1938 Lanceray sent the final version of Vincenzo Brenna to the publisher; ten days later he was arrested, again for espionage charges. Lanceray broke down under torture and pleaded guilty; this time, he was sentenced for five years in Kotlas.Vityazeva, Modzalevskaya, p. 20 In 1941 the Kotlas camp was herded, on foot, to Moscow;Vityazeva, Modzalevskaya, p. 21 fellow inmates carried ailing Lanceray on their shoulders. The foot march was followed with rail transport to Saratov; there, Lanceray suffered a heart attack and died on May 6, 1942.Vityazeva, Modzalevskaya, p. 22 Espionage sentences against Lanceray were lifted posthumously in 1957; first edition of Vincenzo Brenna was published in 2006.Vityazeva, Modzalevskaya, p. 23 References Sources * Vityazeva, V.

Howard Kitching, was an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He served in the cavalry, artillery and infantry in the Army of the Potomac and Army of the Shenandoah. He received a posthumous promotion to brevet brigadier general after being mortally wounded at the Battle of Cedar Creek. Early life and family Kitching was born July 16, 1838 in New York City (some sources say 1840). His father was merchant John Benjamin Kitching (1818‚Äì1887) and mother was Maria Bradner. Gives 1840 as birth year, but says he was 26 in 1864, consistent with birth year of 1838 given in other sources. His father, born in England, was one of the first investors in technology such as the ships of John Ericsson, the telegraph and the transatlantic telegraph cable. He married Harriet Brittan Ripley (a descendant of the New England Dwight family) on July 18, 1860. They had two children: John Howard Kitching, Jr. born September 27, 1861, and Edith Howard Kitching born November 13, 1864. Civil War service At the outbreak of the war, Kitching volunteered in the New York cavalry but was soon made a captain in the 2nd New York Artillery. In September 1862 he became lieutenant colonel of the 135th New York Infantry which was re-designated the 6th New York Heavy Artillery (nicknamed the Anthony Wayne Guard) a few weeks later.Civil War Archive Kitching spent most of the war up to this point in garrison duty along the upper Potomac River. The regiment's colonel, William H. Morris, was promoted to brigadier general in November 1862 and on April 26, 1863 Kitching was appointed colonel. His regiment joined the Army of the Potomac during the final stages of the Gettysburg Campaign following the battle of Gettysburg. During the Fall of 1863 and Winter 1864 Kitching briefly commanded the Army of the Potomac's ammunition train and artillery reserve. =Overland Campaign= At the battle of the Wilderness Kitching commanded a heavy artillery brigade in the Army of the Potomac's artillery reserve. Following the battle the artillery reserve was divided among the infantry corps and Kitching's brigade was assigned to the V Corps and fought with that corps at Spotsylvania. Kitching's artillery brigade was converted to infantry and assigned to the 3rd Division, V Corps at Cold Harbor and became the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, V Corps at Petersburg.Eicher p.336 Kitching and the 6th New York Heavy Artillery were transferred to the Washington defenses where he took part in the battle of Fort Stevens. Following the battle he commanded a brigade in the Washington defenses. =Shenandoah Valley Campaign= During Philip H. Sheridan's Valley Campaign, Kitching's command was transferred to the Army of the Shenandoah with the addition of other miscellaneous units and was known as Kitching's Provisional Division.Other than having roughly 1,000 soldiers in the division, exact composition is unknown. Source: Cedar Creek Battlefield His division was attached to George Crook's VIII Corps just days before the battle of Cedar Creek. At Cedar Creek, Confederate General John B. Gordon surprised the Union army in an early morning attack. Just as Rutherford B. Hayes, commanding a neighboring Union division, assured Kitching that his men would hold, Hayes' division was hit by Gordon's attack and broke for the rear.Lewis p.146 Before the Confederates even reached Kitching's line, his troops also began to retreat. Kitching himself was forced to leave the field after receiving a severe wound in his foot.Lewis p.147 As a result he was forced to leave the army and return home to recover. However on January 11, 1865 Kitching died as a result of his foot wound at his home in Dobbs Ferry, New York.

Lincoln Castle where Maud was besieged by the forces of King Stephen in 1141 Marriage and issue Sometime before 1141, possibly as early as 1135, Matilda married Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester, and was accorded the title of Countess of Chester. Her husband had considerable autonomy in his palatine earldom. In January 1141, Earl Ranulf and Countess Matilda were at Lincoln Castle when it was besieged by the forces of King Stephen of England. The following month, a relief army loyal to Empress Matilda and led by her father Robert earl of Gloucester defeated and captured the king in the fierce fighting, later known as the First Battle of Lincoln. In return for his help in repelling the king's troops, the countess's father compelled her husband to swear fealty to Empress Matilda, who was Earl Robert's half-sister.

Biography Harker was born at Havelock North and attended Napier Boys' High School. He graduated in 1915 from the Victoria College (now Victoria University of Wellington) with an LLB. He served in World War I in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force departing 13 June 1918 and rising to the rank of Company Sergeant Major. He returned in August 1919 and in that year bought a share of the law partnership in Waipawa that is now McKay Mackie. He was Mayor of Waipawa and held offices in both the Returned Services Association and the Chamber of Commerce. In 1936 and 1937 he represented the abortionist Isabel Annie Aves, who was tried four times for 'using an instrument with the intent to procure a miscarriage.' Neither the first trial in Napier in August 1936 nor the retrials in Wellington in October 1936, December 1936 and February 1937 resulted in the jury reaching a verdict. Harker's defence rested on lack of direct evidence; none of the women were gave evidence and the crown prosecutor relied on circumstantial evidence. In 1938 he also defended Colin Herbert Hercock who shot Aves after her return to the Hawkes Bay, getting him convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter rather than murder and subsequently getting his prison term reduced. He represented the Hawke's Bay electorates of Waipawa from a to 1946, and then Hawke's Bay from 1946 to 1963, when he retired. His maiden speech to the house concerned the Small Farms Amendment Bill which dealt with the settlement and rehabilitation of returned soldiers. He was Chairman of Committees from 1950 to 1957. In the 1964 Queen's Birthday Honours, Harker was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for public services. He died on 4 November 1970.

His poker playing days, however, came to an end in 2004 when he lost his vision to a hereditary dystrophy known as retinitis pigmentosa.

A few weeks later Donna called Hal to inform him that an old friend and Mirage Poker Room Shift Manager, Dennis Jackson was dying of cancer. She told him that the Mirage was going to have a charity tournament to raise money for Dennis and wanted to know if Hal would play. At first Hal declined, but Donna insisted stating that he could have a \\"reader\\" tell him what the cards were. After the tournament, Donna told Hal that not only was he always welcome at the Mirage, but that they would make him \\"as comfortable as possible.\\" World Series of Poker Shortly before the 2007 World Series of Poker, Hal contacted Harrah's Casino to see if he would be allowed to participate in the tournament with a reader. According to tournament rules, players are not allowed to confer or be helped by others. Harrah's management told him that he would not be allowed to have assistance at the table, to which Hal reportedly told them, \\"I'm not trying to give you trouble, but I could probably make more money suing you than playing in the tournament.\\" Hal also mentioned William Rockwell, a player without arms whose mother had assisted him at the 2005 WSOP. Harrah's Casino quickly relented and agreed to allow Hal to participate with a reader. With the help of Jo Adair, a poker dealer, Hal competed at the 2007 WSOP. Jo would whisper Hal's cards and the community cards into Hal's ear. Hal returned to the 2008 WSOP, with a new reader, where he \\"was a favorite of ESPN's television cameras.\\" By the time Hal was knocked out of the 2008 tournament everybody was familiar with his story.

Patrick Collinson calls him presbyterian by conviction, but moderate in his views.Patrick Collinson, The Elizabethan Puritan Movement (1982), p. 456. Life He was born at Kirkby Stephen in Westmoreland in 1544 and entered St. John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. 1564, and, on 21 March 1567, was elected a Fellow. In 1568, he proceeded M.A. and, in 1576, took his degree as B.D. He became noted as a controversialist, particularly as a writer against the teaching of Henry Nicholis and the Family of Love. In 1576, he preached against their doctrines at Paul's Cross. On 13 August 1579, he was presented by Sir William Spring to the rectory of Cockfield, Suffolk, in succession to Richard Longworth, and continued to hold the living for the rest of his life. Under the patronage of the Spring family, Cockfield became a centre of Puritan doctrine. In May 1582, an assembly of about 60 clergymen from Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire met in Cockfield Church to confer about the Prayer Book, clerical dress, and customs.Collinson, p. 218. St. John's College also was, at that time, noted for its leanings to Puritanism; Knewstub was a follower of Thomas Cartwright and a friend of Adam Winthrop, John Winthrop's father.Francis J. Bremer, John Winthrop: America's forgotten founding father (2003), p. 48. Knewstub was a strong candidate in 1595 to succeed William Whitaker as Master of St John's, though Richard Clayton was elected. At the conference in Hampton Court in 1604, he appeared as one of the four ministers deputed to oppose conformity. He took especial exception to the use of the sign of the cross in baptism and also to the surplice. Knewstub died at Cockfield, where he was buried 31 May 1624. His epitaph, which has disappeared from his place of interment, has been preserved by Francis Peck.Desiderata Curiosa, p. 216. He does not appear to have been married. Works The Evangelium Regni of Henry Nicholis, composed originally in German, had been translated into Latin and, in 1579, Knewstub translated a large portion of the Latin version into English, with comments in which he unsparingly denounced the tenets advanced. The work was dedicated to Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, and the contents of the volume show that Knewstub was, by this time, well known at court. His Lectures ‚Ä¶ upon the twentieth Chapter of Exodus of 1577 had been dedicated to Dudley‚Äôs wife Anne.

Smith served as leader of the Wildrose Party from October 2009 to December 17, 2014 when she resigned to cross the floor and join the governing Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta caucus.\\"9 Wildrose MLAs, including Danielle Smith, cross to Alberta Tories\\". CBC News, December 17, 2014. She represented the riding of Highwood in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. On March 28, 2015, she lost the PC nomination for Highwood to Okotoks Councillor Carrie Fischer. Fischer went on to be defeated by Wildrose candidate Wayne Anderson in the 2015 General Election. Prior to being elected leader of the Wildrose Party, Smith was the director of provincial affairs for Alberta with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. She has also worked as a journalist in print, radio and television. As leader, Smith was instrumental in the growth of the Wildrose Party, taking a party that lacked official party status to one that formed the Official Opposition within three years. Background Danielle Smith was born in Calgary on April 1, 1971, and is the second of five children. Her paternal great-grandfather was Philipus Kolodnicki, a Ukrainian immigrant whose name was anglicized to \\"Philip Smith\\" upon his arrival in Canada in 1915. Growing up, her family lived in subsidized housing. Smith attended the University of Calgary and acquired a Bachelor of Arts in English and in economics. While at university she was active with the federal and provincial Progressive Conservatives and won the presidency of the campus PC club. Smith's work in public policy began with a one-year internship with the Fraser Institute. Smith wed her second husband David Moretta, a former executive producer with Sun Media, in 2006. At the age of 27, in 1998, Smith entered politics when she ran for the board of trustees of the Calgary Board of Education. She won, but less than a year later, the chairwoman complained that the board had become dysfunctional. In response, provincial Minister of Learning Lyle Oberg dismissed the entire board. Years later, Smith acknowledged she had been far too strident during her tenure as a board trustee and said the experience taught her to be more tolerant of those with whom she disagreed. Subsequently, Smith pursued work as an advocate for ranchers, farmers and other rural land owners with the Alberta Property Rights Initiative and the Canadian Property Rights Research Institute. After her time as a board trustee Smith joined the Calgary Herald as a columnist with the editorial board. She then went on to succeed Charles Adler as host of the national current affairs program Global Sunday, a Sunday-afternoon interview show on Global Television. She also hosted two talk radio programs focused on health policy and property rights. In 2004, Smith was named one of Calgary's \\"Top 40 Under 40\\". In September 2006, she co-hosted the Calgary Congress, a national assembly of citizens and economic and constitutional specialists to consider basic federal reforms for Canada. Smith was hired by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business in 2006, becoming provincial director for Alberta. She is also a past member of the Girl Guides of Canada and was featured in a 2013 museum exhibit about prominent Girl Guides at the Red Deer Museum and Art Gallery. Politics Smith supported Ted Morton in the 2006 PC leadership election. Morton lost to the more centrist Ed Stelmach and Smith became increasingly disillusioned with what she claims were Stelmach's \\"free- spending ways\\". Smith cites the 2008 provincial budget as a turning point where she determined that Stelmach's government had 'lost its way'. = Party leadership = Danielle Smith answers questions from the media after the release of the 2013 provincial budget. Smith quit the PC party in 2009 and joined the Wildrose Alliance. The Tories were unnerved enough by Smith's defection that they sent MLA Rob Anderson, one of the more fiscally conservative members of their caucus, to talk Smith out of it. Years later, Smith recalled that Anderson told her that despite the Tories' reckless spending and unwillingness to listen to the backbench, they were the only credible centre-right party in the province. Smith refused to stay, saying that there was no hope of restoring Alberta to fiscal sanity under the Tories, and that the Wildrose was the only credible chance at electing a fiscally conservative government. As far as she was concerned, she told Anderson, \\"This (Tory) government is beyond redemption. It's out of control.\\"Rise And Fall Of Alberta Wildrose Party Inextricably Linked To Danielle Smith. Canadian Press, 2014-12-17. Later that year, Smith was recruited by Wildrose officials to run for the leadership of the party. During the course of the leadership campaign outgoing leader Paul Hinman was victorious in a by-election in the riding of Calgary-Glenmore. His win meant he was one of four in the Wildrose caucus; by the time Smith was elected leader on October 17, 2009, support for the party had quadrupled since the 2008 election. After Smith was elected leader, support for the Wildrose Party continued to grow. Smith convinced three PCs who served in government to cross the floor to join the Wildrose Party: Rob Anderson and Heather Forsyth, and later Guy Boutiller. = 2012 election = For most of the time before the 2012 provincial election, it appeared that Smith was poised to become the first woman to lead a party to victory in an Alberta election. Numerous polls indicated that the Wildrose Party could defeat the governing Progressive Conservatives, who were also led by a woman, Premier Alison Redford. The PCs had governed the province since 1971, the second-longest unbroken run in government at the provincial level. The Wildrose Party won 17 seats on 34.3% of the popular vote, and took over Official Opposition status from the Alberta Liberal Party. Smith was elected to the Legislature from Highwood, just south of Calgary, on the same day, defeating John Barlow, editor of the Okotoks Western Wheel. Political pundits suggested Wildrose lost their early polling lead over the Progressive Conservatives due to Smith's defence of two Wildrose candidates who had made controversial remarks. Allan Hunsperger, running in an Edmonton riding, had written a blog post claiming that gays would end up in a \\"lake of fire\\" if they did not renounce their lifestyle. Ron Leech had claimed he would have a leg up on the competition in his Calgary riding because he was white. According to the National Post, Hunsperger and Leech's extreme views, as well as Smith's refusal to condemn them, cost her a chance of unseating Redford. Ultimately, Wildrose was denied victory mainly because it was unable to get any foothold in the urban areas. It won only two seats in Calgary and was completely shut out in Edmonton. In appraising the election results at the Wildrose 2012 annual general meeting, Smith advocated freezing out candidates who cannot respectfully communicate their views in future elections. Smith asked members to adopt a forward-looking policy platform for the next election. =Rejoining the Progressive Conservative Party= Smith and Jim Prentice announcing that she and eight other Wildrose MLAs would be crossing the floor to join the Progressive Conservatives. After Redford was forced out of politics in the spring of 2014 due to allegations of corruption, Smith's Wildrose party was initially the major beneficiary. However, this momentum stalled when former federal cabinet minister Jim Prentice became PC leader and premier. Under Prentice, the PCs swept four by-elections in October. Smith was dealt a second blow at the Wildrose annual general meeting, when an anti- discrimination resolution that she strongly supported was voted down while she was out of the room.Danielle Smith speaks out on defection to the Tories. CBC News, 2014-12-17. On December 17, 2014, Smith announced that she, deputy leader Rob Anderson, and seven other Wildrose MLAs were crossing the floor to join the PCs. Smith had criticized two other Wildrose MLAs for defecting to the PCs a month earlier; she had publicly stated that \\"there'll be no more floor crossings.\\" It was later revealed, however, that Smith and Prentice had been in talks about a possible merger for several months.9 Wildrose MLAs, including Danielle Smith, cross to Alberta Tories. CBC News, 2014-12-17. Smith said that several conversations with Prentice revealed that they shared much common ground, particularly on fiscal issues. Ultimately, she concluded that it made little sense for her to continue in opposition. \\"If you‚Äôre going to be the official Opposition leader,\\" she said, \\"you have to really want to take down the government and really take down the premier. I don't want to take down this premier. I want this premier to succeed.\\"Alberta‚Äôs Wildrose leader and eight members join Prentice government. Canadian Press, 2014-12-17. Several weeks after Smith joined the Progressive Conservatives, in a Facebook post, she apologized for the anger caused by her move and for not consulting with Albertans before making the decision. At the same time, she stood by her decision to \\"unify conservatives\\" in the province, and indicated that she intended to seek the Progressive Conservative nomination in Highwood for the next election. Smith was defeated in her bid for the PC nomination in Highwood by Okotoks Councillor Carrie Fischer on March 28, 2015. Smith's defeat was attributed to her floor-crossing which angered many in her riding.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/danielle-smith-loses-pc- nomination-in-highwood-to-carrie-fischer-1.3013567 Fischer then lost to Wildrose candidate Wayne Anderson in the general election. Since her retirement from provincial politics, Smith has joined Calgary radio station News Talk 770 as the afternoon show host. Public image Smith presents herself as a libertarian, particularly on moral issues. She is pro-choice on abortion, and also supports same-sex marriage. A Wildrose insider told Calgary Herald editorial page editor Licia Corbella that Smith had grown increasingly uncomfortable leading a party with a strong tinge of social conservatism.Corbella, Licia. Danielle Smith leads a bounty of mutiny. Calgary Herald, 2014-12-18. Smith herself told CBC News that the defeat of the anti- discrimination resolution led her to seriously consider returning to the PCs. During the 2012 provincial election, she was compared to 2008 US candidate for vice president, Sarah Palin. She has a declared affinity towards former Reform Party leader Preston Manning, and to Stephen Harper, with whom she shared a mentor, Tom Flanagan. Smith distanced herself and the Wildrose Party from Flanagan in February 2013, after he made controversial remarks regarding child pornography. She has been described as media-savvy and adept at presenting a professional and polished image. Controversies Smith has repeatedly shared false information about health. In 2012, she suggested meat contaminated with Escherichia coli could be given to poor people. In early 2020, she falsely claimed a cure for COVID-19. She later removed this claim. Life after politics Smith lives in High River, a town south of Calgary. She is the current host of a talk radio program on CHQR in Calgary.

He kept his own pack of hounds and his 1781 work Thoughts upon Hunting is a classic and authoritative detailed guide to the art of foxhunting. Biography Peter Beckford was born the only son of Julines Beckford of Iwerne Stepleton, Dorset in 1740. He was a nephew of William Beckford, Lord Mayor of the City of London, and cousin of William Thomas Beckford (1760‚Äì1844), author of the Gothic novel Vathek and builder of the folly Fonthill Abbey. Stepleton House, Iwerne Steepleton, Dorset In 1765, on the death of his father, Beckford inherited his estate at Stepleton House in the parish of Iwerne Stepleton near Blandford Forum in Dorset, and set out on his first visit to Italy. On the way he met Voltaire and Rousseau at Geneva, and hunted with the king of Savoy. In 1766 he visited Rome, where he was escorted by James Byres, bought several antiquities, and commissioned a modern portrait (probably the portrait of Beckford by Pompeo Batoni).A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy, 1701-1800 Compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells (1997), p.70-71.I. Bignamini, Digging And Dealing In Eighteenth-Century Rome (2010), p.238-239 There he was so impressed by the young Muzio Clementi's musical talent that he persuaded Clementi's father to let him take Clementi to his estate in Britain for seven years. Beckford agreed to provide quarterly payments to sponsor Muzio's musical education until the boy reached the age of 21. (Beckford himself claimed to have \\"bought Clementi from his father for a period of seven years\\".) He became the Member of Parliament for Morpeth, Northumberland in 1768. On 22 March 1773 Beckford married Hon. Louisa Pitt (1754‚Äì1791), the daughter of the British diplomat and politician George Pitt, 1st Baron Rivers (1721‚Äì1803) and Penelope Atkins. Their first son was born on 9 September 1776 but survived only a few months; Beckford's first surviving son was Horace, born at Sudeley Castle on 2 December 1777. Beckford was an enthusiastic hunter, and in 1781 published his Thoughts upon Hunting In a Series of Familiar Letters to a Friend. In 1783, on the deterioration of his wife's health, Beckford returned to Italy with his family. His wife and a young daughter died at Florence; and he returned to Britain in 1799. In 1805 he published his Familiar Letters from Italy to a Friend in England. He died in 1811.

The establishment of a large military training area (Truppen√ºbungsplatzes Bergen) by the German armed forces, the Wehrmacht, as part of their rearmament and preparation for war resulted in the evacuation of 24 villages and, since then the training area has been out-of-bounds to non-military personnel. Today it has become the Bergen-Hohne Training Area, the largest of its kind in Europe.  Geographical location of the Heidmark  The region of 'Heytmarke' was recorded in the Celle Vogtei registers as early as the 15th century. It belonged to the district office (Amtsvogtei) of Fallingbostel and comprised the parishes of Fallingbostel, Dorfmark, Meinerdingen and D√ºshorn including Ostenholz.Hinrich Baumann: Die Heidmark-Wandel einer Landschaft, Today it refers to the region between Fallingbostel, Soltau and Bergen which, since the creation of the military training area in 1935/1936 has been largely closed to the public. The centre point of the Heidmark was Fallingbostel.  History of the Heidmark  Grave D at the Sieben Steinh√§user The folk in the area around the Sieben Steinh√§user and the Falkenberg suffered much during the Thirty Years War, especially in those villages that lay on the routes taken by the Army. The life of its farmers was for a long time dependent on sheep farming, but this faded into the background during the first half of the 19th century; the whole landscape changed and fields were cultivated on the heathland with its loamy, sandy soils. The herds of moorland sheep, the Heidschnucke, disappeared as the tracts of heathland were afforested and made way for plantations of beech, oak and spruce, resulting in the emergence of mixed woods. Many attempts were made in the eastern Heidmark to make economic progress. The discovery of artificial fertiliser enabled the heathland farmers to become genuinely self-sufficient. They earned more income from their fields and were able to sell grain and fruit. Crafts were an important source of income and employment in the Heidmark. It was especially common in Oerbke where there were numerous lines of work. As well as the farming and estate families, tradesmen also settled in the Heidmark and built estate houses and manor houses. In 2007 many of these manorial building are still standing. There are small village schools in the Heidmark, as well as several parishes and numerous societies. When the 'relocation' took place from 1935 to 1938 in order to make way for a military training area for the Wehrmacht, entire villages disappeared forever from the map. Many people from the Heidmark had to leave their family homes which their families had lived in for centuries. = Seasonal migration to Holland = The heathland farmers lacked meadows and pastures. In order to ensure their economic survival, early on they had to acquire pastureland in the \\"Krelinger Bruch\\" far from their farmsteads, as can be seen from the register of wills of 1667. At harvest time they had to stay in the Bruch until all the hay was dry. That could take two weeks or more. \\"Holland trippers\\" (Hollandg√§nger) were also mentioned in the records from 1786. These folk shouldered their scythes and left in May on foot for Holland in order to mow in return for payment. The majority of these Hollandg√§nger were day labourers (H√§uslinge) and were told to go and earn this extra income. After 1850 these trips to Holland gradually died away. The last \\"Holland tripper\\" from the eastern Heidmark is mentioned in the documents in 1865. = Hunting in the Heidmark = In ancient times, in addition to the ruler (the duke), the nobility had hunting rights in the Heidmark. The chief hunting rights in the Heidmark were granted to the von der Wense and von Hodenberg families. In the register of wills in 1667 it says: :\\"Moreover, the von der Wense family have the freedom to shoot and have brought down deer and wild boar in their spruce forests, from which most noble lords are also not excluded. They may also, as far as their law and tradition allows, go hunting with the Strickjagd. The von Hodenbergs at Hudem√ºhlen are entitled to bring down deer and wild boar in their own forests, but only permitted to use Strickjagd in the Amstvogtei of Fallingbostel, as far as their authority allows. And they may keep stores with their farmers and therefore attend the hunt twice a year, once in the grass season (between Easter and Midsummer) and once in the hay season (between Michaelmas and Christmas)... \\"Erbregister 1667 The farmers of the Heidmark, for whom hunting \\"was inherited from the blood of their forebears\\", as tradition has it, would have reimbursed themselves. They poached whenever they could. That was considered an unwritten right and not as a sin. Nevertheless the gendarmes had to track down the poachers and hand them over to the courts. = Justice in the Heidmark = Tradition has it that once Goding (thingsteads or Gogerichte) and Holting (forest courts or Holzgerichte) were convened in Dorfmark, Fallingbostel, Ostenholz and at the Heidhof. At the Heidhof sentences were passed in the manner of a vehmic court (Femegerichte). The last execution in the Heidmark was in 1777. However that has been passed by word of mouth from generation to generation, because the documents associated with it were destroyed in a fire in 1784. Over centuries it has been reported that the owner of the Jacobshof in Ahlften, Johann Hinrich Apenriep, who came from Castens Hof in Meimen, had collected the executioner, Holdorf, from L√ºneburg and had driven him to Fallingbostel. Holdrof had then beheaded a woman or a girl. = Church parishes in the Heidmark = For a very long time the lives of the heath farmers were closely linked to the churches. A deed by the Emperor, Otto III, of 7 May 986 documents that there were already churches and abbeys in Walsrode and Ahlden at that time. The church at Dorfmark was first mentioned in 1006. The other parishes were not mentioned in the records until later, however. For example: Schwarmstedt was first mentioned in 1221, D√ºshorn in 1230, Meinerdingen in 1269 and Bierde in the 15th century, but were probably established long before then. The inhabitants of the Heidmark went through the Reformation in the reign of Duke Ernest the Confessor who had accepted Lutheran teaching early on. There were and are many churches and parishes in the Heidmark. These Evangelical-Lutheran parishes were and, to some extent still are, meeting places for the community. = The Heidmark in other names = * In Bad Fallingbostel there is a Heidmarkstra√üe. = Culture and places of interest = Monument to Heinrich von Quintus Icilius (1864) Farmhouse on the Heidmark in an old Fachhallenhaus Cemetery of the Unknown Soldiers * in Bad Fallingbostel: ** the Heidmarkhalle ** Museum of the Archaeological Society (Arch√§ologischen Arbeitsgemeinschaft e.V.).

He became a journalist, writing as R. S. Whitington. Early life Whitington was born in the Adelaide suburb of Unley Park, the younger son of businessman Guy Whitington (c. 1880 ‚Äì 5 February 1954) and a member of the distinguished Whitington family of South Australia.

Cricket career Whitington began his state cricketing career for South Australia at the age of 20 in November 1932 under the captaincy of Victor Richardson as an opening batsman. He was a regular member of the South Australian side until World War II, playing 36 matches and scoring 1728 runs at an average of 30.85, with three centuries. His highest score for South Australia was 125, which he scored twice against Queensland: in 1936‚Äì37, batting at number three, he was the highest scorer in a match that South Australia won by 112 runs; in 1938‚Äì39, opening, he put on 197 for the first wicket with Ken Ridings in a ten-wicket victory. He resumed his first-class career after his war service, taking part in the Australian Services tour of England in 1945, the tour of Ceylon and India, and the short tour of Australia. He played 18 matches on the three tours, scoring 1054 runs at an average of 35.13. He scored one century, 155, in the second of the three matches against an Indian XI: opening, he put on 218 in 175 minutes for the second wicket with Jack Pettiford. In his final first-class match, the last match of the tour, he made 84, the Services XI's top score, in the draw against Queensland. Journalism Whitington was a prominent journalist and writer, usually writing as \\"R. S. Whitington\\", and he balanced this work with his playing career until his retirement. He was known for his collaborations with Services XI teammate Keith Miller; the pair wrote many books together. Whitington wrote for the Sydney Sun. He was sports editor and roving Test reporter for Consolidated Press, owned and managed by the Packer family. For five years, from the late 1950s to the early 1960s, he worked in South Africa. He wrote numerous books on cricket, many of them prefaced by Sir Robert Menzies, and in later years, the official biography of Sir Frank Packer, and a history of Australian cricket.

Written by David Gerrold and directed by Dennis Steinmetz, it first aired in the United States on September 7, 1974 on NBC. Actor Cha-Ka was played by 11-year-old actor Phillip Paley. Plot An enormous earthquake plunges Rick, Will, and Holly Marshall \\"down a thousand feet below\\" to the Land of the Lost while river-rafting. When their raft washes ashore, they are met with a tyrannosaur they soon dub \\"Grumpy\\", who chases them till they reach a homely cave located up a steep cliff. Presumably the next day, the Marshalls begin to explore the jungle and encounter a browsing Coelophysis, whom Holly decides to name \\"Spot\\" (to Will's chagrin). However, they are soon chased off by Grumpy. While hiding in the bracken, Rick suggests that the crack through which they fell in their raft was a \\"hole in space\\" and that they have entered another world using the presence of three moons in the sky to back up his claim. After further running, Rick tells Will and Holly to lie in wait while he sees if the route to the cave is safe. While in hiding, Will and Holly hear the sound of chanting and head toward the source, believing it to come from humans. They run into a clearing where they discover a large, metallic \\"pylon\\" which emits a high-pitched whirring sound. To the touch it is unnaturally smooth and cold. Remembering the chanting, the siblings head to the tree line and observe three manlike simians attempting to create a fire while chanting an invocation in their native language. The creatures are interrupted in their ritual by Grumpy, who wounds the leg of the smallest of the creatures. The tyrannosaur gives chase to the remaining two and Holly runs out to rescue the wounded one. Will carries him back to their hiding place in the bracken where they discover that the creature's right leg is sprained. Will and Holly are able to glean from the creature that his name is Cha-Ka and that his people are called \\"Pakuni\\". When Rick returns, he decides to take Cha-Ka to the cave, where their supplies can be used to mend his leg. Realizing the Paku cannot scale the cliff in his condition, Rick lowers a lift from the cave which they have apparently constructed to haul supplies, but the endeavor is interrupted by the return of Grumpy, forcing Will and Cha-Ka to take shelter in the rocks while Rick and Holly hide in the cave. Rick and Holly take a sharpened stick which they refer to as the \\"flyswatter\\" and stab Grumpy in his open mouth, forcing him to flee. Cha-Ka is then carried up to the cave where Rick makes a splint. While preparing dinner, Holly uses a lighter, which greatly fascinates Cha-Ka. He refers to it as \\"Ota\\" in stunned tones. During the night Cha-Ka steals the lighter and limps off to find his fellow Pakuni. The Marshalls secretly follow him, but are threatened by the two elder Pakuni, Ta and Sa. During the scuffle, Grumpy returns and frightens both Cha-Ka and the others away. The Marshalls make their way to the safety of their cave, believing Cha-Ka to have left them. The next morning, however, a feast of native fruits have been placed on their doorstep by Cha-Ka, who watches them smiling from the bushes. The Marshalls conclude that Cha-Ka has become their friend. The episode closes with Grumpy roaming the jungle. Reception The online review site Premium Hollywood described the episode in 2009 as \\"really a very boring start for the series\\", adding that it was likely toned down to avoid frightening its young viewership. In Sid and Marty Krofft: A Critical Study of Saturday Morning Children's Television, 1969-1993, film and television historian Hal Erickson praises Land of the Lost for not revealing all the details of the show's premise in the first episode, instead spreading out plot revelations throughout the first season. In \\"Cha-ka\\", only the dinosaurs and Pakuni are revealed; later episodes would introduce the Sleestak and other elements of the program's mythology. Erickson contrasts this with \\"standard operating procedure in the 1970s ... to lay all the cards on the table in the opening episode\\", and lauds the show's creators Sid and Marty Krofft for \\"having enough confidence in [their] young audience to unfold [the] series' exposition over a matter of weeks rather than minutes\\".

Introduced in a backdoor pilot on the sitcom Girlfriends as Joan Clayton's cousin, Melanie chooses to support her boyfriend Derwin Davis' career with the San Diego Sabres, a fictional National Football League (NFL) team, rather than attend medical school at Johns Hopkins University. The series focuses primarily on Melanie and Derwin's complicated relationship, with her fears of his infidelity at the center of many of the episodes' storylines. Mowry left the series in 2012 upon learning that her role would be reduced as a result of co-star Pooch Hall's decision to reduce his role on The Game to appear in the crime drama series Ray Donovan. Both actors reprised their roles in the series finale, in which Melanie gives birth to twins. Melanie was created by producer Mara Brock Akil. While casting the character, Brock Akil had doubts about whether Mowry would be the best choice, given her wholesome image from starring as Tia Landry on the sitcom Sister, Sister, but hired the actress based on her strong work ethic and her desire to be part of the series. Mowry considered the character to be her first adult role and felt it emphasized her individuality and maturity. She identified closely with the part, observing parallels between Melanie's relationship with Derwin and her own marriage to actor Cory Hardrict. She cited The Game as an example of women receiving more lead roles on television. Reaction to Melanie was primarily negative; critics expressed disapproval of her decision to support her boyfriend instead of enrolling in medical school. Media commentators also panned the character's representation as a mother, such as her inability to properly care for her stepson. On the other hand, fans responded positively to Melanie and felt drawn to her relationship with Derwin. Mowry's performance received positive feedback from critics, who agreed that the role displayed her maturity as an actress. She received nominations for two NAACP Image Awards and a Teen Choice Award for the role. Role The Game, which aired on The CW Television Network and BET, explores the lives of a group of women romantically involved with professional football players. Introduced as the cousin of Joan Clayton (Tracee Ellis Ross) in a backdoor pilot on Girlfriends, Melanie Barnett aspires to be a doctor and is admitted to the medical school at Johns Hopkins University. Against Joan's objections, Melanie decides against attending Johns Hopkins in favor of moving to San Diego to support her boyfriend Derwin Davis' career with the San Diego Sabers, a fictional National Football League (NFL) team. Melanie enrolls at a local college and becomes a close friend of Tasha Mack, a single mother and manager of quarterback Malik Wright, and Kelly Pitts, the trophy wife of the team's captain, Jason Pitts. She struggles to be accepted by the wives and girlfriends of the San Diego Sabers, who have formed a group named \\"The Saber Sunbeams\\". Storylines frequently address her fears that Derwin will cheat on her. She turns to Tasha and Kelly for help in handling the stress of being in a relationship with a professional football player; Tasha and Kelly's advice includes the idea of using an ultraviolet light to check for fluids on hotel bed sheets. Halfway through the show's first season, Derwin proposes marriage to Melanie on live television, during the halftime of a Sabres game. Even though she has concerns, she accepts. The couple end their engagement after Melanie discovers that Derwin had sex with a singer. She considers returning to her hometown rather than continue \\"life as a football girlfriend\\". Following their break-up, Melanie has sex with several men, and Derwin impregnates another woman. Melanie struggles to balance her career with her personal life. Even though Melanie and Derwin have relationships with other people, they still have feelings for each other. Melanie eventually reconciles with Derwin, and the couple marry. She has a strained relationship with her stepson, as she views him as a reminder of Derwin's past infidelity. As a result, Derwin considers her to be an unfit parent and allows her only limited contact with the child. During this time, Melanie reveals to Derwin that she had an abortion, suffering from complications that greatly reduced her chances of conceiving children naturally. She made the decision as she felt that having a child by another man would permanently ruin her relationship with Derwin. At the end of the show's fifth season, Melanie and Derwin move to Baltimore after he is traded to play for a team based in the city, and she finally enrolls at Johns Hopkins University. In her return to The Game in the series finale, Melanie nears the end of a high-risk pregnancy and gives birth to twins. Development =Creation and casting= alt=A woman with curly black hair is talking into a microphone. Producers Mara Brock Akil and Kelsey Grammer developed The Game as a spin-off of the sitcom Girlfriends. Brock Akil originally conceived the show and the characters of Melanie and Derwin to give viewers access to the world of professional football, a sport she and her husband appreciate. From the series' inception, she intended to include story arcs relating to themes of race and celebrity. The New York Times' Virginia Heffernan wrote that one of the show's objectives was \\"to relieve ideological tensions instead of creating or ignoring them\\", citing its multi-ethnic female cast of characters as one of the means of achieving this goal. Melanie, and the rest of main cast of The Game, were first introduced in the Girlfriends episode \\"The Game\\". She later made a cameo appearance alongside Derwin in Girlfriends Season7 finale \\"It's Been Determined\\" as guests at Joan's engagement party. Cynthia Addai-Robinson was originally cast to play Melanie, but was replaced by Tia Mowry prior to development of the backdoor pilot. The CW Television Network did not provide a reason for the casting change. Critics frequently billed Mowry as The Game lead actress, and Brock Akil referred to Melanie and Derwin as \\"the heart\\" of the series. Mowry's twin sister Tamera Mowry accompanied her to her audition. Tamera had tried out for the role previously; she said it was common for them to read for the same part, but emphasized that \\"[they're] very different actors.\\" When she saw the two women together, Brock Akil initially debated whether they would be appropriate for the show's tone. She was concerned about the sisters' wholesome image gained from their years as child actors on the sitcom Sister, Sister, explaining, \\"I had a certain image of them. I didn't know if they wanted to go where I wanted the character to go.\\" On hearing of the twins' interest in the show, Brock Akil asked them if their management was aware of her writing style. When questioned by Brock Akil, Tia responded: \\"I'm a woman, Mara. I can do this.\\" Though Tia was chosen for the part, Tamera later appeared as a guest star during the show's fifth season. Brock Akil said Tia won the role over Tamera because she had a more \\"serious personality\\" and \\"made all the necessary adjustments to get this part\\". The producer explained that she appreciated Tia's work ethic and her strong desire to be a part of the series; she described Tia's audition as \\"fighting everybody's preconceived notions of her\\" by playing the more mature Melanie. =Portrayal and characterization= Prior to hearing about The Game, Mowry had changed her appearance in order to be perceived as more mature and to emphasize the differences between herself and her twin sister. During this process, she lost and straightened her hair for auditions. To prepare for the role, she frequently consulted her cousin, retired NFL fullback Jameel Cook, and other professional athletes. Mowry felt playing the role of Melanie would enable her to be perceived as more mature following her appearances as Tia Landry on Sister, Sister. When discussing her reasons for auditioning, she said she wanted to take on a more difficult role. She also described The Game as an opportunity to showcase her individuality. Mowry identified Melanie as the closest match to her personality in comparison to her previous roles. She cited her character's relationship with Derwin as reminiscent of her own romance and subsequent marriage to actor Cory Hardrict. Describing Melanie as a \\"vixen\\", Mowry believes the character's imperfections allowed her to grow as an actor. She felt the show was evidence, alongside Sex and the City and Desperate Housewives, that women had more leading roles on television, and said this \\"allows women to be women and to show their different emotions and what we deal with in lifeperiod\\". Melanie's intellect, one of her defining characteristics, earned her the nickname \\"Med School\\". VIBE Vixen's Jennifer Hickman referred to Melanie as \\"bookwormy\\", and Virginia Heffernan characterized her as \\"wholesome and a good student\\" in the pilot. Heffernan called the character a \\"kind of Cosby Show figure\\" due to her initial reluctance to join the Sabre Sunbeams. =Departure and return= After The Game aired for three seasons on the CW, the network canceled the series, having decided to stop developing sitcoms. Picked up by BET, the show aired for six more seasons. Mowry and Hall left The Game in 2012 after Hall accepted a lead role in the crime drama television series Ray Donovan. Mowry left the show when Melanie's role was slated to become \\"less important\\" in comparison to previous seasons. Announcing her departure on Twitter, she emphasized that it was a mutual decision with the network. Brock Akil said she provided closure to Melanie and Derwin's story arc through their exit, explaining: \\"They're together, and we were able to put a period on their story.\\" Following Melanie and Derwin's exit, two characters, draft pick Bryce \\"The Blueprint\\" Westbrook and child star Keira Whitaker, portrayed by Jay Ellis and Lauren London, respectively, were introduced on the series. Media outlets viewed Keira and London as replacing Melanie and Mowry, but Ellis and London objected to comparisons made between Melanie and Derwin and Bryce and Lauren, believing the two pairs were separate characters. Following Mowry's exit, actress Keke Palmer was offered a lead role in the series but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with the development of her daytime talk show Just Keke. Brock Akil described the changes made to The Game as a \\"true resurrection\\", with Wendy Raquel Robinson (Tasha Mack) saying future episodes would be \\"completely different, crisper and edgier and sexier\\". For the series finale, Mowry and Hall reprised their roles as Melanie and Derwin even though Mowry had written on her Facebook page that she would not reappear on the show. Hall announced their return during the 2015 BET Awards, where the show's cast had attended to say \\"their final goodbyes\\". Discussing the direction intended for Melanie and Derwin's final appearance, Brock Akil said: \\"To bring these characters back to shore is such a blessing. They get an ending. They get closure.\\" She added that their storyline would appeal to the show's fans, explaining: \\"I feel creatively we've been able to answer those who have been loyal to us. It's truly a tip of the hat to the fans who will get to see if Melanie and Derwin get their happily-ever-after.\\" Critical reception =Response to Melanie= alt=A picture of a woman with braided dark hair. She is wearing a black shirt with a flower design and is looking toward the camera. Melanie Barnett has been negatively received by television critics. Melanie McFarland of The Seattle Post-Intelligencer panned the character along with the show's main premise (\\"A woman on a professional track kicks it all aside to chase a football player\\"), feeling they were contradictory to the message of the parent show Girlfriends. Echoing McFarland's assessment, The San Francisco Chronicle's Tim Goodman found Melanie's decision to be \\"a bleak little life lesson\\". When discussing the transition to BET, Britney Wilson of Clutch was critical of the deterioration of female friendships on the show, citing \\"the disintegration of the female identity\\" as signs of The Game declining quality. The character's representation as a mother also received criticism. Wilson viewed negatively Melanie's decision to have an abortion in an attempt to reconcile with Derwin, and criticized the show's depiction of an abortion causing Melanie to become barren as based on \\"a link that is not medically solid\\". In her 2015 book Representations of Black Women in the Media: The Damnation of Black Womanhood, California State University associate professor Marquita Marie Gammage felt the character was perpetuating negative images of black motherhood on television. Gammage criticized the series for showing Melanie becoming a wife \\"at the expanse of her career and possibility of bear[ing] her own children\\" and portraying her as unable to care for her stepson. She contrasted Melanie to white characters on television, writing that \\"white women seem to achieve it all and control their realities on their own terms.\\" Mowry received positive feedback from fans, who \\"were fairly obsessed with Melanie and Derwin's journey early on\\". Fans reacted positively to the characters' relationship, and dubbed the couple the portmanteau \\"Merwin\\", which BET adopted and used to promote Mowry and Hall's appearances in the series finale. Jaime Lee of Soap Opera Network wrote that, in relating to their struggles, viewers connected with the fictional couple. A writer from HuffPost cited the pairing as a \\"big part of the winning formula for the series\\", and Mowry attributed the positive fan response to her chemistry with Hall. She said the following about the character's reception in The Washington Post: =Response to Mowry= Mowry's performance received positive feedback from critics. While discussing her career in his 2010 book Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television, author Bob McCann wrote that Mowry demonstrated maturity through her more dramatic role in the series. Though critical of the overall show, the Chicago Tribune Maureen Ryan was pleased with Mowry's charismatic performance. Melody K. Hoffman of Jet wrote that, through her performance in the show, Mowry had demonstrated her love for acting and her capacity to portray a woman. In a negative review, USA Today's Robert Bianco was uncertain of Mowry's capabilities as a comedic actress, saying she frequently relied on child acting techniques that were inappropriate for an adult character. Mowry received two nominations for NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series at the 39th and 43rd NAACP Image Awards. She was also nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress Comedy in the 2007 Teen Choice Awards.

It is a kind of transmitter to convert information to optical binary signal through optical fiber (optical waveguide) or transmission medium of optical frequency in fiber optic communication. There are several methods to manipulate this device depending on the parameter of a light beam like amplitude modulator (majority), phase modulator, polarization modulator etc. The easiest way to obtain modulation is modulation of intensity of a light by the current driving the light source (laser diode). This sort of modulation is called direct modulation, as opposed to the external modulation performed by a light modulator. For this reason, light modulators are called external light modulators. According to manipulation of the properties of material modulators are divided into two groups, absorptive modulators (absorption coefficient) and refractive modulators (refractive index of the material). Absorption coefficient can be manipulated by Franz- Keldysh effect, Quantum-Confined Stark Effect, excitonic absorption, or changes of free carrier concentration. Usually, if several such effects appear together, the modulator is called electro-absorptive modulator. Refractive modulators most often make use of electro-optic effect (amplitude & phase modulation), other modulators are made with acousto-optic effect, magneto- optic effect such as Faraday and Cotton-Mouton effects. The other case of modulators is spatial light modulator (SLM) which is modified two dimensional distribution of amplitude & phase of an optical wave. Optical modulators can be implemented using Semiconductor Nano-structures to increase the performance like high operation, high stability, high speed response, and highly compact system. Highly compact electro-optical modulators have been demonstrated in compound semiconductors.Sadagopan, T., Choi, S. J., Dapkus, P. D. & Bond, A. E. Digest of the LEOS Summer Topical Meetings MC2‚Äì-3 IEEE, Piscataway, New Jersey (2004) However, in silicon photonics, electro-optical modulation has been demonstrated only in large structures, and is therefore inappropriate for effective on-chip integration. Electro-optical control of light on silicon is challenging owing to its weak electro-optical properties. The large dimensions of previously demonstrated structures were necessary to achieve a significant modulation of the transmission in spite of the small change of refractive index of silicon. Liu et al. have recently demonstrated a high-speed silicon optical modulator based on a metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor (MOS) configuration.Liu, A. et al. Nature 427, 615‚Äì618 (2004) Their work showed a high-speed optical active device on silicon‚Äîa critical milestone towards optoelectronic integration on silicon.  Electro-optic modulator of nano- structures  An electro-optic modulator is a device which can be used for controlling the power, phase or polarization of a laser beam with an electrical control signal. It typically contains one or two Pockels cells, and possibly additional optical elements such as polarizers. The principle of operation is based on the linear electro-optic effect (the Pockels effect, the modification of the refractive index of a nonlinear crystal by an electric field in proportion to the field strength). The crystal which is covered by electrode may be considered to be a voltage-variable wave-plate. When a voltage is applied, the retardation of laser polarization of the light would be changed while a beam passes through an ADP crystal. This variation in polarization results in intensity modulation downstream from the output polarizer. The output polarizer converts the phase shift into an amplitude modulation. Micrometre-scale silicon electro-optic modulatorNature 435, 325‚Äì327 (19 May 2005) This device was fabricated a shape of the p-i-n ring resonator on a silicon-on-insulator substrate with a 3-mm-thick buried oxide layer. Both the waveguide coupling to the ring and that forming the ring have awidth of 450 nm and a height of 250 nm. The diameter of the ring is 12 mm, and the spacing between the ring and the straight waveguide is 200 nm.  Acousto-optic modulator of nano-structures  Acousto-optic modulators are used to vary and control laser beam intensity. A Bragg configuration gives a single first order output beam, whose intensity is directly linked to the power of RF control signal. The rise time of the modulator is simply deduced by the necessary time for the acoustic wave to travel through the laser beam. For highest speeds the laser beam will be focused down, forming a beam waist as it passes through the modulator. In an AOM a laser beam is caused to interact with a high frequency ultrasonic sound wave inside an optically polished block of crystal or glass (the interaction medium). By carefully orientating the laser with respect to the sound waves the beam can be made to reflect off the acoustic wave-fronts (Bragg diffraction). Therefore, when the sound field is present the beam is deflected and when it is absent the beam passes through undeviated. By switching the sound field on and off very rapidly the deflected beam appears and disappears in response (digital modulation). By varying the amplitude of the acoustic waves the intensity of the deflected beam can similarly be modulated (analogue modulation). File:Acousto-optic Modulator.png Acoustic solitons in semiconductor nanostructuresJournal of Physics: Conference Series 92 (PHONONS 2007) Acoustic solitons strongly influence the electron states in a semiconductor nanostructure. The amplitude of soliton pulses is so high that the electron states in a quantum well make temporal excursions in energy up to 10 meV. The subpicosecond duration of the solitons is less than the coherence time of the optical transition between the electron states and a frequency modulation of emitted light during the coherence time (chirping effect) is observed. This system is for an ultrafast control of electron states in semiconductor nanostructures.  Magneto-optic modulator of nano-structures  A dc magnetic field Hdc is applied perpendicular to the light propagation direction to produce a single domain, transverse directed 4~Ms. The rf modulation field Hrf, applied by means of a coil along the light propagation direction, wobbles 4~Ms through an angle of @ and produces a time varying magnetization component in the longitudinal direction. This component then produces an ac variation in the plane of polarization via the longitudinal Faraday effect. Conversion to amplitude modulation is accomplished by the indicated analyzer. File:optical mod2.jpg Wideband magneto-optic modulation in a bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet waveguideOptics Communications Volume 220, Issues 4‚Äì6 The current transient creates a time-varying magnetic field that has a component along the direction of optical propagation. This component (underneath the microstrip line) acts to tip the magnetization, M, along the propagation direction of the optical beam. A static in-plane magnetic field, by, is applied perpendicular to the light propagation direction, thus ensuring the return of M to its initial orientation after the passage of the current transient. Depending on the component of the magnetization along the z-direction, Mz, the optical beam experiences a rotation of its polarization due to the Faraday effect. The polarization modulation is converted into an intensity modulation via a polarization analyzer, which is detected by a high-speed photodiode.  Other semiconductor nanostructures of optical modulator  MODULATION OF THz RADIATION BY SEMICONDUCTOR NANOSTRUCTURESMICROWAVE AND OPTICAL TECHNOLOGY LETTERS / Vol. 35, No. 5, December 5, 2002 As a result of increased demand for bandwidth, wireless short-range communication systems are expected to extend into the THz frequency range. Therefore, the fundamental interactions between THz radiation and semiconductors are receiving increasing attention. This new quantum structure is based on the well-established technology for producing high electron mobility transistors where an electron gas is confined at a GaAs/AlxGa1 xAs interface. The electron density at the hetero-interface can be controlled by the application of an external gate voltage, which in turn will alter the transmission/reflection characteristics of the device to an incident THz beam.

The game is similar to a numbers racket. Playing fafi Fafi participants choose the number they want to gamble on by interpreting their dreams. This dream interpretation or conversion is based upon a variety of systems. When they have decided upon their lucky number, participants will then place a bet on their number. A dream about robbers (izigebengu/amasela) may indicate the number 7. A dream about a white person (umLungu) is the number 1, whereas a dream about the sea could either indicate the number 3 for a ship (inqanawe) or 26, the number for water (amanzi). The game requires a woman runner (isikhwama - bag) to take a bag of bets, along with the names of the betters and their money, to someone, usually Chinese, who visits the station (house) of the runner holding the betting session. The Chinese person will take the bag from the runner and then whisper the winning number to her. The runner will then indicate with her hands to the betters which number has won, and that person will be paid out.

Whilst most defeats have been on motions or bills scheduled in \\"government time\\", on occasion motions proposed by opposition parties or backbench MPs that are critical of government policy or practice, such as opposition day motions, are passed despite the government's efforts. Most government defeats since World War II have occurred in periods of minority government or where the government has a small majority. Government defeats have been caused by backbench rebellions and by opposition parties voting against a government when they had more MPs present in the House of Commons. Earlier (1918‚Äì1945) large (of a margin of more than 100) defeats of governments were for the first MacDonald government, which suffered defeats by a margin of 166 on 8 October 1924 on the Campbell case, and by a margin of 140 in June 1924. Attlee Attlee led two ministries first Attlee ministry (1945‚Äì1950) and the second Attlee ministry (1950-1951). These defeats were under the second Attlee ministry. *29 March 1950 ‚Äì A motion to adjourn a debate on fuel was won by the Opposition 283‚Äì257. *9 April 1951 ‚Äì An order to reduce cheese rations was annulled. *5 July 1951 ‚Äì The Plasterboard (Prices) (No. 1) Order was annulled. *16 July 1951 ‚Äì Defeat on compulsory purchases of forestry.

Furthermore, an opposition amendment to the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 6) Bill on 4 September 2019, requiring that Parliament vote again on the withdrawal agreement negotiated by May, passed by default after the government failed to provide any tellers for the No lobby. Although this was officially a defeat for the government, political commentators speculated it was a deliberate attempt either to insert a wrecking amendment or to obscure the potential support for May's deal. Johnson (majority government) Since the 2019 general election, after which the Conservatives held 365 seats, Boris Johnson's second government has not been defeated. Although, on 24 June 2020, a humble address to force the publication of documents relating to the approval of planning permission for the Westferry Printworks Development passed without division.

As a child growing up in Kenya, Sila Mutungi discovered Western music through his deeply religious grandmother's radio. He honed his musical craft by singing original songs in church. In 1986, he moved to Washington, DC, ostensibly to attend college (a move partially financed by tribespeople who sold cows to raise tuition money), but instead used the funds to pay for a demo tape to pursue his dreams of a music career. However, the music industry, at that time, wasn't interested in an R&B; singer with a heavy Kenyan accent. Ten years later, having relocated to San Francisco, Sila experienced an epiphany during a Baaba Maal concert at The Fillmore. Instead of trying to hide his African heritage to fit into an American paradigm, he decided to embrace it. He once again started to write music, combining Western influences of such bands as Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, Sly Stone, James Brown, Marvin Gaye and Bob Marley with African influences, among them Maal, Fela Kuti, and Thomas Mapfumo. Calling his new sound ‚ÄúAfroFunk,‚Äù he formed Sila and the AfroFunk Experience (Sila and the A.F.E.) in 2003. The band immediately carved out a niche in the Bay Area's World Music scene, spearheading a polyrhythmic renaissance and establishing a reputation for dynamic live performances. In 2004, Sila co-founded the AfroFunk Festival, a showcase for Afro-inspired bands (the proceeds of which benefited humanitarian causes) that evolved into an annual event and tour. In 2006, Sila and the A.F.E. released their first album, The Funkiest Man in Africa ‚Äì a reference to Fela Kuti. Afropop.org called the album ‚Äúa terrific work of contemporary funk‚Äù and noted, ‚ÄúSila‚Äôs message‚Ä¶ is as strong as the musicianship.‚Äù In 2009, Sila and the A.F.E. performed well-received appearances at the Sierra Nevada World Music Festival and the Stern Grove Festival. Sila and the A.F.E. then released their second album, Black President. As SF Weekly noted, ‚ÄúSila's concern with the mission of his lyrics is matched by the power of his grooves, an addictive mix of heavy funk, lively Afrobeat, and sun-soaked island rhythms.‚Äù Hailed as one of the Top 5 Afropop albums of the year by NPR, \\"Black President\\" won the 2009 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding World Music Album (over better-known artists like Zap Mama and Omou Sangare). In January 2010, Sila announced the next step in his musical journey: a solo album which explores even more of his diverse musical tastes, from Ethiopiques-esque jazz-funk to Afro-rock, Afro-reggae and Afro-Brazilian rhythms. Working the new songs into shape during an open rehearsal residency at SF club Coda, he also found time to headline the ‚ÄúSF Hearts Haiti‚Äù benefit at the Independent, which raised over $10,000 for earthquake relief. The as-yet-untitled album is scheduled for summer 2010 release. Musical styles Afrofunk (or African Funk) is a musical genre that evolved from afrobeat in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The term \\"afrofunk\\" was coined by Fela Kuti's drummer Tony Allen (musician). After leaving Fela's Africa 70 band, Allen developed a hybrid sound, deconstructing & fusing Afrobeat with electronica, dub, R&B;, and rap. Allen refers to this synthesis as afrofunk. Modern proponents of afrofunk mix afrobeat with 1970s African funk (mainly from Nigeria, Ghana, and Sierra Leone), afropop, jazz, highlife, James Brown style soul-funk, and diverse West African tribal musical traditions.

Life He was born at South Somercotes, Lincolnshire. He was elected to a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1567, and was fellow there from 1569 to 1572. He graduated B.A. in October 1570, M.A. in June 1574, B.D. in July 1575, and D.D. on 1 July 1581.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Spackman-Stepney Having taken holy orders, he became chaplain to Thomas Cooper, Bishop of Lincoln, by whom he was made archdeacon of Stow on 1 March 1575. By the favour of Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton, he was presented also to the rectory of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, where he was instituted on 2 September 1578. The rectory and archdeaconry being at some distance from each other, Sparke resigned the latter \\"out of conscience\\" in 1582. On 26 September of the same year he was installed prebendary of Lincoln. Together with Walter Travers, Sparke represented the Puritan positions in a conference held at Lambeth in December 1584 with Archbishop John Whitgift and Cooper as Bishop of Winchester, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and Francis Walsingham being present. They protested against the reading of the apocryphal scriptures in churches, against private and lay baptism, the use of the sign of the cross, the celebration of private communions, and the allowance of plurality and non-residence. Neither party was satisfied. On 14 September 1585 Sparke preached at Chenies, Buckinghamshire, a funeral sermon on Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford; he also preached at the funeral of his patron, Lord Grey de Wilton, on 22 November 1593, at Whaddon, Buckinghamshire. In 1591 he published an Answere to Mr. John de Albine's notable Discourse against Heresies, against Jean d'Albin de Valsergues; his opponent's complete text is inserted and answered chapter by chapter. He was summoned by James I to the Hampton Court conference in 1603 as a nonconformist; Anthony √† Wood says that he appeared there in 1604 unconventionally dressed, and he reportedly said little. The king, however, was gracious. Sparke, in later writing A Brotherly Persuasion to Unity and Uniformity in Judgment and Practice (1607), adopted an eirenic line. He was attacked in An Antidote against the Pestiferous Writings of all English Sectaries ... in particular against Dr. Sparke, (1615) by Sylvester Norris. Sparke died at Bletchley on 8 October 1616. He was buried in the chancel of the parish church, where a monument with an epitaph was erected to him by his eldest son. Sparke married Rose, youngest daughter of John Inkforbye, merchant, of Ipswich. Of their ten children, only five survived her death on 7 August 1615. Of the sons, William Sparke (1587‚Äì1641) became chaplain to George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and succeeded his father as incumbent of Bletchley, but fell into debt and was forced to quit.

It is also found in North America. It was first described by Adrian Haworth in 1828 from the type specimen found in England. The foodplants of the larvae are poplars (Populus species) and willows (Salix species). Life cycle The moths have elongated narrow forewings with a wingspan of 14‚Äì15 mm. The forewings have a white background, with a mix of sooty black and paler colour and the hindwings are shining grey, becoming lighter towards the end. The moth is univoltine (i.e. one generation a year) flying from mid-June to early-September, and can be found on tree trunks and comes to light. =Ovum= Eggs are laid on various species of poplar including aspen (Populus tremula), white poplar (Populus alba) and willows, such as goat willow (Salix caprea) and white willow (Salix alba). Probably on a twig. =Larva= The head of the larva is brown, lighter in front, while the colour of the body is from yellow-brown to darker brown with pale yellow spots and a broad white line. The prothoracic plate is dark brown and the anal plate is bright yellow. The larva take twenty days to develop and can be found from April to June. The larvae live in female catkins, at first in a mine in the flowers and seeds. Later it feeds from a tough web, retreating when disturbed. The catkins are partly or completely destroyed by the larva. If it runs out of catkins the larva bore into the base of a bud, hollowing it out and ejecting the frass which can be seen in a small pile on the bud. =Pupa= The larva leaves it web and forms a bright-brown slender pupa, in a narrow felt-like cocoon covered in lichen. Often in a crack in the bark of the foodplant. Pupa development takes 10‚Äì14 days in June and July. Distribution This moth is found in Europe and North America.

Although the police have treated her disappearance as a case of murder, with various people arrested (but later released), her fate is unclear. Disappearance =Last known whereabouts= Lawrence was last seen near her home in Melrosegate, Heworth, York, on the afternoon of 18 March, as she returned from her work as a chef at the University of York's Goodricke College at the Roger Kirk Centre. That evening she spoke to her parents by telephone, making plans with her mother to spend Mother's Day together. Lawrence later sent a text message to a friend and has not been heard from since. The last text message from her was sent at 8:23 p.m., and her last received message, from a bar worker in Cyprus, was at 9:12 p.m. Lawrence's passport and bank cards were left at her home when she went missing. =Reported missing= Lawrence was reported missing to North Yorkshire Police (NYP) after she failed to arrive at work for her early morning shift the following day. NYP later reported that they were now treating her disappearance as a suspected murder. Speaking on the BBC's Today programme on 4 June 2009, Lawrence's father Peter said he doubted NYP claims that she had a secret life. He queried the comments made by Detective Superintendent Ray Galloway on the BBC's Crimewatch programme, specifically that parts of Claudia's life \\"remain a mystery\\" and that police believe she had \\"complicated relationships\\" that her family and friends knew nothing about. Six weeks after Lawrence went missing, the investigation into her disappearance was reclassified from a missing persons case to a suspected murder enquiry, although NYP have acknowledged they have no evidence that Lawrence is dead. Case progress =Original investigation= The independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers offered a reward of ¬£10,000 to anyone providing information which leads to the arrest and conviction of any person linked to the disappearance, but this has since been withdrawn. NYP have said that any past personal acquaintances of Lawrence have a limited time to come forward \\"in confidence\\". NYP have received over 1,200 calls offering information, and an appeal for help was made by John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York. In early June 2009, a reconstruction of Lawrence's last known movements was featured in a Crimewatch appeal. Also in June, 100 days after his daughter went missing, Peter Lawrence launched a YouTube appeal for information. In the appeal, he stated his belief that the internet was vital in the search. In late August 2009, NYP and the Lawrence family used the annual Whitby Regatta in North Yorkshire to publicise the campaign. In September 2009, NYP revealed that the search for Lawrence had been extended to Cyprus. Detective Superintendent Ray Galloway stated that Lawrence \\"knew several people who live on the island\\" and that she may have \\"received job offers\\" while there. Galloway also stated that some people who had been interviewed had been \\"reluctant and less than candid\\" when spoken to, and that a team of officers had been sent to Cyprus to interview people whom Lawrence met there. It was reported that the last text message received by Lawrence was from a man who was on the island. Later in September, detectives investigating the Lawrence case made a search of an area of the university where Lawrence worked. In October 2009, NYP revealed they were looking for the driver of a \\"rusty white van\\" who was seen trying to talk to women on Lawrence's route to work in the days before she disappeared. On 24 March 2010, NYP began searching areas of Heslington in York, based on new information received \\"in the last few days\\". On 24 March, land near to a children's play area, near a muddy farm track, was searched, and on 25 March the search was relocated to a field near to the university, an area of land which is bordered by a playing field and student accommodation. It was later stated that NYP had not found any new leads from these searches and nothing of significance had been discovered. In late December 2011, the Lawrence family asked that the unknown person who had placed a wreath on the front door of Claudia's home each Christmas from 2009 onwards to stop placing them, as it was bringing further grief. In 2014, the charity Missing People formed the Missing People Choir, of which Claudia's father Peter is a member. =2013 Major Crime Unit review= In June 2013, NYP announced the ¬£300,000 creation of a new Major Crime Unit (MCU), set up to ease the burden on day-to-day policing. Based in Harrogate, the MCU was to be tasked from October 2013 to handle crimes including rape and kidnap, and review cold cases. In July 2013, the force said the unit would assess several \\"stalled\\" cases when it opened in October, including the disappearance of a Harrogate woman in 1997 and that of Claudia Lawrence. The MCU subsequently assessed the case, and carried out new forensic searches at her home on Heworth Road. Using what were described as \\"advanced techniques not available in 2009\\", the MCU found additional fingerprints and a man's DNA on a cigarette end in her car. Work surrounding her Samsung D900 mobile phone showed from cell site activity that she was in the Acomb area of York in the weeks leading up to her disappearance, and that the phone was deliberately turned off by someone at about 12:10 GMT on Thursday, 19 March 2009. On the fifth anniversary of her disappearance, a new appeal was made on the BBC's Crimewatch, which aired on 19 March 2014. CCTV footage, recovered in 2009, showed a silver Ford Focus hatchback car, manufactured between 1998 and 2004, driving along Heworth Road. The car's brake lights come on as it approaches level with Claudia's house. On 13 May 2014, a 59-year-old man was arrested by NYP at a house in Burnholme Grove on suspicion of Claudia's murder. The man has been named locally as Michael Snelling, believed to be a project co-ordinator for the mental health charity York Mind, who until 2013 worked for the Biology department at the University of York. NYP, who also assisted Northumbria Police in a search of his deceased mother's house at North Shields, Tyneside, said that further arrests could not be ruled out. Snelling was released on police bail the following day and the forensic search of his York property ended on 21 May 2014. Snelling was re-bailed on 12 June 2014. On 23 March 2015 police announced that a local man in his 50s had been arrested on suspicion of murder, following a fresh search of an alleyway near Lawrence's home. However, on 8 March 2016, the Crown Prosecution Service abandoned proceedings against the four men who had been arrested on suspicion of murder, citing lack of evidence. The NYP blamed a lack of co-operation from witnesses. =Links to other cases= Police authorities admitted there were similarities with the cases of Melanie Hall and Joanna Yeates, two other young, blonde British women who disappeared in 1996 and 2010 respectively, but said that they have not yet found direct evidence to link them. When a young woman's body was discovered at Christmas 2010, Lawrence's father wondered whether his daughter had been found, but that victim was later identified as Yeates. In his 2017 book, Catching a Serial Killer: My hunt for murderer Christopher Halliwell, the Senior Investigating Officer in the murder investigation of Sian O'Callaghan, Stephen Fulcher, suggests there are similarities between Claudia and Sian's cases. A witness reportedly came forward to say they had seen Claudia speaking to a man matching the description of Sian's killer, Christopher Halliwell. In 2018, investigative journalist Tim Hicks and retired police intelligence officer, Chris Clark, suggested that Claudia's murder is consistent with Halliwell‚Äôs modus operandi, that Halliwell had a good knowledge of northern cities and visited the area often. 'Claudia's Law' In June 2019, ten years after Lawrence's disappearance, the Government introduced the Guardianship (Missing Person‚Äôs) Act 2017, informally known as 'Claudia's Law'. The law would allow for a guardian to be appointed to manage the affairs of a person who has been missing for 90 days or more. Such a guardian would have the power to, for example, stop direct debits for utilities. The law was introduced after campaigning by Peter Lawrence with the support of MPs.

The group was activated once again in 1953, when ADC established it as the headquarters for a dispersed fighter-interceptor squadron and the medical, maintenance, and administrative squadrons supporting it. It was replaced in 1955 when ADC transferred its mission, equipment, and personnel to the 15th Fighter Group in a project that replaced air defense groups commanding fighter squadrons with fighter groups with distinguished records during World War II. History =World War II= The group was activated shortly before the end of World War II as the 518th Air Service Group in Italy in early 1945see as part of a reorganization of Army Air Forces (AAF) support groups in which the AAF replaced Service Groups that included personnel from other branches of the Army and supported two combat groups with Air Service Groups including only Air Corps units. It was designed to support a single combat group.Coleman, p. 208 Its 944th Air Engineering Squadron provided maintenance that was beyond the capability of the combat group, its 768th Air Materiel Squadron handled all supply matters, and its Headquarters & Base Services Squadron provided other support. The unit supported the 465th Bombardment Group in Italy. The group moved to the Caribbean and provided support for flying units redeploying from Europe to the United States.

The film starred Jeet and Koyel Mullick, who also featured in Ghatak in 2006. The movie is a remake of 1996 Telugu movie Pavitra Bandham. Plot Rahul (Jeet), the son of a wealthy but traditional industrialist, returned home to his father after completing his academic career in foreign lands. When the father tries to persuade him in his marriage he puts up a fantastic condition - that he will marry the girl of his father's choice and will live as married couple for one year only, after which, if either of the two seems to feel distant from the other, the marriage will be called off. Surprisingly, the traditional father agrees and chooses Pallavi (Koel Mallick), his PA as the most appropriate bride. Now Pallavi's family consisted of her widowed mother, an elder sister deprived of her husband, a younger brother not at all competent for any job, and the youngest sister getting pregnant with the boyfriend trying to avoid responsibilities. So Pallavi, just to save her family, accepted the contract much against her wishes and thus began a curious way of life with both of the wedlocked couple leading an unreal lifestyle. Though both shared the same bed, but Rahul seemed to be oddly insensitive to Pallavi's emotions. Thus it was not strange that he never cared to celebrate Pallavi's birthday and his scathing remarks while appreciating Pallavi's cooking hurt her feelings and duty seemed the only virtue that kept Rahul any closer to his wife. But the artificiality of the story is vividly brought to fore when Rahul, after quickly recovering from a comatose condition, chiefly due to Pallavi's sincerest nursing, does not hesitate to declare that the next day is the end of their contract term when he will be willingly divorcing Pallavi. Well at this point if the audience thought that the story is nearing a tragic completion, it is only the Intermission that is declared. In the second half we see that the table turns as Rahul suddenly feels sympathetic to Pallavi and all his passions overwhelms him so much that he rushes to his in- laws' house and requests Pallavi's return. But no says the director, and the story goes on with Pallavi now rejecting all the ardent proposals of Rahul, be it him buying all the shares of Pallavi's new struggling organization just to secure for himself the position of Pallavi's boss. Surprises seem to be on store for the audience with Pallavi conceiving a child (just imagine that Rahul was in comatose for a pretty long time and the day he recovered, the couple separated) and now Rahul, in sympathy arranges for an AC bus for her and shifts her office to the ground floor. Now the only thing that remains is revelation and Pallavi invites and insults Rahul in one of the most improbable of settings with Rahul sophisticatedly defending his views. Now, it's the final part. Rahul with his friend Kesto arranges a last chance to bring back Pallavi. Rahul plans to act as beaten by some goons who were after their company for a long time. Pallavi instantly runs to see Rahul just after getting the news. But, on the way she incidentally learns everything. So, at that condition she goes to Rahul's house to insult him again and close the whole chapter completely. But, the matter turns more serious, when she finds out Rahul really severely injured and that he was not acting. She also gets wounded while trying to help Rahul. Next, we find out Rahul somehow taking Pallavi to the Maternity Ward. Finally after all these, the two again reunites in hospital bed and they celebrate the simultaneous delivery of the child and Rahul's recovery from his critical condition. Thus family ties are again restored and the happy ending is guaranteed.

The dance incorporates the male dancer ramming his crotch area into the female dancer's buttocks, and other forms of frantic movement. Daggering is not a traditional dance; it is of recent origin, associated with the 2006 wave of dancehall music.  History  The activity of \\"daggering\\" has been present in Jamaica's dancehalls for many years, but only recently has the term \\"daggering\\" been used as a description. Some argue that it's roughly the equivalent of the Caribbean‚Äôs \\"cabin stabbing\\", another style of music and dance. Mojo magazine journalist and reggae historian David Katz attributes the recent popularity of daggering to a series of dancehall music videos and artists that promoted the style. YouTube videos of people performing daggering have spread the trend worldwide.  Daggering music  Daggering is performed with dancehall music, although some artists have specifically created \\"daggering\\" music: * Aidonia * Dexta Daps * Ding Dong * Major Lazer * Mavado * Mr. Vegas * Popcaan * Shenseea * Spice * Vybz Kartel  Ban in Jamaica  In the wake of the popularity of daggering, in 2009 the Jamaican government enacted a radio and TV ban on songs and videos with blatantly sexual content. The Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation defines daggering as \\"a colloquial term or phrase used in dancehall culture as a reference to hardcore sex or what is popularly referred to as 'dry' sex, or the activities of persons engaged in the public simulation of various sexual acts and positions.\\" Therefore, \\"There shall not be transmitted, any recording, live song, or music video which promotes the act of daggering or which makes reference to, or is otherwise suggestive of daggering.\\" Also Jamaican doctors have warned of the dangers of daggering, after having many cases of damaged penis tissue. The condition can result in permanent damage, and therefore must be taken seriously. Jamaican doctors assert that those trying to replicate the powerful moves of daggering in the bedroom can end up with dramatic injuries. They say the incidence of broken penises has increased in the past year, according to an article in the Jamaican Star. The community is divided over the dance, with singers up in arms over the ban, saying it stifles their right to free speech and diversity. Andrei Laskatelev argues that in social history numerous dances have been banned (the belly dance, the tango, the waltz etc.) and that public concern about daggering stems mostly from its novelty.

Paradigmatic examples are various virtues and vices such as courage, cruelty, truthfulness and kindness. Courage for example, may be given a rough characterization in descriptive terms as '‚Ä¶opposing danger to promote a valued end'. At the same time, characterizing someone as courageous typically involves expressing a pro- attitude, or a (prima facie) good-making quality ‚Äì i.e. an evaluative statement.  A middle position  Thick concepts thus seem to occupy a 'middle position' between (thin) descriptive concepts and (thin) evaluative concepts. Descriptive concepts such as water, gold, length and mass are commonly believed to pick out features of the world rather than provide reasons for action, whereas evaluative concepts such as right and good are commonly believed to provide reasons for action rather than picking out genuine features of the world. This 'double feature' of thick concepts has made them the point of debate between moral realists and moral expressivists. Moral realists have argued that the world-guided content and the action- guiding content cannot be usefully separated, indicating that competent use of thick concepts constitutes ethical knowledge.1978, 1979, 1981; Dancy 1995, 2004. Expressivists, favoring an account of moral values as attitudes projected onto the world, wants to uphold a distinction between the (morally neutral) descriptive feature of a thick concept and the evaluative attitudes that typically goes with them.Gibbard 1992, Blackburn 1998.  Two accounts of thick concepts  Thick concepts seem to combine the descriptive features of natural concepts such as water with an evaluative content similar to the thin evaluative concepts such as good and right. How are we to understand this ‚Äòcombination‚Äô? Many theorists treat it as a conjunctive: a thick concept should be analyzed as a conjunction of a descriptive part and an evaluative part, which, at least in principle may be separated.Hare 1952, Gibbard 1992, Blackburn 1998. A basic feature of this analysis is thus that the descriptive content of a thick concept may be given in absence of the evaluative content. Returning to the example of courage, ‚Äò‚Ä¶is courageous‚Äô could on this account be analyzed as something along the lines of ‚Äò‚Ä¶opposing danger to promote a valued end‚Äô and ‚Äòthis is (prima facie) good-making‚Äô.Catherine Elgin calls this the ‚Äúskeleton account‚Äù in Elgin 2005, 343. The evaluative part, on this view, may thus be characterized as a ‚Äòprescriptive flag‚Äô attached to the concept.Williams 1985, 141 It is, on this view, in principle possible to construct a completely descriptive concept ‚Äì i.e. without evaluative force ‚Äì that picked out the same features of the world. This account of thick concepts has been criticized by other theorists, notably of moral realist persuasion.McDowell 1978, 1979, 1981; Williams 1985; Dancy 1995, 2004; McNaughton and Rawling 2000; and Little 2000. In their view, the only way to understand a thick concept is to understand the descriptive and evaluative aspects as a whole. The idea is that for a thick concept, the evaluative aspect is profoundly involved in the practice of using it; one cannot understand a thick concept without understanding also its evaluative point.The rationale for calling an action cruel rather than merely describing it in more neutral terms is to tune into this evaluative aspect. Cf. McDowell 1981. Therefore, descriptive terms cannot completely fill in the ‚Äòalong the lines‚Äô of a description such as ‚Äò‚Ä¶opposing danger to promote a valued end‚Äô. These descriptions may allow the novice to see the salient features. However a hooking on to the evaluative perspective allows the person to fully understand the 'thick' concept.

Dexteras  =Major Wrestlers= Vini Vidi Victory Originally a rebellious wrestler from a bad environment, Vini was once part of a rowdy gang that oppresses anyone inferior in their vicinity. Upon entering a gym, Vini rejuvenated himself and became devoted in protecting defenseless individuals. He then founded the Mighty Dexteras and became its leader. He's signature move is the Vini Vidi Vada Voom. With it, he strikes the opponent left and right three times before pinning them. He was active in the first and second season but didn't participate in the third. His name is somewhat based on Veni Vidi Vici, the Latin version of Julius Caesar's quote. He is voiced by Wayne Grayson. Hometown Huck Hometown Huck is a fighter from Omaha, Nebraska. Prior to his wrestling career, Huck helps others or called numbers at bingo games. When entering the arena, he has a way of greeting other by calling out names of places (e.g. countries or cities). Huck, along with Vini Vidi Victory, also serves as a judge for newcomers who wish to join The Mighty Dexteras he's voiced by Christopher Kromer. His signature move is the Hometown Shuffle. He winds up and then lands blows on the opponent in a fanciful way every time his fans utter the name of the move, and then ultimately pinning the opponent. In a match against Bucks Gazillion, it is shown that Huck can't perform the Hometown Shuffle without fan support (Bucks silenced them by giving ice cream, thus resulting Huck's defeat). He was the winner of the inaugural TWF tournament. Mr. Extremo Jimmy Median, best known by his screen name Mr. Extremo, was once an individual who only possessed ordinary qualities. Because of this, his friends made fun of him. One day, he made a name of himself when he accidentally stepped on a skateboard causing him to go airborne. Thus, he won his friends' respects. Mr. Extremo engaged himself in extreme sports and later entered the TWF. His face looks pretty much like a musician of a heavy metal rock band. His specialties in the ring include flying by using his jet pack. He made his debut in the second tournament as well as winning it. He is also the only wrestler to win more than one tournament, having won the Season 4 tournament as well. Portrayed by Sean Schemmel. Face-Off Phil Face-Off Phil is a former hockey player from Canada. He was then recruited by the Dexteras who were impressed by his performances and assumed he would make a good wrestler. He also has a 'habit' to enrage when someone insults him by insulting his country Canada, a hockey Sport, his weird accent, and by calling him 'hot-head' due to his hyperactive personality. He is the second wrestler to have a face that's patterned after a flag, which in this case the Canadian flag (the first one being James Montgomery Flag whose face is patterned after the American flag). One of his super moves is the Manitoba Mauler, which is composed two straight punches and a downward punch before pinning the opponent. Another one is the Slap Shot Slammer that's performed by projecting four hockey pucks onto the opponent using his hockey stick (Senator Skull once emulated this move in a match). Portrayed by Sean Schemmel. Wasabi Wasabi is an individual who excels in poetry. Not so popular in school, most students wouldn't socialize with her. Therefore, she spent most of her time writing in her journal. Overtime, her literature skills, particularly in poetry, picked up. Upon reciting some of her works on stage, she at last gained some attention. For some reason, she joined the Dexteras; in the battle series she is the weakest major. As a wrestler, her signature move is called the Best Poem Ever which she whispers into the ears of an opponent. Although the words of the poem were never revealed, its positive meaning can incapacitate any foe (except Senator Skull and Dwayne Bramage, they're immune to it) through fascination for a limited amount of time, allowing Wasabi to attack with ease. It's shown that Pinky has a crush on her, and ironically most of her matches are not won by 100% from herself. She won most matches because of Pinky's help or luck. Her name is a reference to a hot and spicy vegetable from Japan. She was voiced by Erica Schroeder. She was based on Alundra Blayze. Danny Kaboom Danny is the explosives expert of the Dexteras. He specializes in bombs and explosives. He was bested by N Fuego and Queen Nefercreepy in the second and third tournaments.

Portrayed by Keith Vincent Cleat Cunningham A British Dextera football player. He is one of the new characters in the season 5, where he also makes appearance as the main character of the season, and the eventual winner. His signature move is The Legendary Kick. He kicks soccer balls into his opponent's face. Then he kicks them and pins them for the win. Cleat was born with football skills. One time, he came as a football captain for his club, until the ref expelled him from a match for handball. Cleat then joined the Dexteras to earn a TWF Championship. In the Semifinals, he encountered Senator Skull, who accused Cleat of having beaten up Mr. Extremo. But it was all a lie when in the Finals Pinky uncovered Senator Skull's evil plans and Cleat's journal about how long Cleat has been learning the American culture with Colonel Cossack.

One notable wrestling attack she possesses is called the Panda Craze, a throw move that involves grabbing the opponent and flipping them sidewards using leverage. Her ultimate weapon is the Royal Sceptor of Porpoisestan, a metal rod which is used as club. It was used when she made her second appearance in the third tournament where she defeated Scoutmaster Scott, also she's married to N Fuego. Pei Pei is portrayed by Erica Schroeder. Big Star Big Star is the naive cousin of The Big Time. Though related to each other, The Big Time dislikes him because of their personality differences. Because of this, Big Star tries whatever he could to win his relative's respect. In his TWF debut which was in the second tournament, Big Star nearly defeated Evil Ira as a result of being immune to the hypnotic rays. But before he could pin him, which the traditional way of securing a win, The Big Time knocked him down using a chair. Thus giving Evil Ira an easy victory.

Number two  Sinistras  =Major Wrestlers= Senator Skull Vincent Arthur Skullberg, also known as Senator Skull, was once a simple student at school in the state of Florida. After being toyed several times by delinquents, he trained hard to become a fighter and eventually exacted vengeance against them. Still not satisfied by this, Senator Skull established the Evil Sinistras, a society of rebellious wrestlers who go by principles different from those of the TWF. When he once led the Sinistras, he had plans to bring down the Dexteras and rule the planet. But his chances of achieving them are often slim because his camp is often in turmoil (the other Sinistras have no interests in world domination). He quit in Season 3 after using a weather machine against Face-Off Phil, he says it's Canada. He then become the Sinistras' coach. His reign as leader ended when Bucks Gazillion, who won the third tournament, took charge by bribing all his comrades. In Season 4, at the championship, Senator Skull with the other Sinistras tries to stop Bucks and remove him to the position. Skull fights in Season 5 and takes out Pierre Pamplemousse and Mr. Extremo (rematch), but loses to Cleat Cunningham in the semi-finals. He's the main villain in the second tournament and fifth tournament One of his two signature moves is the Skull's Shocker Revenge, an attack where he pins down an opponent and then electrocuting them using power from within him. The other move is the Super Skull, a move so brutal and violent that its execution is censored, resulting in it never being seen. Once the move is performed however, the area is seen in total chaos and covered by a thick mist. Senator Skull once used this in a match against James Montgomery Flag and the Stash. May be based on WWE wrestler The Undertaker. The Big Time The most popular of the Sinistras, The Big Time is well known for his charisma and street cred. He has the number 12 embedded on his mask and has a moustache that look like hands of a clock. Very durable, some wrestlers find it tiring when it comes to landing blows on him. When he isn't wrestling, The Big Time serves as the trainer for the Sinistras in their headquarters. In Season 4, Episode 9, he publicly quit the Sinistras after Steve, servant of Bucks Gazillion, threw a chair at Pierre Pamplemousse while the Time Bomb was being used, essentially stealing a win from The Big Time. During Season 5, he beat Milty the Clown in Episode 9, Danny Kaboom during the quarterfinals, Hometown Huck in the semifinals, and lost to Cleat Cunningham in the championship match. His signature attack is The Time Bomb, where he swings left and right as his fans count backwards from 5 to 1. Upon pinning an opponent, an explosion occurs and is signified by a red mushroom cloud. Although it is destructive and guarantees him a win almost every time it's used, certain wrestlers, like Hometown Huck and Tom Cat, managed to endure the explosion and continued to fight. (although Tom Cat had help from Pinky, Hometown Huck had no help at all). He is voiced by Keith Dawkins (Seasons 1 and 2) and David Wills (Season 3). The Big Time's character shows signs of being influenced by professional WWE wrestler, The Big Show. Itsy Bitsy Itsy Bitsy is half-spider/half-thumb and speaks with an Italian accent. To attack rivals with ease, Itsy Bitsy traps them in a web that is very difficult to break out of (Hometown Huck was able to escape in one episode). Her name is a reference to a nursery rhyme called The Itsy Bitsy Spider. She quits in Season 4 after Corbata loses to Unit 19G (the match after she lost to Wasabi). However, Itsy returned and defeated Gary the Intern in Season 5. She lost to newcomer Cleat Cunningham in the Quarterfinals of Season 5. N Fuego N Fuego is a wrestler with a Spanish accent and is a skilled dancer. His dance moves generate heat that puts opponents at his mercy. He's active in the first and second tournament but only seen at the sidelines in the third. However, he returned in the 4th Season, beating Face- Off Phil in the quarterfinals, then he was beaten by Mr Extremo in the semi- final. He made an appearance in Season 5 where he was bested by Knockout Ninja, in Season 5, he was shown in Wasabi's bio in the beginning as he dances with the school kids. He also has the same school as Wasabi. After Itsy Bitsy and The Big Time quit, he may be promoted to second in Commander. He is portrayed by Javier Jimenez. Evil Ira Evil Ira has three eyes, a Finnish accent, and magical powers. He was then selected to become a member of the Dexteras. Though he preferred to be called Good Ira, the named was owned by someone else (see info below) and that it became suggested he be addressed as Evil Ira. After winning a few matches in the first tournament as a Dextera, Evil Ira surprisingly decided to join the Sinistras for unknown reasons (although rumored is that he accidentally hypnotized himself by mistake making him evil or he joined the Sinistras due to how good it felt for him when he cheated against N Fuego). Evil Ira's powers hypnotizing opponents using mystic energy from his third eye. He can summon objects to fall from above. He was active in seasons one and two but just appearing on the sidelines in season three. In season 4, he loses to Danny Kaboom and retires with Scoutmaster Scott before Big Bad Billy Goatetsky lost to James Montgomery Flag. He did help in the coup against Bucks Gazillion during the final. Portrayed by Sean Schemmel. Bucks Gazillion Appearing in the third tournament, Bucks Gazillion is a billionaire businessman and the new leader of the Sinistras as he is the main villain at Seasons 3 and 4. He is a clever tactician who uses money and other deceptions to outsmart opponents. Bucks also won the season 3 tournament by luring away the Dexteras and the referee to have many Sinistras gang up Face-Off Phil, paving his way to an easy victory. However, he doesn't have a desire to rule the world by winning the TWF, but instead making TWF part of his company, Gazillion Incorporated. Later in season 4, he helps the Sinistras win all their matches, but in Wasabi vs Itsy Bitsy, Unit 19G vs Corbata and James Montgomery Flag vs Big Bad Billy Goatetsky, his plans fail, and the Dexteras win those matches. He had his comeuppance in the Season 4 final when his big plan to win the title through the Visitor such as flying skateboard, obstacles, net and a metal claw, but Billy Batboy got some blueprints and they go to the ladies bathroom and to the control room. The Sinistras fight Steve and the other men and they enter the control room. The Big Time destroy the plan by smashing the \\"Gazillion Inc.\\" Themed Circuit, causing it to explode and Senator Skull now removes Bucks out of position and he is no longer leader or member of the Sinistras and he is banished away from TWF by Senator Skull. Voiced by Marc Thompson. The Visitor Alien with lots of technology such as disintegrator rays, teleporters and cloaking devices to help him win. In Season 1 he lost to Vini Vidi Victory! In Season 2 he fought in the Royal Thumble and beat Unit 19G but was taken out by James Montgomery Flag. He lost to Weredog in Season 3. In Season 4 he beat Hometown Huck and Danny Kaboom but he lost to Mr. Extremo in the championship. In Season 5 he beat Gogachog. =Minor Wrestlers= Queen Nefercreepy Making her debut in the third tournament, Queen Nefercreepy (a parody of Queen Nefertiti) is a 4,500-year-old Egyptian queen with divine powers (and a very nasty attitude). As a ruler, she takes the services she receives very seriously and would put a curse on her servants even if what they do is just slightly flawed. Her powers include dropping pyramids from the sky, summoning sand storms and even crocodiles. She has achieved victories over Danny Kaboom and Milty the Clown but her winning streak was put to a stop by Face-Off Phil. She later returned next season and beat Gogachog but later lost to Mr. Extremo. Portrayed by Vibe Jones. Mugsy Thumbscrew Mad Gangster Mobster Leader and Smooth Criminal. In Season 3 he lost to Gill. He came back in Season 4 and beat Knockout Ninja but was unable to beat Danny Kaboom. In Season 5 he beat Unit 19G and lost to Hometown Huck. He has a mob of gangsters to do his fighting for him sometimes. Voiced by Sean Schemmel, also he is actually not criminal, his signature move is a crowbar that whacks the opponent. Scoutmaster Scott This Sinistra Scoutmaster is head of the Cookie Scouts, who are like the Boy Scouts, but evil. They make the worst cookies ever, and it was revealed Scott knew this, and only fought Pei Pei so he could win and force the Porpoistanis to make the cookies instead. Despite always being angry at them, he relies on his scouts during fights, particularly during his Season 4 match against Face-Off Phil where he had them trap the Canadian in a net. He's very prone to losing his temper, and is yet to win a match, though it is unknown whether he will return after quitting in Season 4. Scott returned in Season 5 and got his first win against Tom Cat. He possibly based on Sgt. Slaughter. Voiced by Sean Schemmel. Captain Carpal As a lad, Captain Tiberious Carpal had a desire to become a pirate. After being quite a trouble in school, he travelled the seas to fulfil his ambition. Upon completing his travels, Captain Carpal joined the Sinistras. In his wrestling debut which was in the second tournament, he lost in tough match against Vini Vidi Victory. Making his return in the third event, he bested Knockout Ninja by using his signature move, a cannon. He later returned to season 4 and lost to Ms. Fitwell. Portrayed by Marc Thompson. Sick Vick Sick Vick is the sickest wrestler in the TWF, afflicted with a \\"uncommon cold\\" as just one of his many symptoms. In Season 3, he beat Miss Fitwell after grossing her out when he sneezed too hard and turned himself inside out! (Beforehand, he'd coughed up his own lungs). In Season 4, he was afflicted with chickenpox. With the help of camomile lotion and a dog catcher (courtesy of Bucks), Vick was able to defeat Weredog. He was also present at the Season 3 short \\"Ordering Out\\", vouching for Chinese Food, before being hypnotised by Evil Ira to want Pizza instead. Voiced by Dan Green Big Bad Billy Goatetsky Big Bad Billy Goatetsky is an old goat Sinistra from Wisconsin. When he was a child he lost his parents at The Vilas Park Petting Zoo. He then resorted to living with the goats of Vilas Park. He was quickly mistaken for a real goat so kids often petted him. He then started to hate children and started ramming them. He lost to Mr. Extremo in season 2 and lost to James Montgomery Flag in season 4. He lost to Cleat Cunningham in Season 5. He is the grouchiest wrestler of them all. Portrayed by Ben Masten The Cheetah The Cheetah is a sneaky female wrestler from the state of New York. As a pupil in school, she would often look at the answers used by her seatmates during exams. Before her fellow students could tattle, the Cheetah would pull a string causing heavy objects, primarily anvils, to drop on them (this is a trick she also uses as a wrestler).

The group was activated once again in 1952 to replace the support elements of the inactivating 56th Fighter- Interceptor Wing. A year later ADC established it as an operational headquarters for fighter-interceptor squadrons as well. It was replaced in 1955 when ADC transferred its mission, equipment, and personnel to the 1st Fighter Group in a project that replaced air defense groups commanding fighter squadrons with fighter groups with distinguished records during World War II.

The house is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate, the local government register in the New South Wales Heritage Database, and on the non-statutory register of the National Trust of Australia. History The Abbey was built by John Young, a builder who had migrated from England to Australia. After working for some time as a builder in Melbourne, Young moved to Sydney and continued a successful career. In 1877, he bought land in what is now the suburb of Annandale, where he had visions of creating a garden suburb that would rival exclusive harbourside suburbs like Darling Point. He proceeded to build an extraordinary group of eight homes along a ridge near Rozelle Bay: The Abbey, Oybin, Kenilworth, Rozelle (since demolished), Greba, Hockindon, Highroyd and Claremont (since demolished). The Abbey was the most outstanding of these homes, an \\"imaginative, romantic house loosely modelled on a Scottish manor\\". It was designed in a variation of the Victorian Free Gothic style and incorporated stencil work, hand-painted panels, timber architraves, a Gothic vault and a tower with gargoyles. Young was the principal builder of St Mary's Cathedral, and it was rumoured that he had stolen gargoyles from the cathedral to use on his Annandale homes. He also used reinforced concrete, quite an innovation at the time. Young was a Freemason and the house was decorated with Masonic symbols. It was completed in 1882. Young built the home to impress his wife and encourage her to return from England. She did not return and they never lived in it. The Abbey was occupied by housekeepers while Young lived in a house called Kentville, near Rozelle Bay, since demolished. From 1887, the ballroom and stables of The Abbey were used as a boarding house for private schools. In 1924, the house was subdivided and converted to flats--the beginning of a long period of decline. In 1959 it was acquired by radio engineer Lancelot Davis for the sum of for his son, Sydney surgeon Dr Geoffrey L. R. Davis. Dr Davis, an associate of the bohemian Sydney Push, continued to lease out some of the original separate units for two decades while proceeding with a long-term restoration of the house. The Davis family occupied The Abbey for fifty years. Dr Davis died in 2008. In May 2009 the contents of the house were auctioned. The house itself was sold in November 2009, for $4.86 million. Although a record for Annandale at the time, it fell short of the $5 million the vendors had expected. It surpassed the $3.35 million paid for Kenilworth in 2007. Gervase Davis believed the house was haunted. He claimed to have felt various presences from time to time, and a lady in white has been seen occasionally.The Glebe, 21 May 2009, p.11 Ghost hunters with \\"ectoplasmic machines\\" investigated the house in the 1970s. Francesca Davis believed that cats could sense the presence of spirits and her hackles would rise when such a presence came into the room. The new owners, Michael Hogan and Ann Sherry, restored the house over four years to 2015, working with heritage architect Alan Croker. The renovation won a National Trust Heritage Award in May 2015. The Abbey is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate on the local government register of the New South Wales Heritage Database, and on the non-statutory register of the National Trust of Australia.

Biography  Mitford was educated at Milton Abbey and Highgate School, before going up to Newcastle University, where he graduated with the degree of BA. He succeeded his father as The 6th Baron Redesdale, of Redesdale in the County of Northumberland, in 1991. Following the removal of hereditary peers' automatic right to a seat in Parliament by the House of Lords Act 1999, the Liberal Democrats took advantage of an offer from the New Labour Government for some of their hereditary peers to return to the House as working peers. Redesdale was created a life peer on 18 April 2000, as The Baron Mitford, of Redesdale in the County of Northumberland. At the age of 32, he was the youngest person ever to receive a life peerage. By convention, the House of Lords refer to peers holding multiple titles by whichever is senior within the peerage. Thus Mitford is known in the House as 'Lord Redesdale'. He is a first cousin once removed of the famous Mitford sisters, daughters of The 2nd Baron Redesdale. The youngest of the sisters, Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire, was, with her husband, the 11th Duke, active in the Social Democratic Party. This later merged with the Liberal Party to become the Liberal Democrats, for whom Redesdale sits in the House of Lords. He has spoken on various issues on behalf of the Lib Dem Parliamentary Party, such as the environment, international development, science and technology. He is patron of various societies, including one encouraged by his parliamentary colleagues, namely the Red Squirrel Protection Partnership, which advocates strict control of the grey squirrel population so as to enhance the chance of red squirrels' survival. Redesdale is currently the CEO of the Carbon Management Association and the Energy Managers Association. Since 2012, Redesdale has been founding Chairman of the Carbon Management Association and of the Energy Managers Association. In 2014, he, along with Jason Franks (formerly of Daily Mail and General Trust events division), founded Heelec, which launched the Energy Management Exhibition (EMEX). The show attracts over 4500 professionals from the Energy Managers Association's 25,000 community. In 2016 the association with Heelec launched the EMA magazine, serving its members and community on a bi-monthly basis. Lord Redesdale is a popular figure on social media sites, such as LinkedIn, where he has a following of around 25,000 like-minded industry professionals. He lives with his wife and four children near Tufnell Park, north London, as well as in Northumberland. The heir apparent to the title is the Hon. Bertram Mitford, born in 2000. The other three children are the Hon. Clementine Mitford, the Hon. Amelia Mitford and the Hon. Edward Mitford.

Before turning professional he won six caps for the England national amateur football team. Club football While a student at the University of Birmingham, Tewkesbury played for the university football club, and joined Birmingham as an amateur in October 1929. Deputising for Harry Hibbs who was absent on England international duty, he made his debut in the First Division on 2 April 1930, in an away game against Newcastle United which finished as a 1‚Äì1 draw.Matthews, p. 172. He played four more first-team games over the next couple of years; his performance in a 4‚Äì2 defeat by Arsenal in September 1930 was described by The Times as \\"brilliant and entertainingly unorthodox\\". He joined Aston Villa in December 1931, but moved on to Notts County a few months later without having appeared for Villa's first team. After seven Second Division games for Notts County, Tewkesbury returned to Aston Villa in January 1933, signing professional forms for the first time in his career. He played only one first-team game for Villa, and spent the 1935‚Äì36 season with Bradford Park Avenue, for whom he appeared in 14 Second Division games. He finished his Football League career with three seasons at Walsall, playing 75 Third Division South matches before retiring from the game in August 1939. Representative football Tewkesbury played for the Combined Universities from 1929, captaining the team in 1930, and frequently appeared for Amateur F.A. XIs in matches against the Oxford and Cambridge University clubs. In 1931 he turned out for leading amateur club Casuals. Tewkesbury made his international debut for the England amateur team on 15 November 1930 in Belfast against the Irish amateurs. Ireland won 3‚Äì1, but The Times' correspondent absolved him from blame for the goals. In the summer of 1931, he went on the Football Association's tour of Canada. Tewkesbury's sixth and last appearance for England, in March 1932, was also a 3‚Äì1 defeat, this time against Scotland's amateurs, and despite his saving a penalty. Personal Tewkesbury was born in Hove, Sussex, in 1909. He studied for a BSc degree at the University of Birmingham. He married the daughter of Birmingham F.C. director W. H. Bull, and went on to work for many years in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter. Ken C.Tewkesbury (B.Sc.) moved to Cornwall and took up residence at Roscarrack House, Budock, near Falmouth, where he took up his hobby in horticulture. He then volunteered his services to the newly formed Falmouth Town and was a pivotal figure in the club's early days and he was the team manager for the club's first three seasons in senior football. His Granddaughter Sarah Newton was elected as the local M.P. for the Truro and Falmouth constituency at the 2010 General Election. He returned to Birmingham and died in the city in 1970 at the age of 61.

Intelligence-Based Theory evidences the conterminous relationship between mind and matter, i.e. the direct neurological evaluations of surface, structure, pattern, texture and form. Intelligence-Based Theory maintains that our sense of well-being is established through neuro-engagement with the physical world at the deepest level common to all people i.e. \\"Innate Intelligence.\\" These precursory readings of the physical environment represent an evolved set of information processing skills that the human mind has developed over millennia through direct lived experience. This physiological engagement with the world operates in a more immediate sense than the summary events of applied meaning or intellectual speculation. It is through this direct neurological engagement that humans connect more fully with the world. Many of mankind's early religious associations with physical structures were informed by an intuitive understanding that structure and materials speak to our deeper self, i.e. the human spirit, the soul. Intelligence Based Theory reveals this effectual dimension of the built-environment and its relationship to human cognitive development, mental acuity, perceptual awareness, spirituality, and sense of well-being. It is within this realm that the mind's eye connects, or fails to connect, with the world outside. The degree of neuro-connectivity which occurs at these intervals serves to render the built-environment either intelligible or un-intelligible. The study and theory of this occurrence is known as \\"Intelligence-Based Design.\\" Antecedents Several distinct strands of design thinking, in parallel development, lead towards Intelligence-Based Design. Christopher Alexander contributed early on to the scientific approach to design, by proposing a theory of design in his book Notes on the synthesis of form. Those were the years when Artificial Intelligence was being developed by Herbert A. Simon, and Alexander was part of that movement. His later work A Pattern Language, although written for architects and urbanists, was picked up by the software community and used as a combinatorial and organizational rubric for software complexity, especially Design patterns (computer science). Alexander's most recent work The Nature of Order continues by building up a framework for design that relies upon natural and biological structures. Entirely separate from this, E. O. Wilson introduced the Biophilia hypothesis to describe the affinity of humans to other living structures, and to conjecture our innate need for such a connection. This topic was later investigated by Stephen R. Kellert and others, and applied to the design of the artificial environment. The third and independent component of the theory is the recent developments in mobile robotics by Rodney Brooks, where a breakthrough occurred by largely dispensing with internal memory. The practical concept of \\"Intelligence without representation\\" otherwise known as the Subsumption architecture and Behavior-based robotics introduced by Brooks suggests a parallel with the way human beings interact with, and design their own environment.

He joined Birmingham City as a trainee in 1979, and turned professional two years later. He made his first-team debut as a substitute in the League Cup in November 1991,Matthews, p. 227. and the following year spent time on loan at League of Ireland club Cobh Ramblers. Foy made his Football League debut in the First Division (second tier) on 13 February 1993 in a 3‚Äì2 home defeat to Portsmouth. He started the next two games,Matthews, p. 228. but soon afterwards was allowed to leave for Scunthorpe United on a free transfer. In his debut game he made a late goalline clearance which earned his club a 0‚Äì0 draw against Wrexham, but Scunthorpe released him at the end of the season and he joined Stafford Rangers. After something over a season in the Conference with Stafford, Foy joined Tamworth, where he spent seven years. In his final season the club narrowly failed to win the Southern League league title, and Foy, not selected for the last few games of the campaign, was frustrated by his inability to contribute. In May 2002 he left Tamworth for Worcester City. Foy damaged a cruciate ligament only ten games into his Worcester career, and his two years at the club was disrupted by injury. He spent the last few months of the 2003‚Äì04 season on loan to Halesowen Town before being released by Worcester. He joined Conference North club Moor Green, but by December 2004 was being loaned out to Stratford Town of the Midland Alliance, and moved on to Southern League Division One West club Bedworth United at the end of the season. However, Foy's domestic circumstances meant that in March 2006 he chose to make a permanent move to Stratford Town to reduce the amount of travelling required. After rejoining Stratford Town in 2008, Foy made a total of 51 appearances (39 in the league) across all three spells, scoring twice (both in the league).

SRIM is popular in the ion implantation research and technology community and also used widely in other branches of radiation material science. History SRIM originated in 1980 as a DOS based program then called TRIM. The DOS version was upgraded until 1998 and is still available for download. It will run on a Unix PC having a DOS emulator. SRIM-2000 requires a computer with any Windows operating system. The program may work with Unix or Macintosh based systems through Wine.SRIM plus Linux over Wine (SRIM+(LINUX/WINE))SRIM Wine Page @WineHQ The programs were developed by James F. Ziegler and Jochen P. Biersack around 1983 and are being continuously upgraded with the major changes occurring approximately every five years. SRIM is based on a Monte Carlo simulation method, namely the binary collision approximation with a random selection of the impact parameter of the next colliding ion. Operation As the input parameters, it needs the ion type and energy (in the range 10 eV ‚Äì 2 GeV) and the material of one or several target layers. As the output, it lists or plots the three-dimensional distribution of the ions in the solid and its parameters, such as penetration depth, its spread along the ion beam (called straggle) and perpendicular to it, all target atom cascades in the target are followed in detail; concentration of vacancies, sputtering rate, ionization, and phonon production in the target material; energy partitioning between the nuclear and electron losses, energy deposition rate; The programs are made so they can be interrupted at any time, and then resumed later. They have an easy-to-use user interface and built-in default parameters for all ions and materials. Another part of the software allows calculating the electronic stopping power of any ion in any material (including gaseous targets) based on an averaging parametrization of a vast range of experimental data. Those features made SRIM immensely popular. However, it doesn't take account of the crystal structure nor dynamic composition changes in the material that severely limits its usefulness in some cases. Other approximations of the program include binary collision (i.e. the influence of neighboring atoms is neglected); the material is fully amorphous, i.e. description of ion channeling effects is not possible, recombination of knocked off atoms (interstitials) with the vacancies, an effect known to be very important in heat spikes in metals, is neglected; There is no description of defect clustering and irradiation- induced amorphization, even though the former occurs in most materials and the latter is very important in semiconductors. The electronic stopping power is an averaging fit to a large number of experiments. and the interatomic potential as a universal form which is an averaging fit to quantum mechanical calculations, the target atom which reaches the surface can leave the surface (be sputtered) if it has momentum and energy to pass the surface barrier, which is a simplifying assumption that does not work well e.g. at energies below the surface penetration energy or if chemical effects are present. The system is layered, i.e. simulation of materials with composition differences in 2D or 3D is not possible. The threshold displacement energy is a step function for each element, even though in reality it is crystal-direction dependent.

The term was coined by David Morris Kipen, Director of Literature at the US National Endowment for the Arts. Outline In his 2006 book The Schreiber Theory: A Radical Rewrite of American Film History, Kipen says that the influential 1950s-era auteur theory has wrongly skewed analysis towards a director-centred view of film. In contrast, Kipen believes that the screenwriter has a greater influence on the quality of a finished work and that knowing who wrote a film is \\"the surest predictor\\" of how good it will be: > A filmgoer seeking out pictures written by, say, Eric Roth or Charlie > Kaufman won't always see a masterpiece, but he'll see fewer clunkers than he > would following even a brilliant director like John Boorman, or an > intelligent actor like Jeff Goldblum. It's all a matter of betting on the > fastest horse, instead of the most highly touted or the prettiest.Kipen, > David (2006). The Schreiber Theory: A Radical Rewrite of American Film > History, p.38. Melville House . Kipen acknowledges that his writer-centred approach is not new, and he pays tribute to earlier critics of auteur theory such as Pauline Kael and Richard Corliss. He believes that the auteurist approach remains dominant, however, and that films have suffered as a result of the screenwriter's role being undervalued. Kipen refers to his book as a \\"manifesto\\" and in an interview with the magazine SF360 stated that he wished to use Schreiber theory as \\"a lever to change the way people think about screenwriting, and movies in general\\". Origin of term In seeking a name for his theory, Kipen chose the Yiddish word for writer ‚Äì Schreiber ‚Äì in honor of the many early American screenwriters who had Yiddish as their mother tongue. Kipen, David (2006). The Schreiber Theory: A Radical Rewrite of American Film History, p.37. Melville House . Criticism Writing in Variety, Diane Garrett said Kipen shows a degree of disingenuousness when he states that Schreiberism is \\"an attempt to rescue reviewing and scholarship from those who would have us forget just how collaborative filmmaking truly is\\". She said, \\"If that's really the goal, why spend 150 pages arguing for the supremacy of the writer? Instead say what you really mean: Don't forget the writer, please\\".Diane Garrett. \\"Book Review: The Schreiber Theory\\". Variety, April 15, 2006. In an interview with Kipen, film writer Michael Fox said Schreiberism seemed less an attempt to discredit auteur theory outright than a ploy to \\"simply shift the auteur appellation from directors to screenwriters\\". Kipen's reply was that there was an element of \\"parody\\" in his writer-centred theory, in that he hoped to \\"overcorrect\\" the director-centred model in such a way that \\"the final average of the two is a more realistic representation\\".Michael Fox. \\"Author!

It is located beneath the Nuevos Ministerios (New Ministries) government complex and the AZCA financial centre at the junction of the Paseo de la Castellana and Joaqu√≠n Costa and Raimundo Fern√°ndez Villaverde streets in Madrid, Spain. It services the districts of Tetu√°n, Chamber√≠, and Chamart√≠n. The station serves Metro Line 6, Line 8, and Line 10, as well as Cercan√≠as Lines C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-7, C-8, and C-10. It is located in Metro fare zone A and Cercan√≠as fare zone 0.  History  The railway station currently used by Cercan√≠as Madrid was inaugurated on 18 July 1967 as part of the original Atocha‚ÄìChamart√≠n Rail Tunnel. The tunnel connected the long-distance rail stations of Chamart√≠n and Atocha, and was popularly called the T√∫nel de la risa (Laughing Tunnel) due to its perceived similarity to an amusement park attraction. The Metro station opened twelve years later on 10 October 1979 when the first segment of Line 6 was inaugurated, running from Cuatro Caminos to Pac√≠fico and including a stop at Nuevos Ministerios. The Metro and Cercan√≠as stations are connected underground with hallways. On 10 June 1982, a second set of platforms was added to the Metro station when the first segment of the old Line 8 was inaugurated, running from Fuencarral to Nuevos Ministerios. In 1986, the old Line 8 was extended from Nuevos Ministerios to Avenida de Am√©rica. However, in 1996, work began on a project to connect Line 10 and Line 8, absorbing Line 8 into Line 10, and Line 8 service between Nuevos Ministerios and Avenida de Am√©rica was suspended. On 22 January 1998, the new combined Line 10 was opened, connecting the station to Fuencarral in the north and Aluche in the south. In 2001, the Line 10 platforms were closed while Line 10 was converted from narrow-profile to wide-profile trains. Also in 2001, work began on a project to extend the current Line 8 to Nuevos Ministerios, providing more direct access from downtown Madrid to the Adolfo Su√°rez Madrid‚ÄìBarajas Airport, which is located on Line 8. The Line 8 platforms were inaugurated in 2002. Between 2002 and 2006, the station featured a service allowing passengers to check in for selected flights at Nuevos Ministerios and then board a train to the airport. The service was ultimately abandoned for security reasons. On 9 July 2008, a second tunnel was added to the Atocha‚ÄìChamart√≠n Rail Tunnel, increasing the number of Cercan√≠as platforms to six. As of 2011, the station offers service on the Cercan√≠as C-1 Line to Aeropuerto T4, meaning there are two direct rail services between Nuevos Ministerios and Barajas Airport.

Saint Louis University is a highly ranked Jesuit institution with campuses in St. Louis, Missouri, and Madrid, Spain. SLU-Madrid offers fully accredited American undergraduate and graduate degrees that can be completed in Spain or combined with studies at the St. Louis campus. The student body at SLU-Madrid comprises approximately 850 students from over 50 countries. English is the language of instruction, with selected courses offered in Spanish. The average class size is 17, and the student to faculty ratio is 12:1. Accreditation Saint Louis University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) and has been continuously accredited since 1916.(n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.hlcommission.org/component/directory/?Itemid=&Action;=ShowBasic&instid;=1459 The most recent accreditation approval was issued in 2012 following a three- year intensive self-study carried out by a set of university-wide committees, including a subcommittee of the Madrid Campus. The Institutional Actions Council (IAC) of the HLC voted to continue the accreditation of Saint Louis University, with the next comprehensive evaluation set for 2021-22. The university has also attained accreditation from appropriate professional bodies for specific programs; for example, the Richard A. Chaifetz School of Business, through which the Madrid Campus offers its International Business program, is accredited by AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), the premier business school accrediting body. Engineering degrees are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). History The Madrid Campus was founded in 1967 by Raymond L. Sullivant as a study abroad program. Classes were offered in conjunction with the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, a Spanish Jesuit institution. The success of the study abroad program led Sullivant to develop an independent, permanent program, with administrative offices and classrooms located between Madrid's Complutense University and the city center. Shortly thereafter, a number of Spanish students, attracted to the university's liberal arts curriculum, enrolled in classes. Within a decade, SLU-Madrid was home to hundreds of students. As the programs expanded, students were able to complete the first two years of their undergraduate studies in Madrid. By 2005, students were able to complete all four years of their degree and graduate in Madrid. In 1990, SLU-Madrid acquired Padre Rubio and Padre Arrupe Halls. In 1996, the university became the first U.S. institution to receive official recognition from the Consejer√≠a de Educaci√≥n y Deporte, Madrid's higher education authority. In 2011, the university expanded the Madrid Campus further with the acquisition and renovation of San Ignacio Hall, providing additional space to support students and faculty, including a new library, cafeteria and auditorium. Today, students from more than 50 countries pursue undergraduate and graduate courses at SLU-Madrid. The campus offers four-year undergraduate degrees and graduate degrees, and hosts study abroad students from more than 150 universities in the U.S. and worldwide. Recognized as a center of international education in Spain, SLU-Madrid remains committed to the ideals of service and leadership that the university, its students, faculty, and staff have upheld since 1818, when the St. Louis Campus was founded. Facilities Facade of SLU-Madrid Campus, Padre Arrupe Hall Padre Arrupe Hall houses administrative and faculty offices, classrooms, and biology, chemistry, computer, nursing and physics labs. Padre Rubio Hall, the main academic building, features additional classrooms, the Office of Student Life, student lounges, the bookstore and St. Timothy's Chapel. San Ignacio Hall, acquired in 2011, is home to an auditorium, art, dance and music studios, additional classrooms, a full-service cafeteria and dining room, the library, faculty offices and a rooftop terrace. In addition to over 10,000 volumes that are available in the Madrid library, students in Madrid have access to the vast collection of electronic resources and databases owned by Saint Louis University. Billiken The Billiken is Saint Louis University's distinctive mascot and has been for 100 years.

SLU-Madrid also hosts visiting students from over 150 universities across the United States and around the world. Study abroad students choose from more than 200 courses each semester, including classes in engineering, health sciences and other non-traditional study abroad fields. Postgraduate education Padre Rubio Hall SLU-Madrid offers two M.A. programs: *Political Science and Public Affairs with a concentration in International Relations and Crisis *Spanish Students may fulfill all requirements for the M.A. programs in Madrid, or through a combination of study at the Madrid Campus and the St. Louis Campus. The M.A. in Political Science was developed by Madrid faculty in response to the increasing number, intensity and impact of international crises in recent years. The program is designed for students holding an undergraduate degree in political science, international relations or a related field, and who are interested in developing a deeper understanding of key contemporary crises. The M.A. in Spanish program focuses on Spanish and Latin American language, culture and literature. The program can be completed over the course of three or four summers, or during the academic year. The program is designed for holders of a B.A. in Spanish or a related field, language educators, and literary scholars. Campus life The Office of Student Life sponsors a wide range of extracurricular activities, both on and off campus, including trips that deepen students‚Äô cultural understanding of Spain or that complement their studies by taking them to destinations around Spain, Europe, and Africa. Clubs include the Student Government Association, the Gay-Straight Alliance, the International Relations Society, Poker Club, the Glee Club, Film Club, Debate Club, among others. Campus Ministry organizes a program of activities for exploring faith and a commitment to social justice. Each semester, the university sponsors a retreat to Loyola, the birthplace of St. Ignatius, the founder of the Jesuit order. The Ignatian Community Council organizes panel discussions, service projects, documentary film viewings, and interfaith activities to encourage dialogue within the diverse religious community on campus and address the tough issues of social justice the world faces today. In keeping with the Jesuit mission of the university, SLU-Madrid offers its students, faculty and staff opportunities for living out their identity as \\"men and women for others\\" through community service and outreach. Volunteers collaborate with dozens of local NGOs. Projects include teaching English to hearing-impaired children, serving meals in a soup kitchen, and raising money for the Red Cross. SLU-Madrid offers career counseling, practice interviews, r√©sum√© critiques and workshops/ networking events on campus.

Later he was a nonconformist preacher. Life He matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 14 February 1623, aged 12, graduated B.A. on 25 November 1626, M.A. on 11 June 1629, and B.D. on 16 November 1638. He preached in and about Oxford; for a sermon attacking some of the ceremonies of the church, preached at St. Mary's on 6 September 1640, Wilkinson was suspended from his divinity lecture, and from all his priestly functions in the university until he should recant. He appealed to the Long parliament, and in December 1640 was restored by the committee of religion of that body, who ordered the sermon to be printed. Subsequently, Wilkinson moved to London, was appointed minister of St. Faith's under St. Paul's, chosen a member of the Westminster Assembly, and in 1645 became rector of St. Dunstan's-in-the-East. In 1646 he was one of the six preachers despatched by the Long parliament to Oxford, where he was chosen senior fellow of Magdalen, and deputed a parliamentary visitor. On 12 April 1648 he was appointed canon of Christ Church on the expulsion of Dr. Thomas Iles. He was created D.D. on 24 July 1649, and elected Lady Margaret professor of divinity on 12 July 1652, which office he filled until 1662. In 1654 he served on the commission for ejecting scandalous ministers from Oxfordshire. He was known in Oxford as 'Long Harry' or 'senior' to distinguish him from another Henry Wilkinson (1616‚Äì1690) known as 'Dean Harry'. After the Restoration he was ejected from his professorship by the king's commissioners and left Oxford. Wilkinson preached first at All Hallows, Lombard Street, and afterwards at Clapham. A conventicle of sixty or more persons to whom he was preaching was broken up at Camberwell in August 1665. After the 'indulgence' he took out a licence on 2 April 1672 for his house or the schoolhouse at Clapham to be a presbyterian meeting-house. He was well known around London as a preacher, and when he died on 5 June 1675. either at Deptford or Putney, his body was conducted by many hundreds of persons to Drapers' Hall, and thence to its burial in St. Dunstan's Church. Some of his sermons were published in Samuel Annesley's Morning Exercise, 1661, and Supplement, 1674 (republished in 1844). Family He was the son of Henry Wilkinson (\\"the elder\\") (1566‚Äì1647), by his wife Sarah, and was born at Waddesdon, Buckinghamshire, on 4 March 1610. His father, who was elected fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1586, was created B.D. on 7 July 1597, and was from 1601 till his death on 19 March 1647 rector of Waddesdon. He was chosen one of the Westminster divines in 1643; he published A Catechism (4th edit. London, 1637), and The Debt Book, or a Treatise upon Rom. xiii. 8 (London, 1625). By his wife Sarah, daughter of Arthur Wake of Salcey Forest, Northamptonshire, and sister of Sir Isaac Wake, he had six sons and three daughters. According to Anthony √† Wood Henry married 'a woman called the lady Carr,' and in his will he mentions one son and two daughters.

Its purpose was to improve rail access from Midlands and northern population centres to the seaside resorts at Skegness, Sutton-on-Sea and Mablethorpe. It was built by the Great Northern Railway (GNR), and opened as a double track line in 1913. It was authorised under a Light Railway Order, which simplified the legal process. Long distance holiday and excursion passenger trains to the east coast resports were routed over the line, which also carried an ordinary rural passenger and goods service. During World War I, the materials from one track were lifted and sent to France for tactical use there. The track was reinstated and normal operation was resumed in 1923. When the direct line from Lincoln to Boston was closed east of Coningsby Junction in 1960, some Lincoln stopping trains ran to Coningsby to terminate their journeys. The New Line itself was closed on 5 October 1970.Stewart E Squires, The Lost Railways of Lincolnshire, Castlemead Publications, Ware, 1986 , pages 38 and 39 Before the New Line The Kirkstead New LineIn 1848 the Great Northern Railway opened two main lines: part of its Loop Line (or Lincolnshire Loop) from Boston to Lincoln, and the East Lincolnshire Line from Boston to Grimsby. The GNR leased the East Lincolnshire Line from the owning company. From the 1860s seaside holidays and excursions became increasingly popular, and a nominally independent branch line was opened from Firsby to Skegness in 1873.Stephen Walker, Firsby to Wainfleet and Skegness, KMS Books, Boston, 1987, , page 7 Mablethorpe was connected to the East Lincolnshire Line at Louth in 1877 and additionally at Willoughby further south, in 1888. The railway connections encouraged the huge popularity of the seaside, and the towns and the railways did excellent business in the season. The approach to Skegness and Mablethorpe from the Midlands was rather circuitous, involving a sweep through Boston, reversing there in the case of trains running via Lincoln. Demand for a quicker route Although the GNR thought it had treated Skegness well, the Town Council approached the GNR chairman in November 1910, asking for a better passenger train service from Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds. They suggested a new line from Spilsby to or through Horncastle, shortening the journey to Lincoln and beyond. They said they would ask the Midland Railway, which ran to Lincoln from Nottingham, for help if the GNR would not do something. The GNR board undertook to investigate an alternative new line, and promised improved services. In the summer of 1911, the long distance trains were indeed improved and accelerated.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume III: Twentieth Century to Grouping, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1981, , pages 113 and 114 In April, the Board noted that a light railway from Kirkstead to Little Steeping would give a more direct route from the north, Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincoln, avoiding the Boston reversal. The estimated cost was ¬£207,164; the board approved this scheme. The Light Railway Commissioners held an inquiry at Boston on 18 July, and granted the order, and this was confirmed on 27 December 1911. The light railway authorisation did not impose any particular restrictions on the operation of the line when completed, but merely streamlined the legal authorisation process in non-controversial situations. No time was lost in getting on with the construction of the line. A tender from a Mr Arnold for the earthworks and track in the amount of ¬£93,993 was accepted in February 1912. McKenzie and Holland supplied the signals.Wrottesley, volume 3, page 126 Opening The line was 15 miles in length; it was built as a double line. It opened for all traffic on 1 July 1913.Wrottesley says 1 August 1913.Squires, pages 86 to 89Wrottesley, volume 3, page 131Paul Anderson, Railways of Lincolnshire, Irwell Press, Oldham, 1992, , page 55 There were stations at Coningsby, Tumby Woodside, New Bolingbroke, Stickney and Midville. In summer through carriages from Manchester and Sheffield, and the Leeds train, were diverted to the new route, besides services to Sutton-on-Sea and Mablethorpe. Local traffic was always slight, usually four trains each way daily between Lincoln and Skegness. It was immediately dubbed \\"The New Line\\" by railwaymen, and so it remained for all its life. World War I During World War I heavy holiday traffic continued to the Lincolnshire coastal resorts in the 1915 and 1916 summers. The Kirkstead and Little Steeping line was less than two years old, and its passenger service was reduced to two each way by May 1915, but a daily Lincoln-Skegness through train continued throughout the war.Wrottesley, volume 3, page 142 There was pressure to release track materials considered to be able to be spared, for use in France as part of the war effort. The GNR board decided to lift one of the two tracks on the Kirkstead-Little Steeping line for the purpose.Wrottesley, volume 3, page 145 Squires says that the line was \\"closed as part of the railway's effort to reduce their consumption of coal. Relaying of the missing track began in June 1922, and the line reopened the following year,\\"Squires, page 88 and Leleux says that the line was \\"closed between 1915 and 1923 as a coal economy measure\\".Robin Leleux, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 9: The East Midlands, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1976, , page 205 These statements appear to be mistaken; the line seems never to have closed, merely to have been singled. Anderson says \\"every station remained open\\" and Quick, usually meticulous in temporary closures, does not show any suspension.Michael Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England, Scotland and Wales: A Chronology, the Railway and Canal Historical Society, Richmond, Surrey, 2002 After 1945 After World War II the popularity of the seaside resorts at Skegness, Mablethorpe and Sutton on Sea was restored, and through holiday trains resumed in summer. Nevertheless, the ordinary traffic of the district declined as passenger and goods transport transferred to roads. It was the line from Coningsby Junction to Boston that closed first, on 17 June 1963, due to an accumulated backlog of track and signalling renewals, the cost of which was considered insupportable in the context of the line's earnings. RAF Coningsby was still a busy RAF station generating a significant passenger traffic, and trains from Lincoln were diverted to Coningsby or Tumby Woodside to serve the RAF passengers, who would otherwise have used Dogdyke; there were three such trains daily. For the time being the Skegness ordinary passenger trains continued. Goods facilities were withdrawn on 30 March 1964. As an economy measure, the stations on the New Line became unstaffed halts from 7 October 1968; tickets were issued on the train by conductor guards. By 1970, Tumby Woodside was the terminus for three trains each way daily from Lincoln, the remainder of the branch served only by four Lincoln to Firsby trains, and three in the opposite direction. The New Line clsoed on 5 October 1970, along with most of the rest of the East Lincolnshire network. Residual structures It was reported in 2010 that Tumby Woodside station buildings were still standing, but in derelict and dangerous condition. The station was referred to in 1964 in the song \\"Slow Train\\" by Flanders and Swann. At that time New Bolingbroke station's up platform and building still survived, and hosted an antiques centre and a reclaim yard on the down platform.

This revision also provided the opportunity to move from the classical chronostratigraphy used back in the 1960s to the lithostratigraphy that is currently more prevalent. Unit names and specific localities are suggested for the new dispensation. The use of satellite imagery and Global Positioning System (GPS) has provided an unprecedented precision. Data recovered from oil and water exploratory boreholes has produced an in depth knowledge of the subsurface and a new understanding of the tectonics, resulting in the discovery of previously unknown faults. The mineral resources in the area covered by the three maps are predominantly phosphates, limestone and palygorskite. However, the potential for clay, dolomite, heavy minerals and building gravel merits also to be considered.

Moving from the chronostratigraphy to the prevalent lithostratigraphy renders the terms of Continental terminal and Formation jaune obsolete and it is suggested to replace them with the designations Saloum Formation and Kaedi Member respectively. Identification of aeolian sands was completed with an attempt to age their deposition. Careful attention was applied to the recognition of fluvial deposits while distinguishing between the meander sands from the clay and the potentially cultivable silt of the settling basins. The mineral resources of the Matam area include proven reserves of high-grade phosphate as well as possible reserves of arenaceous dolomite. These two resources, coupled with availability of fresh river water, now protected from the tides by the Diama Dam, should improve the potential for agricultural development in the valley.

Both genera lived during the Miocene, approximately 12 million years ago. Fossil specimens named by Salvador Moy√†-Sol√† Anoiapithecus brevirostris are known from the deposits from Spain.. The discoverers described Anoiapithecus brevirostris as a hominoid (superfamily Hominoidea) in the dryopithecine tribe. They believe that it has more modern traits than the Kenyapithecines from which Kenya's Kenyapithecus wickeri brings fragmentary information. The African specimens are considered a sister taxon to the hominids, and 2 million years younger European specimens must be from the time after these two groups split. This means that hominids may have evolved in Europe. The name comes from the Anoia River region in Catalonia, where the fossil was found. It has been given the nickname Lluc (since it is a male individual). The name Lluc is the Catalan form of Luke, which in Latin suggests \\"light\\", as this discovery enlighted our early evolution. The modern anatomical features that characterized the family Hominidae visible in Lluc's fossil among others are: unique facial pattern for hominoids, nasal aperture wide at the base, high cheek bone, and deep palate.

She was the first wife of Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury. One of her brothers was Edmund Holland, 4th Earl of Kent, to whom she was co-heiress. She is not to be confused with her eldest sister Alianore Holland, Countess of March who bore the same name. Family Lady Eleanor Holland was born in 1386 in Upholland, Lancashire, England, one of the ten children of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent and Lady Alice FitzAlan, sister of Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel. Eleanor's eldest sister, Lady Alianore Holland, Countess of March who married Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March shared the same name. They were named after their maternal grandmother.Note. It is likely that at the time of Eleanor's birth, her eldest sister Alianore was not expected to live. Antonia Fraser, on page 443 in her book, The Wives of Henry VIII, explains that in the Middle Ages, a newborn baby was sometimes named for an older sibling of the same sex who had died or was expected to die. Eleanor's father was a uterine half-brother of King Richard II. Her eldest brother Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey was beheaded in 1400 by a mob of angry citizens at Cirencester for his role in the Epiphany Rising, which was aimed against the life of King Henry IV of England, who had usurped the throne of King Richard. Thomas's heir to the earldom of Kent was her second eldest brother Edmund Holland, to whom Eleanor became co-heiress. Her paternal grandparents were Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent and Joan of Kent, who was the mother of King Richard by her second marriage to Edward, the Black Prince; and her maternal grandparents were Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel and Eleanor of Lancaster. Bisham Manor, the home of Eleanor Holland and Thomas Montacute. Marriage and issue Lady Eleanor married Sir Thomas Montagu, son of John Montagu, 3rd Earl of Salisbury and Maud Francis, on 23 May 1399, as his first wife. She was about thirteen years old at the time of her marriage. Thomas would later become one of the most important commanders in the Hundred Years War. Eleanor did not assume the title of Countess of Salisbury until 14 June 1409, when the title, Earl of Salisbury, was nominally restored to Thomas.Charles Cawley, Medieval Lands, Earls of Salisbury 1337‚Äì1462) (Montagu) An attainder had been placed on his father's title and estates following his execution for his participation in the Epiphany Rising in 1400 alongside Eleanor's brother, Thomas. Eleanor's uncle John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter had also been part of the conspiracy but he had escaped the mob only to be captured in Essex and decapitated on the orders of her maternal aunt Joan Fitzalan, mother-in-law of King Henry IV. Thomas and Eleanor made their home at Bisham Manor in Berkshire. Together they had one daughter: * Alice Montagu, 5th Countess of Salisbury (1407-3 April/9 December 1462), married in 1420, Richard Neville, by whom she had ten surviving children.David Baldwin.

Alice, the daughter of Thomas and Eleanor, succeeded her father as suo jure 5th Countess of Salisbury.

From 1738 to 1744 he won much success in London's art market and among Italophile noblemen back from their Grand Tour, being preferred to both English portrait practice (fluctuating between Rococo and Kneller-like styles) and to other Italian portraitists in England at the time, such as the Cavaliere Rusca (worked in London 1738‚Äì39), and Andrea Casali (worked in London 1741‚Äì66). Beginning \\"above thirty portraits\\" from April to August 1738 alone (according to Vertue), Soldi's only serious rival was Jean- Baptiste van Loo (in London 1737‚Äì42).

She appeared on Broadway and in early sound films, including the Paramount Pictures films Paramount on Parade and Follow Thru (both 1930). She was born in Rock Falls, Illinois, on May 29, 1903, and moved to Chicago at the age of two. She attended public schools until she was fourteen, when she went to work in a factory and later took office jobs. She worked occasionally in vaudeville, at first without pay and later professionally as a vaudeville act with her sister Berenice and a piano player. Her touring brought her to the East Coast, where she was cast in Good News. Of her appearance in that musical comedy set on a college campus, Brooks Atkinson wrote in the New York Times in 1927: \\"one pert young freshman, Zelma O'Neal, dances herself into willing exhaustion to the snapping tune of 'The Varsity Drag'.\\" In a profile, the paper referred to \\"her personality, which experts say resembles that of a caged cyclone\\". She was part of the cast that took Good News to London in 1928. There she met British actor Anthony Bushell. She returned to New York for a role in the musical Follow Thru. She married Bushell in New York on November 22, 1928. He was appearing on Broadway in Maugham's The Sacred Flame. Follow Thru opened in January 1929 and proved a hit. It ran almost a full year. In it she and Jack Haley sang \\"Button Up Your Overcoat\\". Atkinson wrote: She appeared in the West Coast production of the show in Los Angeles in October 1929, and she stayed there to make her first films. In the spring of 1930, she and her husband took a delayed honeymoon trip to Germany, France, and England. She appeared in a vaudeville in November, where her performance was well received: \\"In appearance the buoyant Miss O'Neal has become quite ladylike after a sojourn in, of all places to acquire that, Hollywood. Naturally she has lost some of her gamin quality, but she is sufficiently old-style in her renditions of \\"Button Up Your Overcoat\\" and \\"Varsity Drag\\", and delights her audience with an excellent act.\\" She opened in The Gang's All Here in February 1931, but the show received poor notices‚Äì\\"Seldom has a lavish musical stage production struggled so clumsily to reconcile a satiric book with the antics of clowns who ask for nothing so much as space and freedom on the stage.\\"‚Äì and closed after three weeks. O'Neal and Bushell relocated to London in 1932, where she established a second stage career. When the New York Times reported in December 1934 that she was announced for the cast of Jack O'Diamonds that would tour England before opening in London, it commented: \\"That should relieve a lot of people who haven't been able to locate Miss O'Neal since the days of The Gang's All Here in 1931\\". The play opened to good notices in London in February 1935, and the Telegraph wrote of O'Neal: \\"She's that very rare thing‚Äìan attractive woman who doesn't mind making a fool of herself.\\" They divorced in 1935. Following their divorce, they appeared in the same show at least once, though they did not appear together on stage. O'Neal appeared in Swing Along in Manchester and London in 1936. She returned to New York on the Hamburg in June 1937. She retired in 1938. Dorothy Lee, her co-star in Peach O'Reno explained: \\"Zelma was great on stage, but like a lot of stage performers, something was lost when she stepped in front of the camera. ... She sure had talent but it didn't always register on film.\\" She also said \\"A million dollar personality, and twenty five cent looks\\" She published her reminiscences in 1984: Memoirs from Scotts Hill. She died in Largo, Florida, on November 3, 1989; upon her death, she was cremated.

Life Having attended Trinity College, Dublin from 1694, he was working at the Drury Lane Theatre by spring 1703 with Christopher Rich. He also adapted Moli√®re's L'amour m√©decin as The Quacks, putting it on at the Drury Lane Theatre on 29 March 1705. With the rest of Rich's party, he was evicted from Drury Lane in 1709 by William Collier. In the meantime, in 1706, he had leased the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket from Sir John Vanbrugh, quarrelled with Rich and poached Colley Cibber from him. After initial success with plays and opera there, Collier's court intrigues against Swiny led to his bankruptcy by January 1713. He then went travelling in France, the Netherlands and Italy, settling in Venice by 1721 as an agent signing Italian opera talent and works for the London stage and commissioning works from Italian artists for collectors back in England - those artists included Antonio Canaletto (on whose arrival in England in 1746 he introduced to the duke of Richmond) and Rosalba Carriera. With Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond as the project's main patron, Swiny got together a Venetian- Bolognese team of painters (including Piazzetta, Sebastiano and Marco Ricci, Canaletto, G. B. Pittoni, Giovanni Battista Cimaroli, Donato Creti and Francesco Monti) in the 1720s to produce a series of 24 tomb paintings with allegories of recent English history, especially the Glorious Revolution. He tried to have the paintings engraved in a single volume, publishing the prospectus To the Ladies and Gentlemen of Taste of Great Britain and Ireland in the 1730s to try to raise the funding for this by subscription. When the volume finally came out in 1741, as Tombeaux des princes, grands capitaines et autres hommes illustr√©s, qui ont fleuri dans la Grande-Bretagne vers la fin du XVII et le commencement du XVIII si√®cle, it included only 9 of the paintings, but Swiny still planned a second series of six such paintings on the duke of Marlborough's deeds that remained incomplete on his death. In around 1733, after about 20 years abroad, Swiny came back to London, where he won posts in the custom house and as storekeeper at the king's mews. Benefit nights for him followed in 1735 and 1736, with the Opera of the Nobility's directors in 1736 considering sending him back to Italy to recruit singers. In 1737 he sat for his portrait from Peter van Bleeck, and the following year Jean Baptiste van Loo and Andrea Soldi also painted him. In around 1749 Swiny made a trip to Paris for John Rich, to arrange the London tour of Jean Monnet's troupe, before dying in London in 1754 and being buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields. His estate was left in trust for the actress Margaret (Peg) Woffington (for whose benefit his large paintings collection was also sold, in 1755), with his will leaving as trustees Robert Maxwell (secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland) and Francis Andrews (a lawyer and fellow of Trinity College, Dublin).

Construction began in 1986, using plans drawn by Scottish architect J.L. Gleave in 1931. In time for the 500th anniversary of Columbus's first voyage, the monument was inaugurated in 1992. It was funded by the Latin American states\\"O√π est donc enterr√© Christophe Colomb ?\\" Cristobal-colon.net. Retrieved June 4, 2009Le phare de Christophe Colomb Entre2voyages.com Retrieved June 4, 2009 and the total cost of construction was approximately US$70 million. The monument's lighthouse-style features projecting beams of light, forming a cross shape, which are so powerful that they can be seen from neighboring Puerto Rico. According to the Dominican authorities, remains of Christopher Columbus are sheltered at the lighthouse. However, Spanish authorities have proved through DNA tests that the remains in the Cathedral of Seville are the real remains of Columbus. The Dominican authorities haven't allowed the same DNA tests to be done to the remains in the lighthouse, so it is impossible to know if the remains of Columbus are divided or if the remains in the lighthouse belonged to another person. The monument is both a mausoleum and a museum showcasing objects, including a boat from Cuba and Colombian jewelry. Constructed of concrete, the monument is long. Its architecture is cross-shaped and represents the Christianization of the Americas. Architecture The Columbus Lighthouse is a cross-shaped monument made of reinforced concrete. Its dimensions are by . There are 157 beams of light that emanate towards the sky from the structure and a rotating beam, which can be seen from space. History Columbus Tomb at Columbus Lighthouse, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic The Dominican historian Antonio Delmonte y Tejada, in his book History of Santo Domingo, published in 1852, expressed the idea of erecting a monument in honor of Columbus in Santo Domingo. In 1914, the American, Pulliam William Ellis, began selling the idea of building a monumental beacon in the first city of the New World to the American press. The idea became universally accepted during the 1923 celebration of the Fifth International Conference in Chile, when it was decreed that this monument should be built in cooperation by all governments and peoples of the Americas. Scottish architect Joseph Lea Gleave won the competition among 455 participants from 48 countries. The ceremony was held in Brazil in 1931, and the judges included distinguished architects, such as Horacio Acosta y Lara (Uruguay), Eliel Saarinen (Finland), and Frank Lloyd Wright (USA). However, by 1950, only eight countries had made contributions, totaling less than $15,000. Yet, the Dominican government forged ahead with the project, and in 1948, the foundations of the monument were inaugurated. After 1948, there was growing instability in the country and the political situation made it impossible to resume construction, until 1986. During the government of Joaqu√≠n Balaguer, construction resumed under the supervision of the Dominican architect Te√≥filo Carbonell, and culminated in the construction of the monument in 1992; in time for the celebration of the quincentennial discovery of the Americas. The monument, though originally conceived by Gleave as a mausoleum, was adapted to house a permanent collection of exhibitions from each country of the Americas, as well as other European and Asian countries, as requested by former President Balaguer.

Beienrode is ca. 35 km eastward from Braunschweig. The village is directly up to the Autobahn A2 between Hannover and Berlin. The town of Beienrode accommodates about 545 residents and belongs to the city of K√∂nigslutter am Elm. Landscape Beienrode is mainly marked by the river vallies of the Uhrau and Schunter. The small river Schunter flows, with a breadth of 6 m (19,6 ft), at the western border of the village. In the north hits the Schunter the beck of Uhrau. Further southwestern the river of Lutter open out into the Schunter close to the nature reserve Lutterlandbruch. The mountain range of Dorm, with the highest elevation of the Fuchsberg 182 m (597 ft), is in the southeastern bottom of Beienrode. History The 600-year-old chapel of Beienrode The first mention of Beienrode was at September 10, 980 as Bodenrod. The German emperor Otto II donated the Saxonian Derlingau, with Beienrode, to his abider Mamecho. The old part of Beienrode, the so-called Unterdorf, was in the river valley of the Schunter and originally a small farming village, surrounding the 1000-year-old manor. The Oberdorf was developed with the potash salt mine in the beginning of the 20th century. After World War I, the mine works were stopped. Beienrode was a village close to the former inter-German border, off to the checkpoint Helmstedt-Marienborn. In fact of this distance, Beienrode was in the structurally weak place in the area adjacent to the Soviet Zone. Today Beienrode is a countrified village of commuters with round about 500 residents. =The potash salt winning= From 1900 until 1926 Beienrode had his biggest economic time with the potash salt mining. With the discovery of the artificial fertilizer in the end of the 19th century, potash salt became high status. Until the end of World War I, the German Empire was the only mining country for potash. In 1892 was the beginning of mining in Beienrode. The population of the small village increased up to 845 residents. By courtesy of worldwide discoveries of potash deposits, the German Empire lost their monopoly. In fact of that, the mine in Beienrode was closed. Until 1966 the mine was always ready for operation. After that time, all shaft towers were busted and the galleries were fled. Only the old water reservoir tower, the director's villa and the laboratory still exist. Facilities Entrance of the manor Today in the manor is a diaconia care home Haus der helfenden H√§nde (House of helping hands) for old people with different diseases. This facility were founded in 1949 as an aid organization for evangelic refugees from East Prussia. After a radical sanitation of the fa√ßade and the interior, the manor's care home capacity were expanded to 80 people.

Career In November 1957, the British music magazine, NME, reported that Steele's manager, Larry Parnes had signed up Hicks, and that Hicks would undertake a ten-week variety tour with Marty Wilde. In March the following year, the same source stated that Hicks and Wilde were fulfilling contracted dates, left after Terry Dene had been diagnosed as unfit to continue touring. In 1958 they had some television appearances, and a recording contract with Pye Records, and released a few singles with the label. However, he did not achieve the same level of success as his brother. In 1959 they appeared in the Italian film, Europe By Night, with the song \\"Giddy Up a Ding Dong\\" that became a hit for them in Italy and resulted in an invitation to tour there. They became popular there and recorded several singles for the Broadway label in Italy. In the early 1960s just before a concert in Torino, Hicks became ill and lost his voice, and his backing group at the time consisting of Shel Shapiro, Johnny Charlton, Bobby Posner and Mike Shepstone were persuaded by a manager in Italy to sever ties with Hicks which they did. They then became The Rokes, and started playing behind the Italian female singer Rita Pavone. However they were signed to RCA Italiana on their own and debuted with a single, a cover version of \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\". They also hold a distinction of being the first foreign rock band to play in a socialist state (in Yugoslavia in 1960).

Official Historian Gavin Long described him as \\"perhaps the clearest and most profound thinker the Australian Army of his generation had produced.\\" Wynter joined the Australian Army as a reservist in 1907 before becoming a regular officer in 1911. On duty in Queensland when the Great War broke out in 1914, he joined the 11th Infantry Brigade in 1916 as its brigade major. He served on a series of staff posts on the Western Front. After the war attended the Staff College, Camberley and Imperial Defence College. Wynter's public criticism of the government's Singapore strategy led to his being reduced in rank and sent to Queensland. In 1938 he assumed command of the Army Command and Staff College. In 1940 he accepted a reduction in rank to become the Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster General of I Corps. Wynter embarked for the Middle East in May 1940 with the advance party of I Corps but the convoy he was travelling with was diverted to the United Kingdom. He was appointed to command the AIF there, with a key role in the defence of southern England. In October 1940 his force became the nucleus of a new 9th Division, which he was appointed to command. Ill-health forced him to return to Australia, where he became Lieutenant General Administration. Education and early life Henry Douglas Wynter was born on 5 June 1886 at Gin Gin, Queensland, the sixth surviving child of Henry Philip Walter Wynter, a sugarcane farmer, and his Maria Louisa n√©e Maunsell. He was educated at Maryborough Grammar School, where he served in the Australian Army Cadets. Wynter was a lieutenant of Cadets from 1 July 1906 to 2 February 1907. On 26 February 1907 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in a Militia unit, the Wide Bay Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to lieutenant on 24 March 1908 and captain on 24 June 1909. On 1 February 1911 Wynter transferred to the Administrative and Instructional Staff of the 1st Military District (Queensland), nominally with the rank of probationary lieutenant, but he was allowed to retain his Militia rank of captain. He was promoted to captain in the Permanent Military Forces on 1 July 1913. Wynter married Ethel May White, a nurse, on 5 September 1913. They eventually had two sons. First World War Wynter joined the First Australian Imperial Force on 24 April 1916 as a major, having been promoted to the brevet rank on 1 December 1915. He became brigade major of the 11th Infantry Brigade, part of the newly formed 3rd Division. At this time Wynter noticed his eyesight was deteriorating, and he was supplied with glasses. Wynter embarked for the United Kingdom from Sydney with the 11th Infantry Brigade headquarters on the transport HMAT Demosthenes on 18 May 1916, arriving on 20 July 1916. The 3rd Division continued its training on the Salisbury Plain in England but in October 1916 Wynter was sent to the 4th Division in France as its Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DAA&QMG;). On 24 March 1917, he was transferred to I Anzac Corps headquarters as its Deputy Assistant Adjutant General (DAAG). He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 23 July 1917. On 6 July 1918 he was among a small number of Australian officers who accompanied General Sir William Birdwood to Fifth Army headquarters. He rejoined the Australian Corps headquarters on 1 February 1919. For his services as a staff officer, Wynter was mentioned in despatches four times, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. Between the wars Wynter returned to Australia, disembarking in Sydney on 19 February 1920. His AIF appointment was terminated on 18 April 1920 and he reverted to his permanent rank of major. He was entitled to retain his AIF rank as an honorary rank but would not be promoted to the substantive rank until 1 October 1931. Wynter was posted to the 4th Military District (South Australia) but his sojourn in Australia was brief. On 19 November 1920 he re- embarked for the United Kingdom to attend the Staff College, Camberley. The first two post-war classes at the re-opened Staff College were awash with distinguished students. Twenty had been brigadier generals; five had been awarded the Victoria Cross and no less than 170, including Wynter, had been awarded the Distinguished service Order. On returning to Australia in 1923, Wynter was posted to Army Headquarters in Melbourne as a staff officer. In 1925, he became Director of Mobilisation, responsible for the development of war plans. Wynter published a paper on the command of the Imperial forces in wartime in the British Army Quarterly in 1925. He became a notable critic of the Singapore strategy of the government of Prime Minister Stanley Bruce. In September 1926 he delivered a lecture to the United Services Institute of Victoria entitled \\"The Strategical Inter-relationship of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force: and Australian View\\", which was subsequently published in the British Army Quarterly in April 1927. In this article Wynter argued that if war was most likely to break out in the Pacific at a time when the United Kingdom was involved in a crisis in Europe which would prevent it from sending sufficient resources to Singapore and that Singapore was vulnerable, especially to attack from the land and air. Wynter argued for a more balanced policy of building up the Army and Royal Australian Air Force, rather than relying on the Royal Australian Navy, which was receiving the lion's share of defence funding at the time. Wynter attended the Imperial Defence College in 1930. Soon after returning to Australia, Wynter became director of Military Training, with the acting rank of colonel. Following the visit of the British Cabinet Secretary, Sir Maurice Hankey, to Australia in 1934, political interest in the Singapore Strategy debate rose. A copy of Wynter's 1927 paper came into the possession of Senator Charles Brand, who had it copied and circulated amongst the members of the Parliament of Australia. On 5 November 1936, the Leader of the Opposition, John Curtin used the paper to bolster a strong attack on the policies of the Minister for Defence, Archdale Parkhill. Parkhill was further embarrassed by an article in the Daily Telegraph written by Wynter's son Philip, that Parkhill believed contained classified information. In retaliation, in March 1937, Parkhill had Wynter posted to the staff of the 11th Mixed Brigade in Queensland at his substantive rank of lieutenant colonel, with a consequentially reduced salary. At the same time, Parkhill withdrew his recommendation for the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General John Lavarack, another opponent of the Singapore strategy, to be awarded a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Parkhill lost his seat in the 1937 election and Lavarack recalled Wynter, who had been promoted to colonel on 1 July 1937, to command the new Army Command and Staff College, which opened at Victoria Barracks, Sydney on 1 July 1938. This was an important initiative for Lavarack, who was concerned that, just as politicians were uncritically following the Singapore strategy, too many military officers were uncritically adopting British ideas. Lavarack hoped to \\"develop and teach a system which, while taking note generally of the British Army system, will also be suitable to our special conditions.\\" Wynter was promoted to brigadier on 28 August 1939. Second World War Major General H. D. Wynter with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Lord Cranborne In October 1939, Wynter was promoted to major general and assumed command of Northern Command. In April 1940, I Corps was formed and Wynter accepted an offer from Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey to become its Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster General, its senior administrative officer, \\"a post somewhat smaller than his exceptional experience and talents deserved but the highest the overseas force could offer in the field\\". Acceptance also involved a drop in rank back to brigadier. Wynter joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 22 April 1940, and was given the AIF serial number QX6150. Wynter embarked from Melbourne on 15 May 1940 with the advance party of I Corps with orders to establish a base organisation in the Middle East but the convoy he was travelling with was diverted to the United Kingdom. Up until a couple of days before it arrived, the convoy had been under the command of Brigadier Leslie Morshead of the 18th Infantry Brigade but on 18 April, Wynter discovered that the Military Board back in Australia had promoted him to major general and appointed him to command the AIF in the United Kingdom. Wynter decided that, given the immediate danger of a German invasion of the United Kingdom, his force had to be ready to fight. He therefore reorganised the troops available to form a second infantry brigade. The 18th Infantry Brigade became the Southern Command Striking Force, with a key role in the defence of southern England. However, the anticipated invasion did not eventuate. In September Wynter was informed that his force would become the nucleus of a new 9th Division and on 23 October 1940 he was appointed to command it. Wynter and 18th Infantry Brigade departed the United Kingdom for the Middle East in November 1940. In January 1941, the medical authorities deemed him medically unfit for further duty and ordered his return to Australia for treatment. He arrived back in Sydney on 12 April 1941 and his AIF appointment was terminated on 6 July 1941. For his service in the United Kingdom, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1942. Wynter assumed command of Eastern Command on 12 December 1941. In Blamey's reorganisation of the Army in April 1942, Wynter was appointed Lieutenant General Administration (LGA) at Allied Land Headquarters in Melbourne. As such he was in charge of all of the Army's logistical activities. His principal subordinates were the Adjutant General, Major General Victor Stantke; the Quartermaster General, Major General James Cannan; and the Master General of the Ordnance, Major General Leslie Beavis. Suffering from high blood pressure, Wynter relinquished his post of LGA on 19 September 1944. The next day he was placed on the Supernumerary List pending retirement. He was admitted to the 115th General Hospital in Heidelberg, Victoria where he died on 7 February 1945. The medical officer listed the cause of death as uremia and hypertension. He was buried with military honours in Springvale cemetery.

Written by Larry Niven and directed by Dennis Steinmetz, it first aired in the United States on September 28, 1974 on NBC. The episode guest stars Walker Edmiston. Plot The Marshalls build a raft and head downstream in search of civilization, with the hope of finding a way back to Earth. The raft comes to a waterfall where they are forced to quickly leap into a cave. Inside they meet a crazed man who identifies himself as Jefferson Davis Collie III (Walker Edmiston), a Confederate artilleryman. Collie forces them to mine the glowing minerals of his cavern to earn a meal. Rick hypothesizes that the lode may be a radioactive power source which causes the opening of time portals. Collie explains the peculiar properties of the minerals (such as that a red and a green crystal together make a bright light, and an added yellow crystal creates a blinding but short-lived light) and tells of his experience shooting and eating three Sleestak. He explains that the river travels underground, but refuses to tell the Marshalls if and where the river comes up again, explaining that he is starved for company and wants them to stay. Three Sleestak appear with crossbows, but Collie scares them off with rounds from his cannon, \\"Sarah.\\" Out of water, Collie heads to refill, and the Marshalls sneak after him. The four are ambushed by Sleestak, and Rick puts a red, green, and yellow crystal together, creating a blinding flash that dazes the monsters. The light quickly dies, however. Will grabs a blue crystal and a green crystal, which together make a bomb which explodes around the Sleestak. The Marshalls and Collie escape into the river, and head downstream. Eventually they find themselves in a swamp, and recognizing the Pylon, realize the river runs in a circle and has led back to their own part of the jungle. Rick supposes the jungle is impossible to leave without a time portal, calling it a \\"closed universe.\\" Collie, frightened by the dinosaurs, decides to return to his cave. Creation and reception During the filming of a scene where Walker Edmiston fired the cannon, the charge was so strong an actor playing a Sleestak was knocked over. In 2009, the online review site Premium Hollywood described the episode as \\"lackluster\\", but added that it \\"begins to offer us a peek into how complex this series could become.\\" Plot Holes Collie questions the Marshalls about whether they are \\"Union\\" or \\"Confederate\\". When they state they are from California he tells them California is not state. In fact California was admitted to the union in 1850, eleven years before the civil war.

They would be replaced by the Chevrolet Series F in 1917.  Beginning  1914 Chevrolet H-4 Baby Grand The Baby Grand was one of the first automobiles made by Chevrolet under W.C. Durant, GM's founder. It was part of his idea to build a car to compete with the very popular and cheap Model T Ford. When it first came out, it was priced at $875 as a four-door, 5-passenger touring car (a 1914 Model T touring was $500). A speedometer was standard. One advantage over a Model T Ford was that a Baby Grand could get an electric starter (the Model T did not get them until 1919). Models In 1914 the Series H debuted with the H-2 Royal Mail Roadster and the H-4 5-seater Baby Grand Touring model, both with a wheelbase. In 1915, all Series H models got a longer wheelbase and larger brakes, and an electric starter was now standard. Also for 1915 Chevrolet introduced the Amesbury Special model H-3, a 3-seat roadster (similar to the Royal Mail) that sold for $985. It came painted in French grey with green patent leather interior. The standard wheels were the plain wooden spoke type, but most of the cars sold had the optional Houk wire wheels which cost $125 extra and were painted green to match the interior. Sadly due to poor sales this model was dropped after only one year.

Family Erasmo de Sequeria was the son of Dr. Jack de Sequeira and Lilia Margarida de Gouveia Pinto. His father was the founder of the United Goans Party and also the first Leader of Opposition in the Goa assembly. He is popularly known as the Father of the Opinion Poll in Goa. Sequeira married Maureen and they had three children Dr Amita de Sequeira, Dr Anil de Sequeira and Aisha de Sequeira. Role in the Goa Opinion Poll The United Goans Party was the main proponent of a referendum on the issue of merger of Goa with Maharashtra. During the Goa Opinion Poll, Jack and Erasmo were the leaders of the anti-merger faction. Sequeira pasted posters in the dead of the night. He conducted meetings with other activists to plan strategies. He did the legwork that his father required of him. Political career Erasmo de Sequeira was the leader of the United Goans Party (Sequeira Group); which was founded by his father. He represented Marmagoa parliamentary constituency twice between 1967-1977. He was also a member of the Parliamentary Estimates Committee between 1968-69. During his term as a Member of Parliament, he advocated greater links with Latin America. He was made the leader of Parliamentary delegations to foreign countries many times; especially when the delegations were sent to Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries. Although Erasmo was a member of the Opposition, he was known to be on good terms with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. During the Emergency, a large number of Opposition leaders were arrested. Erasmo de Sequeria was a notable exception. He became the Opposition's voice in the Parliament. On one occasion, Indira Gandhi invited Sequeira to join the Congress. She assured him that he would be made a Deputy Minister. When he refused, she offered to make him a Minister of State. He refused again, saying that he aimed higher. Indira told him that she could not make him a Cabinet Minister due to his lack of experience. Sequeira replied that he did not want that either. When Indira finally asked Sequeira what he wanted he replied, \\"Your chair, madam, your chair!\\". =Second split in UGP= In 1977, Sequeira joined hands with the Bharatiya Lok Dal, headed by Charan Singh. He did this without consulting his party members. The party members were enraged, causing the UGP (Sequiera group) to split into two groups: UGP (Sequeria Group) and UGP (Naik Group). He lost the next parliamentary election to Eduardo Faleiro of UGP-N in March 1977. In the next Assembly elections, UGP-S managed to win just three seats as compared to UGP-N, which won 10 seats.

The original foundations of a church, a granite platform, can be clearly seen. Actually, S. Pedro de la Mata is a kind of semi-cave construction. Some fragments of walls and a couple of arches can also be seen. The church appears to have gone through various phases, and dating of its features is problematic. According to traditional historiography, it was originally the church of a monastery, one of those that grew, promoted by the nobility, around the capital city of the Visigothic Kingdom of Toledo, similar to the case of Santa Mar√≠a de Melque not far from S. Pedro de la Mata. This origin would allow us to date the first church between 589 (conversion of Visigothic nobility to Catholicism) and 711 (takeover of the Visigothic kingdom by Muslim invasion). Conservation The site was given protection in the 1931 under Spanish legislation. It is listed as Ermita de San Pedro de la Mata. Its state has recently given cause for concern, according to the Spanish heritage organisation Hispania Nostra. San Pedro de la Mata is being considered for World Heritage Site status along with nine other Mozarabic sites. The submission was made in 2019 by the Spanish Ministry of Culture and Sport and it was included on a \\"tentative list\\" (part of the nominating process). Access The place can be reached by a dirt road starting west of the church of Casalgordo. Museum collections In the nearby village (pedan√≠a) of Arisgotas, municipality of Orgaz, there is a small Visigothic museum. The museum includes material from San Pedro and a Visigothic archaeological site 3 km away called Los Hitos. It features carved stones that were looted by the local inhabitants for use as construction materials. In recent years, many of these Visigothic stones have been extracted from the walls of the village houses and deposited in the collection.

The Maepsy was a badge engineered version of the Opel Kadett C, or to be more precise, of the PF50 Isuzu Gemini. Originally the car was sold as the Saehan Gemini (Saehan Bird in export markets), but in February 1982 the car evolved to become the Saehan Maepsy. By 1983 it was called the Daewoo Maepsy after Saehan Motor was bought out by the Daewoo Group, and finally the Daewoo Maepsy-Na (New Maepsy, ÎßµÏãúÎÇò). The word \\"maepsy\\" means \\"beautiful\\" in Korean. The original Gemini was equipped with a 1492 cc imported four-cylinder engine. Power was at 5,400 rpm, for a claimed top speed of . This imported engine made the car rather expensive, however, and when the Hyundai Pony was introduced Saehan's market share dropped precipitously. A measure of popularity was retained as the Gemini was the only compact car in South Korea with an available automatic transmission. In 1981, in an attempt at consolidating the South Korean transportation industry which had been hard hit by the 1980 recession, the new military dictatorship of Chun Doo-hwan forced Kia to give up production of its Brisa and focus entirely on light trucks. In return, Saehan and Hyundai had to give up this segment of the market, while a planned merger of the two did not come to fruition. Not only did these changes allow Saehan a bigger share of the market, but they were also able to use the domestically built 1.3-liter (Mazda TC) engine that Kia no longer had any use for, which lowered the price of the new Maepsy considerably. The facelifted Saehan Maepsy was introduced in February 1982, with the 1.3-liter engine using LPG and producing (SAE) for a top speed of . The 1.5-liter model claimed (SAE) but somehow had a slightly lower top speed of ( for the automatic). In 1983, the name was changed to Daewoo Maepsy. In September 1983, for the 1984 model year, the car received another facelift, with bigger rectangular headlamps, becoming the Maepsy-Na in the process. The rear was also changed, echoing the design of the 1979 Isuzu Gemini. The XQ engine was built by Daewoo from April 1984 and installed in the Maepsy beginning in September, meaning that Kia's 1.3-liter version was retired. Claimed power for the earlier 1.5 was now only as South Korea had switched to using DIN ratings, but when the XQ arrived Daewoo once again used SAE gross and claimed . Between 1982 and 1989, 400,000 Maepsys and Maepsy-Nas were built. Production of the regular sedan ended in July 1986 when the Racer/LeMans was introduced although a version intended for taxi usage continued to be produced until 1989 as the \\"Daewoo Maepsy Sigma.\\"  Saehan/Daewoo Max  A pickup truck version was also offered initially as the Saehan Max and later as the Daewoo Max from August 1979 to 1988. These have the 1.5-liter four, although Opel's 2-liter diesel engine became available in May 1980. These were exported to Greece as the \\"Saehan Max 850\\" (reflecting the max load capacity), but in 1980 the importer went bankrupt in part due to new, more stringent European rules being introduced in Greece. 220 leftover trucks (cabins without beds) were left in a customs area in Athens. After a number of years they were bought by a Norwegian entrepreneur and sold in Norway at rock bottom prices, in spite of much resistance from other local importers. In December 1981 a three-way bed was introduced, and in January 1983 the name was changed to Daewoo Max. The Max used the original Gemini front even as the Maepsy's new bodywork was introduced in 1982, but the 1984 facelift was applied to the Max as well. Beginning in November 1984 the 1.5-liter XQ engine was installed in the Max as well. The Max ended production in 1988 without a successor.

The print is in limited edition. With his growing reputation, Boutet launched his own publishing house and sold his productions to periodicals such as Le Frou-frou, L'Assiette au beurre, Le P√™le-M√™le, or artistic publications such as La Plume, L'Estampe originale, The modern print or even the Hundred Collection. It illustrates many almanacs (The Female Year), calendars, menus. In 1902 he published \\"Les Modes Feminines du XIXe Siecle\\" which met with instant acclaim. His 100 drypoint etchings showed the development of fashion for each year from 1801 to 1900 - drypoint etching results in an image with intrinsic softness of texture. The illustrations were hand-coloured, with close attention to detail, and a treatment that showed his affection for the subject matter.

It stars Spencer Leigh, Bruce Payne and Richard Borthwick. Plot The film is a thriller about computer fraud. Leon, a computer hacker, and Freak, a programmer, team up with Fast Eddie, a video games expert, to get revenge on Lawrence McNeice (\\"a hired hand for\\" several corporations), who framed Leon for a computer fraud he didn't commit. Lawrence McNiece is the head of computer security in a large corporation. Leon is a computer hacker, imprisoned for a fraud. The story implies that McNiece was involved in some way, although it is not made clear exactly why Leon wants revenge on him. When Leon was sentenced to prison the shock caused his dad to have a heart attack. Leon looks for revenge for his father's death and whatever events transpired to put Leon away in the first place. Leon hangs around in an arcade and meets an intimidating bald headed man who bullies him into wagering money. The man introduces a beautiful young woman, Edith who goes by the name Fast Eddie. Leon wagers his last ¬£5 and plays the Atari Videogame TX-1, a three screen racing game of the era. Leon plays as well as he can, but Eddie is extremely good at TX-1 and thrashes him. He loses his money. Leon returns to the arcade the following night and meets up wuth Eddie. He tells her that she is \\"the fastest I've ever seen\\" and recruits her into his gang. The intimidating man is stabbed in the arcade for reasons that are not made clear, so Leon and Eddie run away. Eddie (real name Edith) introduces Leon to a boy known as Freak. Freak is a hacker, and joins the gang. Between Leon's hacker knowledge, Freak's hacker skillset and Eddie's incredible typing speed, the gang is complete and Leon introduces them to his plan. They are going to steal money from the C.H.A.P.S computer system, the security of which is the responsibility of McNeice. Leon explains that every financial transaction performed by C.H.A.P.S results in cash amounts that are rounded down to the nearest whole penny, and he wants Freak to write a program that they can upload to McNeice's computer to put those fractions of pennies into their own bank account.No-one will notice the missing money as the fractions of pennies are usually rounded down, so the financial institutions will not see anything is missing. But first, they will need to find a way to get access to McNiece's computer system. With Eddie playing the part of a magazine interviewer, she meets McNeice and tries to obtain information about C.H.A.P.S. Meanwhile, Freak is thrown out of his house by his parents who disapprove of his activities and sell all his computer equipment. Freak needs this equipment to work, so he takes a job at a security software expo. He is paid to show his computer hacking skills to the attendees in order that they purchase security software. In reality, Freak is using the system to access C.H.A.P.S. Eddie's relationship with Leon becomes closer, but Leon feels jealous as Eddie's pretend relationship with McNiece also becomes closer. In a twist, Eddie learns that McNiece knows about the gang, and he whispers to her that he is \\"just like them... I'm just a lot better at it.\\" Eddie and McNiece make love, and Freak manages to install his software onto McNeice's computer, whilst McNiece is distracted by having his nob out. Freak manages to sneak his malicious code into a \\"fisheries game\\" while McNiece and Eddie are at it like rabbits.. The game's payload should be triggered if someone plays the game, and Freak and Leon are nervous, hoping this will work. Eddie arrives home, after her night of romance, but Leon is visibly upset by this turn of events. Eddie explains that she had no choice but to distract McNiece with sex, but does not make Leon aware that McNeice knows what they are up to. The important thing for Leon and Eddie is that the software did upload, and all they have do do is home that someone triggers it. The evening of romance and computer talk alters the dynamic of all concerned. Leon is now jealous of McNiece and Eddie's relationship. Eddie knows that McNeice is aware of the gang, and he could presumably stop them at any time, yet he has not done so. The next day, an employee of McNiece's company triggers the software payload by playing the fisheries game. McNeice is angry that someone has access to the computer system, and loudly plays the role of the security expert fighting to lock his computers down from the intrusion. Meanwhile, Freak at the expo is hacking into the system and the battle between Freak and McNiece plays out with Freak the winner. Massive sums of money now lie in the gang's account, with McNeice screaming that he is locked out of his own system. McNiece's furious and overly demonstrative attempts to stop the hacker are at odds with his quiet apologies to his bosses, as he explains he will get the money back. McNiece is saying all the right things, but does not seem to be trustworthy because we know he is in a relationship with Eddie and her gang just stole the money. Did McNiece really try and prevent the theft when he was shouting so loudly, or did he let them get away with it? Freak, Eddie and Leon are rich on their stolen earnings, and the money is split into briefcases. As the gang are about to go their separate ways with their money, McNeice arrives at the flat. Eddie seems to have been expecting this visit, and she explains that she is working with McNeice and has decided that they should give the money back. It seems obvious to Leon that Eddie and McNiece are together as a couple and McNiece is just stealing the money. Eddie and McNeice leave with the briefcase of cash handcuffed to McNeice's wrist. They leave, get into McNeice's Ferrari and Eddie drives. They discuss that they are heading for the airport and laugh as they appear to have got away with the crime, leaving Leon and Freak to take the blame. Leon decides to chase after them and in his hurry to leave he doesn't hear Freak shouting out of the window that this is all a set-up. The briefcase of money that is handcuffed to McNeice is just one-third of the cash and Eddie has a plan. Leon steals a car, and chases Eddie, although his choice of vehicle leave a lot to be desired. Leon has no chance of catching up with a Ferrari. Eddie misses the turn off for the airport, and McNiece asks what is going on. Eddie explains that they are going to the police but she will not be there when he has to explain why he has hundreds of thousands of pounds of stolen money handcuffed to his wrist. She drives faster and faster and the film is inter-cut with images from the Atari TX-1 game she played earlier. The car is crashed, McNeice is trapped, and the police arrive to find Eddie (and the remaining briefcases of cash) are nowhere to be seen. Leon catches up with the accident, and is surprised to meet Eddie, who still has the remaining huge sums of money. As they leave, safe and unknown to the police, they discuss what their next caper will be. Cast *Richard Borthwick as Mr. Kyle *Sean Edwards as Freak *Spencer Leigh as Leon *Bruce Payne as Lawrence McNiece *Alexandra Pigg as Fast Eddie Reception Although the film received mixed to negative reviews, it is notable for its highly accurate computer hacking scenes, using authentic software instead of mock-up graphics. The film was released on VHS in America, and at least one of the actors had their dialogue replaced as it was felt that American Audiences would not be able to understand the English regional dialects. Dialogue was also changed to remove British slang and some strong language was removed. For example, Freak asks where the 'johns' are but you can clearly see his mouth says 'loo', which is a British slang term for toilet. Freak tells Eddie to distract McNiece, \\"even if it means having sex with the bastard\\" which is changed to \\"slimeball\\" on the US VHS. Most of Leon's dialogue appears to have been re-voiced and he appears considerably softer spoken in the US version. The original BBC TV version has never seen a commercial release in the UK, and has almost zero presence online, suggesting that the world has largely forgotten it ever happened. there are no reviews, or clips to be found.

Located in the Dorsoduro sestiere (quarter), it was called \\"dell'ambasciatore\\" because it was the home of the ambassadors of the Austrian Empire to the Republic. History One Loredan ancestor, Antonio, was the administrator of Corfu who defeated the Turks in 1716, together with Count Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, a Saxon general. After the battle, Count Schulenburg set up house inside the Loredan Palace, along with 25 members of his entourage and four gondoliers, and was known for his illustrious dinner parties and admirable art collection. In 1752, another ancestor, Francesco Loredan, who later was Doge, offered the palazzo as a residence for the Ambassador of the Holy Roman Empire in exchange for 29 years of restorations. The first Imperial Ambassador to live there was Count Philip Joseph Orsini-Rosenberg who, after his arrival in Venice, married Giustiniana Wynne, a close friend of Giacomo Casanova. The couple resided together in Palazzo Loredan dell'Ambasciatore during the first years of their marriage. These days, the Palazzo dell'Ambasciatore is owned by the Gaggia family.

Co-consecrators were the Apostolic nuncio in Thailand, Archbishop Salvatore Pennacchio, and Joseph Sangval Surasarang, former Bishop of Chiang Mai.Agenzia Fides February 12, 2009 Coat of arms Coat of Arms (Bishop of Chiang Mai) The bishopric coat of arms is subdivided into four fields. The blue (azure) symbolizes the separation from the worldly values and the ascent of the soul toward God, therefore the run of the spiritual Virtues which raise themselves from the things of the earth toward the incorruptibility of the sky. On this background we see the flame radiant, symbol of the light which comes from God, from His Word here represented by the book of the Holy Scripture. The concept of the light wants also to recall the \\"Lux Mundi\\" seminary where Msgr. Vira Arpondratna served as a teacher. The flame and the book are in gold (or) the metal most noble, the symbol of the first virtue, the Faith; indeed is by the Faith that we can totally understand the strength of the guiding light which comes from God and from His Word. The letters Alpha and Omega are in red, the colour of love, the love of the Father for us. The silver (argent) is the symbol of the transparency, then of the Truth and Justice, fundamental dowries of the pastoral solicitude of the Bishop. The star symbolizes Our Celestial Mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary; the chequy fess comes from the coat of arms of St.Xavier family, to remind the name of the Bishop while the green mountains, in heraldic shape, want to underline the nature of the diocese of Chiang Mai.Coat of arms description at Diocese website (Thai) Motto \\"OMNIA FACIO PROPTER EVANGELIUM\\" (1 Cor 9,23) For his motto, Bishop Vira, has chosen the words from the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians of St Paul to mean that his pastoral plan is founded on the total adhesion to the message of love and salvation of the Gospel.

It replaced the Mod√®le 1951 helmet. It was the standard helmet for both the Army and the Mobile Gendarmerie. In 1992 the SPECTRA helmet started to supersede the Mod√®le 1978. The SPECTRA helmet is made of Spectra fiber, which makes the Mod√®le 1978 the last French helmet made of steel.  Design and production  The Mod√®le 1978 is a one-piece helmet made 1.2mm of amagnetic steel, weighting 1.2kg. They were usually painted in NATO olive paint with IR- isolating properties to reduce the thermal signature of the wearer. It was made by the Dunois company in Cousance, and by GIAT in Rennes. By 1983, some 300,000 helmets were in service, for a total of 700,000 planned.  History  Research on the Mod√®le 1978 helmet started around 1973. In contrast to the Mod√®le 1951 helmet, the new model was a one-piece heavy helmet, rather than consisting of a light liner underneath a stronger metal helmet. Prototypes went for testing in the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment, the 75th Infantry Regiment and the 13th Bataillon de Chasseurs Alpins. On 5 June 1978, the French Army adopted prototypes helmet A4 and chin strap A5 as the Mod√®le 1978 helmet. Usage by paratroopers, in particular, yielded improvements to the chin strap to avoid accidents. The modified variant entered service in 1982 as the F1 s√©rie 2 helmet.

These technologies can also be used for indoor tracking of persons wearing a tag. RFID 'Passive' RFID tags broadcast their location but have limited transmission range (typically a few meters). Longer-range \\"smart tags\\" use 'active' RFID -where a radio transmitter is powered by a battery and can transmit up to 2000 meters (6,600 feet) in optimum conditions. RFID-based Asset Tracking requires an infrastructure to be put in place before the whereabouts of tags may be ascertained. An asset tracking system can record the location and usage of the assets and generate various reports. Barcodes Assets can be tracked via manually scanning barcodes such as QR codes. QR codes can be scanned using smartphones with cameras and dedicated apps, as well as with barcode readers. NFC Latest trend in asset tracking is using NFC. NFC technology simplifies tracking of assets by tapping the assets and getting the details. This is an advantage for tracking critical assets where user needs to see the condition of the asset to be tracked. GPS asset tracking Assets may also be tracked globally using devices which combine the GPS system and mobile phone and/or satellite phone technology. Such devices are known as GPS asset trackers and are different from other GPS tracking units in that they rely on an internal battery for power rather than being hard-wired to a vehicle's battery. The frequency with which the position of the device must be known or available dictates the quality, size or type of GPS asset tracker required. It is common for asset tracking devices to fail due to Faraday cage effects as a huge proportion of the worlds assets are moved via intermodal containers. However modern tracking technology has now seen advances in signal transmission that allows enough signal strength reception from the GPS satellite system which can then be reported via GPRS to terrestrial networks. Mobile phones are personal devices. Asset tracking apps for smart devices had been used as a means of personal tracking and rescues. For example, Find My iPhone is an app and service provided by Apple; it was used in rescuing a missing person in deep ravine from a car accident after other attempts failed. There are also tracking apps combined with viewing functions used as a surveillance similar to FAA's Automatic dependent surveillance ‚Äì broadcast (ADS-B). Wi-fi, IR, and Bluetooth For indoor asset tracking Wi-fi combined with another technology like IR has been used. Bluetooth technology has also been used, and may provide more accuracy even if Bluetooth technology wasn't primarily developed for localisation. In order to position an asset via Bluetooth, which is a basic requirement for asset tracking, the RSSI is used to calculate a distance to the signaling transmitter from the signal strength. The principles for position determination are trilateration, triangulation and fingerprinting.

A master of communication, his pitching skills are legendary, and he never loses an account. Eddie is engaged to Judy Birk (Stefanie von Pfetten), the boss's daughter. Eddie's life looks perfect, but internally he battles an addiction to sex with no success. His addiction has led him into a life of lies and deceit. Although struggling with his dark side, Eddie thinks his infidelities are victimless crimes and justifies them with his business success. After winning a huge pitch for the agency, Eddie discovers his co-worker and friend Angelina (Lauren Lee Smith) has been raped by Judy's brother Anthony (Sebastien Roberts). The Birk family bring in their top lawyer to make sure Anthony is found innocent ‚Äì but to ensure his freedom Anthony blackmails Eddie with evidence of Eddie's countless affairs, demanding Eddie testifies in court on his behalf. To maintain his perfect life and upcoming marriage ‚Äì Eddie helps Anthony get off the hook. When Anthony is found not guilty, his victim Angelina is devastated and tries to commit suicide. At the last moment an army general (Michael Clarke Duncan) saves her life. Only Angelina sees The General who is a powerful, revenging, guiding angel of heaven and hell. An ethereal force. Judy finds out about Eddie's affairs and breaks off the engagement and her father (Art Hindle) fires him. Eddie is cut out of the world he created for himself. Helped by her new guardian angel, The General, Angelina takes brutal revenge on both Anthony and Eddie. She gives every bit as good as she was given to Anthony. First, she physically punishes him with a beating, then she uses handcuffs to restrain him while she performs anal sex on him with a device. Knowing she would never be safe from him after her revenge, she shoots and kills him. She orchestrates the assault so that Eddie is the main suspect, thus getting her revenge on him for his failure to testify against Anthony. With no support from former family and friends, Eddie finds himself in prison, facing trial with no way out.

Rick tries to tell the Pakuni to create a diversion while he lowers a rope to rescue the three. The Pakuni do not understand, but come to the same conclusion on their own, and lure Grumpy away while Alice is stuck on the opposite side of the crevasse. Rick pulls everyone out of the crevasse just as Grumpy returns, continuing to roar at Alice. The Marshalls and the Pakuni arrive to safety, and Rick teaches the Pakuni how to harvest vegetables to prevent them from stealing again. Reception The online review site Premium Hollywood described the episode in 2009 as a \\"straight-up dino tale\\" that follows the \\"lackluster\\" suit of the first five episodes.

It served the locality between 1874 and 1964. History A 1903 Railway Clearing House map showing (left) railways in the vicinity of Partington The line between Skelton West Junction and Cressington Junction was opened for goods traffic on 1 March 1873, with passenger trains beginning on 1 August 1873. The first station named Partington was opened on that line in May 1874. The construction of the Manchester Ship Canal, which was to cross the line between Partington and , meant that the railway had to be raised by in order to give a clearance for shipping. A new line, parallel to the old but slightly to the south-west, was built on embankments formed using the soil excavated from the new canal; it included the new Cadishead Viaduct. The new line was brought into use for goods traffic on 27 February 1893; a new Partington station was built on that line, and passenger traffic was transferred from the old line to the new on 29 May 1893, in plenty of time for the opening of the Ship Canal on 1 January 1894. The new station was from London St Pancras, and from Liverpool Central. The second station was closed on 30 November 1964.

Early life and First World War Williams was born the son of a blacksmith in Rissington, north of Napier, New Zealand. While a shepherd working on a farm in Hawke‚Äôs Bay, he inflated his age by three years in order to enlist in the New Zealand Army in March 1916. By 1917, he was on the front lines in Belgium working as a runner with the 3rd Battalion New Zealand Rifle Brigade at Messines, before being severely wounded in the Battle of Passchendaele on 12 October 1917. As he and an officer tried to move forward in front of a German machine gun post at Wolf Farm, both were peppered by bullets. The officer was killed, while Williams remained out overnight in a muddy shell hole with three bullet wounds, one of which had shattered his thigh.T. Potter, ‚ÄòFinal battle of our last WW1 soldier‚Äô, Sunday Star Times, 23 February 2003, p.C10. During the Battle 845 New Zealand soldiers of the New Zealand Division were killed in action, with over 2,700 being wounded. In total for that battle, the allied forces suffered 508,800 casualties, while Germany suffered 348,300 casualties. During a 2001 interview, Williams spoke of suffering through mud and freezing rain, and sheltering in trenches among the corpses of dead German soldiers.*Bright Williams - Last Man Standing Execam Video No longer fit for service, Williams returned to farming in Hawke‚Äôs Bay where he continued to be troubled by his wounds. Later life To mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the War in 1998, French President Jacques Chirac granted approval for the award of the L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur to an estimated 1200 surviving foreign soldiers who had fought alongside the French on the Western Front. This commemoration started with a visit to New Zealand by the French Minister for War Veterans, Jean Pierre Masseret in April 1998, to enlist help from the Government in locating surviving Great War veterans in New Zealand. Only nine survivors were located and eight were still alive when presentations were made around the country by French Ambassador Jaques Le Blanc in October and November 1998. Most of the recipients were over 100 years old and gratefully accepted the awards in recognition of their lost mates and the high price paid by the New Zealand Army in the First World War. Williams received his Croix de Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur from the French Ambassador at the Napier RSA in 1998, and wore \\"it on parade to honour men who did not come back from France, who were buried there in known and unknown graves\\". Williams died on 13 February 2003 at the age of 105. At the time of his death, Williams had two daughters, eleven grandchildren, twenty great-grandchildren, and two great-great- grandchildren.Brewer, Mark E., New Zealand and the Legion of Honour: The Great War, The Volunteers: Journal of the New Zealand Military Historical Society, 2012.

Early life Martyn was a merchant of Galway and a member of the Martyn family, one of the Tribes of Galway. He was the son of former Mayor of Galway, Wylliam Martin. West Bridge and Mills In 1558 he obtained a grant from Queen Mary to build a mill on the west side of the Corrib river, on condition that he build a new stone bridge defended with gates and battlements. This map of 1651 shows the walled city (North is to the left). The River Corrib is in the foreground, crossed by what is now O‚ÄôBriens Bridge, leading to Mainguard Street. It was completed in 1562 and bore a plaque declaring that Thomas √ìge and his wife Evelina Lynch \\"caused this bridge and mill to be made\\". The bridge and mills was demolished c. 1800 and rebuilt as the Bridge Mills by the Murphy family. The rebuilt bridge is now called O'Brien's Bridge. Later life and descendants Thomas √ìge served as bailiff of Galway from September 1533 to September 1534, and served twice as Mayor of Galway for the terms 1549-1550, and 1562-1563\\\\. He served as a master of Galway from 1550 to 1577, after which he disappears from the town records. He was the father of William √ìge Martyn and Francis Martin, both of whom were later Mayors of Galway. Via William √ìge, Thomas √ìge is believed to be an ancestor of Richard \\"Humanity Dick\\" Martin (1754-1834), Harriet Letitia Martin (1801‚Äì91) Mary Letitia Martin (1815‚Äì50) and D'Arcy Argue Counsell Martin (1899-1992).

Description The Mod√®le 1951 comprised a heavy external cover, made of 1.2 mm of an amagnetic alloy of manganese steel, and a lighter inner helmet. The Mod√®le 1951 was produced until 1976, before being superseded by the Mod√®le 1978 helmet. It nonetheless remained in service well into the 1980s.

It entered the Billboard 200 on February 17, 1968 and remained on the charts for 23 weeks, peaking at #93. US charts at PetulaClark.net It fared better in the United Kingdom, where it reached #37. UK charts at PetulaClark.net After collaborating with producer/songwriter Tony Hatch on nine US Top 40 hits, Petula Clark had begun to work independently of Hatch in 1966 collaborating with Sonny Burke on \\"This is My Song\\" which would become Clark's most successful global hit in the spring of 1967: Burke also oversaw the resultant These Are My Songs album although that album did feature one Clark/Hatch collaboration: \\"Don't Sleep in the Subway\\" which would provide Clark with a further Top Ten hit. Clark's next single: \\"The Cat in the Window (The Bird in the Sky)\\" was produced by Charles Koppelman and Don Rubin, and was released in August 1967 as the first advance single for what would become Clark's The Other Man's Grass is Always Greener album, although as \\"The Cat in the Window...\\" shaped up to become Clark's first US Top Twenty shortfall since she'd reached #1 with \\"Downtown\\" in 1965 plans for Clark to record an entire album with Koppelman/Rubin were scrapped and in September 1967 Clark reunited with the producer Sonny Burke, and also \\"This is My Song\\" arranger Ernie Freeman, to record the nucleus of her next album release at Western Studios (Los Angeles) with the Wrecking Crew session players. The tracks which Sonny Burke had Clark record included his own composition: \\"Black Coffee\\", which had helmed the iconic 1953 debut album by Peggy Lee: Black Coffee, which Petula Clark would eventually describe as \\"my Bible. I knew every note [Peggy Lee] sang, every note of the orchestrations.\\" Clark would add that she herself \\"really shouldn't have touched\\" the song \\"Black Coffee\\". Burke also had Clark record \\"Smile\\", the signature composition by Charlie Chaplin, writer of \\"This is My Song\\" - ; the current Engelbert Humperdinck hit \\"The Last Waltz\\"; the 1953 Frankie Laine hit \\"Answer Me, My Love\\"; and the Lerner & Loewe showtune \\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\". Burke also produced the only French language track to be included on a non-Francophone album by Petula Clark: \\"L'√Æle de France\\", which Clark herself wrote with lyricist Pierre Delano√´. With Burke's output seemingly too easy listening focused to yield the comeback single Clark required it was felt expedient to reunite the singer with Tony Hatch to produce a second advance single \\"The Other Man's Grass is Always Greener\\", as song written by Hatch with Jackie Trent which would eventually serve as the title cut for Clark's January 1968 album release. \\"The Other Man's Grass is Greener\\" would in fact become Clark's second consecutive US Top 30 shortfall peaking at #31 on the Hot 100 in Billboard for the last week of December 1967 and the first week of January 1968. The single fared better in the UK - where its title was formatted as \\"The Other Man's Grass (is Always Greener)\\" - spending six weeks in the Top 30 with a #20 peak on the UK chart dated January 16 1968.

The band was formed in Columbia, Missouri in 2006, and has released six full-length albums. Cave has toured widely in North America and Europe, and played the Pitchfork Music Festival in 2010. History Cave was formed in 2006 as an informal collaborative project by Columbia, Missouri friends Cooper Crain, Dan Browning, and Rex McMurry, with Chicago native Rotten Milk. At the time, Crain and McMurry were also members of the now-defunct Missouri band Warhammer 48K. When Warhammer disbanded in 2008 the four began seriously writing and recording music together. Milk, 49, got his name while Cave was playing a show in Chicago and he spilled milk on stage. The story goes that Cave rocked the house for so long that by the time they went to clean up the milk, it had already spoiled. As described by Dusted Magazine, \\"Cave is primarily an instrumental band, but its members use their voices as an additional rhythmic element.\\" Often referred to as psychedelic drone or \\"psych collective,\\" the band's style is also heavily influenced by Krautrock. Cave are considered part of the \\"Columbia Diaspora\\", a group of bands with members from Columbia, Missouri who now reside in Chicago, including Mahjongg and Lazer Crystal. In 2008 Cave released their first full- length album Hunt Like Devil/Jamz on Permanent Records. The following year they released an album on Important Records, Psychic Psummer, which received a positive review from Pitchfork Media and was described as \\"near-perfect\\" by AV Club. In 2010 they released an EP on Drag City Records, Pure Moods, which was reviewed favorably by Pop Matters and garnered mixed reviews from Tiny Mix Tapes and Pitchfork. Cave's Pure Moods EP was followed in 2011 by their third full-length album, Neverendless, which was also very well-received, with Pitchfork stating that the album introduced a new \\"feeling of focus and structure in [Cave's] music.\\" Shortly before the album's release, the band played a show from the back of a flatbed truck while driving through Chicago, garnering a glowing feature in the Chicago Reader. Video of Chicago flatbed truck show can be seen online. Guitarist/organist Cooper Crain has also released material from his solo project Bitchin' Bajas on Permanent Records, and works with other Chicago bands as an analog recording engineer.

Overview  They result from partial hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholines, which removes one of the fatty acid groups. The hydrolysis is generally the result of the enzymatic action of phospholipase A2.Phosphatidylcholine and related lipids , lipidlibrary.co.uk Among other properties, they activate endothelial cells during early atherosclerosis and stimulate phagocyte recruitment when released by apoptotic cells. Moreover, LPCs can be used in the lab to cause demyelination of brain slices, to mimic the effects of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Further, they are known to stimulate phagocytosis of the myelin sheath and can change the surface properties of erythrocytes. LPC-induced demyelination is thought to occur through the actions of recruited macrophages and microglia which phagocytose nearby myelin. Invading T cells are also thought to mediate this process. Bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila utilize phospholipase A2 end- products (fatty acids and lysophospholipids) to cause host cell (macrophage) apoptosis through cytochrome C release. LPCs are present as minor phospholipids in the cell membrane (‚â§ 3%) and in the blood plasma (8‚Äì12%). Since LPCs are quickly metabolized by lysophospholipase and LPC- acyltransferase, they last only shortly in vivo. By replacing the acyl-group within the LPC with an alkyl-group, alkyl-lysophospholipids (ALP) were synthesized. These LPC analogues are metabolically stable, and several such as edelfosine, miltefosine and perifosine are under research and development as drugs against cancer and other diseases. Lysophosphatidylcholine processing has been discovered to be an essential component of normal human brain development: those born with genes that prevent adequate uptake suffer from lethal microcephaly. LPCs occur in many foods naturally. In Starch: Chemistry and Technology third edition on page 592, the authors state that \\"lysophosphatidylcholine makes up about 70% of the lipids in oat starch\\". The anti-cancer abilities of synthetic LPC variants are special since they do not target the cell DNA but insert into the plasma membrane and cause apoptosis through influencing several signal pathways. Therefore, their effects are independent of the proliferation state of the tumor cell.  Industrial Applications of Enzymes Producing Lysophosphatidylcholine FoodPro LysoMaxa Oil is an FDA approved commercialized PLA2 enzyme preparation utilized for the degumming of vegetable oils in large-scale productions to increase yield. Variants of lysophosphatidylcholine are the main products of this enzyme. Lysophosphatidylcholine has been studied as an immune activator for differentiating monocytes to mature dendritic cells. Lysophosphatidylcholine present in blood amplifies microbial TLR ligands induced inflammatory responses from human cells like intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages/monocytes .This has an implication in sepsis induced by microbes.  Composition in Foods  Lysophosphatidylcholine accounts for 4.6% of phospholipids found in coconut oil, which make up 0.2% of lipids in coconut oil. This is compared to vegetable oils, which may contain 2-3% phospholipids.  Lysophosphatidylcholine and Atherosclerosis  Intima-media thickness, which is positively correlated with reduced blood flow, was studied in young smokers. Evidence pointed towards smoking as a major risk factor for increased levels of PLA2, due to tobacco smoke's impact on oxidation of retained LDL particles in the intima of a carotid artery. which may have a detrimental impact on overall health.

History Westwood Marshes Mill was built in the late 18th century, possibly in 1798. It was worked by wind until 1940 and then damaged when used for target practice during World War II. The mill was repaired in the 1950s but in October 1960 it was burnt out in an arson attack. It remains standing in a derelict state. Description Westwood Marshes Mill is a three-storey tower mill. It had a boat-shaped cap which was winded by a tailpole and winch, in a similar manner to the smock mill at Herringfleet. There were four common sails carried on a cast-iron windshaft. The wooden brake wheel drove a wooden wallower which was carried on the wooden upright shaft. This carries a cast-iron spur wheel which drives a cast-iron pit wheel with wooden cogs, carried on a wooden axle, as is the cast-iron scoop wheel with wooden paddles. Only the lower part of the upright shaft and the pit wheel and scoopwheel survived the fire. As well as the scoopwheel, the mill drove a pair of millstones which was used to grind feed for horses on the estate where the mill stood.

Category A structures are those considered to be \\"buildings of national or international importance, either architectural or historic, or fine little-altered examples of some particular period, style or building type.\\" Listing was begun by a provision in the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1947, and the current legislative basis for listing is the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997. The authority for listing rests with Historic Scotland, an executive agency of the Scottish Government, which inherited this role from the Scottish Development Department in 1991. Once listed, severe restrictions are imposed on the modifications allowed to a building's structure or its fittings. Listed building consent must be obtained from local authorities prior to any alteration to such a structure. There are approximately 47,400 listed buildings in Scotland, of which around 8% (or approximately 3,800) are Category A.Guide to the Protection of Scotland‚Äôs Listed Buildings, p. 17. The council area of Na h-Eileanan Siar (Western Isles) comprises an archipelago of over 100 islands and small skerries, including 14 inhabited islands with a total population of around 26,500. There are 18 Category A listed buildings on the islands, representing a variety of types and ages of structure. The 13th-century Church of St Moluag is one of three A-listed church buildings. Kisimul Castle, built on a tiny island off the shore of Castlebay, dates from the 15th century, while the two other A-listed castles at Amhuinnsuidhe and Lews are Victorian. Functional architecture includes three important lighthouses, including Eilean Glas, the first lighthouse in the Western Isles. More prosaic building types are well represented, with eight traditional thatched cottages meriting Category A listing.

Nicola Porpora was invited to be its musical director and Owen Swiny considered as its talent scout. The company had Senesino (who had fallen out with Handel) as its lead singer and was based at a theatre at Lincoln's Inn Fields under John Rich which had become available on Rich's opening of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. The company's first opera was Arianna in Nasso by Porpora, a direct challenge to Handel's Arianna in Creta. The company was not a success in its initial 1733-34 season. Though Farinelli joined it late in the season and thus made it financially solvent, he was unable to prevent its eventual bankruptcy. At the end of its initial season it took over the King's Theatre from Handel. The company went bankrupt and was dissolved in 1737 (shortly after appointing Giovanni Battista Pescetti its musical director), but not before it had poached some of Handel's best singers such as Francesca Cuzzoni and Antonio Montagnana and forced his company into bankruptcy too. The remnants of the two companies combined at the King's Theatre for the 1737-38 season. A second Opera of the Nobility was formed in 1741 by the Earl of Middlesex, but it did not survive for long.

It is a subspecies of the southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) found in subantarctic regions and the Indian Ocean. It is one of the smallest crested penguins and has distinctive pink margins around its bill.  Description  The eastern rockhopper penguin is a small, crested penguin with a black back and throat, a white belly and pink feet. This seabird measures approximately 45‚Äì55 cm in length, and weighs 2.2‚Äì4.3 kg. It has a thin yellow stripe that stretches from its lower forehead, over its red eye and splits into crest feathers at the back of its head. The crest feathers are composed of long, thin, spiky yellow feathers on either side of the penguin‚Äôs head and they are joined by shorter black feathers. Rockhopper penguins have an orange-brown bill and the eastern rockhopper penguin has distinctive pink margins around the bill. Males and females differ in body size and size of their bill; males are generally larger and have a thicker bill. Fledglings, which are around 65 days old, are bluish black all over and lack crest feathers. They also have a smaller, thinner bill than juveniles and adults. Juveniles, which are penguins aged 1 to 2 years old, are a black-brown color with a grey throat. They develop a brown-orange bill that is darker than the adult coloring and have small yellow crest feathers. Eastern rockhopper penguins moult and get their adult plumage at 2 years old.  Taxonomy  The rockhopper penguin can be divided into two species; the northern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes moseleyiI) and the southern rockhopper penguin. These populations differ in many ways including morphological, ecological and behavioural differences. The northern rockhopper penguin is larger than its southern counterpart and has longer crest feathers. Other morphological differences include different color patterns on the underside of their flipper and different size eyestripes. They also exhibit different behavioural traits such as foraging in different water temperatures. Two subspecies of the southern rockhopper penguin are recognized; the eastern and the western rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome). These subspecies differ mainly in their distribution; the western species is found in Cape Horn, South America and the Falkland Islands while its eastern counterpart occupies the Southern Indian and Pacific Ocean. The eastern rockhopper penguin can also be distinguished by its pink margins around the bill.  Habitat and Distribution  The eastern rockhopper penguin is found in the southern Indian and Pacific ocean from Prince Edward Islands to the Antipodes Islands. Rockhopper penguins, in general, occupied a circumpolar distribution in the arctic during breeding season. Eastern rockhopper penguins breed in the Marion Islands, Macquarie island and subantarctic islands in New Zealand such as the Antipodes islands and Campbell island. These penguins occupy a mainly marine pelagic habitat and only return to land to breed and moult. They spend the winter months, approximately April to October, in the southern Indian Ocean foraging for food and can spend up to 6 months at sea. They travel, on average, 2000 to 4000 km away from their breeding site during this winter period. This species mainly forages in cool waters; ocean temperatures of less than 4.5 degrees Celsius. Eastern rockhopper penguins are surface nesters and will build their nest on slopes or rocky shores near the coastline. Colonies will usually form on steep cliffs near the sea and can contain tens-of-thousands of nests. Their nests are made of small pebbles and can occasionally contain some vegetation. Some colonies have settled within grasslands such as tussock, however the soil often erodes down to rock with the accumulation of guano and trampling over a few decades. Eastern rockhopper penguins are rarely found more than 200 meters away from the coastline, since it is ideal to remain near their food supply.  Behavior  = Vocalization = Eastern rockhopper penguins use calls for parent-chick recognition when returning to the colony with food. They also use a song for courtship that can be described as a short repeated rhythmic ascending song. The song of an adult rockhopper penguin can have 5-30 syllables with the first syllable the longest. Their contact call used by chicks and adults is a very short shrill bark. = Diet and foraging = Eastern rockhopper penguins feed on a variety of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods such as krill and squid. Their diet can differ depending on where they are in their life cycle. During their pre-moult season, eastern rockhopper penguins mainly consume crustaceans, while during the breeding period their diet heavily relies on euphausiids in the Marion islands. Different breeding location will also impact their diet; chicks in the Campbell island were found to mainly consume dwarf cod. Rockhopper penguins highly depend on a predictable food source near their nesting habitat to feed their chicks. However, if necessary rockhopper penguins can forage up to 120 km away from their breeding grounds to find food for their chicks. They are diurnal divers; the majority of their foraging activity occurs during the day with the deepest dives occurring at sunrise. When searching for food, they usually stay at a depth of 6m and dive down 30-50m in the water column to catch their prey. They tend to forage in cool waters since they are most productive. They also selected foraging areas with large generation of eddies currents. This type of current supports high aggregations of prey species. The predators of the rockhopper penguin includes fur seals and sea lions. As well, brown skuas (Stercorarius antarcticus) and northern giant petrel (Macronectes halli) prey on rockhopper penguin eggs and chicks. = Reproduction = Breeding season starts in October for eastern rockhopper penguins; males return to the breeding colony first and the females follow shortly after. Courtship begins between pairs and both sexes fast until the female lays the first eggs usually around the beginning of November. After the eggs are laid, the male and female will share all the parental duties. The first incubation period is shared and both parents will fast during this time, approximately 7 days. After this, the female takes the first solo incubation shift while the male goes to forage at sea, this can last up to 3 weeks. Once the male returns, he takes over incubation while the female forages for approximately 10 days, by the time she returns, the chicks have hatched. After the chicks hatch, the male will guard the chicks and continue to fast while the female forages and returns with food for the chicks. The chicks form creches when they are around 24 days old and during this time both parents foraged and return with food. A creche is a common occurrence in bird species when the juveniles form protective groups to allow the parents to forage. Parent penguins continue to feed chicks until they fledge around February when they are approximately 65 days old. Adult penguins will return to the breeding colony in April to moult before their winter at sea.  Threats and Conservation  The eastern rockhopper penguin is considered a vulnerable species due to rapid population declines. This decrease in population is mostly seen in breeding regions since it is the easiest form of census. Most research agrees that the decline in rockhopper penguins is due to low food availability and decrease in food quality driven by climate change. Due to climate change, sea surface and ocean temperatures are changing and this effects the distribution of prey populations. Rockhopper penguins, and many other species, are sensitive to changes in water temperature and as a consequence, adult penguins must forage farther away from breeding colonies. They often return with smaller amounts of food for their chicks which leads to a decrease in body mass. Low food availability also has a large effect on penguin‚Äôs moult period. Moulting is a very energy demanding process and requires penguins have sufficient body mass. Due to poor diet, there is an increase in mortality during the moulting season. Low food quality and abundance in wintering regions have also led to an increase in adult mortality. Climate change has additionally affected the amount and intensity of storms in breeding ranges. Intensity of winds displace prey populations and reduce penguin foraging success.

He has worked for CBC Television, MSNBC, NPR, TVOntario and others. He is currently the writer, producer and host of CBC Radio‚Äôs true- crime podcast series, Someone Knows Something. Early work (1990-2000) Ridgen assisted his brother Robert to make Canadian Images of Vietnam in 1990. The compilation, produced and researched by Robert, was acquired by the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography in 1991. From February to April 2013, Canadian Images of Vietnam was featured in the National Gallery of Canada installation, \\"Clash: Conflict and its Consequences\\". Later work (2000-present) Ridgen's first feature drama, Memento, was released to critical acclaim in 1996 on a riverboat in Kingston, Ontario. In 2000, Ridgen's critically acclaimed documentary about Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, On the Borders of Gardens, earned him a prestigious Canadian Association of Journalists Award. A 2003 film, Buried Alive, made for CBC Television, was about a group of people seeking spiritual enlightenment by digging their own graves and being buried in them overnight. This film won a Bronze Plaque Award at the Columbus International Film and Video Festival. Ridgen made Return to Mississippi in 2004 for CBC Television, about the potential for a trial in the case of the three Mississippi Burning victims: civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney, and Andrew Goodman. During the production of Return to Mississippi, Ridgen learned of the 1964 Klan murder of two 19-year-old African-American men, Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Eddie Moore. This led him to produce his next and probably most famous film, Mississippi Cold Case, a documentary so compelling it led Mississippi state officials to re-open their investigation into the case, which resulted in Klansman James Ford Seale being convicted of conspiracy and kidnapping and handed three concurrent life sentences. Ridgen and Mississippi Cold Case won many awards, including the IRE Top Medal for Investigative Reporting, a Gemini for Best Director, a CAJ for Best Investigative Program, several Yorkton Golden Sheafs including Best of Festival, a CINE Golden Eagle and an Emmy Nomination for Best Investigative Documentary. Ridgen's 2009 documentary, American Radical: The Trials of Norman Finkelstein, co-directed and co- produced with Nicolas Rossier, was about the life of controversial political scientist Norman Finkelstein. American Radical was released in 2009, premiering at the Chicago Underground Film Festival and winning the Audience Choice Award. The film went on to screen at dozens of festivals and venues worldwide, earning another Audience Award at the Cinema Politica/RIDM Festival. American Radical had its world television premiere on Israeli Television, Yes, and also aired on Al Jazeera and RT. =Work with Civil Rights Cold Case Project= In 2008, Ridgen, along with John Fleming of the Anniston Star, spearheaded The Civil Rights Cold Case Projectcoldcases.org with Paperny Films and the Center for Investigative Reporting. The Project brought together partners from across the media and legal spectrum to reveal long-neglected truths behind scores of race-motivated murders from the civil rights era, and to help facilitate reconciliation and healing. The Project sponsored work in other Civil Rights era cold cases, including the 1964 Klan murders of two African Americans: shoe-shop owner Frank Morris, murdered in Ferriday, Louisiana, and Clifton Walker, a Natchez, Mississippi mill worker. In 2011, Ridgen worked with Civil Rights Cold Case Project members Stanley Nelson and David Paperny to produce Murder at the Shoe Shop, a radio documentary for NPR and CBC Television, about the Frank Morris case. The documentary aired the same day Stanley Nelson published an article in the Concordia Sentinel newspaper revealing for the first time the identity of Arthur Leonard Spencer, a man alleged to have participated in Morris' murder. Weeks later, the U.S. Department of Justice initiated a Grand Jury proceeding into the Morris case. =Investigative films= Ridgen has made four investigative films about alleged cold cases for the CBC. The first, A Garden of Tears (2009), was about the 1975 murder of Kathryn Mary Herbert in Abbotsford, British Columbia. The second, The Bomb that Killed Wayne Greavette (2009), about the killing of Greavette through the use of a flashlight bomb sent in the mail, was nominated for two 2010 Gemini Awards. The third, Sharin (2010), was about the brutal 1983 murder of nine-year-old Sharin' Morningstar Keenan and the search for the prime suspect Dennis Melvyn Howe. Ridgen's fourth film in his Canadian Cold Case series, Confession to Murder Part I (2012), was about the 1993 disappearance of 15-year-old Christine Harron and a man named Anthony Edward Ringel who allegedly confessed 11 years later to killing her. The documentary revealed that Ringel was discharged before trial due to police errors and rulings on evidence admissibility. Confession to Murder Part I aired on May 18, 2012, the 19th anniversary of Christine's disappearance. It was nominated for a 2013 Canadian Screen Award and on the evening of the awards, February 27, 2013, Anthony Edward Ringel was re- arrested by the Ontario Provincial Police and charged with the first degree murder of Christine Harron; police saying they had obtained fresh evidence. A Confession to Murder Part II aired on CBC Television March 8, 2013, with information about Anthony Ringel's re-arrest.  Someone Knows Something  In 2016, Ridgen launched Someone Knows Something, CBC Radio‚Äôs first true-crime podcast. The show investigates small-town cold cases, and reports on them in near real time. The first season focuses on the 1972 disappearance of Adrien McNaughton, a five-year-old boy who vanished during a family fishing trip in Eastern Ontario. The McNaughton family is from Arnprior, Ontario. Ridgen grew up in Arnprior, moving there with his family shortly after Adrien‚Äôs disappearance. Season 2 focuses on the 1998 disappearance of Sheryl Sheppard, a 29-year-old woman who vanished on New Years Day in Hamilton, Ontario. Her mother Odette Fisher has spent almost 19 years searching for her missing daughter.CBC Radio, Listen to SKS Season 2 on CBC Radio One this summer. Accessed December 1, 2018. In Season 3 David revisits his documentary Mississippi Cold Case. - In 1964, the remains of Charles Moore and Henry Dee were found in the Mississippi River. But no one was convicted. 40 years later, Charles's brother Thomas returns to Mississippi with David Ridgen to reopen the case and confront the Klan. (6 Episodes Only) In Season 4, David revisits his case of Wayne Greavette's death by a bomb mailed to him as a flashlight.

At present it comprises seven Institutes and four Colleges of secondary vocational education.Contemporary Educational Programmes - Education in Russia Novgorod State UniversityCampus Europae A new member in Campus Europae! It is unusual that the Novgorod State University has the name of Prince Yaroslav the Wise incorporated into its title. On the eve of the University's first anniversary, the Prince's personal seal was discovered during archaeological excavations. Academician Yanin considered it a remarkable coincidence and suggested awarding the University the name of the Russian prince. Higher education in Novgorod in the 18th-20th centuries The first attempt to open a higher educational institution in Novgorod dates back to 1740, when the Novgorodian Archbishop Ambrose (Yushkevich) founded the Novgorod Theological Seminary. As a graduate of the Kiev-Mohyla Academy, Archbishop Ambrose planned to create an exact copy of his alma mater in Novgorod. From the very beginning, the activities of the Novgorod Theological Seminary were thoroughly regulated and properly funded (7859 rubles 37 kopecks per year were allocated for its maintenance). This amount of money was much higher than the financial support of other seminaries in the Russian Empire at that time. On April 12, 1741, he sent a report to the regent Anna Leopoldovna, declaring his intention to built \\"not a seminary, but a large Academy following the example of the Kiev schools ... the monastery of Anthony of Rome\\", where \\"should be 10 schools according to the state, also a stone library for keeping books, and for better order and observation of this Academy... archimandrite and rector ... following the example of the Kiev and Moscow Academies\\", and also asked \\"to approve this academy with a privilege (certificate), following the example of Kiev, Kharkov and other foreign academies\\".

Archbishop Ambrose made special efforts to organize the seminary library. In 1740, 300 rubles a year were allocated to equip the library. No seminary in the Russian Empire received such funding. Ambrose handed over the book collection of the Novgorod bishop's house to the seminary library, which included the library of the Novgorod school of Likhud Brothers, and also obtained permission from Empress Elizabeth Petrovna to transfer the library of Theophan (Prokopovich) to the seminary. The building of the former Theological Seminary in the Antoniev Monastery Ultimately, however, the main resources were directed to the development of education in St. Petersburg. So in 1788, the upper classes of the Novgorod Theological Seminary, on the initiative of Metropolitan Gabriel (Petrov) of Novgorod and St. Petersburg, were transferred to St. Petersburg for 11 years in order to raise the level of education in the Alexander Nevsky Seminary, which in 1797 was transformed into the Theological Academy. Thus, for all the subsequent tsarist times, neither a theological academy nor a secular university was opened in Novgorod. In the 19th century, the Novgorod Theological Seminary had few fundamental differences from other theological seminaries in the country. However, even then it possessed unique traditions and a remarkable library. On September 30, 1918, the Novgorod government department of public education decided to close the Novgorod Theological Seminary, and on October 1, 1919, the Novgorod Institute of Public Education was opened on its basis. The fundamental library of the seminary was transferred to that institute. In 1934, the Novgorod Institute of Public Education was transformed into the Novgorod State Teachers' Institute, and then, in 1953, into the Novgorod State Pedagogical Institute. In the same period, in 1964, a branch campus of the Leningrad Electrotechnical Institute was formed in Novgorod, on the basis of which the Novgorod Polytechnic Institute was established in 1973. In parallel, in 1969, the Novgorod branch campus of distant education of the Leningrad Agricultural Institute was established, and then, in 1986, the Novgorod State Agricultural Institute was opened.  Novgorod State University  On June 30, 1993, the Prime Minister V.S.Chernomyrdin signed the Resolution: \\"On the formation of the Novgorod State University\\" on the basis of the Novgorod State Polytechnic Institute and the Novgorod State Pedagogical Institute.

On the eve of the celebration of the first university anniversary, at the Troizkiy excavation site in Novgorod, the lead seal of Prince Yaroslav the Wise was found, indicating that he, already being a Kiev prince, retained a direct influence on the development of Novgorod. At the suggestion of the head of the Novgorod archaeological expedition, academician V. L. Yanin, who was supported by the members of the Academic Council of Novgorod State University and the regional administration, the new university was named after Yaroslav the Wise in recognition of his merits. On June 15, 1995, by order of the founder and first rector (president) of NovSU Vladimir Vasilyevich Soroka the museum of the Novgorod State University was created on the basis of the museums of the Novgorod State Polytechnic Institute and Novgorod State Pedagogical Institute. The museum was located in the building of the Humanitarian Institute in the Antoniev Monastery (The building of the former theological seminary). On January 15, 1997, by order of the Government of the Russian Federation, based on the decision of the Academic Councils of the Novgorod State Agricultural Academy (NSAA) and Novgorod State University, the NSAA was incorporated into the university as a structural unit: the School of Agriculture and Natural Resources.

They started as a collective of several artists, musicians and designers and created the art'ntainment concept. Their debut album The Jade Motel was released in Sweden on 30 April 2008, reaching number fifty-three on the Swedish Albums Chart. They were by then only three members: Pearl, Princess and Mattias. Zeigeist were characterized as an electropop band with remarkable performances and shows, with a clash of music and art performance. They made special clothes, often big haute-couture-like dresses and used effects like fake blood, make-up, confetti, and various stage designs. Among their special shows was the one at the Swedish Arvikafestivalen 2007, where they made a dystopian performance in three acts with short novel films, produced only for this show, in between the acts.Zeigeist, Arvikafestivalen on YouTube They made extraordinary photo shoots, like the studio photo with Princess surrounded in feathers and Pearl with paint dripping on his chest. They had several hits, with the best known \\"Tar Heart\\" being named as one of the smartest marketing ideas during the Myspace era, when it was erroneously tagged on an early leak of The Knife's 2006 album Silent Shout under the name \\"F as in Knife\\", and became a big mystery until it was explained that it actually was a Zeigeist song named \\"Tar Heart\\". Pitchfork Media placed the leaked demo of \\"Tar Heart\\" at number sixty on their list of \\"The Top 100 Tracks of 2006\\".

Privately funded, nonprofit and nonpartisan, it is part of the umbrella Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. The Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund was founded in 1972 by three lawyers, one of whom, Cesar A. Perales, became the president of the group for much of its history. PRLDEF played a key role in the installation of bilingual education in New York City schools, and soon became the most important legal advocacy group for Puerto Ricans in the U.S. mainland. The group became known for the part it played in redistricting battles, for its opposition to civil service exams it thought discriminatory, and for its attempts to combat anti-Latino sentiment especially as arising from the debate over immigration to the U.S. It changed its name to the current one in 2008 in order to reflect demographic shifts in the Latino population in New York and elsewhere. Origins and the 1970s The Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund was founded in 1972 as a non-profit organization by three lawyers, Jorge Batista, Victor Marrero, and Cesar A. Perales, with Perales the fund's first president. It was created as a privately funded, nonprofit and nonpartisan organization with the goal of changing discriminatory practices via advocacy and litigation. It was inspired in form and purpose by the high-profile NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which Thurgood Marshall had established in 1957. PRLDEF (pronounced \\"pearl-deaf\\") had $300,000 of initial funding from foundations, government sources, and private corporations. U.S. House of Representatives member Herman Badillo was on its first Board of Directors, and at the fund's initial press conference he said, \\"There is plenty of room for change in our society, and much can be done through the medium of class actions.\\" The organization soon grew to have a Litigation Division, a Pro Bono Cooperating Counsel Division, and an Education Division. A typical staffer was a young, idealistic attorney from a premier law school. The fund's first lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Hispanic educational improvement organization, ASPIRA of New York in an action against the New York City Board of Education. It led to the August 1974 ASPIRA Consent Decree, which established the right of city public school students with limited English proficiency to receive bilingual education. The decree was a key factor in bilingual education spreading throughout the city school system. It also brought about the publication of some federal and state forms in Spanish as well as English. By the late 1970s, PRLDEF had become the nation's most important legal advocacy group for Puerto Ricans in the mainland. 1980s and 1990s In 1981, PRLDEF achieved its most visible early triumph when a federal court intervened to block a city Democratic Party primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters. The council district lines were redrawn in consequence of the ruling. (A similar action was taken in 1991 to forestall a planned redrawing, and subsequent negotiations with the U.S. Justice Department resulted in changes to the redistricting.) Also in 1981, the fund began activity in opposition to reinstatement of the death penalty in New York State, with its board saying that \\"capital punishment is associated with evident racism in our society.\\" The fund was also active in highlighting cases of police brutality. During the 1980s, PRLDEF changed its focus somewhat, moving beyond traditional civil rights cases to address more economically focused issues such as wage disparities. A major target became civil service exams, which the fund believed were unfair to Latinos and other minority groups. In 1984, the fund sued the New York City Police Department, saying that its promotion exams discriminated against Latinos and African- Americans. The case was settled when the department agreed to promote an additional 100 black officers and 60 Latino officers to sergeant rank. The fund also filed separate suits against the New York City Fire Department and the New York City Department of Sanitation. The fund actively opposed the 1987 Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination, \\"because of the threat he poses to the civil rights of the Latino community,\\" and worked on joining anti-Bork coalitions. The same year, the fund teamed with community organizers ACORN on behalf of affordable housing for low-income Puerto Rican families in East New York. It also met with editors of the New York Daily News to complain about \\"negative images of Puerto Ricans presented by the News' staff,\\" especially those coming from popular columnist Jimmy Breslin. Future federal judge and U.S. Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor was an active member of the board of directors of PRLDEF from 1980 to 1992. Board members were often chosen for their wealth or their political connections and have included U.S. Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, Senator Jacob Javits, Ambassador William vanden Heuvel, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams, and federal judge Jos√© A. Cabranes. Co-founder Victor Marrero became a federal judge and returned to serve on the board as well. The extent to which the board's Litigation Committee had control over which lawsuits went forward varied over time and was a subject of intermittent discussion. The group endured financial strain several times, and in 1984, private contributions suffered due to a dispute between management and staff over control of the fund. Under president and general counsel Juan Figueroa, who joined the group in 1993, PRLDEF forged a strategic plan that led to an alliance with the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy in 1998. Search for 'juan figueroa'. The Institute functioned as the Fund‚Äôs policy research arm. As a result, PRLDEF had an expanded role in the public policy community, a higher national profile, and an integrated program that effectively united grassroots advocacy, public policy and precedent-setting litigation. PRLDEF cases included language rights, education, voting rights and environmental justice. 2000s and a new name The group's logo as of 2002 By 2003, the group was in severe financial crisis. Perales, who had since gone on to become a high- ranking official at the city, state, and federal levels, was brought back to serve as president. In 2005, the former Institute for Puerto Rican Policy split back off, renaming itself the National Institute for Latino Policy. PRLDEF itself was a member organization of the umbrella Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. In the 2000s, PRLDEF collaborated with the New York Legal Assistance Group, suing the United States Government for delays in the processing of immigration applications. PRLDEF was also known to collaborate with the Hispanic National Bar Association. After the town of Hazleton, Pennsylvania passed an ordinance to punish landlords who rented to illegal immigrants and businesses who hired illegal immigrants, the American Civil Liberties Union and the PRLDEF sued Hazleton, saying the law was unconstitutional.ACLU of Pennsylvania, Lozano v. City of Hazleton webpage , including links to press releases, complaint, and other materials.Tom Head, \\"Top 10 Civil Liberties News Stories - Aug. 22, 2006 Edition\\", About.com. Perales said, \\"What [the ordinance] is about is an anti-Latino sentiment that has been growing in this country.\\" On July 26, 2007, a federal court agreed and struck down the Hazleton ordinance; Hazleton's mayor promised to appeal the decision. The Hazleton challenge became PRLDEF's most visible work of that period. In July 2010, the group co-authored an amicus curiae brief filed by several Latino organizations that sought to block the highly controversial Arizona SB 1070 anti-illegal immigration law. The following month, PRLDEF said that was ready to sue the state of Virginia if its governor allowed the Virginia State Police to ask about the immigration status of individuals they stop or arrest, stating that such a policy would result in racial profiling. In addition to its other efforts, the Education Division of PRLDEF encourages Latinos to become lawyers by offering LSAT prep courses, internships, and mentoring relationships. Those endeavors have assisted as many as 300 Latino and African-Americans students a year and helped create a generation of minority lawyers. In October 2008, the group changed its name to LatinoJustice PRLDEF. Perales said that \\"there is a coming together of identification in a common struggle,\\" especially in regards to immigration issues. But the change was also motivated by broad demographic shifts; when the organization had first been formed, Puerto Ricans comprised about 63 percent of the overall New York Latino population. This figure had now fallen to about 34 percent, and the group's clients were coming from Bolivia, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and the like. The move opened up additional fundraising opportunities, but also caused some Puerto Ricans to criticize the group for forsaking its heritage. The organization received new national attention in mid-2009 with the Sonia Sotomayor Supreme Court nomination, with Republicans saying Sotomayor had been involved in a radical organization while Democrats defended it as a mainstream civil rights operation. Perales said, \\"You have a reputable group that has stood up for the civil rights of Latinos for 37 years. To suddenly be accused of being something bad, and that anyone associated with it should not be allowed to serve on the Supreme Court, to me is shocking.\\" Mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg came to PRLDEF's defense, saying \\"While we have not always agreed on every issue, the group has made countless important contributions to New York City.\\" In December 2008, LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed an unusual international petition with the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States, charging that the United States was failing to protect Latinos living within its borders and was thus falling short of several human rights manifestos. In March 2010, the group urged Governor of Puerto Rico Luis Fortu√±o to delay by at least six months the effective date of a new birth certificate law, which as of July 2010 would invalidate all previously issued birth certificates. PRLDEF was concerned that the new law, whose objective was to stop identity theft and fraud, would harm Stateside Puerto Ricans applying for a driver's license or a job. (The governor delayed the law by three months.) In 2011, Perales stepped down as president of the organization and was replaced by civil rights lawyer Juan Cartagena. Perales was subsequently named Secretary of State of New York.

So it is a difficult as well as an important issue. Housing designed for older people whose needs change as they age faces an almost built-in conflict of interest. They need more services as they age, so the costs are going to rise as more care is provided. Their income tends to be less over the years. They wish to reduce the cost but they need more services. Older and frailer residents are more costly, so when residents manage the schemes themselves they may wish to sell to active, fit and therefore younger people.‚Äù Personal life In 1959, she married Alan Greengross; they have three daughters and one son.\\"Greengross, Baroness, (Life Peer)\\", International Who's Who of Women 2002 Alan died in August, 2018.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/register/sir-alan-greengross- obituary-62cqsggxk She is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society Honours She holds honorary doctorates from a number of British universities.

The best-preserved charcoal and bone samples were identified by prescreening in the field and laboratory. The dates range from around 21,000 to 13,800 cal BP. The age of the ancient pottery ranges between 18,300 and 15,430 cal BP. Charcoal and bone collagen samples located above and below one of the fragments produced dates of around 18,000.

History After the Air Force became a separate department, the Air Force Chief of Staff designated the Office of the Inspector General to oversee all inspection and safety functions. These functions were consolidated in an inspector general group at Norton AFB, Calif., in the 1950s. On Dec. 31, 1971, the Air Force Inspection and Safety Center was activated, replacing the 1002nd Inspector General Group. The center was then divided into the Air Force Inspection Agency and the Air Force Safety Agency in August 1991. Reorganization of the air staff in 1992 created the Air Force Chief of Safety position, reporting directly to the Air Force Chief of Staff. The Chief of Safety became dual- hatted as the commander of the Air Force Safety Agency. In July 1993, the agency moved to Kirtland AFB due to the closure of Norton AFB. Following The Blue Ribbon Panel on Aviation Safety in 1995, the Air Force Safety Center was activated on Jan. 1, 1996, when the Air Force Chief of Safety and support staff moved from Washington, D.C., to consolidate all safety functions at Kirtland AFB. The Chief of Safety position was changed from a brigadier general to a major general. The Deputy Chief of Safety/Executive Director position was created in October 2003 to oversee the daily functions of the center. The Chief of Safety and support staff moved back to the Pentagon in April 2004.

History International Association of Sufism (IAS) was founded by Sufi Masters Dr. Nahid Angha and Shah Nazar Seyyed Dr. Ali Kianfar in 1983. Dr. Nahid Angha is the eldest child of Shah Maghsoud Sadegh Angha (the twentieth century Persian Sufi) and Mahtalat Etemad-Moghadam. Dr. Angha was the first woman appointed to teach in her father's school, the Uwaisi Tariqat, in the late 1960s. She was also the first woman to sit at the center circle with Muslim Sufi leaders from around the world to lead meditation at the International Sufism Symposium. She is one of the major Sufi scholars and writers of our time, the author or over fifteen published books and many articles. She is also a human rights advocate. Dr. Angha is the main representative of the IAS to the United Nations DPI/NGO, and was featured in media and publications including: White Fire: A Portrait of Women Spiritual Leaders in America; Women in Sufism: A Hidden Treasure; Sufi Women: the Journey towards the Beloved; and Wisdom Keepers Project among others. Nahid Angha is the founder of the Sufi Women's Organization, a women's rights organization with seventeen chapters around the globe. Her dedication to global peace has also earned the IAS a Messenger of Peace Award 2000 from UNESCO and an Ambassadorship status from the UNICEF for IAS: Voices for Justice. Dr. Angha is the first Muslim woman inducted to the Marin Women's Hall of Fame and was the Visionary Marin honoree of 2012. She has lectured throughout the world including at the UN, at the CPWR in Cape Town, in Barcelona, Spain, at the Smithsonian Institution, the Compassion conference in Germany, Science and Spirituality in Italy, Universal Forum of Cultures in Mexico, and was among the distinguished Muslim leaders and scholars invited to gather for the first annual Shakir World Encounters, an Islamic conference of peace in Marrakech, Morocco. Shah Nazar Seyed Dr. Ali Kianfar is a disciple of Moulana Shah Maghsoud, 20th Century Persian Master of the Uwaiysi Tariqat. He began studying Sufism under the guidance and supervision of his Master of Tariq, Moulana Shah Maghsoud, and was appointed by him to teach and lead gatherings. An internationally published author and a commentator of the Qur'an, Dr. Kianfar has taught Sufism and Islamic Philosophy for over 40 years. He has lectured throughout the world including Australia, Scotland, Egypt, and was a keynote speaker at a conference organized by the government of Uzbekistan and UNESCO on the topic of Interreligious Dialogue and Peace, in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

Departments The IAS has several departments: =Sufi Women= IAS-SWO and the Sufi Women Organization, founded by Dr. Nahid Angha and with the efforts and contributions of Sufi women from around the globe, was established in 1993 under the auspices of the International Association of Sufism. A forum for all women, it has been tremendously successful in gathering together women from diverse cultural backgrounds who share a dedication to the goals of Sufism, especially with respect to human rights. SWO's primary humanitarian goals include women's rights, education, and social awareness. The devotion of all who have volunteered their time, energy and expertise have led to many substantial achievements: opening lines of communication among Sufi women from many different schools throughout the world, bringing the influence and the leadership of Sufi women into the traditional Sufi gatherings, taking active leadership roles within the global community through interfaith organizations, Amnesty International, Habitats for Humanity, UNICEF, UNESCO, and the United Nations. SWO works with diverse community services programs including Women's Wisdom, Women in Action educational conference series, Prison Project, Literacy Program, and more. It provides classes and a meditation series for Sufi women. SWO also introduces Sufi women's accomplishments in art, literature, poetry, teachings, and practices in publications distributed internationally and through the SWO Quarterly Newsletter, Lecture Series Luncheon Programs, and annual Sufism Symposium meeting. SWO established an electronic mail news group and web site to facilitate sharing among Sufi women and created a forum for exchanging ideas, traditions and teachings among Sufi women from different orders and cultures. Sufi Women's Organization has also worked for over eight months on an international forum to create a Code of Ethics which is honored by its members throughout the world. SWO has partnered with other humanitarian organizations in support of peace and humanitarian efforts. This includes contributions towards medical and humanitarian aid for the Haiti disaster, support and contributions towards Project Amigo which offers scholarships, tutoring, clothing, books, medical, dental and other services for children from low income families in Mexico.

SWO worked with Amnesty International in support of works towards women's rights and equality. Another important Program of the SWO is the \\"SWO Lecture Series,\\" a quarterly lecture series organized to introduce and honor outstanding women and learn from their knowledge and wisdom. This program has continued since 1993. SWO also holds an annual meeting when many members from around the world gather for a weekend. Some of these events include Harvest Your Treasure, Women's Meditation Circle, and more. =Sufi Psychology Forum= The Sufism and Psychology Forum (SPF) has been created to explore the relationship between the study of Sufism and psychology; conduct research in the field of Sufi psychology; expand the SPF research library; present Sufi psychology studies at academic and professional conferences; sponsor seminars and lectures presented by spiritually oriented psychologists and therapists. Members of the SPF have advanced degrees in psychology and are skilled therapists. They are working to bring the application of Sufi principles and practices together with the study of psychology through research, translation, and discussion. The Sufi Psychology Forum is a department of IAS and is not affiliated with any one Sufi school or order. Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam, is a practice of self- purification and spiritual alignment that supports the practitioner's quest to discover Ultimate Reality. Teachers of this tradition direct practitioners to discover truths about the self and reality that extend past ideas about such topics commonly found through ritual, religion or intellectual banter. It is taught within the school that in the depths of one's consciousness exists a presence not touched by time, place or circumstance. This is the actualized self or divine incarnate. In this way, the serious Sufi practitioner understands life to be a journey towards acquiring direct knowledge to further experience the actualized self and he strives to constantly work to minimize attention on all that distracts from this goal. Within the field of psychology, originally inspired by religion and philosophy, the human being is generally studied according to his behavior and thought processes. Psychologists practice within a range of specialties and modalities but all typically focus on how cognition, behavior, emotion, physiology, personality, interpersonal relationships and that within the unconscious help to understand the human experience. By better understanding such dynamics within oneself as mirrored by the psychologist, the patient or client is thought to have a greater sense of purpose, freedom and ability to make more informed choices about one's thinking and behavior. Sufi psychology, similar to humanistic and transpersonal psychology (two schools also interested in the spiritual dimension of the human being), suggests there is something very important missing in western psychology regarding human potential. For instance, thinkers within Sufi psychology, influenced by many centuries of Sufi philosophy and spiritual practice, are confident that the question \\"who am I\\" can be answered versus guessed. They see the purpose and identity of the human being as not the accumulation of what one does, feels or thinks but as a very specific holder of a potential, capable to understand all facets of one's existence, or one's essence and answer one's previous existential questions. It is understood in the tradition of Sufism that before a practitioner has experientially recognized his essential nature through contemplation and psychological purification, he is merely identifying with various self- conceptualizations. These self-conceptualizations are mental or egoic representations of who the person thinks he is, instead of experientially knowing one's essential nature. Self-identifying in this way is considered to limit holistic self-understanding as self-conceptualizations naturally fluctuate. Contemporary Sufi Master Seyyed Dr. Ali Kianfar describes the limitation of such self-conceptualizations when most people introduce themselves. After sharing various details about their interests or accomplishments, one cannot further express who they are: > But there arrives a point where there is less and less to say. He searches > for a point of finality, to complete the picture‚Äîyet he cannot find such a > point. He realizes that the description will not do him justice. It may be > honest and true, and yet be radically incomplete and its incompleteness > cannot be made whole by additional description by more words, by language > itself. (Kianfar, 1996, p. 67) Masters and scholars of Sufism emphasize that there is an innate knowledge available that initiates both one's initial curiosity of \\"who am I, really?\\" as well as the motivation to remain devoted to self-discovery. Sufi Master and theologian (12th century) Al-Ghazali (2010) describes that the \\"distinguishing characteristic\\" of the human being is \\"his experiential knowledge of the real nature of things\\" (p. 25). To discover this knowledge first necessitates that one become aware that despite the appearance of multiplicity and constant change within existence, there is a foundation of existence within him that is unchanging. He gradually recognizes that what he currently understands is limited and relative compared to understanding Ultimate Reality, or reality as it is, versus any conceptualization. Dr. Nahid Angha (1991a), contemporary Sufi Master, describes that \\"the goal of a Sufi\\" is to \\"witness\\" the \\"direct spiritual and personal reality, which is hidden behind the distracting colors of mere surface phenomena\\" (p. 8). Therefore Sufi psychology expands the traditional psychological paradigm. It asks the human being if he would like to contact his yearning to truly be and directs him towards a higher developmental possibility. While Sufi Psychology also explores one's thought processes and behavior, it does so to help the practitioner remove or purify all psychological obstacles that keep one attached or identified with a limited view of oneself. The more he understands himself, he can eventually and completely move out of constant attachment to ups and downs of mood experienced from not yet having true self-understanding. Through this purification process and contemplation about what is beyond one's distractions, one's self-awareness deepens. After accessing a taste of this knowledge, of the freedom from living from this new position, one now has a new vantage point about himself and the meaning of his life. He protects himself and his experience from being negatively affected. He does not allow anyone to affect his value or potential. He begins to act more humanely and peacefully. He revels in the awareness of his being as it gradually becomes more and more clear. Dr. Kianfar started the Sufism and Psychology Forum (SPF) in 1996 along with psychologists participating with the International Association of Sufism. This forum was designed to integrate Sufi wisdom with western psychology and offer discussion about how studying the integration of these two principles could help further human development and self- understanding. Members of SPF support such ongoing discussion through research projects, presentations at conferences, seminars and retreats, and through a newsletter and publications. Publications include: Psychology in Sufism, Vol. I by Amelia Amineh Pryor, Ph.D., MFT. The Sacred Journey: Unfolding Self Essence by Ellen Arife Hammerle Ph. D., MFT, Sufism: Self, Path and Guide by Amelia Amineh Pryor, Ph. D., MFT, and The Book of Self by Sarah Hastings Mullin Ph. D. 40 Days: Alchemy of Tranquility program is a subgroup of the SPF led by Dr. Angha and Dr. Kianfar and assisted by a team of experienced psychotherapists and educators. This program offers group retreats annually and also individual mentoring throughout the year, supporting participants' opportunity and direction for increased self-awareness, self-development and healing. In this program, the participant embarks on a concentrated practice with deep intention to focus on one's inner experience within forty day increments. One can then measure one's development after each period. During the forty day periods or chelleh, the participant is guided by experienced Sufi masters along with a self-selected mentor trained in psychology. The team of psychologists and educators of the 40 Days include: Sheikh Salman Baruti, MFT Rahmana Lynn Larkin, MFT George Machette, MFT Ginny Salima Patton Machette, MFT Amelia Amineh Pryor, Ph. D., MFT Sarah Hastings Mullin, Ph. D. Mary Toth Granick, MFT Jamal Lawrence Granick, MFT, Ph.D. Ellen Arife Hammerle, Ph. D, MFT Katherine Preston, M. A., MFT Jalal Brian Heery, Ph. D Community Healing Centers, another subdivision, is the clinical branch of SPF. The Center provides integrative psychological services to the community. Offices are in San Francisco, Novato, Mill Valley and Albany. CHC practitioners offer the integration of Western psychology and ancient wisdom in individual psychotherapy, groups, and workshops. =Voices for Justice= Voices for Justice consists of a group of youth leader advocates for the rights of children by providing a forum for public awareness through: education, community service, events and programs. Voices for Justice wants every child and every young adult to have the opportunity to fulfill his or her highest potential. Voices for Justice is a UNICEF's Ambassador, and was nominated for the Heart of Marin's Award. =Institute for Sufi Studies= The Institute for Sufi Studies (ISS) is a collaborative education and research effort that invites people from around the world with the common interest of Sufism to join together for research and study of this ancient wisdom. ISS is an educational department of the International Association of Sufism (IAS). The Institute for Sufi Studies offers classes directly through its center, on- line through the Internet, and at other educational institutions. The faculty are all practitioners of Sufism and teachers in many diverse disciplines, including religion, literature, psychology, philosophy, sociology, and physics. =Taneen Sufi Music= Taneen Sufi Music Ensemble is based in the San Francisco Bay Area, members of Taneen are all salekin (students) of the Sufi Masters Shah Nazar Seyyed Dr. Ali Kianfar and Dr. Nahid Angha. With an authentic fusion of Middle Eastern Sufi and Western musical influences, and deeply rooted in the Sufi tradition in its intention and inspiration, Taneen creates original melodies that wrap Sufi chant around sung Sufi poetry. They primarily sing the ecstatic love poetry of the great masters (such as Rumi, Hafez, Omar Khayam, and Moulana Shah Maghsoud) translated into English by Dr. Nahid Angha. The resulting melodies are the profound message of love which the Sufis profess is accessible to all audiences. Taneen has performed before international audiences at such events as the annual Sufism Symposium, the Parliament of World's Religions, the Nobel Peace Institute, the United Nation's 50th Anniversary Celebration, and many other events. Programs Its programs include Building Bridges of Understanding, a cooperative educational program, including conference organization, which it runs in cooperation with Humanities Department of Dominican University of California, Conference co- sponsored with the IAS. with support from the Marin Community Foundation; Forty Days: Alchemy of Tranquility, which consists of workshops allowing participants to access their hidden wisdom and to use it in daily life; Sufi Symposium, an international, multicultural festival; and Voices for Justice. =Symposia= The annual International Sufi Symposium, sponsored by the International Association of Sufism, attracts hundreds of Sufis from around the world. For example, at the 2002 event held in Seattle, Washington, USA, 700 Sufis were scheduled to attend. At the 2000 symposium, \\"The Need for Sufism in a New Century - An Old Tradition for a New World\\", IAS co-founder Dr Ali Kianfar delivered a speech entitled \\"Self and Discovery\\". He said: The 2001 symposium, held in Fremont, California, had the theme of \\"The Soul's Longing: A Language of Spirit\\", where attendees explored \\"the wisdom and beauty of Sufism in society\\".

Arife Ellen Hammerle wrote an article entitled Women and Islam for Human Beams magazine in August 1999. Speaking from her personal experiences as a woman, mother, Sufi and American, she relates: IAS is modernist despite its traditional Sufi trappings. In the preface to The Sufi orders in Islam, John O.Voll talks of the growing strength of Sufi tariqas amongst modern people who are not trying to escape modernity, that traditionalists would have difficulty conceiving or crediting, citing the International Association of Sufism, whose annual meeting in California was attended by 800 people in 1996. See Amazon page In Sufism and the 'Modern' in Islam, the authors write: \\"The [IAS] is very much in the avant-garde of transnational Sufism, hardly resembling traditional orders or spirituality at all. Instead, it represents itself as an 'educational organization' and a UN affiliated NGO that carries out a UN Human Rights project.\\" See Amazon page International cooperation Working with other faiths, Community Healing Centers director, Uwaiysi Sufi and qualified psychotherapist, Arife Ellen Hammerle, was invited to make a presentation at the Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions in 1999.

In addition to her performances on stage and screen, Lawson was known for her romantic affairs, including with tennis player Fred Perry and her future husband, the married son of the Dame of Sark. Lawson and her husband died in the Second World War during a German bombing raid on Liverpool.  Early life  Mary Lawson was born in Darlington, County Durham, England on 30 August 1910. She grew up in a humble terraced house on 58 Pease Street on the Freeholders' Estate in Darlington and attended Dodmire School. The Lawsons were a working-class family that had relocated from Gateshead to Darlington several years before Mary's birth. Lawson's father, Thomas Ed Lawson (b. 1876), was an assistant fitter for the North Eastern Railway Company, while her mother, Jane Hood Lawson (b. 1875), died when Mary was only three. As a result, Mary was largely raised by her elder sister Dorothy (b. 1899). Mary also had two brothers: John (b. 1896) and Francis James (b. 1906)  Stage and film career  Lawson began performing at a young age. When she was only five she sang at Feethams for soldiers wounded during the First World War and soon became a regular at Darlington's Scala theatre on Eldon Street. Lawson took on other roles and in 1920 she had a part in a Babes in the Wood panto. At the age of twelve she led a performing group of young girls that toured County Durham for three years. In addition to her pure acting ability, Lawson developed into an exceptional dancer. In her mid-teens she landed a role in a panto in Brighton and later performed in Frinton-on-Sea in Essex, where she was spotted by comedian Gracie Fields. With Fields's support, Lawson was able to become the resident act at The May Fair Hotel in London. Lawson incorporated into her show the song Varsity Drag from the musical Good News, which at the time was being performed by American Zelma O'Neal at the Carlton Theatre in the West End. Her performance was such a success that when O'Neal returned to the United States, the Carlton Theatre choose 17-year-old Lawson as her replacement. Lawson made her name on stage in 1928 at the Carlton in the role Flo in the production of Good News. In 1929, Lawson departed for Australia on a tour, where she appeared in the productions of The Desert Song and Hold Everything!. Coliseum Theatre in London. By the early 1930s, Lawson had established herself on the stage as a musical comedy star, able to earn fifty to sixty British pounds a week, and in 1933 she entered into the British film industry. Though she eventually acted in more than a dozen films, her screen career never matched her stage success. Her first major role was as Susie in Colonel Blood, which starred Frank Cellier. The most successful film that Lawson had a role in was the 1935 production of Scrooge, which starred Seymour Hicks and Donald Calthrop. She also appeared in films that included in their cast such notable actors as Stanley Holloway in D'Ye Ken John Peel? and Cotton Queen, Will Fyffe in Cotton Queen, and Vivien Leigh in Things Are Looking Up, and Bud Flanagan in A Fire Has Been Arranged. Lawson's last film was Oh Boy! in 1938. Between films she continued her stage career, including a starring role in Life Begins at Oxford Circus at the London Palladium. Lawson appeared in a number of theatrical productions up through the first year of the Second World War. In late 1939 Lawson participated in a series of shows for the benefit of the British military personnel. The last production that Lawson had a role in was White Horse Inn at the Coliseum Theatre in early 1940.  Romances and marriage  Lawson was as known for her off stage romances as she was for her onstage performances. In 1933 her engagement to Maurice Henry van Raalte, heir to a cigar importing fortune, ended tragically with her fianc√©'s sudden death. In May 1934 Lawson announced she was to marry a Mr H Glendenning, a cameraman on the set of Money in the Air, a film in which Lawson had a part and that was eventually distributed as Radio Pirates. But only a few months later in August 1934 Lawson caused a national sensation when it was announced that she was engaged to Fred Perry, the world's premier tennis player and winner of numerous Grand Slam tournaments. The couple first met when Perry visited the London studies of the film Falling in Love, in which Lawson played the role of Ann Brent. Perry later escorted Lawson to an exhibition match at Highbury Fields and proposed marriage before he departed to New York City to defend his US Open title. The couple's engagement became a news sensation, which took a toll on their relationship. When Perry turned down an offer of $50,000 to turn pro, he reportedly said it was because he would face tax issues and jeopardise his relationship with Lawson. In April 1935, while Perry was in the United States, the engagement was called off. Lawson reportedly stated that she broke off the engagement because publicity killed their romance, she had tired of the ridiculous rumours that had circulated in the media and she was opposed to Perry's plans to live permanently in America. Map of Guernsey. Lawson met her future husband Francis William Lionel Collings Beaumont while filming the 1936 film Toilers of the Sea, a film adaption of Victor Hugo's 1866 novel Les Travailleurs de la mer. Hugo's book is set in the British Crown Dependency Guernsey in the English Channel off the coast of Normandy, which includes the island of Sark, a feudal territory ruled by the Seigneur of Sark. Beaumont's mother, Dame Sibyl Mary Collings Beaumont Hathaway, who was the ruling 21st Seigneur of Sark, wrote in her autobiography that the scenes from the film were shot on Sark and that her son provided backing for the film, along with French director/producer Jean Choux;Hathaway incorrectly writes that the film was shot in 1938. in the film credits the production company L. C. Beaumont is mentioned, but not Choux. At this time Beaumont was married and had a son, the future 22nd Seigneur of Sark. It is uncertain when the affair between Lawson and Beaumont began, but Beaumont's wife purchased an announcement in the edition of 30 November 1937 of The Times asking for a \\"dissolution\\" of their marriage \\"on the ground of his adultery with Miss Mary Lawson.\\" That year the Beaumonts were divorced,Catalogue description for Document No. J 77/3752/4301. Divorce Court File: 4301. Appellant: Enid Corinne Beaumont. Respondent: Francis William Lionel C Beaumont. Type: Wife's petition for divorce [wd] 1937\\\\. The National Archives, Kew and on 22 June 1938 Beumont and Lawson were married in Chelsea. In her memoirs, Hathaway makes no mention of her son's second wife, rather she praises his first wife as a \\"charming girl\\" and states that \\"on account of behaviour of my sons ‚Ä¶ there have been many heartbreaking blows.\\" Upon marriage Lawson legally changed her name to Mary Elizabeth Beaumont, but she continued to use Mary Lawson as her stage name.  Death  When the Second World War broke out Sark was occupied by the German military and Beaumont joined the Royal Air Force, reaching the rank of flight lieutenant. In May 1941 Flt Lt Beaumont received a week's leave and he, Lawson, friends and family travelled to Liverpool, where according to Hathaway they stayed at a hotel at 126 Smithdown Road in the Sefton Park district. This, however, is unlikely as 126 Smithdown Road was the address for Smithdown Road Infirmary (later Sefton General Hospital) and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission information suggests they were staying at 74 Bedford Street in Toxteth. On 1 May the German Luftwaffe began a bombing campaign on Liverpool that lasted for more than a week. On 4 May as the warning sirens went off, family and friends at the home, including Lawson's sister Dorothy, took safety in a shelter, while Lawson and Beaumont stayed in their room. The home was destroyed, killing the couple, while all those who sought safety in the shelter survived. Lawson's death was announced in newspapers around the globe, but was overshadowed by the greater destruction of the war. Both Lawson and her husband are buried in Kirkdale Cemetery, Liverpool.

Roland Jazz Chorus is the name given to a series of solid-state instrument amplifiers produced by the Roland Corporation in Japan since 1975. Its name comes from its built-in analog chorus effect. The Jazz Chorus series became increasingly popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s new wave and post-punk scenes because of its clean yet powerful sound, durability and relatively low cost when compared to the more commonly used tube amplifiers of the time such as Marshall or Fender. It also found favour amongst funk players in America. It also became popular to use for clean tones in heavy metal, with the most famous users being James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett from Metallica, and Wes Borland from Limp Bizkit. Most models have controls based on the JC-120's standard setup. There are two channels, one clean, the other with effects. The built-in effects include stereo chorus, vibrato, reverb, and distortion. The amplifier features high and low inputs, a bright switch as well as a three band equalizer and volume for each channel.

Biography  Rivas Mercado was born as the second of four children (Alicia; Antonieta; Mario and Amelia) of the notable architect Antonio Rivas Mercado and his wife Cristina Matilde Castellanos Haff.Lilia Peralta: Antonieta Rivas Mercado (1900-1931) (Spanish), University of Arizona, October 20, 2008. Around 1910, during the Mexican revolution, her parents separated, and her mother moved together with Antonieta's older sister Alice to Paris, where they stayed until their return to Mexico in 1915. Antonio Rivas Mercado refused to let his wife move back into the family's house, as a result of which Antonieta had to assume more responsibility at home. With her father's permission, at the age of 18, she married British-born, American-raised engineer Albert Edward Blair, and gave birth to their son Donald Antonio (Tonito) on September 9, 1919.Darlene Harbou Unrue: Antonieta Rivas Mercado: Katherine Anne Porter's horror and inspiration., December 22, 2005. (Tonito married the writer Kathryn Skidmore Blair in 1961.) During the time the young family lived in a ranch in the state of Durango, there were periods when Antonieta Rivas sought separation from Blair, but he did not consent, as a result of which she was sometimes depressed. She eventually moved to Mexico City and tried to file for divorce, and to obtain support for her son. In 1927, her father died, and Antonieta became responsible for the care of her parents' house and her siblings. She financed and promoted cultural projects of considerable relevance; for example, she financed and became principally involved in the foundation of the Teatro Ulises, that broke with commercial theater in the Mexico of the time. Thanks to her encouragement, literary lounges were formed, and the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica of Mexico City was formed. It was said that knowing Antonieta Rivas Mercado helped open the cultural doors in Mexico. Rivas Mercado wrote for the magazine Los Contempor√°neos and the Spanish periodical El Sol. She fell hopelessly in love with her friend, the painter Manuel Rodr√≠guez Lozano, an affection that was not reciprocated.Alejandra Salazar Salazar: Antonieta (Spanish). In 1929, she had an affair with the politician Jos√© Vasconcelos, and later supported his electoral campaign. However, this love affair also proved to be fruitless, since Vasconcelos was married. In 1931, Antonieta followed Vasconcelos to Paris and, when rejected, shot herself at the altar of Notre Dame de Paris. Cultural depictions In 1982, the story of her life was set to film in Antonieta, by Spanish director Carlos Saura and will be set to a Mexican telenovela in A la luz del √°ngel, by producer Carla Estrada. In November 2010 to celebrate the bicentennial of the Mexican Revolution, the opera Antonieta by Mexican composer Federico Ibarra, was presented at the Teatro Flores Canelo, Centro Nacional de las Artes in Mexico City. Mexican mezzo-soprano Lidya Rend√≥n starred as Antonieta, in a staging by Antonio Morales and Rosa Blanes Rex, conducted by Enrique Barrios.

Gameplay Xenomorph is a science-fiction role-playing video game, viewed from a first-person perspective with an icon- driven interface that drew comparisons with Dungeon Master. The storyline is influenced by the early Alien franchise. The player controls a janitor on a two-year supply run to Sirius who wakes from cryosleep after traversing hyperspace (the big empty) to find his ship, the Mombassa Oak, has been crippled on arrival at its destination (part of it remaining in hyperspace) leaving the ship's computer system failing. The janitor manually pilots the failing ship to the mining platform, Astargatis, to find that the human population has vanished. The player must search the platform for microchips and fuel rods that can be used to repair the Mombassa Oak. In addition, the player must defend himself against the aliens that are responsible for the attack on Astargatis. The player needs to manage weapons, medical supplies, keycard access, food, energy, and radiation levels in order to survive. Reception Xenomorph was critically well received. Computer & Video Games highlighted the well-drawn aliens and scenery, addictiveness, and atmosphere of solitude. Some jerky animation was criticised, but overall the Amiga and Atari versions were awarded 90%. Amiga Format awarded 83%, finding the 3D view to be well implemented, and the weapons and equipment to be varied, well- designed and graphically impressive. The lack of a wide variety of sound effects was criticized, as was the lack of an \\"outer-space\\" atmosphere. Critics pointed out that drawing a map is important in progressing in Xenomorph, as it is easy to get lost or miss an important location. Legacy A sequel to Xenomorph titled Xenomorph II was announced in a February 1991 issue of The One, and was to be developed by the development team behind Into the Eagle's Nest, however, the game was never released and is in dispute. According to rumourXenomorph II was to use Into the Eagle's Nest as a framework, but upgraded with \\"the Xenomorph 3D system\\", and was announced for a February 1992 release. However one of the original authors of Xenomorph denies this was ever proposed and had other plans for a sequel. http://www.terrygreer.com/xenomorph.html References External links * *An account by the game's designer/artist on the game's creation.

Indiana University Press, Toumanoff, Cyril (1967). Studies in Christian Caucasian History, pp. 490-493. Georgetown University Press. The numbering of successive rulers in the early Bagratid period is very confused in that it moves between the different branches of the family. Hence, Adarnase, known as ‚ÄúIV‚Äù for being the fourth Adarnase as the prince of Iberia, is also known as ‚ÄúII‚Äù as a sovereign of Tao-Klarjeti and ‚ÄúI‚Äù as the king of Iberia.  Dynastic strife  Adarnase was the only son of David I, the prince of Iberia with the Byzantine title of curopalates, who was murdered by his cousin Nasra in 881. As Adarnase was still a minor, the Byzantine emperor ‚Äì pursuant to the policy of division ‚Äì appointed as curopalates, not Adarnase, but his cousin Gurgen. Nasra‚Äôs subsequent attempt to dispossess Adarnase of patrimonial inheritance was defeated with the help of the Armenian king Ashot I in 888. The victory allowed Adarnase to claim a royal status for him. The historian Valeri Silogava has surmised that Adarnase's crowning as king might have occurred, in a symbolic move, at the ancient Iberian capital of Mtskheta, as suggested by an asomtavruli inscription‚Äîprobably a 17th-century reinstatement of an earlier epigraph‚Äîat the Samtavro Monastery. Allied with the resurgent Armenians, Adarnase then launched, from his base in Lower Tao, a policy of expansion. Not being a curopalates and having Armenia's example before him, Adarnase assumed the title of king and subsequently defeated his rival curopalates Gurgen. The Byzantine government adapted itself to the circumstances and, upon Gurgen death in 891, recognized Adarnase as curopalates.  Switching alliances  Adarnase rewarded Ashot of Armenia‚Äôs assistance with steadfast loyalty which continued into the reign of Ashot‚Äôs successor Smbat I whom Adarnase aided to win the crown in dynastic struggles in 890 and later joined him against Ahmed ibn-'Is√¢ of Diyarbakƒ±r, the Caliph‚Äôs former governor of Armƒ´niya. In turn, Smbat recognized Adarnase‚Äôs royal status and personally crowned him in 899. The two men collaborated in defeating, in 904, the Abkhazian king Constantine III, their common relative, who competed with Adarnase for hegemony in Inner Iberia (Duchy of Kartli) and with Smbat in Gogarene (Tashir-Dzoraget). Adarnase captured Constantine and turned him over to Smbat. But the latter, inclined to balance Adarnase‚Äôs growing power and extend Armenian influence to west Georgia, freed his captive. This move turned Adarnase against Smbat and the ensuing break and enmity weakened the both monarchs: Adarnase was dispossessed by Constantine. Viceroy of Kartli in 904, while Smbat was defeated and tortured to death by Yusuf, a Sajid ruler of Azerbaijan in 914. As a result of these events, Adarnase was relegated to his portion of the Bagratid hereditary lands in Tao. He rebuilt the church of Bana in Tao and made it a bishop's seat.Thomson, Robert W.

The eldest son and ultimate successor of Adarnase IV of Iberia as king of Iberia, David's control was limited to the duchies of Queli-Javakheti, and Lower Tao as the core lands of Inner Iberia (Shida Kartli) were under the Abkhazian control. In spite of his royal title and unlike his father, David did not bear the traditional high Byzantine title of curopalates which was bestowed by the emperor upon David's younger brother Ashot II. As a result, David's influence and prestige were overshadowed by those of his younger brother, Ashot II. As evidenced by Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De Administrando Imperio, David only had the title of magistros which he shared with his relative Gurgen II of Tao. Both Gurgen and David resolutely opposed the Byzantine takeover of the Bagratid town of Artanuji, a fief of Gurgen's father-in-law, Ashot the Swift. During the dispute, David even arrested the Byzantine plenipotentiary, the patrikios Constans, who was dispatched to create Gurgen magistros and bring David's brother Ashot for investiture as curopalates.

Although the capture of Cambrai was achieved significantly quicker than expected and with moderately low casualties, German resistance northeast of the town stiffened. By 11 October, the Fourth Army had closed up on the retreating Germans near Le Cateau, with the Germans taking up a new position, immediately to the east of the Selle River. General Henry Rawlinson was faced with three problems: crossing the river, the railway embankment on the far side and the ridge above the embankment. The decision was made to commence the assault at night and as the river was not very wide at this point, planks would be used for the soldiers to cross in single file. Later, pontoons would be required for the artillery to cross the river. Field Marshal Douglas Haig, aware that the Germans were near exhaustion, initiated a series of operations designed to get British troops in strength across the river and clear a way for a move against the Sambre‚ÄìOise Canal, a further to the east. Battle After a six-day halt for preparations and artillery bombardments Fourth Army troops attacked at 5.20 a.m. on Thursday 17 October. Infantry and tanks, preceded by a creeping barrage, moved forward on a front south of Le Cateau. The centre and left of the Fourth Army forced crossings of the river, despite unexpectedly strong German resistance and much uncut barbed wire. Fighting was particularly fierce along the line of the Le Cateau‚ÄìWassigny railway. The right of the attack, across the upland watershed of the Selle, made most progress and by nightfall the German defences had been broken and Le Cateau captured. Fighting continued from 18‚Äì19 October, by which time Fourth Army, much assisted by the French First Army on its right, advanced over , harrying the Germans back towards the Sambre‚ÄìOise Canal. The British Third and First Armies, north of the Fourth Army, maintained the offensive pressure the following day. In a surprise joint night attack in the early morning of 20 October, Third Army formations secured the high ground east of the Selle. Following a two-day pause, to bring up heavy artillery, the attack was renewed on 23 October with a major combined assault by Fourth, Third and First Armies; the fighting, which continued into the next day, resulted in further advances. At this stage, the German Army was retreating at a forced but controlled pace. On 24 October, the German Army counterattacked at the Canal de la D√©rivation but were repulsed and pushed back by the Belgian Army. Aftermath Lt. Frederick William Hedges was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle. On 26 October, Erich Ludendorff, First Quartermaster General of the German army, resigned under pressure from Kaiser Wilhelm II.

It was briefly active between 1 January and 1 November 1960, assigned to the 33d Air Division at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The sector was responsible for the air defense of New Mexico and most of Texas, and was inactivated as a result of a shift towards ballistic missile defense. History The Albuquerque Air Defense Sector was activated on 1 January 1960 as a manual sector, lacking a SAGE Computer, at Kirtland Air Force Base (AFB), assigned to the simultaneously redesignated 33rd Air Division (SAGE); it replaced the 34th Air Division (Defense), inactivated on the same date. 34th Air Division commander Colonel Lewis W. Stocking took command of the sector, leading it until September. The mission of the AADS was to provide air defense for New Mexico, most of Texas, southern Colorado, and the Oklahoma Panhandle. The organization provided command and control over three fighter-interceptor squadrons: the 58th at Walker AFB, the 93d at Kirtland, and the 331st at Webb AFB; as well as nine aircraft control and warning squadrons: the 683d, 685th, 686th, 687th, 688th, 697th, 732d, 768th, and 769th, which operated radar stations in New Mexico and Texas. The sector operated Manual Air-Defense Control Center (ADCC) (P-41), inherited from the 34th Air Division. A SAGE Direction Center was planned but never built. On 1 November 1960 the Albuquerque ADS was inactivated without gaining operational status when ADC ended command and control operations at Kirtland, part of a reorganization of Air Defense Command against the new ballistic missile threat. The organizations under AADS were inactivated or transferred to the Oklahoma City Air Defense Sector before its inactivation, on 15 September. The 58th and 331st Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons were transferred to the Oklahoma City Air Defense Sector, along with all of the Aircraft Control and Warning Squadrons. The 260 AADS headquarters personnel were also moved to Oklahoma City. The 93d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron had been inactivated on 8 July as its North American F-86 Sabre fighters were phased out. =Lineage= * Established as Albuquerque Air Defense Sector on 1 January 1960 : Inactivated on 1 November 1960 =Assignments= * 33d Air Division, 1 January 1960 ‚Äì 1 November 1960 =Stations= * Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, 1 January 1960 ‚Äì 1 November 1960 =Components=  Interceptor squadrons * 58th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron : Walker AFB, New Mexico, 1 January ‚Äì 15 September 1960 * 93d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron : Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, 1 January ‚Äì 8 July 1960 * 331st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron : Webb AFB, Texas, 1 January ‚Äì 15 September 1960 Radar squadrons * 683d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron : Sweetwater AFS, Texas, 1 January ‚Äì 15 September 1960 * 685th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron : Las Cruces AFS, New Mexico, 1 January ‚Äì 15 September 1960 * 686th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron : Walker AFB, New Mexico, 1 January ‚Äì 15 September 1960 * 687th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron : West Mesa AFS, New Mexico, 1 January ‚Äì 15 September 1960 * 688th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron : Amarillo AFB, Texas, 1 January ‚Äì 15 September 1960 * 697th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron : Pyote AFS, Texas, 1 January ‚Äì 15 September 1960 * 732d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron : Ozona AFS, Texas, 1 January ‚Äì 15 September 1960 * 768th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron : Moriarty AFS, New Mexico, 1 January ‚Äì 15 September 1960 * 769th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron : Continental Divide AFS, New Mexico, 1 January ‚Äì 15 September 1960 See also * List of USAF Aerospace Defense Command General Surveillance Radar Stations * Aerospace Defense Command Fighter Squadrons References = Citations = = Bibliography = Air Defense Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1960 ","title":"Albuquerque Air Defense Sector"},{"id":"23082927","text":"Matrilineality in Judaism or matrilineal descent in Judaism is the tracing of Jewish descent through the maternal line. Jewish communities have practiced matrilineal descent from at least early Tannaitic (c. 10-70 CE) times to Modern times.Reviewed by Louis Jacobs, Originally published in Judaism 34.1 (Winter 1985), 55-59. The origins and date-of-origin of matrilineal descent in Judaism are uncertain. Orthodox Jews, who believe that matrilineality and matriarchy within Judaism are related to the metaphysical concept of the Jewish soul, Also, from the perspective of classical Jewish belief, the primary identity of all people follows the mother. Genesis 20:12, Rashi. maintain that matrilineal descent is an oral law from at least the time of the covenant at Sinai (c. 1310 BCE). Conservative Jewish Theologian Rabbi Louis Jacobs suggests that the marriage practices of the Jewish community were re- stated as a law of matrilineal descent in the early Tannaitic Period (c. 10-70 CE). Scholarly view on origin of matrilineality in Judaism See below under \\"Conservative Jewish beliefs and practices\\" for a minimum. Contemporary practice of Jews The practice of matrilineal descent differs by denomination. Orthodox Judaism practices matrilineal descent and considers it axiomatic.see Rabbi Moses Feinstein‚Äôs re-affirmation of matrilineal descent, Elberg, Rabbi S., September, 1984, HaPardes Rabbinical Journal, Hebrew, vol.59, Is.1, p. 21.Torat Menachem, Hitvaduyot, 5745, vol. 1, pages 133-136 The Conservative Jewish Movement also practices matrilineal descent. In 1986, the Conservative Movement's Rabbinical Assembly reiterated the commitment of the Conservative Movement to the practice of matrilineal descent.https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/assets/public/halakhah/teshuvot/20012004/31.pdf In 1983, the Central Conference of American Rabbis of Reform Judaism passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent, provided that either (a) one is raised as a Jew, by Reform standards, or (b) one engages in an appropriate act of public identification, formalizing a practice that had been common in Reform synagogues for at least a generation. This 1983 resolution departed from the Reform Movement's previous position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother.Reform Movement's Resolution on Patrilineal Descent However, the closely associated Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism has rejected this resolution and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother.Reform Judaism in Israel: Progress and Prospects Karaite Judaism does not accept Jewish Oral Law as definitive, believing that all divine commandments were recorded with their plain meaning in the written Torah. As such, they interpret the Hebrew Bible to indicate that Jewishness can only follow patrilineal descent. In 1968, the Reconstructionist movement became the first American Jewish movement to pass a resolution recognizing Jews of patrilineal descent. Each of the denominations of Judaism has protocols for conversion for those who are not Jewish by birth. Biblical sources and their classical Jewish interpretations =The Patriarchs and Matriarchs= The Book of Genesis describes the family of patriarchs and matriarchs who are the traditional ancestors of the Jewish people. Genesis describes three patriarchs of Israel: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and the four matriarchs of Israel: Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah. Cave of the Machpelah, believed to be the burial place of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah. The Tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem. photo c. 1933 Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah were all family of Abraham. In the Jewish tradition, Bilhah and Zilpah were as well.Gen. Rabbati, Vayeze, p. 119; Yalkut Shimoni, Vayetze- Remez 125. Sarah came from the same family as Abraham. According to Jewish tradition, Sarah was Abraham's niece, whose name is given elsewhere in Genesis as Iscah.Sanhedrin 69b Abraham fathered children with three wives or concubines: Sarah, Hagar, and Keturah.Genesis 16:3,15, 25:1,2 The Jewish people (according to Genesis) is descended from Isaac (son of Sarah), but not from any of the sons of Abraham's other wives. In God refers to Hagar's son as \\"the son of the maidservant\\" rather than \\"your [Avraham's] son\\"; later rabbinic sources deduce from this that a Jewish man's child is considered \\"his\\" child only if the mother is Jewish.Tanchuma, Hukat, 6 Isaac married Rebekah, who came from the same family as Abraham.Genesis 24:10 Rebekah was Abraham's great niece through his brother, Nahor, and his great-great niece through Milcah, daughter of his brother, Haran.Genesis 11:29 ; Genesis 22:20-23. Also, Genesis 22:23 Rashi that this whole genealogy was written just for Rebekah. They had Jacob and Esau. Esau, Jacob's fraternal twin married two Hittite women (neither from the family of Abraham),Genesis 26:34,35 and a third woman was from the family of Ishmael.Genesis 28:9 Esau's offspring, the Edomites,Genesis 36: 1, 8, 9, 19, 43 were considered non-Jewish. Jacob, Isaac's other son, was married to Leah and Rachel,Genesis 29:22-26,28,29 who were Jacob's first cousins.Genesis 29:10,12 Rachel and Leah were both Abraham's great-great nieces and his great-great-great nieces. According to Jewish tradition, Bilhah and Zilpah, handmaidens of Rachel and Leah and the birth-mothers of four of the tribes, were Rachel and Leah's half-sisters. They had the same father as Rachel and Leah, but not the same mother.Gen. Rabbati, Vayetze, p. 119; Yalkut Shimoni Vayetze- remez 125; Targum Yonasan Gen. 29:24,29; Pirkei D'Rabi Eliezer chapt. 36 The Jewish People see themselves as descending from the three founding families of Israel.Based on Jewish scripture and oral tradition. The Matriarchs of Israel are the mothers of the Tribes of Israel; for those who adhere to Jewish Law, Israelite Nationhood or belonging to the Jewish People via descent exclusively follows the mother's line.; Gen. Raba 7, Rashi: Mishpachat Av Keruya Mishpacha ‚Ä¶ en mishpachat av keruya mishpacha ‚Ä¶ The Torah has been interpreted to suggest that a brother and sister from the same mother are more closely related than a brother and sister from just the same father (Genesis 20:12 Rashi). =Moses= Moses married Zipporah, daughter of Jethro, Priest of Midian. They had two sons, Gershom and Eliezer,Exodus 18:1-10 both born before the Exodus. The sons of Moses are absent from the genealogy of Levi in Exodus.Exodus 6:16-27 also, Numbers 3:1-4, Numbers 26:58-61 Moses married a Cushite woman (who, according to classical interpretations, may or may not refer to Zipporah).Numbers 12:1 commentaries ad loc The Torah makes no mention of any offspring from this union. The priesthood in Israel descends from Aaron, brother of Moses.Ex. 40:15 =Samson= Samson, from the tribe of Dan served as Judge of Israel for twenty years.Judges 13:25, 15:20 The reaction of Samson's parents to his desired marriage to a Philistine woman may indicate the cultural expectations in Israel regarding marriage at this time: > And his father and his mother said to him, ‚ÄúIs there no woman among the > daughters of your brothers and among all of my people that you should go to > take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?‚Äù‚Ä¶ Judges 14:3 In the account of the Book of Judges, Samson married this woman and soon killed thirty Philistine men in Ashkelon.Judges 14 (Samson's wife was then given to another man by her father who said that Samson utterly hated her.Judges 15: 2 Samson then set the fields of the Philistines on fire.Judges 15:3-5 The Philistines then went and killed this woman and her father.Judges 15: 6) =Ruth the Moabitess and Naamah the Ammonitess= In the accounts of the Prophets and Writings (which covers a time period of nearly a millennium) there are two cases of non-Israelite women who voluntarily (not resulting from conflict) married Israelites where their children were considered Israelite. According to the Talmud, both of these women, Ruth and Naamah, formally converted.Yevamoth 77a, 47b Ruth came from the people of Moab, who descend from the older daughter of Lot.Genesis 19:37 (Lot was the son of Haran and the nephew of Abraham).Genesis 11: 27, 31; Genesis 14: 12 In the Book of Ruth, Naomi was the wife of Elimelech of Bethlehem, Judah. Due to famine in the land, Elimelech went with his family to live in Moab and then died.Ruth 1: 3 Naomi's two sons married Moabite women, named Ruth and Orpah.Ruth 4:10 Naomi's two sons then died.Ruth 1:1-5 In a state of poverty and accompanied by her former daughter-in-law, Ruth the Moabitess,Ruth 1:22 Naomi journeyed back to Bethlehem, Judah.Ruth 1: 19 Then in selling her late husband's land in Judah and the estates of her sons, Naomi set up the stipulation that her financial redeemer also marry her former daughter-in-law.Ruth 3:1-5, 4:3,9 The first potential redeemer declined, lest this [marriage] ruin his inheritance.Ruth 4:6 Boaz, the next of kin, became Naomi's redeemer, married Ruth and became the father of Obed.Ruth 4:13,18-22 > And Naomi took the child and placed him in her bosom, and she became his > nurse.Ruth 4:16 And the women neighbors gave him a name, saying, \\"A son has > been born to Naomi,\\" and they called his name Obed- he is the father of > Jesse, the father of David.Ruth 4:17 Naamah,Naamah is noted favorably by the Talmud, Bava Kama 38b. See http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11254-naamah that Naamah was the granddaughter of Nahash, a king of Ammon. came from the people of Ammon who descend from the younger daughter of Lot.Genesis 19:38 Naamah married Solomon; their son Rehoboam was a Judean king of the Davidic Line.Kings I, 14:21, 31 Solomon loved many foreign women,The Prophets describe how Solomon's foreign wives not only did not follow the Israelite beliefs of their husband, King Solomon, (I Kings 11:8) but instead they drew King Solomon away from a wholehearted belief in the God of Israel (I Kings 11:1-4) none of whom are mentioned by name in Jewish scripture other than Naamah.see I Kings Chapter 11, I Kings 14:21, 14:31; II Chronicles 12:13 Rehoboam is the only son of Solomon recorded in all Jewish scripture.I Kings 11:43, 14:21-31; II Chronicles 9:31-12:16 (Two daughters, Tafat bat-Shlomo and Basmat bat-Shlomo, are also mentioned.) I Kings 4:11,15 =Ezra= The Jerusalem Talmud (c 400 CE) cites from the Book of Ezra (Ezra 10:3) as evidence of the law of matrilineal descent in Judaism.Jerusalem Talmud, Yebamot 2:6; Ezra 10:3 Rashi In the book of Ezra, Ezra the Scribe, (c 400 BCE) http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5968-ezra-book-of returned to Judea from the Babylonian Exile with more than forty thousand Israelites to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem.Ezra 2:64; Nehemiah 7:66 Many of them had intermarried with non-Jewish women and tells the story of their renunciation of intermarriage and separation from the non-Jewish wives and from their children. The necessity of separating from the children as well as the wives suggests that the children were not considered Jewish despite having Jewish fathers. =Tamar, daughter of King David= The medieval French commentator, Rashi (1040-1105 CE) in his commentary on Prophets references the law of matrilineal descent regarding Tamar, daughter of King David.II Samuel 13:13, Rashi In the biblical account, Tamar attempted to persuade her half-brother Amnon not to rape her, by suggesting that he could legitimately marry her instead.II Samuel 13:13 Although they were half siblings biologically, by law they were not related. Tamar's mother (at least at the time when she was conceived) was not Israelite, her mother was Maacah, daughter of Talmai king of Geshur.II Samuel 3:3, II Samuel 13:1 According to what Tamar claimed in the record of Prophets, the law would disregard the biological fact that they shared a father. References from Hellenistic histories The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher, Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 BCE ‚Äì 50 CE) calls the child of a Jew and a non-Jew a nothos (bastard), regardless of whether the non-Jewish parent is the father or the mother.On the Life of Moses 2.36.193, On the Virtues 40.224, On the Life of Moses 1.27.147 Flavius Josephus (c. 37-100 CE), the Romanized Jewish historian, writing about events that were alleged to have occurred a century prior, has Antigonus II Mattathias (c. 63-37 BCE), the last Hasmonean king of Judea, denigrating Herod ‚Äìwhose father's family were Idumean Arabs forcibly converted to Judaism by John Hyrcanus (c. 134-104 BCE)Josephus, Antiquities, 13.9.1. and whose mother, according to Josephus, was either an Idumean ArabJosephus, Antiquities, 14.7.3. or Arabian (Nabatean-Arab)Josephus, Wars, 1.8.9.‚Äì by referring to him as \\"an Idumean i.e. a half-Jew\\" and as therefore unfit to be given governorship of Judea by the Romans: > But Antigonus, by way of reply to what Herod had caused to be proclaimed, > and this before the Romans‚Ä¶said that they [the Romans] would not do justly, > if they gave the kingdom to Herod, who was no more than a private man, and > an Idumean, i.e. a half Jew, whereas they ought to bestow it on one of the > royal family, as their custom was; for that in case they at present bear an > ill-will to him [to Antigonus], and had resolved to deprive him of the > kingdom, as having received it from the Parthians, yet were there many > others of his family [the Hasmoneans] that might by their law take it, and > these such as had no way offended the Romans; and being of the sacerdotal > family [the Hasmoneans], it would be an unworthy thing to put them > by.Josephus, Antiquities, 14.15.2. Beliefs and practices =Orthodox Jewish beliefs and practices= Orthodox Judaism maintains that the law of matrilineal descent in Judaism dates at least to the time of the covenant at Sinai (c. 1310 BCE). This law was first codified in writing in the Mishna (c. 2nd century CE).Yebamot 2:5; Kidushin 3:12 The Jewish oral tradition adduces the law of matrilineal descent from Deuteronomy, as explained by R. Yohanan in the Talmud:Commentary of Yom Tov Asevilli on Babylonian Talmud (Kiddushin 68b), based on Deuteronomy 7:3-4 ‚Äúyou shall not intermarry with them: you shall not give your daughter to his son, and you shall not take his daughter for your son. For he will turn away your son from following Me, and they will worship the gods of others‚Ä¶‚Äù Rabbi Yom Tov Asevilli breaks down the verse, by looking very closely and diacritically at the wording of the text: \\"...since he (the gentile father) will turn away your son (i.e. the child born to your Jewish daughter) from following me.\\" Here, it is implied that God still reckons the child to be Jewish by calling him your son - even though such unions were forbidden., s.v. Kiddushin 68b The text calls him your son, implying that he is still an Israelite because he was born from a Jewish mother. However, the opposite is not true. The Torah does not say, \\"...for she (the gentile mother) will turn away your son.\\" In this case, the child would no longer be considered your son, but rather a gentile.Cf. Babylonian Talmud (Yebamot 17a; Kiddushin 68b); Numbers Rabba 19:3 The Talmud (Yebamot 17a) then brings down an opinion which said that a child born from an Israelite mother and a non-Jewish father is something of an anomaly worthy of censure, and that the child is a non-Jew, based on a verse in the 5th chapter of Hosea: ‚ÄúThey have betrayed Hashem, for they have begotten strange children.‚Äù According to Maimonides in his Code of Jewish law,Maimonides, Mishne Torah (Hil. Issurei Bi'ah 12:1-2) the prohibition of marrying the Canaanites in Deuteronomy 7:3 refers not only to the seven nations of Canaan, but also to all other gentiles. Dr. Immanuel Jakobovits, who served as Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of England from 1967 to 1991, offers a possible reason for this law: ‚Äú‚Ä¶the certainty of maternity must be set against the doubt of paternity, however small this doubt may be. In such cases Jewish law invariably invokes the rule ‚Äúa doubt can never over-rule a certainty‚Äù. Jakobovits also suggests a connection between the Jewish law of matrilineal descent and a mother's bond with her child. Jakobovits writes: ‚ÄúIt was Eve who was called so ‚Äúbecause she was the mother of all living‚Äù (Gen. 3:20), whereas Adam was not named as ‚Äúthe father of all life‚Äù. Jakobovits adds, ‚Äúthe determination of the child‚Äôs religious status by the mother may also indicate that she has the superior influence on the child‚Äôs religious development.‚Äù Also, Grunfeld, Isidor, and Samson Raphael Hirsch. Judaism Eternal: Selected Essays from the Writings of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch. Vol. 1, Soncino Press, 1976. P. 224-225 Orthodox Jewish practices Orthodox Judaism follows matrilineal descent and holds that anyone with a Jewish mother also has irrevocable Jewish status; that even were such a Jew to convert to another religion, that person would still be considered Jewish by Jewish Law. =Conservative Jewish beliefs and practices= Rabbi Louis Jacobs, who was the founder of the Masorti (Conservative) Jewish Movement in Britain and a well-known theologian writes regarding his review of an article by Professor Cohen on matrilineal descent in Judaism: > There has been a development of the law in these instances from Biblical and > pre-Rabbinic times. The attempt to find reasons for the change, however, has > proved to be elusive and is quite unnecessary since it can be explained > entirely economically by the logic of the law itself and is typical of > Rabbinic thinking in general.

With the > exception of the Rabbi in the Jerusalem Talmud (Qiddushin, 3:12) who > permitted the child of a gentile mother and Jewish father to be circumcised > on the Sabbath and whose opinion was vehemently rejected, the law is > accepted unanimously in both Talmuds.

Cohen of Harvard University and formerly a Dean at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City, questions the date of origin of matrilineal descent: > The preexilic portions of the Hebrew Bible are not familiar with the > matrilineal principle. Numerous Israelite heroes and kings married foreign > women; for example, Judah married a Canaanite, Joseph an Egyptian, Moses a > Midianite and an Ethiopian, David a Philistine, and Solomon women of every > description.

Cohen, AJS Review, V. > 10.1, 1985, 19-53 In his review of Cohen's article, Rabbi Jacobs accepts that the law may have changed in the early Tannaitic period (circa 10-70 CE): \\"From the historical evidence marshalled by Professor Cohen it would appear that the change from the patrilineal to the matrilineal principle for the offspring of mixed unions of Jew and gentile took place in the early Tannaitic period.\\" But Jacobs dismisses Cohen's suggestion that \\"the Tannaim were influenced by the RomanIn Roman law, without connubium, the right to contract a legal marriage according to Roman Law (i.e. where both parties are Roman citizens and where both parties gave consent), the marriage was not a justum matrimonium, a legal Roman marriage and the children from such a union had no legal father and therefore followed the status (i.e. Roman citizenship status) of the mother. Interestingly, ‚Äú[t]hese restrictions as to marriage were not founded on any enactments; they were a part of that large mass of Roman law which belongs to Jus Moribus Constitutum [unwritten Roman law].‚Äù http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Matrimonium.html legal system...\\" and contends that \\"even if the Rabbis were familiar with the Roman law, they might have reacted to it [instead] by preserving the patrilineal principle, holding fast to their own system.\\" Instead, Jacobs offers another explanation. Jacobs believes that an Israelite man who married a non-Israelite woman and had a child, that woman and child were considered not part of the \\"family clan\\" and therefore were not considered Israelite: \\"A child born of a Jewish father and a gentile mother cannot be given the status of the father since the patrilineal principle is stated only with regard to unions within the clan. How can the father who steps out of the clan bestow a clan status on the child whom he sires?\\" Therefore, Jacobs hypothesizes: > The child of a Jewish father and a gentile mother is not a gentile because > of the application of any matrilineal principle...He is a child without > Jewish parentage since the patrilineal principle cannot operate for a union > carried out beyond the limits of the clan. The child is not a gentile > because his mother is a gentile but because the only way a child can be born > as a Jew is for him to have the Jewishness of his father transmitted to him > and this cannot happen where the union is outside of the clan limits. Thus, > for the Rabbis there is no switch here from a patrilineal to a matrilineal > principle. The patrilineal principle still stands, only it cannot operate in > this instance. The Ratner Center for the Study of Conservative Judaism conducted a survey of 1,617 members of 27 Conservative congregations in the U.S. and Canada in 1995.Cohen, Steven M. ‚ÄúChapter 1: Assessing the Vitality of Conservative Judaism in North America: Evidence from a Survey of Synagogue Members‚Äù. In Wertheimer, Jack (2000). Jews in the Center: Conservative Synagogues and Their Members. Rutgers University Press, p. 20. Steven M. Cohen who co-conducted this survey (Wertheimer, 5) notes that the sample under represents congregants from certain major metropolitan areas (the New York region being represented by only one congregation and the Toronto and Montreal regions having no representation), over represents socially upscale congregants, and under represents congregants under the age of thirty-five. (Wertheimer, 20) 69% of respondents to the Ratner Center survey agreed that they would regard personally as a Jew anyone who was raised Jewish‚Äîeven if their mother was Gentile and their father was Jewish (Wertheimer, 59). In this same survey, 29% of respondents indicated that they attended Jewish religious services twice a month or more and 13% that they engage in the study of a Jewish text once a month or more (Wertheimer, 55-57). Conservative Jewish Practices The Conservative Movement practices matrilineal descent. In 1986, the Conservative Movement's Rabbinical Assembly reiterated the commitment of the Conservative movement to the law of matrilineal descent. Furthermore, the movement stated that any rabbi who accepts the principle of patrilineal descent will be subject to expulsion from the Rabbinical Assembly. Still, the Conservative Movement affirmed that \\"sincere Jews by choice\\" should be warmly welcomed into the community and that \\"sensitivity should be shown to Jews who have intermarried and their families.\\" The Conservative movement actively reaches out to intermarried families by offering them opportunities for Jewish growth and enrichment. =Reform Judaism beliefs and practices= In 1983, the Central Conference of American Rabbis passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent who has made affirmative acts of Jewish identity. This departed from the traditional position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother. The 1983 resolution of the American Reform movement has had a mixed reception in Reform Jewish communities outside of the United States. Most notably, the Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism has rejected patrilineal descent and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother.Reform Judaism in Israel: Progress and Prospects As well, a joint Orthodox, Traditional, Conservative and Reform Bet Din formed in Denver, Colorado to promote uniform standards for conversion to Judaism was dissolved in 1983, due to that Reform resolution. However, in 2015 the majority of Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis voted in favor of a position paper proposing \\"that individuals who live a Jewish life, and who are patrilineally Jewish, can be welcomed into the Jewish community and confirmed as Jewish through an individual process.\\" Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis stated that rabbis \\"would be able to take local decisions ‚Äì ratified by the Beit Din ‚Äì confirming Jewish status.\\" Other movements within the World Union for Progressive Judaism also adopted essentially the same position. These include: Liberal Judaism in England; Progressive Judaism in Australia; one congregation in Austria; some congregations in Eastern Europe. Note that Reform Judaism in Canada and England adopts a different position, similar to that of Conservative Judaism (though there may be an accelerated conversion process for the children of Jewish fathers). =Karaite Judaism belief and practices= Karaite Judaism does not accept Jewish Oral Law as definitive, believing that all divine commandments were recorded with their plain meaning in the written Torah. As such, they interpret the Hebrew Bible to indicate that Jewishness can only follow patrilineal descent. Karaite Judaism does not accept the authoritativeness of the Talmud or Jewish Oral Law. Karaite Judaism practices The majority view in Karaite Judaism is that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descentKaraite FAQs; Congregation Or Saddiqim, Giyyurhalf-jewish.org/bibleintermarriage.htmlhalf- jewish.org/who_is_born_a_jew.html They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line.http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml Only someone who is patrilineally Jewish (someone whose father's father was Jewish) is regarded as a Jew by the Mo'e·π£et Ha·∏§akhamim, or the Karaite Council of Sages based in Israel. =Reconstructionist Judaism belief and practices= Reconstructionist Judaism, which values equity and inclusivity, was the first movement to adopt the idea of bilineal descent in 1968. According to Reconstructionist Judaism, children of one Jewish parent, of either gender, are considered Jewish if raised as Jews. =Additional notes= The State of Israel adheres to the Jewish law of matrilineal descent for matters which could affect Israeli family law.For the re-affirmation of matrilineal descent by the Chief Rabbinical Board of the State of Israel see Elberg, Rabbi S., September, 1984, HaPardes Rabbinical Journal, Hebrew, vol.59, Is.1, p. 21. Seven marriage contracts that took place before the 13th century between Karaite and Rabbinic individuals have so far been discovered in the Cairo Genizah.https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women: > PERMISSIBILITY OF MARRIAGE ‚Ä¶Marriages with Rabbanite partners were perfectly > legal and commonly practised before the thirteenth century.

In the 12th century, approximately 25,000 Jews lived in Egypt, mostly in Cairo.https://www.bh.org.il/jewish-community-cairo/ A percentage of the Jewish community was Karaite.It is not specifically known what percentage of the 12th century Egyptian Jewish community was Karaite. As of 1906, it was estimated that there were approximately 12,000 Karaites worldwide with fewer than 2,000 estimated to possibly be in Egypt. http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9211-karaites-and-karaism. Today, there are 11 Karaite synagogues in Israel. See https://www.jweekly.com/1999/12/10/israel-s-30-000-karaites-follow-bible-not- talmud/ Moses Maimonides became one of the leaders of the Jewish community in Egypt shortly after his arrival there in 1165 CE. Jewish communities at this time including the Egyptian Jewish Community practiced matrilineal descent. In fact, Maimonides (1138-1204 CE) re-codified the law of matrilineal descent in his compilation of Jewish Law: > This is the general rule: The status of an offspring from a gentile man or > from a gentile woman is the same as his mother's; we disregard the > father.Maimonides' Mishneh Torah (c. 1170-1180 CE), Laws of Forbidden > Relationships, 15:4 The Egyptian Jewish Karaites, however, followed patrilineal descent.Yaron, Y., Joe Pessah, and Abraham Qanai. An Introduction to Karaite Judaism: History, Theology, Practice, and Culture. N.p.: Qirqisani Center, 2003. Print. Still, these same 12th century Egyptian Karaites forbade marriage with non- Jewshttps://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women > PERMISSIBILITY OF MARRIAGE In order to contract marriage, the parties must > be \\"marriageable,\\" that is: the partners must be Jewish, the woman must be > unmarried, and the parties should not fall into any of the kinship > categories prohibited by Karaite law. 1\\\\. The parties' religious affiliation > Marriages with non-Jewish partners are not acceptable for Karaites... and also did not allow converts into their community.This ban was recently lifted by the Karaite Council of Sages. In effect then, 12th century Egyptian Karaites required that both parents be Jewish, but they referred to this requirement as patrilineal descent. Marriages between Karaites and the Rabbinic community came to a halt in the thirteenth century when Maimonides ruled for a specific serious reason that there was a problem with them.https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women. In the 13th century Maimonides ruled that they fell under the classification of mamzerut. https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women: > Marriages between Karaite and Rabbanite partners came to a halt when Moses > MAIMONIDES (Rambam, 1138‚Äì1204) argued that while the Karaite marriage itself > was binding, their bill of divorce was invalid (probably because of its > formulation in Hebrew). Since the children issued from the second union of a > Karaite divorc√©e would be illegitimate (mamzerim), and since it was not > always possible to ascertain that a divorce had not occurred [sic] in > previous generations in a Karaite family, Maimonides decided to consider all > Karaites as potential mamzerim, and therefore prohibited for marriage. This ruling also means that Maimonides considered the Karaites of the 12th century Egyptian Jewish community to be Jewish on their mother's side as well. Biological justification for/against matrilineality Some matrilineal advocates have hypothesized that DNA may carry a specific genome from the mother that transmits Judaism. However, NIH researchers have sought but found no evidence that Judaism is transmitted genetically from either the mother or the father. Genetic memory, however, would suggest that the experiences of Jewish forbears are passed down to descendants across multiple generations regardless of which parent it comes from. Personal and social impacts of matrilineal tradition =Personal identity and impact of matrilineal interpretation in the United States= A 2013 Pew Research Center survey shows that American children of interfaith marriages are more likely to have been raised Jewish and identify as Jewish than in the past, which some scholars attribute to more welcoming and inclusive attitudes among Jewish organizations. The increasing awareness and social validation of self-concept as defining one's identity may also be a contributing factor. Studies have shown that American adults whose fathers are Jewish and whose mothers are not can readily identify lasting damage to their identity formation, family relations and faith due to patrilineal rejection, regardless of whether they were raised as Jews. Experiences include being singled out and made to feel unwelcome at Jewish events, sites and schools; pressure to disguise their heritage; being bullied or isolated; uncertainty regarding their personal identity; and narrowed access to a Jewish education and a community of faith. Ironically, it's not uncommon for interfaith families and their offspring rejected by matrilineal devotees to simultaneously suffer external discrimination on the basis of being Jews. In recent years organizations like 18 Doors and Building Jewish Bridges have provided opportunities for families and individuals exiled by matrilineality to connect with each other and embrace their faith. = Social impacts of matrilineal interpretation = Most interfaith couples do not adopt Judaism. Researcher Sergio DellaPergola attributes this in part to a tradition in English-speaking countries for children to adopt the mother's group identity. Progressive scholars and writers including Elana Maryles Sztokman and Jessica Fishman view matrilineality as an outdated patriarchal form of control over women's bodies not unlike Islamic subjugation of women's rights. Fishman labels matrilineality a fundamental denial of the right of personhood. See also * Who is a Jew?

The club was established on 22 February 2008 by a small group of trekking enthusiasts in Chennai, India. It started as an informal group of several friends in the computer industry and quickly grew into a 10,000+ member organization that primarily facilitates trekking as an organized sport. CTC mainly organizes 2-3 day weekend treks in and around South India. It also organizes related activities such as short treks for disadvantaged people and walks for charity, nature photography tours, one day hikes and workshops on navigation using GPS, photography, first aid and survival skills. CTC has organized more than 300 treks and more than 500 new members join each month. History 30 CTC trekkers atop 971 m. Ombattu Gudda Peak in Kabbinhole Reserved Forest, Karnataka, 15 November 2009 The Chennai Trekking Club (CTC) was started by a few trekking enthusiasts from CISCO, Thoraipakkam, Chennai a few years ago. In February 2008, after completing around 10 treks throughout South India this small group published their adventures and photos online in their blog, and allowed new people to join their group. After that, many people found them by word of mouth or on Google and joined the club. There is no membership fee. Three years later they have 10,000+ members in the club, with over 6,000 active members who have participated in at least one trek. On average over 15 new members join every day. CTC has completed over 300 treks throughout India. For their 2nd anniversary celebration on 20‚Äì21 February 2010, CTC organized 14 simultaneous treks for 444 members. For their 3rd anniversary celebration on 19‚Äì20 February 2011, CTC organized 14 simultaneous treks for 427 members. Activities CTC organizes member-led treks during weekends, and travels through mountains and wilderness areas in the Eastern Ghats and the Western Ghats. Occasionally, long treks are organized in the Himalayas. CTC's growth is attributed to a large fan base, mainly in South India, and to the volunteers who spend many hours researching and organizing the treks. It also has members from outside India, mainly expatriates who live or lived in Chennai and Bangalore and became part of CTC. In addition to providing a nice break from urban and corporate life, activities organized by CTC stimulate awareness of environmental issues and encourages physical fitness among its members. Chennai Trekking Club organizes periodic photography trips and treks especially for those members who are interested in Natural and Wildlife photography. Photography workshops for members are also conducted by experienced wildlife photographers. In addition to all these things CTC organizes social treks with unprivileged kids, tree planting and maintenance activities, lake cleanup, and beach cleanup. CTC also organises yearly trail marathons and trained hundreds of aspiring runners. Trek planning 20 members of CTC returning from peak of Ombatta Gudde in Kabbinhole Reserved Forest, Karnataka, 12 April 2009 Several core members volunteer weeks in advance to plan and organize each trek. CTC leaders are known as pathfinders. They often do not follow existing trails but trek through unexplored jungles and mountains creating their own trail using topographic maps, compass and GPS (satellite guided navigation). The leaders and volunteers of CTC organize treks every weekend. Sometimes there may be 3-4 simultaneous treks on any given weekend. Treks are planned to forests & wilderness both nearby Chennai as well as further away in the Eastern Ghats and Western Ghats in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and occasionally, North India. Levels of treks goes from easy to intermediate to difficult. The number of participants for a trek varies typically between 10 and 40. 24 CTC trekkers with loaded backpacks, departing Berijam Lake en route from Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu to Munnar, Kerala, May 2, 2009 Special interests 9 members of Chennai Trekking Club on cliff trail at Parda Point, Nagalapuram Hills, Andhra Pradesh, 19 July 2009 In addition to the regular treks, CTC organizes a variety of other events. Periodically they organize social outings for underprivileged groups in the Chennai area, including: orphans, street children lost or run away from home, destitute women, downs Syndrome kids, AIDS victims and other disadvantaged groups. CTC periodically organizes educational workshops like first aid and survival skills training, training on maps and navigation, photography workshops, climbing events and snake workshops. They also organize ladies treks, senior treks, couples treks and family treks. They periodically organize long distance multiday motorcycling trips over mountain roads and trail riding through scenic locations. CTC has programs to keep the forests clean - in addition to their no-pollution guidelines, periodic cleanup events are organized to clean up polluted natural locations. On 1 November 2009, 200+ members of CTC organized a mega cleanup trek to Tada which had become very polluted and abused over the past several years. On 9 January 2011, over 800 volunteer members collected 800 bags of garbage from of the beaches of Chennai. .  Theni Forest Fire Disaster  On 11 March 2018, a group of trekkers on their way from Kolukkumalai, trekking downhill towards Kurangani got trapped by wildfire. This group included 27 members of a 2-day trek organized by CTC to celebrate Woman‚Äôs Day and another 12 member group on a trek organized by a private tour company. 3 of the trekkers reportedly turned back before the rest faced the wildfire. Unfortunately, 16 trekkers lost their lives in the disaster. Controversies Chennai Trekking Club allowed children in the trek that met with Theni Forest Fire Disaster, but later it was revealed that there was another group of trekkers from Erode, on a trekking tour organized by a private tour company. It was this company who allowed three children in the trek. It was also reported in the media that Chennai Trekking Club had organised the trekking without proper permission or approval from the authorities. Chennai Trekking Club has disputed this claim and this is currently under investigation. Media CTC members also document landscapes and wildlife discovered during the treks. Photos are geo-tagged, published and shared on the CTC blog and the photographers' own Picassa pages. CTC has published more than 30,000 photos taken during their treks. CTC's has an extensive presence on the Internet, mostly built using Google tools. Treks and photos are published using Blogger on their blog. CTC also has online communities on Facebook. Most information regarding the group and its treks is published in their Google blog. The group maintains an active photography blog and discussion forum. Past and future treks are published on their Google Calendar and Google Maps. New treks are also announced on google groups. The club has had over 45 news stories and feature articles about the club and its activities published in the local print media including The Hindu, The Economic Times, Deccan Chronicle, Times of India, Indian Express and several Tamil Language dailies.

It is north of the city of Lezh√´ and is also known as Lezh√´-Zadrima Air Base. The Gjad√´r Airbase in Albania was built near a mountain to allow aircraft after landing to go into a tunnel under the mountain. The tunnels have a capacity of storing about 50 aircraft plus personnel. As the airfield is located in the side of the mountain, the pilots have to be careful not to turn when taking off as they can crash into the sides of the mountain. Early operations The airfield was built to minimise the threat from the Yugoslav Air Force entering Albanian airspace. To counter any Yugoslavian aircraft, the most modern aircraft, the F-7A was based here. Construction of the base began in 1969, but because of its complexity it wasn‚Äôt finished until the mid-1970s. The first aircraft to use its runway landed on 10 July 1973, and the official opening was held on 15 March 1974. Regiment 5646 was established here with one squadron of F-6s, but in May 1976 six FT-5s arrived here and also the F-7A squadron from Rinas. On 16 October 1976, a second F-6 squadron moved to the base from Ku√ßov√´. The home unit was later redesignated 4010 Regt.Aeroflight - World Air Forces, Albania, Air Force The base was in use until at least 1992 when on 9 September an FT-5 of the Albanian Air Force nearly crashed on Gjad√´r. The aircraft, piloted by Ismet Zervoi and Martin Bregu, was successfully belly-landed on the grass next to the runway without much damage. CIA operations From February to April 1994, the base was in use by the CIA to fly unmanned spy missions over Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, using two Gnat-750 pilotless drones and a ground satellite transmitting station.Sabrina P. Ramet, The three Yugoslavias: state- building and legitimation, 1918-2005 (2006) p. 454.Jeffrey Richelson, The US intelligence community (5th ed. 2008) p.192.David A. Fulghum, John D.

Because one of the original two CIA Gnats crashed during testing in the U.S., one of the two operational Gnats was leased.General Atomics Predator The operation was not a success. The Gnat-750 suffered from a number of bugs concerning the data link and was limited in use by bad weather. The team was finally withdrawn.Atomics GNAT The Gnat-750 lacked a satellite uplink antenna and so was used in conjunction with a Schweizer RG-8 powered glider as the flying data relay substitute.Steve Zaloga, Ian Palmer, Unmanned aerial vehicle: robotic air warfare 1917-2007 (2008) p. 33. The RG-8 has an 8-hour flight time, 6 of each 8 hours was spent getting to and from the relay orbit sight. While the Gnat-750 has a 24- to 30-hour endurance, the manned relay aircraft greatly limits the overall effectiveness of the system.General Atomic GNAT-750 Lofty View The RG-8 was previously used by the USCG.Tier drones - - Summary (Tier 1 ‚Äì General Atomics ‚ÄòGnat 750‚Äô) The two Gnats were then refitted with a thermal imaging sensor and an improved SIGINT package and redeployed to Croatia in 1994, achieving a significantly more effective performance. The CIA‚Äôs activities with the Gnat-750 were eventually given the code name Lofty View. In 1994, 10 initial flights were conducted, which can be marked as a failure. By the summer of 1994, the operation had conducted 30 flights of which 12 were viewed as successful.See RQ-1 Predator PDF on this site US military operations From April to November 1995 the Gjad√´r base hosted Predator UAV systems operated by the US Army's Charlie Company Military Intelligence Battalion (Low Intensity),I was there! to monitor the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Four disassembled Predators were flown into Gjad√´r airbase in a C-130 Hercules. The UAVs were assembled and flown first by civilian contract personnel. More than 70 U.S. military personnel of the military intelligence were deployed. Intelligence collection missions began in July 1995.vigil.htm Operation Nomad Vigil ‚Äì Nomad Endeavor, GlobalSecurity.org One of the Predators was lost over Bosnia on 11 August 1995; a second was deliberately destroyed on 14 August after suffering an engine failure over Bosnia, which may have been caused by hostile ground fire.Norman Polmar, The Naval Institute guide to the ships and aircraft of the U.S. fleet (2005) p. 479. Its original 60-day stay under the codename Operation Nomad Vigil was extended to 120 days. The following spring, in March 1996, the system was redeployed to the Balkan area and operated out of Taszar, Hungary.Houston R. Cantwell, RADM Thomas J. Cassidy‚Äôs MQ-1 Predator: the USAF‚Äôs first UAV success story, Air Command and Staff College Air University (Apr 2006) Aftermath On 12 March 1997, the base was stormed by local people during a national revolt against the Albanian government. Several buildings, including the control tower, were destroyed. On 16 March, soldiers abandoned the air base. Lack of funds prevented the base from being repaired, and flying operations ceased in 2000. It is now used as a storage facility for fighter aircraft withdrawn from service. No Albanian air force aircraft are permanently based there. Tunnels A feature of Gjad√´r Air Base is the mountain storage area for aircraft featuring two entrances beside the airfield buildings, accessed by a separate taxiway about 2 km long through farm fields, west of the main taxiway, dispersal, and runway complex.

The shutters were removed from the sails in 1934 and stored in the mill. The mill was bought at auction in 1937 by Mr Kenney, a mill enthusiast. The fantail was blown off in the 1940s, damaging the cap. A lease on the mill was granted to East Suffolk County Council in 1950. The council aimed to preserve an example of each main type of windmill. The derelict mill was restored from 1952 by Thomas Smithdale and Sons, the Acle, Norfolk millwrights for East Suffolk County Council. The work, costing ¬£4,000 was completed in 1954. It was part funded by the Pilgrim Trust. The wrought iron gallery round the cap was replaced with a wooden one. A new cap and fantail was built. The fantail was damaged in a gale in December 1966 and in 1973 a new stock and sail were fitted. In the late 1970s, further restoration work was carried out by Millwrights International Ltd. A new cap was craned onto the mill in 1982 and new sails were fitted in 1984. Description Buttrum's Mill is a six-storey tower mill with an ogee cap with a gallery. The tower is diameter internally at the base and diameter at curb level. It is high to the curb. The brickwork is thick at the base. The mill stands to the finial, the tallest surviving mill in Suffolk. The cap is winded by a six-bladed fantail. The four Patent sails of span are carried on a cast-iron windshaft, as is the cast-iron brake wheel with wooden cogs. This drives a cast-iron wallower carried on the cast-iron upright shaft. The wallower can be disengaged from the brake wheel to allow the mill to be driven by auxiliary power. Lower down the upright shaft a cast-iron crown wheel drives auxiliary machinery via layshafts. The cast-iron great spur wheel drives four pairs of overdrift millstones. Two of the four pairs of millstones are controlled by a single governor. The mill is unusual in having a speaking tube connecting the floors. One of the pairs of sails is shorter than the other pair.
