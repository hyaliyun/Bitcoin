The club is also the most honoured in the world, winning 115 trophies in total. This article tells the story of the club from its beginnings covering the European Cup Winners Cup success, the 1902 and 1971 Ibrox disasters, the Nine in a Row league championship wins, and the financial insolvency of the early 2010s, which led to a relaunch in the lower tiers of Scottish football. Formation and early years (1872–1899) Modern-day picture of Flesher's Haugh In March 1872, the club was formed by a group of rowing enthusiasts, brothers, Moses McNeil and Peter McNeil, Peter Campbell and William McBeath, saw a group of men playing football on Glasgow Green's Flesher's Haugh. David Hill was also a founder member. Indeed, the team's first game was at Flesher's Haugh in May 1872 against Callander, which resulted in a 0–0 draw. Moses McNeil suggested the name Rangers after seeing the name Swindon Rangers in a book about English Rugby.We belong to Glasgow ... sort of, Swindon Advertiser, 3 September 2013 Rangers only played two matches in their birth year and their second match, with the team donned in light blue shirts, was a comprehensive 11–0 win over a team named Clyde (not the present Clyde). For the 1875–76 season, Rangers moved to Burnbank Park.https://www.thefounderstrail.co.uk/burnbank Rangers began to grow into a more formal football club and in 1876, for the first time, a player was called up to play international football as Moses McNeil made his Scotland debut against Wales. In 1883 the Glasgow Football Association was formed, with Rangers one of six founder members.Chapter XXV—Glasgow Association, History of the Queen's Park Football Club 1867 - 1917 (via Electric Scotland) In 1888, the now famous Old Firm fixture was born as Rangers met Celtic for the first time in a friendly match; Celtic beat an under-strength Rangers 5–2 with a team composed largely of \\"guest players\\" from Hibernian. The 1890–91 season saw the inception of the Scottish Football League, and Rangers were one of ten original members. By this time Rangers were playing at the first Ibrox Stadium. Rangers' first ever league match took place on 16 August 1890 and resulted in a 5–2 victory over Heart of Midlothian. After finishing equal-top with Dumbarton a play-off was held at Cathkin Park to decide the who would be champions. The match finished 2–2 and the title was shared for the only time in its history, the first of Rangers' world record 54 championships. Rangers had to wait until 1894 to taste their first Scottish Cup success after losing to Vale of Leven in 1877 and 1879 but finally lifted the trophy for the first time after a 3–1 win over Celtic. Rangers even came close to winning the English FA Cup in 1887 when they lost to Aston Villa in the semi-final. Rangers ended the nineteenth century with further Scottish Cup wins 1897 and 1898 and a League Championship win in 1899 during which they won every one of their 18 league matches. Rangers formally became a limited company on 27 May 1899 and the then match secretary William Wilton was appointed as the club's first manager. This also enabled Ibrox stadium to be constructed that same year. The club also appointed its first board of directors under the chairmanship of James Henderson. By the turn of the century Rangers had won two league titles and three Scottish Cups and were well on their way to becoming one of Scotland's top clubs. The Wilton years (1899–1920) The 1902 Ibrox disaster Rangers were in the ascendancy at the turn of the century, winning the championship seven times between 1900 and 1918 (with four League title in a row). The season of 1898–99 was particularly memorable, in that it saw the Gers win all 18 league games to establish a perfect record. This feat has yet to be repeated by the club, although the team did go through the 2013–14 season unbeaten. However, between 1902 and 1910, Celtic took over as the dominant force, and though Rangers had the chance to foil a third League and Cup double in 1909, the Scottish FA withheld the Cup due to disgraceful scenes after a pitch invasion by drunken fans. The Hampden Riot of 1909 had written itself a sorry page in the history books, and both clubs were ordered to compensate hosts Queen's Park for the damage caused by their so-called fans. Having lost the title in 1919 they responded in 1920 with one of the best seasons in their history as manager William Wilton and his right-hand man Bill Struth retained the title netting 106 goals in 42 league games. However, in May 1920 the club's first ever manager, William Wilton, died in a boating accident and Bill Struth was subsequently appointed manager. Struth's era (1920–1954) The portrait of Bill Struth within the Ibrox trophy room Loving Cup ceremony occurs on the first home match at Ibrox stadium in January The key statistic of the 1930s was three consecutive Scottish Cup wins from 1934, 1935, 1936. History was there to be made in 1937 when they set out on the trail of a fourth win, only to lose in the First round to lowly Queen of the South. Ironically, this was the first Rangers game ever to be immortalised on film. The post-war seasons saw Rangers well on top, but not before a boardroom coup in the summer of 1947. The board of Rangers had previously been an amateur body made up of former players, but when chairman James Bowie suggested a 71-year-old Struth retire in order to allow a younger man to take charge, a revolution occurred. Bowie was forced out the chair and was said never to have set foot in Ibrox ever again such was his disdain for the circumstances of his departure. Struth went on to steer Rangers to 18 league championships, 10 Scottish Cups and 2 League Cups in his 34-year tenure as manager. He was also the first Rangers manager to win the domestic treble when it was achieved for the first time in Scottish football history in season 1948–49, the success based on the so-called Iron Curtain defence which remained virtually unchanged from 1946 to 1953.Rangers History #5: Blue Steel, Rangers FC, 1 January 2016 After Bill Struth collected two more domestic doubles in 1950 and 1953, Scot Symon was appointed as Rangers third manager on 15 June 1954. Under Symon (1954–1967) Symon continued Struth's success by winning six league championships, five Scottish Cups and four League Cups. He also became the second manager to win the domestic treble in season 1963–64. Another purple patch began at the end of the 1950s: from 1957 until 1965. Rangers achieved four league titles, plus an equal number of wins in both League and Scottish Cups. This was the era of Slim Jim Baxter, a superb ballplayer who was by turns exhilarating and exasperating. However, Baxter was to depart for England in 1965, there was a player who had been a first–team regular for the past couple of seasons who would mature into an inspirational leader, a stalwart in the dark blue of Scotland and would eventually manage the club. John Greig was that man, and though Rangers would play out the decade in the shadow of their European Cup – winning neighbours, the foundations were being laid for future success. In the 1956–57 season Symon took Rangers into the European Cup for the first time but it ended abruptly, going out on to French team OGC Nice. The following season saw Rangers suffer their worst ever defeat by their arch rivals Celtic, losing 7–1 in the League Cup final of 1957. They did however reach the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1960 losing eventually to German club Eintracht Frankfurt by a record aggregate 12–4 for a Scottish team. In 1961 Rangers became the first British team to reach a European final when they contested the Cup Winners' Cup final against Italian side Fiorentina, only to lose 4–1 on aggregate. Rangers suffered yet more despair in the final of the same competition in 1967, losing 1–0 after extra time to FC Bayern Munich. Following the death of incumbent chairman John Wilson in 1963, Rangers appointed John Lawrence to succeed him. Lawrence had been on the board of Rangers since the mid-1950s and would remain in charge for a decade before resigned to become honorary president. During his tenure as chairman, Lawrence oversaw two of the most pivotal events namely the 1971 Ibrox disaster and the European Cup Winners' Cup Final fifteen months later. His legacy continued in the shape of his grandson, Lawrence Marlborough who inherited his shareholding and was appointed vice-chairman in 1979. Marlborough would go on to revitalise the fortunes of the club in the 1980s before selling his stake in the company that owned the club to David Murray in 1988. After these disappointments, the pressure was on Symon and he paid the penalty of Celtic's success in Scotland and Europe in October 1967, giving way to his former assistant Davie White after rejecting a move to make him general manager with White in charge of team affairs. White takes charge (1967–1969) David White was installed as Rangers' fourth manager on 1 November 1967. He had initially come to Rangers as assistant to manager Symon as part of a grooming process, giving him time to learn the ropes and take over when he was ready. However, it didn't turn out that way and the responsibility came too early. White was on his own and in charge after just five months at the club and just 34 years old. When White took up the reins at Rangers, the team had failed to win the league championship in three seasons, the longest title drought in 50 years. He also happened to be up against one of the greatest ever Celtic managers, in Jock Stein, and teams, the 1967 European Cup Final side. White started incredibly well and went on to win 19 of his first 20 league matches in charge, amassing 39 out of a possible 40 points. The only blemish was a 2–2 draw at Celtic Park on 2 January, which happened to be the side's third game in only four days. The Scottish Cup gave White his first defeat as Rangers manager. A third round replay against Hearts on 13 March looked to be heading for extra time, when in the 87th minute, Donald Ford struck the winner for Hearts. Rangers were out the Cup. Incredibly, this was White's only loss in his first 30 domestic games in charge. A couple of draws in April, and White's first league defeat in the final minute of the final game of the season, 3–2 at home to Aberdeen, cost Rangers the title by two points. Despite accumulating the highest percentage of points won by any Rangers side since Bill Struth's first season and collecting 61 points, which would have won the title in 11 of the past 12 seasons, Rangers were beaten by Celtic. Their Old Firm rivals amassed 63 points and following the Ne'erday derby draw gone on to win all of their remaining league fixtures. In the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup campaign that season Rangers reached the quarter-finals, meeting Leeds United in March 1968. After a 0–0 draw at Ibrox, two goals in six minutes at Elland Road in the second leg were enough to see Leeds progress 2–0 aggregate. Leeds United went on to win the Fairs Cup. The 1968–69 season was to be White's one and only full season in charge at the club. He made two major signings at the start of the season. The first was when he broke the Scottish transfer record and outbid the English Champions Everton to buy Colin Stein from Hibernian for £100,000. Secondly he paid St Johnstone £50,000 for Alex MacDonald. The league campaign till the end of November was inconsistent, 4 draws and 3 defeats from 13 matches, although the side did win the first Old Firm match 4–2 at Celtic Park. Rangers went on a run from December until April where they lost only once in all competitions, 3–2 away to Airdrieonians in the league. The seemed to be unstoppable, an example being one week in the middle of March (15th–22nd), when Rangers beat Clyde 6–0 at Ibrox in the league on the Saturday, with Stein scoring hat-trick before being sent-off, four days later the side beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 at home in the Fairs Cup then followed this three days later by hammering Aberdeen 6–1 in the Scottish Cup semi-final. Stein's disciplinary record caught up with him and he was suspended from the end of March until the end of the season. Without his goals the team dropped six points from the final six league games and conceded the title to Celtic by five points. The route to the 1969 Scottish Cup Final saw Rangers dispose of Hibernian, Hearts and Airdrieonians before meeting Aberdeen in the semi-final. In the final, with Stein suspended, White opted to play Alex Ferguson rather than Sandy Jardine, purely because of the aerial threat of Billy McNeill at corners. Ferguson was blamed for a goal that Rangers conceded only two minutes into the match in which he was designated to mark goalscorer McNeill. Two horrendous mistakes from Örjan Persson and Norrie Martin minutes before the interval, were both seized upon by the 20-year-old George Connolly, resulted in two goals to give Celtic a 3–0 lead at half-time. Rangers lost the game 0–4 and Ferguson was subsequently forced to play for the club's junior side. The Fairs Cup proved fertile once again. Rangers went all the way to the semi- finals, defeating FK Vojvodina (2–1 on aggregate), Dundalk (9–1 on aggregate), DWS Amsterdam (4–1 on aggregate), Bilbao (4–3 on aggregate) before losing 0–2 to Newcastle United on aggregate. The tie was basically lost at Ibrox as Rangers were held to a 0–0 draw, despite numerous chances and yet another missed penalty from Andy Penman. Newcastle United went on to win the trophy. Having brought the legendary Jim Baxter back home at the start of the 1969–70 season, White's faith was repaid immediately when in his first game back at Ibrox, Baxter masterminded a famous 2–1 comeback victory over Celtic in the League Cup sectional round that had the crowd in raptures. In the Cup Winners Cup we beat Steau 2–0 at home, and held out in Bucharest for a 0–0 draw where White cleverly employed John Greig in a sweeper's role. In the second round, despite losing 1–3 away to Górnik Zabrze, confidence was still high that the Rangers could overcome them at Ibrox. He was promising to, \\"attack, attack, attack!\\" in order to progress. Baxter scored a stunning goal after 18 minutes, and it all looked to be going to plan as Rangers sustained pressure continued for the first hour, and then the game changed. Gornik started to play and scored three quite brilliant goals in the final half hour as they toyed with Rangers, looking as if they could score at will. Gornik were applauded off the park. The next day, 27 November 1969, White's assistant Willie Thornton took over as caretaker and the club began to look for a new manager. The lack of honours during White's reign at Ibrox, however, masks the fact that he did improve the team during a difficult period. Celtic, under Stein, were at the peak of their success and White, as Rangers' first track suit manager working on the pitch with the players every day, did not fail through any lack of tactical knowledge. In his two seasons in charge Rangers had finished 2 points and 5 points behind Celtic. White was replaced by Willie Waddell, the former Rangers legendary winger, who had also won the Championship as a manager in 1965 with Kilmarnock, before returning to journalism with the Daily Express, where he was heavily critical of Rangers, and White in particular, referring to him as 'the Boy David'. With Waddell in charge, the next three seasons saw Rangers finish 12, 15 and 16 points adrift of Celtic in the Championship – 2 points for a win back then. The team also failed to beat Celtic in 10 of the 11 games it played with Waddell at the helm. Waddell era: European success and national tragedy (1969–1972) William Waddell, a former player who had made himself a name both in journalism and as the manager of Kilmarnock's championship-winning side of 1964–65, was appointed as Rangers manager on 8 December the same year. In 1972 he guided Rangers to their first, and to date only, European triumph when they defeated Dynamo Moscow 3–2 in the Cup Winners' Cup final at the Camp Nou in Barcelona. Due to a pitch invasion at the end of the match, the team were presented with the trophy in the dressing room. Following pressure exerted by the Spanish Government of Generalissimo Francisco Franco, UEFA banned Rangers from defending the cup. This was perceived by some as a disproportionate and politically motivated decision, as evidenced by Barcelona's decision to invite Rangers to participate in their pre-season Trofeo Joan Gamper tournament (named after the club's founder) in 1974, alongside the Basque team Athletic Club de Bilbao. The triumph in the European Cup Winners' Cup came less than two years after the 1971 Ibrox disaster, when 66 people died leaving the east terrace at staircase 13. Within weeks of their European success, Waddell moved to the general manager position and his coach Jock Wallace was appointed as manager. The reasons for the 51-year-old Waddell relinquishing the reins at Rangers were never fully explained but he probably saw the coaching of players as a younger mans job. He also became determined to complete the reconstruction of Ibrox Stadium. Waddell's spell can only be seen as a unique achievement. In just little over two years he had enforced discipline and order to the club. This in turn brought European success and broke the dominance of Celtic, if only in the League Cup. Waddell also oversaw the recovery after the second Ibrox disaster, helping the families of the victims and forging strong links with supports' clubs. Wallace becomes manager (1972–1978) Jock Wallace's managership of Rangers saw the club achieve a period of sustained success. His first season as manager, 1972–73 was the club's centenary year. After taking over the first-team managers position on 31 May 1972, Wallace set about reshaping the side. He moved on Colin Stein and Willie Johnston to Coventry City and West Bromwich Albion respectively, bringing in Quinton Young, Joe Mason and Tom Forsyth. After a stuttering start to the league campaign, three defeats and a draw from the first six matches, the sides fortunes greatly improved. From October to the end of the season Rangers suffered only one league defeat, at home to Hearts on 2 December 1972, and went on a run of sixteen wins. However this run was not enough to become league champions as the side finished second, one point behind Celtic. In the cup competitions, the Scottish Cup campaign was to culminate in a 3–2 win over Celtic. The final was attended by Princess Alexandra along with 122,714 other spectators. It was Rangers first Scottish Cup win in seven years. The League Cup run was ended in the semi- finals at the hands of Hibernian after a 1–0 defeat. This season also saw compete in the first ever European Super Cup. The side played the European Cup holders Ajax in January 1973. The Dutch side were the only continental opposition the side faced that season due to the club's European competition ban. In the end Ajax proved to strong and recorded a 6–3 aggregate win, with Rangers losing 1–3 at Ibrox and 3–2 in Amsterdam. In the summer of 1973 Rangers chairman John Lawerence retired and was replaced by vice-chairman Matt Taylor. A nine-year period of Celtic dominance in the league was ended in 1974–75 as Rangers captured what was to be the last championship of its kind. The new ten-team Scottish Premier Division saw Rangers crowned inaugural champions, as part of a triumphant domestic treble. A barren subsequent season in 1976–77. Wallace presided over the club's fourth domestic treble and second in three years in 1977–78. During the close season Rangers spent heavily in the transfer market, bringing in Davie Cooper from Clydebank for £100,000 and Gordon Smith from Kilmarnock for £65,000. They were joined at the club by Bobby Russell who arrived from Shettleston Juniors for free. Despite these expensive signings the side did not make the best start to the league campaign, losing the opening two matches to Aberdeen and Hibernian. Order was restored the following week with a 4–0 defeat of Partick Thistle. A resounding 3–2 win over Celtic in the first Old Firm match of the season set the tone of the season. Rangers had been 2–0 down at half-time but recovered to win the game after outclassing Jock Stein's side in the second 45 minutes. In March 1978, second placed Aberdeen won 3–0 at Ibrox to set up a tense title run in. Rangers dropped seven points from twenty-one but held on winning the final four fixtures and the league. The League Cup was won by defeating Celtic 2–1 after extra time. Goals from season new boys Davie Cooper and Gordon Smith completed the first leg of the treble. The 2–1 1978 Scottish Cup Final win over Aberdeen made Wallace the only Rangers' manager to win two domestic treble's. Surprisingly despite this unprecedented success Wallace resigned from his position on 23 May 1978. The reason for his departure was never revealed but it is widely believed that a breakdown in the working relationship between Wallace and general manager William Waddell was the cause. At a time when Ibrox Park was undergoing extensive redevelopment the transfer budget was to suffer. Waddell was suspected of vetoing many signings, Alan Hansen from Partick Thistle and David Narey from Dundee United among them, in favour of investing in the rebuilding project. The burst of success under Wallace in the mid-1970s saw Rangers once again established as Scotland's most successful club. When Wallace, suddenly and unexpectedly, announced his resignation, Rangers turned to another of the stalwarts of the great side of the mid-to-late 1970s, the captain John Greig. John Greig, from captain to manager (1978–1983) After the departure of Wallace the board acted quickly to replace the void with club captain Greig being promoted to first-team manager. Greig took a phone call on the day of Wallace's resignation from general manager Waddell. Greig was playing golf with teammate Sandy Jardine when Waddell called him to offer him the job. On 24 May 1978 Greig was confirmed as the seventh manager of Rangers. Greig's tenure began promisingly. The 1978–79 season could so easily have mirrored the previous. Despite a fixture pile-up which resulted from the club playing three league games in nearly three months, and some overly negative tactics from Greig, Rangers came close to winning a quadruple of trophies. Unfortunately it was not to be and the season ended with just the domestic cup double. Wallace's treble-winning team of the previous season performed ably in the European Cup. Rangers eliminated Juventus after defeating the Italians 2–1 on aggregate – the first time Rangers had ever recovered from a first-leg defeat to win a two-legged European tie. Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, the then UEFA Cup holders, were overcome in the next round (the club's first home defeat in European competition), before an injury-stricken Rangers side lost to Cologne at the quarter-final stage. 120px The early season league form was terrible as the team failed to win any of the first six league matches but a run was put together. Things began to unravel, however, as leadership of the league evaporated. The team had to settle for second place behind champions Celtic. The pivotal match was a 4–2 Old Firm defeat a Parkhead. There was success for Greig in the national cup competitions. Victory in the 1979 Scottish Cup Final over Hibernian required a second replay to separate the sides before Rangers eventually won 3–2. The 1979 Scottish League Cup Final ended in a 2–1 win for Rangers over a strong Aberdeen with goals from Alex MacDonald and Colin Jackson. The following the season finished trophyless. Rangers finished an embarrassing fifth in the league, eleven points behind champions Aberdeen. The main cause for such a poor showing in the league was pointed at the team's away form, only ten points from eighteen matches. Aberdeen also knocked Rangers out of the Scottish League Cup over a two-legged third round tie. Rangers did reach the 1980 Scottish Cup Final only to lose out to Old Firm rivals Celtic, 1–0 thanks to a deflected George McCluskey shot in extra time. The European Cup Winner's Cup campaign was ended by the eventual winners Valencia CF after having seen off Lilliestrom and Fortuna Düsseldorf in previous rounds. The summer of 1980 saw Greig bring in Jim Bett from Lokeren for £150,000. Bett was joined by Colin McAdam a £165,000 signing from Partick Thistle. The side got off to a good start in the league, going on a fifteen match unbeaten run, including two Old Firm wins, was to end in November. A disastrous run in November and December all but ended the title challenge as the team finished third, twelve points behind champions Celtic. The League Cup campaign was halted after a controversial defeat by Aberdeen in a match where the Dons were awarded two contentious penalties. Due to having no European participation, Rangers entered the Anglo-Scottish Cup which led to humiliation and embarrassment at the hands of English minnows, Chesterfield. The third division side held Rangers to a 1–1 draw at Ibrox before defeating Rangers 3–0 in the away leg at Saltergate. Rangers did win the 1981 Scottish Cup Final after beating Dundee United 4–1 in a final replay. After a tedious 0–0 draw where Ian Redford missed a last minute penalty, Rangers won the replay with goals from Davie Cooper, a John MacDonald double and Bobby Russell. Greig's fourth season in charge, 1981–82, ended yet again without the league championship. Rangers finished third, twelve points behind Old Firm rivals Celtic who were champions. There was an apparent lack of ambition at the club due a lack of transfer funds which were being directed towards the redevelopment of Ibrox Park. There was the surprise signing of Northern Ireland international John McClelland from Mansfield Town. The Ulsterman proved to be a shrewd acquisition and later became the club captain. European participation was halted by Dukla Prague who soundly beat the team 3–0 in Prague and a 2–1 second leg win for Rangers was not enough for the team to progress. The domestic cup competitions provided successful ground as Rangers reached both finals. The team lost the 1982 Scottish Cup Final 4–1 to Aberdeen despite leading for the majority of the match. A late Aberdeen equaliser took the game into extra-time before the Dons added a trio. Rangers did win the 1982 Scottish League Cup Final by defeating Dundee United 2–1 with goals from Davie Cooper and Ian Redford. Greig made big-money signings in the pre-season 1982–83 with renewed hope that they could at least mount a serious title challenge, but once again, the season ended in trophyless failure. Dave MacKinnon – £30,000 from Partick Thistle, Craig Paterson – £200,000 from Hibernian, Robert Prytz from Malmö FF and Sandy Clark from West Ham United, were all welcomed to the club. The early signs were positive. Rangers reached the 1983 Scottish League Cup Final scoring en route 29 goals in their ten games and eliminated Borussia Dortmund from the UEFA Cup. The opening eight league games saw the side unbeaten but the final match saw Rangers lying in fourth, a massive eighteen points behind champions Dundee United. The team was knocked out of Europe after suffering a 5–0 defeat from Cologne. The 1983 Scottish Cup Final was lost to an Aberdeen side that had won the European Cup Winner's Cup ten days earlier. The 1983–84 season would signal the end of John Greig's managerial career. The league season began badly, one point from the first four league games, although the team did win their six League Cup games under Greig. A fruitful brief run in the European Cup Winner's Cup saw Rangers win the second round, first leg 2–1 over F.C. Porto after the team's record breaking 18–0 aggregate win over Maltese champions Valletta. After the first nine league games, Greig's team had collected just ten points from twenty- seven. In the end the pressure was too much and Greig resigned from his post on 28 October 1983. Greig's efforts to restructure the team inherited from Wallace proved, for the most part, fruitless. The early years of the 1980s were ones of repeated frustration as the club continually failed to mount a challenge not only to Celtic, but to the resurgent New Firm of Aberdeen and Dundee United. The gloom of under-performance in the league was punctuated only by periodic cup triumphs. The Scottish Cup win of 1981, in particular, saw a triumphant performance by the enigmatic winger, Davie Cooper. The League Cup proved fertile territory for Rangers throughout the fallow years of the early 1980s, but it was the failure to add to the league triumph of 1978 that saw the growing pressure on Greig culminate in his resignation as manager in October 1983. During this period attendances at Ibrox dwindled from an average 25,628 in season 1978–79 to 17,681 in 1982–83.The Roar of the Crowd, David Ross, 2005, page 102. Return of Wallace (1983–1986) Jock Wallace Rangers hoped to rekindle success by bringing Jock Wallace back to the club, following his exile in England with Leicester City. Wallace, though, was not the club's first choice: Jim McLean and Alex Ferguson, the then managers of the New Firm clubs, both rebuffed Rangers' advances. McLean's brother Tommy was appointed caretaker manager and four games passed before a permanent manager was in position. On 10 November 1983, Jock Wallace was persuaded by the Rangers board to leave Motherwell and return to the club. His aim was to restore the glory years of the treble-winning sides of the late 1970s. Wallace's initial impact was positive, boosting morale and fitness. He made changes to the coaching staff, bringing in Alex Totten as first team coach with Tommy McLean, David Provan and Joe Mason leaving. Wallace also added to the squad during the season, Bobby Williamson arrived from Clydebank, Nicky Walker from old club Motherwell and Stuart Munro from Alloa Athletic. Wallace's first match in command was at Pittodrie on 12 November 1983. The game ended in a 3–0 defeat but the side went on a 22 match unbeaten run in all competitions until March 1984. Yet, Rangers still ended that season fourth in the league, fifteen points behind champions Aberdeen . The club did win a trophy, the League Cup. The League Cup final was a thrilling extra-time victory over Celtic, with Ally McCoist scoring a hat-tick in a 3–2 win. The 1984–85 season, Wallace's first full season in charge since his return, was almost a carbon copy of its predecessor. Rangers again finished fourth in the league but it was by a record twenty-one point margin behind champions Aberdeen. This disappointing performance was not caused due to a lack of investment in the playing squad. A total of £495,000 was spent bringing in Iain Ferguson and Cammy Fraser from Dundee, Ted McMinn from Queen of the South and bringing back Derek Johnstone from Chelsea. The club won the Scottish League Cup for the second season in a row defeating Dundee United in the final. A solitary Iain Ferguson strike gave Rangers a 1–0 win. A reasonable start was made to Wallace's second full season in charge. Five wins out of six matches in the league plus a further two wins in the League Cup. However, things quickly began to sour as a fall out between manager and then club captain, John McClelland saw the latter stripped of the captaincy. McClelland was soon sold to Watford in November 1985 for £265,000. The Ulsterman was missed and the team's form was to suffer. By the turn of the year Rangers were in third position in the league. From 1 January 1986, the side won only a quarter of the remaining sixteen league fixtures. With no hope of a trophy, after defeats in the Scottish Cup third round and the League Cup semi-final, things looked bleak for the club. So perhaps it came as no surprise that on 7 April 1986, Wallace resigned as manager of the club. He was to jump before being pushed by the then newly appointed Rangers chairman David Holmes. Holmes had gone on record saying that the slump the club was in could not be allowed to go on. Wallace's side might have won the League Cup twice in a row, but the league form remained indifferent. The continuing dominance of the great Aberdeen side of the 1980s, coupled with strong Dundee United and Celtic teams that offered periodic challenges to Aberdeen's ascendancy, placed Wallace under increasing pressure. By the 1985–86 season Rangers had slipped to fifth place in the league and, with little evidence of improvement since the Greig era, it was inevitable that Wallace would be removed as manager. However, the search for Wallace's replacement was a brief one. The Souness Revolution (1986–1991) On 7 April 1986, Graeme Souness was appointed as Rangers' first player-manager by chairman David Holmes. Souness had previously been playing in Italy with U.C. Sampdoria and made the move to Glasgow for a £300,000 fee. This was the first of many big money transfer deals to be made at Rangers. Although the first deal Souness was involved with was regarding his backroom staff. He brought in Walter Smith, from Dundee United as his assistant and ex-Coventry City manager Don Mackay as reserve-team coach. His first match in charge of Rangers was the club's final league fixture of the season on 3 May 1986. Souness and Smith were introduced to the 22,000 crowd at Ibrox and were given a rousing reception. The team then went on to defeat Motherwell 2–0 to clinch the final qualification spot for the following season's UEFA Cup in what had been an otherwise dismal year for the club. Six days later Souness won his trophy at Rangers when they defeated Celtic 3–2 after extra time in the Glasgow Cup final, Ally McCoist scoring a hat-trick in front of over 40,000 fans at Ibrox. Souness' first flurry into the transfer market over the summer resulted in a £175,000 purchase, Colin West. The investment made in West was small compared to that made in other members of the playing staff. Souness took advantage of the European competition ban imposed by UEFA on English clubs after the Heysel Stadium Disaster. Due to this, plus a sizeable transfer kitty, he was able to attract the cream of English sides talent. The first of many international players arrived in the shape of Chris Woods, followed by the likes of England deputy captain Terry Butcher and former Manchester United defender Jimmy Nicholl. The 1986–87 season would be the first time in eight seasons that Rangers finished top of the Scottish Premier Division. However, the season began eventfully with player-manager Souness being sent-off in the first league match of the season on 9 August 1986. A violent foul on Hibernian's George McCluskey meant Souness had to watch the 2–1 defeat from the stands. But forty-three matches; thirty- one wins, seven draws and five defeats later Rangers were the champions. The league crown was not Souness' only trophy that season however, a 2–1 win over Celtic gave them a 1986 Scottish League Cup Final win. That same season, goalkeeper Chris Woods set the then British football shut out record of 1196 minutes. From 26 November 1986, when he conceded a goal in a UEFA Cup 1–1 draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach, until 14 games later on 30 January 1987 when Adrian Sprott of Hamilton Academical knocked Rangers out of the Scottish Cup by a single goal. The following season Rangers could not build on the success of the previous. Despite the arrivals of Trevor Francis, Ray Wilkins, Mark Walters, Mark Falco, John Brown and Richard Gough, who became Scotland's first £1 million player. The title defence began badly, three points from the first ten, that added with injuries and suspensions meant the club finished third, twelve points behind champions Celtic. The League Cup Final victory was the only bright spark that season, although there was a decent run the European Cup with Dynamo Kiev and David White's foes Górnik Zabrze as scalps. A final against Aberdeen saw Rangers win 5–3 on penalties after drawing 3–3. The Scottish Cup ended in the fourth round at the hands of Dunfermline Athletic. The 1988–89 season was to start what would be one of the most successful spells of Rangers history. When Souness' side regained the league championship by a margin of six points from second-placed Aberdeen, few could predict that would be the first of nine. The club had again invested heavily in the playing staff. Again the club imported players from English sides with Gary Stevens joining from Everton and Kevin Drinkell from Norwich City. A pre-season spent in Italy was the perfect build-up to the new season. The team were unbeaten in all competitions in August and September, including a 5–1 mauling of Celtic at Ibrox. The initiative gained was never really lost and Rangers collected fifty-six points from thirty-six games, twenty-six of which were victories. The League Cup was again at Ibrox as the side again beat a determined Aberdeen team. The final came just a fortnight after the sides met in the league, Rangers lost 2–1 in the Granite City. During the game Aberdeen's Neil Simpson inflicted a terrible tackle on Rangers midfielder Ian Durrant which left the latter with a knee injury for over three years. But for a 1–0 defeat by Celtic in the 1989 Scottish Cup Final, the treble would have rested at Ibrox that season. The arrival of businessman David Murray in 1988 continued the Rangers' resurgence. Murray had acquired Rangers for £6 million from the club's then owner, the Nevada-based Lawrence Marlborough on 23 November 1988. History could have been very different however, had he not been rejected by home town club Ayr United. Murray officially became chairman on 2 June 1989, replacing David Holmes. Murray retained the ambitious strategy he had inherited from Holmes. This was demonstrated on 10 July 1989 when Rangers, acting on Souness' say so, purchased former Celtic striker Mo Johnston from French club FC Nantes for £1.5 million. The fact Rangers signed an ex-Celtic player would have been a big enough story but the fact Johnston was a high-profile Roman Catholic made the move unprecedented. The transfer angered both sides of the Old Firm's support, Rangers' because Johnston was an ex-Celtic player and Catholic. Rangers, seen as the Protestant club in Glasgow, had a policy of not employing Catholics. Celtic fans saw Johnston as a turncoat who had already committed to re-join Celtic from Nantes before Rangers made known their interest. When the season began, Rangers did not. Three matches played in the league, no wins and two defeats. However, the team slowly got into gear, despite only two wins from the first eight games. New arrival Johnston netted the crucial winner during an Old Firm game on 4 November 1989. Scoring the goal in the dying minutes of the match meant Johnston was all but forgiven by the Rangers support. Come May 1990, Rangers' name was on the trophy for the second time in as many seasons but the club again failed to win the Scottish Cup, losing to Celtic in the fourth round, and for once did not win the League Cup. The side lost to Aberdeen by 2–1 in the final. The 1990–91 season would be Souness's last season in charge. On 16 April 1991, the fiery Scot departed for his former club Liverpool before the league campaign reached its dramatic culmination, saying he had \\"gone as far as he would be allowed to go\\". A last- day victory over Aberdeen at Ibrox gave Rangers Three in a Row. Souness assistant Walter Smith was in charge that day. Before his departure Souness had made sure to fall out with and sell on club captain Terry Butcher and spend big money on striker Mark Hateley, winger Pieter Huistra and forgotten man Oleg Kuznetsov. Sadly for Souness though he was never to win a Scottish Cup with Rangers as the team went down 2–0 to Celtic at Parkhead, for the second season in a row. The 1990 Scottish League Cup Final ended in another victory, however. The Souness years were marked by both achievement and conflict. Under Souness's stewardship, Rangers' preeminence in the Scottish game was restored. At a time in which English clubs were excluded from European competition, the club also gained arguably a higher profile in the British game than at any time in its history. This was fuelled by the purchase of a succession of English internationals, including Ray Wilkins, Terry Butcher and Chris Woods. It was also fuelled by the controversial signing of Roman Catholic and former Celtic player Mo Johnston, who was persuaded to change his mind at the last minute and sign for Rangers rather than their bitter city rivals. Johnston's signing led to outrage from some fans of the traditionally Protestant club as he became the first high-profile Catholic to sign for Rangers in modern times. Despite his success, Souness was never part of the Scottish footballing establishment. His manager-ship saw countless run- ins with the footballing authorities. He was sent-off in his debut and suffered more than one touchline ban. Souness's departure met with mixed reactions amongst Rangers supporters. Many were disappointed, some bemoaned what they saw as his betrayal of the club, all however, were united in viewing the Souness revolution as among the most dramatic period in Rangers' history. Smith's tenure (1991–1998) The ninth manager of Rangers was a man who had previously worked as assistant to the eighth, Walter Smith. He was appointed manager on 19 April 1991, a day before a crucial Scottish Premier Division match away to St Mirren. Smith guided the side to a 1–0 win and followed that with a similar result at home to Dundee United before a devastating 3–0 loss away to Motherwell nearly derailed the sides championship hopes. A last supreme effort was required if the club was to claim a third league title in succession. The final league game of the season was at home to title challengers Aberdeen, with a draw being all that was needed by the Dons to be crowned champions. A tense match ensured but a Mark Hateley brace in front of a 37,652-strong Ibrox crowd gave Rangers the win and the league championship. In his first full season in charge, Smith began to make changes. He brought in Archie Knox from Manchester United, as his assistant and also altered the playing personnel. Smith moved on Trevor Steven for a fee of £5.58 million to Olympique Marseille. Amongst those who also left were Chris Woods, Mo Johnston, Mark Walters to Sheffield Wednesday, Everton and Liverpool respectively. Smith, with the financial backing of Chairman David Murray, signed Andy Goram, Alexei Mikhailichenko, Stuart McCall, David Robertson and the perhaps less successful pair of Dale Gordon and Paul Rideout. A fourth successive championship was secured that season, for the first time in over sixty years. Rangers topped the Division with a total of seventy-two points, nine ahead of second-placed Heart of Midlothian. The side scored one hundred and one goals and were victorious in nineteen of their twenty-two away fixtures. The success continued into the Scottish Cup as Rangers won the 1992 final beating Airdrieonians 2–1 to win the trophy for the first time in eleven years. The 1992–93 season was arguably one of the most successful in the club's history and the best European campaign since 1972. Not only did the team win the domestic treble but they also came to within one match of the 1993 UEFA Champions League Final. Rangers saw off English First Division champions Leeds United in a tie dubbed the Battle of Britain. Then, in the group stage, Rangers won two matches and drew four but, despite remaining undefeated, went out to the French team Olympique de Marseille, who were later found guilty of match fixing. No foul play was found with regards to the Rangers matches however. Rangers won the double the following season but missed out on a back-to-back domestic treble after losing in the 1994 Scottish Cup Final to Dundee United. It was a classic giant killing act. United had had a fairly moderate season, winning only eleven of their forty-four league matches. It was United's seventh appearance in a Scottish Cup final, having lost all six of their previous encounters. A forty-seventh minute Craig Brewster goal gave Dundee United a 1–0 win after a sloppy back pass by Dave McPherson. It was a strange end to a very successful domestic season for Rangers. The 1994–95 season saw Rangers make two big money signings, Basile Boli and Brian Laudrup, for £2.7 million and £2.4 million respectively. The latter proved to be an absolute bargain. Laudrup became a firm fans favourite during his four-year spell with Rangers and was even elected to the Rangers Hall of Fame. Boli on the other hand lasted just one season. The French defender completely failed to adapt to the rigours of the Scottish game. Despite the failure of a rather expensive footballer, Rangers continued to rack up the league titles. The sixth consecutive championship won in style. The club sat top of the Scottish Premier Division on sixty-nine points, a whole fifteen points ahead of second placed Motherwell. Yet both domestic cup competitions ended before the last eight, and the failure to reach the UEFA Champions League group stage meant that to many, the season was almost regarded as a failure. Rangers won the championship in season 1995–96 with the help of one Paul Gascoigne. The Englishman was signed 10 July 1995 from Italian side Lazio. He made an instant impact at Rangers, running almost the length of the pitch to score in an Old Firm match at Celtic Park, during the fifth league game of the season. On 30 December 1995, in a match against Hibernian, Gascoigne 'booked' referee Dougie Smith. Smith had dropped his yellow card and Gascoigne picked it up and showed it to the official, before returning it. Smith was not amused and booked Gascoigne. Rangers went on to win the league, clinching the title in the penultimate game of the season against Aberdeen. After Rangers went 1–0 down in the early stages, Gascoigne went on to score a hat-trick to give the club a 3–1 victory and the championship. Joining the league crown in the Ibrox trophy cabinet was the 1996 Scottish Cup which Rangers won after a 5–1 defeat of Hearts. A hat-trick from Gordon Durie and a Brian Laudrup double won Rangers their 27th Scottish Cup win. In season 1996–97 Rangers went on to win their ninth championship in a row thereby equalling Celtic's achievement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the cup competitions, they were knocked out of the Scottish Cup at the quarter-finals stage, losing 2–0 to Celtic. However, the team won the League Cup, defeating Heart of Midlothian 4–3. The European campaign proved to be a disaster. Although the team qualified for the UEFA Champions League after a fine 10–3 aggregate win over Russian champions Alania Vladikavkaz, they only recorded three points from their six group matches. The season 1997–98 proved to be Walter Smith's last season as manager and Rangers were unable to win their tenth league championship in a row. The early season form of new signing Marco Negri gave the team fresh impetus but when the manager Walter Smith announced that he would leave the club at the end of the season the team's form dipped. The side finished the league on 72 points, two behind champions Celtic after taking the title race to the last day of the season. The club ended the season trophy-less for the first time in twelve seasons as they lost the 1998 Scottish Cup Final to Heart of Midlothian 2–1 and were knocked out League Cup in the quarter-finals by Dundee United. In Europe, the club failed to reach the Champions League group stages and they fell at the first hurdle in the UEFA Cup, losing both legs 2–1 to RC Strasbourg. Smith left Rangers and joined Premier League club Everton. Many players from the Nine in a Row era left Rangers including Brian Laudrup, Ally McCoist, Ian Durrant, Stuart McCall and club captain Richard Gough. The Little General (1998–2001) Dick Advocaat Dick Advocaat, nicknamed the Little General, succeeded Walter Smith on 1 June 1998. Advocaat, former manager of PSV Eindhoven, became only Rangers' tenth manager and was the first non-Scot to hold the position. His appointment was viewed as reflecting a desire to begin to challenge Europe's elite clubs. David Murray, the club's owner and chairman, had long proclaimed that Rangers ought to be judged not just in relation to success in Scotland, but on performance in Europe, and especially in the UEFA Champions League. Despite being given resources on a scale never before handed to a Rangers manager, success on a larger stage failed to materialise, and the costly legacy of Advocaat's time at Ibrox was a debt that would cripple the club for years. The scale of these resources made available to Advocaat initially confirmed that the Rangers management was thinking in bold, European terms. Confronted with a rump of players remaining after Smith's departure, Advocaat was furnished with an unprecedented transfer budget over the coming seasons. In total Advocaat spent over £36 million on new players in his debut season. However, while Advocaat's record in transfer dealings remained mixed throughout his time at Ibrox, at first the club appeared to be beginning to deliver in playing terms, both in Scotland and (less predictably) Europe. Advocaat's first season saw another domestic treble secured. Performance in Europe was promising, with Bayer Leverkusen defeated in a solid, if unspectacular, UEFA Cup run. Murray Park In the following season, Advocaat continued to spend big, bringing the likes of Michael Mols and Claudio Reyna to Ibrox. A domestic double was secured in Advocaat's second season. In Europe, too, there were signs of greatly improved performance in the Champions League, as Parma were defeated en route to qualification for the group stages of the competition. During this season, Rangers Football Club Ltd floated on what was the Ofex market Rangers entered Advocaat's third season emboldened by the capture of five of the six domestic trophies available in his first two years. However, while the club again qualified for the Champions League group stage, performances in the league began rapidly to disintegrate. Further high- profile signings – Tore André Flo for a club record £12 million, and the Dutch internationalist Ronald de Boer on a lavish contract – could not reverse the decline. Morale amongst players and supporters plummeted amidst credible rumours of players unrest and dressing room divides. A worsening financial position exacerbated the gathering gloom. The club failed to win a major competition in the 2000–01 season, as Celtic swept the domestic board. Having continued in similar fashion in 2001–02, and with Martin O'Neill's Celtic side once more running away with the championship, Advocaat resigned as manager and took up a general manager position, which he would leave after only 11 months. Alex McLeish was appointed the new Rangers manager in December 2001. Advocaat's tenure at Ibrox had been a paradoxical one. On one hand, Advocaat spearheaded the building of Murray Park – a £14m training complex at Auchenhowie which was viewed as essential if the club was to compete with its European peers in nurturing home-grown talent and developing players. On the other hand, with the club deep in financial difficulty, there was no realistic prospect of boosting its fortunes through further expensive player acquisitions. The challenge of restoring the club to supremacy in Scotland looked to be an unenviable one for Alex McLeish. Financial constraints under McLeish (2001–2006) Murray appointed ex-Aberdeen defender Alex McLeish as the club's eleventh manager on 11 December 2001, joining McLeish was assistant Andy Watson. Murray's choice of manager was met with a lukewarm reaction amongst many Rangers supporters. Many fans viewed it as symptomatic of the downsizing of the club's ambitions, while others saw in McLeish a manager whose mixed fortunes at Hibernian and Motherwell left him ill-equipped to cope with the demands of managing a high-profile club like Rangers. However, McLeish was the number one managerial target on a four-man shortlist. Others said to be included on the list were the then Ipswich Town manager George Burley, former Germany coach Berti Vogts and George Graham. Fans concerns were quickly allayed as McLeish's Rangers team began to display a spirit that had been sorely lacking in the twilight of Advocaat's reign. A Scottish Cup and League Cup double in McLeish's first half-season, 2001–02, saw a renewed sense of optimism that Rangers could regain the ascendancy claimed by Celtic under the managership of Martin O'Neill. A dramatic 3–2 defeat of Celtic in the 2002 Scottish Cup Final, orchestrated by Barry Ferguson and marked by a dramatic Peter Løvenkrands last minute winner, was the perfect end to a disappointing season. In McLeish's first full season as manager, 2002–03, the club won its seventh domestic treble. The Scottish Premier League title was secured after an astonishingly tense run-in. Going into the final round both sides were equal on 94 points but Rangers had a one-goal advantage and sat top of the league. On a dramatic last day, a 6–1 victory over Dunfermline Athletic denied Celtic the title on goal difference after the Parkhead club beat Kilmarnock 4–0. The destination of the title was unknown until the final seconds of this match with both teams level on points and goal difference. Only a last-minute penalty by Mikel Arteta clinched the league for Rangers. A victory over Celtic in the 2003 Scottish League Cup Final in March, provided the first leg of the club's seventh treble. A somewhat drab and anti-climactic 1–0 victory over Dundee in the 2003 Scottish Cup Final the following May saw a triumphant finalé to the season. It was a near-flawless start to McLeish's reign, ruined only by a poor showing in Europe, which Rangers exited in the first round to minnows Viktoria Žižkov. The following season, McLeish's initial period as manager proved difficult to sustain. The club's perilous financial position in the wake of the profligacy of the Advocaat era, meant a period of relative austerity. The wage bill had to be slashed as the club embarked on an extensive cost-cutting programme in an attempt to stabilise a mushrooming and unsustainable level of debt. Confronted with a squad of well-paid but ageing players assembled by Advocaat, McLeish was compelled to rebuild without the luxury of the generous transfer kitty enjoyed by some of his predecessors. McLeish was to lose, from his treble winning squad, the inspirational if mistake-prone defender Lorenzo Amoruso, Scottish international winger Neil McCann and, most damagingly of all, club captain Barry Ferguson. In their place McLeish was required to rebuild with only the use of Bosman free transfers and loan signings. After a good start to the 2003–04 season which saw the side top of the league and qualify for UEFA Champions League (thanks to a dramatic late goal in Denmark against FC Copenhagen), the loss of Ferguson shortly afterwards led to a dramatic downturn in results and ultimately a trophyless campaign. McLeish's signings of experienced players, such as the Brazilian midfielder Emerson, Norway forward Egil Østenstad and, most damaging of all, the £600,000 signing Nuno Capucho, proved disastrous and have since entered Ibrox folklore as some of the worst players to play for Rangers. The 2004–05 season started in the same vein, with McLeish making another poor signing in Serbian midfielder, Dragan Mladenovic, for £1m. The Serb would manage less than ten games for the club. On the pitch, the team again fell behind Celtic in the league and exited the Champions League at the qualifying stage. It was rumoured that failure to gain entry into the new UEFA Cup group stage would see McLeish lose his job, but another late goal and a penalty shoot out win over CS Marítimo of Portugal provided him with a stay of execution. After this, his fortunes began to turn again. Mladenovic aside, McLeish had made some canny signings in the summer, such as Nacho Novo, plus the Bosmans Dado Pršo, Jean-Alain Boumsong along with midfielder Alex Rae. Once these players settled in, the team began to recover ground on O'Neill's ageing Celtic side. Boumsong, in particular, was a great success but he was sold in January 2005, after only six months at the club, to then Premier League side Newcastle United (managed by former boss Graeme Souness) for £8m. This cash paved the way for more signings, including Thomas Buffel, Sotirios Kyrgiakos and the return of former captain Barry Ferguson. The 2005 Scottish League Cup Final in March 2005 ended in a 5–1 victory over Motherwell . The league, however, appeared to have been lost. Despite catching and overtaking Celtic (with two Old Firm wins, including a pivotal 2–0 victory at Celtic Park in what was McLeish's first win there as Rangers manager) nerves seemed to get the better of Rangers. A loss to Celtic in the last derby of the season at Ibrox, handed a five-point lead to their rivals with only four games of remaining, and seemed to end hopes of the title. However, Rangers kept its winnings way and a 3–1 Celtic home loss to Hibernian meant only two points separated the sides going into the final game of the season. Rangers needed to win at Hibernian and hope that Celtic would drop points at Fir Park. In perhaps even more dramatic circumstances than two years previously. , Motherwell overcame a 1–0 deficit with two goals in injury time from Scott McDonald to defeat the Parkhead side, while Rangers edged out a tight 1–0 win at Easter Road. For 89 minutes of the match, Rangers thought their rivals were set for the title, and once news broke of Motherwell's late intervention, ecstasy awaited for the Ibrox legions. Even the helicopter that was carrying the league trophy was on its way to Motherwell so it had to turn around and fly to Edinburgh. That day has passed into Ibrox folklore, becoming known as Helicopter Sunday. McLeish could celebrate his second, and Rangers' 51st, league title. The 2005–06 season got off to a bad start, with Rangers only winning six league games out of the first 17, being knocked out of the League Cup by Celtic in the process. The period from October through to early December saw the team embark on, statistically, the worst run in their history, going ten games without a win. During this time, however, the club became the first Scottish side to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League, yet there was still significant pressure on McLeish from fans due to the club's poor position in the domestic league table. It was widely felt that chairman David Murray would let McLeish go after the European campaign had finished, and a press conference arranged two days after the final group match seemed to confirm this. However, Murray seemed to undergo a change of heart and stated that McLeish would remain in charge indefinitely, but did concede that domestic results would need to improve. After this announcement, the team improved, helped by the signing from Kilmarnock of Kris Boyd. The side strung together a ten-match unbeaten run. Yet, entering the crucial month of February, which was to feature a must-win Old Firm match and the resumption of European football, this evaporated. Rangers lost 3–0 at home to Hibernian on 4 February to exit the Scottish Cup and end their last realistic hopes of silverware that season. Protests against McLeish and the chairman followed the game. Overall, McLeish's four-and-a-half-year spell at Ibrox was a turbulent one, coming as it did after the wastefulness of the Advocaat era. McLeish never enjoyed access to the funds his predecessors had been given, and his managership was marked by wildly fluctuating fortunes, in part caused by forced asset stripping of his best players due to the spectre of debt from Advocaat's spending. The lack of money certainly played its part in McLeish's downfall but it is debatable, based on the money he did have to spend, whether greater sums would have been invested wisely. Indeed, there is an argument that a good proportion of McLeish's signings have been among the worst in the club's entire history. However, history will look back on McLeish's reign, as a period of tremendous transition on and off the pitch. Paul Le Guen (2006–2007) After signs that supporter unrest was turning on Murray, on 9 February 2006, two days before the crucial Old Firm match, it was announced that McLeish would leave his position as manager at the end of the 2005–06 season, and on 11 March, it was confirmed that former Lyon manager Paul Le Guen would succeed him at the end of the season. Murray predicted a fruitful reign under Le Guen, describing his capture as \\"a massive moonbeam of success\\" for the club and promising, \\"we’ve got big plans.\\"\\"Murray’s moonbeam vision doomed to destruction right from the outset\\" The Times (1 August 2007) He announced that the Frenchman would be given significant funds with which to strengthen the squad, with Rangers having announced an arrangement with sports retailer JJB Sports. Le Guen was well known for unearthing and nurturing young talent and made an immediate splash in the transfer market. The wave of expectation that was created by Le Guen's appointment was immense and he quickly went about building his own team. In the summer of 2006 he made eleven signings (of them only Saša Papac would be playing for the club the following season). Le Guen spent big money on Filip Šebo, which proved to be wasted as the Slovakian only netted twice during the whole campaign. Other signings including Karl Svensson, Libor Sionko and Lionel Letizi simply did not perform, while Jérémy Clément was to be in Glasgow for only six months. He signed a young South African player Dean Furman from Chelsea, and French youngsters William Stanger and Antoine Ponroy from Rennes. He allowed more experienced players to leave, Alex Rae, Sotirios Kyrgiakos, Peter Løvenkrands and Ronald Waterreus. right Rangers' first match under Le Guen was a friendly against Irish Premier League champions Linfield on 6 July 2006 at Windsor Park, Belfast. The side won 2–0 with first-half goals from Kris Boyd and Thomas Buffel. The squad then flew out to South Africa on 9 July for a training camp where they were to play three matches, but defender Fernando Ricksen did not take any part in the tour of South Africa due to what was described by the club as \\"unacceptable behaviour\\" on the flight to Johannesburg. He returned to Scotland and was subsequently loaned to Zenit St Petersburg on 9 August. Ricksen never played for the club again as his loan spell in Russia was made permanent. The Scottish Premier League season opened on 30 July with Le Guen taking his Rangers side to Fir Park where they defeated Motherwell 2–1. In Le Guen's first competitive game at Ibrox, Rangers were held to a 2–2 draw by Dundee United, and were forced to come back from two goals down. On 11 August Rangers signed Manchester United's then 19-year- old winger Lee Martin on loan for a season. Rangers also recruited the services of Austrian Vienna defender Saša Papac while Marvin Andrews, Olivier Bernard, Robert Malcolm and José-Karl Pierre-Fanfan all departed. With the transfer window closed and five league matches played, Rangers had collected nine points from fifteen. The following two months showed little improvement as the side had sporadic wins and lost the first Old Firm match of the season 2–0. From the seven matches played in September and October 2006, the team won just three and gathered ten points from the twenty-one available. By mid November, Rangers found themselves in third place, a full fifteen points behind leaders Celtic. The odd win was mixed with regular dropped points as the team struggled to find consistency in the early part of the season. The culmination of this poor form could be seen when the side was embarrassingly knocked out of the League Cup by then First Division side St Johnstone. A dismal 2–0 defeat at Ibrox Stadium on 8 November led to widespread calls for Le Guen to leave.\\"Rangers 0–2 St Johnstone\\" BBC Sport. 8 November 2006.\\"Le Guen sorry for Rangers defeat\\" BBC Sport. 9 November 2006. Following the League Cup defeat, there was a slightly gain in form as the side claimed sixteen points from twenty-one, including a 1–1 Old Firm draw thanks to a late-minute Brahim Hemdani equaliser. Rangers also became the first Scottish club to qualify from the UEFA Cup group stage in December 2006, after wins over Livorno, Maccabi Haifa and Partizan Belgrade. Domestic results and performances, however, continued to be inconsistent and in January 2007, Le Guen controversially stripped midfielder Barry Ferguson of the captaincy On 4 January 2007, Le Guen left Rangers by mutual consent. This made him the club's shortest-serving manager, and the only one to leave the club without completing a full season in charge. Later that year, sports journalist Graham Spiers published a book which speculated Le Guen left the club because he was being \\"undermined\\" by other Rangers personnel. Those named were Ferguson and the then club doctor, Ian McGuinness.Paul Le Guen: Enigma – A Chronicle of Trauma and Turmoil at Rangers , Random House, Smith's return (2007–2011) Following the departure of Paul Le Guen, a number of media sources reported an \\"understanding\\" that the new management structure would consist of former Rangers manager Walter Smith and former player Ally McCoist, and the SFA confirmed that Rangers enquired about the availability of the pair. However, on 8 January, the SFA rebuffed Rangers' approach for Smith. On 10 January 2007, it was announced that Walter Smith was the new manager of Rangers, with Ally McCoist confirmed as assistant manager and Kenny McDowall as first team coach. Smith and his team undertook some serious surgery to the side. He signed experienced defenders David Weir, Ugo Ehiogu and Andy Webster to shore up the rocky backline. This proved to be a steadying influence on the team and they only lost three times until the end of the season, although Webster injured himself during his first training session at the club and did not make his debut until September 2007. Alan Hutton takes on Barcelona left back Eric Abidal during the match at the Camp Nou. The following summer, Smith made ten signings, including defender Carlos Cuéllar and midfielder Lee McCulloch. The early season priority, qualification for the Champions League group stage, was secured after aggregate victories over the champions of the Montenegrin and Serbian leagues, FK Zeta and Red Star Belgrade respectively. Rangers were drawn in Group E, to play FC Barcelona, French champions Olympique Lyonnais and German champions VfB Stuttgart. The campaign started well for Rangers with two victories, 2–1 at home to Stuttgart and 3–0 against Lyon at the Stade Gerland as well as a 0–0 draw against Barcelona at Ibrox Stadium. They lost match day six against Olympique Lyonnais 3–0, which ended their 2007–08 UEFA Champions League run. The adventure continued as they progressed to the final of the UEFA Cup, defeating Panathinaikos, Werder Bremen, Sporting Lisbon and Fiorentina along the way. They beat Italian side Fiorentina on penalties to set up a final, in Manchester, against Zenit St. Petersburg, who are managed by former Gers manager Dick Advocaat. The team lost that match 2–0, amid serious disturbances caused by small sections of the 100,000-strong Rangers support. Video evidence was released by the Greater Manchester Police of suspected Rangers fans attacking officers in Manchester city centre following the defeat.BBC News CCTV shows fans chasing police BBC News. 15 May 2008. An appeal was launched on BBC's Crimewatch program in January 2009 in an attempt to trace 49 men in connection with the riots. On the domestic front, the race for the Scottish Premier League continued until the final match-day of the season. Both Celtic and Rangers were tied on 86 points going into their games (against Dundee United and Aberdeen respectively) on 22 May 2008, but Celtic were top of the table due to having a better goal difference of 57, four ahead of Rangers. This did not prove to be decisive, as Rangers surrendered their hopes of landing the championship with a 2–0 defeat away to the Dons. The club had had a ten-point lead in late March. The club appeared in its first final since 2005. They played Dundee United on 16 March 2008 and won the League Cup on penalties. The match was tied 2–2 after extra time, with both goals coming from Kris Boyd who also scored the winning spot kick. They also reached the 2009 Scottish Cup Final, the club's 50th appearance in a Scottish Cup final. The side had beaten St Johnstone 4–3 on penalties in the semi-final after the score was tied at 1–1 after extra time. The final was against Queen of the South and played on 24 May 2008. Rangers won the match 3–2 thanks to goals from DaMarcus Beasley and a double from Kris Boyd. The 2008–09 season began disastrously as the club exited the UEFA Champions League and European football altogether, losing 2–1 on aggregate to Lithuanian side FBK Kaunas in the second qualifying round. The first leg at Ibrox finished goalless, but the return leg ended in defeat for Rangers after an 87th-minute header from Linas Pilibaitis. The financial consequences of the failures to qualify for the Champions League were revealed when the club posted a loss of £3.9 million for the six months to December 2008, and in March decided to offer staff the option of voluntary redundancy as a way of cutting costs. There was also mounting pressure on the manager to reduce the first team squad from 28 players to a more manageable figure. The player excess was eased slightly with the departures of Chris Burke, Jean-Claude Darcheville and a couple out on loan deals but the increased debt meant that the club needed to find a cash injection. This resulted in the attempted sale of Kris Boyd to Birmingham City, which fell through due to the player's wage demands.\\"Blues end bid to sign Gers' Boyd\\" BBC Sport (8 January 2009) In the first Old Firm game of the season, Rangers won 4–2, with Pedro Mendes scoring his first goal for the club, and Kenny Miller scoring a double against his former employers. However, the team's league form stuttered thereafter. Despite a run of five wins from six matches following the Old Firm victory, the side trailed Celtic by seven points in the league at the turn of the year. For the first few months of 2009' both sides dropped and gained points on the other and Rangers briefly took over top spot of the Scottish Premier League on 21 February after a win against Kilmarnock. The spell as league leaders lasted less than a fortnight. A defeat and a draw, both at home, to Inverness and Hearts respectively, saw Smith's side sit second in the table, one point behind Celtic, at the split. The fourth Old Firm league meeting of the season finished with a 1–0 win to Rangers, thanks to a Steven Davis strike. This meant that, with three league games remaining, Rangers were two points ahead of Celtic. Further twists and turns followed, both Old Firm sides drew their matches against Hibernian at Easter Road, and so Rangers were ahead by two points with one round of matches remaining. Smith's side just needed a win against Dundee United to guarantee the club's 52nd league title. That is exactly what they got, goals from Kyle Lafferty, Pedro Mendes and Kris Boyd sealed a 3–0 win and the club's first league championship in four seasons.\\"Dundee United 0–3 Rangers\\" BBC Sport (24 May 2009) The club played in the finals of both of the domestic cup competitions for the second season running. The 2009 Scottish League Cup Final was reached by defeating Partick Thistle, Hamilton and Falkirk en route but the final ended in a 2–0 defeat at the hands of Old Firm rivals Celtic after extra time. The match was Walter Smith's first ever Old Firm final and was marred by a Kirk Broadfoot sending off deep into extra time for a foul on Aiden McGeady inside the penalty box. Celtic were subsequently awarded a penalty which McGeady himself converted. Rangers qualified for the 2009 Scottish Cup Final after beating St Mirren 3–0 in the semi-final. The second goal of the game was scored by Kris Boyd and was his 100th goal for Rangers. The team faced Falkirk at Hampden Park on 30 May 2009 in what was the club's 51st Scottish Cup Final appearance. A Nacho Novo strike in the first minute of the second half gave Rangers a 1–0 win and completed the domestic double.\\"Rangers 1–0 Falkirk\\" BBC Sport (30 May 2009) The following season saw Rangers financial problems continue. A quiet summer in terms of transfer arrivals contrasted to the outgoings. The club removed eleven players who had made first team appearances from the wage bill on permanent and loan deals. The only addition to the playing staff was Jérôme Rothen on a season loan, Rothen was the first player to sign for the club in over a year.\\"Rangers tie up Rothen deal\\" BBC Sport (1 September 2009) On 26 August, chairman David Murray stepped down and was replaced by non-executive director Alastair Johnston.

On the field, Rangers' Scottish Premier League title defence got off to a stuttering start, three wins in the league was followed by three draws, the first Old Firm victory of the season was followed by poor performances against St Johnstone and dropped points at home to Hibernian. The side lost their first league match of the season away to Aberdeen on 28 November but then embarked on a six match winning run, scoring 26 goals in the process. At the start of 2010, Rangers sat at the top of the league. The second Old Firm fixture finished in a 1–1 draw. Rangers had a ten-point lead by mid-February. Rangers won the third Old Firm match 1–0 thanks to an injury time winner from Maurice Edu which all but secured the title. The side had to wait nearly two months to be confirmed as champions due to dropping points to St Johnstone and Dundee United. On 25 April, Rangers won their 53rd league title after defeating Hibernian 1–0 at Easter Road. In the domestic cup competitions, Rangers won the League Cup after a 1–0 victory over St Mirren in the final, despite being reduced to nine men with Danny Wilson and Kevin Thomson being sent off. However, Rangers were unable to retain the Scottish Cup after losing 1–0 to eventual winners Dundee United in a quarter- final replay. Rangers were seeded in pot two of the UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time. The club was drawn against Spanish team Sevilla, German outfit Stuttgart and Romanian champions Unirea Urziceni. A 1–1 away draw in Germany was followed by two consecutive 4–1 defeats at home to Sevilla and Unirea, the latter being regarded as one of the club's worst-ever European results.\\"Walter Smith urges Rangers to avenge 'worst ever' defeat\\" guardian.co.uk (3 November 2009)\\"Rangers suffer their worst humiliation\\" The Scotsman. 21 October 2009. Rangers were left with a small chance of qualifying from the group after a 1–1 draw in the return leg with Unirea, a match that saw trouble in the Rangers fans section of the stadium. The club was charged by UEFA for inappropriate conduct\\"Rangers charged over fan violence\\" BBC Sport (5 November 2009) and following an investigation fined €20,000 plus ordered to pay the cost of repairing the damage to the stadium infrastructure caused by its supporters.\\"Rangers and Unirea fined by Uefa\\" BBC Sport. 12 November 2009. The side finished bottom of their group and was knocked out of European football altogether after two defeats in the final two matches. With financial problems at the club ongoing, summer 2010 began for Rangers with several players leaving the club. With a limited transfer budget and a small squad. Smith had to decide whether to increase the number of playing staff or improve the starting eleven; he opted for quality. Both sides of the Old Firm began the season with eight league wins in a row, however, with the sides meeting on matchday nine something had to give. Rangers claimed a 3–1 victory over Celtic and took early control of the league. A 1–1 draw at home to Inverness CT the following weekend ended Rangers 100% start to the season and a home defeat by Hibernian inflicted the team's first league defeat of the season, the first of five. The cold spell in the winter of 2010–11 saw many postponements and for long spells Rangers were behind Celtic but with games in hand. In the third league meeting between the Old Firm, Celtic came out on top and mathematical lead the table, for the first time that season. However Celtic's advantage was short lived after a loss to Motherwell the following week. This allowed Rangers to regain top spot, but 3–2 loss to Dundee United at Ibrox followed by a 0–0 draw in the final Old Firm fixture left the title in Celtic's hands, with just four matches remaining. There was to be a final twist in the league season; on 3 May, Celtic lost a rearranged match away to Inverness and so with three matches remaining Rangers had a one-point lead. Smith's side went on to win all three fixtures, scoring 11 goals, and claimed the club's 54th league championship. In the domestic cup competitions, Rangers won the League Cup after beating Celtic 2-1 AET. However, Rangers lost 1–0 to Celtic in the fifth round replay in Scottish Cup. The match was marked by several incidents, three Rangers players were sent off and Celtic manager Neil Lennon and Ally McCoist were involved in a bust-up. In Europe, Rangers automatically qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stages for the second season in a row. They drew Manchester United, Valencia and Bursaspor. Rangers were unbeaten in their first three group stage games, with a 0–0 draw at Old Trafford (the only team to keep a clean sheet at Old Trafford in the entire 2010–11 season), a 1–0 victory over Bursaspor at Ibrox and a 1–1 draw at home to Valencia. A 3–0 defeat in Spain to Valencia followed by a 1–0 loss at home to Manchester United ended Rangers chances of qualifying for the last 16, but third place and a spot in the UEFA Europa League was already secured with Bursaspor having failed to pick up a point in five games. In the last group match, Rangers drew 1–1 in Turkey, giving Bursaspor their first Champions League point. However, Rangers did make it to the last 16 of the Europa League, beating Sporting Lisbon on away goals in the last 32 but lost to PSV Eindhoven on aggregate. On 6 May 2011, it was confirmed that David Murray had sold his controlling interest in the club (85.3%) for £1 to Wavetower Limited, a company ultimately owned by businessman Craig Whyte. McCoist's tenure, liquidation and relaunch (2011–2015) Smith's deputy and Rangers record goalscorer Ally McCoist was appointed manager of the club for season 2011–12. Hampered by a bizarre transfer policy under Whyte, Rangers found themselves knocked out of first the UEFA Champions League and then the UEFA Europa League by the end of August, depriving the club of income that may have been anticipated. With the new ownership there initially appeared to be some financial stability of the club. A number of first-team regulars were secured on long-term contract extensions including Steven Davis, Allan McGregor, Steven Whittaker and Gregg Wylde. When McCoist entered the transfer market, his first signing being Almería midfielder Juan Manuel Ortiz, he soon encountered difficulties. A number of highly publicised failed transfers, including deals for Wesley Verhoek and Roland Juhász, lead to many doubting Whyte's financial prowess. Rangers' first Scottish Premier League match of the season was a home match against Jim Jefferies' Hearts, where the league flag was unfurled by then chairman Craig Whyte, as Rangers were under considerable pressure for most of the first half but managed to salvage a draw. The following week, McCoist claimed his first competitive victory as manager with a win over St Johnstone. The season proved to be a baptism of fire for McCoist, by early October the club held a ten- point lead over Celtic, and on 5 November the lead stood at fifteen points over Celtic and twelve over second placed Motherwell. However, a draw with St Johnstone and subsequent defeats to Kilmarnock, St Mirren and Old Firm rivals Celtic, who then went on a run of twenty-one matches undefeated saw Rangers slip to second place where the club remained for the rest of the season. Rangers' European adventure began in the middle of the final week of July, where Rangers were defeated by underdogs Malmö 1-0 at home and Rangers crashed out of the Champions League with a bad tempered 1–1 draw in Sweden in which both Steven Whittaker and Madjid Bougherra were both given their marching orders, and ultimately relegating the Gers to the Europa League play-off round, where they faced Slovenian team NK Maribor. In cup competitions the club fared no better, a third round defeat by First Division side Falkirk in the League Cup and a fifth round exit at home to Dundee United. On 13 February 2012, Rangers filed legal papers at the Court of Session giving notice of their intention to appoint administrators. Rangers officially entered administration on the following day, and appointed London-based financial advisers Duff & Phelps as administrators. Rangers entered administration over an alleged non-payment of £9m in PAYE and VAT taxes to HM Revenue and Customs. On entering administration, the team was docked ten points by the SPL, a move regarded as 'effectively ending' its 2012 championship challenge. A failure then to submit accounts for 2011 meant the club was not granted a licence to play in European football in season 2012–13. In April it was reported that the club's total debts could be as high as £134m. On 13 May it was reported that Whyte sold his controlling interest in The Rangers Football Club Plc for £2 to a consortium led by Charles Green. Green offered the creditors a settlement, in the form of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), in an attempt to exit administration. On 12 June 2012, it emerged that HMRC would reject the CVA put forward by Green. Green's takeover of the club depended on the CVA being accepted by HMRC, which would have seen £8.5m of the total debt repaid. The formal rejection of the CVA, two days later, meant that The Rangers Football Club plc entered the liquidation process. The company's business and assets were sold to a company called Sevco Scotland Ltd, a consortium led by Green, in a deal worth £5.5m. Sevco was subsequently renamed The Rangers Football Club Ltd at the end of July 2012.Rangers crisis: Dave King flies into Glasgow to hold talks over newco club STV TV, 18 June 2012 Ten of the other eleven SPL clubs voted against allowing Rangers to transfer their SPL membership share to a new company on 4 July 2012, leaving the club applying for a place in the Scottish Football League. On 13 July 29 out of 30 SFL member clubs voted to give Rangers associate membership but 25 of them also voted to place Rangers FC into the Third Division of the Irn-Bru Scottish Football League from the start of the season. Rangers clinched the Scottish Third Division Title on 30 March after a goalless draw away to Montrose and Queen's Park lost. Apart from being defeated 2–1 by Forfar in the First Round of the League Cup on 3 August, season 2013/14 got off to an excellent start with Rangers winning maximum league points in their first 15 games in League One.Rangers 6:1 Ayr bbc.co.uk, 7 December 2013 2014 was a mixed bag for Rangers FC. They went on to the Ramsden's Cup Final where they were beaten by Raith Rovers. On 3 May 2014, Rangers players made history by becoming the first Rangers side in 115 years to go an entire league season unbeaten after a 1–1 draw with Dunfermline, finishing as Scottish League One champions. Rangers boardroom politics were a fractious force, causing a constant flux with change after change of various directorial positions, rival factions attempting to take control of the company and the emergence of Mike Ashley as the major stakeholder and power broker in late 2014. That summer saw continued discontent with various fans groups, alongside Dave King, attempting to influence the board by withdrawing season ticket money. This resulted in a drop of around 15,000 season tickets from the previous season, leaving the club requiring a financial injection which the board hoped would come from a share issue and announced this in June. However, the initial intention of raising up to £10m through an investment plan by the end of August failed when city investors did not purchase enough shares, therefore, the club relaunched a £4m issue open to all existing shareholders only. Rangers fan discontent was demonstrated with a during a Championship game against Queen of the South at Ibrox, with fans holding up red cards in the 18th and 72nd minutes and this was not improved when, on 3 September, it was reported that Mike Ashley bought the naming rights to Ibrox Stadium for just £1 in a deal with Charles Green in 2012. Concurrently, Rangers former commercial director Imran Ahmad finally succeeded in a bid to have £620,000 of club assets frozen prior to pursuing litigation over an alleged unpaid £500,000 bonus. A few days later the club were granted leave to appeal this decision yet, on 12 September, the club agreed to a settlement with Ahmad much to the dismayed of fans. As some Rangers supporters groups considered boycotting home matches in protest at the board, it was reported that Ashley would not be participating in the share offer. Ashley's motives for not investing became clear in the following month, namely withholding much needed money from the club in order to undermine the board. At the end of the share issue, on 12 September, it was announced that it had raised just over £3m which still £1m short of its minimum target. As the share issue was undertaken in order to allow Rangers to continue to operate into the new year but the failure to reach the targets meant that further funding was required. A few days later, it came to light that Sandy Easdale had met with several investors that had been introduced to him by Rafat Rizvi, a convicted fraudster wanted by Interpol, which led to calls by the Union of Fans for Easdale to resign. However, in a move to demonstrate his strength, Easdale increased his personal shareholding at Rangers to 5.21% on 24 September. On the same day as the club repaid the £1.5m loan to Sandy Easdale and George Letham. The next day, BNP Paribas bought a 5% stake in Rangers making it the fifth-highest shareholder but less than 24 later it was reported that the transaction was completed on Ashley's behalf, thus increasing his stake to 8.92%. Less than a week later, Ashley's holding company, MASH Holdings, called for an EGM to remove chief executive Wallace. This signaled the start of a crucial stage in the boardroom power struggle at Rangers with King appearing to be outflanked by Ashley, who had secured the support of Sandy Easdale, David Sommers as well as the largest shareholder in Rangers, Laxey Partners. When offers of funding from Dave King, a £16m package, and Brian Kennedy were rejected by Rangers’ hierarchy, who instead opted Mike Ashley's £2m loan offer, it was clear who was victorious. Particularly as Ashley's initial offer was insufficient and he had to be provide another £1m of funding less than a month later. In exchange for the initial funding, Ashley was granted critical power at the club with the privilege to put forward the names of two nominees for appointment to the board as well as security over Edmiston House and the Albion car park. As a consequence of his power grab both Philip Nash and Graham Wallace were forced out of the club and Derek Llambias and Barry Leach were brought in, initially as consultants before being appointed Chief executive and Finance director respectively. Also David Somers was named executive chairman but on a temporary basis in order to aid the transition. Financial respite was short lived as Rangers announced its preliminary results at the end of November indicating the club required another £8m of investment to see out the season. This effectively left Rangers at the mercy of Ashley who could dictate the terms of and source of any future funding. Due to this power, the Scottish Football Association issued Ashley with a notice of complaint for breached a joint agreement that Ashley would not play a controlling role in Rangers and would maintain a stake of no more than 10%. As Ashley had previously loaned the club £2m and a further £1m as well as having two directors on the Rangers board and a significant interest in Rangers retail operations, although, he did return the naming rights to Ibrox Stadium to Rangers. On Christmas Eve, the SFA denied him permission to increase his stake-hold in Rangers further. Also in December, the Scottish Professional Football League added to Rangers financial woes by withholding £250,000 of broadcast money the club was due in a bid to recoup a fine imposed by the Nimmo Smith Commission. The legal implications of the previous company that owned the club's liquidation featured prevalent in the news in July and November. In the summer, HM Revenue and Customs lost its appeal over the previous club's owners use of Employee Benefit Trusts but was granted leave to appeal a month later. Meanwhile, Rangers former chairman Craig Whyte was banned from being a company director for 15 years in September and a warrant was issued for his arrest a month later, he appeared in court facing charges under the Companies Act but was released on bail. Four men have appeared in court charged with fraudulent activity following a probe into the sale of Rangers in 2011. David Grier, Paul Clark and David Whitehouse (both administrators working for Duff & Phelps), and Gary Withey (a solicitor for Collyer Bristow) made no plea or declaration at Glasgow Sheriff Court and were granted bail. Meanwhile, the liquidators of Rangers former owners secured a £24m payment from Collyer Bristow, the lawyers who acted for Whyte when he bought the club. On the football front, Rangers league campaign began with a defeat to newly-relegated Hearts with the Edinburgh club scoring an extra minute winner. Despite embarking on a nine-game unbeaten run in all competitions, a loss at home to Hibernian left the side trailing Hearts by six-points at the top of the league by the end of September. Better news for Rangers was the reaching of the League Cup semi-final after a 1–0 win over St Johnstone, being drawn against Celtic which set up the first Old Firm derby in two years. Nevertheless, the club's title charge was effectively ended in November as the side lost a six-pointer match away to league leaders Hearts leaving them nine points behind. The did bounce back the following week in the Scottish Cup registering a 3–0 win over Scottish Premiership side Kilmarnock, however, in the club's third cup competition the team surrendered a 2–0 lead to lose 3–2 to fellow Championship team Alloa Athletic in the Challenge Cup. Even with the poor league form and exit in the Challenge Cup, there was no indication of significant pressure on manager Ally McCoist. The effect of the club's financial issues as underlined by the interim results that November, proved the catalyst for McCoist's departure as he became unhappy with the number of staff losing their jobs at Rangers. The situation became too much for McCoist and he tendered his resignation on 12 December which was later confirmed to the London Stock Exchange by the club three days later, with McCoist beginning a 12-month notice period. However, he was to serve less than a week of his notice period before being placed on gardening leave by the board, with his assistant manager Kenny McDowall being appointed interim manager until the end of the season. Boardroom changes and top tier return (2015–) The start of 2015 saw Ashley's control over Rangers weakened as deals were made with a consortium led by Dave King, to purchase the shareholding of Laxey Partners which had stood at 16%. King took control of a 14.57% stake and two weeks later called for an EGM on 16 January. The original date was set by the board was 4 March in a hotel in London, however, this was then moved to Ibrox Stadium after two successive hotels refused to host the event and the date was confirmed for 6 March. During the run up to the EGM, the incumbent Rangers board agreed £10m funding deal with Sports Direct. The agreement saw Sports Direct hold a floating charge over Murray Park, Edmiston House, the Albion Car Park and the club's registered trademarks. Sports Direct was also transferred 26% of Rangers' share in Rangers Retail Limited (Rangers previously held 51% with Sports Direct holding 49%). The club were bound to forego all shirt sponsorship revenue for the 2016-17 season and subsequent seasons until the loan is repaid. On transfer deadline day, Rangers also loaned five players from Newcastle United, a Premier League club that Ashley owns. The month of February a large volume of share purchase and Rangers supporters groups are heavily involved. With the writing apparently on the wall, Rangers director James Easdale resigned just over a week before the EGM and chairman Somers departed with fours days to go. The SFA's investigation into Ashley concluded at the beginning of March with Ashley being deemed to have broken rules on dual ownership due to his influence on the affairs of Rangers, he was fined £7,500, and Rangers were subsequently fined £5,500 over a month later for their lack of governance. Just two days before the EGM, the club's Nominated adviser, WH Ireland, resigned resulting shares in the Plc being suspended. The outcome of the EGM was a decisive victory for King's consortium with Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach being voted off the board and King, Paul Murray and John Giligan moving in. Both King and Murray subsequently applied to be passed as a fit and proper person by the SFA with the later being cleared at the beginning of May. Further board appointments were made with John Bennett and Chris Graham added to the Plc board as non-executive directors and James Blair was appointed company secretary, however, Graham resigned his directorship only three days later. On the same day as the appointments Rangers suspended Llambias, Leach and Sandy Easdale from its football club board pending an internal investigation. After poor results in both league and Scottish Cup, Stuart McCall replaced Kenny McDowall as interim manager. At the end of March it was revealed that Rangers five loan signings from Newcastle United were signed without medicals. On same day as interim accounts were published, 31 March, it emerged that Rangers would have owed Newcastle United £500,000 if they were promoted due to the agreement struck when loaning the players. It was announced on 2 April that Rangers would be de-listed from the AIM stock exchange after failing to find a Nominated adviser within the required period. The SPFL courted controversy with the final day fixtures by moving the Rangers v Hearts match from Saturday to Sunday, with the rest of the matches proceeding on the Saturday. This could have given Rangers a possible advantage in the chase for second place, however, the SPFL performed a U-turn, with all matches being scheduled for early Saturday afternoon As it was, the team failed to be automatically promoted to the Premiership, drawing the final two league matches and finishing a disappointing third in the league. This meant the club faced at least six play-off matches in order to gain promotion. The ticket pricing of these matches attracted controversy. Following a precedent set by Hibernian the previous season, Rangers stated they would allow season ticket holders entry to home matches for free; however, this was rejected by the SPFL. Not to be deterred, Rangers then announced a blanket £5 ticket price offer for all seats. The side successfully negotiated two play-off rounds before crashing to a 6-1 aggregate defeat to premiership team Motherwell. The second leg of the play-off final ended in controversy as Rangers Bilel Mohsni and Motherwell's Lee Erwin brawled on the pitch after the match as Motherwell fans invade the pitch to goad the Rangers fans. Meanwhile, the police probed the role of Mike Ashley and Sports Direct in the Rangers takeover and searched the companies headquarters. This was rumored to be the reason that Ashley demanded the repayment of his £5m loan to the club. Rangers set the date of the general meeting for June 2015 and added its own resolutions and proposals. On 19 May King was passed fit and proper by the SFA and became Chairman of the club on 22 May. On the same day King also loaned the club an additional £1.5m and a day later, Rangers legend John Greig was named honorary president of the club on 23 May. =2015–16 season= In early June, Ibrox Stadium played host to the company's second EGM in just over three months. A majority of shareholders voted in favour of a board resolution to renegotiate existing retail agreements with Sports Direct and voted against the early repayment of a loan from Mike Ashley. Rangers made further appointments to the broad with Stewart Robertson joining as managing director and Andrew Dickinson being promoted to financial director. The spectre of the previous board loomed large at the beginning of the season as Police Scotland's investigation into the sale of Rangers' assets to a consortium led by Charles Green led to arrests and seven indictments. On 1 September, both Craig Whyte and Green were arrested as part of the inquiry into the \\"alleged fraudulent acquisition\\" of Rangers' assets in 2012. Just over two weeks later indictments were served on seven accused, including Green and Whyte, David Whitehouse, Paul Clark, David Grier, who were all working for administrators Duff and Phelps at the time, Gary Withey who worked for a law firm involved in the purchase of Rangers by Whyte and Imran Ahmad, a former Rangers commercial director. Indeed, the latter indidcated that he would not co-operate with the proceedings, subsequently a warrant was issued for his arrest and charges against him were temporarily stopped. A week later, Green took the company to the Court of Session in an attempt to force the PLC to pay his legal fees with regards to the forthcoming trial, however, the action was dismissed by Lord Doherty a few months later and an appeal to the Inner House was also refused in March 2016. On 30 October, Rangers announced it was not appropriate to proceed with a share issue and listing on the ISDX market until the criminal proceedings being brought against Charles Green, Imran Ahmed, Craig Whyte and others was concluded. On 5 February 2016, prosecutors have withdrawn six of 15 charges brought against six men in the alleged Rangers fraud case which resulted in all charges against Duff and Phelps administrators David Whitehouse and Paul Clark being dropped, although prosecutors indicated there would be filing fresh charges against the pair. Charges against Green were also dropped meaning that the former chief executive of the club was not facing any. A few months later, in May 2016, it was announced that charges against Gary Withey and David Grier were dropped and they would not stand trial alongside former Rangers owner Craig Whyte, the only person still facing charges. Fireworks night 2015 arrived a day early in Govan as 4 November proved to be a contentious day in the history of Rangers. The club's PLC owner, Rangers International Football Club, announced a loss of £7.5m for the year ending June 2015. This meant the company was required to find approximately £2.5m in order to cover expenses for the rest of the season. Moreover, the outcome of HMRC's appeal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal regarding the previous owner and its use of EBT's. The Court of Session ruled that the use of Employee Benefit Trusts broke tax rules therefore the payments were eligible for tax deductions, although an appeal to the Supreme Court was sought less than a month later and granted in March 2016. This judgement caused debate in Scottish football as many people erroneously believed the decision made by the Nimmo Smith commission not to strip Rangers of titles was based on the outcome of the tax case. Coincidentally, the Commission's ruling was taken to an arbitration tribunal by the club's owners with RIFC PLC disputing its liability for the £250,000 fine plus £150,000 in additional costs, imposed on the company that previous owned the club. The SPFL subsequently imposed this on the new owners of the club as part of the terms of the five way agreement. However, an independent SFA tribunal ruled that RIFC PLC was liable for the fine in March 2016. Further legal matters occurred a week later, although not directly involving Rangers, as Mike Ashley lodged a challenge to the SFA's decision to pass King as a fit and proper person by seeking a Judicial review, however, the litigation was abandoned in April 2016 after his legal team received information about King's finances which the SFA used in their fit and proper deliberations. Ashley had also raised court proceedings against Dave King, accusing him of breaching a court injunction regarding the commercial agreements between Rangers and Sports Direct, however, the Royal Courts of Justice dismissed the motion for him to be jailed, moreover, a further accusation that King committed contempt of court was cleared. In the end, the court action against King was discontinued by Sports Direct as the company halted litigation claiming a breach of confidentiality in relation to a commercial deal, in which the Judge called \\"ridiculous\\". The end of November saw the PLC's Annual general meeting, however, prior to this Mike Ashley continued with his ligation against the company and successfully managed to have Resolution 11 withdrawn which would have allowed shareholders to block the voting rights of dual ownership shareholders. The AGM passed without major incident however, the Chairman Dave King announced the adoption of the Living wage for company employees and the repayment of a £5m loan from Ashley's Sports Direct. Although on 11 December, it was reported that the company had not repaid the £5m loan despite earlier claims to the contrary. That same day it was reported that former Rangers player Arnold Peralta had been shot dead in his hometown of La Ceiba, Honduras. On Christmas Eve Rangers announced that the loan had been repaid to Ashley in full and it was later revealed, on Ne'erday, that Rangers had borrowed £6.5m from King an others in order to do this. On 4 February, it was announced by the Rangers board that they had given Sports Direct formal notice that they wish to end their retail deal for club merchandise. On 18 May, Rangers indicated its intention to end the joint venture with Sports Direct for selling club kits and merchandise, this included the withdrawal of the rights to use club trademarks. On the football front, Rangers appointed its fourteenth permanent manager on 15 June in the shape of Mark Warburton, who agreed a three-year contract. Warburton was joined at the club by former Rangers centre-back David Weir who became his assistant manager. The start to the season saw Rangers embark on a run of eleven straight victories in all competitions. This helped Warburton overtake former Rangers manager Bill Struth's record of eight consecutive wins by a manager at the beginning of there Ibrox career. Ultimately, this would could not continue, the series of victories came to an abrupt halt in mid-September as the club suffered a 3–1 defeat to St Johnstone in the League Cup. Despite this, Rangers league form continued to impress with the team continuing a winning steak for the first eleven games of the season which gave the club an eight-point lead, over second place Hibernian, at the top of the table by late October. However, the side was to go through a poor run of form thereafter collecting eight points from a possible eighteen over the next six league games including two defeats to Hibernian and Falkirk respectively. This left Rangers tied with the Edinburgh club on forty-one points ahead of crucial match between the two during the festive period. Rangers played Hibernian on 28 December at Ibrox, beating Alan Stubbs' side 4-2 then embarked on an unbeaten run of ten matches, winning nine with only Alloa Athletic managing to get a draw. Alongside this rich vain of form, second placed Hibernian suffered a run of three defeats within a week to see them trail Rangers at the top of the table by fourteen points as the season entered March. The league crown was secured for Rangers on 5 April at Ibrox and formed the first part of a brace of trophies within a week. The team qualified for its second Challenge Cup final in the space of three years with the match being played at Hampden Park for the first time in the competition's history. The match was played in front of a near sell out as Rangers ran out 4–0 winners over Scottish League One side Peterhead on 10 April. Similarly, in Scottish Cup, the club reached its second semi-final in three seasons, setting up the first Old Firm derby in over a year. A highly anticipated match ended with both sides tied after full and extra time with Rangers winning the penalty shoot-out to progress to the final. The semi-final heroics were ultimately for nothing as Rangers lost the 2016 Scottish Cup Final to Hibernian with the Edinburgh club scoring an injury time winner. However, their victory was marred by a pitch invasion by Hibernian fans at the full-time whistle. The SFA has said it is \\"appalled\\" by scenes of disorder and set-up a commission to review operational failings apparent from the day. Police Scotland also investigated the matter which included assaults on Rangers players and staff. =2016–17 season= The football department's scouting network was revitalized with the appointment of Frank McParland as the Head of Recruitment. On 18 December, Rangers announced a coaching and development partnership with Scottish Lowland League club Gala Fairydean Rovers which effectivelty saw the Galashiels side act as a feeder to Rangers. The club's pre-season plans were confirmed in May with the first- team's squad travelling to the United States for a training camp which incorporated a friendly match against United Soccer League side Charleston Battery. The fallout from the 2016 Scottish Cup Final fan violence continued with the SFA announcing a former Sheriff principal would chair the independent commission into the disorder. The commission reported on 5 August and concluded the pitch invasion was sparked by the high excitement of Hibernian fans, yet neither club could be blamed. The report highlighted security plans were appropriate and that the Scottish Government should consider criminalising pitch invasions. However, Rangers raised concerns about several factual inaccuracies and contradictions in the report and asked to discuss this with the SFA. On 30 August 2016, Rangers and Hibernian were issued with notices of complaint by the Scottish FA's compliance officer in relation to the Scottish Cup final. The end of May, post the 2016 Scottish Cup Final, saw Rangers continue preparations for the forthcoming season with the signing of English Championship winner Joey Barton from Burnley, Liverpool youth player Jordan Rossiter and former Tottenham Hotspur play-maker Niko Kranjčar. Rangers managing director Stewart Robertson also disclosed Warburton and Weir were negotiating new contracts, with the pair agreeing one-year extensions on 12 July. Warburton would go on to bring in eleven new players in total, including paying a million-pound-plus transfer fee for Englishman Joe Garner which represented the largest investment made by Rangers in a player for over five years since the signing of current club captain Lee Wallace in July 2011. In June 2016, it was announced by the SPFL that the Challenge Cup would be expanded to include teams from the Welsh Premier League, Northern Irish Premiership and an under-20s side from each Scottish Premiership club. On the same day as this announcement, the under-20s team coach Ian Durrant was relieved of his duties in a coaching reshuffle, with Rangers appointing Graeme Murty as Head Development Squad Coach on 17 August, to replace him. The draw for the first round of the 2016–17 Challenge Cup was made with Rangers under-20s side paired with Stirling University F.C. who play in the Lowland Football League. The U20 side progressed conformably beating Stirling University 4–0 at Forthbank Stadium with Josh Jeffries scoring a brace. A second round tie with Scottish League One side Stenhousemuir was set-up, again played at Forthbank, however, the side could not match its previous performance and went down 3–1 with Ryan Hardie netting the Rangers goal. The senior side began the season in mid-July as part of the new look League Cup format, paired in a group with Motherwell, Annan Athletic, East Stirlingshire and Stranraer. The season got off to a winning start as the side beat Motherwell and Annan Athletic by 2–0 respectively. After topping their group and strong showings in the two subsequent rounds, Rangers set up a semi-final against Celtic, however, the side lost 1-0 which ended their participation in the competition. The side league form proved equally fruitless as the side engaged in a faulting start to the season which culminated in a humiliating 5–1 defeat to Old Firm rivals, Celtic. The opening league match of the season saw Rangers stutter to a 1–1 draw at home to Hamilton Academical and despite registering wins in the following to matches Rangers would go through the month of September without winning a league match, including defeats to both Aberdeen and Celtic. The aftermath from the latter match saw Rangers suspend midfielder Joey Barton for three weeks. Barton had been involved in a training ground bust up with fellow midfielder Andy Halliday a few days after losing to Celtic. The suspension was extended by another week on 9 October and Barton was also charged by the Scottish Football Association for breaking rules relating to gambling on football matches. Upon the completion of his suspension, Barton returned to Ibrox for a meeting on 27 October, however, upon its conclusion it emerged that he remained suspended by the club and no party made further comment. In the meanwhile, despite the first-team's indifferent league form the side still sat second in the Scottish Premiership by the end of October, even though two of the marquee summer signings had effectively been ruled out for the season, with Barton returning from suspension but being relegated to the youth-team and Niko Kranjčar suffering cruciate ligament which sidelined him for the rest of the season. Barton was unhappy at being relegated to the youth team and was signed off with stress on 8 November but the saga came to a conclusion two days later when the Englishman agreed to a mutual contract terminated. The sides form improved through December, with the team building a four match winning run on the back of a poor 2–0 defeat to Heart of Midlothian at Tynecastle on 30 November. However, the final two matches of 2016 saw the side collect only one point from a possible six with a draw away to St Johnstone and defeat in the third Old Firm derby of the season. This left the club second in the table going into 2017 and the mid-season break, two points ahead of third placed Aberdeen although the latter did have a game in hand. The January transfer window saw the club released several former youth prospects who had failed to meet expectations, while Warburton brought in two young loanee signings from English Premier League sides in the shape of Emerson Hyndman and Jon Toral from Bournemouth and Arsenal respectively. However, the lack of any permanent outfield signings drew criticism, as did the performances of the previous summers transfers, with particular focus being placed on the role of Head of Recruitment Frank McParland. On 10 February 2017, manager Warburton, assistant manager David Weir and McParland left Rangers, with the former being replaced by Graeme Murty who was placed in caretaker control of the first-team. Several reasons for the trio departure were highlighted by the media, as well as the club. The first-team's poor performance in the first half of the season a prominent cause, which crystallised after an embarrassing 4–1 defeat away to Heart of Midlothian on 1 February and an insipid 1–1 draw at home to Ross County three days later, a match which proved to be Warburtons last game in charge of Rangers. The poor signing policy was mooted, however, the club also stated that the management team were not committed to the job and reported the team had tendered their resignations five days before being replaced which Warburton later disputed. Early contenders for the role included former Rangers manager Alex McLeish and former Rangers defender Frank de Boer. On Valentine's Day 2017, Managing director Stewart Robertson announced that the club would seek to appoint a Director of Football to work alongside a new first-team manager. Graeme Murty's time in charge began with a fourth round Scottish cup win over Greenock Morton, however, league formed remained indifferent his first two league matches ende in away defeats to Dundee and Inverness CT. This left the side in third place, six points adrift of Aberdeen, at the beginning of March. A dramatic 3–2 win of St Johnstone saw Murty register his only league win in his six-game spell as manager with his last two games in charge seeing him set up to a Scottish Cup semi-final against Celtic after a 6–0 win over Hamilton Academical, the team's largest win of the season, before drawing the third league Old Firm match. On 11 March, Rangers confirmed Pedro Caixinha as the club's sixteenth manager with the Portuguese coach appointed two days later. However, the pursuit of a Director of Football was not as successful as the Boards first choice, Southampton's Ross Wilson, turning down the offer of the role. Away from football, the board instigated court proceedings against four of its former executives and investor Mike Ashley. The case against former chief executives Charles Green and Derek Llambias, former commercial director Imran Ahmad, former financial director Brian Stockbridge and Ashley was brought regarding a loss of income caused by retail deals agreed between the company that owns the club and Sports Direct from 2012 to 2015. Details of Rangers legal claim was revealed on 12 August after Ashley's lawyers succeeded in a bid to the documents disclosed. According to the papers lodged with the Court of Session, Rangers sought approximately £4.1m in damages caused by alleged negligence by Green and other club staff from which Ashley unfairly benefited. Rangers regained representation at a domestic football level as Managing director Stewart Robertson was appointed to the SFA professional game board, although Robertson had initially signalled his intent to stand for the SPFL board but withdrew due to a lack of support. Meanwhile, the former Rangers owner Craig Whyte was the only person facing fraud charges relating to the liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc, proceedings began in June. In a bizarre twist, former Rangers vice-chairman Donald Findlay QC was appointed to Whyte's legal team and defended Whyte when he faced charges relating to the acquisition of the club in May 2011 and its subsequent financial mismanagement. On 22 December, at his pre-trial Whyte entered a not guilty plea at the High Court in Glasgow. The trial concerning accusations of fraudulent acquisition of the Club began in April 2017, with former Rangers managers Walter Smith and Ally McCoist called to give evidence about the financial situation at the Oldco preceding Whyte's reign. The corporate aftermath of Whyte's reign was continued and it was revealed that oldco administrators have raised legal action against Police Scotland and the Lord Advocate while oldco creditors would received £2m less in potential payouts after the liquidation costs increased, leaving the total payout at £16.663m. Although RIFC did settle a fine imposed upon the Oldco by the Nimmo Smith commission after a tribunal held against the club in October 2015, the total cost was £286,000. At the start of February, it was reported that liquidators of the Oldco, BDO, had launched a legal action against former administrators Duff & Phelps over the business strategies adopted by the administrating team and seeking up to £28.9m in damages. The spectre of Mike Ashley continued to haunt Rangers in the early part of the season. Ashley lost a legal challenge to the SFA's fine over breaching dual ownership rules with reports he faced a £250,000 legal bill. In October, he was ordered to pay half of the SFA's legal costs and an additional fee for the costs incurred from receiving specialist legal advice. Moreover, further failed legal action meant Ashley was required to pay the legal costs of the SFA and Dave King following a failed bid to overturn the decision that King was a \\"fit and proper\\" person from April 2016. Despite standing down from the board of Rangers Retail in June 2016, the club's joint merchandising venture with Sports Direct, Ashley refused to relinquish his grip over Rangers retail operations. After reaching an impasse in its attempts to renegotiation the retail agreements with Sports Direct, a stand off ensued between the retailer and Rangers with the latter withdrew removing rights to use the club's intellectual property which would impact on the sale of Rangers new Puma football kits. Despite the club withdrawing permission to use its trademarks, which effectively halted the sale of kits, Puma released the 2016-17 kits at the beginning of August. This led to the board to consider replacing the Puma kits with an alternative. The contract with Rangers Retail reportedly earned the club only four pence from every pound spent on merchandise and was highlighted as a reason for Rangers weak financial performance. On Halloween 2016 it emerged that Ashley lodged a counter-suit against Rangers, King and director Paul Murray, with initial proceedings regarding the case being heard at the High Court of Justice in March 2017. The board released RIFC's annual accounts on 28 October which revealed annual losses had been halved to £3.3m and turnover increased to £22.2m, however, further funding was required to maintain the business as a going concern. In March 2017, a decision Takeover Appeal Board (TAB) following a complaint by former Rangers chairman David Somers ruled that Dave King had been acting in concerted with other investors during King's March 2015 boardroom takeover. This meant that King was liable to purchase all of the shares in RIFC, with the TAB setting a price of 20p per share. A few days later, RIFC revealed an operating profit of £300,000 in unaudited results for the six months to 31 December 2016, although this equated to a pre-tax loss of £278,000. Rangers fan groups Rangers Supporters' Trust, Rangers Supporters Assembly and Rangers First merged to form Club 1872 in late May, and two-weeks later it announced that the new organisation had purchased enough shares to make it the sixth largest shareholder in RIFC. Harmony did not last for long amongst the support, however, as three directors of the Rangers First resigned from the organisation over a row regarding its governance, with Rangers First now the shareholding vehicle for Club 1872. On 30 September, the results of the first elections to Club 1872's board was announced with seven members elected including Rangers current company secretary James Blair, former requisitioner Alex Wilson, as well as the leader of Sons of Struth, Craig Houston. In November, the fans group increased its holding further to become the fifth largest individual shareholder, possessing just over five million ordinary shares, however, further setbacks saw three directors resign from the board of Club 1872 after only six months in post.

WIRE was intended to be a four-month infrared survey of the entire sky at 21-27 micrometres and 9-15 micrometres, specifically focusing on starburst galaxies and luminous protogalaxies. The science team was based at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, California. Flight operations, integration, and testing were from Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. The telescope was built by Space Dynamics Laboratories in Utah. Premature ejection of the spacecraft aperture cover led to depletion of the solid hydrogen cryogen shortly after launch, ending the primary science mission. The onboard star tracker remained functional, and has been used for long-term precision photometric monitoring of bright stars in support of an asteroseismology program. WIRE reentered Earth's atmosphere on May 10, 2011 (around 07:00 UTC). Mission A design flaw in the spacecraft control electronics caused the telescope dust cover to eject prematurely in its first few hours on-orbit, exposing the telescope to the Earth. In normal operations the telescope would avoid pointing at the Earth as well as the Sun because the heat load was too high for the cryogenic cooling. At this early stage in the mission, the telescope was deliberately pointed at the Earth for safety under the assumption that the dust cover was present. The influx of power into the telescope caused the solid hydrogen cryostat to boil off all of its cryogen. As a result, the cryostat vent, now expelling gas at rates orders of magnitude higher than designed, acted as a tiny thruster rocket overwhelming the attitude control system and ultimately spinning the spacecraft up as high as 60 rpm. After the hydrogen was exhausted, spacecraft engineers were able to re-establish attitude control. However, with the cryogen gone, the science instrument was no longer functional and the original science mission ended. In order to salvage some functionality from the spacecraft, operations were redirected after the failure of the cryogen system to an alternate science mission using the undamaged onboard star tracker for long-term monitoring of bright stars in support of an asteroseismology program. This technique aims to measure oscillations in nearby stars to probe their structure. While the star tracker has poor spatial resolution, having been designed primarily for a wide field of view and detection of the brightest stars, it is above the atmosphere and thus avoids scintillation, enabling high-precision photometry. As a secondary experiment, one solar array includes a section with reflectors, to test a concentrator system. The original science goals of WIRE may finally be achieved by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission which was successfully launched into orbit on December 14, 2009, and began observations on January 14, 2010.

The FCT was bordered by the province of Sind to the northeast and the princely state of Las Bela to the northwest with the Arabian Sea to the south. History Karachi became the first capital of the new country of Pakistan in 1947. The FCT was created in 1948 to enable the federal government to operate from a nationally held territory. At that time it had a population of 400,000 people which began to increase rapidly because of the political focus on the city and the fact that it was the major commercial seaport for western Pakistan. When the territory was absorbed into the province of West Pakistan the city had a population of about 1.9 million. The main ethnic groups in this region before partition of the Indian subcontinent consisted of several small linguistic and religious groups such as Gujarati communities, which included Parsis, Hindus, Sunni Muslims, Ismaili Muslims, Daudi Bohras, Marwari Muslims, Kacchi Muslims, and a large number of local Christian communities. A considerable number of Sindhis and Balochs resided in sporadic villages in this region. However, all of these communities were collectively and simultaneously outnumbered by the inflow of Muslim Muhajir who started settling in Karachi because it was the federal capital as well as the largest commercial hub; and some what due to Hindu communities' migration from this region to India, resulting dramatic and demographic changes in this area. Geography and climate The Federal Capital Territory occupied 2,103 km² compared to the current City-District of Karachi which occupies 3,527 km². Apart from Karachi city, the Federal Capital Territory also contained several small villages and towns which have now been subsumed in the metropolitan area of Karachi. The territory covered rolling plains bound by hills to the north and west, the river Indus to the east and the Arabian Sea to the south. Several smaller rivers flowed through the heart of the territory including the river Malir and the river Layari. The Port of Karachi was located in a protected bay to the southwest of the city, protected by several small islands. The climate of the territory was moderated by the influence of the sea with relatively mild winters and warm summers. There was low precipitation and high humidity for much of the year except during the short monsoon rains. Economy and transport Karachi was and still is the financial capital of Pakistan, accounting for the largest share of the nation's GDP and generating the largest share of the national revenue. The State Bank of Pakistan and most commercial banks had their headquarters in Karachi together with Pakistan's first and largest stock exchange - the KSE now PSX. The FCT was served by the old Quaid-e-Azam International Airport (now Jinnah International Airport) terminal which is now used for Hajj flights and cargo facilities. In addition there was an airport at Mauripur which is now the Masroor Pakistan Air Force base. In 1947, Karachi had the only major port in western Pakistan while Chittagong was the main port for eastern Pakistan. The city was linked to the rest of West Pakistan by railway with the main stations at Karachi City Station and Karachi Cantonment Station.

It was written by series creator Rob Thomas, and directed by Mark Piznarski. Set in the fictional town of Neptune, the pilot introduces Kristen Bell as the title character, a high-school student moonlighting as a private investigator under the wing of her detective father. Two separate mysteries are presented in the episode, which are explored throughout the season and resolved in the final and penultimate episodes. Thomas originally wrote Veronica Mars as a young adult novel, featuring a male as the protagonist. He changed the gender of the protagonist because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be more interesting and unique. The original pilot script was darker in tone than the one filmed, and several details were changed. Although it ranked low in the ratings, the pilot was critically acclaimed and Bell's performance as the protagonist was praised. Plot Flashbacks reveal Veronica's backstory: in small-town Neptune, California, Veronica – daughter of well-respected County Sheriff Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni) is a typical teen who was dating Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn), and was popular with loving parents. But when her best friend and Duncan's sister, Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried), is murdered, Veronica's life falls apart. Keith accuses software billionaire Jake Kane (Kyle Secor), Lilly's father, of being involved in the murder. This provokes Neptune's wrath, and Keith is ousted from office and replaced by Don Lamb (Michael Muhney) in a recall election. Veronica's mother, Lianne Mars (Corinne Bohrer), unable to face the loss of status and economic security, develops a drinking problem and suddenly leaves town. Veronica's boyfriend also ends their relationship, and her friends turn their backs on her. To prove that she is unaffected by the rejection, Veronica attends wealthy classmate Shelly Pomroy's \\"09er\\" party. Her drink is spiked with GHB and she is raped, but Sheriff Lamb refuses to take her report seriously. These events shock Veronica and she changes her attitude towards her former friends, becoming tough and cynical. Estranged from all her \\"09er\\" friends—wealthy students from the fictional 90909 ZIP code—including Duncan and Lilly's ex-boyfriend, Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring), and feeling the drop in income and status that her father's dismissal from office brings, Veronica takes a part-time job in her father's newly opened private investigation agency, Mars Investigations. Although the case of Lilly's murder is officially closed following the confession of a former Kane Software employee, Abel Koontz (Christian Clemenson), Veronica continues her own investigation into what happened. Her investigation discovers new evidence which suggests that Koontz is innocent. In the present, Veronica starts her Junior year at Neptune High by freeing new student Wallace Fennel (Percy Daggs III), who had been stripped and duct-taped to the school flag pole. Wallace explains that while working at the local Sac- n-Pac, he alerted the sheriff's department to two PCH (Pacific Coast Highway) bikers who took alcohol without paying. Sheriff Lamb exposes Wallace as the witness, and despite Wallace's attempts to retract his accusation, Lamb walks away with proof from the in-store video camera. Wallace's duct-taping is PCH retribution for his honesty. In a convoluted scheme to help Wallace, Veronica sets up Logan by placing a bong in his locker. Once the bong is taken to the evidence room at the sheriff's department, Veronica triggers it to smoke and spark by remote control, leading to the arrival of the fire department. The fire chief, a friend of Veronica, switches the video from the Sac-n-Pac with one Veronica filmed of a deputy receiving sexual favors. When the bikers are in court, that video is shown instead, embarrassing Lamb and undermining the case against the bikers. Wallace is forgiven and Eli \\"Weevil\\" Navarro (Francis Capra), the bikers' leader, becomes Veronica's occasional ally. At Mars Investigations, Duncan and Lilly's mother, Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill) hires Keith to ascertain if her husband Jake is having an affair, despite her open contempt for both Keith and Veronica. Keith is busy with other projects, and Veronica takes it upon herself to follow Jake. Veronica takes photos of him at the Camelot hotel as he meets with an unseen woman after midnight. Once Keith sees the license plate number of the woman's car, he stops the investigation and files the photograph. Puzzled by his actions, Veronica finds the file and learns that Keith has continued his own personal investigation of Lilly's murder. Veronica discovers that the car belongs to her missing mother, Lianne, and begins to investigate the murder herself. Production =Conception= Rob Thomas originally wrote Veronica Mars as a young adult novel for publishing company Simon & Schuster. Prior to his first television job on Dawson's Creek, Thomas sold two novel ideas. One of these was provisionally titled Untitled Rob Thomas Teen Detective Novel, which formed the basis for the series. The novel had many elements similar to Veronica Mars, however the protagonist was male. Thomas's father was a vice-principal at Westlake High School in Austin, Texas, and the main character attended a \\"thinly disguised version\\" of the school. As Thomas had begun writing for film and television, he did not resume his teen detective idea for several years. Writing a novel could take months for Thomas, whereas a television script only took several weeks. Knowing that television scripts paid more, Thomas wrote the television version of the teen detective project as a spec script before it became a novel. Since no studio or network had asked him to write it, and he would not get paid unless it sold, Thomas said that \\"it was never a very pressing project for me\\". Tinkering with it from time to time, Thomas wrote project notes a year before he actually started writing the television script. Most of his original ideas made it into the script, but some changed drastically. Thomas wanted to use flashbacks, and he had to shorten the timeline so that the murder could happen in a recent time. Thomas changed the gender of the protagonist because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be more interesting and unique. =Casting= Teddy Dunn, who portrayed Duncan Kane, originally auditioned for the role of Logan Echolls. Kristen Bell was chosen to portray Veronica Mars from more than 500 women who auditioned for the role. On casting the lead role, Thomas later commented, \\"When you're casting 20-year-old hot girl, you see a lot of bad actors.\\" Bell felt that it was \\"just luck\\" that Rob Thomas saw that \\"I have some sass to me, and that's exactly what he wanted\\". Bell thought that it was her cheerleader looks and an outsider's attitude that set her apart from the other women who auditioned. Bell's life shared many similarities with that of her character—her father had \\"an investigative bent\\", and her best friend died in high school in a car crash. Jason Dohring, who played Logan Echolls, originally auditioned for the role of Duncan Kane. Teddy Dunn originally auditioned for Logan, but ended up portraying Duncan Kane. Dohring felt that his audition for Duncan \\"was a little dark\\", and he was told by the producers that it was \\"not really right\\". The producers asked Dohring to read for the role of Logan, which involved reading Duncan's lines. Dohring acted one scene from the pilot, in which he shattered the headlights of a car with a crowbar. During the final auditions, Dohring read two times with Bell and met with the studio and the network. When reading with Bell, Dohring acted the whole scene as if he had raped her, and tried to give the character an evil and fun feel. At the time of Dohring's audition for Logan, the character was only going to be a guest star in the pilot. Percy Daggs III auditioned for the role of Wallace Fennel twice before being cast, and he had to go through three tests with the studio and network executives. During his first audition, Daggs read four scenes from the pilot. Before his studio test, Daggs read with Bell and had \\"a great conversation\\". He said that she \\"made me feel comfortable about auditioning\\" and was a big reason why he became more comfortable playing Wallace as the season went on. Thomas described Amanda Seyfried, who portrayed the murdered Lilly Kane, as \\"the biggest surprise of the year\\". When casting a series regular, he was able to see all the best actors in town, mainly because they all wanted to be a series regular. When casting Lilly, who would only appear from time-to-time as \\"the dead girl\\", Thomas did not receive the same level of actors. Thomas said that he had \\"never had a more cut and dried audition\\" than he did with Seyfried; she was \\"about 100 times better than anyone else that we saw, she was just spectacular\\". He said that she ended up being so good in the series that he used her three or four times more than he initially planned. =Filming= The original pilot script was darker in tone than the one filmed. Thomas intended to take the script to FX, HBO or Showtime, but gave UPN \\"credit\\" as they only wanted it a bit lighter to match their standards and practices. There was also a lengthy debate as to whether Veronica could be a rape victim; UPN eventually consented. In the aired version of the episode, Lilly Kane was found by the pool in the same spot where she was murdered. However, Thomas stated that Lilly's body was originally going to be found in the ocean, and he had a plan for events which led to Lilly's body being dumped. When Thomas pitched the idea to UPN, the network felt that it was \\"too dark and creepy\\" for Jake Kane to dispose of his daughter's body to protect his son, and the idea was changed. Much of the series' scenes were filmed at Stu Segall Productions in San Diego. During the filming of the pilot, producer Paul Kurta said that much of the filming would take place in Oceanside, California. Kurta liked that it was \\"a seaside town that still feels like middle-class people live there ... Most of the seaside towns feel resort driven.\\" The setting of Neptune High, which was featured in the first two seasons, was also located in Oceanside. The school, Oceanside High School, was paid $7,750 by Stu Segall Productions for the use of the campus and extras. When Thomas watched the final cut of the scene in which Veronica realizes that she has been raped, Thomas thought that he had cast the role correctly. \\"I’m watching her from the monitor, and tears start streaming down her face, and I’m just like, 'Holy shit! We have a star!'\\" Music \\"We Used to Be Friends\\" by The Dandy Warhols was used as the series' theme song. Composer Josh Kramon was originally going to produce a noir version of an '80s song for the theme. However, Rob Thomas was \\"pretty much set on finding a song\\", and \\"We Used to Be Friends\\" was chosen right from the beginning. Kramon wrote the original background music to convey the film noir themes. For the pilot, Thomas wanted \\"a really atmospheric, kind of modern noir type of vibe\\", and Kramon used sounds similar to that of Air and Zero 7. Kramon used \\"traditional sounds\\" for the series, but also processed and filtered them. Among the instruments used were piano, vibraphone and guitar. When using an acoustic piano, Kramon would use compression so that it did not sound like a traditional piano. Live bass and percussion was also used, as Kramon did not like to program them. The main instrument used was guitar, but Kramon felt that piano was \\"by far the most important instrument for working on TV shows, especially when you're doing everything yourself.\\" A week before choosing the sounds for the pilot, the crew had a \\"spotting session\\", where they would discuss with Thomas and the producers which type of music was going to be featured. Kramon did not decide the songs to be featured, but composed and created the whole score. Since there was little orchestral music, and Kramon could play guitar, piano, bass and drums, he played the whole score without hiring a musician. =Other songs heard in this episode= * \\"La Femme d'Argent\\" by Air * \\"What You Want\\" by The Wayouts * \\"Insincere Because I\\" by The Dandy Warhols * \\"Sittin' On Top Of The World\\" by Botany Boyz * \\"Just Another\\" by Pete Yorn * \\"White Lines (Don't Do It)\\" by Grandmaster Flash * \\"Give You More\\" by Taxi Doll * \\"Girls\\" by Death In Vegas * \\"Bathroom Stall\\" by DAMe Lee * \\"Weak Become Heroes\\" by The Streets * \\"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\\" by Blue Öyster Cult * \\"Pata Pata\\" by Miriam Makeba * \\"Cemetery Party\\" by Air * \\"Atomic Girl\\" by The Wannabes * \\"Butterflies\\" by Davíd Garza Reception Kristen Bell's performance was praised by many critics. The pilot was viewed by an average of 2.49 million American viewers on its original broadcast, ranking 108 out of 112 in the weekly charts. Debra Leithauser and Amy Amatangelo of The Washington Post praised the pilot for relying \\"on strong storytelling and casting\\", but hoped that viewers would be able to follow the multiple storylines. Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter said that the pilot was \\"so cleverly constructed, the hero so engaging and complicated and the story so filled with great dialogue that I wonder how anyone can sustain this level of accomplishment.\\" He said that the protagonist \\"has all the sass, strength, resolve and ingenuity of any of literature's classic detectives [...] and Bell is so convincing in the role that it all somehow makes perfect sense.\\" He praised the pilot and Thomas' writing, saying it had \\"comedy, deathly serious drama, parody and danger, ingredients not typically mixed together\\", and said that \\"if future episodes are half as good, this still will be one of TV's bright spots\\". Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially \\"this season's most interesting character creation\\". McFadden described the series as \\"Alias in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class-consciousness\\". Phil Gallo of Variety called Veronica Mars \\"the smartest teen-oriented drama since Freaks and Geeks\\". He enjoyed Bell's acting, describing her \\"as charismatic as she is tough and intelligent, giving a multilayered perf that touches on simple 17-year-old insecurity and convincingly incorporates deeper issues concerning family, love and disappointment.\\" Gallo discussed the pilot's reliance on flashbacks and voiceover, and felt that neither got in the way of the storytelling or felt too obvious. He praised Thomas' writing of the \\"fine script\\" and Piznarski's directing. Robert Bianco of USA Today felt that Veronica Mars was more akin to Buffy Summers than Nancy Drew, with \\"sharp wits, steely nerves and a wicked sense of humor\\". Bianco praised Bell's portrayal of the character, saying \\"whether you buy the idea of teen crime- solvers or not, there's no questioning Bell's credentials as a TV star.\\" Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that the pilot was \\"showing signs of being network television's next Buffy\\", emanating from a tough, emotionally battered heroine. McFarland found the acting to be fantastic, and said that Bell and Colantoni \\"create a wonderful father- daughter dynamic\\". Samantha Bonar of the Los Angeles Times thought that the writing was clever, and praised Bell ability to channel charisma, smarts and frustration. IGN rated the pilot episode 10th on its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, writing that \\"The smooth introduction to all things Veronica makes you care for her instantly. Anyone wrestling with creating a female character who is multifaceted and real needs only to study Veronica. We see many different sides, and there isn't any stereotyping. They sell her tough exterior so well that even though Veronica has been through a pile of crap, you don't pity her – which is good, because she doesn't want it anyway.\\" References External links Category:2004 American television episodes Veronica Mars Category:Veronica Mars (season 1) episodes fr:Mars investigation ","title":"Pilot (Veronica Mars)"},{"id":"3913110","text":"The Old Vicksburg Bridge, also known as Mississippi River Bridge, is a cantilever bridge carrying one rail line across the Mississippi River between Delta, Louisiana and Vicksburg, Mississippi. History Old Vicksburg Bridge Until 1998, the bridge was open to motor vehicles and carried U.S. Route 80 (US 80) across the Mississippi River. It is now only a railroad bridge, though one road lane runs through the bridge for inspection by workers. It was replaced by the new Vicksburg Bridge, a short distance down river, for vehicle crossings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. It was built by the Vicksburg Bridge & Terminal Co. during 1928-1930 and has three cantilevered truss spans and three Parker truss spans. (which notes as its source the Jackson \\"Clarion Ledger\\" of May 21, 1980) With . During the period when the bridge was open to regular traffic a rather unusual system was used to handle the tractor-trailer truck traffic which used the bridge. Located at each end of the bridge, there were a pair of railroad styled signal towers, which required trucks to stop. At one time trucks were allowed to traverse the bridge along with other vehicle and train traffic. In order to do this the truck driver would pull the passenger side mirror in and then position his front passenger side tire against a rail located just off the roadway surface. Using this method trucks could meet and pass each other while traveling east or west. The most unnerving was going east and meeting a train moving westward on the trucks passenger side and another truck west bound on the drivers side. The signal towers prevented this from occurring anymore. Once stopped, the towers would close off traffic for all vehicles in both directions, and then allow trucks to cross the bridge alone, using the full width of both of the narrow lanes, as opposed to staying in just one lane. Due to numerous safety concerns, crossings by trucks were limited to day time only operation, with trucks being required to wait until dawn before being allowed on the bridge.

This includes the use of differential GPS and SAR remote sensing to monitor the risks imposed by landslides and subsidence. For large dams seismographs are used to detect reservoir-induced seismicity that could threaten the stability of the dam. The output of these systems can provide warning to the local population ahead of a potential collapse. Particular applications =Ukraine= The monitoring and warning system safeguarding the Kiev Reservoir dam is complicated enough to include protection from a space object impact. =Italy= The dam monitoring system of Enel green Power Enel Green Power 'Enel Green Power locations' in Riolunato Dam, controls all important parameters of the dam. Optical and physical alignment systems are installed for control any movement of the land under and around the dam. The dam monitoring system checks the level of the water because this creates different pressures on the dam also in relation at temperature of the water and the temperature of the air. All these parameters are controlled and compared with the deformation and stress applied on the structure of the dam, measured with extensimeter, pendulum, reverse pendulum, piezometer, etc. The dam monitoring system continuously store and analyze all the dam parameters, creating 5 typologies if alarms. For each level of alarm the dam monitoring system set different levels of risk that involve specific reaction, like reduction of the level of the water in the lake and communication at the network of all dam control system. When the level of risk increase, the monitoring system activate alarms for close some road or bridge, and eventually alerted people living in some village. All data are continuously sent from the dam monitoring system at the network dam control system were specialist engineers take decision about eventually emergency situations. The Riolunato dam monitoring local system software is developed from AuCo Solutions.AuCo Solutions 'Dams monitoring' In the 80s and 90s, Enel fostered also the development of a family of expert systems for dam safety management, based on the application of artificial intelligence techniques to the real-time interpretation of monitoring data gathered by automatic acquisition systems. From the project DAMSAFE, several instances of a decision support system named MISTRAL were derived, which were installed on the Pieve di Cadore Dam owned by Enel (1996), but also on other dams managed by other companies, such as Ridracoli Dam (1992), Cancano (1997), Fusino (1998), Valgrosina (1998), and San Giacomo (2001). Some of these systems are still operating after more than twenty years. =United States= Dam safety systems became a focus of multi-agency regulations during the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers construction of large flood control and hydro-electric power generation projects. To help benchmark proven practices, the Association of State Dam Safety Officials (ASDSO) formed a national non-profit organization of state and federal dam safety regulators, dam owners and operators, engineering consultants, manufacturers and suppliers, academia, contractors and others interested in dams safety. More recently public safety concerns were addressed by the Indian Dams Safety Act of 1992 during hearings before the Select Committee on Indian Affairs, United States Senate, 102nd Congress, second session, on S. 2617. The purpose was to provide for the maintenance of dams located on Indian lands in New Mexico by the Bureau of Indian Affairs through contracts with the Indian tribes. (August 4, 1992 in Washington, D.C.) The ASDSO Conference Proceedings paper by Gary R. Holtzhausen (1991) describes the effective use of tiltmeters with remote sensing to provide reliable low-cost early warning of impending structural failures. The ASDSO Conference Proceedings paper by Barry K.

Many proteins contain only amino acids and no other chemical groups, and they are called simple proteins. However, other kind of proteins yield, on hydrolysis, some other chemical component in addition to amino acids and they are called conjugated proteins. The non-amino part of a conjugated protein is usually called its prosthetic group. Most prosthetic groups are formed from vitamins. Conjugated proteins are classified on the basis of the chemical nature of their prosthetic groups. Examples Some examples of conjugated proteins are lipoproteins, glycoproteins, phosphoproteins, hemoproteins, flavoproteins, metalloproteins, phytochromes, cytochromes, opsins and chromoproteins. Hemoglobin contains the prosthetic group known as heme. Each heme group contains an iron ion (Fe2+) which forms a co-ordinate bond with an oxygen molecule (O2), allowing hemoglobin to transport oxygen through the bloodstream. As each of the four protein subunits of hemoglobin possesses its own prosthetic heme group, each hemoglobin can transport four molecules of oxygen. Glycoproteins are generally the largest and most abundant group of conjugated proteins. They range from glycoproteins in cell surface membranes that constitute the glycocalyx, to important antibodies produced by leukocytes.

He was educated by his maternal grandfather at Phillips Academy in Massachusetts, where he was a classmate of future U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush. After serving in the U.S. Navy and attending Yale, the Sorbonne, and Harvard Business School, Kiam worked for Lever Brothers and Playtex as a salesman. He bought the Benrus Watch Company in 1968, selling his majority stake in 1977. He made a fortune as the President and CEO of Remington Products, which he famously purchased in 1979 after his wife bought him his first electric shaver. His purchase of Remington is considered an early example of a leveraged buyout. Remington, which had lost $30 million in the previous three years, made a profit in his first year as owner. Kiam became famous as the spokesman for the Remington shaver. His catchphrase, \\"I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company\\", made him a household name. He recorded each commercial in the native language of the country in which it was broadcast. In the United Kingdom he became a celebrity, appearing on such television shows as Wogan, The Tube, and Through the Keyhole. He also owned other companies, including PIC Industrial Design and TravelSmart. In 1988, Kiam bought the NFL's New England Patriots from founder Billy Sullivan.Billy Sullivan, 86 [sic], Founder Of Football Patriots, Dies The New York Times. Accessed October 20, 2007. The sale did not include Foxboro Stadium, which Sullivan lost in a bankruptcy sale to paper magnate Robert Kraft, and Kiam lost money on the deal. In 1990, Lisa Olson, a Boston Herald reporter, sued Kiam and the Patriots when Zeke Mowatt allegedly exposed himself and made lewd comments to her in the team change room. The incident stirred debate over female reporters in the locker room. Kiam became the center of the controversy when he came to the defense of the players' actions. The episode helped inspire the 2013 ESPN documentary, Let Them Wear Towels. In his later career, Kiam’s business interests moved on from the Patriots, which he sold in 1992 to St. Louis businessman James Orthwein, and Remington, which he sold 50% of to Isaac Perlmutter that same year. Kiam is also well known for \\"Lady Remington\\" jewelry, a direct sales jewelry company specializing in in- home parties. Later, it was renamed Lia Sophia, after his granddaughters, Lia and Sophia. The company was at one point the largest direct selling jewelry in the world and was listed among the top 20 largest direct sales companies by the Direct Selling Association. The direct sales division of the company was closed down in December 2014, when its 25,000 sales advisors in the United States and Canada were laid off.Lia Sophia Closing at chicagotribune.com, December 2014 Personal life and death In 1956, Kiam married Ellen Lipscher, former wife of film producer Richard E. Lyons. He resided in Stamford, Connecticut at the time of his death. He was survived by his wife, Ellen, and three children, Lisa Lyons Durkin, Victor \\"Tory\\" Kiam III, and Robin Kiam Aviv (married to Jonathan E. Aviv), and seven grandchildren, Jenny, Alexander, Sophia, Lia, Caleigh, Nikki, and Blake. Upon Kiam's death The Times quoted one of his closest business associates in later years, Jonathon Lyons, as saying that he was \\"a truly remarkable entrepreneur of the old kind – the kind they simply don't make any more\\".

Some enzymes do not need additional components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity. Cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron- sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). Organic cofactors can be either coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase). An example of an enzyme that contains a cofactor is carbonic anhydrase, which has a zinc cofactor bound as part of its active site. These tightly bound ions or molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in catalysis. For example, flavin and heme cofactors are often involved in redox reactions. Enzymes that require a cofactor but do not have one bound are called apoenzymes or apoproteins. An enzyme together with the cofactor(s) required for activity is called a holoenzyme (or haloenzyme). The term holoenzyme can also be applied to enzymes that contain multiple protein subunits, such as the DNA polymerases; here the holoenzyme is the complete complex containing all the subunits needed for activity.

The school is an academy. History Park House, Ossett Grammar School in 1907, the building is still part of the school today Founded in 1735, the school originally was sited in the centre of Ossett, but the old building was demolished in 1908 to make way for a new Town Hall. The 1902 Education Act and the subsequent establishment of the West Riding County Council as the local education authority paved the way for the trustees to transfer the trust property, money and endowments to the Education Committee of Ossett Town Council. In 1907 the new co-educational Ossett Grammar School opened at its new location at Park House, off Storrs Hill Road. In 1969 the school converted to a comprehensive school and became known simply as Ossett School. In 2006 Ossett School gained dual Specialist School status as a Specialist Technology and Sports College. The school converted to an Academy School in 2011 and was renamed Ossett Academy and Sixth Form College. The school is part of the Accord Multi Academy Trust. Ossett Academy and Sixth Form College is a much larger than average secondary school with a large sixth form. The proportion of students supported through the pupil premium is below the national average. A well-below average proportion of students are from minority ethnic groups and the proportion of disabled students and those who have special educational needs supported at school action is above average.

He also served as the 18th Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly and served two terms in the Wisconsin State Senate, representing La Crosse County. Early life and career Cameron was born in Caledonia, New York on July 4, 1826, the fifth child of seven born to Scottish American immigrants Duncan and Sarah McColl Cameron. He attended Temple Hill Academy in Geneseo, New York, and then the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary in Lima, New York, which is now Syracuse University. He later studied law with the firm of Wadsworth and Cameron in Buffalo, New York. He graduated from the State and National Law School in 1853, was admitted to the bar, and practiced with Wadsworth and Cameron. He later formed a partnership with Frederick H. Wing, which was active in banking as Cameron & Wing. Political career In 1857 Cameron moved to La Crosse, Wisconsin, where he continued his legal and banking careers. Initially a Whig, he joined the Republican Party when it was founded in the mid-1850s. He served in the Wisconsin State Senate from 1863 to 1864 and 1871 to 1872. He was a delegate to the 1864 National Union National Convention. From 1866 to 1867 he served in the Wisconsin State Assembly, and he was Speaker of the Assembly in the 1867 session. Cameron also served on the University of Wisconsin–Madison Board of Regents from 1866 to 1875, and helped found Christ Church of La Crosse. In February 1875 the Wisconsin State Legislature, in joint session, elected Cameron to the United States Senate, and he served from March 4, 1875 to March 3, 1881. He did not seek reelection in 1881. During this term he was appointed chairman of a committee to investigate alleged election fraud in South Carolina during the disputed United States presidential election of 1876. In February 1881 Senator Matthew H. Carpenter died in office, and on March 10 Cameron was elected to complete the remaining four years of his six- year term. Cameron took his seat on March 14, and served until March 3, 1885. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1885. Death and legacy After leaving the Senate Cameron returned to his banking and legal interests. He died in La Crosse on March 30, 1897, and was buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in La Crosse. Cameron Park in downtown La Crosse was named for him. The village of Cameron, in Barron County, was also named for him.

He is one of 19 Apostles of Baháʼu'lláh, and referred to by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá as a Hand of the Cause of God. In the abjad notation, the name \\"Muhammad\\" has the same numerical value as \\"Nabíl\\". Nabíl-i-Akbar was the recipient of a tablet from Baháʼu'lláh, the Tablet of Wisdom. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá recounted: :\\"There was, in the city of Najaf, among the disciples of the widely known mujtahid, Shaykh Murtada, a man without likeness or peer. His name was Aqa Muhammad-i-Qa'ini, and later on he would receive, from the Manifestation, the title of Nabil-i-Akbar. This eminent soul became the leading member of the mujtahid's company of disciples. Singled out from among them all, he alone was given the rank of mujtahid -- for the late Shaykh Murtada was never wont to confer this degree. :\\"He excelled not only theology but in other branches of knowledge, such as the humanities, the philosophy of the Illumination, the teachings of the mystics and of the Shaykhi School. He was a universal man, in himself alone a convincing proof. When his eyes were opened to the light of Divine guidance, and he breathed in the fragrances of Heaven, he became a flame of God. Then his heart leapt within him, and in an ecstasy of joy and love, he roared out like leviathan in the deep.\\" ::(Memorials of the Faithful, p. 1.) Nabíl completed his studentship under Shaykh Murtaday-i-Ansari, and after he had obtained his sanction and blessing, Nabíl moved from Najaf to Baghdad. This teacher was the same Shaykh who refused to associate himself with the Shiʻi divines gathered together to concert plans against Baháʼu'lláh during his time in Baghdad. It has been claimed that \\"no one within the enclave of the Baháʼí Faith has ever surpassed the profundity of his erudition\\". As far as the accomplishment demanded of a Shiʻih mujtahid is concerned, his attainment was superb, but naturally he had little knowledge of the lore and the scholarship of the West. Mírzá Abu'l-Faḍl of Gulpáygán, on the other hand, was well versed in Islamic studies and had a wide and comprehensive knowledge of Western thought as well.

The event was observed both as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and by the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics group (MOA), hence the double designation. The source star in the gravitational lens is a main sequence star of spectral type G located around 8.8 kiloparsecs (29,000 light years) away in the galactic bulge. The lens star is an orange dwarf star of spectral type K, which is accompanied by a giant planet. Lens system OGLE-2003-BLG-235L/MOA-2003-BLG-53L is the designation given to the star in the lens system. In 2004, analysis of the light curve produced as it passed in front of the source star allowed detection of an exoplanet orbiting the star with a mass 0.0039 times that of the host star (this would put it in the jovian mass range). The star was originally assumed to be a red dwarf star, since they are the most common type of star in the galaxy. By 2006, the source and lens star had moved far enough apart (as viewed from Earth) that their light could be separated. Observations by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed that in fact the lens star was actually brighter and less red than expected, matching the expected spectra for a K dwarf of about 0.63 solar masses, more massive than the average star in the galaxy. This enables an estimate of the distance to the lens star, which puts it at around 5.8 kiloparsecs (19,000 light years) away. =Planetary system= The OGLE-2003-BLG-235L/MOA-2003-BLG-53L system consists of one planet as determined by the discovery team and the follow-up confirmation observations.

Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands Dependencies The coat of arms of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands was granted in 1985, upon the creation of the territory. Prior to 1985, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands were a dependency of the Falkland Islands, and used their coat of arms. However, prior to 1962, the islands were grouped with what is now the British Antarctic Territory and their coat of arms was used instead of the Falkland Islands’ arms. The arms consist of a shield containing a golden lion rampant holding a torch, representing the United Kingdom and discovery, together with two golden estoiles from the arms of James Cook who discovered the islands. The background of the shield is blue and white lozenges. The supporters are an Antarctic fur seal standing on a mountain, and a macaroni penguin standing on ice, both animals native to the islands. The crest is a reindeer, from the two herds of reindeer found on South Georgia Island. The motto is Leo Terram Propriam Protegat (Latin: “[Let the] Lion protect his own land”). The coat of arms is used in the fly of the flag of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and as a crest in the defaced Union Flag of the Civil Commissioner.

He was the founder of the Glyndebourne Opera House and the Glyndebourne Festival Opera at his home at Glyndebourne, near Lewes in Sussex in 1934. Born to a wealthy landed family in Eggesford, Devon, Christie was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, later spending seven years at Eton as a master. His grandfather was William Langham Christie. He served in the trenches in the First World War with the King's Royal Rifle Corps, despite partial blindness, was awarded the Military Cross, and reached the rank of Captain. Having been given the Glyndebourne Estate for his own use he began to develop local enterprises there from 1920 onwards: in 1923, he acquired the famous organbuilding company of William Hill & Son & Norman & Beard Ltd., which had come into being around 1916 with the progressive merging of its two constituent firms. The firm remained in Christie ownership until its demise in the 1990s. In 1931 he married the Canadian soprano Audrey Mildmay, and together they planned to build an opera theatre as an annex to the main house. This was completed in 1934 and the first season, which featured Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro and Cosi fan tutte, conducted by Fritz Busch, was an immediate success. In succeeding years Christie continued to finance the Glyndebourne Festival Opera himself but after World War II, during which the opera season was suspended, the costs became harder to bear. Eventually however he succeeded in getting commercial sponsorship, placing the Festival on a sound footing and enabling him to aspire to the highest artistic standards. In 1954 John Christie was made a Companion of Honour for his achievement at Glyndebourne. He died at Glyndebourne in 1962. After Christie's death, the festival was taken over by his son, Sir George Christie, and subsequently by his grandson Gus Christie. Like his father, Sir George was also made a Companion of Honour for his work at Glyndebourne. John's founding of Glyndebourne is the subject of the 2015 biographical play The Moderate Soprano by David Hare.

When it opened in 2010, it was the fourth-longest cable- stayed bridge in North America. The Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge, the first bridge to connect the two towns, had become functionally obsolete. Its narrow road had only two lanes with no shoulders. Because of its location near a sharp bend in the Mississippi River, the bridge had become a hazard to river traffic; barges and towboats frequently collided with it. In 1994, a study concluded that a new bridge was needed and the old one should be torn down. Construction was begun in 2001 and the new bridge opened in 2010. In 2011, the process of removing the old bridge began. Description Opened in 2010, the Greenville Bridge carries US 82/278 over the Mississippi River between Refuge, Mississippi and Shives, Arkansas. It is located down river from the original bridge, built in 1940. Designed by HNTB, it is a four-lane cable-stayed bridge with more than of bridge deck straddled by two concrete towers feet high and anchored by concrete piers planted below the riverbed. It has four fans of strand steel cable connected to the top of the towers which support the deck. Each of the bridge's four lanes is wide. The outside shoulders are wide and the inside shoulder width is . The bridge has a main span of . At the time of its opening, it was the fourth-longest cable-stayed bridge in North America. Both the old and new bridges are geographically mostly in Arkansas, as the state lines were determined prior to the shift west of the Mississippi River. History The first Greenville Bridge was built by the company now known as HNTB and opened to much fanfare in 1940 as the \\"pathway to progress\\" for the Mississippi Delta. It was a through-truss design and had a span of . Until 1943, this was the longest bridge for vehicles on the Mississippi River. Over time, the bridge supported increasing volumes of highway traffic and vehicles hitting the bridge. In the 1950s, an Air Force plane crashed into the bridge. Though the bridge remained structurally sound, it was becoming functionally obsolete. It had only two narrow highway lanes and no shoulders. An accident or the crossing of very large vehicles such as a large combine could force the bridge to close. 3-D artistic prototype of the new bridge with the old bridge and the sharp bend in the Mississippi River in the background With river traffic increasing, damage from barge collisions increased. By 1972, the Greenville Bridge was hit more times by barges than any other bridge on the Mississippi. The bridge was located close to a sharp bend in the Mississippi; towboats and barges had difficulty making the sharp turn and regaining their course in time to avoid a collision with the bridge. Over the years, many have not been able to make the turn quickly and have hit it. The bridge had become a danger to river traffic. A 1994 engineering study by the Mississippi Department of Transportation explored alternatives to upgrading the crossing of US 82 and issued a report that explored a four-lane crossing at Greenville. It concluded the best of several alternatives it identified was to build a new bridge downriver from the old one and to remove the old bridge. Additional studies evaluated the type of bridge to build, and by 1995 the cable-stayed bridge was chosen as the best design to fit the river and soil conditions, as well as providing sufficient clearance for river navigation. Engineering plans were completed in 1999. Construction HNTB, of Kansas City, Missouri, was the designer and consulting engineer for both the new bridge as well as the original Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge. The federal government provided $110 million to begin building the main part of the bridge consisting long spans supported by cables. The main superstructure construction began in December 2001. Massman Construction Company in a joint venture with Traylor Brothers, Inc. received the contract to construct two large piers in the river; these were built using both floating caissons and open caisson construction. The construction on the last main span section of the bridge was finished in April 2006. Wire cable fans on cable-stayed Greenville Bridge Building the approaches, including shorter spans of approach bridge work and structural support systems for the bridge, was the responsibility of each state. For both states, the approach bridges are constructed of a series of three span units, each unit long. Construction of Arkansas' approach of highway and bridge, costing $66 million, began in March 2006; Mississippi began its approach in April, 2006, costing almost $86 million. Hill Brothers Construction and Jensen Construction, in a joint venture with the Rasmussen Group, were awarded the contract for the eastern approach of US 82 in Greenville to the Mississippi River crossing. Hills Brothers Construction was awarded an $85.9 million contract to work on the road deck of the Mississippi approach to the bridge, the concrete footings, and the substructure and superstructure of that portion. Austin Bridge and Road was awarded a $65 million contract to build Arkansas's of approach bridge and of connecting roadway which was completed in August 2009. The remaining contract, to apply a latex surface to the bridge, add stripes, tie US 82 into the approaches and dismantle the Humphreys Bridge, was awarded in January 2010. View of the Greenville Bridge from the Mississippi River. It took sixteen years from the initial developing stage begun in 1994, until the Greenville Bridge opened to traffic on August 4, 2010. The entire cost of the bridge totaled $336 million. In 2011, the massive process of removing the old bridge by cutting into small sections to be recycled was begun and was expected to be completed by September 2012. At times, the river has been closed to traffic to aid the demolition. The job was dangerous and at least two workers died during the demolition.

Gresham's School is one of the top 30 International Baccalaureate schools in England.The Top International Baccalaureate Schools by average points per pupil best-schools.co.uk The school was founded in 1555 by Sir John Gresham as a free grammar school for forty boys, following King Henry VIII's dissolution of the Augustinian priory at Beeston Regis. The founder left the school's endowments in the hands of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers of the City of London, who are still the school's trustees. In the 1890s, an increase in the rental income of property in the City of London led to a major expansion of the school, which built many new buildings on land it owned on the eastern edge of Holt, including several new boarding houses as well as new teaching buildings, library and chapel. Gresham's began to admit girls in the early 1970s and is now fully co-educational. As well as its senior school, it operates a preparatory and a Nursery and Pre-Prep school, the latter now in the Old School House, the original senior school. Altogether, the three schools teach about eight hundred children. History Gresham's School, sketched in 1838 =The school= Gresham's School at Holt was founded by Sir John Gresham by letters patent of 1555, during the reign of Queen Mary I. For its home he gave the school his house at Holt, which he had bought in 1546 from his elder brother Sir William Gresham. The founding of Gresham's was connected to King Henry VIII's suppression of the Priory of Augustinian canons at Beeston Regis in June 1539. The priory, established in 1216, had operated a school which John Gresham and his brothers probably attended, but the school came to an end with the priory, leaving no provision for education in the vicinity of Holt. The new school opened and was granted a Royal Charter in 1562. By the letters patent of 1555, the school was called in full 'The Free Grammar School of Sir John Gresham, knight, citizen and alderman of London'. The founder endowed Gresham's generously, placing its property in trust with the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers of London, and full estate records dating from the school's foundation are held at the Guildhall Library. Sir John Gresham's endowments included his freehold property in Holt and Letheringsett, his wood and land called Prior's Grove, his manors of Pereers and Holt Hales, \\"with all and singular to the same belonging, situate in Holt, Sherington, Letheringsett, Bodham, Kellinge, Wayborne, Semlingham, Stodrye, Bantrye and West Wickham, in the said county of Norfolk\\", and also tenements called 'The White Hind' and 'The Peacock' in the parish of St Giles's Without, Cripplegate, in the City of London. Close links with the Fishmongers' Company continue to this day.The Worshipful Company of Fishmongers official site . Retrieved 15 August 2007. By his Will of 1601, Leonard Smith, a fishmonger of London, left £120 and all his goods to establish a fellowship at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge and in 1604 'Mr Smith's Fellowship' was confirmed by the college, with the provision that \\"scholars from the Grammar School of Holt, in Norfolk\\" were to have preference.Potts, Robert, Liber Cantabrigiensis (1855) p. 373 The school library contains the Foundation Library, a collection of books and manuscripts provided at the school's establishment in 1555 and later.A Catalogue of the Foundation Library of Gresham's School, by P.J. Lee (Holt, 1965) On Christmas Day 1650, the Reverend Thomas Cooper, MA, a former usher of Gresham's, was hanged for his part in a Royalist rebellion on behalf of Charles II. His body was left hanging on a gibbet in Holt's Market Place. For three hundred and fifty years, the school was based in what is now called the Old School House, or \\"OSH\\", the former manor house of Holt overlooking the Market Place in the town centre. In 1708, the school escaped a major fire which destroyed most of the rest of the mediaeval town of Holt. This resulted in most of the buildings now to be seen in the town centre belonging to the 18th century. In 1729, the Fishmongers' Company presented the school with \\"...a valuable and useful library, not only of the best editions of the Classics and Lexicographers, but also with some books of Antiquities, Chronology, and Geography, together with a suitable pair of globes\\".Monroe, Paul, ed. A Cyclopedia of Education (London, Macmillan, 1926), online edition of archive.org By the 18th century, references to fish were hard to find in the court minutes of the Fishmongers' Company, and the company's main business had become managing its extensive property and administering its charities and trusts, such as the school at Holt and St Peter's Hospital, an almshouse at Newington in Surrey. For the period 1704 to 1750, the Rev. Charles Linnell has analysed the 'Status of fathers of boys at Holt Grammar School' in his Gresham's School History and Register (1955): \\"Sons of gentlemen 10%, clergy 30%, professional men 5%, tradesmen 20%, plebeian 15%, unknown 20%\\". One of the school's 18th century heads was John Holmes, appointed at the age of twenty-seven, a prolific writer of educational textbooks who led the school between 1730 and his death in 1760. In the 19th century, boys were strictly required to attend services at the Holt parish church, and in November 1815 a boy called Charles Loynes was \\"expelled for non-attendance at church\\".Lidell, Charles Lawrence Scruton, & A. B. Douglas, The History and Register of Gresham's School, 1555-1954 (Ipswich, 1955), admissions for the year 1810 In 1823, the expenditure of the Fishmongers' Company on the school was £367, of which £158-10s-0d was for the Master's salary, allowances and gratuities, £80 for the Usher's salary, board and lodging, £52-11s-6d for repairs, £22-12s-6d for taxes, £15-15s-6d for poor rates, £12-10s-0d for coals, £9-13s-4d for two-thirds of the cost of the school books, and £6-6s-0d for a School Feast which took place in June. In 1836, the 'Wardens and Commonalty of the Art and Mystery of Fishmongers of the City of London' held an insurance policy for 'Other property or occupiers: Free Grammar School Holt Norfolk (Rev Benn. Pulleyn)' with the Sun Fire Office.MS 11936/540/1172699 at nationalarchives.gov.uk In his History of the Twelve Great Livery Companies of London (1836), William Herbert says of the school: Herbert also notes that the officers of the court of the Fishmongers' Company include \\"a steward of the Holt free school, in Norfolk\\". John William Burgon, in The Life and Times of Sir Thomas Gresham (1839), after listing the estates with which Sir John Gresham endowed the school, says Burgon goes on, however, to add John William Simpson The Old School was rebuilt and converted in 1859. In 1880, a Commission was appointed to enquire into the City of London Livery Companies. When it published its first reports in 1881 the following formed part of a 'Supplementary Statement on behalf of the Fishmongers' Company' included in Volume 1: In the early 1900s, under an ambitious headmaster called George Howson (who had moved to Gresham's from Uppingham), the school expanded onto a new campus of some at the eastern edge of the town,Image of main Gresham's campus at art-e-mail.com . Retrieved 29 August 2007. while keeping the Old School House as one of its houses. When Howson arrived at Gresham's, he found it in numbers much as it had been when founded in 1555: in 1900 there were only forty Holt Scholars, plus seven boarders. The New School (by the architect Sir John Simpson) was opened by Field Marshal Sir Evelyn Wood on 30 September 1903. This consisted of School House (renamed Howson's in 1919) and the Main Building, including Big School. Woodlands was acquired and opened as a new house in 1905, the school's first swimming pool was opened in 1907,The Checkley Collection at holtmuseum.org.uk (accessed 24 May 2008) and Farfield was built in 1911. The School Chapel was completed in 1916, during the Great War, during which one hundred and six Old Greshamians were killed. Under Howson's successor as headmaster, J. R. Eccles, Gresham's appears to have been one of the first schools in England to abolish corporal punishment. In March 1921 Eccles wrote to The Times and \\"condemned corporal punishment of any kind\\".To Cane or Not? in The Times, March 19, 1921 (Issue 42673), p. 7, col. D His letter is not however evidence for permanent abolition at Gresham's. The Thatched Buildings, the gift of Eccles, were opened by Sir Arthur Shipley in February 1921.Gresham's School, Holt: A Wider Curriculum in The Times July 19, 1921 (Issue 42776), p. 8, col. E In 1923, Sir Harry Brittain asked Edward Wood, President of the Board of Education in the House of Commons \\"whether he will explain why Gresham's school, Holt, was admitted to the benefits of the Superannuation Act although it is an endowed school, owning all its buildings and supported by a wealthy city company?\\"Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) for 1923 (H.M. Stationery Office, 1923) p. 1658 A new school library, designed by the architect Alan E. Munby, was opened in 1931 by Field Marshal Lord Milne.The Times, Friday, June 26, 1931; pg. 8; Issue 45859; col F In the 1930s, there were three categories of scholarship in the senior school: Holt A scholarships gave complete exemption from fees, County Scholarships were worth £100 a year, and Fishmongers' Company Open Scholarships were worth £50 a year.The Journal of Education (Oxford University Press, 1933), p. 624 The school was evacuated to Newquay in Cornwall during the Second World War, between June 1940 and March 1944. Martin Burgess's memories of Gresham's during the freezing months of January to March 1947, the coldest British winter on record, are quoted at length in I Will Plant Me a Tree (2002). Not only was the winter icy cold, but because of fuel shortages the school was unheated. Burgess recalls that \\"Periods were held in full overcoats and scarves and gloves. If it happened now the School would be closed, but such a step was not even thought of then. In any case, the roads were blocked... One day the School was called out to dig out a farm, or was it a small village? Hurrah! No periods! In the afternoon everyone prayed there would be periods, it was so cold. A man had died.\\"Benson, Steve, I Will Plant Me a Tree: an Illustrated History of Gresham's School (2002) 85-86 Under the long headship of Logie Bruce Lockhart (1955–1982), there was a further period of change and expansion. Kenwyn, a new Junior School House, was built and opened in 1958. The bridge over the Cromer Road was opened in 1962, and was initiated after the tragic death of Kirsty, LBL's daughter, while crossing Cromer Road in front of Howson's. Tallis, a new boys' house named after John Tallis, Master of the school for more than thirty years in the first half of the seventeenth century, was built and opened in 1963 as were the biology classrooms and music rooms. Oakeley became the first girls' house in 1971, when girls were first admitted to the Sixth Form only. The school became fully co-educational in the 1970s. There are now four boarding houses for boys and three for girls (see \\"Houses\\" section below), as well as a wide range of buildings. These include Big School, the School Chapel, the Auden Theatre, the Cairns Centre, the School Library, the Music Centre, the Central Block, the Thatched Classrooms, the Reith Laboratories, the Biology Building, the Armoury and others. In February 2005, Gresham's School's 450th anniversary was marked by a service at Norwich Cathedral attended by the school's Patron, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and 1,500 past and present Greshamians. In July 2005, the Eastern Daily Press called it \\"a school which changed the world.\\"Eastern Daily Press, Norwich, July 2005 When Philip John, formerly head of King William's College, arrived to take over the headmastership in September 2008, the Tatler Schools Guide commented \\"It will be interesting to observe the impact of mathematician Philip John.\\"Gresham’s School at guides.tatler.co.uk.

Houses Farfield Most Gresham's students are boarders and live in one of the school's seven houses. Four of these are for boys: Howson's (1903), Woodlands (1905), Farfield (1911), and Tallis (1961). Three houses are for girls: Oakeley (1971), Edinburgh (1987), and Britten (1992)- renamed Queens' (2017). Edinburgh was opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the school's Patron, after whom it is named. Britten, named after the composer Benjamin Britten who boarded at the school 1928–30, is an extension of the former school Sanatorium, designed by William Henry Ansell. Britten was often ill and did much early composition in the Sanatorium, including A Hymn to the Virgin.Kennedy, Michael, Britten (J. M. Dent, London: 1981), p. 7 Britten House changed its name to Queens’ House in September 2016. It is named after Queen Mary I, Queen Elizabeth I and Queen Elizabeth II.

There are house teams for team sports, as well as other house activities, such as evening prayers, \\"prep\\", and dramatic productions. Most houses are around seventy strong.Gresham's School online Senior boys and girls may be appointed as house prefects. Some of those are then chosen as school prefects, and one in each house as House Captain. The Old School House was previously the whole school, then from 1905 to 1936 the Junior House, then from 1936 to 1993 a boarding house of the Senior School and is now the home of the Gresham's pre-preparatory school. Junior Schools The Old School House and new war memorial, 1921 The former Junior School of Gresham's was reorganised into a Preparatory School and a Pre-Preparatory School in 1984, both on their own sites at Holt, with their own heads and staff. Like the Senior School, both are fully co-educational. The Prep school has over two hundred children between the ages of seven and thirteen and takes full and weekly boarders as well as day pupils. Many continue into the Senior School. The school's Kenwyn House was once a house of the Senior School called Bengal Lodge. The Pre-Preparatory School is housed in the Old School House and is a day school for approximately one hundred boys and girls between the ages of two and seven. Admission to the school Pupils applying for Year 9 are invited to come in during the Lent (spring) term for an assessment day. Written reports from the pupil's current school and a reference are also used in the assessment process. Entry to the Sixth Form (Year 12) is dependent upon the candidate's school reports, interview, predicted GCSE grades and a reference from the candidate's current school. Curriculum The school teaches most subjects of the mainstream humanistic curriculum. While only limited choices between courses need to be made for GCSE, in the Sixth form at A-level pupils choose three or four subjects, and most combinations are possible. * Latin and Greek * Modern Languages: French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Japanese * English language and literature * Mathematics * Physics, Chemistry, Biology * Computer Science, Art and Design History of Art * History, Geography, Politics, Economics, Business Studies * Religious Studies and Philosophy Psychology * Theatre Studies, Music Physical Education The school has been an International Baccalaureate World School (IB code 003433), offering the IB Diploma Programme, since February 2007.*Gresham's at the International Baccalaureate Organization . Retrieved 15 August 2007. The aim of the school is to give a good all-round education and to prepare pupils for university entry and for other careers, such as the armed forces. Most Greshamians move on to renowned British universities, such as Oxford, Cambridge, Warwick, St Andrews, Bristol, Durham, York and Edinburgh. School terms The school's year is divided into three terms, Michaelmas (early September to mid December), Lent (early January to the Easter holiday) and Summer (the Easter holiday to mid July). In the middle of each term there is a half-term holiday, usually a week long. For boarders, there are also other home weekends. The academic year begins with the Michaelmas term and ends with the summer term, so starts at the end of the summer holiday. School sports Gresham's School bronze medal for sports, dated 1900 Apart from its sports grounds for cricket, rugby, hockey and football, the school has its own indoor swimming pool, squash, tennis and badminton courts, gymnasium, sports hall, music school (Britten Building) and extensive school woods with an outdoor activity centre. It owns a boat-house at Barton Broad and a shooting lodge at Bisley, as well as a shooting range at the school. The principal school sports for boys are rugby (Michaelmas Term), hockey (Lent Term) and cricket, tennis and athletics (summer term) and for girls hockey (Michaelmas Term), netball (Lent Term) and cricket, tennis and athletics (summer term). There is a wide range of other school sports, including badminton, football, squash, golf, martial arts, swimming, sailing, cross-country running, shooting and canoeing. An Old Greshamian, Richard Leman, was a member of the gold-medal winning British hockey squad at the 1988 Summer Olympics and of the bronze-medal winning team at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Another OG, Gawain Briars, was the British number one squash player and now heads the world Professional Squash Association. Brother and sister Ralph and Natasha Firman are both racing drivers, and Natasha was the winner of the inaugural Formula Woman championship in 2004. Giles Baring and Andrew Corran were first-class cricketers, while international rugby footballers include Andy Mulligan (Ireland) and the British and Irish Lions, Nick Youngs (England and his sons Ben and Tom (England) both also playing for the British and Irish Lions winning team in Australia in 2013). In rifle-shooting, Gresham's has been one of the top ten schools in England for about sixty years, and Glyn Barnett won a shooting Gold Medal in the 2006 Commonwealth Games at Melbourne. In the field of winter sports, the 11th Earl of Northesk took an Olympic medal for toboganning (then called 'skeleton') in 1928. Notable mountaineers have included Tom Bourdillon, Sir Percy Wyn-Harris, Peter Lloyd and Matthew Dickinson. Religion Gresham's is a Church of England foundation, but the school is open to all denominations and religions. Services are a focal point of the school's life, with a morning assembly in chapel on four mornings of the week. Pupils not in the Sixth form have an extra morning in chapel, whilst the sixth form have another tutor period (Thursday morning). All years have a tutor period on Tuesday and Thursday. The Saturday morning service is a choral practice, and Holy Communion may be taken on Sundays. There are also formal prayers in most boarding houses in the evenings.

Combined Cadet Force Gresham's has a long military tradition, from Sir Christopher Heydon, who took part in the capture of Cádiz in 1596, to Tom Wintringham, commander of the British Battalion of the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War, and General Sir Robert Bray, Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe. Before the Second World War, the school had an Officers Training Corps. During the 1940s, OTCs in British schools were renamed 'Junior Training Corps', and the school's JTC was amalgamated into the Combined Cadet Force in April, 1948, which continues to provide military training. The CCF's Army section is now associated with the 1st Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment (previously with the Royal Norfolk Regiment, to 1959, and the 1st East Anglian Regiment, 1959 to 1964) and has some 270 pupils as cadets. About another 130 are in the CCF's Air section, and training takes place on Friday afternoon of each week. Activities include shooting, expeditions, combat manoeuvres, ambush and continuity drills, signals training, orienteering, climbing, kayaking, line-laying, first aid and lifesaving, motor mechanics and hovercraft construction. A Biennial Review of the Gresham's School CCF Contingent was carried out on 10 May 2006 by General Sir Richard Dannatt KCB CBE MC, Commander-in-Chief Land Command and Chief of the General Staff designate.

All of the schools were ordered to abandon the practice of exchanging information on their planned fees. Governing body More than half of the school's Governing Body represent the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers, who have been the school's trustees since 1555. The Chairman of Governors (currently Michael Goff)List of governors of Gresham's School at gresham's.com was until recently always a past or present Prime Warden of the Fishmongers' Company. A previous Chairman was the late Rear-Admiral Earl Cairns, after whom the school's Cairns Centre is named. The present Prime Warden, Sir Richard Carew Pole, is also a governor. The governing body includes a representative of Cambridge University, currently Lady Perry of Southwark and one of Norfolk County Council, and it also seeks to include some distinguished Old Greshamians. The Clerk of the Fishmongers' Company also acts as Clerk to the Governing Body, and its meetings are held at Fishmongers' Hall in the City of London. The Grasshopper The Gresham grasshopper The Grasshopper is used as the badge of several Gresham's School clubs, and a long-established school periodical is called The Grasshopper. The green insect appears as the crest above the school's coat of arms, commemorating the Founder, Sir John Gresham, whose family crest it was. The Gresham Grasshopper is also used by Gresham College and can be seen as the weathervane on the Royal Exchange in the City of London, founded in 1565 by Gresham's nephew Sir Thomas Gresham, and the similar weathervane on the Faneuil Hall in Boston, Massachusetts, which is modelled on the Royal Exchange's. The first Royal Exchange was profusely decorated with grasshoppers. According to an ancient legend of the Greshams, the founder of the family, Roger de Gresham, was a foundling abandoned as a new-born baby in long grass in North Norfolk in the 13th century and found there by a woman whose attention was drawn to the child by a grasshopper. Although this is a beautiful story, it is more likely that the grasshopper is simply an heraldic rebus on the name Gresham, with gres being a Middle English form of grass (Old English grœs). In the system of English heraldry, the grasshopper is said to represent wisdom and nobility.Symbolisms of Heraldry at digiserve.com. Retrieved 9 October 2007. Development and external relations During the celebrations of the school's 450th year in 2005, the establishment was announced of a Foundation to focus on encouraging legacies and donations for scholarships, bursaries and specific major projects.

Life He was born in Dumfries and educated locally before being sent to the University of Edinburgh to study Law. He became a member of the Faculty of Advocates in 1840 and was also called to the English bar. He held the judicial offices of Sheriff of Inverness in 1853–1860 and Haddington and Berwick in 1860–1862.https://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSob;=c&GSsr;=281&GScid;=2329319&GRid;=145844477&df;=all& He was appointed Solicitor General for Scotland in 1862–1866 and 1868–1869.

This role is primarily one of law-making.Edinburgh: A History of the City by Michael Fry He represented Wigtown Burghs in 1865–1874, until he lost an election. After an election petition, that election was declared void and the seat awarded to Young on 28 May 1874. However, in June 1874, he was appointed a Judge of the Court of Session and left Parliament. On 3 March 1874 he was created a Senator of the College of Justice with the title Lord Young. He served until 1905. He lived his final years at 28 Moray Place on the prestigious Moray Estate in western Edinburgh.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1905-6 He is buried with his wife Janet Bell (d. 1901), daughter of George Graham Bell, near the south- west corner of St John's churchyard in Edinburgh. Given his wealth and power it is a very humble grave. Legislation The most important legislation framed and created by Lord Young was the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 under which every town and village in Scotland were obliged to give free education to both boys and girls from the age of five to the age of eleven. This created a wave of school building across Scotland. Whilst children were still permitted to attend private schools they were not permitted to attend no school, and also imbedded in this legislation is the creation of the concept of truancy. Family He married Janet Graham Bell on 18 July 1847. They had 14 children: Janet 1848-? Alexander 1849-71 who died aged 22 leaving a succession problem for his lordship George Graham Bell 1850–1905.

Personal life Clark was born in 1935 and graduated from Garden City High School in 1953. Clark graduated from Yale College in 1957 where he was a member of Skull and Bones.https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_skullbones04a.htm Clark earned a master's degree from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. Career As Director of Undergraduate Admissions (1965-1969) at Yale University, Clark oversaw the school's transition to a coeducational admission policy, and shares credit with Yale President Kingman Brewster for establishing academic credentials in the admissions process. Clark was academic dean at Trumbull College, one of the twelve residential colleges constituent to Yale College, 1963 - 1965. For decades prestigious northeastern colleges had used \\"character\\" as a code word to limit the number of acceptances afforded to secondary school students with Jewish and working class Catholic backgrounds to colleges traditionally defined by an Episcopalian or WASP social standard. Negroes were invisible on campus. Associated with this move, Yale, followed by other prestigious colleges in the northeast section of the United States, recruited for the first time beyond the prep school orbit of New England and mid-Atlantic boarding schools, and private schools in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C.. This new policy is now a standard in their respective admissions practices. Headmaster and President (1970-1991) of the Horace Mann School in the Bronx, New York, Clark reintroduced co-education and oversaw the school's merger with the Barnard School. His obituary, published August 7, 1999 in The New York Times, read: \\"a brilliant, dynamic teacher, he taught an Urban History course and took students into prisons and courtrooms to learn first hand about the complex urban issues confronting New York City. His inspirational leadership, his ebullient personality...His impressive intellect and passion for baseball are legendary.\\" Horace Mann School pedophilia scandal A cover feature was published in The New York Times Sunday magazine, datelined 6 June 2012, that reports on many years that faculty members practiced pedophilia among the Horace Mann School student body while Clark was Headmaster and President. Clark was described as one of many teachers and administrators implicated in the criminal behavior and resultant coverup. Clark is acknowledged as a member of the cohort of homosexual and heterosexual pedophiles described in the resultant legal proceedings. In March 2013, the school, with legal and other counsel, settled many claims brought by victims of sexual abuse during many of the years Clark was associated with Horace Mann School. The New Yorker, datelined April 1, 2013, presented further reportage on pedophilia at Horace Mann School during Clark's tenure. The REPORTER AT LARGE feature was authored by Marc Fisher, an alumnus of Horace Mann School. Efforts to rename the school's main athletic field, at present named in honor of Clark, have been successful. Alumni Field was voted the preferred new name.

Name It is viewed by some Egyptologists such as Brugsch that the name of the city derives from the ancient Egyptian word grg miri-amoun Ramessou which means \\"The establishment of Ramesses II\\", although Daressy and Budge identify the name with Coptic Balyana near Abydos. Overview Girga was the capital of the Girga Governorate until 1960, when the capital was moved to Sohag and the name of the governorate changed accordingly. Girga has an estimated population of 71,564 (as of 1986) and has various economic industries which include cane sugar manufacturing and pottery. Near the city there is a monastery dedicated to St. George from which local folklore derives the name of the city. Also the city has another monastery, the el-Sini is reportedly the oldest Roman Catholic monastery ever built in Egypt. Girga has also been famed for its landscape, the beautiful paved Suq, and the el-Sini (Porcelain Mosque), which is reportedly the oldest known Roman Catholic monastery and was almost swept away by the Nile at one time. History The city was home and headquarters of the first Pharaoh of a unified Egypt, Narmer. As of today, it is unconfirmed to whether this is the site of the ancient city of This (Thinis) or the nearby village of Birba which was the capital of Egypt during the 1st and 2nd dynasties. Also neighbouring Girga is the ancient sites including Beit Khallaf, a necropolis where tourists can find mudbrick tombs dating back to the 3rd dynasty.

Lotus Isle spread out over and at the time was Portland's largest amusement park. History Lotus Isle Amusement Park opened on June 28, 1930 after a group of investors realized the success of the nearby Jantzen Beach Amusement Park. At the time of its opening, Lotus Isle was the largest amusement park in Oregon. The park consisted of forty attractions including bumper cars, a rollercoaster, and a dance hall called the Peacock Ballroom. On August 28, 1930, an eleven-year-old boy drowned at the Lotus Isle beach after slipping from a ladder beneath the park's main diving board. Edwin F. Platt, the park's owner, committed suicide the day after the drowning. Platt \\"spent a fortune\\" in constructing Lotus Isle, which cost between $500,000 and $600,000. According to The Oregonian, finances were given consideration in the inquiry following Platt's death. Business at the park had not been as brisk as its investors had hoped for, and it experienced \\"internal discord\\" such as the discharge of its manager, T. H. Eslick, who later sued the park for violating the agreement whereby he was brought on as manager. For the following season, a promoter named Al Painter took over management of the park, and created a \\"Dance-A-Thon\\" event in the park's Peacock Ballroom, which held room for 6,600 dancers. During this time, John Ringling sold Lotus Isle a temperamental bull elephant named \\"Tusko\\" who soon destroyed several pavilions after being spooked by a low-flying stunt plane. The elephant, which had previously rampaged through Sedro-Wooley, Washington, eventually ended up in Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo. On August 24, 1931, almost a year after the drowning and Platt's suicide, the Peacock Ballroom burned to the ground. The park operated once more in the 1932 season before going into bankruptcy, after which liquidation of the park property began.

If a pinealoma destroys the cells of the pineal gland in a child, it can cause precocious puberty. Signs and symptoms The pineal gland produces the hormone melatonin which plays a role in regulating circadian rhythms. A pinealoma may disrupt production of this hormone, and insomnia may result. Frequently, paralysis of upward gaze along with several ocular findings such as convergence retraction nystagmus and eyelid retraction also known as Collier's sign and Light Near Dissociation (pupil accommodates but doesn't react to light) are known collectively as Parinaud's syndrome or Dorsal Mid-brain syndrome, are the only physical symptoms seen. This is caused by the compression of the vertical gaze center in the midbrain tectum at the level of the superior colliculus and cranial nerve III. Work-up usually includes Neuro-imaging as seen on the right. A pinealoma may cause interruption of hypothalamic inhibiting pathways, sometimes leading to beta- hCG secretion and consequent Leydig's cell stimulation (endocrine syndrome). Other symptoms may include hydrocephalus, gait disturbances, and precocious puberty. Cause Pinealomas can be due to proliferation of primary pineocytes (pineocytomas, pineoblastomas), astrocytes (astrocytoma), or germ cells (germinoma).

The Kurdish culture is a legacy from ancient peoples who shaped modern Kurds and their society. Kurds are people living in western Asia in the north of the Middle East along the Zagros Mountains and the Taurus Mountains in the region that the Kurds call Greater Kurdistan. Today they are parts of north- eastern Iraq, north-west of Iran and North East of Syria and southeast Turkey. In addition to these areas, the Kurds are present in a few numbers in south- western Armenia and some areas of Azerbaijan and Lebanon. Miscellaneous A grandma and her grandchild watching the “Nowruz” ceremony. There is a lot of controversy about the Kurdish people from their origins, their history, and even their political future. This historical controversy has intensified in recent years, especially after the changes in the reality of the Kurds in Iraq following the Second Gulf War, and the formation of the United States of the no-fly zone that led to the emergence of the Kurdistan region in northern Iraq. Kurds are one of the ethnic groups that do not have an independent state recognized universally. Language Kurdish (کوردی, Kurdî) is part of the North-Western division of the Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. Basic languages: sorani and kurmanji In various forms: Sorani, Armenian, Vile, Southern Kurdish, Royal, Zacakian, Bajelian, and Gorani Other languages: Arabic, Turkish, Persian There are more than 30 million speakers of Kurdish in the Kurdistan region. Kurdish is written in the Arabic alphabet in Iraq and Syria, the adapted Arabic alphabet in Iran and the Latin script in Turkey. Because they are both part of the same language family, according to Izady, \\"Many Kurdish words are cognate to English, such as gama = game, mâra = marry, stâra = star, rubâr = river, dol = dale or valley, brâ = brother, mong = moon, snoy = snow, firo = free (of charge), standin = to stand, sur = sure, and the like.\\" There are three main dialects: Kurmanji, Soriani and Pehlewani. Folklore The Kurds have a rich folkloric tradition which is increasingly endangered as a result of modernization, urbanization, and cultural repression. =Zembilfrosh= Zembilfrosh (Kurdish for \\"basket seller\\") is a folktale popular in Turkish Kurdistan and Iraqi Kurdistan. Zembilfrosh was the son of a powerful Kurdish ruler who left his home and life behind to seek a spiritual life as a dervish. He wanders the countryside with his faithful wife, surviving by making and selling baskets. One day they arrive in the capital of a Kurdish emirate, where the prince's wife sees Zembilfrosh and falls in love with him. She summons him to the castle, where she declares her love for him and tries to seduce him. Zembilfrosh declines, but she presses, promising him many riches. Zembilfrosh is not persuaded and she locks him in a castle tower, from which he eventually escapes. The prince's wife then disguises herself and starts searching for Zembilfrosh, and eventually finds him. She then deceives Zembilfrosh's wife, convincing her to lend her her clothes and leave the house. When Zembilfrosh returns that night, it is dark and he does not recognize the prince's wife, who welcomes him into bed. However, a silver anklet gives her away, and he runs off, chased after by his would-be-lover. As Zembilfrosh sees that escape is impossible, he prays to God, supplicating to be released from a world of misery, and God complies. Reaching Zembilfrosh's lifeless body, the prince's wife is so heartbroken that she dies as well. They are then buried side by side. Their resting place is claimed to be located at the contemporary town of Batifa, a subdistrict of the district of Zakho, Duhok governorate, in Iraqi Kurdistan.Christiane Bird, A Thousand Sighs, a Thousand Revolts: Journeys in Kurdistan, Ballantine Books, 2004, , (see pp 149-150) Music Kurdish folk music is an important part of Kurdish culture and has traditionally been used to transmit stories about Kurdish history by Dengbêj (bards). According to thekurdishproject.org, 'The word ‘deng’ means voice and ‘bej’ means ‘to sing.’ Dengbej are best known for their “stran,” or song of mourning.' Many popular Kurdish musicians of the 20th century like Hassan Zirak and Ahmet Kaya sang in Turkish or Persian as well as in Kurdish. Apart from the language it is sung in, Western Kurdish music has a more Anatolian, Turkish, Greek or Balkan sound, whereas Southern Kurdish music is influenced by Arab musical styles, Eastern Kurdish music by Persian styles and North-Eastern by Armenian and Caucasian styles. Cuisine Traditional Kurdish food Food is widely recognised to be a fundamental part of what it means to be Kurdish. Foods such as Dolma (rice stuffed in grape leaves), kfta (spiced minced meat cased in thin layer of mashed pudding rice), Ser u pe (goats head, tongue and feet), shifta (meat patties), are traditional Kurdish foods. Lamb and chicken have been staple meats in Kurdish cuisine for centuries. Vegetables, pilaf and dairy products also comprise a large portion of traditional Kurdish food. Tea is also staple to a Kurdish diet. It is commonly drunk 2-3 times a day, commonly a social activity. Kurds also drink Mastaw/Do'h/Ayran, a yogurt-based drink. Religion The Kurdish people have different religions depending on the country in which they live in or they have cultural and ethnic links to that religion, the most common religion among Kurds is Sunni Islam, practiced by 98% of Kurds living in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Kurds of Turkey are 30% Alevi out of a population of approximately 15-22 million Kurds and 68% follow Sunni Islam.

He was born in Philadelphia into an immigrant Orthodox Jewish family. As an adolescent, he began to reject religious orthodoxy in favor of Liberal Judaism. He studied in New York City, before being ordained in 1961. The same year he moved to England to do post-graduate work at University College London and also became Associate Minister of the Liberal Jewish Synagogue in St John's Wood. In 1964 he became the first Executive Director of (as it was then) the Union of Liberal and Progressive Synagogues, now known as Liberal Judaism. Brichto was also a prolific author, having written extensively in the Jewish and national press. One of his last projects, called The People's Bible, was the publishing of a series of new translations of the Bible, both the Old and New Testaments. Rabbi Brichto believed that the concept of God is more important than questions of His existence. Equally, the Bible is relevant not because of the veracity of its stories, but because of the morality of its myths. His translations aimed to achieve accessibility as literature, and to do this, he controversially added sections to improve readability and removed large areas of non-consequential material to the appendices.Review by Mary Kenny in the Daily Express, 3 May 2000 His published works included: *The New Testament (A new translation and modern explanation, ) *Genesis (the book of Genesis, ) *The Conquest of Canaan (the books of Judges and Joshua, ) *Samuel (the two Books of Samuel, ) *Song of Songs (the books The Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Esther, ) *St. Luke & The Apostles (the Gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles, ) *The Genius of Paul (the letters of Paul, ) *Moses (divided into Book 1: Moses, Man of Godand Book 2: The Laws of Moses) (the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, ) *Apocalypse (Gospel of John and Book of Revelation, ) Rabbi Brichto also wrote a guide to Jews and Jewish life, Funny ... you don't look Jewish () in which he explored, among other things, anti- Jewish prejudices against the reality of Jewish culture and life. His autobiography, Ritual Slaughter: Growing Up Jewish in America (), provided detailed information of Rabbi Brichto's upbringing and move away from Orthodoxy.

His father, Percy Orthwein, was an advertising executive. His mother, Clara Busch, was the granddaughter of Adolphus Busch, the German-born founder of Anheuser-Busch. Orthwein was educated at the Choate School in Wallingford, Connecticut. He graduated from Washington University in St. Louis.

In 1997, Orthwein held 1.6 million shares in Anheuser-Busch, more than any other company insider with the exception of his first cousin, chairman and president August Busch III.Manning, Margie (December 19, 1997). Orthwein cuts A-B holdings.St. Louis Business Journal Orthwein was a co-founder of Huntleigh Asset Partners, a private investment firm, in 1983. It was later renamed Precise Capital. Orthwein purchased the New England Patriots from Victor Kiam in 1992, when the latter was facing bankruptcy and owed him millions. The purchase price was $106 million. During his ownership, Orthwein hired Bill Parcells as head coach and oversaw the drafting of first-overall draft pick quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who helped to return the moribund franchise to respectability. He planned to relocate the Patriots franchise to St. Louis, renaming the team the St. Louis Stallions. However, those plans were derailed when Boston paper magnate Robert Kraft, owner of Foxboro Stadium, refused to accept a buyout of the lease. Kraft used his ownership of the stadium to stage a hostile takeover, offering to pay $175 million for the Patriots franchise knowing that Orthwein no longer wanted the team if he could not move it to St. Louis. Although future St. Louis/Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke offered to buy the team for $200 million and move it to St. Louis, Orthwein would have been saddled with all relocation expenses. He also would have been responsible for any legal expenses as well, and Kraft had already made it clear that he would go to court to enforce the lease. With no other choice, Orthwein accepted Kraft's bid on January 21, 1994. Personal life and death One of Orthwein's wives was Romaine Dahlgren Pierce, who had previously married and divorced William Simpson and David Mountbatten, 3rd Marquess of Milford Haven. Orthwein's third wife was Ruth Orthwein; they divorced in the late 1990s. Orthwein died of cancer at his home in Huntleigh, Missouri in 2008.

The program continues in the early 21st century. That year, NC State College administrators approved construction of a reactor and the establishment of a collegiate nuclear engineering program. The first research reactor was completed in 1953; it was scaled up in 1957 and 1960 (referred to as R-1, R-2, and R-3). It was deactivated in 1973 to make way for the PULSTAR reactor. The old reactor has been decommissioned. The PULSTAR is used for a variety of purposes, including training and research. The reactor is located in Burlington Engineering laboratories on NCSU's main campus. This facility was built to house the first reactor and then expanded and renamed when the PULSTAR was built. The current reactor is one of two PULSTAR reactors built, and the only one still in operation. The other reactor was a 2 MW reactor at the State University of New York at Buffalo. It went critical in 1964 and was decommissioned in 1994.IAEA Database of Reactors , data from 2002-09-04 Current reactor operations NC State's Pulstar Nuclear Reactor. The PULSTAR reactor is situated along Engineering Row in the main campus, surrounded by Mann Hall, Daniels, Polk Hall, and a park. The reactor has a dedicated building and uses one cooling tower; it releases water vapor when the reactor is at high power. This building is not a Containment building, but it maintains a negative pressure to prevent any release of radioactive material. The reactor can be operated up to a power of 100 kW on natural circulation, or 1 Megawatt (MW) with the use of pumps. The reactor enriches the department curricula by providing hands on experience as well as training for students. In 2002, department enrollment was 72 total undergraduate students, 15 masters students, and 22 PhD students, all of whom use the reactor. Additionally, 34 researches outside of Nuclear Engineering use the reactor and associated facilities. The primary research purpose of the reactor is to provide a neutron source for activities such as Neutron activation analysis. For example, cobalt-60 irradiators are used by a number of departments to sterilize biological samples. It is also used for professional training for nuclear utility operators and engineers, DOE Interns, and State and local radiation protection personnel. This reactor is well suited for duplicating the fuel performance of power reactors. The core consists of low- enriched Uranium pins intended to be very similar to what is used in commercial nuclear power plants. Five beam ports are adjacent to the core of the reactor. This reactor is well suited for experiments requiring a large neutron flux because peaking occurs around the edge of the core due to under moderation. In September 2007, students, faculty and staff produced the most intense operating positron beam anywhere in the world.Dave Pond, NCSU, Innovation-Discovery, October 2007 The PULSTAR reactor is a public facility and gives frequent tours with advance notice and clearance. In November 2010, the PULSTAR reactor was linked to the nuclear engineering department of Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST). =Incidents= A water leak was detected in the pool, and the reactor was subsequently shut down on July 2, 2011. The leak rate was said to be (out of a ), which is far below the that is mandated to be officially reported to the regulator. The leak was said to be \\"pinhole\\" size and required special equipment to detect. After the leak was located and repaired, technicians returned the reactor to normal operations. Early history The first reactor was a part of a 1-story building called Burlington Nuclear Laboratories at the time and currently referred to as the old building of the Burlington Engineering Labs, which has classrooms surrounding the reactor bay. The old building is still in use with the reactor bay housing various new projects. The reactor itself has been completely decommissioned and moved out. =R-1= In 1949, Dr. Clifford K. Beck was recruited from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to join the faculty with plans to make NCSU the first academic institution to operate a nuclear reactor. The first reactor at an academic institution went critical on September 5, 1953, approximately four years after construction had been started. This reactor was dubbed R-1 because it was the first university research reactor. It was a 10 kW, homogeneous reactor using highly enriched Uranyl Sulfate as fuel. It operated for a short time but was shut down due to corrosion problems that lead to fuel leakage. Howard Blakeslee, science editor of Associated Press Service, called the reactor the First Temple of the Atom because of the public nature of this reactor. In 1954 construction of Burlington Nuclear Laboratory began with funds from the AEC and Burlington Mills. The purpose of this building was to house the successor to the R-1. Also in 1954 the first two PhDs in Nuclear Engineering were presented.State Nuclear Industry - North Carolina In 1955, Dr. Raymond L. Murray, another recruit from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, joined the faculty, who later became the longest serving department head. =R-3= In 1956 work to build a heterogeneous reactor called R-3 began. This design was to use Materials Test Reactor plate-type fuel in Burlington Nuclear Labs. This reactor operated at a maximum power of 100 kW. In the late 1950s, Dr. Raymond L. Murray became head of the Applied Physics department where he also provided leadership to the beginning of a nuclear engineering educational program. The decision was made to offer the first B.S. degree in Nuclear Engineering in the nation. In 1956 Clifford Beck departed the program to accept a position with the Atomic Energy Commission in Washington. Raymond Murray and Professor Harold Lammonds assumed supervision of the nuclear program. Between 1962 and 1964, the shielding of the R-3 reactor was extended to allow operation at higher power levels and this improved reactor began operation in 1963, operating at a steady-state power level of 250 kW. This reactor became a major part of the nuclear engineering instructional program and also began to provide some services in radioisotope production and neutron activation analysis. In 1963 Raymond Murray resigned his position as head of Applied Physics to become Department Head of Nuclear Engineering. Simultaneous with this decision, the Nuclear Engineering Department was transferred from Applied Physics into the School of Engineering, then headed by Dr. Ralph E. Fadum, Dean. Through the late 1960s and early 1970s the Air Force and Army began to send qualified students to the program to obtain M.S. degrees and later staff the nuclear programs in their own organizations. In the 70's, the NESEP program (Naval Enlisted Scientific Education Program) brought a number of well qualified enlisted men into the nuclear program to earn undergraduate degrees and a number of foreign countries contributed students to earn BS, MS or PhD degrees and then return to their respective countries. By the time of shutdown, the reactor had achieved a total of 2 Megawatt-days of operation.www- pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/D446_web/6_DD_Table.pdf History after construction of the PULSTAR View looking down on the reactor pool Internal discussions within Nuclear Engineering addressed the choices of upgrading the R-3 reactor for both teaching and research or shutting it down to replace it with an entirely new reactor. Dr. Martin Welt championed the latter point of view, and this position was adopted by the department. A new 3-story addition to Burlington Labs was constructed (known as the new building). Between it and the old building, a reactor building was constructed, along with a loading dock and walkway that bridged the old and new buildings. The reactor building housed the 1 MW pool nuclear reactor manufactured by AMF and known as the \\"Pulstar\\" reactor. It was named for its pulsing ability, by which it can safely become super prompt critical and produce very short pulses of radiation. The reactor became operational August 25, 1972, replacing the previous series. The initial costs were reported to be 1.5 M US$. In the 1980s a Prompt Gamma facility and a Neutron Radiography facility were added. The prompt gamma facility performs the analysis of elements that emit characteristic signatures immediately on neutron capture. The Neutron Radiography facility provides imaging capabilities to the fundamental difference in the interaction of neutrons with nuclei in comparison to the interaction of x-rays and electrons.Nuclear Reactor Program In 1997 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a 20-year license extension. The Pulstar reactor is currently running at 1MW which is the maximum power output that it can legally reach. It has plans to move up to 2 MW in the future. Preparations are done and all they are waiting for is approval. Moving to 2 MW will allow for more research to undergo with more radiation and power. Facilities =Neutron Imaging Facility= Neutron radiography is a powerful non-destructive imaging technique for the internal evaluation of materials or components. It involves the attenuation of a neutron beam by an object to be radiographed, and registration of the attenuation process (as an image) digitally or on film. Neutron radiography is similar in principle to X-ray radiography, and is complementary in the nature of information supplied. The interactions of X-rays and neutrons with matter are fundamentally different, however, forming the basis of many unique applications using neutrons. While X-rays interact with the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus of an atom, neutrons interact with the nucleus itself. For more information see neutron radiology. =Ultra Cold Neutron Source= The Ultra Cold Neutron Source (UCNS) uses neutrons produced in the reactor by slowing them down through a chamber of methane and other materials and holds them in a tank of D2O. This addition is essentially a tap of neutrons from a beamport adjacent to the reaction to do this research.

Humphreys Bridge was a two-lane cantilevered truss bridge carrying U.S. Route 82/U.S. Route 278 across the Mississippi River between Lake Village, Arkansas and Greenville, Mississippi. It was the first bridge to connect the two towns. The bridge was named for Benjamin G. Humphreys II, a former United States Congressman from Greenville. Hailed as progressive when it opened in 1940, it became functionally obsolete as vehicle and river traffic increased. Because of its narrow two lanes with no shoulders, the bridge often became blocked by accidents or by the crossing of large vehicles like farm equipment. Due to its location near a sharp bend in the Mississippi River, the bridge became a hazard to river traffic; barges and towboats frequently collided with it. In 1994, a study concluded that a new bridge was needed and the old one should be torn down. In 2010, a new bridge, the Greenville Bridge, was opened as a replacement further downriver from the sharp bend. In 2011, work began to remove the Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge. Description The Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge, very modern in its time, was a two lane, steel cantilevered truss bridge that carried US 82/278 over the Mississippi River, and connected the towns of Lake Village, Arkansas and Greenville, Mississippi by road for the first time. Prior to the bridge, local vehicles and local freight could only cross the river by ferry. It was named after Benjamin G. Humphreys, a US Congressman from Greensville who co-authored a flood control bill in 1917 establishing a national flood control program on the Mississippi and promoted the concept of flood control to contain the river. The bridge opened on October 4, 1940 to great fanfare. Its main span width was , the highway bridge with the longest span on the Mississippi River. The width of the roadway was --two lanes of each with no shoulders. Both the original bridge and its replacement are geographically mostly in Arkansas, as the state lines were determined prior to the shift west of the Mississippi River. History In the late 1930s, talk started on the construction of a bridge to cross the Mississippi River at Greenville. In 1936, a group called the Arkansas-Mississippi-Alabama US 82 Association was formed to raise funds for the bridge. In 1937, Milton C. Smith (the mayor at that time) worked with John A. Fox, (the secretary of the Washington County Chamber of Commerce), to get Congress to pass a law authorizing the bridge. The bill authorizing the bridge was signed into law in August 1937 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1938, Smith applied for money from the Works Progress Administration to fund the estimated $4.5 million it would take to build the bridge. The Works Progress Administration agreed to the proposal in September 1938 and construction started on the bridge a few months later. 3-D artistic prototype of the new bridge with the Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge and the sharp bend in the Mississippi River in the background The Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge was built by the company now known as HNTB and opened to much fanfare in 1940 as the \\"pathway to progress\\" for the Mississippi Delta. It was a through-truss design and had a span of 840 feet (256 meters). Until 1943, this was the longest bridge for vehicles on the Mississippi River. Over time, the bridge supported increasing volumes of highway traffic and vehicles hitting the bridge. In the 1950s, an Air Force plane crashed into the bridge. Though the bridge remained structurally sound, it was becoming functionally obsolete. It had only two narrow highway lanes and no shoulders. An accident or the crossing of very large vehicles such as a large combine could force the bridge to close. With river traffic increasing, damage from barge collisions increased. By 1972, the Greenville Bridge was hit more times by barges than any other bridge on the Mississippi. The bridge was located close to a sharp bend in the Mississippi; towboats and barges had difficulty making the sharp turn and regaining their course in time to avoid a collision with the bridge. Over the years many have not been able to make the turn quickly and have hit it. The bridge had become a danger to river traffic. A 1994 engineering study by the Mississippi Department of Transportation explored alternatives to upgrading the crossing of US 82 and issued a report that explored a four-lane crossing at Greenville. It concluded the best of several alternatives it identified was to build a new bridge downriver from the old one and to remove the old bridge. Additional studies evaluated the type of bridge to build, and by 1995 the cable-stayed bridge was chosen as the best design to fit the river and soil conditions, as well as providing sufficient clearance for river navigation. Engineering plans were completed in 1999 for the Greenville Bridge, its replacement. Destruction The new Greenville Bridge opened to traffic on August 4, 2010. In 2011 the massive process of removing the old bridge by cutting into small sections to be recycled was begun and was completed in September 2012. At times the river was closed to traffic to aid the demolition. The job was dangerous and two workers died during the demolition.

Caste People of this caste are known as Vaishnav Brahmins in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh And Rajasthan. At the beginning of the 20th century, this sect declared to be the descendants of Rāma's sons, Kusha and Lava. Denomination Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana cooking and eating in the Wilderness (picture). The Ramanandi Sampradaya is one of the largest and most egalitarian Hindu sects India, around the Ganges Plain, and Nepal today. It mainly emphasizes the worship of Rāma, as well as Vishnu directly and other incarnations. While considered Vaiṣṇava, the Ramanandi are the largest ascetic group that celebrates the Śivarātri festival, which is dedicated to Shiva. ascetics rely upon meditation and strict ascetic practices, but also believe that the grace of god is required for them to achieve liberation. For that reason, the section of the ascetics, unlike some ascetics, do not cut the sacred thread. Their reasoning for this is that only or can grant liberation. Most Ramanandis consider themselves to be the followers of Ramananda, a Vaishnava saint in medieval India. Philosophically, they are in the Vishishtadvaita (IAST ) tradition of Bhaghavat Ramanuja. Its ascetic wing constitutes the largest Vaishnava monastic order and may possibly be the largest monastic order in all of India. There are two major subgroups of Ramanandi ascetics: the Tyagi, who use ash for initiation, and the Naga, who are the militant wing.  History  Bhaktamal, a gigantic hagiographic work on Hindu saints and devotees written by Raghavadas in 1660, was a core text for all Vaishnavas including Ramanandis. This text lists Ramanuja, expounder of Vishishtadvaita school of Vedanta, and Ramananda as saints of the Ramanuja Sampradaya but Galta peeth of Ramanandi Vaishnavas have ruled out this by prohibiting Ramanuja Vaishnavas from taking Shahi snan in Kumbh Mela. Many localized commentaries of Bhaktakamal were taught to young Vaishnavas across India. In the 19th century, proliferation of the printing press in the Gangetic plains of North India allowed various commentaries of the text to be widely distributed. Of these, Bhagavan Prasad's Shri Bhaktamal: Tika, Tilak, aur Namvali Sahit was considered to be the most authoritative. In this text, Bhagvan Prasad lists 108 prominent Vaishnavas starting with Ramanuja and ending with Ramananda. Ramananda's guru Raghavananda is described as an egalitarian guru who taught students of all castes. Ramananda himself is described as an avatar of Rama, a humble student with great yogic talents who was asked to form his own sampradaya as a punishment by his guru. The text located his birth in Prayag in c. 1300 CE. J.N. Farquhar, a noted missionary and indologist, published his own work on the Ramanandi Sampradaya based on his interaction with various Ramanandis at the Kumbh Mela of 1918. Farquhar credits Ramananda (c. 1400–1470 CE) and his followers as the origin of the North Indian practice of using Ram to refer to the Absolute. Based on the textual evidence and similarity of sect marks between Ramanandis and Sri Vaishnavas, Farquhar concludes that Ramananda migrated to Benares from Tamil Nadu. He acknowledges that Ramananda accepted disciples from all castes and did not observe the restrictions in matters of food. However, Farquhar finds no evidence to show that Ramananda endeavoured to \\"overturn caste as a social institution\\". On the other hand, Sita Ram, author of the Vaishnava history of Ayodhya, and George Grierson, eminent linguist and Indologist, represent Ramananda as saint who tried to transcend caste divisions of medieval India through the message of love and equality. The scholars also disagree on Ramananda's connection with Ramanuja. While Farquhar finds them completely unconnected, Sita Ram and Grierson place Ramananda within the Ramanuja tradition. Up to the nineteenth century, many of the trade routes in northern India were guarded by groups of warrior-ascetics, including the Nāgā sections of the Rāmānandīs, who were feared because of their strength and fearlessness. The British took steps to disarm these militant groups of ascetics, but even today the sects still retain their heroic traditions. Geography Ramanandi live chiefly in the northern part of India. Ramanandi monasteries are found throughout western and central India, the Ganges basin, the Nepalese Terai, and the Himalayan foothills. Ramanandis are spread across India, mainly in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The majority of Hindu immigrants to Trinidad and Tobago belonged to Vaishnava sects such as the Ramanandi. Hindus in Trinidad and Tobago currently practice based on the teachings of Ramananda. Saints Saints Dhanna and Pipa were among the immediate disciples of Ramananda. Hymns written by them find mention in the Adi Granth, holy scripture of the Sikhs. Sects founded by saints Raidas, Sena and Maluk Das are also of a direct Ramanandi origin. The poet-saint Tulsidas, who composed the Ramcharitmanas, was a member of this sect. His writings made Vishnu and Shiva devotees of each other and thereby bridged the gap between Vaishnavas and Shaivites. Because Tulsidas attempted to reconcile various theologies scholars like Ramchandra Shukla do not agree that he can considered to be a Ramanandi exclusively. Some sources say Jayadeva, who composed the Gita Govinda, was also a member of this sect. Other sources classify Jayadeva simply as a Bengal Vaishnava.

The present version dates from 12 July 1996. As the Isle of Man is a Crown dependency and the present Lord of Man is Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, the arms are more accurately described as the Arms of Her Majesty in right of the Isle of Man.Island Facts (n.d.). The origin of the triskeles (three dexter legs conjoined at the hips and flexed in triangle) is obscure, but it appears to stem from the Scottish takeover of the island in 1265. The heraldic supporters are birds associated with the island, whilst the motto first appears on record in the 17th century. Description The present coat of arms was granted by Queen Elizabeth II, Lord of Mann, on 12 July 1996. The escutcheon is blazoned: Gules three legs in armour flexed at the knee and conjoined at the thigh, all proper, garnished and spurred or. The crest is blazoned: An imperial crown proper. The supporters are blazoned: dexter: A peregrine falcon proper and sinister: A raven proper. The Latin motto is: Quocunque Jeceris StabitIsland Facts (n.d.) (\\"whithersoever you throw it, it will stand\\", or \\"whichever way you throw, it will stand\\".Kinvig (1975) pp. 91–92 This refers to the theoretical aerodynamical properties of the triskele, which will supposedly always have a foot to land on whichever way it lands. The motto dates to 1668 when it is first recorded on coinage of the Isle of Man. Origin quarters: 1:Stanley; 2 & 3: King of Man; 4: Strange of Knockyn, all circumscribed by the Garter. Possibly the arms of Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby (1435-1504), KG The heraldic device of the triskele or triskeles has been associated with the Isle of Man for centuries. In 1405 Henry IV, King of England granted the Isle of Man to John Stanley (–1414), KG (whose eventual successor in 1485 was created Earl of Derby for his services to Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth), for the feudal tenure of grand serjeanty, namely of providing to him a pair of peregrine falcons, also to be provided to every future English king on his coronation. This formal bestowal of a pair of falcons continued until the coronation of George IV in 1822. The Stanley family, Earls of Derby, still display the arms of Man today, quartered by their paternal arms. As does the Murray family, Dukes of Atholl, which quarters Stanley. The raven is a bird strongly associated with Norse mythology, and appears in numerous place names on the island. Rolls of arms Coat of arms of the King of Man depicted on the Wijnbergen Roll of Arms (c.1270-1300) The present coat of arms is an augmentation of honour of the ancient arms of the feudal Lord of Man. It is unknown when the triskeles device was originally adopted as a symbol relating to the Isle of Man.Wilson (2000) p. 35. It appears associated with the Isle in several late 13th-century rolls of arms, such as the Camden Roll, Herald's Roll, Segar's Roll, Walford's Roll, and Wijnbergen Roll, all of which date from 1270-1300.Broderick (2015) p. 1; McAndrew (2006) p. 65; Wilson (2000) p. 36. The coat of arms in Camden Roll is blazoned: L'escu de gules, a(vec) treis jambes armez (\\"'The shield gules with three legs in armour\\").Greenstreet (1882) p. 312. The coat of arms depicted in Walford's Roll is blazoned in Norman-French: De goules a(vec) treys gambes armes o(vec) tucte le guisses et chekun cornere seyt une pee.McAndrew (2006) p. 65. (in modern French: De gules avec trois jambes armées avec tous les cuisses et chaque un coin soit unie - \\"Of gules with three legs in armour with all the thighs and each corner united\\"). The coat of arms in the Wijnbergen Roll is blazoned (translated): Gules, three mailed legs embowed and conjoined at the thighs argent spurred or.Broderick (2015) p. 1 n. 2. Another early example of the coat of arms is preserved in the late 14th century Armorial de Gelre.Broderick (2015) p. 1.group=note}} History =Crovan dynasty= Until 1265 the Isle of Man formed part of the Kingdom of the Isles, ruled by the Crovan dynasty. The last member of that ruling family died in 1265 without a legitimate heir, when the Isle passed into the possession of Alexander III, King of Scotland (d.1286). In 1266 sovereignty of the Isle of Man and the Hebrides was formally transferred from the King of Norway to King Alexander III of Scotland (1241-1286). The heraldic era in England and Scotland started in about 1215, slightly earlier in Western Europe, and members of the Crovan dynasty are known to have borne ships and lions on their seals,Wilson (2000) p. 36. and no evidence exists of their use of the triskeles. It is possible that the origin of the Manx triskeles is a knotted device depicted on the coinage of their 10th-century Viking predecessors on the Isle.McAndrew (2006) p. 65; Wilson (2000) p. 36. However, that device is dissimilar to the Manx triskeles, and the nearly 300-year gap between its use and the appearance of the Manx triskeles suggests that there is no connection between the symbols. =Sicilian connection= Greek tyrant of Syracuse (317–289 BC) and king of Sicily (304–289 BC). Inscription: ΣΥΡΑΚΟΣΙΩΝ (\\"Syrakosion\\") Laureate head of the youthful Ares to left; behind, Palladion. Reverse: Triskeles of three human legs with winged feet; at the center, Gorgoneion heraldic device on the shield of a Greek warrior. Greek Red Figure lekythos vase, c.470 BC, found in a tomb near Licata, Sicily. Archaeological Museum of Syracuse, Sicily The appearance on the Isle of Man of the Triskeles in the last third of the 13th century may well be connected with the regime change on the Isle in 1265, from Crovan to Scots kings. The symbol is anciently closely associated with Sicily, well known as a tri-cornered island, and is attested there in proto-heraldry as early as the 7th century BC.Wilson (2000) pp. 35, 51, 56. The most ancient name for Sicily, then a Greek province was Trinacria,Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, & Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928 meaning in Greek three-cornered, triquetra, referring to the triangular shape of the island.\\"Sicilian Culture: The Folklore, Legends & Traditions: Trinacria.\\" Sicilian Culture: The Folklore, Legends & Traditions: Trinacria. N.p., n.d. Web. 9 November 2014. \\"Sicily.\\" Sicily. N.p., n.d. Web. 10 November 2014. In 1250 the Germanic Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, died after having ruled Sicily for 52 years.Wilson (2000) p. 37. He was King of Sicily from 1198, King of Germany from 1212, King of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor from 1220 and King of Jerusalem from 1225. His mother Constance was Queen of Sicily and his father was Henry VI of the House of Hohenstaufen. Although there is no evidence that the triskeles was used in Sicily in the 13th century, there is architectural evidence of its use in Austria at that time, almost certainly relating to a personal emblem of Frederick, and almost certainly stemming from his Sicilian connection.Wilson (2000) pp. 37-38. Four years after Frederick's death the pope invested the Sicilian kingship in Edmund Crouchback (died 1296), the second surviving son of Henry III, King of England (died 1272),Ridgeway (2010); Lloyd (2008); Wilson (2000) p. 37. and for about ten years afterwards Edmund was styled \\"King of Sicily\\". Henry invested considerable political capital in his son's new position, and in his efforts to raise funds from taxation to support the dignity of that kingship made himself extremely unpopular with his English nobles, who eventually rebelled. The wife of Alexander III, King of Scotland, was Margaret of England (died 1275), a daughter of King Henry III.Reid (2011) This familial connection between the English and Scottish royal families might account for the introduction of the triskeles as a symbol of the Isle of Man. If so, it may well have been adopted as a means to reinforce the regime change on the island.Wilson (2000) pp. 36-37; Newton (1885).

As of the 2010 Census, its population was 8,650. It was previously known as Spassk (until 1926), Spassk-Tatarsky (until 1935), Kuybyshev (until 1991). History View to the Bolgar Historical and Archaeological Complex before the implementation of the complex programme The excavated monuments of Bolghar, the medieval capital of Volga Bulgaria, are within easy reach from the town. The modern town of Spassk () was formed from the village of Spassk (Chertykovo) on the bank of Bezdna River in 1781. It was renamed Spassk- Tatarsky () in 1926, then Kuybyshev ), in honor of Valerian Kuybyshev, in 1935, before getting its present name in 1991. It served as a district administrative center since 1930.Inhabited Localities of the Republic of Tatarstan, p. 246 In 1957, due to the construction of Kuybyshev Reservoir and flooding of the original Spassk, the town was moved from the place of its foundation closer to historical Bolgar. In 1991, the town changed its name to Bolgar in honor of the remains of the medieval city of Bolghar (Bolgar Historical and Archaeological Complex) located nearby. Since 2010, on the initiative and the supervision of the first president of the Republic of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaimiev, the complex programme 'Cultural Heritage - Island-Town of Sviyazhsk and Ancient Bolgar' has been implemented in Bolgar. The programme involves the conservation of architectural and archaeological heritage of Bolgar and the development of its touristic infrastructure. The programme has the following results: * Ket architectural monuments as Small Minaret, Cathedral Mosque, Khan's Shrine, Eastern Mausoleum, Northern Mausoleum, Eastern Chamber, Assumption Church were conserved; * Key archaeological ruins as Khan's Palace, Bath No2, Pottery Kilns were conserved; * Tourism and research infrastructure, including a River Station with the Museum of Bulgarian Civilization, Memorial Sign in honor of the adoption of Islam in the Volga Bulgaria, White Mosque, Healer's House and Crafts Workshops, International Centre for Archaeological Research, International Archaeological School, Museum of Bread, were constructed; * New museum expositions, including an Open-Air Museum on Turkic-Tatar Writing and Medieval Crafts of the City of Bolgar Ground were created; * Several houses on Nazarovykh and Mukhamedyara Streets were conserved, which are currently re- used as a cafe and museums; * Volga Riverside from the River station to the Saint Abraham's Well was improved and enhanced with interactive education facilities on Bolgar heritage. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Bolgar serves as the administrative center of Spassky District, to which it is directly subordinated.Order #01-02/9 As a municipal division, the town of Bolgar, together with the selo of Bolgary, is incorporated within Spassky Municipal District as Bolgar Urban Settlement.Law #40-ZRT Economy As of 1997, the town's industrial enterprises included a meat factory, a bakery, a brewery, a clothing factory, and a forestry farm. The nearest railway station is Cherdakly on the Ulyanovsk–Ufa line, south of Bolgar. Since 2010, the tourism flow to Bolgar has increased about 20 times: in 2010 Bolgar was visited by 50 000 tourists, in 2018 the annual visitation number has reached 541 000. In 2016, Bolgar became the most popular touristic towns of Russia. Demographics As of 1989, the population was ethnically mostly Russian (83.4%), Tatar (12.9%), and Chuvash (2.1%). As of 2018, the town is on the 989 place from 1113 cities and towns of the Russian Federation in terms of the number of its inhabitants.  Attractions  The town is bordering the Bolgar Historical and Archaeological Complex World Heritage site. The property was inscribed to the World Heritage List in 2014 in accordance with criteria (ii) and (vi). Its architectural and archaeological heritage is considered evidence of the medieval city of Bolgar, which existed in the 7-15th centuries as a key political centre of the Volga Bulgaria and the first capital of the Golden Horde.

Dean Bridge, known before 1999 as the Great River Bridge, is a planned cable-stayed bridge to carry Interstate 69 and U.S. Route 278 across the Mississippi River between Arkansas City, Arkansas and Benoit, Mississippi. The Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department began land acquisition for the project in October 2006, but no funding has been provided for construction. Preliminary studies indicate the bridge would be 4.25 miles (6.85 km) long, with one 1500-foot (460 m) cable-stayed span over the main channel of the river supported by two 450-foot (137 m) towers. A cost of $565 million has been estimated. The structure's name commemorates Charles W. Dean (1927–1998), an engineer from Cleveland, Mississippi who proposed the bridge in 1984. A Mississippi legislative act named the proposed bridge after Dean in 1999. History and development The Great River Bridge was originally proposed by Mississippi engineer Charles W. Dean in 1984. Originally part of the planned relocation of US-278 through the lower Mississippi Delta, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approved the environmental impact statement (EIS) and issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for the bridge in 2004. It has been determined that the Charles W. Dean Bridge will also carry Interstate 69, following FHWA approvals for sections of I-69 in Arkansas in 2006 and Mississippi in 2010 that will connect to either end of the bridge. Project status The Charles W. Dean Bridge project has cleared all of its environmental and permitting reviews, and is considered \\"shovel ready,\\" pending the availability of funds for construction. As of 2009, the bridge has been approved by Congress for funding, but has not actually been funded yet. The state of Arkansas began to purchase land for the bridge starting in October, 2006. In its 2011-2013 Statewide Transportation Improvement Plan, the AHTD intends to begin construction of the Arkansas approach roadways and structures in 2011, subject to funding. Construction of the bridge and the remaining connections is contingent upon funding. In 2017, the status of the bridge was brought to Congress's attention, and plans are in the works to make the bridge an active project.

Geography  The small rocky headland Kirra Point separates Kirra Beach to the north and Coolangatta Beach to the south, and is noted as one of the world's premier surf breaks. In the past the surf break was known for producing high quality barrels. Today sand pumping across the Tweed River mouth has filled it in and changed its character.  History  The name of the neighbourhood comes from Kirra Hill () which is above sea level, which first appears on an 1883 survey plan by surveyor Mr Schneider. Although believed to be an Indigenous name, the specific language and meaning is unknown. For example, in the Yuggera language, kaiyar means white cockatoo while in the Kabi language kirran means fire. Prior to 1840 Kirra is not known by its current name and is rarely visited by white settlers. From 1840 to 1910 the first white holiday-makers start to visit. From 1910 to 1920 holiday-makers increase, making Kirra a popular recreational beach area. In April 1914, on what is now known as Kirra, 18 residential and business sites were advertised to be auctioned by Fred Nash at the Tweed Heads Hall. A map advertising the auction states the sites at Coolangatta faced the Esplanade, now Musgrave Street located near a probable site for a railway siding. In the 1930s the opening of the South Coast Road increases the popularity of the southern Gold Coast as a holiday destination. Camping was very popular for families because Kirra had a long beach and a low-lying dune system. 1938 land sale at Kirra Beach, 1938 In 1938 the Queensland Government sells reclaimed swamp land at Kirra. From 1960- to early 1974 the Tweed River breakwaters combine with a series of low-pressure weather systems to result in serious sand erosion. This brings the high-water level to just below the coastal road. In May 1972 the Government of Queensland built a groyne, now called \\"big groyne\\", extending Kirra Point, to trap sand on Coolangatta beach to the south. The growing tourist industry there relied on sandy beaches and the Coolangatta stretch had been plagued by erosion problems. Surfers were against the plan, believing it would kill the break, and they held protest meetings. They were right about its effect on the surf, for the following year a deep hole formed off the groyne. But after that first year the sand returned and it broke as well as ever.Sean Doherty, MP: The Life of Michael Peterson, Harper Collins, 2004, . A second smaller barrier, called \\"little groyne\\" was later built a short distance north on Kirra beach. In 1995 30 metres was taken off Big Groyne to help fight erosion at Greenmount Beach. Both groynes have been almost completely covered by sand from the sand pumping. In 2001 the Tweed River sand bypass project commenced By 2003 Little Groyne was completely buried in sand. In 2006 Griffith University Coastal Management Center launch a project to restore the beach.  Environment  There have been environmental effects of the sand pumping on the reef. A popular diving area with sea-life including manta rays and wobbegongs has been buried over since the pumping started. Dive companies have relocated or turned their focus to other smaller reef areas. The sand pumping contract held on the area is in place until 2024, when the contract will be re-evaluated.

History The City's founding date is disputed with historical assertions ranging from 1540 to 1627. Some academics purport the city was built upon the orders Russia's first Tsar Ivan the Terrible who reigned from 1547 to 1584. A military fort was built adjacent to the city in 1638 by Ukrainian Cossacks of Yakiv Ostryanyn (see Ostryanyn uprising) on the order of Muscovite Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich. This military presence near Chuhuiv has continued throughout history. In 1819 there was a revolt of military settlers (Chuguev uprising).

He was the eighth king of the Zand dynasty. His brief reign is indicative of the ruthless and brutal struggle for power that prevailed among members of the Zand family following the death of Karim Khan Zand in 1779. King Ali-Morad Khan Zand (centre), at his court beside an unnamed Princess (left) and his son: Prince Sayed Morad Khan (right) Life Sayed Murad Khan was a member of the court of his predecessor, Jafar Khan, in the Zand capital of Shiraz. It was apparently Jafar Khan's treatment of Sayed Murad Khan that led the latter to plot the king's overthrow. Sayed Murad Khan had been governor of Shiraz but was later confined with his family and, according to one account beaten on Jafar Khan's orders in an effort to force him to divulge his wealth.Malcolm, John, The History of Persia, Vol. II, Part 1,1829 footnote, p. 106. In 1789 a group of individuals, led by Sayed Murad Khan conspired to poison Jafar Khan. A female slave was employed to carry out their wishes. Sayed Murad Khan and his followers overcame the weakened shah, killing him and throwing his head from the citadel. After the murder of Jafar Khan, Sayed Murad became the king of Iran. Jafar Khan's son, Lotf Ali Khan, then marched to Shiraz, where he was popular among the people. Sayed Murad Khan held out for a short while in the city's citadel, but after reigning for less than 4 months he was forced to surrender and was executed. Lotf Ali Khan succeeded him on May 10, 1789.

Lewis Downing (1823 - November 9, 1872), also known by his Cherokee name ᎷᏫ ᏌᏩᎾᏍᎩ (\\"Lewie-za-wau-na-skie\\") served as Chief of the Cherokee Nation from 1867 to 1872. After the death of John Ross, he was a compromise candidate who was elected to a full term as Principal Chief. Downing worked to heal divisions in the tribe following removal to the Indian Territory and the American Civil War. He was elected to a second term in 1871, but died in 1872, after a two-week battle with pneumonia. The Cherokee Council chose William P. Ross as his successor. Background Downing was born in eastern Tennessee in 1823 to Samuel Downing and his wife Susan Daugherty, who were both Cherokee with mixed European ancestry, as were many among the leaders of the Nation in those years. The young Downing attended school at the Valley Town Mission in North Carolina. When he was a young man, Downing and his family went west during the forced removal of the Cherokee and their slaves, now known as the Trail of Tears. The family was part of the emigration group led by Jesse Bushyhead.Conley, RobertJ. \\"Downing, Lewis\\" In: A Cherokee Encyclopedia. 2007. Available on Google Books, p. 84. Retrieved January 4, 2014. In 1839, the Downings arrived in what is now Adair County, Oklahoma. They settled near the site where Reverend Evan Jones had reorganized the Baptist Mission after its removal from North Carolina. Lewis Downing continued his education at Baptist Mission. Career Early in life, Downing became a convert of the Mission through the efforts of Reverend Jones. Downing subsequently was ordained as a Baptist minister. The historian John Bartlett Meserve wrote, \\"Reports of his [Downing's] spiritual activities reach back to 1842 when he was but nineteen years of age. On August 3, 1844, he was unanimously chosen pastor of the Flint Baptist Church, succeeding the Reverend Jesse Bushyhead who had died shortly before.\\"Meserve, John Bartlett.\\"Chief William Potter Ross.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 15, No. 1, March 1937. Retrieved July 15, 2013. The young minister was a strong participant in Cherokee Nation politics and as such was elected senator from Goingsnake District on August 4, 1845. He later removed to a farm on what is today the southeast corner of Mayes County, Oklahoma, where he was elected to the senate on August 4, 1851, and again on August 1, 1859. In 1851, Downing served as a delegate from the Cherokee tribe to Washington, D.C. Meserve, John Bartlett. \\"Chief Lewis Downing and Chief Charles Thompson (Oochalata),\\" The Chronicles of Oklahoma. 16 (September 1938) Retrieved July 15, 2013. Civil War The American Civil War exacerbated divisions within the tribe dating to removal and the years of violence following that. Chief Ross agreed to an alliance with the Confederacy and the Cherokee formed the majority of the Indian cavalry. Lewis Downing was named chaplain of companies F and S of the 1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles, which was formed by Chief Ross for the Confederate Army on October 4, 1861. Col. John Drew was the commanding officer. The members of this regiment were mostly full bloods and were not slave owners. The regiment fought in the Confederate service at Pea Ridge, Arkansas, on March 7–8, 1862. With the advance of the Union forces into the Territory in July 1862, and the departure of Chief Ross for Philadelphia under growing tribal tensions, the cavalry's members began to waver in their allegiance to the South. With few exceptions, among them Col. John Drew, the Cherokee began to abandon Confederate service. On July 11, 1862, at Flat Rock Creek, most joined the 3rd Regiment of the Indian Home Guards for service in the Union Army. This contingent was composed of three regiments consisting of 1,480 men, of which Lewis Downing was named Lieut. Colonel and the Rev. John B. Jones was designated its chaplain, in the brigade of Col. William A. Phillips. At the time, the majority of the Cherokee favored the Confederacy. They and those who were pro-Union formed dual governments in the Cherokee Nation, each striving to control its political affairs. The pro-Union forces, who recognized John Ross as chief, held meetings at Cowskin Prairie. In July 1862, they renounced allegiance to the Confederacy. Tom Pegg took over as acting chief, and their National Council in early 1863 reflected the Emancipation Proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln. On February 21, 1863, laws of were enacted and future slavery abolished. Lewis Downing assisted in leadership, serving as the third (in succession) acting principal chief of the Union Cherokee in John Ross' absence in Washington, D.C.. The dual governments continued until after the conclusion of the war. The pro-Confederate Cherokee were led by Stand Watie, who served as a brigadier general in the Confederate Army. Post war Lewis Downing, as president of the pro-Union tribal council, went to Washington in 1863 to alert the government to the divided situation of the Cherokee. After the war, a preliminary intertribal peace conference with the United States commissioners was held at Fort Smith on September 8, 1865. It was at this meeting that Downing protested against the refusal of the commissioners to accord recognition to John Ross as the Principal Chief of the Cherokee. At that time, Stand Watie was chief of the pro-Confederate Cherokee, and he proposed federal recognition of two Cherokee nations. The US dealt only with Ross and the pro-Union faction. Chief Ross returned to Tahlequah for a brief period in the fall of 1865. He returned to Washington the next year to protest against the approval of section nine of the treaty of June 19, 1866. The US government was requiring the Cherokee to free their slaves, and to grant them full citizenship in the Cherokee nation and equal rights to annuities and land grants as full-blood Cherokee. The Reverend John B. Jones approved this disputed section; he had accompanied Ross as a delegate and signed the treaty as such. Becoming chief John Ross died at Washington on August 1, 1866. As Assistant Principal Chief, Lewis Downing succeeded him and served until an election on October 19, 1866. The National Council chose William P. Ross to fill the position of Principal Chief until the next election. Much bitterness lingered among the Cherokee following the end of the war. Many resented the conditions which the US government had included in the peace treaty, as the pro-Confederate Cherokee had wanted the government to remove the freedmen at its expense and to allocate them land separately from the Cherokee. Among the Ross faction of the pro-Union Cherokee were many who insisted upon the exclusion of the pro-Confederate Cherokee from tribal affairs. There were sentiments that the penalties for their Southern activities had not been entirely exhausted. Downing opposed discrimination within the tribe. He formed the Downing Party to work for reunification of the different factions. Reverend John B. Jones threw his power and influence among the full bloods, behind the Downing movement which was to rehabilitate the Southern Cherokees and align them with the Union Cherokee.McLaughlin, pp. 245-6 In the tribal election held on August 5, 1867, Lewis Downing was elected Principal Chief with the support of both factions. The Downing party controlled the political affairs of the Cherokee Nation until Statehood in 1908, except for the tenure of chief Dennis W. Bushyhead from 1879 to 1887. Lewis Downing signed the Treaty of April 27, 1869, at Washington. He represented the Cherokee at Washington as a delegate in 1869 and in 1870. He was re-elected on August 7, 1871. Family Little information has been written about Lewis Downing's family life. Meserve says that he first married Lydia Price. He and Lydia had three children: Samuel Houston, John Toyuneet, and Catherine Downing.\\"Chief Lewis Downing.\\" Retrieved January 4, 2014. After Lydia's death, he married Lucinda Griffin. They had two children: Lewis James and William Downing. His third marriage was to Mary Eyre, a white widow whom he had met while he was in Washington. Mary moved to Talequah while Lewis' previous wife was still alive and married the old chief after her death. Both Lewis and Mary died about two years later. They had no children. Death He died in office at Tahlequah, on November 9, 1872, after a two-week battle with pneumonia, and is buried in the old Ned Adair cemetery in what is today Mayes County, Oklahoma. The Council was required to pick a successor to complete Downing's term. For unknown reasons, they turned to his old opponent, William Potter Ross.McLoughlin. p. 288 Sources McLoughlin, William G.

The site was first occupied in the 2004/05 austral summer, and has been designated since 2004 as the summer post office Tangra 1091, the southernmost branch of the Bulgarian Posts Plc. Access and survey routes Camp Academia is strategically situated in upper Huron Glacier, Wörner Gap area, at elevation 541 m in the northwestern foothills of Zograf Peak, central Tangra Mountains. The site is accessible by 11-12.5 km routes from the Bulgarian base St. Kliment Ohridski and the Spanish base Juan Carlos I respectively. Camp Academia offers convenient overland access to the main range of Tangra Mountains to the south (with survey and climbing routes leading from Camp Academia to Lyaskovets Peak and Mount Friesland via Catalunyan Saddle, and to Levski Peak, Great Needle Peak and Helmet Peak areas via Lozen Saddle); to Bowles Ridge, Vidin Heights, Kaliakra Glacier and Saedinenie Snowfield areas to the north; to Huron Glacier to the east; and to Pliska Ridge, Burdick Ridge, Perunika Glacier and Huntress Glacier to the west. Tangra 2004/05 Survey Camp Academia hosted the base camp of the Bulgarian topographic survey Tangra 2004/05 from 3 December 2004 until 2 January 2005. The survey was both shipborne from the ships Vanguardia and Akademik Vavilov, and onshore at Livingston Island and Half Moon Island, and was carried out from 25 November 2004 until 11 January 2005 by the two-member team of Lyubomir Ivanov and Doychin Vasilev who covered either on ski or on foot an overall distance of some 200 km, mostly in harsh weather conditions and challenging unfamiliar terrain in Tangra Mountains, Bowles Ridge, Vidin Heights and the glaciers Huron, Kaliakra and Perunika. First ascents were made of the peaks of Lyaskovets (1473 m), Ongal (1149 m), Zograf (1011 m), Komini (774 m), Melnik (696 m), Miziya (604 m), and several lesser peaks, as well as the third ascent of the summit Mount Friesland (1700 m). Extensive geodetic and geographic information was gathered, including coordinates and elevation data, actual sea shoreline and ice-free zones configuration, as well as a detailed photographic documentation of previously unexplored and remote areas in the interior of Livingston Island and Greenwich Island. Based on the survey, some 150 geographical features were mapped for the first time and a new 1:100000 topographic map of the two islands was published in 2005. Data from the topographic survey Tangra 2004/05 was used also in the 2008 Bulgarian map of Livingston, Greenwich, Robert, Snow, and Smith Islands. Field work carried out from Camp Academia during the Tangra 2004/05 survey has been noted by Discovery Channel, the Natural History Museum, the Royal Collection and the British Antarctic Survey as a timeline event in Antarctic exploration.Discovering Antarctica Overview.

One definition of virulence is the host's parasite-induced loss of fitness. The parasite's fitness is determined by its success in transmitting offspring to other hosts. At one time, the consensus was that over time, virulence moderated and parasitic relationships evolved toward symbiosis. This view has been challenged. A pathogen that is too restrained will lose out in competition to a more aggressive strain that diverts more host resources to its own reproduction. However, the host, being the parasite's resource and habitat in a way, suffers from this higher virulence. This might induce faster host death, and act against the parasite's fitness by reducing probability to encounter another host (killing the host too fast to allow for transmission). Thus, there is a natural force providing pressure on the parasite to \\"self- limit\\" virulence. The idea is, then, that there exists an equilibrium point of virulence, where parasite's fitness is highest. Any movement on the virulence axis, towards higher or lower virulence, will result in lower fitness for the parasite, and thus will be selected against. Mode of transmission According to evolutionary medicine, virulence increases with horizontal transmission (between non-relatives) and decreases with vertical transmission (from parent to child). Paul W. Ewald has explored the relationship between virulence and mode of transmission. He came to the conclusion that virulence tends to remain especially high in waterborne and vector-borne infections, such as cholera and Dengue. Cholera is spread through sewage and Dengue through mosquitos. In the case of respiratory infections, the pathogen depends on an ambulatory host to survive. It must spare the host long enough to find a new host. Water- or vector-borne transmission circumvents the need for a mobile host. Ewald is convinced that the crowding of trench warfare provided an easy route to transmission that explains the virulence of the 1918 influenza pandemic. In crowded conditions the time to find a new host is minimal. Other epidemiologists have expanded on the idea of a tradeoff between costs and benefits of virulence. One factor is the time or distance between potential hosts. Airplane travel, crowded factory farms and urbanization have all been suggested as possible sources of virulence. Another factor is the presence of multiple infections in a single host leading to increased competition among pathogens. In this scenario, the host can survive only as long as it resists the most virulent strains. The advantage of a low virulence strategy becomes moot. Multiple infections can also result in gene swapping among pathogens, increasing the likelihood of lethal combinations. Evolutionary hypotheses There are three main hypotheses about why a pathogen evolves as it does. These three models help to explain the life history strategies of parasites, including reproduction, migration within the host, virulence, etc. The three hypotheses are the Trade-Off Hypothesis, the Short-Sighted Evolution Hypothesis, and the Coincidental Evolution Hypothesis. All of these offer ultimate explanations for virulence in pathogens. =Trade- off hypothesis= At one time, some biologists argued that pathogens would tend to evolve toward ever decreasing virulence because the death of the host (or even serious disability) is ultimately harmful to the pathogen living inside. For example, if the host dies, the pathogen population inside may die out entirely. Therefore, it was believed that less virulent pathogens that allowed the host to move around and interact with other hosts should have greater success reproducing and dispersing. But this is not necessarily the case. Pathogen strains that kill the host can increase in frequency as long as the pathogen can transmit itself to a new host, whether before or after the host dies. The evolution of virulence in pathogens is a balance between the costs and benefits of virulence to the pathogen. For example, Mackinnon and Read (2004) and Paul et al. (2004) studied the malaria parasite using a rodent and chicken model respectively and found that there was trade-off between transmission success and virulence as defined by host mortality. =Short-sighted evolution hypothesis= Short-sighted evolution suggests that the traits that increase reproduction rate and transmission to a new host will rise to high frequency within the pathogen population. These traits include the ability to reproduce sooner, reproduce faster, reproduce in higher numbers, live longer, survive against antibodies, or survive in parts of the body the pathogen does not normally infiltrate. These traits typically arise due to mutations, which occur more frequently in pathogen populations than in host populations, due to the pathogens' rapid generation time and immense numbers. After only a few generations, the mutations that enhance rapid reproduction or dispersal will increase in frequency. The same mutations that enhance the reproduction and dispersal of the pathogen also enhance its virulence in the host, causing much harm (disease and death). If the pathogen's virulence kills the host and interferes with its own transmission to a new host, virulence will be selected against. But as long as transmission continues despite the virulence, virulent pathogens will have the advantage. So, for example, virulence often increases within families, where transmission from one host to the next is likely, no matter how sick the host. Similarly, in crowded conditions such as refugee camps, virulence tends to increase over time since new hosts cannot escape the likelihood of infection. =Coincidental evolution hypothesis= Some forms of pathogenic virulence did not co-evolve with the host. For example, tetanus is caused by the soil bacterium Clostridium tetani. After C. tetani bacteria enter a human wound, the bacteria may grow and divide rapidly, even though the human body is not their normal habitat. While dividing, C. tetani produce a neurotoxin that is lethal to humans. But it is selection in the bacterium's normal life cycle in the soil that leads it to produce this toxin, not any evolution with a human host. The bacterium finds itself inside a human instead of in the soil by mere happenstance. We can say that the neurotoxin is not directed at the human host. More generally, the virulence of many pathogens in humans may not be a target of selection itself, but rather an accidental by-product of selection that operates on other traits, as is the case with antagonistic pleiotropy. Expansion into new environments A potential for virulence exists whenever a pathogen invades a new environment, host or tissue. The new host is likely to be poorly adapted to the intruder, either because it has not built up an immunological defense or because of a fortuitous vulnerability. In times of change, natural selection favors mutations that exploit the new host more effectively than the founder strain, providing an opportunity for virulence to erupt. Host susceptibility Host susceptibility contributes to virulence. Once transmission occurs, the pathogen must establish an infection to continue. The more competent the host immune system, the less chance there is for the parasite to survive. It may require multiple transmission events to find a suitably vulnerable host. During this time, the invader is dependent upon the survival of its current host. The optimum conditions for high virulence would be a community with immune dysfunction (and/or poor hygiene and sanitation) that was in all other ways as healthy as possible (eg optimum nutrition).

His books include \\"Becoming Wild; How Animal Cultures Raise Families, Create Beauty, and Achieve Peace;\\" Beyond Words; What Animals Think and Feel; Song for the Blue Ocean; Eye of the Albatross; The View From Lazy Point; A Natural Year in an Unnatural World, and others. He is the founding president of the Safina Center, and is inaugural holder of the Carl Safina Endowed Chair for Nature and Humanity at Stony Brook University. Safina hosted the PBS series Saving the Ocean with Carl Safina.  Early life  Carl Safina was born in Brooklyn, New York to Italian Americans (his grandparents were from Sicily.) At age ten he moved with his family into the new and rapidly expanding suburbs of Long Island, New York. As a teen Safina spent free hours fishing, camping, and hiking near his home. Rapid building and construction on Long Island caused him to witness destruction of woodlands and other natural habitats, which made another deep and personal impression. Eventually he chose to major in environmental science at the State University of New York at Purchase. Later at Rutgers University he earned master's and PhD degrees in ecology for his studies of seabirds. Career Carl Safina works to show that nature and human dignity require each other. His recent works probe the ways in which our relationship with the natural world affects human relations, and how the scientific facts imply the need for moral and ethical responses. His most recent books explore cognitive and emotional capacities of the minds of other animals, as well as individuality and cultural learning in free-living animals. His early research focused on seabird ecology. In the 1990s he drew attention to environmental issues in fisheries. He led campaigns to ban high-seas driftnets, to re-write U.S. federal fisheries law, to work toward international conservation of tunas, sharks, and other fishes, and to achieve passage of a United Nations global fisheries treaty. His more recent writings are about ecology, conservation, and humanity broadly. He has written about a wide array of issues and creatures of ocean and land, including tunas, salmon, sharks, sea turtles, seabirds, albatrosses, elephants, wolves, orca whales, sperm whales, dolphins, chimpanzees, macaws, forests, coral reefs, and sustainable food. His first book, Song for the Blue Ocean, was chosen as a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, a Los Angeles Times best nonfiction selection, a Library Journal best science book selection, and won the Lannan Literary Award for nonfiction. His second book, Eye of the Albatross, won the John Burroughs Medal and the National Academies' communications award for the year's best book. Safina’s Voyage of the Turtle was an N.Y. Times Editors’ Choice. In 2011, The View From Lazy Point was a New York Times Editors' Choice, a National Geographic Traveler's book of the month and received the Orion Book Award. Also in 2011, his chronicle of the Gulf blowout, A Sea in Flames, was a New York Times Editors' Choice. He also authored Beyond Words; What Animals Think and Feel, and in 2010 published a children's book, Nina Delmar: The Great Whale Rescue. His work has been featured in National Geographic and in The New York Times and other publications. He contributed a new foreword to Rachel Carson's seminal work, The Sea Around Us. Safina is inaugural holder of the Endowed Chair for Nature and Humanity at Stony Brook University and president of The Safina Center. He has a Ph.D. in ecology from Rutgers University and has been awarded honorary doctorates from the State University of New York, Long Island University and Drexel University. He has been a visiting fellow at Yale University and a senior fellow with the World Wildlife Fund. Safina is also a MacArthur Fellow, a Guggenheim Fellow, a Pew Fellow in Marine conservation, an Utne Reader visionary, and a recipient of Chicago's Brookfield Zoo's Rabb Medal.

Memphians refer to this bridge as the \\"Old Bridge\\" to distinguish it from the \\"New Bridge\\", or Hernando de Soto Bridge, upstream. The Memphis & Arkansas Bridge also carries U.S. Route 61 (US 61), US 64, US 70 and US 79 from Memphis to West Memphis; it also carried US 63 prior to its truncation (and later rerouting) in Arkansas. The western terminus of Tennessee State Route 1 (SR 1) sits on the Tennessee–Arkansas boundary halfway across the bridge. The bridge consists of five Warren through trusses, each with a length of . Combined with the approach segments, the bridge's total length is . Completed in 1949, it is the only bridge spanning the Mississippi River designed to carry exclusively vehicular traffic that was built before 1950. It was designed by Modjeski and Masters, successors to the firm that designed the Harahan Bridge, built in 1916 to carry vehicular and rail traffic. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Built before the introduction of the Interstate Highway System, the span was not built to Interstate Highway standards; it lacks the concrete barrier between the different directions of traffic which was added later. It was also built with a sidewalk on either side of the roadway, positioned just outside the steel truss girders. The sidewalks, now also separated from the traffic lanes by concrete barriers, are accessible from Memphis city sidewalks on the Tennessee side, but give way to grassy slopes on the shoulders of I-55 on the Arkansas side. The sidewalk and bridge is listed as part of the Mississippi River Trail. However, travel is not recommended across the sidewalk and is prohibited on the vehicle traffic lanes of the bridge, as the structure is an Interstate Highway crossing. On August 12, 2012, a cyclist was killed after being struck by a vehicle when using the shoulder approaching the bridge. In 2016, a pedestrian/bicycle path on the neighboring Harahan Bridge made crossing the river safer and eliminated the need to use the I-55 bridge. On December 23, 2014, numerous news sources reported that the FBI had released an official statement warning local law enforcements of a threat to the bridge during that month. The FBI stated, \\"according to an anonymous complainant... ISIS instructed an ISIS member, a presumed USPER (U.S. person) in Memphis, with a direct order to blow up the Memphis–Arkansas bridge on an unknown date, activating ISIS terror cells in the United States.\\" Security was heightened, but the threat was later discredited.

A collection of speeches, live music, and occasional civil disobedience are centered on the goal of reforming federal, state, and local marijuana laws. The first Hash Bash was held on Saturday, April 1, 1972 in response to the March 9th 1972 decision by Michigan Supreme Court declaring unconstitutional the law used to convict cultural activist John Sinclair for possession of two marijuana joints. This action left the State of Michigan without a law prohibiting the use of marijuana until after the weekend of April 1, 1972.Allison Pincus, \\"The First 'High Noon' March,\\" Michigan Daily, 3 Apr. 2007. Chef Ra was a fixture of the Hash Bash for 19 consecutive years before his death in late 2006. Before cannabis legalization in Michigan, the penalty for cannabis law violations in the City of Ann Arbor was a $30 fine and $25 court costs for a total of $55, and was a civil infraction ticket. The campus falls under state, not city jurisdiction but \\"for decades, police had in the past exercised discretion and a general tolerance for public marijuana use at the annual Hash Bash. Marijuana is openly consumed annually on the campus and at past events, few, if any, arrests occur.

The 2010 Hash Bash on April 3 had an estimated 5,000 attendees. The 2015 Hash Bash had a record 8,000–15,000 attendees largely owing to the appearance of comedian Tommy Chong and was 2 hours long instead of the usual hour. In 2019, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer recorded a video for Hash Bash attendees that celebrated the state's legalization of recreational cannabis.

The first chief conductor was Hermann Hildebrandt. In 1974, the Berlin Sinfonietta was founded to serve as the sister chamber orchestra of the Berliner Sinfonie-Orchester. After German reunification in 1989, the orchestra was threatened with dissolution, but subscriber action maintained the ensemble. The orchestra acquired its current name in 2006. (This orchestra is separate from the West-Berlin based Berliner Symphoniker, founded in 1967.) The Konzerthausorchester Berlin currently has, as its sister chamber orchestra, the Konzerthaus Kammerorchester. Kurt Sanderling was the longest-serving chief conductor of the orchestra, from 1960 to 1977. Subsequent chief conductors have been Günther Herbig, Claus Peter Flor, Michael Schønwandt (1992–1998), Eliahu Inbal (2001–2006), and Lothar Zagrosek. In February 2011, the orchestra announced the appointment of Iván Fischer as its eighth principal conductor, effective with the 2012-2013 season, with an initial contract of 3 years. In October 2016, the orchestra announced that Fischer is to stand down as its principal conductor after the 2017-2018 season. In November 2017, the orchestra announced the appointment of Christoph Eschenbach as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2019-2020 season, with an initial contract of 3 years. Principal guest conductors of the orchestra have included Dmitri Kitayenko, the current holder of the post. With the 2017-2018 season, Juraj Valčuha became principal guest conductor of the orchestra, following his initial guest-conducting appearance with the orchestra in the 2014-2015 season, and his subsequent return guest-conducting engagement 2 years later.

It is on the boundary of the West Midlands and Worcestershire counties between the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley and Kidderminster. As of December 2016 it had an estimated population of 6,097.City Population Development From the time of the Domesday Book until the 1933 boundary changes, the parish of Hagley extended southwards from the village to include the present parish of Blakedown. The main focus of the village on the lower slopes of the Clent Hills was on the outskirts of where Hagley Hall and the parish church of St John the Baptist can be found. The parish register of Hagley is the oldest in England. It dates from 1 December 1538, being the year in which registers were ordered to be kept in all parishes. Lower Hagley lies downhill and started to expand with the arrival of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway in 1852 and the eventual building of Hagley railway station. The growth of what is now known as West Hagley initiated a shift in the focus of the village. Today West Hagley contains the shopping area and the schools, although the precise dividing line between the two areas is not formally defined. Civil status View from Hagley Hall towards West Hagley Hagley is part of the West Midlands Urban Area as defined by the Office for National Statistics, and is joined to Stourbridge and the Black Country by the A491 and B4187. It is also situated on the A456 Birmingham to Kidderminster road. This is known as the Hagley Road in Birmingham, as it was once administered by a turnpike trustLocal Statute, 26 Geo. II, c.47 whose responsibilities ended at the former boundary of the parish (now in Blakedown). There is also a frequent rail service between Kidderminster and Birmingham. Although Hagley has a population larger than some market towns (such as Tenbury Wells) and once had its own cattle market, it lacks the characteristics of a market town.According to the definition in West Midlands Regional Spatial Strategy, policy RR3. While it has a shopping street and many local services, it has little local employment beyond these, although unemployment is low: 2.6 per cent of the population at the time of the 2001 census.Hagley census profile Hagley is essentially a dormitory village for Birmingham or the adjacent Black Country. Prior to the creation of the Parish Council by the Local Government Act 1894, village affairs were run by the ratepayers of a vestry committee based on St John the Baptist Church. Presently, Hagley falls within the boundary of Bromsgrove District Council, but it also has a Parish Council that is responsible for some local sites and services. On this sit the elected District Councillors for Hagley East and West and a number of co-opted members; it also employs a Parish Clerk and Assistant Parish Clerk.Council site History Evidence of previous habitation of the area is found in Bronze Age burial mounds in a field on Stakenbridge Lane which were excavated in the 18th century, and the later Iron Age hill fort on Wychbury Hill. A Roman salt road running from Droitwich crossed the Hagley parish to the west and there have been discoveries of Roman pottery and a coin hoard in the area. But the earliest written reference to the village is as Hageleia in the Domesday Book, when it formed part of the Clent Hundred, later to be amalgamated into the Halfshire Hundred. Pagett 1997, pp.7-18 De Hagley lords of the manor first appeared in 1130, a connection lasting until 1411.Pagett 1997, pp.19-26 Intermittent ownership followed until the 1590s, when members of the Lyttelton family took up residence, a connection that has lasted until the present day. Among these, Sir John Lyttleton was implicated in Essex's Rebellion and his brother Humphrey was hanged, drawn and quartered for sheltering men involved in the Gunpowder Plot on his Hagley estate, including his nephew Stephen. The most notable member of the family was the statesman and poet George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton, who landscaped the grounds at Hagley and replaced the old half-timbered hall with the present Palladian mansion. His brother Charles, eventually Bishop of Carlisle, was also born at Hagley and was buried there in the family church of St John the Baptist. Another of the family, William Henry, served as rector there from 1847 to 1884.Pagett 1997, pp.27-34 Churches The Domesday Book recorded that Hagley had a priest. The original wooden church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist was eventually rebuilt in stone under the De Hagley family, of which there are still traces. These include a mediaeval tomb, now incorporated into the north wall; a stone with an incised lion set into the back wall of the lady chapel; and two sandstone angels added to the 19th-century porch. From 1747 dates Louis-François Roubiliac’s memorial to Lucy Lyttleton; there is also an oval immersion font from this period which was discarded after the virtual rebuilding of the church in Gothic style by George Edmund Street in the second half of the nineteenth century. It was then too that a red sandstone tower and spire were added to the building.”Church of St John the Baptist”, British Listed Buildings While the church of St John the Baptist served the old village of Hagley, the development of West Hagley after the coming of the railway initiated the building of an overspill Mission church there in 1882, after which Church Street is named. In 1906 it was replaced by St Saviour’s Church on the corner of Park Road and Worcester Road. This consists of a towerless stone-built nave and chancel in what Nikolaus Pevsner describes as \\"uninspired\\" Perpendicular styleAlan Brooks, Nikolaus Pevsner, Worcestershire, Yale University 2007, p.340 and has a series of windows by Francis Skeat. There was also a nearby Primitive Methodist chapel, which gave Chapel Street its name. Built in 1857, it was replaced in 1905 by the Free Church now on Worcester Road, whose new building continues to play a central role in the community.The Street Names of Hagley and their Origins, Hagley Field and Historical Society 2000 This union (non-denominational) church was the second such in the country.Don Moss, “Hagley Free Church”, Hagley Field and Historical Society Rural industry The railway station at Hagley, an Edwardian postcard Two watercourses starting from the slopes of the Clent Hills run through the village. On one was Spout Mill, which ground corn near where the Worcester and Kidderminster roads diverge south of the village. The two brooks combined lower down to create Sweetpool (now encroached on by the railway line and silted up); beyond that was the 18th-century Brake Mill, where the stream was dammed to create the mill pool. Before the boundary changes of 1888, a number of ironworking mills established further downstream during the industrial revolution gave Hagley an industrial hinterland. pp.29-30 Apart from the abortive Wassell Grove colliery opened during 1866-7, there was little heavy industry in the area. There is early evidence of glass- making in the village but this was probably only a cottage industry.Pagett 1997, pp.55-7 The inhabitants were predominantly engaged in agriculture; thirteen farms are recorded in the 18th century, eighteen in the early 20th, although by the end of it only two remained.Pagett 1997, p.50 The soil is sandy and poor, so there was a greater emphasis on livestock than on arable farming.“Parishes: Hagley”, A History of the County of Worcester: Volume 3 (London, 1913) Hagley had a cattle market by 1600, located just south of the road junction between the Hagley road [to Stourbridge] (A491) and the Birmingham road (A456). This was extended in both the 18th and 19th centuries and was served by the railway until the market closed in the 1960s.

Oscar Grasso is at left on violin. Victor Marlborough Silvester OBE (25 February 1900The date of the relief of Mafeking, and the probable reason for his first name. (autobiog.)14 August 1978) was an English dancer, author, musician and bandleader from the British dance band era. He was a significant figure in the development of ballroom dance during the first half of the 20th century, and his records sold 75 million copies from the 1930s through to the 1980s.Scott, Derek B. 2004.

He was educated at Ardingly College, St. John's School, Leatherhead and John Lyon School, Harrow, from all of which he absconded. In September 1916 he enlisted in the British Army during the First World War and served as a private in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. He lied about his age to the recruiting authorities, stating this as 20 whereas he was only 16. He took part in the Battle of Arras in April/May 1917, and claimed to be a member of five execution squads, where deserters were shot.George Macintyre, \\"Doomed Youth: how the tragedy of 250,000 boy soldiers in the trenches was covered up\\", The Journal, Newcastle upon Tyne, 14 June 2004 Children of the Great War However, the release of his service records in 2000 revealed that he had been discharged from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in 1916 as underage after just a week of service. Re-enlisted in 1918 he served only at home until demobilisation and could not have participated in any executions.Corns, Cathryn & Hughes-Wilson, John 'Blindfold and Alone'. Cassell London 2001 Once his age was discovered, he was immediately withdrawn from the front and sent back to the military base at Étaples. After two weeks he was transferred to the First British Ambulance Unit For Italy. On 4 September 1917 at Sella di Dol near San Gabriele, while acting as a stretcher bearer to evacuate wounded Italian servicemen during a heavy bombardment by the Austrians and Germans, he was injured in the leg by a shell burst but refused medical treatment until the other wounded had been attended to. For his gallantry on this occasion he was awarded the Italian Bronze Medal of Military Valour in a decree by the Italian Minister of War dated 30 November 1917. In a letter to Silvester's parents dated 20 September 1917, his Commandant in the First British Ambulance Unit, the noted historian G. M. Trevelyan, wrote: \\"He is certainly one who will be deservedly loved wherever he goes in life, and he is besides made of sterling stuff.\\"Victor Silvester - 'Dancing Is My Life' (1958) plus original war service documents and G.M. Trevelyan correspondence in the Victor Silvester Archive. After the war he studied at Worcester College, Oxford for a year. He decided to resume a military career when he was offered a place at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, but he quickly decided it was not for him. He also studied music at Trinity College, London, having already had private piano lessons as a child.  Career in dance  His interests had meanwhile turned to dancing. He was one of the first post-war English dancers to feature the full natural turn in the slow waltz. This innovation was a factor in his winning the first World Ballroom Dancing Championship in 1922 with Phyllis Clarke as his partner. He married Dorothy Newton a few days later. He competed again in 1924, coming second to Maxwell Stewart – the inventor of the double reverse spin in the waltz – and Barbara Miles. He was a founding member of the Ballroom Committee of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing which codified the theory and practice of Ballroom Dance – now known as the International Style – and published the first book embodying the new standards in 1927. This was Modern Ballroom Dancing, which became a best- seller and has remained in print through many editions, the last issued in 2005. He went on to open a dancing academy in London, which eventually developed into a chain of 23 dance studios. By the early 1930s his teaching had become famous and he had taught some of the top celebrities of the day, among whom was Estelle Thompson, better known as Merle Oberon.Victor Silvester 1958. Dancing Is My Life: The Autobiography of Victor Silvester. Heinemann, London. Victor had his own BBC television show through the 1950s, called BBC Dancing Club, and was later the President of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing.  Career in music  The lack of what he felt were adequate records for dancing led Silvester in 1935 to form his own five-piece band, later enlarged and named Victor Silvester and his Ballroom Orchestra, whose first record, \\"You're Dancing on My Heart\\" (by Al Bryan and George M. Meyer), sold 17,000 copies and was to become his signature tune. He insisted his recordings conform precisely to the beats per minute recommended by the ISTD for ballroom dances, a concept termed \\"strict tempo\\". In British eyes he became indelibly associated with the catch-phrase \\"slow, slow, quick-quick- slow\\" – a rhythm that occurs in the foxtrot and quickstep. The Silvester band always had a distinctive sound, achieved by an unusual line-up including, as well as the usual rhythm section, alto saxophone (initially Charlie Spinelli and later, for 26 years, Edward Owen \\"Poggy\\" Pogson, who had previously played in Jack Payne's and Jack Hylton's bands), a lead solo violin (for many years usually Oscar Grasso), and not one but two pianos, one taking turn in solos and the other maintaining an improvised tinkling continuo in the background throughout every piece, which Silvester called his \\"lemonade\\". This piano sound is said to have been created for him by the pianist/ later bandleader and BBC radio star Felix King. He notes in his autobiography that his first two pianists in 1935 were Gerry Moore for the melody and Felix King for the \\"lemonade\\". Later pianists included, at different times, Monia Liter, Charlie Pude, Jack Phillips, Billy Munn, Victor Parker (also accordion), Ernest \\"Slim\\" Wilson (who was also Silvester's main arranger, and with whom he co-wrote several pieces), Eddie Macauley and Ronnie Taylor. Silvester's drummer for over four decades was Ben Edwards, crucial for supplying the strict tempo. Sometimes there might be four saxophones altogether, two alto and two tenor, including in latter years Tony Mozr, Percy Waterhouse and Phil Kirby in addition to Pogson, all doubling on clarinet as required. On some recordings, the Ballroom Orchestra was augmented with 15 strings and woodwind, when it became \\"The Silver Strings\\". During the war, when Oscar Grasso was in the forces, the classical violinist Alfredo Campoli took his place, using the name \\"Alfred Campbell\\" for contractual reasons. These were first-class players, some of whom (like Liter, Grasso and Pogson) were already noted in jazz or danceband circles before they joined Silvester's band. Unlike most British dance bands of the era, there were no vocals. Silvester usually did not play (he was a violinist), but stood in front of his orchestra in white tie and tails, conducting with a flourish. He would continue to make music for half a century, mostly covering the popular music standards and show tunes, sometimes (but rarely) swing, trad jazz and in latter years, especially from 1971 when the orchestra continued under his son Victor Silvester Jr, rock and roll, disco and pop. These later attempts to stay \\"with it\\" involved the introduction of an electric guitar, but it is mostly the more melodic recordings of the 1940s and 1950s that are now reissued on CD and still sold widely. = Competition = Silvester's record sales were so huge that competition was inevitable. Other dancers were attracted to the idea, and set up their own strict-tempo bands. Henry Jacques, Maxwell Stewart, Josephine Bradley and Wally Fryer were all top-flight dancers who set up in competition to Silvester. There were other bands led by musicians who were capable of recording in strict time. The best for ballroom competitions was probably Joe Loss, who had an even longer musical career than Silvester. Other bands that catered to ballroom dancing were Oscar Rabin and Jack Harris, whose band played in clubs and restaurants through the 1930s, Phil Tate, and Jack Parnell. For the post-war period of Latin dances to (mostly) Cuban and Brazilian rhythms, Edmundo Ros was in a class of his own.  Later life  By 1958, when he published his autobiography, he was the most successful dance band leader in British musical history, and a major star on British radio and television. His BBC Television show Dancing Club lasted 17 years. He also presented a weekly request programme on the BBC Overseas Service (later World Service) which ran from 1948 to 1975.\\"Victor Silvester's BBC Dancing Club\\", WW2 People's War, BBC website His obituary in The Times noted, \\"Turn on a radio in Famagusta, Cape Town or Peking and one would be likely to hear his music issuing from the speakers\\".\\"Mr Victor Silvester: doyen of ballroom dancing\\" (obituary), The Times, London, 15 August 1978, p. 14. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1957 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre. Victor Silvester was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1961. He died while on holiday in the south of France at the age of 78. The orchestra remained in existence under his son's direction until the 1990s. Victor, his wife and son are memorialised at Golders Green Crematorium, London. The Victor Silvester Archive - which includes his OBE and First World War medals and related original documents and correspondence, his many other accolades such as his four Carl Alan Awards for services to dancing and his BBC Radio Golden Microphone Award, the complete archive of programme sheets for his orchestra's BBC broadcasts, platinum and silver discs for his orchestra's record sales and the orchestra's entire archive of original hand-scored strict tempo sheet music - was sold at auction in London in March 2000 and is now held in a private collection in Northern England.

Produced by Peter Spirer, Casey Suchan and Denis Henry Hennelly and executive produced by Quincy Jones III (QD3), the film was written by Peter Alton and Spirer, and narrated by actor Ving Rhames. Content Beef takes a chronological look at battles (some friendly, but many personal) dating back to rap music's infancy in the early 1980s. The notable rivalries discussed include KRS-One vs. MC Shan, Kool Moe Dee vs. Busy Bee, 50 Cent vs. Murder Inc Records, Tru Life vs. Mobb Deep, Common vs. Ice Cube & Westside Connection, the break-up of legendary group N.W.A, which includes Ice Cube's abrupt departure, and the later animosity between Dr. Dre and Eazy-E, the highly publicized Jay-Z vs. Nas rivalry and the most infamous feud of all, 2Pac vs. The Notorious B.I.G.. It was partly born out of producer Jones's belief that \\"Beefs are killing hip-hop\\". Many prominent hip-hop personalities such as Russell Simmons, Snoop Dogg, Kool Moe Dee, Jay-Z, KRS- One, Mack 10, DMX and Ice-T also participate through interviews (some produced for the film, as well as archived interviews from other sources, such as MTV and BET clips). Beef also features newly released performances by many musical artists. The film also contains never-before-seen performances by many of the participants and many others, plus extended portions of interviews that did not make final cut. One portion of the extended interviews features part of an interview with Nate Dogg talking about an incident that occurred around 1995 at a Dogg Pound video shoot, in which entourage members representing Ruthless Records showed up and started a big brawl with members of then-rival Death Row Records. Although Dogg did not mention them by name (he however subtlety mentioned the duo's less-than-successful 1995 album Real Brothaz), rappers B.G. Knocc Out and Dresta (who participated in Eazy-E's hit diss recording, Real Muthaphuckkin G's) were among the alleged participants in the fight.

His mother was a paternal relative of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. His paternal grandmother was Porcia Catonis (sister to Cato the Younger). Biography As a young man Lucius was a renowned and devoted charioteer, perhaps to the point of obsession. He was betrothed in 36 BC, at the meeting of Octavian and Mark Antony at Tarentum, to Antonia Major, the daughter of the latter by Octavia. He was aedile in 22 BC and consul in 16 BC. After his consulship, he served as governor of Africa from 13/12 BC. He was later probably the successor of Tiberius in Germania, where he commanded the Roman army and crossed the Elbe, during which he set up an altar to Augustus, and penetrated further into the country than any of his predecessors had done.Tacitus, Annales 4.44 He also built a walkway, called the pontes longi, over the marshes between the Rhine River and the Ems River. In 15 AD the Battle at Pontes Longi was fought along this walkway. For these achievements he received the insignia of a triumph. He died in 25 AD. Suetonius described him as \\"arrogant, cruel, notorious and extravagant,\\"Suetonius, Nero 4 and records numerous instances of his disrespect, including to censor Lucius Munatius Plancus, to a proconsul of Africa, and to a legate of Illyricum. In his praetorship and consulship he brought Roman equites and married women on the stage to perform in pantomimes, which rankled because in Rome acting was considered to be low-class. He exhibited shows of wild beasts in every quarter of the city, and his gladiatorial combats were conducted with such excessive bloodshed that Augustus was obliged to put some restraint upon them.Cassius Dio, liv. 59Marcus Velleius Paterculus, ii. 72 He had three children with Antonia Major: Domitia Lepida the Elder, born c. 8 BC; Domitia Lepida the Younger, born c. 3 BC and mother of the Empress Valeria Messalina; and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (born 17 BC) the biological father of Emperor Nero.Gaius Stern, Women, Children, and Senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae Chapter 6 (Berk.

Founded over 150 years ago, the show displays and celebrates agriculture and livestock rearing, crafts and hobbies, local heritage and farming history. Competitions are held for animals, produce and handicrafts in a wide range of classes. Other attractions include trade stands, craft demonstrations and amusements. History The show began life as a ploughing match between local farmers organised by the Evercreech Farmers Club but by the 1870s this had metamorphosed into a cattle show, appropriate given the dairy farming in the region. Separate classes existed for horses, and for cheese and butter-making. The show championed agricultural improvement and the increased saleability of two local products, Cheddar cheese and cider. Despite breaks for two World Wars, the show thrived. After the centenary year in 1952 the show gradually lost importance as older trades died and farming and food production became more industrialised. A rekindling of interest in rural life and a backlash against intensive agriculture have been suggested to explain the recent recovery of the show's fortunes, despite the competition of larger regional shows such as the Bath and West show held only away. It seems more popular than previously in the local community. Since 2002 there has been no admission fee to the show although charges are made for competition entries.

The road then heads northwestward through an area of evergreen forest, exiting the town. After several switchbacks, the route heads westward into Big Basin Redwoods State Park, where its name is Big Basin Highway.

He changed to bass at 16, to fill in the void in a schoolmate's band. At age of 17, he went to the U.S. to study harmony and orchestration at the University of California. Back in Brazil he went to study at CLAM, with famous Brazilian bassists Luis Chaves and Amilton Godoy. Later, in 1976, he again left Brazil and headed to New York City, willing to study and perform with his instrument at a deeper level. There, he played with several important musicians of the jazz scene, including Wayne Shorter, Pat Metheny, Sadao Watanabe, Larry Coryell, Fred Hersh, Larry Willis, Joe Diorio, John Hicks, Steve Slagle, Victor Lewis, Don Salvador and Charlie Rouse. In the USA, he mastered various bass playing techniques, being one of the pioneers of fretless and 6-string bass in Brazil when he came back on 1981, the same year in which he released the first bassist solo album in the country, titled \\"Nico Assumpção\\".

Polyneuropathy indicates that multiple nerves are involved, unlike mononeuropathy. Polyneuropathy usually involves motor nerve dysfunction, also known as lower motor neuron disease. Symptoms include decreased or absent reflexes and muscle tone, weakness, or paralysis. It often occurs in the rear legs and is bilateral. Most are chronic problems with a slow onset of symptoms, but some occur suddenly. Most common types of polyneuropathy *Birman cat distal polyneuropathy is an inherited disorder caused by decreased numbers of myelinated axons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Astrogliosis (an increase in the number of astrocytes) is also noted. The lesions are most commonly found in the lateral pyramidal tract of the lumbar spinal cord, the fasciculi gracili of the dorsal column of the cervical spinal cord, and the cerebellar vermian white matter. Symptoms start at the age of 8 to 10 weeks, and include frequent falling and walking on the hock. The prognosis is poor. The disease is suspected to have a recessive mode of inheritance. *Botulism is very rare in dogs and usually follows feeding on carrion. Symptoms include weakness, difficulty eating, acute facial nerve paralysis, and megaesophagus. Compared to other species, dogs and cats are relatively resistant to botulism. *Dancing Doberman disease primarily affects the gastrocnemius muscle in Dobermans. It usually starts between the ages of 6 and 7 months. One rear leg will flex while standing. Over the next few months, it will begin to affect the other rear leg. Eventually, the dog is alternatively flexing and extending each rear leg in a dancing motion. Dancing Doberman disease progresses over a few years to rear leg weakness and muscle atrophy. No treatment is known, but most dogs retain the ability to walk and it is painless. *Diabetes neuropathy is more common in cats than dogs. It is caused in part by prolonged hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and results in dysfunction of one or both tibial nerves and a plantigrade stance (down on the hocks). It may resolve with treatment of the diabetes. The pathology of this condition in cats has been shown to be very similar to diabetic neuropathy in humans. *Distal symmetric polyneuropathy symptoms include atrophy of the distal leg muscles and the muscles of the head, and rear limb weakness. No treatment is known and the prognosis is poor. This is most commonly seen in Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, St. Bernards, Great Danes, Newfoundlands, Collies, and Labrador Retrievers. *Dysautonomia is primarily seen in cats. Symptoms include vomiting, depression, anorexia, weight loss, dilated pupils, third eyelid protrusion, sneezing, slow heart rate, and megaesophagus. The prognosis is poor and supportive treatment is necessary. Recovery in cats may take up to one year. *Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare disease in the German Shepherd dog. It usually becomes evident between the ages of 14 and 16 months. Symptoms include rear limb weakness, decreased reflexes, muscle atrophy, megaesophagus, and loss of bark. No treatment is known and it has a poor prognosis. *Hyperchylomicronemia or hyperlipoproteinemia is a type of inherited hyperlipidemia in cats. Polyneuropathy is caused by stretching or compression of nerves near bone by xanthomas, which are lipid deposits. It can cause Horner's syndrome, facial nerve paralysis, and femoral nerve, tibial nerve, radial nerve, trigeminal nerve, or recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. *Hypertrophic neuropathy is also known as canine inherited demyelinative neuropathy (CIDN) and is inherited in the Tibetan Mastiff. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 7 and 10 weeks, and include weakness, decreased reflexes, and loss of bark. Sensory function remains, but a poor gait or an inability to walk may present. With no treatment available, the prognosis is guarded. The trait is inherited as an autosomal recessive. *Hypoglycemia-induced polyneuropathy is especially seen in conjunction with insulinoma. *Myasthenia gravis *Polyradiculoneuritis is inflammation of the nerve roots. The most common type is Coonhound paralysis. This is similar to Guillain–Barré syndrome in humans. Coonhound paralysis seems to be secondary to a raccoon bite, probably due to some factor in the saliva. However, it can also occur without any interaction with a raccoon. It can happen in any breed of dog. When associated with a raccoon bite, the symptoms start 7 to 11 days after the bite, and include rear leg weakness progressing rapidly to paresis, and decreased reflexes. When not associated with a raccoon bite, the same symptoms occur, with the paresis taking about 3–4 days to reach its maximum effect. Severe cases have a loss of bark, trouble breathing, and an inability to lift the head. Typically, the duration of the paralysis is 2 to 3 months, but can last up to 6 months. Treatment is proper nursing care, and the prognosis is good in mild cases. In bad cases, the dog does not completely recover the initial muscular capability but still is able to live for years. In very bad cases, breathing can be impaired, and unless the dog is placed on a ventilator, suffocation will occur. Polyradiculoneuritis has also been seen 1-2o weeks after vaccination in dogs and cats. It can also be caused by toxoplasmosis. *Rottweiler distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy is characterized by distal muscle denervation, but the cause is unknown. It affects young adult Rottweilers. The symptoms include weakness of all four legs and decreased reflexes. The disease is gradually progressive. Treatment is possible with corticosteroids, but the prognosis is poor. *Sensory neuropathies are inherited conditions in dogs and cause an inability to feel pain and a loss of proprioception. Self-mutilation is often seen. No treatment has been found, and the prognosis is poor in severe cases. Several breeds are affected: **Boxer symptoms usually occur around two months of age as a slowly progressive disease. **Dachshund (longhaired) disease usually occurs between 8 and 12 weeks of age, and causes urinary incontinence, loss of pain sensation all over the body, and penis mutilation. It is probably inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. **English Pointer illness usually occurs between the ages of 3 and 8 months and most commonly involves licking and biting at the paws. No treatment is known and a poor prognosis is given. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. *Spinal muscular atrophy occurs in cats and dogs, and is caused by the death of nerve cells in the spinal cord. This progressive disease has no known treatment and a poor prognosis. Affected dog breeds include the Swedish Lapland Dog, Brittany Spaniel, English Pointer, German Shepherd dog, Rottweiler, and Cairn Terrier. Maine Coons are one of the affected cat breeds. *Tick paralysis is an acute, ascending motor paralysis that occurs in dogs and cats. The cause is a neurotoxin in the saliva of certain species of adult ticks. Dermacentor species predominate as a cause in North America, while Ixodes species mainly cause the disease in Australia. The onset of symptoms is 5 to 9 days after tick attachment, and include incoordination progressing to paralysis, changed voice, and difficulty eating. Death can occur secondary to paralysis of the respiratory muscles, but in North America, a good prognosis results once the ticks are removed. Recovery is usually in 1 to 3 days. In Australia, however, it is a more severe disease with cranial nerve effects, and death can occur in 1 to 2 days. *Toxic neuropathies are most commonly caused by vincristine, thallium, and lead. In cats, the symptoms include paresis, hyporeflexia, and muscle tremors.Chandler, E. A.; et al. (2004) Feline Medicine and Therapeutics.

It is a famous surf break and today the start of the large sand bank known to surfers as the Superbank. History Snapper Rocks viewed from Greenmount Hill across Rainbow Bay, 1891 Snapper Rocks, Coolangatta, viewed from the south, circa 1934 It is believed that Snapper Rocks were named by W.L. Edwardson, captain of HM Colonial Cutter Snapper which passed by Point Danger in July 1822.  Surfing  Snapper is a point break, which as of 2007, forms the first part of the man-made \\"Superbank\\" surf break. Since 1995 the Tweed River sand bypass system has pumped sand from the Tweed River mouth to beaches to the north to ensure the river mouth is safe for shipping, and to stabilise coastal erosion north of the river. This has resulted in a large build-up of sand between Snapper Rocks to Kirra, which as of 2007, has extended the beaches in this area seawards around 100-200m, and created a new, world-class sandbar surf break called \\"the Superbank\\". The Superbank extends from Snapper Rocks Point, through Rainbow Bay, Greenmount Point, Coolangatta Beach, and Kirra, for a distance of around . Multiple barrel sections can now occur at any point along this length. The quality of the surf in the first 4 of these sections has markedly improved since the 1990s, creating one of the longest, hollowest and best waves in the world. However, the quality of the last section, Kirra, which has long been regarded as one of the world's best waves prior to the formation of the Superbank, has suffered. There have been calls to modify aspects of the sand bypass system to attempt to restore Kirra to its former quality, although exactly how this is to be done is not clear. It is possible that an optimum, medium build-up of sand (such as was reportedly the state in the early 2000s) may create the longest and best waves over the entire length, including Kirra. The sheer quality of the man-made wave has greatly increased the level of surf tourism in the region, which has also resulted in extreme crowding of the wave. On a good day, over 500 surfers can be counted over the distance, with multiple drop-ins.  Pool  Snapper Rocks Sea Baths In 1956 Jack Evans built the Snapper Rocks Sea Baths, with an adjacent shark pool for public viewing. Later that year the Boyd brothers, local fishermen, caught two bottlenose dolphins in the Terranora Creek which Evans took and put in the pool for the Jack Evans Porpoise Pool show.. The pools moved to the mouth of the Tweed River near to Duranbah beach in 1961. Only remnants of the pools remain today.

During the mid-1970s it was one of the first pubs to embrace the emergent, but brief, phenomenon of pub rock. With the decline of this movement, the pub went on to become a leading venue in the punk rock movement. The Hope and Anchor is still an operational pub and live music venue today, owned and operated by the Greene King brewing company. Venue facilities have been improved via refurbishments over the years. It is a Grade II listed building.  History  Hope and Anchor can trace its history back to when the building was built in 1880. When The Tally Ho pub in Kentish Town decided to switch from showcasing rock music to Irish music, Hope and Anchor became the venue to go to in north London. The nights grew and developed under the stewardship of managers Fred Grainger and Dave Robinson, both of whom later moved on to other things (Fred to open a nightclub in Brighton, Dave to co-found independent record label Stiff Records with Jake Riviera). In January 1976, the venue was acquired by Albion Management and Agency, who installed John Eichler as the landlord. In the light of numerous threats of closure, Eichler organised various benefits in order to keep the pub open, with well-established bands returning to the pub to perform for only expenses. Ian Grant of Albion Management and Agency narrowed down a long list to a final twenty two bands – all of which had played at the pub previously. Hope & Anchor Front Row Festival, which took place between Tuesday 22 November and Thursday 15 December 1977, featured numerous pub rock, punk, and new wave groups. The recordings were issued as a live double album of the same name, which reached No. 28 in the UK Albums Chart.  Notable acts  Unfortunately, few records exist of groups who performed at the Hope and Anchor. Below are a few (of the many) that are known to have played; * 999 * Adam and the Ants * Brainiac 5 * Brinsley Schwarz * Burlesque * Cauda Pavonis * Children on Stun * Dire Straits * Dr Feelgood * Generation X * Graham Parker & the Rumour * Ian Gomm * Janus Stark (24 October 2019) * Joe Jackson * Joy Division (Debut London gig; 27 December 1978) * Keane (Debut gig; 13 July 1998) * Madness * Madness (The music video for their cover of \\"One Step Beyond\\" was filmed in the basement) * Plummet Airlines * Ramones * Roogalator * Squeeze * Steel Pulse * Steve Gibbons Band * Stray Cats * Suburban Studs * The banshee * The Clash * The Cure * The Damned (Recorded the promotional video for \\"New Rose\\" here on 7 December 1976) * The Jam * The Mekons * The Men They Couldn't Hang * The Motors * The Only Ones * The Pogues * The Police * The Riots (2005) * The Saints * The Specials * The Stranglers * Tom Robinson Band * Tyla Gang * U2 (Mislabelled at the time as \\"The U2's\\" – Posters in the venue show this)] * Wayne County & the Electric Chairs * X-Ray Spex * XTC The actual performance space at Hope and Anchor was, at the time, a spartan and rather grubby basement space, alternately dank or overheated, and always smoky, but this in many ways suited the anarchic ideals of late-1970s live music. It was here that The Stranglers recorded their album Live at the Hope and Anchor. The demo of the 'Between You and Me' track as used on the Howling Wind first Graham Parker album was recorded in the basement.  Layout  The venue is made up of five floors, of which only three are accessible to the public. = Basement = The basement is the famous live music venue, and still operates as one today. It can be hired out by various promoters and groups for music shows. The maximum legal capacity is 80 persons, down from its previous maximum of 120. The stage has recently reverted to its seventies configuration with the bar located opposite the entrance door, and the stage adjacent to the recently modernised basic toilets, next to the emergency fire escape. At some point in its long history, the venue was converted to run as both a live music venue and as a recording studio, although the latter functionality has since been lost. = Ground floor = The ground floor contains the main bar, and a space for 120 people. There is a staircase by the main door (Upper Street entrance) leading to the basement. The side door leads to Islington Park Street. A staircase at the rear provides access to the first floor. The ground floor has a jukebox and fruit machine. The walls are lined with posters, tickets and albums recorded at gigs there. = First floor = The first floor contains both male and female toilets. There used to be an upstairs bar located in the area here, which was later converted into a pool hall, as well as a lounge bar. It then became a private-hire function room. Since November 2013 The Hope Theatre is housed on the second floor of the pub.

McCormick died on October 16, 1941, of a cerebral hemorrhage, at his home in Beverly Hills, California. =Legacy= Orson Welles claimed that McCormick's lavish promotion of Walska's opera career--despite her renown as a terrible singer-- was a direct influence on the screenplay for Citizen Kane, wherein the titular character does much the same for his second wife.

Early life David Weber was born in Vilna in present-day Lithuania and came to the United States in 1921. His family settled in Detroit. His parents were not musical, but he liked the sound of clarinet and took it up at the age of 11. While in high school, he studied under Roy Schmidt and Alberto Luconi, principal clarinetists of the Detroit Symphony. In 1933 Ossip Gabrilowitsch, then conductor of the Detroit Symphony, was impressed by Weber's playing and helped him get a New York Philharmonic Scholarship. This allowed Weber to study without fee in New York with Simeon Bellison, the New York Philharmonic's principal clarinetist. Around the same time he also studied with Daniel Bonade, principal clarinet with the Columbia Broadcast System Symphony.Liner notes by Michael Weber (2001) accompanying \\"A Portrait of David Weber: 'A Grand Master of the Clarinet' (Clarinet Classics CD CC0041) Orchestral career Weber's orchestral career began at age 25, with a 1938 audition for Arturo Toscanini, who personally hired Weber on the spot to play in the NBC Symphony. Weber played with the orchestra for two years as associate principal and e-flat clarinet, but was replaced just before the orchestra's 1940 tour of South America for a more experienced player. He instead went on to audition for Erich Leinsdorf, head of German repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, who awarded him the principal clarinet position, which he held from 1940-1943. Weber went on to serve as assistant principal in the New York Philharmonic under former teacher Simeon Bellison. He held this position from 1943–1944 and took part in Leonard Bernstein's debut on November 14, 1943. He was principal clarinetist in the CBS Symphony Orchestra from 1946–1952, and then assumed the same position in the Symphony of the Air (the successor to the NBC Symphony) under Leopold Stokowski from 1954-1957. After serving as the assistant principal for several years, in 1964, he became principal clarinetist in the New York City Ballet Orchestra, a position he held until his retirement from performing in 1986. While he was a member of the orchestra, legendary choreographer Jerome Robbins created a ballet to Igor Stravinsky's Three Pieces for Solo Clarinet, featuring only Weber's playing. Recordings Weber has been featured on many recordings. He can be heard performing the e-flat clarinet solos in Toscanini's recordings of the Daphnis and Chloe Suite No. 2 and Richard Strauss' Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks. He played first clarinet in Stokowski's Symphony of the Air recordings. In a 78 RPM set released by Musicraft Records in early 1939, Weber and pianist Ray Lev collaborated in the first recording of the Johannes Brahms Sonata in F minor, op. 120 no. 1, in its original instrumentation for clarinet and piano.\\"February Records,\\" Time, February 6, 1939 In 2002, Clarinet Classics released a CD entitled \\"A Portrait of David Weber: A Grand Master of the Clarinet,\\" featuring recordings of David Weber from 1946 through 1978. Legacy David Weber was perhaps best known for the quality of his tone. According to The New York Times, \\"His sound was full, rich, resonant and pure.\\" Current American Ballet Theater principal and acclaimed recording artist Jon Manasse described his teacher's sound as having \\"a unique bell-like quality\\". Stokowski described Weber's sound as being \\"like a dove cooing.\\" Weber used a double-lip embouchure and though many of his students did not, he implored his students to strive for a \\"rich, liquid, legatissimo sound\\" that one could \\"reach out and touch.\\" Teaching Weber, who long had an interest in teaching clarinet, devoted himself to teaching at Columbia University and the Juilliard School of Music after leaving the New York City Ballet Orchestra in 1986. Many of his students became prominent clarinetists themselves and teachers in the United States and other countries. Former students currently occupy chairs in the Cleveland Orchestra, Dallas Symphony, Rochester Philharmonic, and Milwaukee Symphony and include noted soloist Jon Manasse and jazz clarinetist Kenny Davern, who initially studied saxophone in the same building that Weber taught in, only to become mesmerized by the sound of the clarinet playing coming from Weber's studio. The jazz clarinetist Benny Goodman also studied under Weber, who claimed Goodman never paid him and took his best reeds. Weber continued teaching privately until June 2005, at which point he was a robust 92 years old. Death He died in New York City.

Population: History Local authorities advertise Cherdyn to tourists as the capital of the ancient Principality of Great Perm.\\"Article on Great Perm\\" \\"Article on Cherdyn\\" This information is based on an 1835 study by the Swedish historian A.M. StrinnholmA. M. Strinnholm. Svenska folkets historia fran aldesta till narvarande tider, 1835. as well as the 1815 study by the Russian historian Nikolay Karamzin.N. M. Karamzin, History of the Russian State, 1815. Strinnholm mentioned that the last trip of Scandinavian Vikings to Bjarmia (aka the Great Perm) happened in 1222. Four well-equipped ships of Haakon IV of Norway burned Bjarmian towns to the ground. After that, the fur trade between the Great Perm and Western Europe was possible only via the Novgorod Republic, which became the suzerain of all Northern Russia. After the centralization of Russian principalities by the Grand Dukes of Moscow, the princes of Perm, who already had Russian names, became their vassals as well as answering to Novgorod. Great Perm–Cherdyn supplied a great deal of silver paid as tribute of Moscow, which in turn paid the Golden Horde. Tension between Moscow and Novgorod led to a war of 1471, after which the defeated Novgorod Republic was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The next year (1472) Cherdyn, Pokcha, and all other towns of Great Perm also became the prizes of conquest. The main fort of the Muscovites was built in Pokcha, located to the north of Cherdyn. It was burned by indigenous tribes in the beginning of the 16th century. Cherdyn, as well as all of Perm, was still governed by the dynasty of local Great Perm princes until 1505. After that, the Grand Duke sent a governor from Moscow, and he chose Cherdyn as his residence. In 1535, Cherdyn was granted town rights. It was the starting point of an early river route to Siberia. Following the establishment of the Babinov Road—a more traveled overland route—the town quickly lost its significance. View of Cherdyn in 1912 Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Cherdyn serves as the administrative center of Cherdynsky District, to which it is directly subordinated.Law #416-67 As a municipal division, the town of Cherdyn is incorporated within Cherdynsky Municipal District as Cherdynskoye Urban Settlement.Law #1735-355 Climate Cherdyn has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dfc), with very cold winters and warm summers.

It was Bush's fourth State of the Union Address and his fifth speech to a joint session of the United States Congress. Presiding over this joint session was the House Speaker, Dennis Hastert, accompanied by Dick Cheney, the Vice President of the United States. Introduction President Bush began his State of the Union address by saying that the United States Government has a \\"great privilege\\" of being \\"placed in office by the votes of the people we serve. And tonight that is a privilege we share with newly-elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian Territories, Ukraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq,\\" a reference to the first truly democratic, and relatively fair and free, elections that took place in the respective nations.

He attributed the economic turn around to his tax cuts, specifically lower income taxes, free trade initiatives, prosecution of corporate criminals.

LEAF was created by founding mother Doris Anderson and other women.http://www.leaf.ca/about-leaf/history/ Mandate :To ensure the rights of women and girls in Canada, as guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, are upheld in courts, human rights commissions and government agencies; and to take actions to reveal how factors such as race, class, Aboriginal status, sexual orientation, ability, and religion compound discrimination against women. Controversies Some of the cases the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund have intervened in proved to be controversial. These include the Acquittal of Bassam Al Rawi, and the case of Nicole Patricia Ryan, also known as Nicole Doucet Ryan, who was arrested after attempting to hire an undercover Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer as a hit man to kill her husband. The defense claimed she was under duress due to an abusive relationship in which the RCMP had ignored her requests for help. Neither the RCMP nor the husband was called to testify against her accusations, however both refuted her claims.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/02/01/ns-nicole- ryan-doucet-rcmp-deny-report-abuse.htmlhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova- scotia/story/2013/01/23/ns-hitman-michael-ryan.html LEAF's interventions may impact legal rules both directly and indirectly. Peter Manfredi concludes that the area where legal change made the most significant practical achievement was in the area of abortion rights. LEAF's defence of the elimination that only hospitals may perform abortions had far-reaching implications for women, with a significant increase in the number of legal abortions performed after 1988.http://www.rdo- olr.uottawa.ca/index2.php?option=com_sobi2&sobi2Task;=dd_download&fid;=598&Itemid;=842 Manfredi footnotes that since LEAF's confusing interventions in the obscenity debate, LEAF experienced two consecutive losses and ponders that it may be too early to tell whether these losses signal a change in the relationship between LEAF and the Supreme Court. LEAF has often suffered other significant losses at the Supreme Court, but it has proved resilient in attracting funding and intervening status at the Supreme Court of Canada. Some have accused LEAF of being \\"as much about healing wounds within the [lesbian] feminist movement as it [is] about achieving a particular legal objective\\". Mary Eberts controversially represented Beth Symes, another founding LEAF mother in Symes v. Canada, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 695 http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc- csc/en/item/1093/index.do in which LEAF, while not on the docket, made its presence known through the works cited by the high court. While LEAF never formally represented Symes, its tacit intervention did not prevent the Court's decision in disallowing Symes' child care deductions as business expenses.

Description The engine was an upgraded version of the slightly smaller HL210 engine, The HL210 was used to equip the first 250 Tiger I tanks built, and unlike the HL230 had an aluminium crankcase and block. The HL210 engine had a displacement of or 1,779 cm³ per cylinder; bore , stroke . The HL230 engine bore was increased from 125 mm to 130 mm. It had a displacement of or 1,925 cm³ per cylinder; bore , stroke . The maximum output of 700 PS (690 hp, 515 kW) at 3,000 rpm. Maximum torque is 1850 Nm (1364.5 ft lbs) at 2,100 rpm. Typical output was 600 PS (592 hp, 441 kW) at 2,500 rpm. The crankcase and block were made of grey cast iron and the cylinder heads from cast iron. The engine weighed 1200 kg and its dimensions were 1000 × 1190 × 1310 mm. Aspiration was provided by four twin-choke Solex type 52JFF carburettors. Ignition was by two magnetos. The compression ratio was 6.8:1. As was typical practice for Maybach, the engine used a tunnel crankshaft. Late in the war the HL234 upgrade with fuel injection was recommended by the Entwicklungskommission Panzer for use in the underpowered Tiger II tank. The power output was expected to increase to between 800 and 900 PS (hp), and with supercharging to 1100 to 1200 hp.

Its name derives from the tradition of avoiding the lighting of any kind of fire, even for the preparation of food. This practice originally occurred at midwinter for as long as a month, but the hardship this involved led to repeated attempts to ban its observance out of concern for its practitioners. By the end of the Three Kingdoms Period (3rd century), it was limited to three days in the spring around the Qingming solar term. Under the Tang, ancestral observance was limited to the single day which is now celebrated as the Tomb-Sweeping Festival. The Cold Food Festival is not an official holiday in any country or region, but it continues to see some observance in China, South Korea, and Vietnam. Legend The usual story for the origin of the Cold Food and Tomb-Sweeping Festivals concerns the 7th- century- Jin nobleman Jie Zhitui, a model of self-sacrificing loyalty. During the Spring and Autumn Period of Chinese history, the Zhou Kingdom began to break up into its constituent parts and their lords gained more and more freedom from central control. One of these states was Jin, around modern Shanxi. As was common among wealthy Chinese at the time, its duke had many wives. One of them, Li Ji, was of lower status and came from the Rong tribes who lived to China's west, but successfully schemed to become a full wife and to establish her son as the duke's successor. Her older stepson Ji Chong'er was framed for revolting against the duke in 655, forcing the prince to flee for his life to his mother's family among the Di tribes north of China. Only 15 of his men followed him into exile. These included Jie Zhitui, who entertained the prince with his poems and music. He was so considerate of his lord that once, when their supplies were stolen while traveling through Wey, he used meat from his own thigh to make soup to relieve the prince's hunger. In 636, the duke of Qin finally invaded Jin on Chong'er's behalf and installed him as its duke. (Posthumously, he became known as the \\"Wen\\" or \\"Civilized Duke\\" of Jin.) In 635, the new duke was generous to those who had helped him in adversity but overlooked Jie, who sadly withdrew into poor obscurity in the forests near . The duke sent repeated envoys to lure Jie back to court, but he felt no ambition for political power. Too loyal to directly criticize his master but too principled to accept a place in a corrupt administration,. he opted to simply remain in seclusion. Annoyed, the duke ordered a forest fire to be started around three sides of the mountain to smoke Jie and his mother out of hiding. Instead of coming out, they were burnt alive. Jie's charred corpse was found still standing, embracing. or tightly bound to a tree. In his remorse, the duke renamed the mountain Mt.Jie, established the town still known as Jiexiu (\\"Jie's Rest\\"), and inaugurated the Cold Food Festival as a memorial period for Jie. In addition to the festival, the story also occasioned the Chinese proverb that, \\"while some can burn off an entire mountain, others are kept from even lighting up to eat their rice\\". History Li Tang's The Civilized Duke of Jin Recovering His State (1140) The first part of this legend appears to be historical. In the earliest accounts, however, Jie is more prideful than sad and is not killed in a fire. The 4th-century- commentary on Confucius's Spring and Autumn Annals traditionally credited to Zuo Qiuming includes a Thucydidean passage where Jie argues with his mother about their future. Jie credits Heaven with having restored Chong'er to his rightful place and is disgusted by the credit-seeking and job-hunting behavior of his fellows, whom he considers worse than thieves. He also finds his lord unworthy for failing to reward him despite his failure to present himself at court. His mother asks him to at least go before the duke,.. but Jie admits his bitter criticism of the other lords makes that impossibly embarrassing. His mother accepts his decision to withdraw to a hermitage and goes with him. Ji Chong'er belatedly remembers his obligations to Jie and looks for him. When this proves vain, he accepts the situation and sets aside the produce of the fields of \\"Mëenshang\\" to endow sacrifices in Jie's honor, \\"a memento... of my neglect and a mark of distinction for the good man\\".. Other sources from the Zhou and early Han mention and praise Jie for various reasons. The poems of the Songs of Chu extol him for his loyalty and proper treatment of his lord's forgetfulness. The Spring and Autumn Annals compiled under Lü Buwei praises his altruism and lack of personal ambition. At some point before the composition of the Han-era Biographies of the Immortals, Jie came to be revered as a Taoist immortal.. The Cold Food Festival is first mentioned in Huan Tan's New Discussions, composed around the beginning of the 1st century. It records that the commoners of Taiyuan Commandery avoided using fire in preparing their food for five days around midwinter, upholding this taboo even when they are gravely ill. This was done in Jie Zhitui's honor. A biography in the Book of the Later Han relates how the magistrate for Bingzhou (i.e., Taiyuan) found people rich and poor observing a \\"dragon taboo\\" against lighting a fire during the month of Jie's death in midwinter, lest they anger his spirit. Many of the old and young died every year because of the hardship this brought. The magistrate Zhou Ju wrote an oration around 130 praising Jie but admonishing the people for a tradition that harmed so many that it could not have been what the sage intended. He then had the oration displayed at Jie's temple and distributed among the poor. This did not end the Cold Food Festival, but the biography notes that local superstitions did improve \\"to a certain extent\\".. The improvement is not explained but, at some point over the next century, it moved from the middle of winter to late spring, 105 days after the dongzhi solar term. Since it also spread from Taiyuan to the surrounding commanderies of Shangdang, Xihe, and Yanmen and was still causing some hardship, Cao Cao attempted to outlaw the Cold Food Festival in 206. The heads of offending families were liable for 6 months' hard labor, their local official was liable for one month himself, and their magistrate was to lose one month's salary.. Cao Cao's effort was a failure, with observance of the Cold Food Festival on Qingming and for up to a month around it being reported by the mid-3rd century.. Shi Le, the Jie emperor of the Later Zhao in the early 4th century, again tried to forbid it. The next year a massive hailstorm devastated crops and forests throughout Shanxi. On the advice of his ministers, he again approved the festival in the region around Taiyuan.. The Northern Wei similarly banned the festival in 478 and 496, but were also compelled to approve its observance around .. These prohibitions failed to such an extent that, by the time of Jia Sixie's Qimin Yaoshu, a day-long Cold Food Festival had spread across most of China, moved to the day before the Qingming solar term. The Cold Food Festival grew to a three-day period. and began to incorporate ancestral veneration under the Tang and remained more important than celebrations of the Qingming solar term as late as the Song.. The present Tomb-Sweeping Festival on Qingming grew by incorporating the Cold Food observances. along with the separate holiday of Shangsi. The Cold Food Festival had almost completely disappeared by the end of the Qing. Controversy Since the early 7th century, Chinese and Western scholars have argued for alternative origins for the festival. Du Gongzhan, the editor of the late-Sui Record of the Seasons of Jingchu, connected it with a ritual avoidance of fire mentioned in the Rites of Zhou: \\"In mid-spring, they announce the prohibition of fire in the capital using a bell with a wooden clapper\\".. This prohibition was related to the ancient Chinese use of different kinds of firewood according to the seasons, particularly after the development of Chinese astrology that considered the heliacal rising of Antares to be an occasion for great risk of conflagration and wildfire. Du was followed in his conjecture by others, including Li Fu.. The Sinologist J.J.M. de Groot argued for its origin as a celebration of the sun's \\"victory\\" at the vernal equinox, based on a comparative anthropological analysis drawing on Ovid, Macrobius, Lucian, and Epiphanius of Salamis. James Frazer and his followers similarly considered it either a \\"sun-charm\\" or \\"purification\\" from its similarities to other \\"fire-festivals\\". Claude Lévi-Strauss based his analysis of the festival as a kind of Chinese Lent upon a mistranslation of the relevant passage in the Rites of Zhou by Frazer. Eberhard connected it with his idea of a prehistoric spring-based calendar and made the Cold Food Festival a remnant of its original New Year. The unanimous connection of the festival to Jie Zhitui in the early sources and the dependence of these later theories on the Cold Food Festival's occurrence in late spring—when it in fact began as a mid-winter observance—suggests that none of them are likely accurate. One contemporary record of ritual fire-avoidance coming from a separate source in southeastern China concerned the late-2nd-century \\"kings\\" of \\"Yue\\" Mi (, Yuè Míwáng) and Yao (, Yuè Wáng Yáo,. and , Yuè Yáowáng).. These were actually princes of the old Yue royal family fighting over the southern successor state of Minyue. Supposedly, the Mi King was beheaded during a battle with Yao but his body continued to stay atop his horse all the way back to \\"Wu Village\\", where he was buried. As late as the 10th century, residents of the area avoided fire on the day of his death as a mark of respect to his spirit.. This southern equivalent to the Cold Food Festival was not celebrated annually, though, but on every \\"wu day\\" of the old Chinese calendar,. a generally unlucky day to some Taoists.. Observance =China= The Cold Food Festival was originally observed at mid-winter (the Dongzhi solar term), but moved to late spring (the Qingming solar term) around the 2nd century. Its primary activity was a strict taboo against using fire, usually under the superstitious belief that violations led to violent weather. Leading up to the 6th century, there was a patch of blackened trees on that were used for local worship of Jie Zhitui and had a reputation for miracles. Traditional cold foods included lǐlào , a kind of congee flavored with apricot pits and malt sugar. Later activities included visiting ancestral tombs, cock fighting, playing on swings, beating blankets, and tug-of-war games. The Cold Food Festival is generally ignored in modern China, except to the extent that it has influenced some of the activities and traditional foods for the Tomb- Sweeping Festival. In the city of Jiexiu in Shanxi Province, near where Jie died, locals still commemorate the festival, but even there the tradition of eating cold food is no longer practiced. =South Korea= The Korean equivalent Hansik (Hangul: 한식), takes place on the 105th day after dongzhi, which translates to April 5 in the Gregorian calendar, except in leap years when it is on April 4 instead. It is a day to welcome the warm weather thawing the frozen lands. On this day, rites to worship ancestors are observed early in the morning, and the family visits their ancestors' tombs to tidy up. The custom of eating cold food on the day has, however, disappeared. Since this day coincides with Arbor Day, public cemeteries are crowded with visitors planting trees around the tombs of their ancestors. =Vietnam= The Vietnamese equivalent Tết Hàn Thực is celebrated in most parts of the country on the 3rd day of the 3rd lunar month, but only marginally. People cook glutinous rice balls called bánh trôi but the holiday's origins are largely forgotten, and the fire taboo is also largely ignored.

He played on the early Giants teams under manager John McGraw and was the primary catcher for Hall of Famer Christy Mathewson. Meyers hit over .300 for three straight years as the Giants won three straight National League pennants from 1911 to 1913. Overall, he played in four World Series – the 1911, 1912, and 1913 Series with the Giants, as well as the 1916 Series with the Robins. Meyers was a Native American from the Cahuilla culture of California, and he was educated at Dartmouth College. Early years Meyers was born to John Meyer and Felicite Meyer, a Cahuilla Indian, in Riverside, California. At the age of seven, his father died; John Meyers continued to live in Riverside, and attended Riverside High School. Meyers was playing baseball in a 1905 summer tournament when Ralph Glaze, a former pitcher, noticed his talent and convinced Dartmouth alumni to provide Meyers with cash, railroad tickets, and a doctored high school diploma. Meyers had not graduated, but the fake diploma got him into Dartmouth. While attending classes and playing baseball, Dartmouth discovered that his diploma was forged. Not wanting to complete a special program to be reinstated into Dartmouth, Meyers signed a baseball contract with an independent league. New York Giants Domino Disc, issued by Kinney Brothers Tobacco Co. After playing a couple years in various leagues, Meyers was a rookie with the New York Giants in 1908, at age 28. Meyers and the Giants lost the pennant that year due to \\"Merkle's Boner.\\" The following year, the Giants traded away Roger Bresnahan, the best catcher in the league, to the St. Louis Cardinals, which gave the young catcher an opportunity to display his talent, and Meyers didn't disappoint. In 1910, Meyers was hitting .285 making a name for himself throughout the league. Meyers was big and strong, and like the majority of other catchers, wasn't blessed with speed. He hit for power and average. Meyers led the Giants in batting for three consecutive seasons. He was a student of the game, predicting pitchers' pitches and location. Facing elimination against the Athletics in Game 6 of the 1911 World Series, Meyers' Giants trailed 6–1 entering the bottom of the seventh in Philadelphia. After Chief Bender opened the frame with a flyout, two singles and an error by first baseman Fred Merkle fielding a throw on a sacrifice bunt made the score 7–1. Two consecutive singles would score two further runs, then with runners at the corners, Harry Davis hit a 2–1 pitch into right-center to make it 10–1. Continuing the rally, Jack Barry hit a ground rule double into the right field crowd scoring another run and putting runners at second and third, which finally convinced John McGraw to replace his pitcher, Hooks Wiltse, having given up 7 earned runs over 2 1/3 innings. Future Hall of Famer Rube Marquard, who had gone 24–7 that year with a 2.50 ERA and a career-high 237 strikeouts, came into pitch with two runners in scoring position and his team down by ten. His third pitch was so fast and wild that it \\"dented the screen in the grand stand\\". Both runners scored on the play because Meyers \\"refused to chase the ball\\", instead \\"glaring at Marquard\\" in obvious frustration. After a \\"heated conference\\" between the battery mates near home plate, order ensued, but the next batter promptly singled off Marquard. The emotional and adrenaline-fueled Meyers then threw out the runner trying to steal second base, stopping the rally. The next batter struck out, ending the inning, although the 11-run lead would prove enough to secure a championship for Philadelphia. Meyers had his greatest success in the 1912 season, hitting .358 and finishing third in the MVP award voting. His .441 on-base percentage led the league. Meyers was also a key player in that year's World Series versus the Boston Red Sox, which featured the infamous \\"Snodgrass Muff\\" as well as captivating performances by Mathewson and Smoky Joe Wood. =Mathewson and Meyers= Meyers was the primary catcher for Hall of Fame pitcher Christy Mathewson. In only two years of playing Major League Baseball, Meyers teamed up with the great Christy Mathewson, putting on a sketch entitled \\"Curves\\", written by their co-star May Tully. The half-hour sketch included both Mathewson and Meyers explaining the art of their position. This wasn't the only project they teamed up for, as both Mathewson and Meyers would act in another sketch which toured for several weeks. Late career At the age of 35—Meyers claimed that he was younger than he actually was—his performance started to decline as he batted just .232, and Giants placed him on waivers. In 1916, he played 80 games for the Brooklyn Robins, batting .247 with 21 RBIs. In 1917, be played 47 games for the Robins, and 25 games for the Boston Braves. Overall for the 1917 season, he batted .225 with 7 RBIs. After getting cut in 1918, Meyers joined the Buffalo Bisons of the International League; he batted .328 in 65 games. In 1919, Meyers was hired as player-manager of the New Haven Weissmen in the Eastern League; he batted .301 in 84 games. After getting replaced by Danny Murphy, Meyers' last stop in baseball was catching for a semipro team in San Diego in 1920. After getting booed at a semipro game, Meyers decided to quit baseball and became a police chief for the Mission Indian Agency. Personal life The media displayed affection for the Native American ball player because he was interesting and original. On off-days or rain outs, Meyers would visit historical monuments, watch local college teams practice, and frequently visited museums and exhibits. Meyers was interviewed by Lawrence Ritter for The Glory of Their Times in March 1964. This brought him a great deal of fame, years after he had left baseball. Meyers died in 1971 and was interred at Green Acres Memorial Park in Bloomington, California; his grave marker indicates he served as a private in the United States Marine Corps during World War I.

He played college basketball for the Indiana Hoosiers and played two seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the New York Knicks. Amateur career Anderson attended St. Francis DeSales High School on Chicago's far southeast side and was named 1988's Mr. Basketball for the state of Illinois as well as a McDonald's All-American in the same year. He appears in one scene in the documentary Hoop Dreams. Anderson then enrolled at Indiana University Bloomington, where he played for the Hoosiers while studying sociology. He was named Most Outstanding Player of 1992 NCAA Tournament's West Regional after helping lead Indiana to the Final Four. He completed his college career with 1,715 points and 825 rebounds. Professional career Anderson signed with the New York Knicks for the 1992–93 NBA season as an undrafted free agent. As the team's twelfth man, he played only 44 total minutes in sixteen games, and 39 minutes in eleven games the following season before being waived. He received a loud ovation by fans when inserted in the final six minutes of the Knicks' 114–79 home blowout over the Boston Celtics on February 2, 1994, in which he went scoreless with four personal fouls while the Knicks bench later stood and cheered his drawing an offensive foul. Anderson held NBA career averages of 1.6 points and 1.1 rebounds, and 2-for-2 on three-point field goals. He spent the remainder of his career playing in Europe and with the Fort Wayne Fury of the Continental Basketball Association until retiring in 1998. Personal life Anderson was married to fitness guru Tracy Anderson from 1998 to 2008 and had a son named Sam. Death Anderson died on December 9, 2018, in Carmel, Indiana. An autopsy was conducted, and preliminary findings suggested that he died of natural causes.

The story is one of James' few ventures into epistolary fiction. As he did so often, especially in the early stages of his career, James made the tale part of his international theme: his letter-writers represent a number of different countries. Although some of the characters look like well-worn stereotypes -- the wolfish Frenchman, the pedantic and aggressively nationalistic German, the snobbish upper-class English siblings -- James manages to endow most of them with enough twists and turns of personality to interest the reader. One character has even been taken as a sly satire on himself. Plot summary Several residents of a Paris boarding-house write letters to their friends and family back home; their primary subject is their reaction to each other. The main character is Miranda Hope, an angular but likeable Yankee Miss from Bangor, Maine who, quite bravely for a young woman of that era, is traveling in Europe alone. In her letters, she chatters to her mother about seeing the sights in Europe but doesn't like the Old World's treatment of its women, \\"and that is a point, you know, on which I feel very strongly.\\" Her expressions of petulance with William Platt, who we realize must have been a suitor of hers back in Maine, are so offhand as to be amusing. Although she is in general the least affected and most sympathetic character in the story, her unawareness of the disdain in which most of the characters hold each other (including herself) makes her seem somewhat naive. Meanwhile, society girl Violet Ray of New York writes to a friend that Miranda, who she sees as provincial, is \\"really too horrible.\\" Another boarder, wannabe aesthete Louis Leverett (quite possibly a self-satire by James) gushes in his letter that \\"the great thing is to live, you know,\\" amid much precious verbiage about the good, the true and the bee-a-u-tiful. An English boarder, Evelyn Vane, pens a scoffing note that Louis is always talking about the color of the sky, but she doubts if he's ever seen it except through a window-pane; and the German sees Leverett's \\"decadence\\" as further evidence that the English-speaking world is weak and ripe for takeover. The Frenchman Leon Verdier almost drools in his letter about the charms of ces demoiselles among the boarders, and focuses primarily on their appearance. The rather threatening German professor is the only character both cynical and intelligent enough to realize how disdainful all the English speakers are of each other. However, he's also the least sympathetic character in the story. (James disliked Germany and its culture.) While the other characters despise each other mostly on personal grounds, or from cultural misunderstanding, Herr Professor despises them all based on their national traits and general sub- human status (he calls the Frenchman \\"simian\\"). In a letter to his German friend, he simultaneously brags of his erudition and predicts that the weakness of these other nationalities augurs a bright future \\"for the deep- lunged children of the Fatherland!\\" Major themes In his New York Edition preface James says that he wrote this relaxed, very funny story in a single sitting: \\"an unusual straightness of labour.\\" Not much about the story seems labored, though, as James brought a great deal of the wit and sparkle of his own letters to those of his imagined correspondents. The story makes mostly light work of national differences, but the penultimate letter from Dr. Staub, the Deutschland-über-alles fanatic, sounds a jarring note of reality. James gives a final letter from Miranda to soften the harshness of Staub's rants-- and the similar harshness of James' attitude towards Germany. But readers today can't help but remember how Staub's words would find terrible fulfillment in the bloody first half of the 20th century. Finally, much of the humor in the piece comes from the characters' undercutting of each other's lies and pretensions, while none of them are aware that the others are writing about them. Only the reader really sees what's going on, which adds to the entertainment value of the piece. Critical evaluation This story was pirated in an unauthorized version before James could get the legitimate book through the press, which proves how popular and salable it was. The humor is immediate and vivid, and few critics have resisted the charm of James' sharply drawn characters. This was perhaps the best way James could approach writing for the drama, a long-cherished dream of his. He could forget about stage business and just let his characters reveal themselves in letters. Much critical talk has centered on the ranting German, Dr. Staub. Writing from a wartime point of view in 1945, Clifton Fadiman avowed that Staub showed how barbaric the German nation was. After four decades had allowed passions to cool, Edward Wagenknecht demurred that James' portrait of the doctrinaire pedant was jingoistic and unfair. Whatever the reader may make of these opinions, there's no question that Staub's letter is much different from the others and far more disturbing in its implications.

At issue were modifications not approved by the Mozilla Foundation, when the name for the software remained the same. The Debian Project subsequently rebranded the Mozilla Firefox program, and other software released by Mozilla, so that Debian could distribute modified software without being bound by the trademark requirements that the Mozilla Foundation had invoked. The new names established by Debian were Iceweasel for Mozilla Firefox, Icedove for Mozilla Thunderbird, and Iceape for SeaMonkey. These changes were implemented in the subsequent version of Debian (Etch). In July 2007, Iceowl, a rebranded version of Mozilla Sunbird, was added to the unstable branch of Debian. In 2016, a number of Mozilla employees and Debian maintainers argued that the branding was no longer needed, and on 10 March 2016, Debian's unstable branch switched back to the Mozilla branding, with the stable branch planning to switch after Iceweasel's end of life. The decade- long branding issues between the Debian Project and Mozilla Corporation ended in 2017 when all software was de-branded back to their original names. Applications Debian's Iceweasel, Icedove, Iceowl, and Iceape were based on Mozilla's Firefox, Thunderbird, Sunbird, and SeaMonkey, respectively. The rebranded products still used some Internet-based services from Mozilla, including the Mozilla plugin finder service, and Mozilla add-ons and their update notifications. There was also no change to how non-free components, such as Flash, were found or used. =Iceape= Iceape logo Iceape was a free software Internet suite based on SeaMonkey. It was developed by the Debian Mozilla Team in unison with the SeaMonkey Council's work on their release, but in accordance with Debian's policy of only using free content, copyrighted artwork and proprietary plug-ins were omitted. A temporary lack of community development support resulted in Iceape being absent from the repository for Debian 5 (\\"Lenny\\"), though the iceape-dev and iceape-dev-bin libraries remained available. Support later resumed with Debian 6 (\\"Squeeze\\"), and by early 2013, the package was available for both Squeeze and June's release of Debian 7 (\\"Wheezy\\"). As of December 2013 the Iceape package was no longer being maintained by the Debian project and users were encouraged to migrate to other packages for security patches. =Icedove= Icedove logo Icedove was the Debian project's rebranded version of the Mozilla Thunderbird e-mail client. In February 2017, Thunderbird packages were reintroduced into the Debian repositories, and on April 20, 2017, the Icedove package in Debian Stable was de-branded back to Thunderbird. =Iceowl= Iceowl was a calendar application distributed by the Debian project. It was based on Mozilla Sunbird, but was made entirely of free software. The Lightning calendar extension for Mozilla Thunderbird was rebranded as iceowl-extension. = Iceweasel =  History and origin of name  Mozilla Foundation owns the trademark \\"Firefox\\"; see History of Mozilla Firefox#Naming and claims the right to deny the use of the name and other trademarks to unofficial builds. The Debian Free Software Guidelines are used by the Debian project to determine whether a license is a free license, which in turn is used to determine whether something can be included in Debian. As the logo did not meet these requirements, it could not be used by software which was to be included in Debian. This effect of the Mozilla trademark policy led to a long debate within the Debian Project in 2004 and 2005. During this debate, the name \\"Iceweasel\\" was coined to refer to rebranded versions of Firefox. The first known use of the name in this context is by Nathanael Nerode, in reply to Eric Dorland's suggestion of \\"Icerabbit\\". It was intended as a parody of \\"Firefox\\". \\"Iceweasel\\" was subsequently used as the example name for a rebranded Firefox in the Mozilla Trademark Policy, and became the most commonly used name for a hypothetical rebranded version of Firefox. By January 1, 2005, such strategic rebranding had come to be referred to as the \\"Iceweasel route\\". The term \\"ice weasel\\" appeared earlier in a line which Matt Groening fictionally attributed to Friedrich Nietzsche: \\"Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it flips over, pinning you underneath. At night, the ice weasels come.\\" Debian was initially given permission to use the trademarks, and adopted the Firefox name. However, because the artwork in Firefox had a proprietary copyright license which was not compatible with the Debian Free Software Guidelines, the substituted logo had to remain.  Trademark agreement revocation  In February 2006, Mike Connor, representing the Mozilla Corporation, wrote to the Debian bug tracker and informed the project that Mozilla did not consider the way in which Debian was using the Firefox name to be acceptable. Connor confirmed that the Mozilla Corporation was revoking the previous agreement which allowed Debian to use the Firefox name. Further messages from Mike Connor clarified Mozilla's new trademark policies: usage of the Firefox name is not allowed unless the rest of the branding is used and all of the browser's changes are approved by Mozilla Corporation. As Debian releases are frozen on a long-term basis, software in the frozen stable releases needs to be patched for any newly discovered security issue. Under the revised guidelines, in order to use the Firefox name, approval from the Mozilla Corporation would have been required for all security patches, but the Debian project felt it could not put its security in the hands of an external corporation in that manner. The \\"Iceweasel\\" name was revived in the Debian community as a possible name to give the rebranded version of Firefox. The Iceweasel found in Debian is not GNU IceWeasel (now GNU IceCat) but a rebranded Firefox created by the Debian project. The Debian maintainer has stated that he will \\"get in touch with [the GNU IceCat/IceWeasel team] to see what we can do together\\". Similarly, Debian renamed Mozilla Thunderbird and SeaMonkey to Icedove and Iceape, respectively. Rebranding According to the Debian Package Tracking System,Debian Package Tracking System, retrieved 19 July 2013 Iceweasel, Icedove and Iceape were first accepted into the Debian project's unstable repository on November 20, 2006, on October 14, 2006, and on December 1, 2006, respectively. Icedove migrated to Etch and Thunderbird was removed on November 11, 2006. Iceape migrated to Etch on January 11, 2007 (the old Mozilla suite having previously been removed on October 6, 2006). Iceweasel migrated (and Firefox was removed) on January 18, 2007. Debian's first stable release to include Iceweasel, Icedove, and Iceape was Debian 4.0 (Etch), released April 8, 2007. Soon after the renaming Debian also replaced Mozilla's unbranded logos with new logos designed to fit with the new names, drawn by Ricardo Fernandez Fuentes.\\"copyright\\" file from Iceweasel package in Debian, version 2.0.0.2+dfsg-3  User agent sniffing  Some web sites do not recognise the browsers' user agent strings and refuse to work properly. As a workaround, Iceweasel 3.5.5 adds a \\"like Firefox x.x.x\\" string to the User-Agent. Firefox issue resolution Debian users who performed a \`dist-upgrade\` in June 2016 received the following system message. According to Chris Hoffman of PC World: After a decade, Debian and Mozilla are burying the hatchet. Iceweasel is about to re-assume its proper name. iceweasel (45.0esr-1) unstable; urgency=medium * The iceweasel package was replaced with the firefox-esr package. * Preferences under /etc/iceweasel/prefs will need to be copied manually to /etc/firefox-esr. * Other customizations under /etc/iceweasel will need additional manual steps, through CCK2 or addons. The developers of Parabola GNU/Linux-libre picked up the Iceweasel project and it continues to be maintained.

Like Mozilla, the default icons are under the same tri-license, but unlike Mozilla, there are no trademark restrictions.

Semus Sdibard (AC 1499) Medieval Charter styles The Poppleton manuscript preserves a grant supposedly made by King Nechtan to the monastery of St. Brigid at Abernethy, c. early sixth century: *Latin: Nectonius magnus filius Uuirp rex omnium prouiciarum Pictorum **English: \\"Great Nechtan, son of Uurp, King of all the provinces of the Picts\\" In the Scottish period, the charter styles vary at first, but later become more formulaic. Here are some examples from the early charter period. The Roman numeral which follows is the number given to the charter in Archibald C. Lawrie's Early Scottish Charters: Prior to A.D. 1153, (Glasgow, 1905): * Machbet filius Finlach et Gruoch filia Bodhe, rex et regina Scottorum (Lawrie, V.) ** English: \\"Macbeth son of Findláech and Gruoch daughter of Bodhe, King and Queen of the Scots\\". Source is the Registrum of the Priory of St Andrews, and the document is a Latin translation from an earlier Gaelic document, so the \\"rex Scottorum\\" style is not reliable * Malcolmus Dei gratia Scottorum basileus (X) ** \\"Malcolm by the Grace of God, High King of the Scots\\" * Edgarus Dei gratia Rex Scottorum (XVII: 1095) ** \\"Edgar by the Grace of God, King of the Scots\\" *Alexander Dei gratia Rex Scottorum (XXVII) ** \\"Alexander by the Grace of God, King of the Scots\\" * David Dei gratia Rex Scotiae (LXIX) ** \\"David by the Grace of God, King of Scotland\\" * David Dei gratia Rex Scottorum (CIV) ** \\"David by the Grace of God, King of the Scots\\" From David I onwards, the royal style is either \\"rex Scottorum\\" or \\"rex Scotiae\\". From the late Middle Ages to the Acts of Union In the late Middle Ages the styles \\"rex Scottorum\\" (\\"king of the Scots\\") and \\"rex Scotiae\\" (\\"king of Scotland\\") were used interchangeably. Similarly, the Monarchs of England could be referred to as the \\"king of the English\\" as indeed Edward II of England was in the Declaration of Arbroath (1320). King of the Scots was used in \\"The Declaration of the Clergy in favour of Robert the Bruce\\" (1334), as it was in the charter by which Edward Balliol ceded the southern counties of Scotland to England. However, in many other documents King of Scotland was the preferred style, including \\"The Letter of the Magnates of Scotland to the King of France\\" (1308), \\"The Settlement of Succession on Robert the Bruce\\" (1315), the Treaty of Corbeuil (1326), the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton (1328), the Papal Bull authorising the anointing of Scottish Kings (1329) and the Treaty of Berwick (1357). This remained the case until the last three monarchs of Scotland, William II, Mary II and Anne, who became Queen of Great Britain following the Acts of Union 1707. Your Grace Scottish monarchs were addressed as \\"Your Grace\\", before the Acts of Union of 1707, when Scotland became part of the Kingdom of Great Britain. From then on, British monarchs were addressed as \\"Your Majesty\\".

He has managed Huddersfield Town, Scunthorpe United and Sunderland. Playing career During his playing career, Buxton played in the Football League for both Burnley and Halifax Town, making a total of 53 professional appearances in nine seasons. He was plagued with injuries and broke his tibia twice while playing for Burnley. Coaching career Buxton became Trainer at Halifax Town whilst still playing and coached at Watford, Barnsley, Mansfield Town and Southend United. Managerial career =Huddersfield Town= Buxton initially joined Huddersfield Town in late 1977 from Southend United as the Physiotherapist under manager Tom Johnston. After Johnston's resignation in 1978 Buxton was appointed caretaker manager of Huddersfield Town. He quickly got the job permanently and set about revitalising the Fourth Division club. He installed John Haselden, who was already at the club, as his Assistant Manager and he would also take on the Physio duties. Buxton's first season was the 1978–79 season where Huddersfield finished 9th in the Fourth Division. It was the season after which would prove to be the catalyst for the most successful period of Town's history in the past 10 years. He offloaded the deadwood and brought in players such as Brian Stanton, Mick Laverick and Steve Kindon. He would eventually go on to be one of the most successful managers in the club's recent history, winning promotion to the Third Division at the end of the 1979/80 season where the team scored 101 goals in the league. This team is still loved by the club to this day and have held reunions in 2000, 2010, 2016 and 2017 where the majority of the team and coaching staff still attend. Buxton then took Huddersfield up to the Second Division in 1983. The Terriers would remain in the second tier for five seasons, but Buxton was sacked on 23 December 1986, to be replaced by Steve Smith. Mick Buxton later returned to Town in March 1993 as coach under Ian Ross, and helped the Terriers on one of their best runs in recent history where they only lost once in last eighteen games to avoid relegation. Buxton resigned at the end of the season and Ian Ross soon followed suit. =Scunthorpe United= Scunthorpe United would be Buxton's next managerial appointment. He remained there for four years, with the team occasionally mounting a promotion challenge in this period. He left by mutual consent on 31 January 1991. He returned to Scunthorpe in 1996, but left the following year. =Sunderland= Following the dismissal of Terry Butcher with the side in the relegation zone, Buxton would be appointed Sunderland manager in 1993. A tightening of the team's defence led to an improvement in results and Sunderland finished the 1993-94 season in 12th place. Although a reasonable defensive record was maintained the following season, Sunderland were entangled in a relegation struggle and Buxton would be replaced by Peter Reid.

It is caused by a disorder in serotonin metabolism that causes a deficiency of available serotonin. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Scotty Cramp occurs in puppies and young dogs. Symptoms present after exercise or excitement and last a few minutes. A goose- stepping gait and arched spine are often seen, and the dog may turn somersaults as it runs. The symptoms usually resolve after ten minutes, but they may repeat several times in a day. If the diagnosis is unsure, a dose of methysergide can be given. In affected dogs, this will block serotonin and increase the frequence and severity of the symptoms. Diazepam or acepromazine is used to control the symptoms of Scotty Cramp. Vitamin E may also be of some benefit. Because Scotty Cramp is inherited, affected dogs and their parents and siblings should not be bred.

It is most common in West Highland White Terriers, Maltese, Bichons, and Poodles, and other small dogs. There is a sudden onset of the disease at one to two years of age. It is more likely to occur, and the symptom is worse during times of stress. Nystagmus, difficulty walking, and seizures may occur in some dogs. The cause is unknown, but it may be mediated by the immune system. One theory is that there is an autoimmune-induced generalized deficiency of neurotransmitters. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis may reveal an increased number of lymphocytes. Treatment with corticosteroids may put the dog into remission, or diazepam may control the symptoms. Typically the two drugs are used together. There is a good prognosis, and symptoms usually resolve with treatment within a week, although lifelong treatment may be necessary.

It is not closely related to any other family of flowering plants, and is among the early-diverging lineages in the angiosperms. They are woody or weakly woody plants occurring in Southeast Asia, the Pacific, Madagascar, Central and South America, and the West Indies. The family consists of four extant genera, totalling about 77 known species according to Christenhusz and Byng in 2016. Some species are used in traditional medicine. The type genus is Chloranthus.  Description  Chloranthaceae are fragrant shrubs or herbaceous plants, that only produce side branches on the new growth. The stems are mostly cylindrical, with solid internodes, thickened nodes in many species, that carry evergreen leaves arranged in pairs on opposite sides of the stem, with stipules that have merged with that of the opposing leaf. The small flowers are seated directly on the axis of the inflorescence. Petals are absent in this family, and sometimes so are sepals. The flowers can be either hermaphrodite or of separate sexes. The fruit is drupe or berry, consisting of one carpel. = Differences between the genera = The four genera assigned to this family can be distinguished from each other by the following characters. Sarcandra species are shrubs with wood without vessels, that have bisexual flowers, with only one, club-shaped stamen in which the connective tissue (between the lobes which carry the pollen) is wide, and with a smooth and moist stigma. This genus has four species which occur in Malaysia, China, Indochina, Japan, India, and Sri Lanka. Chloranthus species are dwarf shrubs or herbaceous plants, with xylem that does contain vessels, that has bisexual flowers, each of which containing three stamens on straight, filaments with three lobes and a wide connective, and with a smooth and moist stigma. The twenty species occur in southern and eastern Asia. Ascarina has separate male and female flowers. The male flowers are subtended by two bracts and have between one and five stamens, in which the connective is not widened. The female flower is without bracts, the stigma is dry and covered in papillae. The fruit is a drupe-like berry. Twelve species can be found on islands in the Pacific and insular South-East Asia, from New Zealand and the Marquesas to Borneo, and on Madagascar. Hedyosmum has separate male and female flowers. The male flowers are without bracts and has one stamen in which the connective is not widened. The female flower is without bracts, the stigma is dry and covered in papillae. Female flowers have a trilobed calyx. The fruit has a kernel with a hard and woody shell (a drupe). Forty three species are known from Latin America, including the Antilles, and one species lives in Southeast Asia. Taxonomy Chloranthaceae have been recognised as a family in most classifications but without clear relatives. Molecular systematic studies have shown that it is not closely related to any other family and is among the early-diverging lineages in the angiosperms. In particular, it is neither a eudicot nor a monocot. Fossils assigned to Chloranthaceae, or closely related to the family, are among the oldest angiosperms known. The APG II system (2003) left the family unplaced as to order, but the APG III system (2009) accepted Chloranthales, containing only this family. The cladogram below, from the APG IV system (2016), shows the Chloranthales in a trichotomy with the magnoliids and the monocot-Ceratophyllales-dicot clade. Earlier the order was grouped with magnoliids, but studies in 2014 did not support this placement, so that its phylogeny remains unclear. A study based on comparison of homologous DNA-fragments, published in 2004 indicated that the both the family Chloranthaceae and its extant genera Ascarina, Chloranthus, Hedyosmum and Sarcandra are probably monophyletic, with Hedyosmum being the first to diverge from the rest, and Ascarina being the sister group of the clade consisting of Sarcandra and Chloranthus. , four extant genera are recognized, and insights in their relationships are expressed in the following tree. The extinct genus Chloranthistemon also belongs to this family. =Historical classifications= The Cronquist system (1981) assigned the family : to the order Piperales :: in subclass Magnoliidae ::: in class Magnoliopsida [=dicotyledons] :::: of division Magnoliophyta [=angiosperms]. The Thorne system (1992) placed it : in the order Magnoliales, which was assigned :: to superorder Magnolianae ::: in subclass Magnoliideae [=dicotyledons], :::: in class Magnoliopsida [=angiosperms]. The Dahlgren system raised the family to be : its own order Chloranthales, which was assigned :: to superorder Magnolianae ::: in subclass Magnoliideae [=dicotyledons], :::: in class Magnoliopsida [=angiosperms].

The game was released in Europe and North America in February, and in Japan in March. The plot is a fictionalized version of the assassination of Julius Caesar, focusing on two characters, Agrippa, a soldier whose father is accused of murdering Caesar, and who is forced to fight in the gladiatorial arenas, and Octavianus, who sets about proving Agrippa's father's innocence. The game received favorable reviews. Originally conceived as the first part of a franchise aimed at a specifically western audience, the sequel was in the early stages of development when the first game was released. However, due to poor sales, particularly in North America, executive producer Keiji Inafune decided to scrap the franchise, and Shadow of Rome 2 ultimately became Dead Rising. Gameplay Shadow of Rome is a hack and slash/stealth game played from a third-person perspective. The hack and slash parts of the game involve close quarters combat with weapons, and vehicular combat elements in the form of chariot racing. The stealth portions of the game involve basic stealth gameplay and some rudimentary puzzle-solving. During combat, the player character is Agrippa, who can use various gladiatorial weapons such as swords, scimitars, maces, spears, bows, slingshots and flails. If Agrippa has severed the arm of an enemy, he can pick it up and also use it as a weapon. However, weapons can only be used for a certain amount of time before they break. During combat, a meter indicates the remaining vitality of Agrippa's weapon(s) and helmet (if he has one equipped). Agrippa can attack with his main weapon, his sub-weapon or shield, or with a two-handed weapon. The player can lock on to enemies to make Agrippa target them. Agrippa can also throw weapons at his enemies, and can fight with his fists, using strong and soft punches as well as shoulder tackles. If timed correctly, Agrippa can also steal weapons from his enemies, or knock their weapons out of their hands using a shoulder tackle. He can also attack from the ground by flinging sand into an approaching enemy's face, and he can attack downed enemies by stomping on them or stabbing them. If Agrippa stands behind a groggy enemy he can perform a suplex on them. Combat in Shadow of Rome. Agrippa has just cut both of his opponent's arms off, earning the \\"Disarmed\\" salvo. His salvo meter is on the bottom right of the screen. An important aspect of the combat gameplay are \\"SALVO points.\\" Salvos are specific actions or combinations of actions which excite the crowd. When Agrippa performs a salvo action, he is awarded salvo points, which fill up the salvo bar. If Agrippa calls for the attention of the crowd when the bar is full, the audience will throw him rare and powerful weapons. If he calls for their attention when it is not full, they will throw normal weapons, shields, food, or often, nothing at all. At the end of each arena battle, Agrippa will be given a ranking based on the total amount of salvo points he achieved in that battle. The other component of Agrippa's sections in the game involves chariot racing. In this mode, Agrippa must race against other chariots, and can win by either crossing the finish line first, or eliminating all of his opponents, either by killing them or destroying their chariots. Agrippa can whip his horses to give a speed boost, but doing so drains the horses stamina gauge. When it is empty, the horses can only run at normal speed, until the gauge begins to fill up again. Agrippa can eliminate opponents by driving alongside their chariots and attacking them or by forcing their chariots into obstacles. Longer weapons can be found on the track itself, carried by slaves. In Octavianus' stealth levels, the player must use stealth to navigate various locations in Rome. Octavianus cannot kill enemies, he can only knock them out by hitting them from behind with objects such as vases, choking them with ropes or placing banana peels in front of them. Once he has done so, he often has to drag their body into hiding to make sure other enemies don't find it. Other ways to avoid enemies are by hiding in large pots, or by stealing clothes and impersonating guards or other people. During these levels, there is an alert gauge which appears when Octavianus is spotted by an enemy. The gauge gradually empties over time if he is out of sight, and once it is completely empty, enemies stop looking for him. Octavianus can also distract enemies by throwing items such as stones and by whistling. Even if Octavianus is disguised, enemies can become suspicious of him if he does anything unusual, such as running, standing still for no reason, or trying to open locked doors. Often, enemies will stop him and question him. The player will be presented with a series of choices to try to assuage the guards' suspicions. If the player picks the wrong answer, Octavianus' disguise will fail, and he will be killed. Octavianus is also able to listen to conversations in locked rooms by peeking through keyholes. During levels where he must follow someone, he has a \\"Tail Gauge.\\" When the person he is following is out of his sight, the gauge starts to empty, and when it is fully depleted he is adjudged to have lost the person he was tailing and the game is over. Plot The game begins as the Roman army, under the command of centurion Agrippa (voiced by Rick Weiss), is fighting a Germanic army in the northeastern provinces. In Rome, Julius Caesar (Michael Bell) is on his way to the Senate when he is stabbed. As he dies, he looks at his killer and says \\"Et tu, Brute?\\" As he is cremated in the Foro Romano, Cicero (Peter Renaday) reveals the assassin to the public; Vipsanius (Daniel Riordan), Agrippa's father. As Vipsanius maintains his innocence, Cicero announces Caesar's successor, Antonius (Chris Cox). Listening from the crowd, Octavianus (Scott Menville), Caesar's nephew, refuses to believe Vipsanius is guilty. Meanwhile, in Germania, Agrippa receives word of Caesar's death, and orders his men to return to Rome. Soon after the funeral, Octavianus meets Pansa (Jack Angel), formerly Caesar's most trusted spy. With Pansa's help, Octavianus sneaks into the Senate where Maecenas (Larry Cedar), Antonius' secretary, proposes that rather than immediately executing Vipsanius, they hold a gladiatorial tournament across the Empire, the winner of which will perform the execution. Antonius approves of the idea, but dictates that Vipsania (Moira Quirk), Vipsanius' wife, be publicly executed immediately. Agrippa arrives back in Rome, and Octavianus explains the situation. At the execution, presided over by Decius Brutus (Daniel Riordan), Agrippa attempts to save Vipsania, but as they flee, she is stabbed in the back by Decius, who then defeats Agrippa in combat. However, before Agrippa can be arrested, he and Octavianus are saved by a woman on a chariot. She reveals her name is Claudia (Nicole Balick), a female gladiator. She tells them about the gladiatorial tournament, and that her brother, Sextus (Roger Rose) runs a gladiator camp which Agrippa could join to gain entry to the tournament and possibly save his father. Meanwhile, Octavianus will remain in Rome and investigate the murder. As Agrippa fights his way through the tournament, Octavianus begins to follow Cicero's protégé, Marcus Brutus (Cam Clarke). At the camp, Claudia tells Agrippa she and Sextus are not brother and sister; he rescued her as a child after her brother was killed by a Roman soldier. Meanwhile, Sextus is visited by Iris (Heather Halley) and Charmian (Jennifer Hale), who come with \\"a direct order from our mistress.\\" They want Sextus to assassinate someone, in return for their mistress aiding his plans. Sextus agrees. In Rome, Octavianus finds Cicero stabbed in his office. The dying Cicero tells him a group of conspirators are responsible for Caesar's assassination, and Vipsanius is innocent. Marcus is a member of the group, but the actual murderer is \\"another Brutus.\\" Meanwhile, Agrippa makes it to the finals of the tournament in the Colosseum. Octavianus heads to meet Marcus, where he finds multiple senators murdered, and a distraught Marcus, who says the other Brutus is killing off the members of the conspiracy. However, he refuses to reveal his identity. At the camp, Claudia tells Agrippa Sextus is really the son of Pompeius, who was killed in battle by Caesar. She explains he plans to assassinate Octavianus (Caesar's only surviving blood relative) in order to gain support for his conquest of Rome. Meanwhile, Octavianus finds a note in Caesar's handwriting speculating as to the worthiness of possible successors, and learns that Antonius was not his chosen heir. At the camp, Sextus abruptly disappears along with a number of gladiators, and Claudia learns he is working for Iris and Charmian. In Rome, Sextus confronts Octavianus, and is about to kill him when Claudia intervenes. Octavianus flees, and witnesses Decius stabbing Marcus. A dying Marcus tells Octavianus that Decius is the \\"other Brutus.\\" Maecenas then has Octavianus arrested. In the final of the tournament, Agrippa faces Decius, whom he defeats and is about to kill him when Maecenas arrives in the arena, announcing the return of Caesar. He explains the man killed was a decoy employed because Caesar knew about the conspiracy, announcing the murder was carried out by Decius, not Vipsanius. Caesar arrives and addresses Antonius, telling him he did not chose him as his heir. Iris and Charmian revealed Caesar's true choice to Antonius, who masterminded the conspiracy. A shocked Antonius admits his guilt, at which point Maecenas reveals Caesar really is dead, and the man pretending to be him is his true chosen heir - Octavianus. A furious Antonius orders Decius to kill Octavianus, but Agrippa intervenes and kills Decius. At that moment, however, Rome is attacked by Sextus, supported by soldiers loyal to Antonius, who is able to escape the arena. Agrippa and Claudia head to Ostia and confront Sextus. Agrippa defeats him and begs him to surrender. However, Antonius attacks the docks, and Sextus sacrifices himself to save Claudia. As a battle rages at sea between those loyal to Octavianus and those loyal to Antonius, Agrippa faces Antonius, whom he defeats and kills. Back in Rome, Agrippa, Octavianus and Claudia mourn Sextus. She tells them she is leaving Rome, but will keep her eye on things. As she leaves, Agrippa asks her to promise she will return, but she doesn't answer him. Octavianus then vows to fulfill Caesar's dream of the Pax Romana, with Agrippa vowing to help him any way he can. In the epilogue, a content Iris and Charmian state it is time to tell their mistress they have \\"reached the end of the beginning.\\" Development Shadow of Rome was first revealed on January 28, 2004 when Capcom announced the plot would revolve around the assassination of Julius Caesar. Using an enhanced version of the Onimusha 3 game engine, and developed by the same team, under the guidance of executive producer Keiji Inafune, the game was announced as exclusive to the PlayStation 2. Capcom explained it would have two parallel stories and two different styles of gameplay; action and stealth. In his first look at the game, GameSpot's Ricardo Torres wrote At this stage in development, the game featured a semi- branching storyline, whereby if the player excelled at the stealth sections, there would be more levels based around stealth, whereas if they were good at combat, more combat levels would feature. The game was next shown at the E3 event in May, where a playable demo was made available, with one Agrippa level and one Octavianus level. Capcom explained the game was specifically designed for North American and European markets, and although release dates for both markets had been set, they were unsure if the game would get a release in Japan as it was not tailored for the Japanese market. The game was next shown at the Tokyo Game Show in September. A near complete build was sent to gaming websites in January 2005, when it was revealed the branching system had been removed and the game now followed a linear level-by-level progression system. Reception Shadow of Rome received \\"generally favourable reviews.\\" It holds an aggregate score of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on fifty-two reviews. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored the game 6 out of 10, calling it \\"one of those frustrating 'nearly' games that could and should have been brilliant.\\" He praised the concept of mixing two gameplay styles; \\"it would be easy to get stuck in a rut as a gaming experience if you were constantly engaged in a blistering hack-and-slash the whole time. Likewise, a pure stealth experience would soon feel restrictive and frustrating.\\" However, he felt the stealth sections were underdeveloped, arguing \\"they're just never that enjoyable on a basic level,\\" and calling them \\"tedious, exacting, basic and inconsistent.\\" However, he was also critical of the action sections, calling them \\"blister inducing,\\" and arguing \\"the same tactics get you through every time.\\" He ultimately concluded \\"there's something oddly soulless about [the game].\\" Game Revolution's Joe Dodson scored the game a C, arguing the mixing of gameplay styles was poorly executed; \\"Most games include stealth and action mechanics so that the player can choose how to approach a situation, but in Shadow of Rome, Octavianus cannot fight at all and Agrippa is about as stealthy as a hippo on PCP.\\" He also found the combat system shallow; \\"Agrippa's gameplay heavily relies on the X button. There are all sorts of special names for the crazy stuff he can do, but most of it requires one button press.\\" He concluded, \\"despite its grandiose subject matter, Shadow of Rome is merely a bad stealth game chained to a limited action game.\\" GameSpy's Bryn Williams scored the game 3.5 out of 5, writing it \\"oozes potential but ultimately fails to deliver greatness.\\" He called the stealth levels \\"distinctly bland, and above all else, poorly designed.\\" He was also critical of the voice acting and the cutscenes, and concluded \\"the overall theme and premise of Shadow of Rome ends up coming across as a missed opportunity for gaming greatness. The pacing is thrown out of whack on a regular basis due to the crippled stealth elements.\\" IGN's Ed Lewis scored it 7.6 out of 10, calling the action sections \\"pretty damn satisfying.\\" However, although he didn't dislike the stealth sections, he felt \\"neither side of the game [...] is complex enough or [has] enough detail to make them something to want to dig into.\\" He concluded, \\"put both these elements of the game together and the result is the equivalent of a summer action flick with a decent plot.\\" GameSpot's Greg Kasavin scored the game 8.2 out of 10, praising the \\"intriguing storyline and great-looking cinematic cutscenes.\\" He felt it \\"successfully combines two distinctly different types of gameplay [...] Feature for feature, there's nothing hugely original about Shadow of Rome, but its combination of different elements is definitely unique, its characters are expressive and fun to watch, and the quality of its presentation is right up there with the best of what the PlayStation 2 has to offer.\\" He concluded \\"Shadow of Rome offers some of the best hack-and-slash combat out there and wraps it up in an interesting story that puts an original spin on the whole Julius Caesar-getting-murdered thing. It's also got plenty of gameplay variety to keep you motivated from start to finish, and it's always pretty to look at.\\" Cancelled sequels Although originally conceived as the first part of a franchise aimed specifically at Western markets, Shadow of Rome did not sell well in either North America or Europe (entering the UK PlayStation 2 charts at #5), and ultimately, Capcom considered it a failure. Shadow of Rome 2 was already in early development prior to the release of the first game, but after the poor sales, executive producer Keiji Inafune chose to abandon the project, and Shadow of Rome 2 ultimately became Dead Rising.

Its founding on September 14, 1904 under the name Mechanics Arts High School marked the beginning of technical education on the secondary level in the city of Buffalo. The current principal is Gabrielle Morquecho. History Mechanical High Elm Street School c. 1914 Mechanical High First Graduating Class c. 1907The school was first housed in the then Elementary School No. 11 on Elm Street near Clinton Street. Daniel Upton, the founder of the school and its first principal, began operations with a faculty of four teachers and a pupil registration of sixty-four. In September 1905, the school's name was changed to Technical High School, pending the move to a new building to be built on Cedar Street and Clinton Ave; the cornerstone was laid on November 14, 1912. The Cedar Street building opened on July 14, 1918 with an enrollment of 1009 students, 863 boys and 146 girls. It offered evening classes, the first of its kind in Buffalo at the time. The program of studies at Technical High School differed from that of other Buffalo high schools, in its introduction of Industrial Chemistry Machine Design, Engineering College Preparatory, Electrical, Commercial Art and Building Design and Construction to the program of the high school at this point. Technical High School Corner Stone laying and earth breaking c. 1912Technical High School Cedar and Clinton, c. 1914 The school received a charter from the Regents of the State of New York (now the New York State Education Department) under the name Technical High School of Buffalo in 1918, and remained in this building until 1954. In the spring of 1921, Tech began issuing entrance exams and became what is now known as a magnet school, even though with its course load it would normally fall into the classification of a vocational-technical school. That practice still continues today to help select classes, which now consist of roughly 200-300 students. Technical High School building in May 2012. The school was in great demand during its forty years of instruction at this location. Most of Technical High School's equipment was transferred to the building formerly occupied by Hutchinson Central High School. This building, located at South Elmwood Avenue and Chippewa Street, was completely renovated, remodeled and repainted. It is located within the boundaries of the West Village Historic District. Hutch-Tech was one of the world's first high schools with a digital computer, acquiring an IBM 1620 (Level C) in 1961. This computer, with 20,000 BCD words of memory, was quite advanced for the time, and classes were taught in assembly language, symbolic programming, Fortran, COBOL, and numerical analysis. Many Hutch-Tech graduates from the 1960s became pioneers in computing. Perhaps the best known of these is astronomer and computer security expert Clifford Stoll. The curriculum has been revamped and expanded continuously over the second half of the 20th Century, for entrance into schools of engineering and or the training of technicians for entry-level positions in current technical fields. The programs the school now offers includes bio-chemical technology, computer technology, and engineering technology. Instruction in electricity and electronics is also provided. Hutch-Tech also offers a selection of college prep courses including Advanced Placement that both helped their major, and helped them meet their general education requirements that most colleges require. The courses include AP English Language and Composition, AP English Literature and Composition, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Calculus, AP Spanish Language, AP Physics-C, and AP United States History. More recently the building was set for renovation as part of a citywide plan to renovate dozen of schools in the city of Buffalo. The renovation took place from the summer of 2005 until the summer of 2007. The \\"New\\" building has more and updated classrooms with Promethean Ltd smart boards, a brand new gymnasium, new engineering and electrical equipment, and new science rooms. While the building was being renovated, school operations took place at Kensington High School on the city's East Side. David Greco, retired 2010 At the end of the 2010 School Year, David Greco retired after nearly fifteen years of service as head administrator at Hutch-Tech, and nearly twenty-five years as a history teacher, and administrator elsewhere, including Bennett High School, Buffalo Traditional, and others. This is five years later than his original retirement date of 2005, but Greco made a promise to see the renovations through, and see the students back to the building on South Elmwood. Greco's successor was Sabatino Cimato. In November 2015, Sabatino Cimato was appointed to associate superintendent in charge of leadership for Buffalo Public Schools. Dr. Gabrielle Morquecho was named interim principal for the remainder of the school year. In July 2016, Dr. Morquecho was appointed Principal of Hutch- Tech.Principal, Dr. Gabrielle Morquecho = Former principals = Previous assignment and reason for departure denoted in parentheses *Daniel Upton-1904-1909 (Teacher - Mechanic Arts High School, named Principal of State Normal School in Buffalo) *Author S.

Sports teams include: football, basketball, baseball, softball, soccer, hockey, swimming, rowing, golf and Track. The school also features a number of clubs and organizations including: Student Council, Students Against Drunk Driving, GSA (Gay-Straight Alliance), Kappa Sigma Phi, Drama Club, JROTC, Foreign Language Clubs, Engineering Organizations, Drill Team, Cheerleading and a school newspaper club. Staff-led musical instruction supports several musical groups including a jazz ensemble, concert band and marching band. In the news In recognition of its unique programs and past accomplishments, Hutchinson Central Technical High School was honored as a National School of Excellence in 1988-1989 by the U.S. Department of Education. In 1996, Redbook Magazine cited HCTHS as one of the top 150 high schools in the country. In October 2005, the New York Civil Liberties Union successfully pressured the school to release students from their mandatory Junior ROTC program, arguing that the practice violates the State's Education Law, which provides that no child may be enrolled in JROTC without prior written parental consent.NYCLU Pushes Buffalo High School To Release Students From Mandatory JROTC Program. New York Civil Liberties Union, 12 October 2005. In the end, Greco did release the student in question, and all others, but not without the attention of the local media. WGRZ, the local NBC broadcast channel, carried the story, as did the local publication Artvoice. On November 21, 2008, John Hoffmeister, former CEO of Shell Oil in Houston, spoke to the student body about alternative energy, in an event organized by the Buffalo Urban League. Following the theft of a student's bicycle from Hutch Tech in March 2009, the administration announced a policy that in essence banned bike riding to and from the school. The student brought the matter before the Buffalo school board, and the first bike rack at Hutch Tech was installed, contributed by a local bicycling advocacy group. The superintendent of schools expressed a desire and plan for bike racks throughout the Buffalo Public School District. In 2009, Hutchinson Central Technical High School was ranked 86th out of 131 Western New York high schools in terms of academic performance. In the 2011 U.S. News and World Report analysis of United States Best High Schools, Hutch Tech received a Bronze Star for exceeding state performance in its Poverty-Adjusted Performance Index, and greatly exceeding overall state average performance by its disadvantaged students. The school's college readiness score prevented receiving a higher ranking. In the 2013 analysis of United States Best High Schools, Hutch Tech was upgraded to receive a Silver Award for far exceeding state performance in its Poverty-Adjusted Performance Index, exceeding state average performance when not Poverty-Adjusted, as well as an improved college readiness score. On April 4, 2014, Hutchinson Central Technical High School went into lockdown after a bomb threat was posted on Facebook. However, no explosive device was found in the school and after two hours, the lockdown was lifted. The 15-year- old sophomore student that police say posted the threat was arrested.

Calgary Herald, October 3, 2002. The film, about a gay man and a married heterosexual man who fall in love, was filmed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and played the international gay and lesbian film festival circuit throughout 2002 and 2003. Plot David (Troy Ruptash) is a well-known artist who is blocked. He decides to take a job as a waiter to try to find inspiration. His friend and roommate Shannon (Thom Allison), a pre-op male-to- female transsexual, stumbles across the Main St. Diner, owned by Matt (Vince Corazza) and Violet (Cherilee Taylor), who are looking for a waiter. David gets hired and quickly becomes close with the couple although they don't know of his standing in the art community and are surprised to learn that he's gay. David's friend Kryla (Lynda Boyd), a columnist for the Winnipeg Tribune, tracks David down at the diner against his wishes. An annoyed David demands that she write up the diner in her column, which she does. The diner's business picks up considerably. Shannon, whose sex reassignment surgery has been repeatedly delayed because of her HIV-positive status, begins to become ill. David has a painting installed and Kryla gets his photo in the paper. Matt and Violet see the photo and realize that he's famous. David and Matt start hanging out. Matt, who had tried his hand at drawing comic books, pesters David to show him his paintings but David resists. Matt confesses that he had once fallen in love with another man in college although he hadn't acted on it. David, finding himself drawn to Matt, paints him nude (although Matt doesn't pose). He tells Matt that there's a painting he needs to see. Matt comes to David's place and sees the painting. He becomes aroused and the two begin an affair. David paints two more portraits of Matt, who still doesn't actually pose. Kryla and Shannon hail them as his best work and entreat him to exhibit them but Matt, nervous about how Violet would react, makes him promise not to. Each also tells the other that he loves him. They keep the relationship secret, though, especially in the face of the vehement disapproval Kryla expresses to David at the idea of his sleeping with a married man. Kryla soon discovers the affair when she walks in on David and Matt having sex. A panicked Matt tells David that he lied about loving him and flees. In the aftermath of the affair, Shannon convinces David to break his promise and exhibit the paintings. He does so under the title \\"Straightman.\\" When Matt learns of the show he confronts David, first threatening to destroy the paintings and then offering himself again sexually. David contemptuously dismisses him. Matt tells Violet about the paintings and about the affair and admits that he is in love with David. She demands a divorce. Shannon, who has grown progressively more ill, decides to take her life. As she dies, David runs into Kryla at a bar and they have a bitter fight. Violet attends the opening but merely tells David that the paintings are very good. As she's leaving Matt arrives and she refuses to give him another chance. After the opening Matt again approaches David who also rebuffs him. At film's end, Violet sells the Main St. Diner and Matt has left town. David has also decided to leave. He and Kryla reconcile.

Conrad descended from a noble family from Lichtenau in the Duchy of Swabia. He resided for some time at the Imperial court and later at the Papal court in Rome under Innocent III. It was probably there that he became a canon regular, afterwards to enter the Premonstratensian Order. After the death of Provost Burchard of Biberach in 1230 or 1231, Conrad became provost at Ursberg in Bavaria, where he died. For many years, Conrad was believed to be the only author of the Chronicon Urspergense, a chronicle of world history for the time of King Ninus of Assyria to AD 1229. Later it came to be believed that the work was written in several parts by several different people. The first part, which covers the period up to 1125, was written, in part at least, by Ekkehard of Aura; a continuation, from 1126 to 1225, was added by Abbot Burchard of Biberach, who preceded Conrad as Abbot of Ursperg. Conrad himself continued the work to 1229 and made the final redaction. Today, Burchard is seen as the author of the whole.

Tianeti is the administrative center of Municipality of Tianeti, which also comprises the town of Sioni and 43 neighbouring villages (total area – 907 km²; population – 13,400, 2002 est.). It was known as Tionets during the Russian Empire's rule. Tianeti is situated in the North-Eastern part of Georgia (Mtskheta-Mtianeti region). According to the 2014 State Census, its population was 2,479 people. As 2003 studies of poverty in Georgia suggest, Mtskheta-Mtianeti Region, and Tianeti district in particular, are among the poorest regions and districts of Georgia. In 2003, 63% of the population of Tianeti's populace was below the poverty line, compared to 47% of the Georgian population (Labbate, Jamburia, Mirzashvili, 2003: 21). According to the Ministry of Labor, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia, as of November 2008, 14% of Tianeti families were receiving social assistance in December 2008, compared to 8% countrywide. During the Soviet times, Tianeti was a district (‘rayon’) centre. Several food processing enterprises, factories, as well poultry and meat producing farms were functioning in the district, providing employment opportunities for the local population (Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia 1979: 678-679). Soviet cultural, medical and educational infrastructure was also developed there. In 2008, Tianeti was still the centre of the municipality (which is the contemporary analogue to Soviet-era term ‘rayon’) with two secondary schools, two kindergartens, a vocational school, library, hospital and ethnographic museum. A municipal governance office, post office, and police station are also located in Tianeti. One of the Georgian banks has an office in Tianeti. There is a farmer's market, where most of the population purchases food, and several private grocery stores. None of the factories and farms that operated during the Soviet time are working today, and no new enterprises have been established. A small part of the population works at state institutions (so called “budget jobs”: schools, hospital, local self-governance, post-office, etc.). Products and/or income from subsistence farming contribute to a significant share of the local economy. However, Tianeti has a shortage of arable land (Labbate, Jamburia, Mirzashvili, 2003:21). In addition, the climate is quite severe, thus sometimes the population is unable to harvest crops before the winter. Adapted from forthcoming: Tamar Zurabishvili, Tinatin Zurabishvili. 2012.

During the Battle of Queenston Heights in the War of 1812, Vrooman's Point was the home of a vital British twenty-four-pounder artillery piece. Despite being near the limits of its range trying to bombard the battle, the piece harassed American troops on the American shore trying to embark their boats for Canada and the battle, as well as providing support for the British recapture of the heights. The cannon was commanded by Captain Samuel Hatt of the Upper Canadian militia and Lieutenant John Ball. Today, the point is home to a monument commemorating its role in the battle.

It is directly across from the Red Fort in the historical Chandni Chowk area. The temple is known for an avian veterinary hospital, called the Jain Birds Hospital, in a second building behind the main temple. Located just opposite the massive Red Fort at the intersection of Netaji Subhas Marg and Chandni Chowk, Digambar Jain Temple is the oldest Jain temple in the capital. According to Jain scholar Balbhadra Jain's compendium of Digambar Jain shrines in India, it was built in 1656.  History  Old Delhi was founded by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan (1628–1658) who built what is commonly known as the old city or walled city, surrounded by a wall, with the main street Chandni Chowk in front of the Red Fort, the imperial residence. Shah Jahan invited several Agrawal Jain merchantsIndia's Agrawal community: Its history and prominent personalities to come and settle in the city and granted them some land south of the Chandani Chowk around Dariba Gali. According to Jain scholar Balbhadra Jain's compendium of Digambar Jain shrines in India, the temple was constructed during the reign of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Balbhadra Jain states that a Jain officer of the Mughal army is said to have kept a tirthankara statue in his tent for personal worship. The tent gradually started attracting other Jain army officers, and subsequently, a Jain temple was constructed at the site in 1656. At that time, the temple was also known as \\"Urdu temple\\" (because it was located in an area called \\"Urdu Bazaar\\") and \\"Lashkari Mandir\\" (laskhar means an army camp). Balbhadra Jain also mentions that there are several legends about the temple. One such legend claims that Shah Jahan's successor Aurangzeb once ordered a ban on all musical instruments in the temple. However, miraculously, sounds of drums (nagadas) would be heard emanating from the temple despite inspections from the Mughal officers. Aurganzeb himself visited the temple to see the miracle, and finally, lifted the ban. The present-day temple buildings were constructed after the fall of the Mughal Empire, and date from 1878. Balbhadra Jain states that one of the idols in the temple dates back to 1491, and was originally installed by Bhattaraka Jinachandra. The Agrawal Jain community acquired three marble idols installed by Jivaraj Papriwal under the supervision of Bhattaraka Jinachandra in Samvat 1548 (1491 AD) for the temple. The main icon is that of Tirthankara Parshva. It is said that the deities in temple were originally kept in a tent belonging to an Agrawal Jain officer of the Mughal army. Other nearby temples include the Gauri Shankar temple and the Naya Mandir. The Gauri Shankar temple was built next to the Lal Mandir in 1761 by Appa Gangadhara, a Maratha Brahman in the service of the Scindia when Delhi was under their influence. It also has been significantly rebuilt in the past few decades. In 1800-1807, Raja Harsukh Rai, the imperial treasurer obtained imperial permission to build a temple with a shikhara in the Agrawal Jain neighborhood of Dharamapura, just south of Chandani Chauk. Thus temple, known for fine carvings, is now known as the Naya Mandir \\"New Temple\\".  The Temple complex  Manasthamba in front of the temple A manastambha column stands in front of the temple. The main devotional area of the temple is on the first floor. It is reached by ascending to the terrace after crossing the small courtyard of the temple, surrounded by a colonnade. There are a number of shrines in this area but the main shrine is of Lord Mahavira, the 24th and last Tirthankara of the present Avasarpani era (half time cycle of decreasing happiness as per Jain cosmology). Born in 599 BC in the ancient republic of Vaishali (Bihar) as a prince, he renounced all worldly pleasures and comforts and went in search of 'Moksha' (salvation). Soon he attained Kevala Jnana (Enlightenment), and spent the rest of his life preaching to the people all over the country about the eternal truth of life and ways to attain Moksha. Though some believe that he was the founder of Jainism but he was in a real sense the reformer of an existing faith who reorganized and presented the tenets of the religion in a form suitable to the period. The statue of Rishabhanatha, the first Tirthankara is also present here, along with the shrine of Lord Parshvanath, the immediate predecessor of Lord Mahavira. The temple is popular among the Jains. The place is very peaceful and the ambience is really soothing especially due to the shining of the gilded paintwork of the shrine area under the lights of butter lamps and candles. In 1931, Acharya Shantisagar, a Digambara Jain monk arrived in Delhi. He was the first Digambara monk to visit Delhi after a gap of eight centuries. There is a memorial marking this historical occasion. Birds Hospital at Śrī Digambar Jain Lāl Mandir The temple compound has a famous Bird Hospital.

Under pressure from the United States government, the Brothertown Indians, together with the Stockbridge-Munsee and some Oneida, removed to Wisconsin in the 1830s, taking ships through the Great Lakes. In 1839 they were the first tribe of Native Americans in the United States to accept United States citizenship and allotment of their communal land to individual households, in order to prevent another removal further west. Most of the neighboring Oneida and many of the Lenape (Delaware) were removed to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) in this period. Seeking to regain federal recognition, the Brothertown Indians filed a documented petition in 2005. The Bureau of Indian Affairs notified the tribe in 2009 in a preliminary finding that they had not satisfied all seven criteria. In addition, the BIA said that the 1839 act granting the Brothertown United States citizenship and dissolving their communal reservation land, had effectively terminated the people as a sovereign tribe. In September 2012, in the final determination on the Brothertown petition, the acting Assistant Secretary determined that the group previously had a relationship with the United States, but had its tribal status terminated by the 1839 act which could only be restored by a new act of Congress. Because Brothertown could not satisfy one of the seven mandatory criteria for federal acknowledgment, the Department did not look to the other criteria in making its final determination. The Brothertown Indians are continuing to pursue federal recognition. The Brothertown Indians are one of twelve tribes residing in Wisconsin and the only one that does not have federal recognition. The tribe is estimated to have more than 4,000 members as of 2013. History =Tribe forms in New England= The Reverend Samson Occom, founder of the Brothertown Indian Nation The Brothertown Indian Nation (Eeyawquittoowauconnuck) was formed by three leaders of the Mohegan and Pequot tribes of New England and eastern Long Island: Samson Occom (Mohegan/Brothertown), a notable Presbyterian minister to New England Indians and fundraiser for Moor's Indian Charity School—although funds Occom raised for this school were used by Wheelock to found Dartmouth College;Samson Occom Letters, Dartmouth College Library his son-in-law Joseph Johnson (Mohegan), who was a messenger for General George Washington during the American Revolution; and Occom's brother- in-law David Fowler (Montauk, Pequot). They organized as a new tribe the numerous remnant peoples who had survived the disruption of disease, colonialism and warfare,Thomas Commuck, \\"Sketch of the Brothertown Indians\\" (1859), Wisconsin Historical Collections including some Narragansett and Montauk. After the American Revolutionary War, the tribe formally organized on November 7, 1785 and included members of the so-called Christian tribes of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Long Island, New York. These included people of Mohegan, Pequot at Groton, Connecticut; Pequot at Stonington, Connecticut; Narragansett, Niantic, and Tunxis (Farmington) tribes on New England, and the Montauk (also a Pequot band) of Long Island though other members of these communities chose to remain as intact Nations. Under pressure from the victorious American settlers to move west, they began to migrate in the 1780s to land provided to them by the Oneida Nation of the Iroquois in Marshall, New York (near Waterville, in Oneida County), where they formalized their new status. As allies to the Patriots, the Oneida were allowed to stay in New York on a small reservation. Due to hostilities aroused by four of the Iroquois nations having allied with the British during the war, and continuing land hunger by new settlers, New York and the United States governments pressured the tribes to remove west of the Mississippi River. By the 1830s, the Brothertown Indian Nation sold its land to the state of New York and purchased land in Wisconsin. The 3200-member tribe thrives in twenty- first century America.\\"Brothertown Indians\\", Wisconsin History =Treaties to move west= In 1818 members of the Brothertown Indian tribe, Isaac Wobby and Jacob Dick, were granted reservations in what is now Delaware County, Indiana by the Treaty with the Delawares made at St. Mary's. They were accompanied to the treaty negotiations by Thomas Dean, a manager of Indian affairs in Oneida County, New York. Dean was attempting to resettle the Brothertown Indians on lands where their presence would be tolerated. However, these reservations were soon owned by Goldsmith Gilbert, business man who founded Muncie, Indiana. In 1821, numerous New York tribes signed a treaty with the federal government and acquired in Wisconsin. In 1822, another delegation acquired an additional , which consisted of almost the entire western shore of Lake Michigan. The Brothertown Indians were to receive about along the southeastern side of the Fox River near present-day Kaukauna and Wrightstown. Some of the other tribes included in the 1821 treaty felt they were misled by the federal government. The treaty was hotly debated for eight years, and was never ratified by the United States Senate. The federal government mediated a settlement with three treaties signed in 1831 and 1832. The settlement with the Brothertown consisted of exchanging the formerly agreed-upon lands for the now referred to as the entire town of Brothertown in Calumet County along the east shore of Lake Winnebago. =Tribe moves west to Wisconsin= The Brothertown leadership led the move west so they could live in peace away from European-American influences. The Brothertown joined their neighbors, some of the Oneida tribe and the Stockbridge-Munsee, in planning the move to Wisconsin. Five groups of Brothertown people arrived in Wisconsin on ships at the port of Green Bay between 1831 and 1836, after having traveled across the Great Lakes. Upon arrival, the Brothertown cleared their communal land and began farming, after building a church near Jericho. They also created a settlement called Eeyawquittoowauconnuck, which they later renamed as Brothertown. Finding that their land was fertile, the federal government soon proposed to move the Brothertown west to Indian Territory in present-day Kansas, as authorized under the Indian Removal Act. In 1834, the Brothertown Indian Nation requested U.S. citizenship and allotment of land by individual title to tribal members (the land had been considered tribal property) in order to avoid being forced to move west again. On March 3, 1839, Congress passed an act granting the Brothertown Indians U.S. citizenship, making them the first Indians to acquire it formally. One member, William Fowler served in the Territorial Legislative Assembly of the Wisconsin Territory; two others, Alonzo Dick and William H. Dick, served in the Wisconsin State Assembly, the first non-whites to do so. Several tribal members held office in Calumet County, even after the Brothertown ceased to be a majority in that county. Although William H. Dick was elected to the State legislature again in 1871, after that year Brothertown Indians were active in politics only at the local civil township level. The tribe did not give up their sovereignty for citizenship. The Bureau of Indian Affairs has repeatedly confirmed that U.S. citizenship and sovereignty are not mutually exclusive. All Native Americans are now U.S. citizens, yet the federal government has acknowledged approximately 573 tribes. In 1878, the federal government met with the Brothertown leaders. It proposed that the tribe should release land in the former reservation that had not been allocated to individual households; the federal government intended to sell it to German immigrants settling in Wisconsin.INDIAN AFFAIRS: LAWS AND TREATIES , Compiled and edited by Charles J. Kappler. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1904, available online at Digital Library, Oklahoma State University. Retrieved January 4, 2007 Federal recognition status =Termination policy= As part of the Indian termination policy that the US government adopted in the late 1940s and applied into the 1960s, it identified several former New York tribes for termination, with the thought they no longer needed a special relationship with the federal government. A January 21, 1954 memo by the Department of the Interior advised that a bill for termination was being prepared including \\"about 3,600 members of the Oneida Tribe residing in Wisconsin. Another memo of the Department of the Interior memo, entitled \\"Indian Claims Commission Awards Over $38.5 Million to Indian Tribes in 1964,\\" states that the Emigrant Indians of New York are \\"(now known as the Oneidas, Stockbridge-Munsee, and Brotherton Indians of Wisconsin)\\". In an effort to fight termination and force the government into recognizing their outstanding land claims from New York, the three tribes began filing litigation in the 1950s.http://www.iwantthenews.com/main.asp?Search=1&ArticleID;=21652&SectionID;=1&SubSectionID;=74&S;=1 As a result of a claim filed with the Indian Claims Commission, the group was awarded a settlement of $1,313,472.65 on August 11, 1964. To distribute the funds, Congress passed Public Law 90-93 81 Stat. 229 Emigrant New York Indians of Wisconsin Judgment Act, and prepared separate rolls of persons in each of the three groups to determine which tribal members had at least one-quarter \\"Emigrant New York Indian blood.\\" It directed tribal governing bodies of the Oneida and Stockbridge-Munsee to apply to the Secretary of the Interior for approval of fund distributions, thereby ending termination efforts for these tribes. With regard to the Brothertown Indians, however, though the law did not specifically state they were terminated, it authorized all payments to be made directly to each enrollee, with special provisions for minors to be handled by the Secretary, though the payments were not subject to state or federal taxes. Part of the settlement required each of the tribes to update their membership rolls. =Restoration= Union Cemetery, in the town of Brothertown, Wisconsin In 1978, the federal government developed guidelines for tribes who lost recognition under the termination policy in order to allow them to regain federal recognition. The Brothertown submitted its first petition of intent that year to gain federal recognition as a tribe, in order to be able to provide for people who live away from their small reservation, as well as to have status among federally recognized tribes.. They want to establish historical records for their people as well. They contend they have maintained cultural identity and continuity, as well as political government. In 1993 the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) acknowledged that the Brothertown Indians had been recognized as a sovereign tribe by the federal government in provisos to treaties of 1831 and 1832, and in the 1839 act granting them citizenship and allocation of lands in Wisconsin. The Office of the Solicitor of the Department of Interior confirmed in writing to the tribe that the Brothertown Indian Nation was eligible to petition the BIA for federal recognition, a process that the tribe has been pursuing. Had Congress's granting of citizenship status stripped the Brothertown Indian Nation of its federal acknowledgment in 1839, the tribe would have been deemed ineligible for the BIA's federal acknowledgment process (25 CFR sec. 83), and only an act of Congress could give the tribe federal acknowledgment..\\"Brothertown Indians\\" , Federal Reporter, September 18, 2008 Based on the BIA's ruling, the Brothertown Indians spent several years compiling the data required to petition for federal recognition from the Department of Interior's BIA and submitted a detailed petition in 2005. In 2009, the Brothertown Indians were notified by the BIA of the preliminary finding that they did not satisfy five of the seven criteria for recognition.. More importantly, the BIA reinterpreted its 1993 policy memo, and said in a press release that the tribe lost its federal status by the 1839 Congressional act: In September 2012, in the final determination on the Brothertown petition, the acting Assistant Secretary determined that the group previously had a relationship with the United States, but had its tribal status terminated by an 1839 Act of Congress. Because Brothertown could not satisfy one of the seven mandatory criteria for federal acknowledgment, the Department did not look to the other criteria in making its final determination. The acting Assistant Secretary noted that only Congress may restore the tribal status of Brothertown and thus its government-to-government relationship with the United States. The Brothertown Council and Recognition/Restoration committee have developed a strategic plan to lobby politicians from the local town level up through Congress to regain tribal status. In an ongoing effort to regain recognition, the tribe asked the Town Board of Brothertown, Wisconsin for support. In a vote held on December 27, 2013, the town refused to endorse a plan to seek Congressional approval. Governance Enrolled members of the Brothertown Indian Nation elect tribal officers, and its tribal council meets monthly. They have bought back a small portion of their former reservation in Wisconsin and function with some degree of self-government in the state of Wisconsin. As individual Native Americans, members who satisfy federal blood quantum rules have certain rights and may gain some federal assistance, such as scholarships available to some Native Americans. The lack of federal recognition reduces their access to certain programs. Culture Community center in Fond du Lac The Brothertown remain a culturally distinct Indian community, with the largest concentration residing in the Fond du Lac, Wisconsin area. In 1999 the nation had about 2400 enrolled members.\\"Brothertown Archeological Project\\", Craig Cipolla website Tribe councilwoman Dr. Faith Ottery estimates that, as of 2013, there are approximately 4000 members enrolled in the tribe. She estimated about 1,800 reside in Wisconsin with 50% within of the original reservation and about 80% within about . Some tribe members own land within the 1842–45 original reservation boundaries. Brothertown members hold a picnic every July and a homecoming every October. Many Brothertown Indians have been buried at Union Cemetery in the town of Brothertown, and Quinney Cemetery located just outside the former reservation boundary. Many Brothertown return to these grave sites yearly to honor their ancestors and tend to the burial sites. The tribe would like to purchase more land in the original reservation and build a museum. =Archaeological project= In 2007, the Brothertown Indian Nation supported the archaeologist Craig Cipolla of the University of Pennsylvania to begin an archaeological survey and excavation on historic Brothertown sites in Wisconsin. He is conducting outreach to gain community involvement by Brothertown members and local landowners. The goal of the project is to locate, map and explore sites in need of preservation.

He was created by Ron Lim and Ron Marz and first appeared in Silver Surfer vol. 3, #69 (Aug. 1992). Fictional character biography =Origin= Morg served as a herald of Galactus after Galactus' previous herald, Nova, was expelled for sparing suitable but inhabited planets from his hunger. Subsequently, prior to consuming his latest planet, Galactus was confronted by Morg; a court executioner who had betrayed his own race by executing his own people for those that had defeated them. In the presence of the world-devourer, Morg showed no fear; instead exhibiting a respectful defiance. Impressed with Morg's demeanor and wary after losing several heralds to attacks of conscience, Galactus decided to employ this most brutal and remorseless specimen as his latest herald. Morg gladly accepted the task of being Galactus' herald. As a weapon, Morg wields a double-edged battle axe—previously used by him in his executioner duties.Silver Surfer vol. 3 #70 =Galactus' herald= One of Galactus' former heralds, the Silver Surfer, went to meet Nova but instead found out that she had been dismissed and replaced by Morg. After informing the Surfer of this, Galactus told the Surfer to leave; however, the Surfer refused to leave without seeing Nova, resulting in a battle with Morg. After fighting Morg and noticing his heartlessness, the Surfer decided to go find Nova and the rest of Galactus's former heralds and have them join him in another battle against Morg.Silver Surfer vol. 3, #70-71 While seeking reinforcements, the heralds found by the Silver Surfer included Firelord, Nova, Terrax and Air-Walker, whom they had to unearth from his grave and reassemble. During this time, Morg discovered a Well on a planet to which he had led Galactus, and in this well were waters containing \\"mystical power\\". Morg immersed himself in the pool, which enhanced his powers exponentially before he returned to his master and destroying the planet.Silver Surfer vol. 3, #72-74 The assembled heralds confronted Morg together, and Terrax used the fact that they were not able to defeat him to convince the Surfer to instead try to get help from Galactus. While the Surfer was gone, Air-Walker was severely damaged again and Morg killed Nova by blasting her in the back when he was thought to have been beaten. Galactus was not pleased with this, so he removed the Power Cosmic that he had imbued in Morg, leaving him with only the power he'd gained from the pool he'd discovered. In his weakened state, Morg was killed by Terrax. After the battle both Firelord and Air Walker volunteered to work for Galactus in order to gain access to Galactus' technology.Silver Surfer vol. 3, #75 Months later, Galactus resurrected Morg to give him a second chance.Silver Surfer vol. 3 #76-77 Morg then sought his missing axe.Silver Surfer vol. 3 #77-79 Morg went off in search of Terrax to exact vengeance upon him, but in their battle they were ambushed by robots working for the villain Tyrant and were taken captive.Silver Surfer vol. 3 #80 While his fellow captives Silver Surfer, Gladiator, Beta Ray Bill, Jack of Hearts and Ganymede fought back against Tyrant, Morg chose to continue his battle with Terrax, heedless of the threat posed by Tyrant. Tyrant easily defeated his opposition, although the appearance of Galactus disrupted the battle. Morg had been incapacitated in the battle, like all those involved, save for the Surfer. Tyrant stated that everyone there could go free, except for Morg, for no other reason than to spite the world devourer.Silver Surfer vol. 3 #82 Tyrant imprisoned Morg and continued to siphon off his Power Cosmic and store it into his orbs. Eventually Morg escaped and went back to his master Galactus,Cosmic Powers #5 and Silver Surfer Annual #7 and served as herald again for a brief time. In a battle between Galactus and Tyrant,Silver Surfer vol. 3 #109 Morg found the Ultimate Nullifier and used it to melt most of Tyrant's body then betrayed both masters by cutting off his own arm while he tried to escape the final nullification blast (Tyrant's drone attached itself to the Nullifier and Morg's arm thus not allowing Morg to separate himself from the Nullifier). His escape failed and the Nullifier exploded, destroying Galactus' ship and all aboard.Silver Surfer vol 3 #109 Annihilus later attempts to retrieve the Power Cosmic from Morg's corpse, but fails.Annihilation: Silver Surfer Powers and abilities Morg was imbued with the Power Cosmic by Galactus, as he did with all his heralds. The physical transformation by the cosmic power of Galactus allowed Morg to fly through space and granted him exponentially enhanced superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes. Morg can manipulate cosmic energy for various effects, including the projection of energy bolts of cosmic force, the augmentation of his strength to even greater superhuman levels, and survive unprotected in the vacuum of outer space without the need of oxygen, food or sleep. Morg carried a double-bladed cosmic axe with a handle, able to emanate waves of destructive force sufficiently powerful to rend a tear in Galactus's ship and to create highly impervious force shields. The mystical pool, the Well of Life, that Morg immersed himself in augmented each of these abilities further,Silver Surfer vol. 3 #72-#73 making him more powerful than any other single herald, even more so than the Silver Surfer. It is unknown whether this still holds true after the events of Annihilation Wave, when Silver Surfer was empowered further by Galactus.Annihilation: Silver Surfer #1-#4 Morg was also an experienced fighter and executioner. In other media = Television = Morg was to have appeared in the second season of the Silver Surfer animated series. His appearance was in the episode \\"Soul Hunter, Part 1\\".

Voodoo is now considered a classic album in the contemporary R&B; genre and paved the way for the neo soul movement. Elevado's \\"old school\\" engineering techniques and preference for using mostly vintage equipment gave the album a sound reminiscent of classic soul or funk records fused with hip-hop textures and psychedelic treatments heard on classic 1960s and 1970s rock records. In 2009, he received a Grammy nomination for Best Engineered Album for engineering Al Green's Lay It Down. In 2015, he won another Grammy for Best R&B; Album as engineer/mixer on D'Angelo's Black Messiah, the long-awaited follow-up to Voodoo.

J. Reynolds started his business which is Winston-Salem, North Carolina. , Winston has the seventh-highest U.S. market share (2 percent) of all cigarette brands, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Maxwell Report. This market share has been falling since 2003, when it peaked at 3.92 percent, although Winston has consistently been in the top 10 cigarette brands by U.S. market share since 2001, according to data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. History Winston was introduced in 1954 by the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and quickly became one of the top selling cigarette brands, using the slogan \\"Winston tastes good like a cigarette should\\". It became the number one cigarette sold in the world by 1966, a position it held until 1972 when Marlboro overtook the brand. In the 1980s, Winston was the most favored brand in Puerto Rico, thanks to their advertising slogan “Winston y Puerto Rico: No hay nada mejor” (Winston and Puerto Rico: There is nothing better). Winston then became the #2 cigarette, a position it continues to maintain today under ownership of Japan Tobacco outside of the U.S. while the American version of the brand has faced steadily declining sales, dropping to sixth place by 2005 in the last national survey.Cigarette Brand Preferences in 2005: Cigarette market value ranking, National Survey on Drug Use and Health, United States Department of Health and Human Services, January 12,2007 , updated July 11,2008. The American version of Winston is also known for its more recent claim of becoming additive free in the late 1990s. This in turn led to a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission requiring Winston to clarify subsequent advertisements that the lack of additives did not result in a safer cigarette. In 1999 R.J. Reynolds was spun off from RJR Nabisco and subsequently sold its non-U.S. operations to Japan Tobacco. On July 15, 2014, Reynolds American (R.J. Reynolds parent company) agreed to purchase the Lorillard Tobacco Company for $27.4 billion and as a result, (to alleviate antitrust concerns) Winston, along with the Kool, Maverick, and Salem cigarette brands was sold to Imperial Tobacco for $7.1 billion. On June 12, 2015, Reynolds American and Lorillard completed their merger and Winston officially fell under ownership of Imperial tobacco spinoff ITG brands. Sponsorship =NASCAR= Beginning in 1971, Winston was the sponsor of the highest title of the NASCAR series, known as the Winston Cup Series. R. J. Reynolds ended Winston's association with the series in 2003. The series is now known as the NASCAR Cup Series. =Drag Racing= From 1975 to 2001, Winston was also the sponsor of the NHRA drag racing series, which is currently sponsored by Coca-Cola through its Powerade, Full Throttle, and Mello Yello brands since. =Superbike World Championship= Winston sponsored the Ten Kate Racing team in 2005 and 2006. In countries where tobacco advertising was prohibited, the acronym \\"WinWin\\" was used instead. =Football/Soccer= Winston was a sponsor of the 1982 FIFA World Cup. Controversy =Winston and The Flintstones= In 1960, Winston was one of the original sponsors of The Flintstones up until 1962. In the commercials, Flintstones characters Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble were seen promoting Winston, and every episode ended with Fred lighting a Winston for his wife Wilma while singing the product's jingle. By the third season, however, the show's ads became more oriented towards children and Winston was replaced by Welch's. =Winston and targeting of African Americans= In the 1970s, Winston specifically targeted the Afro-American minority, similar to what Kool and Newport did during the time. After World War II had ended, American tobacco companies started to explore new markets to maintain their prosperity. The growth in urban migration and the growing incomes of African Americans (called at the time the \\"emerging Negro market\\") gave the tobacco companies what was sometimes called an \\"export market at home\\". Additionally, a new kind of media started to appear after the war when several glossy monthly magazines including Negro Digest (1942, renamed Black World), Ebony (1945) and Negro Achievements (1947, renamed Sepia) began to be published. These relatively expensively produced magazines were far more attractive to the tobacco advertisers than the cheap 'negro' daily newspapers of the pre-war era, with glossy pages and a far wider national distribution. The magazines meant for a purely African American audience also meant that advertisers could produce adverts aimed at and featuring African Americans away from the eyes of white consumers. =David Goerlitz and the Winston Man= Between 1982 and 1988, David Goerlitz was the \\"Winston Man\\", appearing in 42 billboard advertisements – more than the Marlboro man. In 1988, he publicly denounced the tobacco industry and joined the emerging anti-smoking movement after suffering health issues related to smoking. He has spent the last 21 years working in schools as a public speaker, encouraging kids not to start smoking. =Winston and additive free claims= In September 2015, The Food and Drug Administration warned ITG Brands, the makers of Winston cigarettes, that labeling the product as \\"additive-free\\" violated federal law because the claim implied that the cigarettes were safer than other brandsAbrams, Rachel. (August 27, 2015). \\"F.D.A. Warns 3 Tobacco Makers About Language Used on Labels\\", The New York Times. Retrieved May 5, 2019. The August warning letter to ITG marked the first time the FDA had used its authority under a 2009 tobacco-control law to take action against a company for making \\"additive-free\\" (\\"No Bull\\" ad campaign) claims on product packaging. It was one of three warning letters that the agency shipped out in August 2015 to cigarette companies whose products were labeled \\"additive-free\\", \\"natural\\" or both.

PA 39 begins at North Front Street near Harrisburg and ends at U.S. Route 322 and U.S. Route 422 near Hummelstown and Hershey. The route passes through the northern and eastern suburbs of Harrisburg and passes by Hersheypark, Giant Center, as well as the primary production factory for The Hershey Company. Between Harrisburg and Manada Hill, it is known as Linglestown Road, from Manada Hill to Hershey as Hershey Road and from Hershey to near Hummelstown and Hershey as Hersheypark Drive. Prior to the establishment of PA 39 in 1937, PA 39, had previously been designated as a route in northeastern Pennsylvania during the 1920s. That designation was deleted when it was renumbered US 11. As a result, PA 39 is one of a few routes which has a set of child routes which are no where near the primary route. The Linglestown–Manada Hill portion of PA 39 was originally part of Legislative Route 140, one of hundreds of unsigned legislative routes created by the Sproul Road Bill in 1911. LR 140 was later rerouted to bypass Linglestown to the south, and the Paxtonia–Lower Paxton Township portion of its former routing became LR 140A. This legislative route was initially signed solely as PA 894\\\\. PA 39 was assigned in the 1930s to the portion of LR 140A east of Linglestown—overlapping PA 894—and also to LR 22006 between the Susquehanna River and Manadahill. The PA 894 designation was later removed. PA 39 was extended southward to the vicinity of Hummelstown in two stages. The first extension during the 1940s shifted PA 39's eastern terminus to the junction of Hershey Road and Allentown Boulevard (U.S. Route 22) south of Manadahill. Its terminus was moved to its present location in the early 1960s. Only local realignments and improvements have occurred since. Route description PA 39 begins at an intersection with North Front Street on the east bank of the Susquehanna River in Susquehanna Township, Dauphin County, north of the city of Harrisburg. It heads northeast as Linglestown Road through a densely populated neighborhood and widens from two to four lanes as it passes over Norfolk Southern Railway's Pittsburgh Line and approaches an interchange with U.S. Route 22 and U.S. Route 322 at the northern tip of Wildwood Lake. East of the exit, the highway reverts to two lanes and passes through the predominantly residential northern suburbs of Harrisburg. It intersects North Progress Avenue prior to passing into Lower Paxton Township. Flagpole at the PA 39 / North Mountain Road intersection in Linglestown prior to the construction of a roundabout West of the village of Linglestown, Linglestown Road intersects Colonial Road, and then continues east to Linglestown, where it intersects North Mountain Road at a roundabout. Outside of the village, the amount of development along the highway declines as the route passes through areas of forests and open fields. Continuing east, the road becomes more developed as it approaches an interchange with Interstate 81 at exit 77\\\\. Just east of the interchange, PA 39 intersects Jonestown Road and changes names from Linglestown Road to Hershey Road. Unlike Linglestown Road, which followed a mostly east–west alignment, Hershey Road has a north–south orientation. It heads south from Jonestown Road to intersect US 22, here an at-grade roadway named Allentown Boulevard, near Skyline View. Hershey Road continues onward, snaking southeastward through a rural region of Dauphin County to the vicinity of Hershey. During this stretch, it passes through South Hanover Township and serves the communities of Hanoverale and Union Deposit. The route crosses into Derry Township after crossing over Swatara Creek, then intersects Hersheypark Drive near the creek's southern bank. Hershey Road continues south from here as Park Boulevard, a service road for the Hersheypark amusement park, Hersheypark Stadium, Hersheypark Arena, The Star Pavilion, Giant Center (where the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League play), and Hershey's Chocolate World; however, the route veers westward onto Hersheypark Drive and bypasses Giant Center to the north. This portion of the road is four lanes wide, the first significant portion of PA 39 to be that many lanes wide since the area surrounding I-81. Overhead signage at the eastern terminus of PA 39 near Hummelstown PA 39 heads south bypassing the village of Hershey to the north and west. It passes under Norfolk Southern Railway's Harrisburg Line, then enters a highly developed area east of the borough of Hummelstown. Here, the road intersects Walton Avenue, a local street connecting Hersheypark Drive to the village. This is the final junction along PA 39 as the route ends later at a modified cloverleaf interchange with US 322 and U.S. Route 422. History =Legislative Routes= Legislative Route 140, an unsigned legislative route extending from Harrisburg in the west to Pottsville in the east, was created on May 31, 1911, through the Sproul Road Bill, which established the initial set of legislative routes throughout Pennsylvania. LR 140 entered Linglestown on North Mountain Road, then turned to follow modern PA 39 from Linglestown to Manadahill, where it veered onto Jonestown Road. LR 140 was realigned by 1926 to follow a direct route between Paxtonia and Manadahill via Jonestown Road. The portion of former LR 140 from Paxtonia to the Lower Paxton–West Hanover township line was then redesignated as LR 140A. All of LR 140A was designated as the signed PA 894 by 1930. In the Omnibus Road Bill Act of 1931, LR 22006 was established, spanning the portion of current PA 39 from the Susquehanna River north of Harrisburg to Hanoverdale at the West Hanover–South Hanover township line, three miles north of Union Deposit. The remainder of current PA 39 north of Swatara Creek was a state-aid route designated A-306, which ran from South Hanover Township to Union Deposit. Those sections of roads were paved in 1926, in preparation for gaining state aid. =Designation= PA 39 was assigned on May 1, 1937, by the Pennsylvania Department of Highways to the portion of LR 22006 between the Susquehanna River (at North Front Street) and Manadahill and to the section of LR 140A east of Linglestown, overlapping PA 894 along the latter. PA 894 was also extended northward along Piketown Road to a junction with PA 443 near Piketown. The overlap between PA 39 and PA 894 was eliminated in the 1940s when the entirety of the PA 894 designation was removed. Two years after PA 39 was assigned, the Harrisburg Regional Planning Commission issued a report drafted by Harrisburg city planner Malcolm H. Dill that addressed transportation needs for the Harrisburg region. The Dill plan proposed rerouting US Route 22 along Linglestown Road from Harrisburg to Manadahill, replacing PA 39. Ultimately the Dill plan was not selected by PennDOH and PA 39 was not deleted. =Extensions= The first change to PA 39's routing came in the 1940s. During this time, U.S. Route 22 was rerouted through Dauphin and Lebanon County to follow Allentown Boulevard instead of Jonestown Road. As a result, PA 39 was extended a short distance southward along LR 22006 on what is now Jonestown Road, Harper Drive, and Hershey Road to meet the new alignment of US 22 south of Manadahill. This section of PA 39 was rerouted in 1969 when a new road was constructed between Jonestown Road and Manada View Drive which directly connected Linglestown Road to Hershey Road. The alignment on Jonestown Road and what became Harper Drive was deleted. PA 39 was extended further southward on LR 22006 and A-306, as well as parts of Legislative Routes 22011 and 22013, in 1961, to a new terminus at U.S. Route 322 and U.S. Route 422 near Hummelstown. At the time, it was routed on Hanover Street in the vicinity of Union Deposit. The portion of Hanover Street south of Canal Street (between Canal Street and West Derry Road - today part of Hersheypark Drive) had previously been part of PA 340 from the 1930s to the early-to- mid-1950s. The portion of the route between Old Chocolate Avenue and Walton Avenue near Hummelstown and Hershey had previously been part of US 422 from 1927 to 1952. A new highway around the eastern fringe of Union Deposit was constructed in 1968 and opened to traffic as a realignment of PA 39, later that year. Park Boulevard in Hershey was rerouted in 1973 to intersect the new bypass and provide a direct connection between Hersheypark and PA 39. =Rehabilitation projects= Progress Avenue, from September 2009. In the early 1970s, the portion of PA 39 in Susquehanna Township from North Sixth Street to Laurelwood Drive was converted from a two-lane roadway to a four- lane divided highway as part of the construction of the US 22 and US 322 bypass. The divided highway was extended west to North Front Street in the early 1990s. To the southeast, the segment of PA 39 south of West Chocolate Avenue near Hummelstown was rebuilt as a divided highway ca. 1990. All of Hersheypark Drive east to Laudermilch Road was converted into a divided highway by 1995. The piece of PA 39 near I-81 was reconstructed into a four- line divided roadway ca. 1990. In 2009, PA 39 was widened to five lanes (two lanes in each direction with a center turning lane) when a new shopping center near the intersection of PA 39 and Progress Avenue was built. At the same time, West Hanover Township made improvements to the area surrounding PA 39's interchange with Interstate 81\\\\. Prior to the improvements, there was only one traffic light in the vicinity, located at Jonestown Road. Several traffic lights and two additional lanes with a center concrete barrier was added to handle the increased truck traffic caused by the construction of warehouses nearby in 2003 and 2004. PA 39 was also improved in Linglestown square, when two roundabouts were installed between 2009 and 2011.

The phrase is from the Latin translation of the New Testament: :\\"Omnia munda mundis; coinquinatis autem et infidelibus nihil mundum, sed inquinatae sunt eorum et mens et conscientia\\" : (\\"To the pure all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled\\") - Epistle of Paul to Titus, I:15 In Chapter VIII of I Promessi Sposi by Alessandro Manzoni the sentence is pronounced by Father Cristoforo in relation to the stunned attitude of Friar Fazio at the arrival of Renzo and the other threatened (among whom two women, Lucia and her mother, Agnese): :When they were inside, Father Cristoforo very softly shut the door. Then the sexton could no longer contain himself, and, taking the Father aside, whispered in his ear: - but Father, Father! at night… in church… with women… shut… the rule… but Father! - And he shook his head. While he hesitatingly pronounced these words, «just see!» thought Father Cristoforo, «if it were a pursued robber, Friar Fazio would make no difficulty in the world; and a poor innocent, escaping from the jaws of a wolf…» --Omnia munda mundis, -- said then, turning suddenly to Friar Fazio, and forgetting that he did not understand Latin. But such a forgetfulness was exactly what produced the effect. If the Father had begun to dispute and reason, Friar Fazio would not have failed to urge opposing arguments; and heaven knows how and when the discussion would have come to an end; but, at the sound of those weighty words of a mysterious signification, and so resolutely uttered, it seemed to him that in them must be contained the solution of all his doubts. He acquiesced, and said: - that's enough! you know more about it than I do. Due to this famous passage the sentence is sometimes erroneously credited to Alessandro Manzoni.

Jimmie Fidler (August 26, 1898 - August 9, 1988) was an American columnist, journalist and radio and television personality. He wrote a Hollywood gossip column and was sometimes billed as Jimmy Fidler. Born James Marion Fidler in St. Louis, Missouri, Fidler was a Hollywood publicist and advertising man who became a highly successful syndicated columnist with his \\"Jimmie Fidler in Hollywood\\" column in 187 outlets, including the New York Post and the Los Angeles Times. In 1933-34 his 15-minute NBC radio show, Hollywood on the Air, sponsored by Tangee lipstick, was broadcast from the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. He was regarded in Hollywood as a genuine threat to gossip queen Louella Parsons, especially after he scooped her in November 1935 on a major story about Clark Gable, an incident so embarrassing to Parsons that she lied about it in her autobiography.Barbas, Samantha. The First Lady of Hollywood: A Biography of Louella Parsons. University of California Press, 2005. Films Fidler had brief experience in movies before he became a columnist. Winning first prize in a contest in Memphis, Tennessee, took him to Hollywood. Once there, he was an extra before he \\"worked his way to semi-important roles.\\" Fidler interviewed film personalities for the Hollywood segments of Fox Movietone News. Such was Fidler's influence that a negative comment by him could affect the box office drawing power of a star. According to Time, in January 1938 he was sued for libel by Constance Bennett for $250,000 after he reported she snubbed Patsy Kelly on a Hal Roach movie set and that studio workmen bought flowers for Kelly but none for Bennett. Fidler won the case, with the judge ruling that remarks against a public character, even if false, are not libelous if made without malice. In 1938 Fidler made a short MGM documentary film, Personality Parade, about actors making the change from silent films to talkies. It featured clips of more than 60 performers whose careers began in silent films. Television By 1950, Fidler was earning more than $250,000 a year and was heard by 40 million listeners over 486 radio stations. During 1952-53, he hosted the live television drama series, Hollywood Opening Night on NBC.\\"Obituary: Jimmie Fidler,\\" The New York Times, August 12, 1988.

It is located at around between the rivers Tekhura/i and Tsivi, at an elevation of 28–38 meters above sea level. Senaki is the center of the Senaki Municipality and serves as a residence of Metropolitans of Senaki and Ckhorotskhu Eparchy of the Georgian Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church. Etymology According to Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani the name \\"Senaki\\" (სენაკი) means \\"small room\\" or \\"chapel\\" in Georgian. From 1935 to 1976 the town was called \\"Mikha Tskhakaya\\" in honor of the Georgian Bolshevik revolutionary leader Mikhail Tskhakaya. In 1976 the name was simplified to \\"Tskhakaya\\". After 1989, the town was given back its original name. History The geographical name \\"Senaki\\" first appears in the 17th century referring to the old trade settlement and cathedral on the right river bank of the river Tekhura/i. Historically it was an administrative center of Senaki Yezd and part of the Kutaisi Governorate. After the beginning of the construction of the Poti- Tbilisi railway line (1872), the center was relocated to its current location, 5 km away from the old settlement. Senaki was one of the important centers of the mutiny against the Bolsheviks in 1924 as well as the center of the Georgia military mutiny of 1998. The town used to be an important military airbase during the Soviet period. The Second Infantry Brigade of the Georgian Army is now stationed on the same base. It was renewed after 2005 to meet NATO standards. The town was also the site of a battle during the 2008 South Ossetia war. Demography and population Historically Senaki is known as a distinctly mono-ethnic town with a majority of Georgians. According to the 2002 state census 98% of the total population were ethnic Georgians. The oldest official data about the population of Senaki stems from the 1897 census and counted 1248 people (927 – male, 321 – female). The 1950s-1970s were an important period for the development of Senaki which also affected the growth of the population. The 2014 census counted 21.596 people (including IDPs from Abkhazia). Today, besides Georgians (99,4%), Russians (0.19%), Armenians (0.18%), Assyrians (0.11%) and others (0.12%) are living in Senaki. During Soviet times a lot of Jews were living in the town. They mostly left town in the late 1970s. Economics Senaki is an important station of the Tbilisi – Poti and Tbilisi – Zugdidi railway lines. It also connects several roads of international and national importance. Due to its location Senaki is one of the leading economic and trade centers of the Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region. During the Soviet period there used to be mechanical, carpet manufacturing and brick producing factories; The processing of wine, tea and citrus were developed there. The small and middle-sized industries functioning today in Senaki include several agro products (nut, laurel, tea, milk, corn) processing factories, wood and asphalt production. In June 2016, construction of a Euro 4 standard cement producing plant began close to the town. Cement produced in Senaki will target both local and export markets. At a three kilometer distance from Senaki the resort Menji can be found. During Soviet times it was a famous balneologycal and recreational water resort, which, nowadays, is severely damaged and abandoned. Culture and education Historically Senaki was one of the important cultural and educational centers of the region. Two years after the establishment of the Georgian Theatre in 1879, the first performance was held in Senaki. One of the first nobiliary schools in Georgia was opened in Senaki (Currently Dzveli Senaki) in 1884. Famous Georgian writers, academics and public figures including Simon Janashia, Konstantine Gamsakhurdia, Arnold Chikobava, Varlam Topuria, Petre Kavtaradze were taught in this school. Architecture and landmarks One of the important landmarks of the town constitutes the State Theater in Baroque Revival style (architect Vakhtang Gogoladze). The theatre is part of the Georgian cultural heritage and is under rehabilitation until 2018. The town is also famous for its neat streets with red brick houses. At proximity to the town, on the so-called \\"Archangel hill\\", the historical church built by the monk Alex Shushania (named Senakeli) in 1908 can be found. The church was one of the few churches which were not closed during Soviet times in Georgia. North of the town different kinds of spiritual and historical sights are situated: the Teklati Convent, the Shkhefi fortress and the Sakalandarishvilo fortification. Close to Senaki the ancient archeological and historical site of Nokalakevi (Archeopolis, Tsikhe-Goji) can also be found. According to the different sources (e.x. F. Diobua de Monpereoux) the mythical Colchian town \\"Aia\\" and then capital of Lazica () \\"Tsikhegoji\\" was located there. Annual events =Egrisoba= \\"Egrisoba\\" () – The main annual event and public festival in Senaki.

It is exported to the United States as the Scion xA and Scion xD, the Middle East as the Toyota xA and to Europe and Latin America as the Toyota Urban Cruiser for the second generation. The Ist, the sixth brand to use the Vitz as the base model, was conceived as a high-end multi-use compact car with SUV-like styling and wagon-like roominess. The car was fitted with either a 1.3-liter (FWD) or a 1.5-liter engine (FWD or 4WD), with a Super ECT transmission. A wide front grille consisting of two thick horizontal bars, large 15-inch tires, and extended wheel arches gave the vehicle its unique and dynamic exterior styling. The body dimensions were a notch above those of the Vitz, giving more space to the cabin and the trunk. The 6:4 split rear seats could be fully folded to widen the deck as necessary. The sturdy body structure was realized through the advanced GOA (Global Outstanding Assessment) process, which enhanced safety in collisions with heavier vehicles. In Japan, it is available at Toyota dealerships Netz Store and Toyopet Store. The car's name is derived from the suffix \\"-ist,\\" the name points to a person who is passionate about something (stylist, artist, specialist, and so on). __TOC__  First generation (XP60; 2002) Based on the first generation Toyota Vitz hatchback, the first generation Ist also shared a platform with the Platz sedan. The model codes are NCP60 (1300, 2NZ, FWD), NCP61 (1500, 1NZ, FWD), NCP65 (1500, 1NZ, 4WD). The Ist was developed from the Vitz supermini in a crossover SUV bodystyle offering the flexibility of larger SUVs, but with the advantage of better fuel economy from a smaller vehicle. It first appeared at the 2001 Tokyo Motor Show, and was placed into production in 2002. The ist is meant to cater to younger drivers, being sold as a Scion in North America and as the xA in the Middle East. The Ist interior features a unique interior with an easy to read central instrumental cluster position similar to the Vitz, Platz and Vios. At its introduction, 42,000 orders were received in Japan. Its primary competitor is the Honda Fit and the Nissan March. The first-generation car was used by the Shizuoka Prefectural Police as a police car.

This new Ist, like its predecessor, is sold as a Scion in the US. But instead of being the new xA, it is called the xD. The only real difference between the Ist and xD is a revised front fascia. In Europe and Latin America it is sold as the Urban Cruiser with slightly different front panels. In Japan, the Ist is sold in 2 grades namely 150G and 150X and equipped with Super CVT-i for the 1NZ-FE option. One appealing offer for the 1NZ equipped model is the choice of AWD, which was not carried over to the US for the xD. Furthermore, a center console is offered on Japan's Ist, but not the US' xD. The 180G with the 2ZR-FE engine option was also offered until August 2010. Starting with production model year 2007 in Japan, G-BOOK, a subscription telematics service, is offered as an option. The former Kanto Auto Works produced the Ist from January 2010. Production of the Ist ended in March 2016. Sales of the Ist were discontinued in Japan on 29 April 2016. It is replaced by the Yaris Cross in 2020. = Urban Cruiser = The Urban Cruiser is a version of the second generation Ist that was sold in Europe. It was first introduced in 2008. It is slotted below the RAV4 to compete against small crossover SUVs like the Nissan Qashqai and Kia Soul, while also attracting buyers of mainstream family hatchbacks. Designed by Toyota ED², it debuted at the March 2008 Geneva Motor Show and went on sale shortly thereafter. Unfortunately, the Urban Cruiser did not have sales success in Europe after 2011 due to the ongoing strength of the Japanese yen, and production was discontinued in 2014. It will be replaced by the Yaris Cross in 2021. The \\"Urban Cruiser\\" nameplate is reused in India since August 2020 which is based on the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza.  Mechanicals and emissions  The Urban Cruiser is powered by a 1,329 cc petrol engine that produces and , or a , 1,364 cc turbo diesel. Front-wheel drive is standard, but the diesel model is also offered with an all-wheel drive option. Both come with a 6-speed manual transmission. There is no automatic option.  Safety  Despite being equipped with seven airbags, anti-lock brakes and traction control, the car received a relatively poor Euro NCAP safety rating of 3/5 stars.

A force of Patriots led by General Francis \\"Swamp Fox\\" Marion and Lt. Colonel \\"Light Horse\\" Harry Lee set out to capture the British post at Fort Motte, the informal name of a plantation mansion fortified by the British for use as a depot because of its strategic location at the confluence of the Congaree and Wateree rivers. The British garrisoned roughly 175 British soldiers under Lt. Daniel McPherson at the fort. Marion and Lee learned that Lord Rawdon was retreating towards Fort Motte in the aftermath of the Battle of Hobkirk's Hill. The Americans forces invested the place on May 8 and wanted to capture the fort before Rawdon arrived. Two days later, Marion called for the British to surrender and McPherson refused. The next day, Colonel Lee informed Mrs. Motte that he intended to burn the mansion down to force the British out. On May 12, 1781, the American forces had entrenched themselves close enough to the mansion they were able to hit the roof with flaming arrows. Mrs Motte, a patriot, accepted Lee's plan, and offered her own arrows for it. The mansion was set on fire. Marion's artillery fire added to the desperation of the British and, by one o'clock that afternoon, Lt. McPherson surrendered the garrison to the Patriots. Background Great Britain's \\"southern strategy\\" for winning the American Revolutionary War appeared in some ways to be going well after the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in March 1781. General Lord Cornwallis had defeated General Nathanael Greene, but his army was short on supplies and had suffered significant casualties, so he decided to move to Wilmington, North Carolina to resupply and refit his troops. Greene, while he had lost the battlefield, still had his army intact. After shadowing Cornwallis for a time, he turned south, and embarked on an expedition to recover Patriot control of South Carolina and Georgia, where British and Loyalist forces were thinly distributed, and smaller outposts were subject to attack from larger forces under the command of Greene or one of the Patriot militia commanders in the area. He first ordered Colonel Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee to continue shadowing Cornwallis so that his southward movement was screened. Once he was on his way into South Carolina, he ordered Lee to abandon Cornwallis and instead join forces with militia Colonel Francis Marion in the eastern part of the state. Lee and Marion met on April 14, and first targeted Fort Watson, a small stockaded fort on the east side of the Santee River, which fell after a short siege. They chased after John Watson, the fort's usual commander, who had led a force away from it in search of Marion, but was forced onto the defensive when Lee arrived. Lee and Marion then targeted Fort Motte, a key British supply depot and communication point not far from the confluence of the Congaree and Wateree Rivers. The British had taken over Mount Joseph Plantation, owned by Miles Brewton and then occupied by his sister, the widowed Rebecca Brewton Motte and her children, who had left the city of Charleston. The British fortified the area around the mansion, building palisades, ramparts, trenches and abatis.Letter, Sumter to Greene, May 2nd 1781. Greene Papers, Volume III. p. 193 They garrisoned a force of roughly 175, made up of British soldiers, Hessians, and Provincials under Capt. Lt. Donald McPherson at the fort. Siege Arriving May 8, Lee and Marion immediately surrounded the fort, which was dominated by the two- story Motte residence and garrisoned by about 140 British and Hessian regulars under Capt. Lt. McPherson. On the approach of the Americans, the British had evicted the widowed Rebecca Motte from the main house, and she had taken up residence outside the fort at the overseer's house. As the forces of Watson and Rawdon were still active and might come to relieve the siege, Marion and Lee needed to bring the siege rapidly to a conclusion. At Fort Watson they had constructed a tower from which the attackers could fire into the fort, but this idea was not workable under the conditions at Fort Motte. The idea was then put forward to set fire to the buildings within the defenses. Mrs. Motte, apparently sympathetic to the Patriot cause, provided the arrows that were used to ignite the roof of the house on May 12. When the defenders tried to go onto the roof to extinguish the flames, the attackers fired on them with their six-pound gun, driving them off. The garrison surrendered shortly after, and the Americans moved quickly to put out the fires before the whole house was engulfed. Aftermath The captured garrison was released on parole to return to Charleston. Before they left, Mrs. Motte and the American and British officers shared a meal. General Marion proceeded to the port of Georgetown, where the British garrison fled without resisting, while Lee was ordered by General Greene to assist in recapturing Augusta, Georgia.

He made contributions to the understanding of the weak interaction and he and his students are credited with developing the so-called standard model of elementary particle physics.Biographical memoir for the National Academy of Sciences by Steve Adler, pg. 1. He was a Higgins professor of physics at Princeton University, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and member of the JASON Defense Advisory Group. He was a student of Enrico Fermi and John Alexander Simpson Jr. Treiman published articles on quantum mechanics, plasmas, gravity theory, condensed matter and the history of physics. Background Treiman's parents, Abraham and Sarah, were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who emigrated to Chicago. Sam had a brother, Oscar, who was six years older. Sam was educated in the Chicago public school system and, after graduating high school in 1942, he entered Northwestern University, electing to study chemical engineering. After two years at Northwestern he joined the navy, training as a radar repair technician and he spent the last year of the war as a petty officer in the Philippines, doing, in his words, \\"a prodigious amount of reading in the peaceful jungles - novels and science\\".Adler, op. cit. pg 2 After the war he went to the University of Chicago, receiving a B.S. (1949) and M.S. (1950), having changed his major to physics. He received an Atomic Energy Commission predoctoral fellowship and in 1952 he was granted a PhD by the University of Chicago. His doctoral thesis dealt with the physics of cosmic rays, and the work was done under the supervision of John Alexander Simpson. While at the university, Sam met his wife, Joan Little, an educational psychologist. They have three children - Rebecca, Katherine and Thomas. Sam began teaching at Princeton in 1952 as an instructor. He spent his entire career at Princeton - associate professor (1958–63), professor (1963–77) and Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics (1977–1998). He served as chair of the physics department (1981–87) and chair of the University Research Board (1988–95). Probably his best known student at Princeton was Steven Weinberg, recipient of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1979. Other well known students are Nicola Khuri (1957), Curtis Callan (1964), and Stephen L. Adler (1964). When Fermilab was set up in 1970, the founder, Robert R. Wilson, invited Treiman to direct the theory group. Rather than leave Princeton permanently, Treiman took a number of extended leaves of absence, in order to get the group started. As a member of the National Academy of Sciences and JASON Defense Advisory Group, he was a key advisor to the U.S. Government in the fields of plasma physics, physics education and strategic planning. Treiman and his wife were active members of CUSPEA - a program conceived by T.D. Lee to facilitate the admission of mainland Chinese students to graduate education in the U.S. The couple visited China in 1981, 1982 and 1988 to examine and interview prospective candidates. A feature of Treiman's work was his ability to devise simple, unambiguous experimental tests for theoretical predictions and phenomena. In addition to his own work, Treiman was widely recognized as a teacher and mentor, supervising more than two dozen graduate students over three decades. His Socratic teaching style enabled his students to gain valuable insights without having been spoon fed the results. He was known for his general wisdom as well as his expertise. One of his more paradoxical sayings is known as Treiman's theorem: \\"Impossible things usually don't happen.\\"Frank Wilczek and Betsy Devine, Longing for the Harmonies: Themes and Variations from Modern Physics (1987); 1989 pbk edition He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1963. Treiman was awarded the Oersted medal by the American Association of Physics Teachers in 1995. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

It blends 2D animation with CG elements, and is set at \\"Galaxy High\\" (not to be confused with the school in the 1980s animated series of the same name), where a trio of young students try to balance their regular teenage lives and their training to become Space Marshals. The concept and animation style is similar to that of both Totally Spies! and Martin Mystery, other series created by Marathon Media. Team Galaxy is co-produced by a number of international broadcasters, such as France 3 which was the first to begin airing the full series from 28 August 2006. In the United States, Cartoon Network paid Marathon about $16–$17 million for 52 episodes, for a premiere in fall 2006. It also appears on Canada's YTV and CITV/Jetix in the UK. Plot \\"Team Galaxy\\" is about a group of friends who try to balance both their school work and their free time. The three protagonists, Josh, Yoko, and Brett, are among the students of a school called \\"Galaxy High\\", a galactic justice authority, which defends the galaxy against criminals. The school teaches subjects suitable for these types of missions, which their students endure. The series apparently takes place during the present day, but in an episode where they go through a time skip, a calendar says that the year is 2051, hinting that the actual series takes place in 2050. Since the final 3 episodes of season 2 of Team Galaxy 'Predator Plants from Outer Space', a new plot has been introduced where Omni, an android as well as a student of another space school, is searching for his fellow schoolmates after his school has been destroyed by an alien bounty hunter named Gangus. He is convinced to stay at Galaxy High for the time being and is promised by Josh, Brett, Yoko, and the rest of GH to help him. Unfortunately, due to the show currently ending at 52 episodes, this plot hasn't been addressed any further. Characters =Students= * Yoko (Kiko in the French dub): Yoko is the main protagonist. A 15-year-old karaoke-loving wannabe pop singer (who can't carry a tune) and amazingly creative artist who sees Galaxy High as just a step on her way to stardom. Her main weapon is her sonic blaster. Yoko's terrible singing is a running gag in the show, and despite how bad it is, she wins many interstellar competitions with it (aliens think her voice is music while Josh and Brett start crying in pain.) Often, Yoko is distracted on missions when a talent competition or something that could boost her career pops up. She is also a fashion wizard who is always conscious of her looks and style. Her desire for stardom and fame often lead to her capture or place the group in danger. She had a crush on Seth, until she heard his voice. Her suit as a space marshal is light purple. She is in the same team as Josh and Brett. She is voiced by Katie Griffin. * Josh Kirkpatrick: Josh is the rebellious 17-year-old adrenaline junkie, who prefers space training to classroom theory. He mostly fails his classes but succeeds on his missions. He was afraid of water after a childhood incident involving losing his swimming trunks, but has since overcome it after facing it head-on. But for all his wild stunts, Josh's independent thinking is a perfect fit for the team. Although he has repeatedly said he wants to be out of GH, he has never really meant it. His father is the GH's principal, Principal Kirkpatrick. His suit as a space marshal is dark blue. He is in the same team as Brett and Yoko. He is voiced by Kirby Morrow. * Brett: Brett is the 10-year-old headstrong genius, who despite his brilliance feels restricted by his young age. He hates to be called a \\"kid\\". He uses his own personal computer to control the hornet, to analyze DNA, and to use Gluefoam. Brett takes missions more seriously than Yoko and Josh, and often scoffs when they shirk their mission. He is the most sensible of the group, but due to his youth and fun-loving partners, he is often ignored. Josh often uses him to do his own homework or for other selfish reasons. His suit as a space marshal is red. He is in the same team as Josh and Yoko. He is voiced by Tabitha St. Germain. * Bobby von Poppin: One of Yoko and Josh's rivals from Galaxy High. He is by far the most competitive student, and with his high grades and sharp skills (and big ego), he isn't shy about telling everyone who's the top gun on campus. His suit as a space marshal is purple. He is in the same team as Toby and Kimball. He is voiced by Sam Vincent. * Toby McMaster: Always out to prove that she is the toughest student on campus, Josh describes her as the cutest and most popular girl in school. She always has to be the center of attention, which annoys Yoko. Her suit as a space marshal is yellow. She is in the same team as Bobby and Kimball. *Princess Kimball: Kimball is a princess. Her privileged upbringing has made her a bit naive and oblivious about the other students. Much like her friend Toby, her suit as a space marshal is yellow. She is in the same team as Bobby and Toby. * Spavid: Spavid is one of the few alien students at Galaxy High. He is well liked by all in spite of his general clumsiness. After growing into adulthood, he developed superhuman powers and enhanced reflexes but chose to suppress them after he let them get to his head. His suit as a space marshal is purple. He is in the same team as Ryan (Orion) and Andi (Andromeda). He is voiced by Sam Vincent. * Orion and Andromeda: They are also known as twin brother and sister, Ryan and Andi. They are from outer space, but on Earth they are known as \\"global citizens\\". Ryan's suit as a space marshal is presumably purple, meanwhile Andi's suit as a space marshal is presumably yellow, like other typical space marshalls. They are both Spavid's teammates. * Seth: A talented musician and Yoko's love interest. He once seemed to be cold and to have no interest in Yoko, but it turned out that he simply did not speak so as to not strain his voice, and was too shy to ask her out. His suit as a space marshal and his team remain unknown. =Teachers= * Principal Kirkpatrick (Sarge) (Brian Dobson): A former commander of a military academy who was brought in to be principal at Galaxy High, whose students are determined to get on his last nerve. He has a jolly personality amid his usual strict demeanor. He is afraid of speaking to large crowds, but has since overcome his fears after reading Yoko's book about overcoming stage fright. Captain Smith is also his longtime buddy; it is unknown whether it's true or not. * Mrs. Schragger: Galaxy High's astronomy teacher. She has unusually accurate senses of hearing and vision, which makes cheating and chatting in her classroom utterly impossible. * Mr. S (Spzoerscliipw’): The team's favorite teacher, despite his unattractive physical appearance by human standards. * Mr. Fitch (Trevor Devall): A fast- talking space cowboy who is head of showing the new equipment for marshals. He is infamous among the students for assigning huge amounts of homework. * Ms. Roskoff: A Russian ex-cosmonaut who teaches Space Investigation Training. She is the school's most athletic instructor. =UltraPets= On the first day of school at Galaxy High, each student is assigned a pet robot that serves as an aide and companion to them. Although they're cute, if provoked an Ultrapet can transform into a powerful fighting machine and, in the blink of an eye, can immobilize an alien foe upon its master's orders. * Fluffy (Cathy Weseluck): Yoko's ultrapet, a cute robotic weasel (who behaves like a dog) which helps the students throughout their missions. He is capable of transforming into a bipedal attack mode. Bears a strong resemblance to Latias, the female of the Eon Duo from the Pokémon Franchise. * Spike: Spike is Toby's ultrapet.

Besides Sanskrit and Hebrew there might be other etymologies from Egyptian, where the word Ki-Ra means \\"like Ra\\", or Persian. Due to the Greek interpretation of the Persian king's name Kourosh (کوروش, Kūrosh) as Κύρος (Kýros) – which was obviously modeled after the Greek word κύριος (kýrios \\"lord\\"), the feminine form being κυρία (kyría) – Kyra (or Kira) can also be understood as a variant.

In Russian Kira () is the feminine form of the masculine name Kir, meaning \\"mistress, ruler\\", but can translate to \\"leader of the people\\", \\"one the people look to\\" or \\"beloved\\".

The film is a sequel to the 2005 film Sarkar and the second installment of Sarkar film series. The film was premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, the New York Asian Film Festival, and the 9th IIFA World Premiere-Bangkok. The film was archived at the Academy of Motion Pictures library. The primary cast features Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan (who reprise their roles from the original) and new entrant Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Supriya Pathak, Tanisha Mukherjee and Ravi Kale also reappeared in their respective roles from Sarkar. The film released on 6 June 2008 and was critically and commercially successful. The continuation and third installment Sarkar 3 was released on 12 May 2017 to positive reviews.  Plot  The sequel is chronologically set two years after the original film. Anita Rajan (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan), is the CEO of Shepard Power Plant based in London, holds a meeting with Mike Rajan (Victor Banerjee), her chairman father, and Hassan Qazi (Govind Namdeo), as a seemingly shady business adviser and facilitator; regarding an ambitious proposal to set up a multibillion- dollar power plant in rural parts of the state of Maharashtra in India. Qazi states that this project will be impossible due to possible political entanglements. When Anita asks him for a solution, Qazi states that enlisting the support of Subhash Nagre (Amitabh Bachchan) (commonly referred to by his title of Sarkar), who he describes as a criminal in the garb of a popular and influential political leader, might help their cause. Along with the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shinde (Shishir Sharma), they approach Sarkar with the idea of this project, who refutes the idea, due to the fact that the power plant will be built in various villages, affecting the livelihood of 40,000 people. However, when Shankar (Abhishek Bachchan) convinces him of the benefits of the project to the state, Sarkar agrees to the proposal. Shankar advises Anita to stay away from Qazi, as he is not trustworthy. Qazi joins hands with Kaanga (Sayaji Shinde), who wants to become the Chief Minister of Maharashtra but could not as Sarkar is the overlord for Shinde's political party. Shankar and Anita begin campaigning in Thackerwadi to gain support of local public for the project. During their chat Shankar mentions that his toughest decision of life was to kill his own elder brother Vishnu, Anita tells that her father never saw her as a daughter and was her boss. Sanjay Somji (Rajesh Shringarpure), leader of farmer's association is shown to be protesting the Nagre's. Meanwhile, Avanti, now Shankar's wife reveals to him that she is two months pregnant, Shankar also has growing friction in relationship with old family aid Chander (Ravi Kale). On the other hand, Shankar's wife Avanti's car is bombed within the premises of Sarkar's villa, and Avanti is killed, Sarkar who is shaken suffers a shock and is admitted to a hospital. Shankar replaces Bala (Sumit Nijhawan) as head over Chander (Ravi Kale), and asks him to quickly find out who was behind this brutal attack. Kantilal Vohra (Upendra Limaye) come to Sarkar requesting him to shift the project to Gujarat. As Sarkar refuses, Vohra, Kaanga, Qazi, are shown together hatching a plan. Chander calls up Shankar telling Qazi was behind the blast, Shankar shoots Qazi in his house. Mike comes to India and is seen to be meeting Vohra discussing about eliminating Shankar as, they both want only profit and Shankar aims for development for 40,000 villagers living in Thackerwadi also. Vohra and Kaanga now hire a hit-man to kill Shankar for 5-Crore. While, Shankar and Anita are on a holiday, Anita cautions Shankar about an impending attack on them, a sniper shoots at Shankar six bullets, who later succumbs to his injuries in hospital. A furious Subash suspecting Vohra kidnaps him. Sarkar tells Anita that his men have killed-Kaanga, Chander, Vohra and her father who was in London as revenge. He also tells her that these people were just pawns and the mastermind behind all this was his own guru, Rao Sahab (Dilip Prabhawalkar) who wanted his grandson Somji to take over Shankar. His guru comes to home to pay tributes to Shankar, where Sarkar shows him his dead grandson. The film ends with Anita becoming Shankar's replacement.

Critic Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave the film four stars out of five and noted \\"Besides its strong content, Sarkar Raj has been filmed exceptionally well with superb performances. Amitabh Bachchan, expectedly, comes up with a terrific performance. He's as ferocious as a wounded tiger in the finale and takes the film to great heights. Abhishek Bachchan is cast opposite the finest actor of this country, yet he sparkles in every sequence. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is fabulous and delivers her career-best performance.\\" Sify gave a two-star rating and said, \\"The only reason you might want to catch this is the performance level and the relatively good ending. Amitabh Bachchan is dependably good. Abhishek holds his own, though with a more filled-out character, he could have taken it to another level. Aishwarya is superb in the emotional scenes, but again, is let down by the unforgivably simplistic character sketching.\\" Rediff which also gave a two-star rating noted \\"This is a watchable\\". The Economic Times gave a three star rating out of five and said \\"Sarkar Raj clearly gains major marks for its clever culmination, which was so much lacking from recent RGV products. The considerately and crisply penned dialogues by Prashant Pandey add a lot of insight to the scenes and depth to the characterizations.\\" Anupama Chopra from NDTV stated \\"What works here are the performances. The Bachchans-all three of them are in fine form. Despite wonderful performances and nicely done dramatic moments, Sarkar Raj doesn't pack the visceral punch of Sarkar\\". Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India rated the film with three and a half stars and applauded the lead performances saying \\"This film carries the sequel forward without losing out on the gritty feel and retains the charisma of the central characters\\". Critic Nathan Southern of MSN gave four stars citing that \\"Sarkar Raj thrives on its narrative cliffhangers, that the film never once fails to engage the audience; the premise and its characters are rock-solid, its dialogue convincing, and its suspense palpable. Varma and scriptwriter Prashant Pandey pack such unusual twists and double-crosses into the tale that even the most hardened and seasoned moviegoer will find the conclusion impossible to foresee\\". = Box office reception = Sarkar Raj grossed almost 340 million in India and over $1 million in the USA. The Filmfare Magazine (August 2008 issue) and other media declared it to be among the only four hits in the first half of 2008 (along with Race, Jodhaa Akbar and Jannat). The producers reported that the movie had earned more than the entire grossings of its hit prequel in its first two weeks itself. According to the year end report of The Free Trade Journal, Sarkar Raj was the seventh highest all-India grosser of the year after (in order) Ghajini, Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, Golmaal Returns, Singh Is Kinng, Dostana and Race. The trade magazine also reported high international collections. It was declared a super hit grosser at the box office.

Apparently Ram Gopal Verma had even shown Raj Thackeray rushes of the film to allay his fears of being wrongly portrayed.  Sequel  In 2009 Ram Gopal Verma stated that he had no plans finalised for the third instalment in the series and shelved Sarkar 3. However, in 2012 it was reported that the sequel would go ahead once again and currently is in the pre production stage where the script is being written. The film is expected to go on floors at the end of 2013, primarily with the same cast of Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan although his character dies at the end of this film and also Aishwarya Rai is to be left out. In August, 2016 director Ram Gopal Varma confirmed Sarkar 3. He told on his Twitter that Abhishek and Aishwarya will not be a part of the third installment.

Upon his promotion to editor, Rignall changed the magazine's editorial direction focusing more on the newly emerging Japanese video game consoles instead of the fading 8-bit generation of computers.https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/oh-my-god-what-have-i-got-myself-into- the-amazing-rollercoaster-story-of-the-golden-age-of-video-game-magazines/ In 1990, recognising the console market was large enough to warrant a magazine of its own, Rignall launched Mean Machines.https://retrogamerdaz.com/julian-jaz- rignall-interview/ Covering the top-selling video game systems of the time, such as the Super NES and Mega Drive, Mean Machines became the largest-selling multi-platform publication in the United Kingdom. At first the print run of the magazine was kept limited, to create demand. In 1992, Mean Machines was split into two separate publications: the officially endorsed Nintendo Magazine System, now known as Official Nintendo Magazine, and Mean Machines Sega.https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/oh-my-god-what-have-i-got-myself-into-the- amazing-rollercoaster-story-of-the-golden-age-of-video-game-magazines/ In late 1993, Rignall launched his final British publication, the officially endorsed Sega Magazine. During this period, Rignall appeared regularly on TV as a games reviewer on the British TV programme GamesMaster, and made numerous appearances on BBC Television and BBC Radio as an industry commentator and field expert. =1994–1997: US software development= In 1994, Rignall transitioned from magazine publishing to software development, joining Virgin Interactive Entertainment in Irvine, California. As vice-president of design, he was responsible for product design and licensing acquisitions from other game developers and publishers. While at Virgin, Rignall contributed to such titles as Agile Warrior F-111X, NanoTek Warrior, The Lion King, The Jungle Book and the highly anticipated, but never published, Thrill Kill. =1997–2002: IGN expansion= In 1997, Rignall left Virgin and moved to San Francisco, California, to join the Imagine Games Network (IGN). As editorial director, he led the expansion of the online network guiding it to its market leadership position. In 2001, IGN was awarded a People's Voice Webby Award. The editorial tone and style Rignall helped establish in IGN's early years still continue to this day. =2002–2007: Online retailing and marketing= During 2002, Rignall shifted from the games business into online retailing and marketing. He became editorial director at Walmart.com responsible for the content of the world's biggest retailer's online presence. Rignall has stated that he did not enjoy the experience but \\"did learn an unbelievable amount from [it].\\" In 2004, Rignall moved to Haggin Marketing, a San Francisco advertising agency where he created print advertisements and other marketing vehicles for Dell, Inc. In 2006, Rignall became the vice-president and editorial creative director with Bank of America's user-centred design and research division where he developed consumer, business and marketing content for the company's 22 million website customers. =2007–2010: Future Plus Custom Publishing= In August 2007, Rignall rejoined Future US (formerly Imagine Media) to help launch the US branch of their UK-based custom publishing division, Future Plus. He spent three years at Future Plus creating consumer content solutions for Fortune 500 companies such as Best Buy, Kmart, Apple, Blizzard-Activision, Toys \\"R\\" Us and Research in Motion/BlackBerry.

Early life Kubrick was born on August 5, 1960 in Los Angeles, to filmmaker Stanley Kubrick and actress Christiane (née Harlan). She had an elder sister, Anya (April 6, 1959 – July 7, 2009), from whom she was said to be \\"inseparable\\" in childhood. She also has an elder half-sister, Katharina, from her mother's first marriage. Career Kubrick made cameo appearances in four of her father's films: as Dr. Floyd's daughter, nicknamed \\"Squirt\\", in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), as a guest at Bryan's birthday party in Barry Lyndon (1975), as a guest on a ballroom couch in The Shining (1980), and as a news camera operator in Full Metal Jacket (1987). In her late teens, Kubrick directed, filmed, and edited a half-hour documentary for the BBC, Making 'The Shining', which is included on all DVDs and many videotapes of the film. She composed the score to his next film, Full Metal Jacket, using the pseudonym Abigail Mead. She also shot 18 hours of footage for a documentary on the making of the film, but it remained unfinished. Her father asked her to compose the score for Eyes Wide Shut, but she left for California without completing it. Although he wrote her a 40-page letter in an attempt to persuade her to return, she chose not to do so. The film instead used music by Jocelyn Pook. In October 2008, Kubrick appeared at a 40th anniversary screening of 2001: A Space Odyssey sponsored by the Jules Verne Society, where she appeared onstage with actor Keir Dullea, star of the film, Daniel Richter, who played the chief ape in the film, and Malcolm McDowell, who starred in her father's subsequent film, A Clockwork Orange (1971). She accepted the Society's Legendaire Award on behalf of her father. Personal life In August 2010, her family announced that since 1999 she had been involved in the Church of Scientology and has been estranged from her family since then. Her family was concerned that she did not attend the funeral of her sister, Anya Kubrick, in 2009, nor meet with her earlier while she was dying of cancer. In 2014 she posted a series of photographs of herself and her father to Twitter. Like her father, Kubrick is an animal lover, and has rescued several stray dogs. Kubrick is a supporter of US President Donald Trump. She has used her Twitter account to promote conspiracy theories, including one that COVID-19, and the subsequent reaction to it, are part of a \\"power grab\\" by the \\"New World Order.\\" Filmography { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" +Vivan Kubrick composing work !scope=\\"col\\" Year !scope=\\"col\\" Film !scope=\\"col\\" Notes - !scope=\\"row\\"Full Metal Jacket 1987 Credited as Abigail Mead - !scope=\\"row\\"The Mao Game 1999  - !scope=\\"row\\"Eyes Wide Shut 1999 Score unused in final film } { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" +Vivan Kubrick acting work !scope=\\"col\\" Year !scope=\\"col\\" Film !scope=\\"col\\" Role !scope=\\"col\\" Notes - !scope=\\"row\\" 2001: A Space Odyssey 1968  \\"Squirt\\", Heywood Floyd's daughter Uncredited - !scope=\\"row\\"Barry Lyndon 1975 Birthday party guest Uncredited - !scope=\\"row\\"The Shining 1980 Ballroom party guest Uncredited - !scope=\\"row\\"Full Metal Jacket 1987 Camera operator Uncredited } References External links * Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:American people of Austrian-Jewish descent Category:American people of German descent Category:American people of Romanian-Jewish descent Category:American people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:American child actresses Category:American Scientologists Category:English film actresses Category:English film score composers Category:English Scientologists Category:Female film score composers Category:Jewish American actresses Category:20th-century American actresses Category:Actresses from Los Angeles Category:American conspiracy theorists Category:Stanley Kubrick ","title":"Vivian Kubrick"},{"id":"3915548","text":"Eclair was a film production, film laboratory, and movie camera manufacturing company established in Épinay-sur-Seine, France by Charles Jourjon in 1907. What remains of the business is a unit of Ymagis Group offering creative and distribution services for the motion pictures industries across Europe and North America such as editing, color grading, restoration, digital and theatrical delivery, versioning. The company produced many silent shorts in France starting in 1908, and soon thereafter in America. The American division produced films from 1911-1914 such as Robin Hood, one of the first filmed versions of the classic story in 1912. Deutsche Eclair, now Decla Film, was established as its German studio branch. In 1909, Eclair took part in the Paris Film Congress, an attempt by major European producers to form a cartel similar to the MPPC in America. Originally a production company, Eclair started building cameras in 1912. Studios in the United States An Eclair studio, the Eclair Moving Picture Company, was established in Fort Lee, New Jersey. It suffered a devastating fire in 1914. A western studio set was also established in Tucson, Arizona. Jules Brulatour was involved with the company and Dorothy Gibson one of its stars.

Their real breakthrough design, the Caméflex (shoulder-held portable 35mm camera with instant-change magazines, with later 16/35mm dual format option) introduced in 1947, played a major part in the French New Wave by allowing for a freer form of shooting 35mm fiction films. Later 16mm silent models such as the 1960 Eclair NPR (aka \\"Eclair 16\\" or \\"Eclair Coutant\\") and the 1971 Eclair ACL were documentary cinema favorites. The NPR also saw considerable use in television production and was the standard camera used by 16mm film crews in the BBC's Film Department. Due to its light weight and ergonomic design, which housed the film spools at the back of the camera rather than on top, the NPR was seen as a considerable improvement over its predecessors. For 16mm cameramen out in the field, this ease of use and maneuverability was vital to capture the right shot, often in hostile conditions.Ellis, John; Hall, Nick (2017): ADAPT. figshare. Collection.https://doi.org/10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v1 NPR stands for Noiseless Portable Reflex and ACL comes from the letters of the names of its designers Agusti (Austin) Coma and Jacques Lecoeur. The last models designed by Eclair in the early-1980s came too late to save the company from bankruptcy and were hardly produced, if at all : the Eclair EX16 (similar to ACL with fixed viewfinder and 24/25fps fixed motor) and the Eclair PANORAM (first dual format 16+Super16 camera with \\"Varigate\\" system) The instant clip-on design of the camera magazine of the Caméflex and later the NPR, ACL, EX16 and PANORAM models' coaxial magazines revolutionized filmmaking, in particular documentary films, since magazine changes could now be made in seconds without the need to spend time lacing the film in the camera. The ACL model used a focal plane shutter for exposure and a side-to-side oscillating mirror for reflex viewing to keep the camera body size to a minimum =Famous camera users= Jean-Luc Godard used an Eclair Cameflex when filming Breathless in 1959. Godard wished to film using ambient light, and the Cameflex was the only motion picture camera capable of using ASA 400 35 mm Ilford HPS still camera film. Cinematographer Raoul Coutard spliced the 18-meter still camera rolls into 120-meter rolls for use as motion picture film, and pushed it to ASA 800 during development.The Criterion Collection. Breathless DVD. Special Features, disc 2. Coutard and Rissient. 2007. A handheld Eclair camera was used in the shower scene in the 1960 film Psycho. An Eclair 16 was used by L.M. Kit Carson (and discussed, on camera) in Jim McBride's ground-breaking film, David Holzman's Diary (1967). Two years later, the NPR was chosen by director Michael Wadleigh to shoot his documentary Woodstock. Wadleigh used sixteen NPR cameras. In Woodstock: From Festival to Feature, he explained some of the challenges he faced using a then seven-year-old camera in a manner that would have been unheard of for 35mm movie cameras, let alone the relatively untried NPR. Later company history The company was acquired in late 1968 by UK- based Canadian film producer Harry Saltzman who then founded the Éclair-Debrie (UK) Ltd. company and moved production to the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, Soremec-Cehess took over the French side of the company and resumed production in France, so English Eclair cameras (similar to the French product with minor differences) were manufactured simultaneously for a few years until Éclair- Debrie (UK) Ltd ceased activities in 1973. Production then continued in France with a good degree of success, but the company eventually declined in the late-1970s and early-1980s until it was eventually sold to Aaton S.A. in 1986 who ceased all camera production, offering only a license for maintenance of the many existing cameras. The film processing and post-production side of Éclair continues to operate.

His most successful songs, all written with Phil Coulter, included \\"Puppet on a String\\", \\"Congratulations\\", \\"Back Home\\", and \\"Saturday Night\\". He was presented with three Ivor Novello Awards, including one as Songwriter of the Year. Biography Bill Martin was born William Wylie MacPherson in Govan, Glasgow, Scotland, to Ian and Letitia (Letty) and had an older brother, Ian. They lived in Taransay Road, Govan, near the Fairfield shipyard. Martin was educated at Govan High School, three years ahead of Sir Alex Ferguson; in 2011, they were both inducted into the inaugural Govan High Hall of Fame. After World War II, many of the Glasgow tenements were pulled down and the MacPherson family moved to Priesthill, a new housing scheme on the south side of Glasgow. Having tried, and failed to build a career in the shipyards, Martin completed his apprenticeship as a marine engineer. Although he had actually written his first song at 10 years of age, it was during his apprenticeship that he heard Bobby Darin's song \\"Dream Lover\\" which convinced him that his future lay in songwriting. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music, and had trials to become a professional footballer for Partick Thistle. In 1960, Martin and his new bride, Margaret (Mag) went to South Africa, where he played football for Johannesburg Rangers. On their return, he determined to make songwriting his primary focus, and began using the name Bill Martin as he thought that Wylie MacPherson was \\"too Scottish\\". He spent months working in Denmark Street and finally, in 1963, he had his first song released on record, with \\"Kiss Me Now\\" by Tommy Quickly. The song was released on 22 November 1963, the same day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, and light- hearted songs were not the order of the day. In 1964, he entered into a writing partnership with Tommy Scott. As Scott & Martin he had success with such acts as the Irish trio The Bachelors, Twinkle, the Irish folk band The Dubliners, Van Morrison, and Serge Gainsbourg. In 1965, he met Phil Coulter and the two became established as a successful songwriting team that lasted more than ten years (Martin for the lyrics, Coulter for the melody). They had records with such (mostly UK) acts as comedian and baritone Ken Dodd, American R&B; artist Geno Washington, Los Bravos, Dave Dee & Co, The Troggs, Mireille Mathieu, Dick Emery, Tony Blackburn, Billy Connolly, Cilla Black, The Foundations, Cliff Richard, Sandie Shaw, and Elvis Presley. Between 1967 and 1976 they had four No. 1 hits in the UK: \\"Puppet on a String\\", \\"Congratulations\\", \\"Back Home\\" and \\"Forever and Ever\\". Martin is the only Scottish songwriter to pen four UK number one hits for four different acts. There were also numerous Top 10 hits including the Bay City Rollers' \\"Shang-A- Lang\\", \\"Fancy Pants\\" by the glam rock band Kenny, \\"Requiem\\" by the Scottish pop group Slik, and \\"Surround Yourself with Sorrow\\" by Cilla Black. In 1975, Martin and Coulter were joint recipients of an Ivor Novello Award for 'Songwriter of the Year'. The Bay City Rollers had a No. 1 hit in 1976 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart with \\"Saturday Night\\", a song that was not released as a single in the UK. There were three No. 1 hits in the US for the songwriters, the other two (which were chart-toppers on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and the Adult Contemporary listings respectively) being \\"Thanks\\", performed by Bill Anderson, and \\"My Boy\\", sung by Elvis Presley. In the early 1970s, Martin bought the former home of John Lennon – Kenwood, St. George's Hill – although he later sold it and lived in Belgravia, London and Southampton, Hampshire. He also owned a house in Val Do Lobo, Portugal which he bought in the early 1970s. The songwriters also wrote for the films The Water Babies and Carry On and a number of television theme songs. Having triumphed in the 1967 Eurovision Song Contest with \\"Puppet on a String\\", the first UK entry to win the competition, they finished second the following year in 1968 with \\"Congratulations\\" from Cliff Richard. In April 1968, the British music magazine NME reported that Martin and Coulter were being sued by the Irish songwriters Shay O'Donoghue and Aiden Magennis, claiming that \\"Congratulations\\" had the same chord sequence as their song \\"Far Away From You\\", recorded eighteen months earlier by Doc Carroll & the Royal Blues. In 1975, Martin and Coulter reached the Eurovision final for the third time, this time writing Luxembourg's entry, \\"Toi\\", for Coulter's future wife, the Irish singer Geraldine. The song finished fifth in Stockholm. Their final attempt at Eurovision glory was in 1978, when their song \\"Shine It On\\" finished third in the UK heat A Song for Europe sung by the Glaswegian, Christian. As successful songwriters, record producers and music publishers, Martin and Coulter became a wealthy and powerful partnership in the music industry. Apart from being writers-producers of their own songs, they started a publishing company called Martin-Coulter Music, and signed such other songwriters as Van Morrison, Billy Connolly, Christy Moore, Dónal Lunny, Eric Bogle, Sky, Midge Ure and B. A. Robertson. Although he continued to write music, Martin found himself gravitating to the business side of the music industry by the 1980s. Also, in 1980, he became (youngest ever) captain of the RAC Golf Club in Epsom. His partnership with Coulter ended in 1983 when Martin bought out Coulter's share of the business. He later sold the company to EMI. In his business career, he successfully built up and sold numerous companies in such diverse fields as music publishing, marketing and properties. He once owned the rights for Van Morrison and East/Memphis Music Corp., which he sold respectively to Chappell Music and Rondor Music Catalogue. In 1983 he produced the musical Jukebox, which had a six-month run in London's West End and was featured in the Royal Variety Performance of that year. Jukebox was the forerunner to the plethora of successful 'jukebox' musicals. In 1984, he was executive producer on the Elkie Brooks album, Screen Gems. Martin continued as a songwriter, music publisher and producer with Angus Publications. In 2000, he associated with Sony/ATV Music which sub-publishes his catalogue, while he acquired music catalogues for his partners. Martin was awarded the Gold Badge Award, for services to the music industry, by the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors in October 2009. In November 2012, he received the Sunday Mail Living Legend Award. In 2017, Martin published his autobiography, Congratulations. Songwriter To The Stars, with his friend Stuart 'Cheeky' Cheek helping him collate the memories. He had four children, two from his marriage to Mag, and another two from his second marriage to Jan Martin (nee Olley) whom he married in 1972. Bill Martin died on 26 March 2020, aged 81.

A Kemetic is one who follows Kemetism. There are several main groups, each of which takes a different approach to their beliefs, ranging from eclectic to reconstructionist. However, all of these can be identified as belonging to three strains, including: reconstructed Kemetism (adopting a philological and scholarly approach), a syncretic approach, and a more novel synthesis tending toward monotheism, Kemetic Orthodoxy.Harrison, PM (2012). Profane Egyptologists: The Revival and Reconstruction of Ancient Egyptian Religion. UCL (University College London).  Worship  Followers of Kemetism generally worship a few gods (Maat, Bast, Anubis, Sekhmet or Thoth, among others), but recognize the existence of every god. This worship generally takes the form of prayer and setting up altars, but there are no set guidelines for worship. Altars can contain items such as candles, offerings, or statues.

Written by series creator Rob Thomas and directed by Mark Piznarski, who also directed the pilot, the episode originally aired on UPN on September 28, 2004. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica's newfound friend Weevil (Francis Capra) is arrested for credit card fraud, and she goes on the case to figure out who actually did the crime.  Synopsis  Veronica is talking with Wallace Fennel (Percy Daggs III) in the halls of the high school. Wallace finds an invite to an 09-er party. With some help from Veronica, he deciphers the code which states when and where it will take place. At the party, Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) and Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn) interact with other popular students. Weevil bursts onto the scene and gets into an argument with Logan because Weevil normally uses the beach. As the debate becomes increasingly heated, the Sheriff's department appears and the partygoers quickly disperse before they have to show IDs. The next day, Weevil is approached by the Sheriff's department, who arrest his grandmother on charges of credit card fraud, even though they actually believe it was Weevil who committed the crime. Afterwards, Mrs. Navarro's lawyer visits Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni) and expresses his belief that it was Weevil who stole the credit card. Veronica states that Logan framed Weevil, but she is dismissed by the other two. The Mars family goes on the case. Veronica visits Weevil to find out more, but he rebuffs her questions. While Veronica and Keith are at a diner, Don Lamb sits down at their table and berates him for the handling of Lilly Kane's (Amanda Seyfried) murder one year earlier. Offended, Keith retorts and the two argue. Then, Veronica goes to a newspaper class with Mallory Dent (Sydney Tamiia Poitier) after telling Wallace to copy Weevil's attendance records. Her first assignment is to do a story with her ex-boyfriend, Duncan. Veronica finds proof that Weevil is not guilty, but Keith tells her that Weevil has already confessed. Veronica also finds a correlation between Logan's web history and the credit card charges. Veronica's car also has a flat tire. Troy Vandegraff (Aaron Ashmore) helps her, to the chagrin of his popular friends. Duncan comes and offers Veronica a ride to the beach, where they are doing their story. The awkward car ride is juxtaposed with a flashback of a similar car ride between Veronica and Lilly. After Veronica and Duncan do the story, they are stopped by a police car on the way home. It mysteriously comes to light that the car (which was Lilly's) had many tickets on it that were not paid and is about to be impounded. As Keith and Jake Kane (Kyle Secor) come to pick up their respective children, a tense moment occurs. A flashback describes in detail Keith's accusation of Jake as the murderer of Lilly Kane. On the ride home, Veronica asks for Keith's help in investigating Weevil's crime. The two put on an act—Veronica feigns pregnancy and asks the concierge whether or not there they can track the credit card number (which she hands to the concierge). They hand back the bill summary and Veronica deduces that Logan's girlfriend, Caitlin (Paris Hilton) paid for room service on the Echolls family credit card one night. Troy invites Veronica to a party, despite knowing about her exclusion from the popular group. Veronica calls the numbers on the credit card summary. When one of the phones is busy, she asks her dad to run a check on it. Meanwhile, Weevil's cousin Chardo (Wilmer Calderon) threatens Logan. Veronica then pressures Weevil's cousin into confessing that he was behind the fraud, which he confirms. He was also secretly carrying on an affair with Caitlin, thus explaining the room service bill. Veronica confronts Mrs. Navarro and explains how Chardo spent the credit card taking out Caitlin. Mrs. Navarro then gives up Chardo after realizing that he was taking out a spoiled teenager. Weevil is released. Both Logan's friends and the motorcycle gang are now after Chardo. Logan's group reaches him first, but Weevil agrees with Logan to release him. Although Chardo first believes that Weevil saved him, the leader soon lets his henchmen beat up his cousin for putting him in jail. Veronica confronts her dad about why he accused Jake Kane. Although he doesn't tell her why, she begins to suspect that the Kanes may actually have had a role in the murder. In addition, Veronica sees that Logan and Caitlin have broken up.  Cultural references  The following cultural references are made in the episode: *Duncan references \\"Gettin' Jiggy wit It\\". *The episode references Torrey Pines Golf Course. *Veronica says \\"Smell ya later,\\" a catchphrase of Nelson Muntz. *Wallace talks about James Bond. *Veronica mentions Charlie's Angels. *In flashback's, Lilly says that she reads Sassy. *Veronica and Wallace use phrases common in Blaxploitation films.

The episode was written by Rob Thomas and directed by Mark Piznarski, the same creative team who wrote and directed the pilot. The episode's title is a play on words: \\"Give credit where credit's due\\" is a phrase, and the episode is about credit card fraud. \\"Credit Where Credit's Due\\" features the first appearance (a small cameo) by Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen), who would later become a series regular the following season. On casting the character, Thomas elaborated, \\"[w]e hired him because we liked his look; he looked like a blond California surfer boy.\\" The character was created so that Logan would have another friend besides Duncan. The writers came up with Dick's name through referring to the character as \\"a dick\\". The episode featured several guest stars, including socialite Paris Hilton as Logan's girlfriend, Caitlin. Hilton was already a celebrity when the episode aired. Fans often treat her guest appearance as out of character for the show.

Valbanera was a steamer capable of carrying close to 1,200 passengers. She sailed a regular route between Spain and Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Gulf Coast of the United States. The ship sank with the loss of all 488 people on board during the Florida Keys Hurricane in September 1919. Sinking In the summer of 1919 the ship left the Canary Islands after earlier calling at several ports in Spain, loaded with cargo and 1,142 passengers, mostly immigrants to Cuba, and 88 crew members. Although most of the passengers were booked for Havana, 749 left the ship when it called at Santiago de Cuba on September 5. The 1919 Florida Keys Hurricane hit Havana on September 8, before Valbanera reached the port. While the storm was raging an unidentified ship was seen off the harbor entrance signalling for a pilot, but the harbor was closed and the ship was notified it could not enter. The ship acknowledged and signalled it would move away from shore to ride out the storm. On September 13, the Cuban consul in Key West contacted the commandant of the United States Navy base in Key West concerning rumors that Valbanera had sunk. Radio operators at the base reported hearing Valbanera in contact with the Morro Castle radio station in Havana on September 12, but further investigation indicated that they had probably mistaken the call letters for Infante Isabel, ECY, which had been in contact with Morro Castle, for the call letters for Valbanera, ECV. The last confirmed radio communication with Valbanera had been on September 9. The U.S. Navy submarine chaser spotted a submerged wreck with just the masts above water in the vicinity of Rebecca Shoal (about west of Key West) on September 12, but identified it as a two- masted schooner. Two other Navy ships passing the area on September 13 did not notice anything of a wreck. Another sub chaser sent out on September 16 returned the next day with confirmation that a large ship was wrecked on Half Moon Shoal. On September 19 Coast Guard cutter Tuscarora and sub chaser 203 were able to see the name Valbanera on the wreck. The next day the officer who had reported the wrecked schooner on September 12 confirmed that he had seen Valbanera. The wreck was east of Rebecca Shoal, with just the masts and a couple of lifeboats above the water. There were 488 passengers and crew on Valbanera when she sank. No bodies were seen or recovered.

Griggs, 2003 The Bible from scratch page 52 According to the Catholic Encyclopedia article on Parables: \\"There are no parables in St. John's Gospel\\" and according to the Encyclopædia Britannica article on Gospel of St. John: \\"Here Jesus' teaching contains no parables and but three allegories, the Synoptists present it as parabolic through and through.\\" Early Christian art The image of the Good Shepherd is the most common of the symbolic representations of Christ found in early Christian art in the Catacombs of Rome, before Christian imagery could be made explicit. The form of the image showing a young man carrying a lamb round his neck was directly borrowed from the much older pagan kriophoros (see below) and in the case of portable statuettes like the most famous one now in the Pio Cristiano Museum, Vatican City (right), it is impossible to say whether the image was originally created with the intention of having a Christian significance. The image continued to be used in the centuries after Christianity was legalized in 313. Initially it was probably not understood as a portrait of Jesus, but a symbol like others used in Early Christian art,Eduard Syndicus; Early Christian Art; pp. 21–3, Burns & Oates, London, 1962 and in some cases may also have represented the Shepherd of Hermas, a popular Christian literary work of the 2nd century.The Two Faces of Jesus by Robin M. Jensen, Bible Review, 17.8, October 2002Understanding Early Christian Art by Robin M. Jensen, Routledge, 2000 However, by about the 5th century, the figure more often took on the appearance of the conventional depiction of Christ, as it had developed by this time, and was given a halo and rich robes,Syndicus, 130–131 as on the apse mosaic in the church of Santi Cosma e Damiano in Rome, or at Ravenna (right). Images of the Good Shepherd often include a sheep on his shoulders, as in the Lukan version of the Parable of the Lost Sheep.  Pagan symbolism  Late Roman marble copy of the Kriophoros of Kalamis (Museo Barracco, Rome) In ancient Greek cult, kriophoros or criophorus (Κριοφόρος), the \\"ram-bearer\\" is a figure that commemorates the solemn sacrifice of a ram. It becomes an epithet of Hermes: Hermes Kriophoros. In two-dimensional art, Hermes Kriophoros transformed into the Christ carrying a lamb and walking among his sheep: \\"Thus we find philosophers holding scrolls or a Hermes Kriophoros which can be turned into Christ giving the Law (Traditio Legis) and the Good Shepherd respectively\\".Peter and Linda Murray, The Oxford Companion to Classical Art and architecture, p. 475. The Good Shepherd is a common motif from the Catacombs of Rome (Gardner, 10, fig 54) and in sarcophagus reliefs, where Christian and pagan symbolism are often combined, making secure identifications difficult. This is defined as syncretism, a blending of images from different cultures and religions.

Mammals have long cochleae, and are able to distinguish different sounds by mechanisms such as mechanical tuning, in which the stiffness and length of hair cells’ stereocilia makes a given cell best suited to respond to a certain type of stimulus. The basilar membrane of animals with long cochleae also vibrates at different locations along the membrane in response to different frequency sounds. Since the reptilian ear lacks a long cochlea, electrical tuning provides an alternative mechanism for perceiving differences in sound. With a combination of voltage-gated calcium channels and calcium sensitive K+ channels, the cells set up an oscillation in voltage and oscillate in response to a depolarizing stimulus. Ca++ enters the cell and depolarizes it, opening K+ channels which allow K+ to leave and hyperpolarize the cell. Since the exit of K+ from the cell is delayed, the voltage increases, but then with the exit of the K+ the cell overshoots the membrane potential and hyperpolarizes. Different cells have different delays for K+ leaving and thus the voltage oscillates at different frequencies. The delays can be as short as 0.7 ms or as long as 150 ms, whereas the Ca++ entry always occurs within about 1 ms (Fettiplace, 1987). Thus by varying the length of delay for K+ to leave, cells' ion concentrations can oscillate at specific frequencies. Cells with higher oscillating frequencies respond best to higher-frequency sounds, while those with lower frequencies respond best to lower frequency ones. Which cells resonate best with a given sound tells the brain what the frequency of the sound is. Hair cells that respond to high frequency stimuli send information to specific neurons, and the information remains segregated in the brain. Thus, information about sound frequency is preserved, rather than being lost as it would if all information from different hair cells converged on the same neuron or group of neurons.

Students For a Free Tibet (SFT) is a global grassroots network of students and activists working in solidarity with the Tibetan people for human rights and freedom. The group uses education, advocacy, and nonviolent direct action with the goal of achieving Tibetan independence. SFT advocates self-determination for Tibet because of Tibet's historical status as well as opposing the Chinese government's violation of the Tibetan people's human rights, cultural heritage, environment, language and religion.Students for a Free Tibet : History and Culture History Students for a Free Tibet (SFT) was founded in 1994 by pro-independence Tibetans, supporters, and students in New York City to use the influence of youth in order to press for human rights and independence in Tibet. Initially, SFT's activities were focused on raising awareness amongst fellow students and young people on campuses and at events such as the 1994 Lollapalooza music tour. Students for a Free Tibet's profile and membership grew with the advent of the Tibetan Freedom Concerts, which provided a vehicle for youth involvement in the Tibetan independence movement. Currently, SFT is an international network of more than 650 chapters at universities, colleges, high schools, and communities in over 100 countries. SFT's International Headquarters remains in New York City. There are also a few satellite offices and organizing hubs; SFT Canada has an office in Toronto, Ontario, SFT India has an office in Dharamsala, India, and SFT UK has an office in London. Programs SFT's campaigns focus on three areas: political, economic, and human rights. SFT's political campaigns are focused on generally advocating for Tibetan independence by pressuring both Chinese officials as well as SFT members' government representatives. SFT is well known for high-profile protests against Chinese dignitaries when they visit foreign countries. SFT's human rights campaigns are focused on improving the situation for Tibetans in Tibet by advocating for increased freedoms and rights, and for the release of political prisoners and dissidents. But its website maintains, \\"When we say 'Free Tibet' we don't just mean, 'Make things better in Tibet.' We mean 'Free the nation of Tibet from Chinese occupation.'\\" The stated long-term goal for SFT's economic campaign is to make Tibet \\"too costly for the Chinese government to maintain.\\" One such campaign, held in conjunction with other organizations which promote regime change in China, urged consumers not to buy products \\"made in China\\". The American media commented on the extreme difficulty of such an endeavor; a commentator from the Christian Science Monitor expressed her belief that \\"the solutions to those concerns and others lie in turning toward China, rather than away.\\" Students for a Free Tibet's \\"Leadership Training\\" is focused on developing representatives for the Tibetan independence movement. Part of this is the annual \\"Free Tibet! Action Camp\\" at which dozens of young people gather for a week-long activism training session. Actions Students for a Free Tibet is perhaps best known for its high- profile actions on Mount Everest, the Great Wall of China, and on the Golden Gate Bridge. In March and April 2008, the group's participation in organizing protests and disrupting the Olympic torch relay was criticized by many Chinese nationals. Nevertheless, it succeeded in focusing international attention on the worsening religious, cultural and political situation in Tibet. In 2000, SFT and other Tibetan independence groups controversially launched complaints to the World Bank against the implementation of its loan in 1999 for the China Western Poverty Reduction Project. The groups claimed that the project, to provide irrigation, land improvement, and construction of basic roads to inaccessible mountainous and semi-arid areas in central and western China, would push Chinese migration into Qinghai and \\"suffocate the Tibetan way of life there\\". In response, the World Bank president proposed to delay the project for \\"deeper environmental review\\", but China withdrew its application to fund the project with its own resources. The Chinese Executive Director criticized the groups, saying \\"We regret that because of political opposition... the World Bank has lost a good opportunity to assist some of the poorest people... in the world\\".

History In 1893, the former workers' team at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, Woolwich Arsenal FC, was by now a professional side and had joined the Football League. The workers at the Royal Arsenal, some of whom still played as amateurs for Woolwich Arsenal, proposed a new workers' team to fill the void, and so the same year founded Royal Ordnance Factories FC. Five amateurs from Woolwich Arsenal defected to the new side: Peter Connolly, William George, Jack McBean, Jimmy Meggs and McKenzie;McKenzie's first name is unknown. two more, Bobby Buist and William Stewart joined them later. Additionally, one of Arsenal's founders, David Danskin was also associated with the side as an official and referee. They opted to play in an all-blue kit, and at first played their home matches at the Invicta Ground in Plumstead, Royal Arsenal's old ground. In their first season (1893–94), the club entered the FA Amateur Cup, beating New Brompton before being knocked out 3–2 by Reading. The rest of their first season consisted of friendlies. That changed in 1894–95 when they became founder members of the Southern League. They finished seventh of nine in their first season, and had to play a test match in order to retain their divisional status. They played Old St Stephen's, winning 3–1. That same year, Royal Ordnance Factories challenged their former colleagues Woolwich Arsenal in a local derby, on 25 April 1895; by now the side had moved to a new ground in Maze Hill near Greenwich. Ordnance won the match 1–0, which was halted 15 minutes before time owing to bad light. Later that year, on 7 September, Royal Ordnance Factories were the first to team to ever play Thames Ironworks FC (who would later become West Ham United) at Thames Ironworks' Hermit Road ground; the game ended 1–1. At the end of the 1895–96 season they had finished ninth out of ten in the Southern League and again had to play a test match, this time losing to Sheppey United 4–2. Despite this they managed to retain their league status. In the FA Cup during those two seasons they went out both times to Millwall Athletic in the 4th qualifying round. The club was beset with financial difficulties throughout its life, as well as other problems such as the death of Peter Connolly in 1895. They resigned from the Southern League in the 1896–97 season after only playing seven games. All of those games were lost with a total of 46 goals conceded. In October 1896, Royal Ordnance Factories played Southampton St. Mary's at their Antelope Ground, with the match ending 10–0. In goal for the Royal Ordnance factory was H. Williamson who had been the \\"Saints\\" goalkeeper in 1894–95. Their record was expunged, and it is assumed the club folded soon after, in late 1896. The name was briefly resurrected over twenty years later with a similarly named club from the area, also known as Royal Ordnance Woolwich, that participated in the Kent League for two seasons after World War I.

Orange County Title Company (1889–1960) First American traces its roots to 1889, when Orange County, California—a rural, undeveloped area at the time—split off from the county of Los Angeles. Two firms opened to handle title matters in the brand-new county. Five years later, Charles Edward Parker (C.E. Parker), a local businessman, succeeded in merging the two competitors into a single entity—Orange County Title Company. C.E. Parker became the president of Orange County Title, which, starting in 1909, would pay a cash dividend every year for the rest of the century and would become one of the first abstract companies in California to qualify to issue title insurance policies.First American – Company History Donald Parker Kennedy (D.P. Kennedy), grandson of C.E. Parker, joined Orange County Title in 1948. D.P. Kennedy developed a plan to expand the company beyond Orange County, which was approved by the board of directors in 1957.

It was originally published as a three-part serial in the magazine Galaxy Science Fiction in 1968. The title appears to be based on a Karl Marx quote from The Communist Manifesto: \\"A spectre is haunting Europe...the spectre of communism.\\" Plot summary Scully Christopher Crockett La Cruz is an actor, fortune seeker and adventurer from the long isolated orbital technocratic democracies of Circumluna and the Bubbles Congeries. He lands in what he believes to be Canada to reclaim family mining interests only to discover that Canada is now North Texas and what is left of civilization in North America is ruled by primitive, backslapping, bigger than life anti-intellectual \\"good ole boys\\" convinced of their own moral superiority. In the tortured version of history known to the giant hormone-boosted Anglo-Saxon inhabitants who rule a diminutive Mexican underclass, the original Texas, or Texas, had actually secretly ruled the pre- nuclear war United States since 1845. Texas escaped the nuclear destruction of the rest of the United States because of the foresight of Lyndon the First. An enormous bunker then known as the Houston Carlsbad Caverns-Denver-Kansas City- Little Rock Pentagram and now referred to simply as the Texas Bunker had saved the heartland during a war that destroyed both American coasts, Europe, Russia, China, and Africa. Texas then conquered the rest of the continent, although Hawaii and Cuba remain stubbornly \\"unconquered\\". Reception Alexei Panshin described Specter as \\"an intermittently satirical melodrama about revolution,\\" saying \\"Its greatest strength, in fact, is in conceits and occasional lines.

Stackpole and first published in April 1983 by Blade, a division of Flying Buffalo, Inc. A second edition was later published by Sleuth Publications in 1986, but Flying Buffalo continues to distribute the game. In 2019 a new revised Combined Edition of MSPE was published by Flying Buffalo which brought the different material from the previous editions and included additional new rules and expansions to the original rpg. MSPE's mechanics are based on those of Tunnels and Trolls, with the addition of a skill system for characters. A few adventure modules were also released for MSPE. System =Characters= MSPE determines character attributes by random roll. Skills are purchased for the character by the player using Skill Points. Skills are available in multiple levels, but skill cost goes up exponentially as the level of the skill increases. =Game mechanics= The core game mechanic of MSPE is the saving throw. Unlike Dungeons & Dragons' saving throws, those in MSPE are not used solely to escape danger. Instead, the MSPE saving throw is an attribute roll. The Gamemaster determines the difficulty of the saving throw, and the player then rolls two six-sided dice and adds the value of the relevant attribute of his/her character. MSPE saving throws can also be modified by skills, in which case the level of the skill being used is also added. MSPE uses a \\"loose\\" skill coupling, where any skill can potentially be used in combination with any attribute. In contrast, many other role-playing games use a \\"tight\\" coupling, where each skill has an associated attribute and is used only with that attribute. For combat, MSPE uses the same system as Tunnels and Trolls, with expanded rules for missile weapons (due to the importance of guns in the modern era) and additional rules for martial arts. =Character advancement= Characters in MSPE earn Adventure Points (APs) on the basis of the \\"risk and daring\\" taken (decided by the gamemaster), success in combat, how well the characters handled their mission, and saving throws made. Gamemasters also have discretion to give out bonus APs. Earning enough APs causes the character to increase in level, and each level gives the character points to add to attributes (which can indirectly give more skill points). In addition to overall APs, MSPE characters also earn Skill APs by using their skills. When enough skill APs are earned, the skill in question advances a level, regardless of the character's overall APs and level. Reception In the January–February 1984 edition of Space Gamer (Issue No. 67), W.G. Armintrout compared Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes to Top Secret and Espionage! and concluded, \\"Mercenaries, Spies & Private Eyes is one of the best-presented role-playing games I've ever seen, and if it isn't seriously in contention for a Charlie at Origins I'll be surprised. It should be understood that the game is supposed to be 'fun'. This means it often plays like: 'Make a saving roll to avoid the giant anaconda' or 'Make a saving roll to dodge the charging tiger'; on the other hand, getting involved in even a minor gunfight is a good way to get killed. MSPE is the simplest game of this bunch, yet I find it intriguing. It seems more open-ended than the other games: Utilizing MSPE rules, you could play out such varied adventurers as Murder on the Orient Express, The Dogs of War, or the exploits of James Bond. The rules are excellent, promise to be well-supported, and can be a great deal of fun if you don't take your gunfights too seriously.\\" In the January 1984 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #49), John Sutherland found the rules to be badly organized, and attempted to cover too much, with the result that little of substance was revealed. Sutherland gave the system an overall rating of only 4 out of 10, saying, \\"These rules try to offer too much and end up providing very little. The game concept is good, but the execution is poor... The immense area of diversity that should be available from Agatha Christie to James Bond, is absent. By casting the net too wide, the author captures nothing.\\" Nick Davison reviewed Mercenaries, Spies & Private Eyes for Imagine magazine, and stated that \\"MS&PE; is an unsuccessful attempt to graft too many ideas together. Although it is certainly cheaper than other comparable RPGs ... no introductory scenario is included with the book.\\" In the November 1984 issue of Dragon (Issue 91), Ken Rolston criticized the lack of background material, saying, \\"There is little help on specific institutions like the CIA and FBI. Economics is glossed over (a practical decision, given the time period addressed), and in general there is insufficient support for campaign-level role-playing.\\" However, Rolston liked the \\"pleasant, light and practical\\" writing style, and found two of the chapters in the rulebook, \\"The Art of Detection\\" and \\"Using Live Clues\\", especially useful, calling them \\"necessary reading for mystery FRP gamemasters.\\" In conclusion, Rolston noted the lack of supporting adventures and other published material for the system. \\"There are few supplements available. If you purchase the game, expect to design most of the adventures yourself.\\" In the February 1985 edition of Dragon (Issue 94), Arlen Walker was impressed that character background was an important part of the character creation process: \\"The background a player invents for his character is important in setting up the character, and MS&PE; is one of the few games that acknowledges this.\\" He also liked the combat system, with its emphasis on weapons other than firearms. \\"This might be considered a handicap if what you’re trying to do is role-play the A-Team, but it serves as a definite advantage if you’re trying to get your players to do something besides shoot anything that moves (and many things that don’t).\\" Walker concluded with an unequivocal recommendation: \\"If you’re planning on role- playing in the modern era, whether you’re interested in James Bond or George Smiley — or even Nero Wolfe —this would be an excellent system to choose. If you’re after a system which allows a great deal of freedom of action, both for referee and player, this is by far the best.\\" In 1999 Pyramid magazine named Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes as one of The Millennium's Most Underrated Games. Editor Scott Haring described the game as \\"one of those 'I can't figure out why it wasn't more popular' kind of games, though publisher Flying Buffalo has had enough of those ... to make me think there may be a connection.\\" Reviews *Different Worlds #36 (Sept./Oct., 1984) References External links *Official site *2019 MSPE Combined Edition Kickstarter *Fan-made resources for the game Category:Espionage role-playing games Category:Flying Buffalo games Category:Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes Category:Role- playing games introduced in 1983 ","title":"Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes"},{"id":"3915996","text":"menorah to president Ronald Reagan, White House, 1984.

He lived and practiced in New York City nearly his entire life. Originally trained in botany and pharmacy, Jelliffe switched first to neurology in the mid-1890s then to psychiatry, neuropsychiatry, and ultimately to psychoanalysis. Biography He graduated from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1886, and received his M.D. in 1889 from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. He received a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1900, for which he did a Flora of Long Island for his thesis. Jelliffe was instructor in materia medica in Columbia University and professor of pharmacognosy in the same university. Later he was clinical professor of mental diseases at Fordham University, president of the New York Psychiatric Society, the New York Neurological Society, and the American Psychopathological Association, and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease. He was also a corresponding member of the French and Brazilian neurological societies. He was author of more than four hundred articles. His book, The Modern Treatment of Nervous and Mental Diseases, which he co-authored with lifelong collaborator William Alanson White, has been a classic in the field, with many reprintings. With White, Jelliffe in 1913 founded Psychoanalytic Review, the first English- language publication devoted to psychoanalysis. In it, he wrote a number of articles on psychoanalytic technique, daydreams, and transference. A quite heterodox journal (as it still is), the Psychoanalytic Review continued to publish translations of work by dissidents such as C. G. Jung and Alfred Adler long after they had seceded from orthodox Freudianism. Jelliffe is also credited with important contributions in the field of psychosomatic medicine, of which he is regarded as one of the founders. He began publishing papers about it as early as 1916. These were collected in his Sketches in Psychosomatic Medicine (1939), his only book explicitly on this subject. One of the earliest Freudian adherents in the United States, Jelliffe (with the aid of his rarely attributed first wife, Helena Leeming Jelliffe, who died in 1916) produced after the turn-of-the-century numerous translations of European works in psychopathology, neurology, psychiatry, and psychotherapy. From about 1902 he owned and edited for the next forty years the influential Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease. In 1907 he, in his first collaboration with White, founded and edited the Nervous and Mental Disease Monograph Series, which published the earliest translations of Freud, Jung, Adler, and other European psychoanalysts, as well as monographs in psychiatry and neurology. His and White's Diseases of the Nervous System: A Text-Book of Neurology and Psychiatry (1915, 6th edition 1933) was a standard period textbook that was also the first American textbook to devote substantial space to psychopathology and psychoanalysis (all of part three in the first edition dealt with \\"psychic or symbolic systems\\"). Jelliffe's 1918 The Technique of Psychoanalysis was the first book in any language explicitly devoted to analytic technique. Not an important theoretician in any of the fields in which he practiced, Jelliffe was significant more as a behind-the-scenes mover, especially through his translations and the serials that he owned and edited. Jelliffe was probably the first notable, self-identified American book collector in neuroscience, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis. He amassed an enormous library of books, journals, and offprints (well over ten tons in weight), which must surely have been the largest and most important collection in private hands in North America in the early 20th century. Jelliffe's savings were wiped out by the stock market crash in 1929, so he was forced to continue working into his late seventies. In 1942 he sold the bulk of his book and journal collection to The Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut, though he still retained thousands of books, which Nolan D. C. Lewis inherited after Jelliffe's death. See also * Sigmund Freud * Carl Jung * Herbert Silberer References The principal sources for Jelliffe's life are: * John C.

Very little is known for certain about his life, other than he tutored Charlie Patton in the ways of the blues. There have been suggestions that he moved to Chicago shortly after World War I. He left no recordings. According to researcher David Evans, Sloan was born in Mississippi in 1870, and by 1900 was living in the same community as the Patton and Chatmon families near Bolton, Mississippi. He moved to the Dockery Plantation near Ruleville about the same time as the Pattons, between 1901 and 1904. Patton received some direct instruction from Sloan, and played with him for several years. Two of Patton’s later accompanists, Tommy Johnson and Son House, both stated that Patton \\"dogged every step\\" of Sloan's. Further research based on Census records has suggested that, in 1920, Sloan and his family were living around West Memphis, Arkansas. He may have been the Henry Sloan whose death, aged 78, occurred in Crittenden County on March 13, 1948.

Markey urged the Department of Energy to make every effort to find the experimental subjects and compensate them for damages, which did not occur. DOE officials knew who had conducted the experiments, and the names of some of the subjects. After the report was released, President Ronald Reagan and Vice-President George H. W.

He was featured in Smithsonian Magazine as one of the 10 most amazing survival stories of World War II.  Military career and fall  Immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack, Magee joined the United States Army Air Forces and was assigned as a ball turret gunner on a B-17 bomber. On January 3, 1943, his Flying Fortress—B-17F-27-BO, 41-24620, nicknamed \\"Snap! Crackle! Pop!\\"B-17 #41-24620 \\"snap! crackle pop!\\" aircraft information from 303rdbg.com, Magee's unit.—part of the 360th Bomb Squadron, 303rd Bomb Group, was on a daylight bombing run over Saint-Nazaire, France. This was Magee's seventh mission. Magee left his ball turret when it became inoperative after being damaged by German flak, and discovered his parachute had been torn and rendered useless. Another flak hit then blew off a section of the right wing, causing the aircraft to enter a deadly spin. Magee, in the process of moving from the bomb bay to the radio room, blacked out from lack of oxygen because of the high altitude and was miraculously thrown clear of the aircraft. He fell over four miles before crashing through the glass roof of the St. Nazaire railroad station. The glass roof shattered, mitigating the force of Magee's impact. Rescuers found him on the floor of the station. Magee was taken as a prisoner of war and given medical treatment by his captors. He had 28 shrapnel wounds in addition to his injuries from the fall: several broken bones, severe damage to his nose and eye, lung and kidney damage, and a nearly severed right arm. Magee was liberated in May 1945 and received the Air Medal for meritorious conduct and the Purple Heart. On January 3, 1993, the 50th anniversary of the attack, the people of St. Nazaire honored Magee and the crew of his bomber by erecting a memorial to them.  Personal life  Magee was born in Plainfield, New Jersey, as the youngest of six children. After the war, he earned his pilot's license and worked in the airline industry in a variety of roles. He retired in 1979 and moved to northern New Mexico. He died in San Angelo, Texas, on December 20, 2003, from stroke and kidney failure, at the age of 84.

It has 44,000 members across 1855 branches. Its aims are to improve the conditions for country women and children and to try to make life better for women and their families, especially those women living in rural and remote Australia. The organisation is self-funded, nonpartisan and nonsectarian. History The Country Women's Association was formed in 1922, initially with chapters in both New South Wales and Queensland. South Australia followed in 1926, initially as the \\"Burra Country Women's Service Association\\" with Mary Jane Warnes as its founder and first President. A metropolitan branch was formed in Adelaide in 1928.Parker, Heather The First Fifty Years South Australian Country Women's Association, Adelaide 1979 By 1936 there was a branch in each of the States and territories of Australia. The formation of a federal body was discussed in 1943 and was agreed in 1945 by a meeting of all state presidents. The First Annual Conference of the C.W.A. of Australia was held in Adelaide in 1946. In 1947 delegates were appointed to go to the Associated Country Women of the World Conference in Amsterdam. During the depression years, the CWA helped those in need with food and clothing parcels. During World War II, the CWA provided meals for the troops at Quorn, South Australia and Tennant Creek, Northern Territory, their efforts being rated one of the best voluntary war time services in Australia. CWA members also made camouflage nets and knitted balaclavas and socks for the troops. In 1992, the CWA of Australia was awarded the RSL Anzac Peace Prize in recognition of their outstanding effort in promoting international understanding and contributing to world peace in accordance with best traditions exemplified by the ANZAC spirit. Education, health and wellbeing The CWA awards student scholarships; as well as providing instruction and encouraging participation in the fields of drama, art, music, public speaking, cooking and floral art. The organisation runs workshops for older members on how to use computers, electronic banking and ATMs. Submissions are made to governments at all levels on a wide variety of social issues. Despite the organisation's involvement in a range of issues and activities, the association with cooking, in particular scones persists. Seen as part of the local community in many parts of Australia, and its culture the CWA provides cross-generational support for women's, and children's, health and wellbeing. Property and funding issues The CWA owns a range of properties built and maintained by members. In recent years there has been some controversy concerning the sale of the organisation's bush community halls. Due to CWA being entirely self funded, unlike men's sheds, some individual branches did not have enough members to continue paying for their upkeep, including council rates, insurance, electricity, water and maintenance. Nine halls were sold in New South Wales between 2003 and 2005, including halls at Cowra, Ettalong Beach and Jindabyne.  Queensland Chapter (QWCA)  The Queensland Chapter was formed on 11 August 1922 at Albert Hall, Brisbane. Ruth Beatrice Fairfax was elected the first President. The first meeting of the Toowoomba branch was held at the Town Hall on 12 September 1922. Mrs Ruth Fairfax attended and spoke about the objectives of the organisation. The meeting resolved to hold a conference as soon as there were sufficient representatives to attend. The Queensland chapter was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in 2013. In 2017 the QWCA created its own perfume, '1922', to mark its 95th anniversary. It will be released at 2017 Ekka and was developed by Damask Perfumery in Brisbane. The artwork and branding of the bottle was supplied by Brisbane watercolour artist Michelle Grayson. Gallery File:CWA Elliston.jpgCWA building at Elliston, South Australia.

Read's Drug Store was founded by William Read. He sold it to the Nattans family in 1899. The downtown store was constructed in 1934 by Smith & May, Baltimore architects also responsible for the Bank of America building at 10 Light St. In 1929, one company slogan was \\"Run Right to Reads.\\"http://baltmusindustry.pastperfect- online.com/35171cgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=04FCADF2-3671-45E1-82FD-823175918606;type=102 Read's was purchased from the Nattans by Rite Aid in 1983. The downtown store was the site of an early sit-in during the Civil Rights Movement. Read's downtown Baltimore location has since closed, leaving behind an empty building. There is currently a controversy over whether to raze this building for development or preserve it and turn it into a civil rights museum. Desegregation The Read's store in downtown Baltimore (at Lexington St. and Howard St.) was the site of one of the country's first anti-segregation sit- ins. Students at Morgan State University joined up with a local chapter of the Congress on Racial Equality (CORE) to conduct a demonstration on January 20, 1955. The event was peaceful and lasted for only half an hour. According to Dr. Helena Hicks, a participant in the protest and now a commissioner on the Baltimore City Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation, the protest consisted of seven people who decided mostly spontaneously to enter the drug store. The NAACP confirmed that this was the first sit-in of its kind. Two days later, the store was officially desegregated. Arthur Nattans, Sr., then President of Read's, ran an announcement in the Baltimore Afro- American stating “We will serve all customers throughout our entire stores, including the fountains, and this becomes effective immediately.” The relationship between protestors and store was not entirely combative. Ben Everinghim, a vice chairman of CORE in charge of negotiations with Read's, stated: \\"We feel that Read's management has been understanding and cooperative and we wish especially to compliment them and congratulate them at this time when they have been instrumental in the elimination of discrimination in such wide areas of the city.\\" Historic Preservation Controversy In 2011, the Baltimore Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation voted to grant temporary landmark status to the downtown store. This decision blocked the plan by Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Lexington Square Partners to build a $150 million development on the site. The developers initially planned to raze the building but had later agreed to preserve two walls; preservationists argued that both plans were insufficient. Activists want the building preserved and turned into a civil rights museum. They accuse the city of \\"demolition by neglect\\": avoiding minor repairs and allowing the building to collapse in order to make room for development. Support for preserving the building comes from Baltimore Heritage, a non-profit historical preservation group, and the Jewish Museum of Maryland, which celebrates the Nattans' decision to desegregate early.

In the period between the First World War and 1931, a number of factors contributed to the rise of nationalist activity in Catalonia: the birth of the Irish state, the creation of several European countries from the disintegration of the European Empires, the admission of the right of self-determination by both the Americans (Woodrow Wilson) and the Soviets (Lenin), and the decline of the Spanish Empire (which lost its colonies of Cuba and The Philippines), against the backdrop of the growth of the Catalan economy. This resulted in the creation of the separatist Constituent Assembly of Catalonia in Havana, Cuba, chaired by Francesc Macià. This assembly approved the Constitution of Havana on 30 September and 1 and 2 October 1928, as their project of giving a Provisional Constitution for a Catalan Republic. The Draft Constitution was written by Josep Conangla i Fontanilles (Montblanc 1875 – Havana 1965), a Catalan essayist and poet living in Havana, and the leading Catalan separatist in the Americas during the 20th Century. In 1931 the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed, but the lack of a strong leader and mature separatist party extinguished the aspirations to independence embodied in this text. Therefore, the constitution never came into effect, and instead the Catalan authorities presented the Draft Statute of Catalonia of 1932 to the Spanish Government. This statute (regional constitution), however, was also rejected, and finally the governments of Spain and Catalonia approved the Statute of Catalonia of 1932. In spite of never having entered into force, the Draft Constitution is a very important text in regards to the political ideas and ideals of the Catalan separatist movement before Francisco Franco's dictatorship.

It was introduced at the 1959 National Boat Show in New York City and was one of the first fiberglass boat designs built. The design also launched Alberg's career as a naval architect.Sherwood, Richard M.: A Field Guide to Sailboats of North America, Second Edition, pages 202-203. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The design was built by a number of different manufacturers in several configurations. Production The Triton started with a conversation between Carl Alberg and yacht broker Tom Potter in 1959. Potter thought that there would be a good market for a 28 foot racer-cruiser boat with stand-up headroom, with sleeping accommodation for a family of four and that would cost less than US$10,000. Alberg designed the boat, with classic lines, but made from a new material at the time, fiberglass and with a price of US$9,700. Alberg and Potter approached the Pearson Corporation, at that time a small fiberglass sailboat manufacturer, founded in 1956 by cousins Clint and Everett Pearson. Upon examining the design they agreed to produce it. The two cousins had to borrow the money needed to transport the prototype from Rhode Island to New York for the National Boat Show, but by the show's completion they had 17 orders for the design. The design was initially built by Pearson Yachts in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, United States. It was also built under licence by Jouët of France, who built about 60, and Aeromarine Plastics in California, who built 150 examples. Pearson ended production in 1967. Over 700 were built in total, before production ended in 1968. Design The Triton is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. It was inspired by the lines of the traditional Scandinavian Folkboat. It has a spooned raked stem, a raised transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed long keel. All versions of the design have a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat was factory fitted with a Universal Atomic 4 gasoline engine. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The boat's galley is located on both sides of the cabin at the bottom of the companionway stairs. On the starboard side is a sink that can be covered for use as a chart table. There is also a two-burner LPG stove. The head has a privacy door and is located forward, just aft of the bow \\"V\\"-berth. Additional sleeping space is provided by two cabin berths, providing total sleeping space for four. The genoas have tracks and the mainsail can be roller reefed. There is an anchor locker in the bow. Operational history A review in Blue Water Boats writing in 2012 noted, \\"The Triton sails as gracefully as she looks. She’s forgiving and nimble, though she does tend to exhibit weather helm. To counter this tendency some owners have fashioned small bowsprits to open up the fore-triangle area, while others recut their mainsail with less canvas at the sacrifice of overall sail area. Although a fast boat for her waterline length she’s slow by today’s standards and she doesn’t point very high. Her short waterline means her light air performance is respectable, and as the wind picks up she heels quickly which increases her LWL and therefore hull speed. The boat is relatively tender up to 15 degrees before she stiffens. West Coast boats, being heavier built, are generally stiffer while East coast boats tend to heel earlier but are more responsive.\\" =American Sailboat Hall of Fame= The Triton was inducted into the now-defunct Sail America American Sailboat Hall of Fame in 1995. In honoring the design, the hall cited, \\"A telltale of success is durability and since the boats were built in the infancy of fiberglass construction, they were laid up by hand with more than a few layers of glass in the hulls. The boats will last forever, and the Triton Class Association gathers every year for a National Championship. Successful, ground-breaking, popular, vital – the signs of a classic.\\" Variants ;Pearson Triton :This model was introduced in 1958 and produced by Pearson in Portsmouth, Rhode Island until 1967.

Rabbi Raichik served as a Shaliach (Chabad) for the sixth and seventh Lubavitcher Rebbes. Early life and education He was born in the Polish town of Mlava. In 1936, upon the advice of the famous Amshinover Rebbe, the young Raichik enrolled in the Yeshiva Tomchei Temimim in Otwock, Poland where he learned the Chabad doctrines of synthesis, scholarship, and personal refinement. Fellow students recall Menachem Shmuel Dovid's meticulous observance of the mitzvot and his passionate way of prayer. His Shabbat morning prayer ritual would last as long as six hours, and included lengthy meditations in the Chabad tradition. At night, when reciting the bedtime prayers, Raichik would often become engrossed in introspection into the wee hours, when the time came for morning prayers. During the day he employed his sharp mind in deep Talmudic study. It was in the Lubavitch yeshiva that the young Raichik became attached to the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn. In short time he became one of the select group who memorized and reviewed the Rebbe's discourses, known as choizrim. During World War II With the outbreak of World War II at the end of 1939, Raichik and his fellow yeshiva students were forced to flee Otwock. Shortly before Chanukah that year, Raichik and a friend reached Warsaw, Poland, where the Rebbe guided them and gave them money to escape to Vilnius, Lithuania. Once he reached Lithuania, Raichik labored tirelessly to save fellow students from German-occupied Poland and the Baltic states. Despite his own capture once by border police, he organized smuggling operations, bringing many refugees across the border to safer territory. When Japan's consul to Lithuania, Chiune Sugihara, sacrificed his diplomatic career to issue Japanese passports to Jewish refugees, Raichik helped procure visas for his fellow students and others. After spending close to a year in Kobe, Japan, the yeshiva relocated again, this time to Shanghai, China, where many other Jews spent the remainder of the war years as well.\\"Shanghai Sanctuary\\". TIME. July 31, 2008. In Shanghai, Rabbi Raichik became the foundation for the uprooted Lubavitch yeshiva. In addition to overseeing the daily running of the school, friends recall how lovingly he served as surrogate parent to the younger students. Though given many chances to leave, Raichik chose to stay in until the very last student was able to leave, in 1946. Throughout that period Raichik was in communication with the Rebbe who, in addition to massive fund- raising and rescue efforts for Jews in German-occupied territory and Russia, raised money to send to Shanghai. American years When Raichik finally reached the United States, the Rebbe immediately put him under the wing of his son-in-law and later successor, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson to travel by train across North America to seek out Jews, in groups and as individuals, to identify local communal needs and bolster Jewish identity. For months on end, Raichik criss-crossed the United States, dining on sardines and fruits and vegetables, visiting Jews in places like Chattanooga, Tennessee and Cheyenne, Wyoming, setting up schools and Mikvahs, and generally mapping the way for a future Jewish revival. Because of his obvious refinement and gentle disposition, people took an immediate liking to Raichik. Much of the post-war Jewish infrastructure in many cities across the United States can be traced to Raichik's tireless efforts. After his marriage in 1948 to Lea Rappoport, herself a Holocaust survivor, Raichik and his new bride were dispatched to Los Angeles, California as personal emissaries of the sixth Rebbe. Following the sixth Rebbe's passing in 1950, Rabbi Raichik was among the Lubavitcher Chassidim who pleaded with the Rebbe's son-in-law, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, to become the movement's new leader. The new Rebbe, whose suggestion it was that the Raichiks be sent to Los Angeles, wrote to Raichik that his position was not to be limited to one synagogue, but \\"his net should be spread on the entire city and its surrounding areas.\\" In addition to his work as the Chabad Shliach to Los Angeles, Raichik also continued his practice of traveling around the United States for a number of months each year to spread Judaism and pave the way for future Shluchim to that particular place. Another one of his functions as a traveling emissary of the Lubavitcher Rebbe was to collect money (known as maimed, ), which were personal funds for the Rebbe's private usage. These funds are a non-specified amount of money traditionally given each year by Chassidim. In the spring of 1967 (two days before the outbreak of the Six-Day War on June 3, 1967), the Rebbe issued a directive to start Mivtza Tefillin,A Six-Day War Inspiration: Forty Years Later, And Still Binding (www.lubavitch.com) an international campaign by Chabad Hasidim to influence all male Jews, regardless of their level of religious observance, to fulfill the Mitzvah of Tefillin (phylacteries) daily. Raichik became actively involved in this, making his rounds every day in the Fairfax area of Los Angeles where he lived, and finding Jewish men who hadn't yet put on Tefillin that day. He always carried tefillin, and was known for helping people put them on anywhere and everywhere, including airplanes, airports, trains, the White House, shopping malls, etc. He continued this practice until hospitalized by a stroke in December, 1997. In 1990, Rabbi Raichik was appointed to the executive boards of Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch, (educational arm of the Lubavitch movement), Mahane Israel (the social service arm), and Agudas Chasidei Chabad, the umbrella organization that oversees the worldwide network of Chabad-Lubavitch organizations and institutions. Toward the end of his life Raichik suffered greatly from the debilitating Parkinson's disease, but refused to allow it to hamper his busy schedule. He died on February 4, 1998. His funerals in Los Angeles and New York were attended by thousands of people. In New York, the funeral procession filed past 770 Eastern Parkway and continued to the Old Montefiore Cemetery in Queens, where he was interred close to the resting place of the two Lubavitcher Rebbes he had so faithfully served. He is survived by his ten children and their families, many of whom serve as shluchim and leaders in their respective communities around the globe. His wife Leah died in August 2007.

Sverdrup and his college engineering professor John I. Parcel. The company worked primarily in a specialty field of bridges. The company's headquarters was located in St. Louis, Missouri. The firm was the designer of the ill-fated I-35W Mississippi River bridge, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 1964 (collapsed on August 1, 2007).

Cronosoft's plan was to produce games on real media (usually cassette tape) and market them via their website, and through user enthusiasts groups.  History  Cronosoft was formed in late 2002 as a result of little software being released for older 8-bit computers. The last major commercial releases and magazine support for systems such as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 ceasing around 1993. Its first release, Egghead in Space (the third Egghead game in the series, the first in the series being published by Crash magazine in the UK), was written and developed by Jonathan Cauldwell, and released on cassette format for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum in 2003 Since the beginning, Cronosoft has increased its range of software to include titles, not only for the ZX Spectrum, but also for the Commodore 64, Vic 20, Amstrad CPC, Sinclair ZX81, Sinclair ZX80, Dragon 32 and even the Mattel Aquarius. Popular titles include Platform Game Designer, Astro Nell, Quantum Gardening, Glove, LumASCII and Code Zero. More recent releases have included Quadronhttps://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&id;=34622 by Cosmium, and Sokobaarn,https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php popular but very different games for the ZX Spectrum. Cronosoft's plan is to expand its range to cover even more obscure home computers like the TRS80/Tandy CoCo, Oric, Sord M5, and Texas TI99. Of the 100+ titles released as of 2020, more than half are for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Sinclair ZX81, and Sinclair ZX80 platforms. The next most popular format is the Commodore VIC-20. Cronosoft has been featured in several mainstream computer magazines, including Retro Gamer, GamesTM and Micro Mart, and regularly exhibits at computer shows across the United Kingdom, and has in the past included CGE UK, ORSAM and RETRO BALL.

The episode, written by Jed Seidel and directed by Harry Winer, premiered on UPN on October 12, 2004. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica helps a boy, Justin Smith (Bobby Edner) track down his long- lost father. In addition, Veronica starts a relationship with Troy (Aaron Ashmore), and Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn) starts experiencing severe mental difficulties after he stops taking his antidepressants.  Synopsis  After a group of boys point out Veronica and call her a \\"9,\\" Troy Vandegraff comes up to her and invites her on a trip on his father's boat. After a running schoolmate knocks Veronica's books out of her hands, Duncan Kane helps her pick them up. After school, Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni) questions Veronica about why her guidance counselor called that day. Veronica dodges his questions and tells him her realization that her mother was having an affair with Jake Kane (Kyle Secor). Meanwhile, Duncan is getting annoyed with his parents, especially Jake, who is pressuring him academically. The next morning, Veronica wakes up from a dream in which she is making out with Duncan. Veronica and Keith go to a video store, and Veronica sees one of the boys who was talking about her earlier, Justin Smith. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Duncan has been taking antidepressants for roughly six months. Veronica accepts Troy's proposal to go out, while Duncan talks with Logan (Jason Dohring) about his disappointment towards his new girlfriend, Shelly. Veronica drags Justin into the women's bathroom, where he tells her that he wants her help in finding his long-lost father. Justin is unable to produce any valuable information about him besides that his name is John Smith. Meanwhile, the guidance counselor, Rebecca James (Paula Marshall) meets with Keith and tells him that Veronica talks back to teachers, is late, and is socially isolated. Keith retorts by saying that nothing is wrong with his daughter. At dinner that night, Jake laughs at how Duncan is planning to get a life coach. Duncan angrily pushes back at his parents. The next day, Keith meets Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Veronica tells Keith about her investigations. Veronica asks Wallace to steal guidance counselor records for him. Meanwhile, Duncan has stopped taking his medication. In addition, Justin hands Veronica a mixtape, hinting romantic intentions. Veronica and Troy are having a good time on their date. However, Troy becomes a little too aggressive and Veronica pulls away from his attempts to kiss her. She looks after him in despair. As she wonders what's wrong with her, the camera cuts to Duncan and his new girlfriend making out in a car. However, he accidentally calls her \\"Veronica.\\" Wallace retrieves Justin's guidance counselor file, which contains records that his father died when he was in first grade. However, Justin soon receives a note from his father, leaving a contradiction. Later, Justin visits Veronica and requests her help once again. She accepts. She reopens investigations and makes progress. The next day, Veronica talks to Troy again. When Logan makes a quip to Duncan about Veronica, Duncan gets aggressive. He sees Veronica and Troy talking (and eventually kissing), and flips over the side of the bleachers in anger and jealousy. Veronica takes Duncan to the hospital. Jake questions Duncan about how his accident happened, but Duncan asks his father to leave so he can talk to the doctor himself. Their whole conversation is not shown, but Duncan tells him about his refusal to take the antidepressants. Keith visits the guidance counselor and asks her to talk to Veronica. Veronica shares her pictures of the three John Smiths who live in San Diego to Justin. Justin possibly recognizes the third picture, and Veronica reports that he is a petty criminal. After school, Veronica and Justin follow his father. Justin dashes out to \\"John Smith 3\\" and realizes that it is not his father, even though the two share the same handwriting. Meanwhile, Duncan suffers from hallucinations of Lilly (Amanda Seyfried) as a result of his withdrawal from the medication. Veronica and Justin follow John Smith to his house. Veronica pokes her nose into the house and sneaks into the garage. Although the man denies having a son, a woman (Melissa Leo) soon pulls into the driveway. In fact, it is Justin's father, who it is revealed is a trans woman, now called Julia. They talk in the driveway, and Justin leaves feeling hurt and confused after saying a few hurtful things to Julia. In the car on the way home, Veronica comforts Justin, pointing out that Justin's father drives 90 miles each way just to see Justin while he works at the video store. Veronica soon enough decides to go try to find her mother in Arizona. Meanwhile, Duncan starts taking his antidepressants again. The next day, when Duncan encounters Veronica, he returns to his old, withdrawn self. Keith goes on a coffee date with Rebecca. Justin reconnects with his parent through his video store job. Veronica visits the apartment where her mother stayed, but runs into an old college friend of hers, who does not provide any useful information. In addition, Veronica visits Troy, who embraces her.  Cultural references  Because several scenes in the episode take place in a video store, several movies are referenced: *Julia asks for The Matrix Reloaded. *Julia says that she enjoyed the noir film Consenting Adults. Justin then recommends Body Heat. *Keith mentions The Cowboys when he is renting a movie with Veronica. *Keith also mentions Slap Shot. *Justin makes a reference to Marlene Dietrich. In addition, several other cultural references are made: *Duncan sings part of \\"Summer Nights\\" when he is on the bleachers. *Troy hits his fist on the jukebox during his date with Veronica, referencing a move created by the character Fonzie from the sitcom Happy Days.  Arc significance  *Veronica tries to find her mother. *Going cold turkey from his medications, Duncan hallucinates Lilly telling him that the secret of what really happened the day she was murdered will come out.  Music  In addition to the series' theme song, \\"We Used to Be Friends\\", by The Dandy Warhols, the following songs are heard in the episode: *\\"No Blue Sky\\" by The Thorns *\\"Art\\" by Louque *\\"Goodbye World\\" by Luke Adams *\\"Edge of the Ocean\\" by Ivy *\\"Rock and a Hard Place\\" by Supreme Beings of Leisure *\\"What Are You Afraid Of?\\" by West Indian Girl  Production  The episode was written by Jed Seidel and directed by Harry Winer. Series regulars Eli \\"Weevil\\" Navarro (Francis Capra) and Mallory Dent (Sydney Tamiia Poitier) do not appear in \\"Meet John Smith.\\" The episode features the first appearance of recurring character Rebecca James, the school guidance counselor. In addition, future Oscar winner Melissa Leo guest stars as Justin's biological father. This episode's title refers to Justin searching for and eventually finding and meeting his father, John Smith, who is now called Julia.  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, the episode was watched by 2.71 million viewers, ranking tied for 95 of 101 in the weekly rankings. = Reviews = The episode received very positive reviews, with many commenting favorably on how the episode handled transgender issues. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club praised Duncan's characterization in the episode, stating that \\" 'Meet John Smith' fulfills the important role of introducing Duncan Kane as a character instead of simply a symbol of what Veronica lost after Lily [sic] Kane's murder.\\" He also wrote that \\"[he] admires the maturity with which the show handled the potentially hot-button issue of transgendered people and transphobia.\\" Price Peterson of TV.com lauded the episode. His episode verdict stated, \\"This [episode] was not only packed with mystery and satisfying reveals, it approached My So-Called Life levels of teen angst. So good.\\" Laura Prudom of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.5 of 5. She also praised the handling of Justin's father's sex reassignment. \\" 'Meet John Smith' was reassuringly judgement free about the exploration of gender identity, illustrating the value of looking beyond the surface of a person or situation before rushing to judgement, while resisting the urge to be preachy or condescending. If only more shows could treat LGBT issues so respectfully.\\"  References   External links  *\\"Meet John Smith\\" at Mars Investigations Category:2004 American television episodes Category:Transgender-related television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 1) episodes Category:American LGBT-related television episodes ","title":"Meet John Smith"},{"id":"3916313","text":"The following is a list of notable deaths in July 2006.

Miller & Son, Ltd. was a British publisher of magazines, comic books, and pulp fiction intended primarily to take advantage of the British ban on importing printed matter. Between 1943 and 1966, the firm published British editions of many American comic books, primarily those of Fawcett Comics. They are best known for the 1954 creation of Marvelman – a blatant imitation of the Golden Age Captain Marvel – after America's Fawcett Publications capitulated to National Periodicals (DC Comics). (The two companies had fought a long legal battle in which National claimed Captain Marvel infringed on Superman's copyright.) L. Miller & Son also published a large line of Western comics, many reprints but also some original titles.  History  The company was founded in 1943 by book publisher Arnold MillerOwner of Arnold Book Company and his son Leonard Miller. They started out in 1945 publishing black-and- white reprints of the Fawcett Comics Marvel Family titles, including Captain Marvel Adventures, Captain Marvel Jr., The Marvel Family, and Whiz Comics. Between 1950 and 1952, British writer/artist Mick Anglo produced Space Commando Comics, featuring \\"Space Commander Kerry,\\" for L. Miller & Son.Holland, Steve, \\"Who's Who in British Comics\\", Comics World No. 43, Aceville Publications Ltd (Sept–Oct 1995). Throughout the 1950s L. Miller & Son also published a large line of Western comics. L. Miller & Son's original Western titles, which they started producing in 1954, included Colorado Kid, Davy Crockett, Kid Dynamite Western Comic, Pancho Villa Western Comic, and Rocky Mountain King Western Comic. Some of the longer-running Western reprint titles included Gabby Hayes Western, Hopalong Cassidy Comic, Lash Larue Western, Monte Hale Western, Rocky Lane Western, Six-Gun Heroes, and Western Hero. In 1954, after the National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications decision, L. Miller & Son was forced to cancel their line of \\"Marvel\\" titles (though the company continued to published Whiz Comics minus any Marvel Family stories). Faced with the sudden loss of their star feature, and operating under different copyright laws, the company turned to Mick Anglo to come up with a replacement character that, while ostensibly a new creation, mimicked enough core elements of Captain Marvel to retain the interest of readers who had enjoyed the reprints. Anglo (along with writer Len Miller) created Marvelman. Captain Marvel, Jr., was adapted to create Young Marvelman, and Mary Marvel had her gender changed to create the male Kid Marvelman. The magic word \\"Shazam!\\" was replaced with \\"Kimota\\" (\\"Atomik\\" backwards). Using the \\"new\\" characters, the company launched three titles, Marvelman, Marvelman Family, and Young Marvelman. By the end of the 1950s, L. Miller & Son had cancelled all their Western titles. In 1959, with demand for British-produced comics shrinking, Miller cancelled Marvelman Family and turned both Marvelman and Young Marvelman into reprint books. The titles struggled on, each putting out 346 issues, but were finally cancelled in 1963. Starting in 1961, the company moved into the horror/suspense genre with two new titles, Mystic and Spellbound, both of which culled pre-Comics Code material from American publishers like Atlas, Marvel Comics, American Comics Group, Charlton, and E.C. Comics. L. Miller & Son Ltd. ceased comic book publication in 1966. The physical asbestos printing plates from which Miller had produced their comics, and presumably the rights to the comics as well, were sold to Alan Class, Ltd.. Class, for his part, was interested primarily in horror and science fiction stories and reprinted few of the original Miller creations. (Class was still using some of the Miller printing plates as recently as the late 1990s.)

From 1950, until his death, Hodakov served as chairman of Agudas Chasidei Chabad, the umbrella organization of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. Early life Chaim Mordechai Aizik was born in the Russian town of Beshenkowitz on January 12, 1902 to Sholom Yisroel and Chaya Treina Hodakov. He moved to Riga, Latvia with his parents in 1904. There he was raised in the ways of the Navahrudak Mussar movement, as taught by Rabbi Yoel Barantchik. The young Chodakov excelled in his devotion to Torah study, and in his piety and refined character. An educator and pedagogue, young Chaim Mordechai was appointed principal of the Torah V'Derech Eretz school in Riga at the age of 18. While still a young man, in 1934, he was appointed the inspector of Jewish schools by the Latvian Ministry of Education. His close ties (through Mordehai Dubin) with the dictatorial regime of Karlis Ulmanis, and his strict orthodoxy, accompanied by the radical antisocialism and mass lock-outs of left-orientated teachers caused him to be unpopular with the secular circles of Latvian Jewry.Mendel Mark. Di Yidish- Veltlekhe Shul in Letland. - Tel-Aviv, 1973. - p.260-261  Involvement in Lubavitch  When the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, moved to Riga (from Russia) in 1928, Rabbi Hodakov became drawn to the Rebbe and joined the Rebbe's staff. It was during that period that he became acquainted with Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok's son-in-law, for the first time. In 1940, when the sixth Rebbe escaped from Poland, he asked Rabbi and Mrs. Hodakov to accompany him to the United States. They were one of only a few families who received this privilege and became part of the sixth Rebbe's official entourage. Some time after their arrival in the United States, in 1942, the Previous Rebbe appointed him as director of Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch (the educational arm of the Lubavitch movement), Mahane Israel (Chabad) (the social service arm), and Kehot Publication Society. Role as secretary In 1950, when Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson ascended to the helm of the worldwide Chabad-Lubavitch movement, Hodakov became his Chief-of-Staff and head of his secretariat. He was later appointed chairman of Agudas Chasidei Chabad, the umbrella organization that oversees the worldwide network of Chabad-Lubavitch organizations and institutions. Hodakov innovated many educational ideas and programs. His advice is compiled in a book on education entitled \\"The Educator's Handbook.\\" He was a role model for many young Chassidim in his demeanor and in his devotion to the Rebbe. Hodakov gave much thought to spiritual conditions in the Land of Israel and sent constant directives to the Lubavitch School Network in Israel (Reshet Oholei Yosef Yitzchok – Lubavitch) and other institutions there. Death He died on April 23, 1993, after a brief illness. The funeral, which was held on Sunday, April 25, was attended by several thousand people, many of whom had managed to fly in from various parts of the United States. The procession filed past Lubavitch World Headquarters in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, and proceeded to the Montefiore Cemetery, in Springfield Gardens, New York. He was interred near the resting place of the previous Rebbe. His wife, Etel Tzerna, a noted educator and author, died on June 17, 2006. They are survived by two children: son Sholom Yisroel and daughter Chaya Rivkah Kramer, and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

The song was originally performed by Mina and Alberto Lupo. Original version The lyrics were written by Leo Chiosso and Giancarlo Del Re, the authors of the Italian Teatro 10 series of TV variety nights. The music and the score were by Gianni Ferrio, the conductor of the \\"Teatro 10\\" orchestra. In Spring 1972, the song was the closing number of all eight of the \\"Teatro 10\\" Saturday nights. The song is an easy listening dialogue of Mina's singing with Alberto Lupo's declamation. The song's theme are hollow words. It intertwines the female singer's lamentation of the end of love and the lies she has to hear, while the male actor simply speaks. She reacts and scoffs at the compliments that he gives her, calling them simply empty words – parole. The single was released in April 1972 under PDU, Mina's independent record label to become a top hit in Italian charts. The song was also published as one of the standout tracks of Mina's Cinquemilaquarantatrè albumParole parole hitparadeitalia site. Retrieved 15 August 2007 and included in the I'm Not Scared movie soundtrack.imdb.com International Movie Database. Retrieved 15 August 2007 Cover versions A parody version of \\"Parole parole\\" was performed by Adriano Celentano, Mina and Alberto Lupo on the penultimate \\"Teatro 10\\" show on 6 May 1972. In recent years the song became a part of the repertoire of Martina Feri accompanied by Gorni Kramer Quartet. In 1973, \\"Paroles... paroles...\\", with the lyrics translated into French by Michaële, was performed by Dalida with Alain Delon and published by Polydor. The track became a hit in France, Japan, Mexico (#3 - 12 May 1973) and Canada. On France 2's 1996 New Year's Eve programme, Alain Delon performed French cover of the song again, but this time in duet with Céline Dion, in the tribute for Dalida. In 2001, again for tributing Dalida, the French cover was remixed by the participants of the first edition of Star Academy France. Dalida also released a German version together with Friedrich Schütter in 1973, titled \\"Worte, nur Worte\\", and again recorded the song in 1983, with Harald Juhnke, which was released under the same title.Dalida Official Website Actress and singer Carmen Sevilla released a Spanish language version with the also actor Francisco \\"Paco\\" Rabal titled \\"Palabras Palabras\\" (literally \\"Parole Parole\\"). There is a Hungarian version from 1970s performed by Viktória Vincze and popular actor Sándor Lukács. Vicky Leandros released a German version with the actor Ben Becker on her album Zeitlos (Timeless) in 2010 which is called \\"Gerede Gerede\\" (\\"Talk Talk\\"). \\"Amai Sasayaki\\", the song in Japanese, was recorded by actor Toshiyuki Hosokawa and the female singer Akiko Nakamura in 1973. Two Spanish versions were recorded, one by singer Silvana di Lorenzo and another by Lupita D'Alessio and actor Jorge Vargas. D'Alessio and Vargas were married at the time and had a rocky relationship. Portuguese versions were recorded in 1972, translated as Palavras, palavras, in Brazil sung by Maysa with actor Raul Cortez, and in Portugal, with the title \\"Parole Parole\\" sung by Tonicha with actor João Perry. Two Dutch translations were made in 1973. The first one in Belgium, by Nicole and Hugo : \\"Die woorden, die woorden\\" (\\"Those words, those words\\"). The second Dutch translation was made in the Netherlands by author Cees Nooteboom, entitled \\"Gebabbel\\" (\\"Chatter\\"). It was performed by Liesbeth List and Ramses Shaffy. This version was parodied in 1992 by Dutch comedian Paul de Leeuw and female singer Willeke Alberti. Their version was a major hit in The Netherlands, reaching number 2 in the Top 40. A Turkish version was recorded by the Turkish singer and actress, Ajda Pekkan in 1973. Ajda sang the song (\\"Palavra palavra\\") with voice actor Cüneyt Türel, who added a funny touch to the song through his alterations to the spoken parts. In 2010 another version of the song was recorded by famous Turkish pop singers Göksel and Teoman. Japanese jazz pianist Shigeo Sekito recorded an instrumental electronic version on his 1975 funk album Special Sound Series Vol. 2. A Slovenian version was recorded by Slovenian singer Elda Viler with the Slovenian actor Boris Cavazza, titled Besede, Besede on her album Elda in 1982.

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks. WZRB's offices and transmitter are located on Cushman Drive (near US 1) on the northeast side of Columbia. On cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum channel 13 in both standard and high definition. History =Early history= The station first signed on the air on January 1, 2005, as the sixth commercial television station to sign on the air in the Columbia television market. Founded by St. Louis-based Roberts Broadcasting, it originally operated as a UPN affiliate. Prior to WZRB's sign-on, Sumter- licensed WB affiliate WBHQ (channel 63, now WKTC) carried UPN programming on a secondary basis, airing its prime time schedule on a two-hour delay. UPN programming was not available at all in the Columbia market for a few months after WBHQ dropped its secondary affiliation with UPN in August 2004. On January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks' respective programming to create a new \\"fifth\\" network called The CW.'Gilmore Girls' meet 'Smackdown'; CW Network to combine WB, UPN in CBS- Warner venture beginning in September, CNNMoney.com, January 24, 2006.UPN and WB to Combine, Forming New TV Network, The New York Times, January 24, 2006. WZRB became Columbia's CW affiliate when the network launched on September 18, 2006; WKTC took the MyNetworkTV affiliation, and joined that network when it launched two weeks earlier on September 5. =Sale to Gary Chapman and switch to Ion= On December 2, 2013, Roberts filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to sell WZRB to Radiant Light Ministries, a subsidiary of religious broadcaster Tri-State Christian Television; however, on December 11, the United States bankruptcy court gave initial approval for a plan by Roberts' creditors to instead transfer WZRB and its sister stations, WRBU in St. Louis and WAZE-LP in Evansville, Indiana, to a trust overseen by former LIN Media CEO Gary Chapman with Ion Media Networks (a creditor in Roberts' Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings) as its beneficiary, with Roberts' attorney subsequently stating that Ion would purchase the three stations. On February 10, 2014, WZRB became an Ion Television affiliate, carry the network's programming for the majority of its broadcast day, resulting in the removal of WZRB's syndicated programming inventory in the process. For the first month of its tenure as an Ion O&O;, CW programming—including primetime shows—continued to air on the station as a secondary affiliation, pre-empting one hour of Ion's daytime lineup and the first two hours of its primetime schedule (although the Vortexx children's block on Saturday mornings, was aired one hour earlier than the network's recommended timeslot nationwide, at 6:00 a.m. in order to accommodate Ion programming that started at 11:00 a.m.). This was a departure from the standard Ion programming structure (in which stations carry only Ion programming with limited to no local content and no acquired programming outside of that offered by the network); as a result, it marked the first time since 2008, the end of a two-year period in which Ion Media Networks ran MyNetworkTV programming on select i/Ion owned-and-operated stations, that the company had carried another network's programming on its stations. This arrangement proved to be only temporary, as existing MyNetworkTV affiliate WKTC took the CW affiliation on March 17, 2014, resulting in WZRB beginning to carry the entire Ion Television schedule. =Aborted sale to Brian Brady; sale to Ion Media Networks= On January 29, 2015, Cedar Creek Broadcasting (a company controlled by Brian Brady, who also owns several other broadcasting companies such as Northwest Broadcasting) agreed to purchase WZRB and WRBU from the trust for $6 million; following the deal's completion, Ion would have continued to provide services to the stations, and they would continue to be Ion affiliates. On May 9, 2017, the Broadcast Trust informed the FCC that the sale to Cedar Creek Broadcasting had been terminated. One month later on June 20, 2017, Ion Media Networks announced that it would purchase WZRB and WRBU from the Chapman-owned/Ion- managed trust for an undisclosed amount. The sale was completed on October 19, 2017.Consummation Notice Digital television Because it was granted an original construction permit after the FCC finalized the DTV allotment plan on April 21, 1997, , the station did not receive a companion channel for a digital television station. Instead, during the week of January 19, 2009, before February 17, 2009, which was the end of the digital television conversion period for most full-service stations, WZRB turned off its analog signal and turned on its digital signal (called a \\"flash- cut\\").http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdfList of Broadcast Stations (A-I) Going Digital On February 17, 2009, About.com On March 29, 2011, WZRB's license was initially canceled by the FCC for failure to file for either a license to cover or an extension of its digital construction permit (the license for sister station WRBJ-TV in Jackson, Mississippi was initially canceled for the same reasons two days later). However, Roberts Broadcasting filed an appeal, stating that the licenses to cover were improperly filed upon the digital transition. The FCC agreed, and reinstated the licenses of the two stations on April 19. Roberts had to file for new licenses to cover. WZRB's high definition feed is not currently carried by AT&T; U-verse in the area; however, it is carried by Charter Spectrum, Dish Network and DirecTV.

He is notable for being one of the first professionals of African descent in these fields in the United States. Viro Small was born into slavery in Buford, South Carolina in 1854. He gained his freedom at the end of the American Civil War and moved north. Career Viro Small's career as a boxer began in 1870. There is debate over whether his wrestling career started at this point or later in 1881. The match in 1881 was a collar-and-elbow match against Mike Horogan as a substitute for another wrestler. While he lost, Horogan was very impressed with Small's ability and agreed to train him. Viro Small's career began to take off after this. Wrestling under the name Black Sam, out of St. Albans and Rutland, Vermont, Small won 63 matches between 1882 and 1892 and the Vermont Collar and Elbow Championship twice. These wins made him possibly the first champion of African descent in the United States, but there are conflicting accounts and competing claims to this distinction. These titles also gave Small the chance to travel in the county fair circuits in New England. At the fairs, Small and Horogan would team up for various shows. Horogan would challenge members of the audience to get into the ring with Small and the volunteer could win money if he lasted a certain amount of time in the ring. Small moved to New York City and wrestled in some of the toughest parts of the city, including at a tavern named Bastille of the Bowery, owned by former boxer Owney Geoghegan. The bar contained two rings for boxing and wrestling contests, and was notorious for crooked management, rowdy patrons and an overall seedy atmosphere. Geoghegan reportedly won a decision over an opponent in the Bowery by having his henchmen aim a gun at the referee's head after the fight. On September 3, 1882 at Bowery, Small had a match with Billy McCallum that ended in a no-contest after a major argument started between them. Upset by the fight, McCallum attempted to murder Small later that evening while he was sleeping, shooting Small in the neck, but Small survived. Other frequent opponents in New York included Captain James C. Daley, Harry Woodson, and Joe Ryan. Small's last recorded match took place in 1885.

It is named after the Pus river. Its ancient name was 'Pushpawanti'.  History  = Early era= Lambani Banjara woman in traditional attire. Pusad is a tribal area, of mostly Banjaras. Banjara of Pusad area have an oral tradition of their migration from Rajasthan toward central and south India from 12th century after the defeat and death of Prithviraj Chauhan by Muhammad Ghouri in the 1191 Battle of Tarain in present- day Haryana, a narrative which also coincides with the oral traditions of Romani gypsies of Europe who also recall 12th century Islamic invasion of India as the cause of their migration.V. Hari Saravanan, 2014, Gods, Heroes, and their Story Tellers: Intangible cultural. = Medieval era= Two temples in 13th century hemadpanti architecture, ruins of several temples, a fine tank exist in Pusad area as per the ASI report of 1874 CE.Archaeological Survey of Western India: Reports. Old series, ASI, Volumes 1-8, page 48. During 16 to 20th century Pusad was part of Berar Province which kept changing hands between Maratha Peshwas and Mughals. During 1760 and 1795 this area was with Maratha Bhonsla rajas of Nagpur kingdom. Marathas ceded these to British after Wellesley's victories at Assaye and Argaon (1803), who in turn handed these over to Nizam-ul-Mulk of Hyderabad State in 1804. After this Pindari and Bhil raiders too stopped their harassing raids in this area. Nizam was initially a viceroy of Hydrabad province of Mughal Empire, from 1724 CE he ruled this area independently until he came under British protectorate, after 1857 he gradually became a princely state of the British raj. = British era= Central Provinces and its Berar Division in 1903 During British raj's Great Trigonometrical Survey (1802-1871), to install and maintain measuring marker stones, the Bittergaon and Sukli villages in Pusad area were visited regularly including in 1868 and 1873.Synopsis of the Results of the Operations, Great Trigonometrical Survey, Volume 8. Washim to Pusad road through Penganga reserve was constructed around 1878.1878, Report on the Hyderabad assigned districts, Berar province report, page 31. In 1853, the administration of the Berar province was assigned to the British East India Company by the Nizam following a treaty. It was divided into two districts each headed by a deputy commissioner, South Berar with its headquarters at Hingoli, and North Berar with its headquarters at Buldana. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Hingoli and its adjoining areas [including Pusad] were restored to the Nizam and the province was reconstituted into two districts, East Berar with its headquarters at Amravati, and West Berar with its headquarters at Akola. In 1903 Berar Province became the Berar Division of Central Provinces. In 1936 these were renamed as Central Provinces and Berar. =Independent India= In 1950 when the Constitution of India came into effect, Pusad as part of the Central Provinces & Berar was merged with the newly formed state of Madhya Pradesh. In 1956, under pressure from Marathi Irredentists, the Berar and Nagpur divisions were transferred to Bombay state. In 1960, the Bombay State was partitioned into Maharashtra & Gujarat.Markovits, Claude (ed.) (2004). A History of Modern India: 1480-1950.

Geography  = Topography = Just north of Pusad hills is the Buldhana- Yavatmal plateau, itself part of the bigger deccan plateau, extends from Penganga valley of Pusad region in south, to the Purna valley of Ajanta range of Marathwada in north, and to Wardha valley in the east. It covers the southern parts of districts of Akola, Buldhana and Yavatmal. Highest elevation of 600–900 m is found in Buldhana and Chikhuli, 450–600 m in south around Pusad, 300–450 m sloping escarpment (steep cliff) towards Purna and Wardha river valleys in north and east respectively. The edges and interior of this plateau are jagged and littered with series of hills and valleys. Hills are mostly \\"flat topped\\" (eroded former larger plateau) with sharp drops, trappean in structure, made of basalt, gradually sloping in the west but uneven in the east. Slopes are steep, dry, without many plants or trees. Further north of Ajanta range is \\"Amravati plateau\\" which extends till Gawilghur hill range.Prabha Shastri Ranade, 1990, Population Dynamics in India, Ashish Publication, Delhi. = Hydology = The town is located on the south and western banks of the \\"Pus river\\".

Written by Diane Ruggiero and directed by Michael Fields, the episode premiered on UPN on October 19, 2004. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica helps Wallace's (Percy Daggs III) new girlfriend, Georgia, when she is cheated out of $6,000 in a confidence scam by the \\"Silicon Mafia\\". Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring) makes a video memorial of Lilly (Amanda Seyfried) for a memorial ceremony at the school to dedicate a fountain in her name.  Plot  Veronica and Troy (Aaron Ashmore) are kissing outside of her house and asks her to the homecoming dance. After they say goodbye, Veronica goes in and playfully confronts Keith (Enrico Colantoni) about tracking Troy. He denies it. In a flashback, Lilly helps Veronica pick out a dress for homecoming. The next day, Wallace and his new friend Georgia (Kyla Pratt) talk to Veronica about starting an investigation—Georgia has received an email from a stranger, Karl, requesting money to help out with a gambling problem. Georgia reveals that she actually gave him the money, but he is late on paying it back. Veronica attempts to catch the person in a disguise. Later, Troy invites Veronica on a date, and she accepts his invitation to the dance. In another flashback, Logan, Duncan (Teddy Dunn), Lilly, and Veronica pose for pictures before the same dance the previous year. Veronica soon receives a call from Karl. At the meeting, Georgia does not recognize the man (Alexander Scarlis) who appears. They decide to meet back tomorrow after Veronica doesn't have the money in cash. After, Veronica confronts the man and finds out that the man's real name is Jimmy Spain, who has played a role named \\"Karl\\" in another supposed \\"project.\\" After the show, Karl comes up to her and attempts to con her, after which she questions him. He reveals that he is actually taking part in a reality show called \\"Duped!\\" in which he and others con people while it is all being caught on camera. Veronica tells him it is a scam, and he gives her the phone number of the people who auditioned him. Wallace tells her it is the number of a video game club. Veronica walks into the club in full costume. Veronica soon finds a gamer's username which matches the email address (\\"Grrrantastic\\"). Veronica takes \\"Grrrantastic\\"'s ID and figures out that he is a college student at San Diego State University. Afterwards, Veronica talks with Wallace while they are preparing for a fake college interview, who tells her that he has a crush on Georgia. In a flashback, Veronica, Logan, Duncan, and Lilly play Truth or Dare?. Wallace and Veronica are taken to an SDSU party, where the host tells them that \\"Grrrantastic\\" (Grant) and one other person, Liam, are known as the \\"Silicon Mafia.\\" Veronica snatches the key to the partners' room, and she also posts the picture of the actor on the wall. Both instances prove a connection between the \\"Mafia\\" and Georgia. The next day, Veronica finds Logan looking at old videos of Lilly while assembling a memorial video. In a flashback, the group plays Never Have I Ever. Veronica's statement is that she has never gone skinny dipping. Keith forcibly works his way into the \\"Silicon Mafia\\" 's lair, although his real objective is to plant an audio recorder, which he does. Veronica finds out the passcode to their alarm system. Meanwhile, Keith and Troy have an awkward talk, during which Keith tells Troy that he cancelled his surprise reservation for Veronica at the Four Seasons. Keith traps the \\"Mafia\\" by telling them that he will give them an advance screening of a new game. After the distraction is complete, Veronica sneaks into the dorm. She reveals in a voiceover that they are making money off a video game they are creating through conning people. She completely disassembles their console. The two come back and see that Veronica has completely foiled their plan and escaped. They then pay the money back in exchange for knowledge of where their equipment is. Georgia kisses Wallace. At Lilly's memorial service, Celeste (Lisa Thornhill) makes a speech before the fountain is revealed and the video plays. However, at the end of the video, Logan has put footage of the chaotic night of the dance, which the students enjoy. Afterwards, Weevil (Francis Capra) is shown to be crying. The night of the homecoming dance, Veronica stops the car and goes skinny dipping, fulfilling her promise made to Lilly on the corresponding night in the past.  Arc significance  * Weevil cries after Lilly's video memorial is shown.  Production  This episode was actress Kristen Bell's favorite episode as of 2006.

Club, praised the episode. He notes that the episode contained the \\"single moment when Veronica Mars got its claws into me\\". He also stated that \\"[t]here was comedy, drama, ridiculousness, and important character beats yes, but there was also a driving momentum that screamed 'Veronica Mars can be a great show!' \\" Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave the episode a mixed review. He stated that while Lilly \\"seemed kind of obnoxious,\\" the scene at the end of the episode was a \\"truly memorable and touching moment.\\" Sally Tamarkin, writing for Slate, praised the episode and said that it got the viewer hooked on the show. \\" 'The Wrath of Con' showcases Veronica’s most salient qualities: her fierce loyalty to friends, her commitment to fairness and justice, and her wisecracking badassedness.\\" The reviewer went on to state that \\" 'The Wrath of Con' is illustrative of a couple of other things that make the show great. Veronica Mars routinely plumbs emotional depths while avoiding cringey sentimentality. Veronica’s relationship with her dad and her BFF-ship with Wallace are tender but not uncomplicated, and the sweetness of the moments they share are cut with humor.\\" Author Rhonda Wilcox notes the \\"I never\\" game flashback in which Duncan and Veronica admit to being virgins, and the dream sequences from this episode in her discussions of the show. John Ramos, writing in Neptune Noir: Unauthorized Investigations Into Veronica Mars, notes the episode as one where Keith has lied to aid Veronica. The episode has been referenced in multiple graduate theses.

Thus citizenship is conferred primarily by birth to a Dutch parent, irrespective of place of birth. Children born in the Netherlands to two foreign parents do not acquire Dutch citizenship at birth, unless special criteria are met. Despite the existence of four countries in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, only one category of citizen is distinguished in Dutch nationality law (Nederlandse burgers). The Kingdom Act on the Netherlands nationality was significantly amended with effect from 1 April 2003. A minor revision concerning people born before 1985 to a Dutch mother went into effect on 1 January 2011. Acquisition of citizenship =By descent or automatic acquisition of Dutch nationality= A person born on or after 1 January 1985 to a Dutch father or mother (afstamming) is automatically a Dutch national at birth (van rechtswege). It is irrelevant where the child is born. A child born to an unmarried Dutch father and a non-Dutch mother must be acknowledged by the Dutch father before birth, in order for the child to be a Dutch national at birth. Before 1 April 2003, an acknowledgement could be given after birth. Since then children who were not acknowledged before birth may nonetheless acquire Dutch citizenship through the option procedure, or through obtaining proof of paternity from a court. In the last case, the child gets Dutch nationality retroactively since the child's birth. From 1 January 1985 the Kingdom Act on the Netherlands nationality (Rijkswet op het Nederlanderschap 19 December 1984, Stb. 628) permits children of either a Dutch father or mother to receive Dutch nationality by descent. Prior to that date Dutch nationality law (Wet op het Nederlanderschap en het ingezetenenschap (commonly abbreviated as WNI, 12 December 1892, Stb. 268) did not permit children to obtain Dutch nationality through descent from a Dutch mother (through matrilineal descent) and a non-Dutch father. Netherlands nationality was only passed through patrilineal (father) descent. Only if the father was not known or acknowledged did a child born to a Dutch mother receive Dutch nationality prior to 1 January 1985. Between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 1987 children born after 1 January 1964 but before 1 January 1985 of a Dutch mother and non- Dutch father and who had never been married could use the ‘option procedure’ to acquire Dutch nationality. This possibility was not widely known and many in this situation missed the temporary opportunity to register themselves or their children as Dutch nationals.Article: 'Nee mevrouw, u bent te laat' by Karin Alfenaar, de Verdieping Trouw Nieuws, 13 May 2006. In 2004, a number of these children of Dutch mothers and non-Dutch fathers (so-called \\"latent Dutch\\" or \\"latente Nederlanders\\") began to organise themselves in the hope of persuading the Dutch government that Article 27 of Rijkswet op het Nederlanderschap condones the discrimination against women enshrined in the earlier Dutch Nationality Law (before its 1985 revision), and it should therefore be revoked. In 2005, several Dutch lawyers agreed to take on the case and formalised the group into “Stichting Ne(e)derlanderschap Ja!”.Article: De latente Nederlanders.

However, while latent Dutch are by definition descended from a Dutch mother, nationality granted through the option procedure is not retroactive to the date of their birth. Under the law, these individuals are not considered to be Dutch since birth (van rechtswege), but rather are legally ‘Dutch by option’ from the date that the requirements of the ‘option procedure’ are fulfilled. =By option= The option procedure is a simpler and quicker way of acquiring Dutch citizenship compared to naturalisation. In effect, it is a form of simplified naturalisation. In order to be eligible for the option procedure, it is necessary to hold a Dutch residence permit and to be any of the following: * an adult who was born in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten and who has lived in any of these places continuously since birth. * a person born in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten who has lived in any of these places for an uninterrupted period of at least three years and who has not acquired the citizenship of any other country (a stateless person). * an adult who has been legally resident in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten since he or she was four years old. * an adult who used to be a Dutch national and who has been legally resident in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten for at least one year and whose residence is without any restriction as to length. * someone who has been married to a Dutch national for at least three years and who has been legally resident in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten for an uninterrupted period of at least fifteen years. * someone aged sixty-five years or over and who has been legally resident in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten for an uninterrupted period of at least fifteen years. * a minor who is acknowledged by a Dutch national who has been cared for and brought up by this Dutch national for an uninterrupted period of at least three years. * a minor who, as a result of a Court decision or by law at the time of his or her birth, is under the joint custody of a non-Dutch parent and another person who is a Dutch national and who, since the start of this custody, has been cared for and brought up by this Dutch national for a period of at least three years during which the child has had his or her principal place of residence in the Netherlands. Exception: Legislation 31.813 (R1873),Legislation 31.813 (R1873) amendments to the Kingdom Act on the Netherlands Nationality inter alia, amends the Kingdom of the Netherlands' nationality law to allow latent Dutch to opt to receive Dutch nationality, effective 1 October 2010.Article: Hoe Bepaal je je wwn latente Nederlander Bent? How do you determine whether you are Latent Dutch? Radio Nederland Wereldomroep (in Dutch) The conditions of eligibility through the 'option procedure' differ somewhat from those described above. Eligibility criteria for Dutch nationality as a latent Dutch person are that the:Staatscourant, published 30 June 2010, Sections 6.1.i through 6.1.o # applicant was born before 1 January 1985; # mother was a Dutch national when the applicant was born; # father was not a Dutch national when the applicant was born; # applicant did not obtain Dutch nationality between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 1987 through the option procedure and then subsequently lost that Dutch nationality; and # applicant has no criminal record. All five conditions must be met. If one or more of the conditions are not met the person is ineligible for nationality by this particular means under the recent changes to the option procedure affecting the latent Dutch. Residency in the Netherlands is not an eligibility requirement for latent Dutch applicants. Applicants for Dutch citizenship through the option procedure are not required by Dutch law to renounce any foreign citizenship they might hold. However, the laws pertaining to their other citizenship may disagree. =Jus soli= Jus soli is the right of anyone born in the territory of a state to nationality or citizenship of that state. Dutch law has no provisions for the automatic granting of the Dutch nationality based on the actual place of birth, however a child is Dutch if it was born to at least one parent, having his or her main residence in the Netherlands, Curaçao, Sint Maarten or Aruba (or the Netherlands Antilles) at the times of the births of that parent and of the child, provided the child itself has at birth its main residence in one of those countries too.Article 3(3) of the Netherlands Nationality Act. A child found on Dutch territory (including ships and airplanes with Dutch nationality), whose parents are unknown, is considered Dutch by birth if within five years since being found it does not become apparent that the child had another citizenship by birth. =By naturalisation= An application for Dutch citizenship by naturalisation must meet all the conditions below: * Aged eighteen or over; * Holder of a permanent resident permit or a valid residence permit with a non-temporary reason of stay (notably family formation or reunion gezinsvorming or gezinshereniging); * Five years of continuous residence in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, or Sint Maarten with a valid residence permit prior to the application date. Residency under a temporary reason of stay (notably study) is also counted in those five years. There are a number of exceptions to this rule. * Sufficiently integrated in Dutch society and are able to read, write, speak and understand Dutch. This must normally be proven by taking a naturalisation test. Successful completion of an eligible integration course is an alternative. The Staatsexamen Nederlands als Tweede Taal diplomas NT2-I or NT2-II give their holder exemption from taking the naturalisation test. There are many other exemptions, see the Decision naturalisation test (Besluit naturalisatietoets) art. 3. * In the five years preceding the application, the applicant has not been given any custodial sentence, training order, community service order or high monetary penalty. Since 1 March 2009, anyone who requests naturalization must take an oath promising adherence to the values of the Dutch state: \\"I swear (declare) that I respect the constitutional order of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, its freedoms and its rights, and I swear (promise) to faithfully fulfil the obligations due to my nationality. So help me God Almighty\\", or: \\"This is what I promise and declare.\\"Law on introducing the declaration of allegiance and for adapting the rule of obtaining the Netherlands nationality after recognition, 27 June 2008, Art. 1.H.2. According to Art. 23.3. of the Kingdom Act on the Netherlands Nationality,Rijkswet op het Nederlanderschap Art. 23 onder 3. some categories of people are excepted from declaring their allegiance, through a general administrative measure. According to Art. 60a.6. of the Decree regarding the Obtention and Loss of the Netherlands Nationality,Besluit verkrijging en verlies Nederlanderschap Art. 60a onder 6. persons with a physical or psychical handicap who are unable to state their allegiance are exempted from doing so. Exemptions to the residence requirement The five-year residence requirement may not apply where the applicant falls into any of the following categories: * a person adopted after majority in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, or Sint Maarten by parents at least one of whom has Dutch nationality. * married to or are the registered partner of a Dutch man or Dutch woman. If this is the case, the person can submit an application for naturalisation after three years of marriage or registered partnership and cohabitation. If the person has cohabited in the Netherlands with a Dutch man or Dutch woman (both partners unmarried) for an uninterrupted period of three years, an application may also be submitted. Note: this is true in respect to marriage, partnership or cohabitation if and only if in the last three years the applicant has continually lived together with the partner inside the Netherlands. As a rule of thumb, for each passed year, more than six months per year must have been spent under the same roof with that partner. There is an extra clause, namely that the couple has to remain living under the same roof for as long as the request for naturalization is being researched. * the five-year term is reduced to a three-year term if the applicant is stateless. * the five-year term is reduced to a three-year term if the applicant as a minor is acknowledged or legitimised by a Dutch national and has been cared for and brought up by this Dutch national for a period of 3 years. * the five-year term is reduced to a two-year term if the applicant has legally lived in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, or Sint Maarten for a period of ten years, the last two of which uninterruptedly. * a former Dutch national. In some cases the applicant will instead be able to use the option procedure. Exemptions to the requirement to renounce foreign citizenship An applicant for naturalisation does not have to give up his current nationality in the following cases:Exceptions Ind.nl. * where the original nationality is automatically lost upon naturalisation as a Dutch national * the legislation of the applicant's country does not allow renunciation of nationality. * the person is married to or the registered partner of a Dutch national. * recognised refugees. * born in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, or Sint Maarten, and still living there at the time of application. * where the applicant cannot be expected to contact the authorities in the country of which they are a national. * where the applicant has \\"special and objectively assessable reasons\\" for not renouncing his existing nationality. * where, in order to give up the current nationality, the applicant would have to fulfil military service obligations or pay for such military service instead of fulfilling it. This must be demonstrated in each case. * where renunciation of the applicant's existing nationality would cause \\"serious financial losses\\" (for example, inheritance rights). This must be demonstrated.A peculiar case of \\"serious financial losses\\" is in the case where renunciation of the applicant's existing nationality would cost too much in respect to income. See the following footnote for explanations. * where, in order to give up the applicant's current nationality, the applicant must pay a large sum of money to the authorities in his or her country.This must be demonstrated with proof of income and proof of consular fees to be paid in case of renunciation, specific to the applicant's own case or with general specifications of such consular fees for every national of that country. Note: As a rule of thumb, if that sum of money is larger than twice the applicant's monthly income, they have a right to keep their nationality of origin. Loans do not count as income. A testimony of this process is shown at Commons:Image:RWN Exception 1 d.jpg. That document is a sworn Dutch translation of a proof of consular fees from the head of the Consular Section of the Romanian Embassy in the Hague. Since the sum of 515 Euro was greater than his income for two months (excluding a study loan from IB Groep), the national naturalized by the decision of Her Majesty the Queen was allowed to retain his Romanian nationality. Such exemption had to be explained in advance to the naturalization clerk of the municipality, who filled then the naturalization request papers accordingly. These exemptions do not hold for Austrian, Danish and Norwegian nationals, since these countries (together with the Netherlands) are parties to the Convention on the Reduction of Cases of Multiple Nationality and on Military Obligations in Cases of Multiple Nationality (see Chapter I, art. 1, paragraph 1). This was also the case for Belgian nationals until 28 April 2008, since Belgium denounced Chapter 1 of this treaty on such date. In a similar way, this was also the case for Luxembourgish nationals until 10 July 2009. Children Children aged under eighteen may be added to a parent's application for Dutch citizenship. Those aged sixteen and seventeen will only be naturalised if they give their active consent while those aged twelve through fifteen inclusive are given a chance to object. =By resumption= Former Dutch nationals who hold permanent resident permits and have resided in the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, or Sint Maarten) for at least one year may regain Dutch citizenship through the option procedure. Where the person is not resident in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the person must have lost Dutch citizenship after reaching the age of majority and through the acquisition of another citizenship. In addition one of the following conditions must be satisfied: * born in the country whose nationality was acquired and living there at the time of acquisition of the nationality of that country, or * before turning eighteen, lived in the country whose nationality was acquired for an uninterrupted period of at least five years, or * at the time of acquisition of the nationality of the other country, the person was married to someone who possessed that nationality. These criteria are similar to the criteria for exemption from loss of Dutch citizenship in place since 1 April 2003. If a former Dutch national lost Dutch nationality prior to 31 March 2003 under one of the three conditions above, that individual may submit an application to regain Dutch nationality through option. The application opting for Dutch nationality may be submitted up to 31 March 2013 (i.e., ten years from the 2003 change in the law). Loss of Dutch citizenship Dutch nationals may lose their citizenship through long residence outside the Netherlands while having more than one nationality, or acquisition of a foreign nationality. In addition, in some cases it is possible to be deprived of Dutch citizenship. =By residence outside the Netherlands= The Dutch law has contained for many years provisions that removed Dutch citizenship from certain Dutch persons who held another nationality at birth and remained resident outside the Netherlands in adulthood. Prior to 1985 Before 1 January 1985, Dutch nationals lost their nationality in cases where they were born outside the Kingdom of the Netherlands, lived for an uninterrupted period of ten years outside the Kingdom after reaching the age of majority (then twenty-one) and did not submit notification that they wished to retain their Dutch nationality before the period of ten years. These provisions affected Dutch nationals born abroad before 1 January 1954. 1985–2003 Under the 1985 legislation, Dutch nationals born outside the Netherlands who also held the nationality of the country of their birth lost Dutch citizenship if they lived in the country of their birth for ten years after they turn 18 (and were still citizens or nationals of their country of birth). Those who were issued a Dutch passport or proof of Dutch citizenship on or after 1 January 1990 are deemed never to have lost Dutch citizenship. This exemption was put in place on 1 February 2001. Former nationals who were not issued a Dutch passport or proof of Dutch citizenship in 1990 or later were given a limited period of time to acquire Dutch citizenship by option, until 31 March 2005. Since 2003 Since 1 April 2003, following an amendment to the Netherlands Nationality Act of 1985, Dutch nationals with dual nationality will lose their Dutch citizenship if they hold a foreign citizenship and reside outside the Kingdom of the Netherlands or the European Union for ten years. In the case of Dutch nationals who possessed dual nationality on 1 April 2003 and who were then resident outside the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the European Union, the ten years started on 1 April 2003. The amendment lets Dutch nationals who hold foreign citizenship and reside abroad keep their citizenship by either having a principal residence in the Netherlands or another EU member state for at least a year or applying for a Dutch passport or proof of Dutch nationality before 1 April 2013, the end of the ten years. A new period of ten years starts on the day that the person is issued with a passport or proof of Dutch nationality. =By acquisition of another citizenship= A person over the age of majorityhttp://eudo- citizenship.eu/NationalDB/docs/NL%20Netherlands%20Nationality%20Act%20as%20of%201%20January%201985%20(refworld,%20English).pdf Chapter 15 who voluntarily acquired another citizenship before 1 April 2003 automatically lost Dutch citizenship. From 1 April 2003, loss of Dutch citizenship upon naturalisation in another country is still automatic unless at least one of the following exemptions applies:Acquiring a different nationality. Dutch Department of Foreign Affairs. * the person is born in the country of the other nationality and has a principal residence there at the time of acquisition of that nationality. * if before turning 18, the person has had a principal residence in the country of the other nationality for an uninterrupted period of five years; * if the person is married to a living person who possesses the nationality that the former person wishes to acquire. If a person already lost Dutch nationality under these three exceptions prior to 1 April 2003, the final date to regain Dutch nationality under these three exceptions was 1 April 2013. Since then, it is no longer possible to reacquire Dutch nationality by option under these three exceptions if the person had already lost Dutch nationality prior to 1 April 2003. The only way to regain Dutch nationality is by naturalisation. These exemptions do not apply in the case of acquisition of Austrian, Norwegian or Danish citizenship. Before 28 April 2008, those exemptions did not apply to obtaining Belgian nationality. Before 10 July 2009, these exemptions did not apply to getting the Luxembourgeois nationality. This is due to the provisions of the Convention on the Reduction of Cases of Multiple Nationality, to which the Netherlands became party in 1985. Other exceptions also exist such as the one in which minors who naturalise independently from their parents will not lose their Dutch citizenship. That was particularly helpful prior to 1985, when the age of majority was 21. The exemptions lead to internal problems in the case of acquisition of Japanese or South Korean citizenship since neither Japan nor South Korea allows its nationals to hold foreign citizenships in their adult years (though limited exceptions exist in South Korea, and Japan requires renunciation of the foreign citizenship within two years).See Japanese and South Korean nationality laws. They are strictly Japanese or South Korean internal affairs and have to be solved by Japanese or South Korean citizens themselves, according to the laws of their own country. They are not problems of the Dutch state, and all that the Dutch laws say in this respect is that such Dutch nationals with dual nationality are allowed to renounce to their Dutch nationality.Nederlandse nationaliteit, afstand doen. Haarlemmermeer municipality. Dutch nationals are not allowed to renounce their nationality if they become stateless so this renunciation has to occur while they have dual nationality, which is illegal in Japan and South Korea. Therefore, acquiring Japanese or South Korean nationality cannot be done by exempted Dutch nationals without breaking the laws of such countries. Each sovereign state decides for itself who are its citizens, and other states are not allowed to intercede on behalf of individuals in such internal affairs.Ook Beatrix heeft dubbele nationaliteit. Radio Nederland Wereldomroep. =By deprivation= Dutch citizenship by naturalization may be withdrawn if procured by fraud or if the naturalized Dutch national does not renounce a foreign citizenship as per the requirements for naturalization (if one did not have the right to be exempted from such requirement or if one did not claim one's right to such exemption before signing a paper wherein one agrees to renounce the original nationality). A similar requirement exists for citizens of Japan and South Korea (see above). Dutch citizenship may also be revoked in the case of service in a foreign army at war with the Netherlands. The possibility to reapply for lost Dutch nationality under those three exceptions expired on 31 March 2013. =By joining jihadist groups= On 29 August 2014, Dutch ministers, in their effort to discourage young Dutch Muslims from joining terrorist organisations involved in a war with the Netherlands or one of its allies, planned to increase the options of withdrawing Dutch citizenship from dual nationals. This will be extended to the people who train in terrorist camps or work in them as instructors. In addition, passports of people suspected of making plans to travel to a conflict zone and join a terrorist organisation like ISIL may be declared invalid. Dual citizenship Although Dutch law restricts dual citizenship, it is possible for Dutch nationals to legally hold dual citizenship in a number of circumstances, including: * those who acquire another citizenship at the time of birth (for example, a child born to Dutch parents in the United States would hold both US and Dutch citizenship). * persons who acquire Dutch citizenship through the option procedure (including former Dutch citizens resuming citizenship) * persons who become naturalised Dutch nationals if they obtain an exemption from the requirement to renounce their foreign citizenship, such as those who are married to Dutch nationals. * Dutch nationals who naturalise in another country who are exempted from the loss of nationality rule, such as those married to a national of that country. =Dispute= Dutch nationality law is an object of enduring dispute, dissension and debate, since the electoral campaign of Pim Fortuyn turned immigration into a hot issue in Dutch politics. Since the assassination of Pim Fortuyn, anti-immigration politicians like Geert Wilders and Rita Verdonk have opposed dual citizenship. Citizenship of the European Union Because the Netherlands forms part of the European Union, Dutch citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Dutch embassy, Dutch citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.Article 20(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.Rights abroad: Right to consular protection: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). Antigua and Barbuda (UK), Barbados (UK), Belize (UK), Central African Republic (France), Comoros (France), Gambia (UK), Guyana (UK), Liberia (Germany), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (UK), San Marino (Italy), São Tomé and Príncipe (Portugal), Solomon Islands (UK), Timor-Leste (Portugal), Vanuatu (France) Dutch citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty.  Impact of UK departure from EU  The consequences of the UK’s departure from the EU (Brexit) will impact Dutch nationals in the UK and British nationals in the Netherlands.https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2018/04/brexit-and-dual-nationality- centre-stage-as-campaigners-meet-dutch-mps/ This prospective loss of their original or dual nationality has encourage many to support the European Citizen’s Initiative for Permanent European Union Citizenship. Former territories Before independence, Dutch citizenship was held by many persons in Suriname and Indonesia. In general, those acquiring citizenship of these countries at independence have lost their Dutch citizenship, but a request for determination of citizenship status can be addressed to the Dutch authorities. Dutch citizenship statistics Figures from the Dutch government show that approximately 11,500 people were granted Dutch citizenship by naturalisation in the first six months of 2003. There were close to 20,000 applications. According to the country's statistics office , nearly 21,000 people were granted Dutch nationality through naturalisation in 2004 (13,000 adults and 8,000 children at the same time). This is 4,000 fewer than in 2003 and half the number in 2002. Travel freedom of Dutch citizens Visa requirements for Dutch citizens Visa requirements for Dutch citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of the Netherlands. In 2017, Dutch citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 173 countries and territories, ranking the Dutch nationality 4th in the world according to the Henley visa restrictions index. The Dutch nationality is ranked fourth in The Quality of Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Henley Passport Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers in addition to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, human development as well.

The ruling is notable because the court established that section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms requires that parents of the official-language minority in each province have the right either to be represented on the school board, or to have a school board of their own, in order to provide adequate protection for the education rights of their children. Background Three Edmonton citizens, Jean-Claude Mahe, Angeline Martel and Paul Dubé, were dissatisfied with the quality of the French language schools provided by the Alberta government. In 1982 they submitted a proposal to the Minister of Education for a new French elementary school that would be administered by a committee of parents within an autonomous French school board. The Minister of Education told them that it was not in their policy to make such arrangements and so they suggested they try to do it through the public school board. The board rejected them. Mahé and the others brought an action against the government of Alberta for violating their right to a Francophone-run education system under section 23 of the Charter. The questions before the Supreme Court were: # Have the rights of the Francophone population of Edmonton under section 23(2)(b) of the Charter been violated? # Do the rights under section 23 include the right to manage and control the schools? If so, what is the nature and extent of the management and control? # Does the provincial School Act violate section 23? If so, can it be saved under section 1 of the Charter? # Are the rights affected by section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867, section 29 of the Charter, and section 17 of the Alberta Act? Opinion of the Court The Court held that section 23 guarantees representation on the school board, and exclusive control over the children's education with respect to culture; or it can guarantee a separate school board. However, there must be sufficient minority language population to warrant either level of protection. In this particular case, the Court decided representation on an existing school board would be sufficient, and held that this did not interfere with denominational school rights under section 29 of the Charter since it merely affected language. The Court's unanimous decision was given by Chief Justice Brian Dickson. He began by examining the purpose of section 23 which is to \\"preserve and promote the two official languages of Canada, and their respective cultures\\". The section was intended to be remedial so as to prevent the loss of a minority group's language and cultural identity and so must be interpreted in light of section 15 and 27 of the Charter.

Written by Dayna Lynne North and directed by Nick Gomez, the episode premiered on UPN on October 26, 2004. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica goes on the case when her boyfriend Troy Vandegraff's (Aaron Ashmore) car goes missing and finds out some unpleasant information in the process.  Synopsis  The episode opens in Tijuana, Mexico. Luke (Sam Huntington), Troy, and Logan (Jason Dohring) go in a car and cross the U.S.-Mexico border. After stopping at a diner, they notice that their car is missing, which is actually Troy's father's car. However, Veronica pulls up and takes them back home. After returning home, Logan and Luke leave, while, Veronica offers to help Troy find his father's car, an offer which he eventually accepts. While Veronica searches for Troy's car, she playfully teases Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and talks to him about potential birthday presents for Keith (Enrico Colantoni). Later, Veronica checks her dad's voicemail and hears a message from school guidance counselor Rebecca James (Paula Marshall), with whom Keith had been dating. Meanwhile, Luke is being interrogated and threatened by Hank Zigman (Deron McBee). He tells them that he will have their \\"package,\\" which is in Troy's car, tomorrow. Veronica tells Keith that she's figured out about his relationship with Rebecca, and he says that he is enjoying it. The next day, Luke tells Veronica that there was a piñata of steroids in the backseat of the car and he needs to get it to Hank Zigman or he will punish Luke severely. Veronica reluctantly agrees to help him. Veronica goes to a bank and tells the teller about the safety deposit box key she found in her mom's old stuff. In it, Veronica finds many secret photos of herself. Later, Rebecca shows up to talk to Veronica \\"outside of school\\", and Veronica treats the idea with sarcasm. Luke is chased by the drug dealers. The next day, Veronica confronts Logan about his steroid plan. Veronica finds Rebecca in their kitchen, but Veronica says that she has to leave before Rebecca can actually make dinner. At the junkyard, Weevil talks to a worker, Angel, who says that Troy's car has already come and went. Veronica confronts Luke in the women's bathroom, and she tells him that he needs to collect $8,000 himself to pay Zigman back. Veronica sends disposable cell phones to Lianne's (Corrine Bohrer) friends and family in an effort to let her know that it is okay to call her. Later, Veronica requests her dad's help in finding Troy's car. He agrees if Veronica will be nice to Rebecca. The next day, Keith goes to the car tracking company and poses as a high-ranking executive. The boss reluctantly does a scan. Veronica hands her dad a background check she did on Rebecca, and she has a criminal record. This leads to an increasingly heated debate in which Veronica eventually brings up her mother. Veronica sobs after the argument settles down. Later, Veronica and Troy track the car, which they find is actually a tracker attached to a dog. The next day, Keith hands Veronica a background check he did on Troy. In addition, Keith tells Rebecca that they need to break up for Veronica's sake. Veronica confronts Troy about his past, which includes expulsion from two schools due to drug trafficking and possession. She also believes that he has something to do with the steroids. Troy says that he would have told her about his crimes when they got to know each other better, and he storms off, leaving Veronica to look after in despair. Veronica confronts Hank Zigman and hands him the $8,000, but he still says they are not \\"even.\\" Veronica claims that he will eventually regret that moment. She then uses an image of Zigman she took with her phone for an unknown purpose. Troy's father sends Troy off in a cab angrily. Troy's taxi stops at the restaurant in Tijuana where they originally \\"lost\\" the car. Troy is then seen pulling out in the stolen car. He talks with a girl named Shauna (with whom he had previously conspired), and she tells him that Veronica called and she accidentally revealed their whole plan to Veronica. It turns out that Veronica replaced the steroids with candy and left a sarcastically angry letter for Troy. Zigman is arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border using the photo Veronica took. That night, Veronica receives a call from her mother, who says that she misses her but that Veronica cannot (and will not) find her.  Arc significance  *Troy is revealed as a drug dealer and leaves town to meet his girlfriend, who is also in on the drug scheme. However, Veronica figures everything out before he realizes it and flushes his stash down a toilet. *Veronica finds a safe deposit box key which leads to some of her mother's belongings. When she opens the safe deposit box, she finds pictures of herself in gun sights. *Veronica's mother calls her at the end of the episode and lets her know that she is okay and that 'everything will make sense when the time is right'. The call goes directly to Veronica's voicemail.  Music  In addition to the series' theme song, \\"We Used to Be Friends\\", by The Dandy Warhols, the following music is heard in the episode: *\\"Such Great Heights\\" by The Postal Service *\\"Put Your Lights On\\" by Santana featuring Everlast *\\"The New Kid\\" by Old 97's  Production  Series regular Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn) is absent from the episode. In addition, \\"You Think You Know Somebody\\" features recurring character Troy Vandegraff's departure from the show (except for a brief guest appearance in a second season episode). This episode's title refers to Veronica's betrayal by two characters—Troy and her mother.  Reception  Critical reviews centered on the plot twist involving Troy Vandegraff (Aaron Ashmore, pictured) = Ratings = In its original broadcast, \\"You Think You Know Somebody\\" was watched by 2.73 million viewers, a significant drop from the previous episode. The airing ranked 107 of 114 in the weekly rankings. = Reviews = The episode garnered critical praise, with many centering on the eventual characterization and fate of the character of Troy Vandegraff. Price Peterson of TV.com, in a positive review, praised the plot twist at the end of the episode. \\"The fact that [Troy] was a bad guy all along just proved to me that this show might just have some tricks up its sleeves.\\" Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club also lauded the plot twist. While calling the episode \\"[the show's] next step forward,\\" the reviewer also wrote that \\"the writers pulled the rug out from that perception in an impressive, not frustrating fashion.\\" Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic also remarked on Troy's negative side, but also commented positively on Keith's characterization. \\"We finally get to see a little bit more of Keith's emotional state this week, with the episode proving he was every bit as hurt as Veronica by his wife's sudden disappearance.\\"  References   External links  *\\"You Think You Know Somebody\\" at Mars Investigations Category:2004 American television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 1) episodes ","title":"You Think You Know Somebody"},{"id":"3916598","text":"The response to the 2006 State of the Union Address was delivered by Virginia Governor Tim Kaine on January 31, 2006, after United States President George W. Bush delivered his 2006 State of the Union address. The theme of Kaine's speech, \\"A Better Way\\", advocates the Democratic Party's policies and states' rights. Kaine delivered the speech from Virginia's historic Executive Mansion in Richmond and the speech was televised nationwide. Introduction Kaine begins his speech by recalling his work as a Catholic missionary in Honduras where he learned the value of measuring one's \\"life by the difference [one] can make in someone else's life.\\" Kaine mourns the loss of Coretta Scott King, as Bush did in the introduction of his speech, who \\"embodied that value.\\" Kaine's diction emphasizes the role of elected officials as public servants, portraying the duties of office as a \\"higher calling\\" and referring to the federal government's duty to \\"serve the American people\\" as a frustrated \\"mission\\" due to the Bush administration's \\"poor choices and bad management.\\" Criticism of government policies Kaine attacks the government's most controversial actions and positions; the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina (See also: Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina), \\"Families in the Gulf Coast see [the government's mistakes] as they wait to rebuild their lives\\", the United States economy, \\"Americans who lose their jobs see [the government's mistakes] as they look to rebuild their careers\\", the Iraq War, \\"and our soldiers in Iraq see that as they try to rebuild a nation\\". =Bipartisan cooperation= Both Bush and Kaine emphasize the need for bipartisan cooperation. Kaine, \\"As Americans, we do great things when we work together. Some of our leaders in Washington seem to have forgotten that.\\" Bush, \\"... even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone... our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger... we must act in a spirit of good will and respect for one another.\\" Kaine's theme: \\"A better way\\" Kaine offers \\"good news\\", stating that \\"Virginia and other states\\" were succeeding \\"by focusing on service, competent management and results\\", the theme of his speech. He also points out that, under previous Governor Mark Warner, Virginia was voted \\"Best Managed State\\", in order to draw a stark contrast with the financial state of the nation, saying a citizen has \\"a right to expect that your government can deliver results\\". He then poses a series of hypothetical situations, linked through the anaphoric repition of the word \\"When\\", invoking the September 11, 2001 attacks, Hurricane Katrina and attacking the quality of Education in the United States. He particularly criticizes the government's fiscal policy, insisting that citizens \\"have a right to expect [the] government to be fiscally responsible, pay the bills and live within its means\\", a criticism of governmental corruption and the trillion dollar \\"staggering national debt\\". Kaine accuses Bush mismanagement, citing his tax cuts, and paralleling the \\"huge surpluses\\" of the Clinton administration with the \\"massive deficits\\" of the Bush administration. Kaine asks rhetorically, \\"Why should we allow this administration to pass down the bill for its reckless spending to our children and grandchildren?\\" and repeats his theme, \\"There's a better way.\\" Success in Virginia Kaine switches his focus from an international level to a state level, discussing the fiscally successful budget reached \\"Two years ago in Virginia\\" by Republican legislators and former Democratic Virginia governor Mark Warner. Kaine's first points attack inadequate \\"service... management and results.\\" The second part of the speech is outlined by Kaine's success on a state level and Bush's mistakes on a national level, \\"By focusing on results we were able to... protect the essential services that families rely on: education, health care, law enforcement.\\" =Education= Kaine denounces the No Child Left Behind Act for \\"wreaking havoc on local school districts\\" and blames Bush for allegedly underfunding the act while \\"refusing to let states try innovative alternatives\\" and \\"cutting billions of dollars from the student loan programs.\\" He repeats his theme a third time and recalls how \\"governors from across the country worked together in a bipartisan fashion to reform the senior year of high school\\", a sentence that repeats the bipartisanship, working, and reform emphasized in his comment on the Virginia budget, \\"Democrats and Republicans worked together to reform our budget\\". He notes how states \\"are working to make... pre-kindergarten accessible to every family.\\" Announcing a Democrat plan \\"to educate 100,000 new engineers, scientists and mathematicians in the next four years\\", Kaine proposes an alternative policy to the Bush administration. However, his statement remains vague as he never actually states the Democrat's plan. Instead, he points to \\"record investments in education... [resulting in] more accredited schools [and] better student test scores\\", and attributes this to Virginian bipartisan cooperation. Political significance The success of Democrats in Virginia, notably Kaine's election as Governor, provided a success story for national Democrats to begin 2006, which was to be a year of a Congressional midterm election. The success of Kaine and Warner in rebuilding the Democratic Party in the Republican-leaning state was rewarded with Kaine's response to President Bush, which highlighted the competence of Virginia's Democratic administration with the perceived incompetence of the Bush Administration in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The political success and strength of Virginia Democrats would be heightened the following January, when newly elected Virginia Senator Jim Webb would be chosen to deliver the Democratic response to the 2007 State of the Union address. In continuing the tradition of a Democrat from a red state delivering the Democratic response, Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius gave the response to the 2008 State of the Union address. Webb's election over incumbent Senator George Allen in the 2006 Virginia Senate election tipped control of the United States Senate to the Democratic Party for the first time in four years and, with the election of a Democratic majority in the US House of Representatives, resulted in the first Democratic-controlled Congress in twelve years.

He first appeared in DC Comics' Green Lantern Corps: Recharge # 1 (November 2005), and was created by writers Geoff Johns and Dave Gibbons, and artist Patrick Gleason. He was named after editor Peter Tomasi, in that Isamot is Tomasi spelled backwards. Fictional character history Kol is a Lizarkon (a humanoid lizard belonging to one of the many different species who inhabit Thanagar) and a veteran soldier of the Rann-Thanagar War. A member of the Imperial Thanagarian Army, Kol was scheduled to be executed for killing his commanding officer because his superior wanted to surrender to a squadron of Rannians. Kol explains to a fellow prisoner that he hates cowards, and that after killing his superior, he and the rest of his squad defeated the Rannians, and that his fellow soldiers attempted to report the superior’s death as an accident, but Kol, who personally held truth as a guiding principle, refused to lie.Green Lantern Corps: Recharge #1 (November 2005) At the exact moment before he was to be executed however, he is saved by a Green Lantern power ring, the powerful weapon assigned to each member of the Green Lantern Corps. The Corps was in the process of recruiting 7,200 new members in an effort to rebuild their ranks following their destruction at the hands of the villain Parallax. The rings allow their bearers to conjure virtually any object or form of energy limited only by the imagination and willpower of the wearer, and thus the ring, which includes a sentient computer, frees Kol from his bonds, and allows him to escape his captors. His fellow prisoner begs to be taken also but Kol refuses, believing the man to have actually earned his fate. Kol is brought to the planet Oa, home to the extraterrestrial Guardians of the Universe who administer and oversee the Corps, for Green Lantern training. =Spider Guild= Kol is given a temporary badge and partnered with fellow new recruit Vath Sarn, a Rannian who was also plucked from the war. In contrast to Sarn’s discipline and adaptability, Kol still saw Sarn as an enemy from the war, and instigated conflict with him as they began their first assignment. This was diverting ships away from Star 38, which, like several recent stars, had begun to show signs of instability. Kol was also slow to adapt to Corps protocols, questioning his orders, and even threatening an Okaaran hospital ship that fired upon him after refusing to change course from the star. The star eventually went supernova, and the two new recruits valiantly attempted to pull the ship from the ensuing black hole, but were sucked in. This was part of a planned attack by the Spider Guild, operating from the forbidden Vegan system. They are discovered by the GL trainer Kilowog, who had broken Lantern rules to find them. Isamot and Sarn, forced to go on by themselves due to Kilowog not being able to fit in the tunnels they were using, find out the Guild's plans to invade Oa. The Guild detect them and attack. The three join up with Guy Gardner and Kyle Rayner, who had also broken the rules to rescue the missing and unwilling GL recruit Soranik Natu. Soranik's unwillingness to be a Lantern causes Kol to perceive her as a traitor. Despite this and other conflicts, the six Lanterns successfully make it back to Oa.Green Lantern Corps: Recharge #4 (February 2006) They help in driving off the invasion of Guild forces. =Thanagar problems= Isamot decides to reduce his serving time from the Green Lantern Corps, due to the mating urges (akin to a Pon farr) as a member of his species. He announced his desire to serve back again on Thanagar for a while, living with his intended mate Qaylyra, another saurian. On his unfortune, Citadel forces, alleged allies of Rann, attack Thanagar just as Isamot's mate enters her only receptive mating period.Green Lantern Corps (vol.2) #4 (November 2006) Isamot then must choose between his partner and the only possibility of a family. He chose his partner but by the time he returned she had taken another mate. With the mating urges over he returns to full duty. He later visits Mogo on Vath's advice for Mogo to council him on the pain for his recent loss, but rejects the therapy after noticing something is amiss when Green Man is behaving strangely.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #10 When he, Vath, and Bzzd were sent after Guy Gardner, who was accused of murdering two fellow Green Lanterns, and confronted him on Mogo, Isamot was the first to believe Guy's story of something bizarre happening on Mogo due to his earlier suspicions. After arriving later, Soranik Natu, a medical expert, confirms that Mogo is infected with a disease created by the mushroom spores laid across its surface, and Isamot assists his fellow Lanterns in curing Mogo, while fighting off Kilowog, due to Kilowog also having been infected.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #13 Isamot fights alongside Vath during the Sinestro Corps War. Later, he is forcibly pulled to Oa to take part in a treaty- breaking incursion into the depths of Okarran space, along with other Green Lanterns. The very act of being taken to Oa causes him to disrupt Thanagar flying police officers, who scoff and insult the very concept of a 'downsider' Green Lantern. Isamot is part of a Green Lantern force sent to the time- ravaged Earth. The Lanterns join with dozens of other powered beings to put an end to Darkseid's plans for the planet.Final Crisis #5 (December 2008) =Blackest Night= A swarm of black power rings descend on Oa, turning all the honored dead in the Lantern crypt into Black Lanterns, who promptly attack the living Lanterns.Blackest Night #1 (September 2009) As Isamot and Varth find themselves overwhelmed by the onslaught of the dead, they are saved by a member of the Indigo Tribe.Green Lantern Corps (vol.2) #41 (December 2009) When Varth loses his legs to the Black Lanterns, Kol has his own legs amputated so that they can be transplanted onto Varth, Kol's reptilian physiology allowing him to regrow his limbs and wanting to give his friend and partner a chance to continue his service in the Corps. =The New 52= In this modified version of reality, Isamot is part of an army of Green Lanterns sent to fight an army of genocidal warriors. Their first Lantern victims include Siram and Bboc. This hits Isamot especially hard, as the two were part of his recruit class. In fighting the warriors, Isamot is sucked through a dimensional breach to their homeworld. He loses all of his limbs but this is something he can recover from in time.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 3) #2 (December 2011) He survives this and becomes a prisoner of war with several Lanterns until another force led by Guy Gardner rescues everyone. Isamot rejoins a squad backed up by a veteran team of Lanterns called the 'Mean Machine'. They learn the army were former caretakers of the Lantern Corps actual lanterns, until the removal of them devastated the army's home world. Isamot and his allies, using the murder of two Sciencell prisoners, breaks the morale of the genocidal army and ultimately defeats them.Green Lantern Corps #3-6 (January–April 2012) Later after Salaak and Kilowog discovered the Guardian's plans for the Third Army, Isamot was among the trusted members that Kilowog contacted and recruited to oppose the Guardians and later fought alongside his comrades against the Third Army. The Third Army was the Guardian's plans to turn every person in the galaxy into obedient slaves. This is neutralized when Sinestro kills most of the original Guardians.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 3) Annual #1) Later, Isamot is seen fighting alongside fellow Lanterns to protect the Indigo Tribe from the forces of the New Gods.\\"Sinestro\\" #6 (October 2014) He later becomes a prisoner of those entities along with many of his Corps.\\"New Guardians\\" #37 (Feb. 2015) As with most Green Lanterns, Isamot Kol became lost in the universe proceeding this one. He is seen safely with a small squadron of other Lanterns, having seen the beacon Mogo sent out.Green Lantern Corps: Edge of Oblivion #1 (Jan. 2016) Ismaot is later seen with the reformed, struggling Corps, rescuing Xudarians from Starro. Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #13 (March 2017) After answering what seems to be a pointless emergency call, Isamot and Sarn find a heretofore unknown Guardian allied with the current Green Lanterns of Earth. They are later tasked by current Corps Leader John Stewart to return and fetch the Guardian and the Earth Lanterns back to Mogo.

Shih is best known for playing antagonists and villains in several early Hong Kong wuxia and martial arts films that dated back to the black-and-white period, and is most familiar to Western audiences for his portrayal of the primary villain, Han, in the 1973 martial arts film Enter the Dragon, which starred Bruce Lee. Biography =Early life= Shih was raised by his stepmother and was a sickly child. He decided to practise martial arts to improve his health and trained for nine years. Shih trained at Shanghai's Chin Woo Athletic Association and was among the first generation of students at the school to be certified as instructors. After becoming certified to teach styles, including Eagle Claw and Choy Li Fut, he decided to start his career as an actor. However, the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War caused his studies to be disrupted. Shih and his friends travelled between Guangzhou and Hong Kong to stage drama performances, in order to raise funds as part of the anti-Japanese movement. Besides acting on stage, Shih also participated in back-stage activities, such as makeup and arrangements of lighting and props. =Career= In 1940, Shih officially entered the entertainment industry as an apprentice of the Cantonese opera makeup artist Sit Kok-Sin, before becoming an actor later. Shih starred as a Japanese secret agent in his debut film Flower in the Sea of Blood that year. Nine years later, Shih was invited by film director Wu Pang to work with him on a series of Wong Fei-hung-related films. Shih gained fame for his portrayal of the villains in those films and continued to play the role of the antagonist in several films during the first 20 years of his career. Shih's iconic \\"villain laughter\\" in the films was later mimicked and parodied by several actors. In 1973, Shih was chosen to portray the villain in Bruce Lee's martial arts movie Enter the Dragon, in which he played Han, a one-handed triad boss who is highly skilled in martial arts. His character had a final showdown with Lee's character in the ending climax of the film. In 1975, Shih joined the Hong Kong television station TVB and appeared in several wuxia- themed television series, playing villains again most of the time. However, he had also played the roles of gentlemanly, kind and fatherly characters, such as Cheung Mo-kei's godfather Tse Shun in The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber (1978), Lung Koon-sam in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1979), So Tai-pang in The Brothers (1980) and a grandfather in The Feud of Two Brothers (1986). Shih had also taken on dramatic roles in non-wuxia films as well, such as Hong Kong 1941. Later in his career, Shih took on a comedic role with Jackie Chan in The Young Master. In 1980, Shih was invited to participate in filming a television commercial to promote Ricola's mint candy products with his popular image of a film villain. =Retirement and death= Shih retired from the entertainment industry in 1992, with the 1994 film HK Adam's Family (奸人世家) specially dedicated to him. He appeared in the 2003 documentary Chop Socky: Cinema Hong Kong at the age of 90. Shih received the Life Achievement Award in 1996 at the Golden Bauhinia Awards. Seven years later in 2003, Shih received the Professional Achievement Award at the 22nd Hong Kong Film Awards with Cho Tat- wah, who portrayed the protagonist or hero in several of the films they starred together in. In 2006, Shih donated one of his properties to the entertainment industry in support of the development of the industry. Between January and February 2007, the Hong Kong Film Archive showed 13 of Shih's films that were preserved at the archive. Shih died of kidney failure on 3 June 2009 at the age of 96. At the time of his death, Shih was believed to be one of the oldest living successful actors in China. Personal life Shih married Lee Kit-ying in 1936 and they had four sons and two daughters. Shih was initially a non-believer but he converted to Christianity and was baptised after being influenced by Lee, a devout Christian. Lee Kit-ying died of heart failure in August 1998. Popular culture In Hong Kong, the term \\"Kan Yan Kin\\" () was a popular reference to Shih. This nickname was borrowed as the Chinese title for the 2007 TVB comedy drama Men Don't Cry.

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court struck down a provision requiring a political party to nominate 50 candidates before receiving certain benefits. Background Miguel Figueroa, the leader of the Communist Party of Canada, challenged the constitutionality of section 24 and 28 of the Canada Elections Act providing for a 50 candidate threshold as a violation of Section Three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The court challenge originated after the 1993 general federal election, when the CPC failed to field at least 50 candidates. Under the then Canada Elections Act, which had been amended just prior to the 1993 vote by the former Conservative government of Brian Mulroney, a registered federal party which fails to run at least 50 candidates in a general election would not only be automatically de-registered, but would also be stripped of its net assets which would then be turned over to the Government of Canada. Miguel Figueroa, acting on behalf of the Communist Party's membership, challenged these provisions in the Act, arguing that the 50-candidate rule, combined with the increase in candidate deposits - which for smaller parties would be only partially refundable - and the seizure of party assets, together constituted draconian and unfair discrimination against smaller political parties. In 1999, Justice Anne Molloy of the Superior Court of Ontario (General Division) struck down many of the Act's provisions as unconstitutional, including the seizure of party assets and the non-refundability of candidate deposits for those failing to garner at least 15% of the vote in an election. Justice Molloy also struck down the 50-candidate threshold requirement for federal parties to maintain their registration. The Attorney-General, on behalf of the Government of Canada, did not appeal the Molloy rulings on the seizure of assets and the non-refundability of candidate's deposits; these sections of the Canada Elections Act were subsequently changed by the Parliament of Canada. However, the A-G did appeal Molloy's decision striking down the 50-candidate threshold rule. The case then proceeded to the Ontario Court of Appeal. In 2001, the Court of Appeal rendered a split decision, holding that while in its opinion the 50-candidate rule itself was constitutional, it was unconstitutional to fail to provide the party identifier on the ballot, as this denied important information about candidates to electors when completing their ballot. The Court instructed Parliament to establish a lower threshold in such cases. Following this ruling, Parliament again amended the Act to set a 12-candidate threshold for the party identifier, meaning that parties fielding at least 12 candidates in a general election would have the party name included on the ballot next to their candidates' names. Figueroa, represented by Peter Rosenthal, then sought to appeal this judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the ruling of the Ontario Court of Appeal was flawed in interpreting the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and that the 50-candidate rule did in fact constitute discrimination against smaller parties under the Charter. The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) granted leave to appeal, and the case was argued before the SCC in 2002. Opinion of the court Justice Iacobucci, writing for the majority, stated that section 3 protects not just the right to vote but also provides the right of every citizen to participate in politics. The right ensures that each citizen can express an opinion about the formation of the country's public policy and the country's institutions. However, Iacobucci noted that section 3 does not protect unlimited participation. Rather it protects: :the right of each citizen to play a meaningful role in the process; the mere fact that the legislation departs from absolute voter equality or restricts the capacity of a citizen to participate in the electoral process is an insufficient basis on which to conclude that it interferes with the right of each citizen to play a meaningful role in the electoral process For a violation to be found there must be a prohibition against \\"meaningful\\" participation.

Born in Centerville, South Dakota, his father was a Congregational minister who immigrated from Armenia. The family changed their name to West when Levon and his brothers did not want to enlist in the service during World War I under their Armenian last name, Assadoorian. The name West was chosen as it was the maiden name of Levon's mother. Levon West adopted the pen name of Ivan Dmitri to use for his color photography. His etchings and watercolors were always done under his original name, Levon West. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Early years Levon West moved often as a boy, as his father preached in a series of North Dakota towns. His father was pastor at the Congregational Church in Glen Ullin from 1914 to 1918, when the family moved to Harvey. West graduated from high school in Harvey as valedictorian, and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1924. He wanted to take almost entirely art courses but his father insisted that he major in business administration. West served in the United States Navy during World War I. Professional career While in New York studying at the Art Students’ League, he formed an aviation corporation with friends. They serviced planes at Roosevelt Field on Long Island. One day he noticed a different type of plane and did sketches of it. This plane belonged to Charles Lindberg. When West heard Lindberg flew the Spirit of St. Louis on a record breaking trans- Atlantic flight, he hurriedly did an etching from his sketches and took it to the New York Times. The paper asked how much he wanted for it and he said, “I don’t care how much I get for it, but put my name on it good and big at the bottom.” When the newspaper came out with his etching on the front page demand for his work followed. He was contacted by the Kennedy Galleries in New York the following day. This led to a series of successful etchings and national prominence. He was also a skilled watercolorist. When he began working with color photography, Levon West adopted the pen name \\"Ivan Dmitri,\\" though he continued to use the name Levon West for his non-photographic works. 'Ivan Dmitri' was a pioneer in color photography, and wrote several books on the subject, his first being, \\"Color in Photography\\" in 1939. The first color photographic cover on the Saturday Evening Post magazine (May 29, 1937)was by Dmitri, a photo of an Automobile racing driver seated in his race car. Another SEP cover, May 16, 1944, was a photo of General 'Hap' Arnold, with B-17's flying overhead, with a B-17 crew planning a flight. This cover was so popular that the United States used the photo image to print a very rare World War II (war effort) poster. As Ivan Dmitri, he helped to gain acceptance for photography as an art medium, and established one of the first photography exhibits at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Dmitri felt that such a move was necessary in order for the public to treat photography as art, rather than just something reserved smaller mediums like books, magazines, and newspapers. In 1959, Ivan Dmitri founded Photography in the Fine Arts. West was a recipient of the North Dakota Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award in April 1962, the third person so inducted.

The Transportation Worker Identification Credential (or TWIC) program is a Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Coast Guard initiative in the United States. The TWIC program provides a tamper-resistant biometric credential to maritime workers requiring unescorted access to secure areas of port facilities, outer continental shelf facilities, and vessels regulated under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, or MTSA, and all U.S. Coast Guard credentialed merchant mariners. As of May 2014, there were 2,999,058 people enrolled in the program. Those seeking unescorted access to secure areas aboard affected vessels, and all Coast Guard credentialed merchant mariners, must obtain a TWIC. The new measures were fully implemented on April 15, 2009.https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1209745179774.shtm To obtain a TWIC, an individual must provide biographic and biometric information such as fingerprints, sit for a digital photograph and successfully pass a security threat assessment conducted by TSA. The issued card (pictured right) contains a computer chip, known as an Integrated Circuit Chip (ICC), which stores the holder's information and biometric data. The chip can be read by inserting it into a reader or holding it near a \\"contactless\\" reader. There is also a magnetic strip (similar to a credit card) and a linear barcode on the back as alternative reading methods.Frequently Asked Questions: Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC®) from the Transportation Security Administration. Retrieved December 22, 2011. Maritime sector While TWIC may be implemented across other transportation modes in the future, the TWIC Final Rule, published in the Federal Register on January 25, 2007, sets forth regulatory requirements to implement this program in the maritime mode first. The program's goals are: *Positively identify authorized individuals who require unescorted access to secure areas of the nation's maritime transportation system; *Determine the eligibility of an individual to be authorized unescorted access to secure areas of the maritime transportation system; *Enhance security by ensuring that unauthorized individuals are denied unescorted access to secure areas of the nation's maritime transportation system; and, *Identify individuals who fail to maintain their eligibility qualifications after being permitted unescorted access to secure areas of the nation's maritime transportation system and revoke the individual's permissions. Workers required to obtain a TWIC include credentialed merchant mariners, port facility employees, longshoremen, truck drivers, and others requiring unescorted access to secure areas of security-regulated maritime facilities and vessels. Other transportation sectors In addition to the maritime sector, the TWIC may be required in the future for other security- sensitive transportation sectors, such as airports, railroads, chemical plants, and refineries. One chemical manufacturing industry representative says it's only a matter of time before the entire manufacturing industry requires workers to have TWIC cards. Security threat assessment Each TWIC applicant undergoes a security threat assessment. The assessment considers convictions, arrest warrants, and indictments for certain offenses and other background information. In the case of arrests that do not indicate the disposition, the applicant will be notified by TSA, and the applicant must provide TSA with written proof that the arrest did not result in conviction for the offense. =Permanent disqualifying criminal offenses= An applicant is permanently disqualified if convicted of the following felonies: Espionage, sedition, treason, terrorism,As defined in a crime involving a transportation security incident,A transportation security incident is a security incident resulting in a significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption in a particular area, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 70101. The term \\"economic disruption\\" does not include a work stoppage or other employee-related action not related to terrorism and resulting from an employer-employee dispute. improper transportation of hazardous material, unlawful acts involving explosives, murder, bomb threats, serious racketeering offenses, or attempts/conspiracy to commit these acts. =Interim disqualifiying criminal offenses= An applicant is disqualified for a period of time for other convictions, if the applicant was convicted in the past seven years and/or released from incarceration resulting from conviction within the past five years, for: Unlawful acts involving firearms, extortion, fraud (does not include welfare fraud and passing bad checks), bribery, smuggling, immigration violations, drug distribution/importation, arson, kidnapping, rape, assault with intent to kill, robbery, fraudulent entry into a seaport, and lesser racketeering offenses, or attempts/conspiracy to commit these acts. =Other parts of the security threat assessment= In addition to criminal offenses, TSA will determine immigration status and look for records indicating mental incapacity. TSA may conduct other analyses, including searching international databases, terrorist watchlists, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), other databases, and may search to see if other extensive foreign or domestic criminal convictions exist. Issues =Loopholes= Due to U.S.C.G. Policy, persons can still gain access to facilities and vessels without possessing a TWIC card, for up to 30 days, if their employer applies to the TSA (Online) for such a temporary exemption. The employee then carries a print out of their approval along with State issued ID such as a drivers license. There is no provision for validation of this printed document but the employee is required to have \\"Escorted Access\\" which allows entry but prohibits them from certain areas without another employee escorting them. =Rollout= The Government Accountability Office has said the TWIC program has suffered from lack of oversight and poor coordination. Delays regarding developing and implementing card reader technology have meant that for the initial period TWIC cards will not be used in card readers. Additionally, a number of organizations have complained at the financial impact the program will have on already highly regulated industries. As of Jan 2016 vessels and waterfront facilities are still not required to possess TWIC card readers due to delays in the rule making for the devices and therefore a person with an invalidated TWIC card may still be able to gain un-escorted access to facilities and vessels due to an inability to verify cards on site.https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/pia-19-uscg- twicreader-PIA-20130325_0.pdf =Delays to applicants= According to a report by the National Employment Law Project, some TWIC applicants have experienced significant delays. Specifically, many applicants that receive initial denials based on background check returns face waits of six to eight months to complete the process to obtain a TWIC. Over 10,000 applicants out of the 1.5 million port workers could not work for an average of 69 days because they had not obtained a TWIC by the implementation date.Press Release from the National Employment Law Project, dated July 8, 2009. Retrieved Feb 11, 2010. =Faulty TWIC Cards= In November, 2011, the TSA announced that approximately 26,000 TWIC cards issued before April 5, 2011 would not work when inserted into a TWIC card reader. Each card contains a Federal Agency Smart Credential Number (FASC-N), which uniquely identifies each card in Federal databases, encoded on its ICC. On the faulty cards, the FASC-N has not been fully encoded, causing the readers to view the card as an invalid card. The agency has posted a list online with the serial numbers of affected cards. They say that they will replace the faulty cards at no further cost to the affected individual.IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING IMPROPERLY ENCODED TWIC® CARDS from the Transportation Security Administration, dated November 2011. Retrieved December 22, 2011. =Criticism= Critics assert that the program has cost over $420 million and has little to show for it. A 2013 GAO report found the TWIC card reader pilot program results to be unreliable and questioned \\"the program's premise and effectiveness in enhancing security.\\" Rep. John Mica (R-FL) has called them \\"at best no more useful than library cards. =Legislation= On July 28, 2014, the United States House of Representatives passed the Essential Transportation Worker Identification Credential Assessment Act (H.R. 3202; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the United States Department of Homeland Security to assess the effectiveness of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential program. The bill would require an independent assessment of how well the TWIC program improves security and reduces risks at the facilities and vessels it is responsible for. The evaluation would include a cost-benefit analysis and information on alternate technologies that could be used.

One of Hancock's achievements as a member of the council was the preservation of the Berkeley marina from development. She helped conduct a study by a group of students from the University of California, Berkeley that showed that major development in the marina area would threaten the wildlife in the area. Hancock was the first woman to be elected the Mayor of Berkeley, California, succeeding Gus Newport in 1986. Serving as mayor for two terms, she balanced seven straight city budgets, forged a historic agreement between the city and the University of California, began the revitalization of downtown Berkeley, led efforts to secure additional open space and launched a Bio-Tech Academy at Berkeley High School (in partnership with Bayer), and managed to repair many potholes in Berkeley streets during a very short period prior to her second election as Mayor.  Roles in Presidential administrations Senator Hancock also served as President Jimmy Carter's Regional Director for ACTION, overseeing a host of domestic volunteer programs including VISTA, Foster Grandparents, Senior Companions and Retired Senior Volunteer Program. In 1994, Hancock left her position as mayor of Berkeley to serve in the administration of President Bill Clinton. Hancock headed the Western Regional Office of the U.S. Department of Education. Working with schools, communities, state and local governments, she helped launch many of Clinton's education initiatives.  California State Assembly Hancock chaired the Assembly Committee on Natural Resources. She led the committee to pass environmental legislation that protects open space, expands recycling programs and promotes healthy city-infill strategies in the state. Hancock also chaired the Assembly Select Committee on Bridging the Achievement Gap which, working to reduce high dropout rates, improve school- to-career programs, and provide oversight of the federal No Child Left Behind Act. In 2007, Governor Schwarzenegger signed legislation authored by Assemblywoman Hancock to greatly expand career technical education programs for high school students. While in the Assembly, Hancock sat on the Assembly Committee on Rules and chaired the Subcommittee on Sexual Harassment and Violence Prevention, and was a member of the Committee on Education, the Committee on Housing and Community Development, the Budget Committee and the Budget Subcommittee on Health and Human Services. She worked in her committee positions to help expand health care programs for children, increase funding for foster youth programs and prevent cuts in Medi-Cal stipends and proposed cuts to programs for seniors and people with disabilities. In 2005, Hancock authored AB 144, which provided financing for the construction of the new eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. While the western span had undergone extensive repair and retrofitting, the eastern span retained substantial damage from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and its continued use posed a serious safety hazard. After more than a decade of planning and construction, the Bridge's new eastern span opened for public use in 2013. A strong advocate of campaign finance reform, Hancock authored AB 583, the California Clean Money and Fair Elections Act, to provide full public financing for all statewide races in California. In June 2007, the bill passed the Assembly with 45 votes. Hancock was the first Assemblymember in California to launch and maintain a blog.  California State Senate  In the 2008 Democratic primary for the 9th Senate District, Hancock defeated former Assemblywoman Wilma Chan for the party nomination by a percentage of 56.5% to Chan's 43.5%. She was overwhelmingly elected to the State Senate with 77.3% of the vote in November. Hancock was sworn in as a State Senator on December 1, 2008. Hancock is the former Chair of the Senate Public Safety Committee, as well as Senate Budget Subcommittee #5 on Public Safety & Corrections. She previously served as Chair of the Senate Committee on Elections and Constitutional Amendments. She also served as a member of the Senate committees on Education, Governance and Finance, Environmental Quality, Human Services, and Agriculture. In 2008, Hancock introduced SCA 5, which proposed to change the existing 2/3 supermajority requirement to pass a state budget with a simple majority vote rule. That constitutional amendment eventually became Proposition 25, which was approved by the people of California in the 2010 general election. Hancock drew national attention in 2011 for her introduction of SB 234, which proposed the imposition of a state sales tax on out-of-state internet companies, like Amazon.com, who sell goods in California. Later that year, the Legislature and Governor Jerry Brown reached a compromise with several internet companies to incorporate many of the provisions of SB 234 in the state budget. After the 2012 fire at the Chevron Refinery in Richmond, Hancock authored several pieces of legislation aimed at increasing governmental oversight over oil refineries. SB 54 increased the qualification requirements for employees who work at oil refineries. SB 1300 requires oil refinery operators to provide state regulators with vital information whenever an oil refinery undergoes a \\"turnaround\\", a shutdown of refinery operations in order to perform repairs or maintenance. In 2013, Hancock authored and passed SB 260, which provides a parole hearing process for state prisoners who committed their crimes before age 18 and were prosecuted as an adult. In 2015, she authored SB 261, which extended the eligibility for a parole hearing to prisoners who committed their crimes before age 23. Hancock authored SB 254, The Used Mattress Recovery and Recycling Act, in 2013 with then-Senator Lou Correa. SB 254 created a statewide mattress recycling program, just the third in the country after Connecticut and Rhode Island. The program, known as \\"Bye Bye Mattress,\\" is administered by CalRecycle, and became operational in early 2016. After the announcement of the planned construction of a coal export terminal in West Oakland, Hancock introduced several bills in 2016 to attempt to curtail the transport of coal through California. Later that year, Governor Brown signed SB 1279, which prohibits the use of state funds for the construction of new coal transportation projects. In his bill signing message, the Governor remarked that \\"other localities should follow suit—and the state should, too—to reduce, and ultimately, eliminate the shipment of coal through all California ports.\\" Personal life Ilona Harrington, known as Loni for short, was born in Chicago, Illinois on April 10, 1940. She grew up in New York City, the daughter of two Unitarian ministers. Her father, Donald Harrington, was the state Chairman of the Liberal Party of New York and a 1966 candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York. She received her Bachelor of Arts from Ithaca College, and a Masters of Arts from the Wright Institute. Hancock moved to Berkeley in 1964. Her first husband was Joseph Hancock, a professor of plant pathology at UC Berkeley. She is married to former Mayor of Berkeley and former Assemblymember Tom Bates. She has two children, two stepchildren from Bates's previous marriage, and seven grandchildren.

Capillary pressure can serve as both an opposing or driving force for fluid transport and is a significant property for research and industrial purposes (namely microfluidic design and oil extraction from porous rock). It is also observed in natural phenomena. Definition Examples of different wetting conditions at their respective contact angles Capillary pressure is defined as: :p_c=p_{\\\\text{non-wetting phase}}-p_{\\\\text{wetting phase}} where: :p_{\\\\text{c}}is the capillary pressure :p_{\\\\text{non-wetting phase}} is the pressure of the non-wetting phase :p_{\\\\text{wetting phase}} is the pressure of the wetting phase The wetting phase is identified by its ability to preferentially diffuse across the capillary walls before the non-wetting phase. The \\"wettability\\" of a fluid depends on its surface tension, the forces that drive a fluid's tendency to take up the minimal amount of space possible, and it is determined by the contact angle of the fluid.Fanchi, John R.. (2006). Principles of Applied Reservoir Simulation (3rd Edition). Elsevier. A fluid's \\"wettability\\" can be controlled by varying capillary surface properties (e.g. roughness, hydrophilicity). However, in oil-water systems, water is typically the wetting phase, while for gas-oil systems, oil is typically the wetting phase. Regardless of the system, a pressure difference arises at the resulting curved interface between the two fluids. Equations Capillary pressure formulas are derived from the pressure relationship between two fluid phases in a capillary tube in equilibrium, which is that force up = force down. These forces are described as: :{\\\\text{force up = interfacial tension of the fluid(s) acting along the perimeter of the capillary tube}} :{\\\\text{force down = (density gradient difference) x (cross-sectional area) x (height of the capillary rise in the tube)}} These forces can be described by the interfacial tension and contact angle of the fluids, and the radius of the capillary tube. An interesting phenomena, capillary rise of water (as pictured to the right) provides a good example of how these properties come together to drive flow through a capillary tube and how these properties are measured in a system. There are two general equations that describe the force up and force down relationship of two fluids in equilibrium.Schematic of capillary rise of water to demonstrate measurements used in the Young-Laplace equation The Young–Laplace equation is the force up description of capillary pressure, and the most commonly used variation of the capillary pressure equation: :p_c=\\\\frac{2\\\\gamma \\\\cos \\\\theta}{r_c} where: :\\\\gamma is the interfacial tension :r is the effective radius of the interface :\\\\theta is the wetting angle of the liquid on the surface of the capillary The force down formula for capillary pressure is seen as: :p_c=\\\\frac{\\\\pi r^2 h (\\\\Gamma_w-\\\\Gamma_{nw})}{\\\\pi r^2}=h(\\\\Gamma_w-\\\\Gamma_{nw}) where: :h is the height of the capillary rise :\\\\Gamma_w is the density gradient of the wetting phase :\\\\Gamma_{nw} is the density gradient of the non-wetting phase Applications =Microfluidics= Microfluidics is the study and design of the control or transport of small volumes of fluid flow through porous material or narrow channels for a variety of applications (e.g. mixing, separations). Capillary pressure is one of many geometry-related characteristics that can be altered in a microfluidic device to optimize a certain process. For instance, as the capillary pressure increases, a wettable surface in a channel will pull the liquid through the conduit. This eliminates the need for a pump in the system, and can make the desired process completely autonomous. Capillary pressure can also be utilized to block fluid flow in a microfluidic device. A schematic of fluid flowing through a microfluidic device by capillary action (refer to image of capillary rise of water for left and right contact angles in microfluidic channels) The capillary pressure in a microchannel can be described as: :p_c=-\\\\gamma\\\\left(\\\\frac{cos\\\\theta_b+cos\\\\theta_t}{d}+\\\\frac{cos\\\\theta_l+cos\\\\theta_r}{w}\\\\right) where: :{\\\\gamma} is the surface tension of the liquid :{\\\\theta_b} is the contact angle at the bottom :{\\\\theta_t} is the contact angle at the top :{\\\\theta_l} is the contact angle at the left side of the channel :{\\\\theta_r} is the contact angles at the right side of the channel :{d} is the depth :{w} is the width Thus, the capillary pressure can be altered by changing the surface tension of the fluid, contact angles of the fluid, or the depth and width of the device channels. To change the surface tension, one can apply a surfactant to the capillary walls. The contact angles vary by sudden expansion or contraction within the device channels. A positive capillary pressure represents a valve on the fluid flow while a negative pressure represents the fluid being pulled into the microchannel.Junker, D. (2002). Capillary Microfluidic Systems for Bio/Chemistry.  Measurement Methods  Methods for taking physical measurements of capillary pressure in a microchannel have not been thoroughly studied, despite the need for accurate pressure measurements in microfluidics. The primary issue with measuring the pressure in microfluidic devices is that the volume of fluid is too small to be used in standard pressure measurement tools. Some studies have presented the use of microballoons, which are size-changing pressure sensors. Servo-nulling, which is historically used for measuring blood pressure, has also been demonstrated to provide pressure information in microfluidic channels with the assistance of a LabVIEW control system. Essentially, a micropipette is immersed in the microchannel fluid and is programmed to respond to changes in the fluid meniscus. A displacement in the meniscus of the fluid in the micropipette induces a voltage drop, which triggers a pump to restore the original position of the meniscus. The pressure exerted by the pump is interpreted as the pressure within the microchannel.  Examples  Current research in microfluidics is focused on developing point-of-care diagnostics and cell sorting techniques (see lab-on-a-chip), and understanding cell behavior (e.g. cell growth, cell aging). In the field of diagnostics, the lateral flow test is a common microfluidic device platform that utilizes capillary forces to drive fluid transport through a porous membrane. The most famous lateral flow test is the take home pregnancy test, in which bodily fluid initially wets and then flows through the porous membrane, often cellulose or glass fiber, upon reaching a capture line to indicate a positive or negative signal. An advantage to this design, and several other microfluidic devices, is its simplicity (for example, its lack of human intervention during operation) and low cost. However, a disadvantage to these tests is that capillary action cannot be controlled after it has started, so the test time cannot be sped up or slowed down (which could pose an issue if certain time-dependent processes are to take place during the fluid flow). Another example of point-of-care work involving a capillary pressure-related design component is the separation of plasma from whole blood by filtration through porous membrane. Efficient and high-volume separation of plasma from whole blood is often necessary for infectious disease diagnostics, like the HIV viral load test. However, this task is often performed through centrifugation, which is limited to clinical laboratory settings. An example of this point-of-care filtration device is a packed-bed filter, which has demonstrated the ability to separate plasma and whole blood by utilizing asymmetric capillary forces within the membrane pores. =Petrochemical industry= Capillary pressure plays a vital role in extracting sub-surface hydrocarbons (such as petroleum or natural gas) from underneath porous reservoir rocks. Its measurements are utilized to predict reservoir fluid saturations and cap-rock seal capacity, and for assessing relative permeability (the ability of a fluid to be transported in the presence of a second immiscible fluid) data. Additionally, capillary pressure in porous rocks has been shown to affect phase behavior of the reservoir fluids, thus influencing extraction methods and recovery. It is crucial to understand these geological properties of the reservoir for its development, production, and management (e.g. how easy it is to extract the hydrocarbons). Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling unit on fire 2010 The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is an example of why capillary pressure is significant to the petrochemical industry. It is believed that upon the Deepwater Horizon oil rig’s explosion in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, methane gas had broken through a recently implemented seal, and expanded up and out of the rig. Although capillary pressure studies (or potentially a lack thereof) do not necessarily sit at the root of this particular oil spill, capillary pressure measurements yield crucial information for understanding reservoir properties that could have influenced the engineering decisions made in the Deepwater Horizon event. Capillary pressure, as seen in petroleum engineering, is often modeled in a laboratory where it is recorded as the pressure required to displace some wetting phase by a non-wetting phase to establish equilibrium.Tiab, Djebbar Donaldson, Erle C.. (2004). Petrophysics - Theory and Practice of Measuring Reservoir Rock and Fluid Transport Properties (2nd Edition). Elsevier. For reference, capillary pressures between air and brine (which is a significant system in the petrochemical industry) have been shown to range between 0.67 and 9.5 MPa.Melrose, J. C. (1990, February 1). Valid Capillary Pressure Data at Low Wetting-Phase Saturations (includes associated papers 21480 and 21618 ). Society of Petroleum Engineers. doi:10.2118/18331-PA There are various ways to predict, measure, or calculate capillary pressure relationships in the oil and gas industry. These include the following:  Leverett J-function  The Leverett J-function serves to provide a relationship between the capillary pressure and the pore structure (see Leverett J-function).  Mercury Injection  Flow diagram of the Mercury Injection Method for measuring capillary pressure: 1. Dried sample evacuated, 2. Mercury added, 3. System opened up to atmospheric pressure, mercury level drops, 4. Pressure increased drastically so that mercury enters the sample pores This method is well suited to irregular rock samples (e.g. those found in drill cuttings) and is typically used to understand the relationship between capillary pressure and the porous structure of the sample.Purcell, W.R. 1949. Capillary Pressures—Their Measurement Using Mercury and the Calculation of Permeability Therefrom. J Pet Technol 1 (2): 39-48. SPE-949039-G. In this method, the pores of the sample rock are evacuated, followed by mercury filling the pores with increasing pressure. Meanwhile, the volume of mercury at each given pressure is recorded and given as a pore size distribution, or converted to relevant oil/gas data. One pitfall to this method is that it does not account for fluid-surface interactions. However, the entire process of injecting mercury and collecting data occurs rapidly in comparison to other methods.  Porous Plate Method  The Porous Plate Method is an accurate way to understand capillary pressure relationships in fluid-air systems. In this process, a sample saturated with water is placed on a flat plate, also saturated with water, inside a gas chamber. Gas is injected at increasing pressures, thus displacing the water through the plate. The pressure of the gas represents the capillary pressure, and the amount of water ejected from the porous plate is correlated to the water saturation of the sample.  Centrifuge Method  The centrifuge method relies on the following relationship between capillary pressure and gravity: A simplified diagram of a centrifuge set-up for measuring capillary pressure of a brine-oil system :p_c=hg(\\\\rho_w-\\\\rho_{nw}) where: :h is the height of the capillary rise :g is gravity :\\\\rho_w is the density of the wetting phase :\\\\rho_{nw} is the density of the non-wetting phase The centrifugal force essentially serves as an applied capillary pressure for small test plugs, often composed of brine and oil. During the centrifugation process, a given amount of brine is expelled from the plug at certain centrifugal rates of rotation. A glass vial measures the amount of fluid as it is being expelled, and these readings result in a curve that relates rotation speeds with drainage amounts. The rotation speed is correlated to capillary pressure by the following equation: :p_c=7.9e^{-8}(\\\\rho_1-\\\\rho_2)\\\\omega^2(r_b^2-r_t^2) where: :r_b is the radius of rotation of the bottom of the core sample :r_t is the radius of rotation of the top of the core sample :\\\\omega is the rotational speed The primary benefits to this method are that it's rapid (producing curves in a matter of hours) and is not restricted to being performed at certain temperatures. Other methods include the Vapor Pressure Method, Gravity-Equilibrium Method, Dynamic Method, Semi-dynamic Method, and the Transient Method. Correlations In addition to measuring the capillary pressure in a laboratory setting to model that of an oil/natural gas reservoir, there exist several relationships to describe the capillary pressure given specific rock and extraction conditions. For example, R. H. Brooks and A. T. Corey developed a relationship for capillary pressure during the drainage of oil from an oil-saturated porous medium experiencing a gas invasion:Brooks, R.H. and Corey, A.T. 1964. Hydraulic properties of porous media. Hydrology Paper No. 3, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, 22–27. :p_{cgo}=p_t(\\\\frac{1-S_{or}}{S_o- S_{or}})^{(1/\\\\lambda)} where: :P_{cgo} is the capillary pressure between oil and gas phases :S_o is the oil saturation :S_{or} is the residual oil saturation that remains trapped in the pore at high capillary pressure :P_t is the threshold pressure (the pressure at which the gas phase is allowed to flow) :\\\\lambda is a parameter that is related to the distribution of pore sizes :\\\\lambda>2 for narrow distributions :\\\\lambda<2 for wide distributions Additionally, R. G. Bentsen and J. Anli developed a correlation for the capillary pressure during the drainage from a porous rock sample in which an oil phase displaces saturated water:Bentsen, R. G., & Anli, J. (1977, February 1). Using Parameter Estimation Techniques To Convert Centrifuge Data Into a Capillary-Pressure Curve. Society of Petroleum Engineers. doi:10.2118/5026-PA :p_{cow}=p_t-p_{cs}ln(\\\\frac{S_w-S_{wi}}{1-S_{wi}}) where: :P_{cow} is the capillary pressure between oil and water phases :P_{cs} is a parameter that controls the shape of the capillary pressure function :(\\\\frac{S_w- S_{wi}}{1-S_{wi}}) is the normalized wetting-phase saturation :S_w is the saturation of the wetting phase :S_{wi} is the irreducible wetting-phase saturation In nature =Needle ice= Image of needle ice In addition to being manipulated for medical and energy applications, capillary pressure is the cause behind various natural phenomena as well. For example, needle ice, seen in cold soil, occurs via capillary action. The first major contributions to the study of needle ice, or simply, frost heaving were made by Stephen Taber (1929) and Gunnar Beskow (1935), who independently aimed to understand soil freezing. Taber’s initial work was related to understanding how the size of pores within the ground influenced the amount of frost heave. He also discovered that frost heave is favorable for crystal growth and that a gradient of soil moisture tension drives water upward toward the freezing front near the top of the ground.Taber, S. (1930) The mechanics of frost heaving. Journal of Geology, Vol. 38, p. 303-317. In Historical Perspectives in Frost Heave Research, USA Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, Special Report 91-23, p. 29-35. In Beskow’s studies, he defined this soil moisture tension as “capillary pressure” (and soil water as “capillary water”). Beskow determined that the soil type and effective stress on the soil particles influenced frost heave, where effective stress is the sum of pressure from above ground and the capillary pressure.Beskow, G. (1935) Soil freezing and frost heaving with special applications to roads and railroads. Swedish Geological Society, C, no. 375, Year Book no. 3 (translated by J.O. Osterberg). In Historical Perspectives in Frost Heave Research, USA Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, Special Report 91-23, p. 41-157. In 1961, D.H. Everett elaborated on Taber and Beskow’s studies to understand why pore spaces filled with ice continue to experience ice growth. He utilized thermodynamic equilibrium principles, a piston cylinder model for ice growth and the following equation to understand the freezing of water in porous media (directly applicable to the formation of needle ice): Piston cylinder model for ice growth :P_s-P_l=\\\\Psi_{sl}\\\\frac{dA_r}{dV}=\\\\Psi_{sl}\\\\tilde{K} where: :{P_s} is the pressure of the solid crystal :{P_l} is the pressure in the surrounding liquid :{\\\\Psi_{sl}} is the interfacial tension between the solid and the liquid :{A_r} is the surface area of the phase boundary :{V} is the volume of the crystal :\\\\tilde{K} is the mean curvature of the solid/liquid interface With this equation and model, Everett noted the behavior of water and ice given different pressure conditions at the solid-liquid interface. Everett determined that if the pressure of the ice is equal to the pressure of the liquid underneath the surface, ice growth is unable to continue into the capillary. Thus, with additional heat loss, it is most favorable for water to travel up the capillary and freeze in the top cylinder (as needle ice continues to grow atop itself above the soil surface). As the pressure of the ice increases, a curved interface between the solid and liquid arises and the ice will either melt, or equilibrium will be reestablished so that further heat loss again leads to ice formation. Overall, Everett determined that frost heaving (analogous to the development of needle ice) occurs as a function of the pore size in the soil and the energy at the interface of ice and water. Unfortunately, the downside to Everett's model is that he did not consider soil particle effects on the surface. =Circulatory system= Capillaries in the circulatory system are vital to providing nutrients and excreting waste throughout the body. There exist pressure gradients (due to hydrostatic and oncotic pressures) in the capillaries that control blood flow at the capillary level, and ultimately influence the capillary exchange processes (e.g. fluid flux). Due to limitations in technology and bodily structure, most studies of capillary activity are done in the retina, lip and skin, historically through cannulation or a servo-nulling system. Capillaroscopy has been used to visualize capillaries in the skin in 2D, and has been reported to observe an average range of capillary pressure of 10.5 to 22.5 mmHg in humans, and an increase in pressure among people with type 1 diabetes and hypertension. Relative to other components of the circulatory system, capillary pressure is low, as to avoid rupturing, but sufficient for facilitating capillary functions.

Developed as a technology demonstrator, the F-15 STOL/MTD carried out research for studying the effects of thrust vectoring and enhanced maneuverability. The aircraft used for the project was pre-production TF-15A (F-15B) No. 1 (USAF S/N 71-0290), the first two-seat F-15 Eagle built by McDonnell Douglas (out of 2 prototypes), the sixth F-15 off the assembly line, and was the oldest F-15 flying up to its retirement. It was also used as the avionics testbed for the F-15E Strike Eagle program.Aircraft Description NASA 19 April 2010 The plane was on loan to NASA from the United States Air Force. This same aircraft would later be used in the F-15 ACTIVE (Advanced Control Technology for Integrated Vehicles) from 1993 to 1999, and later in the Intelligent Flight Control System programs from 1999 to 2008. While with NASA, the aircraft's tail number was 837; for the Quiet Spike program and Research Testbed it was 836, and 835 was used for the Highly Integrated Digital Electronic Control (HIDEC) program. The Aircraft now resides as a display on Edwards AFB Design and development Pre-production F-15B No. 2 (USAF S/N 71-0291) with 2D nozzle, c. early 1980s, a predecessor of STOL/MTD program A model of F-15 with 2-D nozzle in 1982 In 1975, Langley Research Center began to conduct sponsored programs studying two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzles; government and industry studies of non-axisymmetric two-dimensional (2-D) nozzles in the early 1970s had identified significant payoffs for thrust-vectoring 2-D nozzle concepts. In 1977, Langley started a system integration study of thrust-vectoring, thrust-reversing, and 2-D nozzles on the F-15 with McDonnell Douglas. In 1984, the Flight Dynamics Laboratory, the Air Force Aeronautical Systems Division awarded a contract to McDonnell Douglas for an advanced development STOL/MTD experimental aircraft. The aircraft used in the STOL/MTD program has flown several times since the successful STOL/MTD program completion in 1991 that used thrust vectoring and canard foreplanes to improve low-speed performance. This aircraft tested high- tech methods for operating from a short runway. This F-15 was part of an effort to improve ABO (Air Base Operability), the survival of warplanes and fighting capability at airfields under attack. The F-15 STOL/MTD tested ways to land and take off from wet, bomb-damaged runways. The aircraft used a combination of reversible engine thrust, jet nozzles that could be deflected by 20 degrees, and canard foreplanes. Pitch vectoring/reversing nozzles and canard foreplanes were fitted to the F-15 in 1988. NASA acquired the plane in 1993 and replaced the engines with Pratt & Whitney F100-229 engines with Pitch/Yaw vectoring nozzles.. The canard foreplanes were derived from the F/A-18's stabilators. Prior to August 15, 1991, when McDonnell Douglas ended its program after accomplishing their flight objectives, the F-15 STOL/MTD plane achieved some impressive performance results: * Demonstrated vectored takeoffs with rotation at speeds as low as * A 25-percent reduction in takeoff roll * Landing on just of runway compared to for the standard F-15 * Thrust reversal in flight to produce rapid deceleration =Further modifications= F-15 ACTIVE in 1996 During the 1990s the same F-15 airframe (USAF S/N 71-0290) was further modified (canards and nozzles were retained) for the ACTIVE (Advanced Control Technology for Integrated VEhicles) program in which Pitch/Yaw Balance Beam Nozzles (P/YBBN) and advanced control-logic programming were investigated. In the ACTIVE configuration it was also used for the LANCETS (lift and nozzle change effects on tail shock) program, in which computed supersonic shockwave parameters were compared to those measured in flight. The LANCETS flight tests ended in December 2008.. F-15 ACTIVE lasted from 1993–99. The aircraft would later be used in the F-15 IFCS (Intelligent Flight Control System) program from 1999 to 2008. The plane was also used for the Space-Based Range Demonstration and Certification project under the Exploration Communications and Navigation Systems program (SBRDC/ECANS) from 2006 to 2007, High Stability Engine Control (HISTEC) program and High-Speed Research Acoustics in 1997.

Marshall for determining the extent of constitutional protection upon Aboriginal practices. The Court held that there was no right to commercial logging granted in the \\"Peace and Friendship treaties of 1760\\", the same set of treaties where the right to commercial fishing was granted in the R. v. Marshall decision. This decision also applied and developed the test for aboriginal title from Delgamuukw v British Columbia. Background This decision considers two separate cases. In the first one, Stephen Marshall (no relation to Donald Marshall) and 34 other Mi'kmaqs were charged with cutting down timber on Nova Scotia Crown land without a permit. In the second case, Joshua Bernard, a Mi'kmaq was charged with possession of logs stolen from a rural New Brunswick saw mill that were cut from Crown lands. In both cases all of those accused argued that their status as Indian gave them the right to log on Crown land for commercial purposes as granted by the treaties of Peace and Friendship. At trial, the judges convicted all of those accused. At the provincial courts of appeal, the convictions were overturned. Opinion of the court McLachlin, writing for the majority, held that there was no right to commercial logging under the treaties. From the evidence she found that it did not support the conclusion that commercial logging formed the basis of the Mi'kmaq's traditional culture and identity. The majority restored the convictions at trial. Regarding the claim of aboriginal title, the majority affirms the test from Delgamuukw: \\"claimants must prove “exclusive” pre- sovereignty “occupation” of the land by their forebears.\\" Applying this test, the majority did not find that seasonal hunting or fishing in an area was sufficient, on its own, to establish the existence of aboriginal title. They left open the possibility that with enough evidence, nomadic or semi-nomadic people could establish aboriginal title based on their non-permanent use of a piece of land, as long as sufficient exclusivity or control was also demonstrated.

A ball-jointed doll is any doll that is articulated with ball and socket joints. In contemporary usage when referring to modern dolls, and particularly when using the acronyms BJD or ABJD, it usually refers to modern Asian ball-jointed dolls. Many BJDs are cast in polyurethane synthetic resin, a hard, dense plastic, and the parts strung together with a thick elastic. They are predominantly produced in Japan, South Korea and China. There are also some Asian companies that have turned to cheaper production methods by creating dolls using other plastics such as ABS. As ABS dolls in particular are manufactured using injection molding rather than being individually cast, they are generally less expensive. These dolls may be strung with elastic or assembled with hinges in their ball joints. Opinion in the BJD community is divided over what does and does not constitute a BJD, with some believing a BJD must be made of resin and strung, while others take the view that any doll with ball and socket joints can fit under the BJD label. There are currently no industry standards or manufacturing guidelines governing what is or is not, in fact, a BJD. There are also BJDs made by European artists, usually referred to as Artist BJDs. These dolls are normally made from polyurethane resin, though can also be made out of a wide variety of materials such as porcelain, paper clay and super sculpey. The BJD style has been described as both realistic and influenced by anime. They commonly range in size from about for the larger dolls, for the mini dolls, and all the way down to the very smallest BJDs. BJDs are primarily intended for adult collectors and customizers. They are made to be easy to customize, by painting, changing the eyes and wig, and so forth. The modern BJD market began with Volks line of Super Dollfie in 1999. Super Dollfie and Dollfie are registered trademarks but are sometimes erroneously used as generic blanket terms to refer to all Asian BJDs regardless of manufacturer. History Bisque-headed German doll with ball-jointed composition body, c.1920 Articulated dolls go back to at least 200 BCE, with articulated clay and wooden dolls of ancient Greece and Rome. The modern era ball-jointed doll history began in Western Europe in the late 19th century. From the late 19th century through the early 20th century French and German manufacturers made bisque dolls with strung bodies articulated with ball-joints made of composition: a mix of pulp, sawdust, glue and similar materials. These dolls could measure between and are now collectible antiques. During the 1930s the German artist Hans Bellmer created dolls with ball-joints and used them in photography and other surrealistic artwork. Bellmer introduced the idea of artful doll photography, which continues today with Japanese doll artists, as well as BJD hobbyists. Influenced by Bellmer and the rich Japanese doll tradition, Japanese artists began creating strung ball- jointed art dolls. These are commonly made entirely of bisque and often very tall, sometimes as tall as . These dolls are purely intended as art, and not for play or even the hobby level of collecting usually associated with dolls. They cost several thousand dollars, up to several hundred thousand dollars for older collectible dolls from famous artists. The art doll community is still active in Japan and artists regularly release artbooks with photographs of their dolls.Japattack - Figure+Doll=U-noa (Unoa Doll) Asian ball-jointed dolls are influenced by Japanese traditional dolls, like Ichimatsu dolls (pictured) The history of commercially produced Asian resin BJDs began in 1999 when the Japanese company Volks created the Super Dollfie line of dolls. The first Super Dollfie were 57 cm tall, strung with elastic, ball-jointed, and made of polyurethane resin; similar to garage kits, which were Volks main product at the time. Super Dollfie were made to be highly customizable and to find a female market for Volks products.1998  SD 10 Year History of Super Dollfie  Super Dollfie 10th Anniversary Special Web Site  VOLKS INC ( 2011-07-29)1999  SD 10 Year History of Super Dollfie  Super Dollfie 10th Anniversary Special Web Site  VOLKS INC ( 2011-07-29) See further: Super Dollfie History. The earliest Asian BJDs were influenced by the anime aesthetic. The early, prominent BJD companies Volks, Cerberus Project with the Delf line, as well as the Japanese artist Gentaro Araki with the U-noa line, all have backgrounds in anime-style resin figure kits. Around 2002–2003, South Korean companies started creating and producing BJDs. CustomhouseCustom House official site - company history \\"2002 December : Ball Jointed Doll company started.\\" (https://web.archive.org/web/20090614234648/http://www.customhouse.co.kr/en/about/index.asp) and Cerberus Project were among the first Korean BJDs companies, and since then the Korean market has expanded with many more. The earliest Chinese produced BJDs were knockoffs. Some were direct recasts, while others were slight modifications of Super Dollfie or Korean BJDs. These knockoffs were made of plaster, low quality resin or polystone — a mix of resin and a filler material like sand. They were low in price, but not very durable.Super Dollfie FAQ - Yumia (Forever) The first Chinese company to release their own original BJD sculpts in high quality polyurethane resin was Dollzone. Their dolls hit the market in 2006. Since then, several other Chinese companies followed suit, putting their own BJD creations on the international market. The first American company to produce a BJD with more of an American aesthetic influence was Goodreau Doll in 2007. Modern Asian BJDs Modern Asian BJDs are intended for adult collectors and customizers and range in price from US$100 to over US$1000. The more costly BJDs have body elements which are cast in polyurethane resin and held together by thick elastic cords, making them fully articulated and highly poseable. Dollfie Dreams, Smart Dolls and larger-sized Obitsu dolls are made of ABS with an outer skin made of PVC. These dolls possess an internal skeleton with hinges and ball joints. The least expensive dolls are injection-molded ABS and have pegs connecting their joints. BJDs tend to follow a distinctly Asian view in their aesthetics, but the designs are diverse and range from highly anime-inspired to hyper-realistic. LA Weekly said Asian BJDs are \\"often strangely human looking\\" while NPR described them as \\"eerily lifelike.\\"Pacific Media Expo Introduces Asian Ball-Jointed Doll Programming to the Convention - La Weekly, Nov 14, 2011Invasion Of The Ball- Jointed Dolls - NPR, September 09, 2008 Most are anatomically correct and have proportionally large heads, big eyes and comparatively large feet, contrasted with fashion dolls like Barbie, and are capable of standing on their own, without a stand or other support. =Customization= Female doll with face removed showing replaceable eyes. Note the velcro tab on the top of the head for wig attachment. BJDs are readily customizable. Wigs and eyes are easy to remove and replace, as well as heads, hands, and feet. A doll may even be a hybrid of parts from different companies. Some BJD owners or customizers even re-shape existing parts by sanding them or applying epoxy putty to them. The resin material is easier to paint than the softer and more slick vinyl often used for other types of dolls. BJD face paint is referred to as a face-up, to note that it's not just make-up, but all the facial features that are painted and customized, including eyebrows, lips and blushing to enhance features. Face-ups and body blushing are done with watercolor pencils, acrylic paint — applied with a regular brush or an airbrush — or soft pastels, and coated with a sprayed-on layer of clear matte sealant for protection. BJD face-ups, even from large companies, are always painted by hand, and it takes considerable skill to execute detailed, professional face-ups. =Culture= A BJD owner wearing Lolita fashion There is a sizeable international community dedicated to BJDs. The largest English language BJD internet community, Den of Angels, has over 43,000 members as of February 2016. Enthusiasts also have offline BJD meetups and in the US they organize conventions, like BJDC in Austin, Texas and GoGaDoll (previously Dollectable) in San Francisco. In Japan, Dolls Party conventions are organized by Volks, and some enthusiasts meet and take pictures of their dolls at doll-friendly maid cafés. In Hong Kong, a BJD convention called Dollvie is organized in 2015. Canadian and Northeastern US BJD collectors attend an annual convention called Doll North which is a part of Anime North in Toronto, Ontario. BJDs owners usually customize the look of their dolls, and they are often named, and sometimes assigned individual characteristics and personality traits. The dolls are often used as subjects of artistic work, such as photography or drawing, which is shared on the internet. Some use their dolls and characters for roleplaying. A small minority makes further emotional investment, going so far as to talk to their dolls as if they were alive. Some BJDs are collectible; limited editions and skillfully customized dolls can fetch prices much higher than the original in the second hand market, sometimes as much as US $5000. However, the customization and personalization aspects are usually more emphasized in the BJD world. Even collectible limited-edition BJDs are played with and used as props in photoshoots, and even dolls that are no longer in mint condition can command high prices in the second hand market. Many BJD owners have other interests such as anime, Gothic lolita and cosplay, and some dress their dolls in related styles. BJDs can often be seen dressed in contemporary and casual youth fashions like punk or goth. Other dolls may display fantasy elements like elf ears, vampire fangs, different types of wings, horns, hooves, and cyborg parts. Doll manufacturers sometimes base BJDs on characters from anime, manga, other works of fiction, or even historical figures. Some BJD owners similarly customize their dolls to create one-off representations of existing characters or celebrities. Asian BJDs have been featured in movies and other works. The Korean horror movie Doll Master from 2004Custom House official site - company history \\"2004 July : Movie [Doll Master] Main character Mina doll released\\" and the Taiwanese drama film Spider Lilies from 2007 feature BJDs. The virtual band Mistula is composed of customized BJDs, Super Dollfie and Delf dolls. The main characters in the manga and anime Rozen Maiden are ball- jointed living dolls. The horror novel, manga and anime Another also features BJDs. BJDs are also an important motif in the movie Ghost in the Shell: Innocence where many dolls have \\"spirits\\" of some sort, but at the same time are not quite human, with designs based on the art of Hans Bellmer.Monnet, Livia, 'Anatomy of Permutational Desire: Perversion in Hans Bellmer and Oshii Mamoru',Mechademia 5 (2010), 285-309 =Sizes and types= The earliest BJDs were all around tall, but as the market expanded they have been produced in many different types and sizes. There are roughly three main size categories for BJDs: full size, mini and tiny. Compare with Super Dollfie models. Large full size dolls, sometimes referred to as SD size from the Super Dollfie size range, are around . Roughly 1/3 scale, they usually represent fully grown teenagers or adult body types. There is also a range of even larger full size BJD, from about tall. Mini size dolls, sometimes referred to as MSD size from the Mini Super Dollfie size range, are about tall. There are two major categories of minis: those that are roughly in the same scale as the 1/3 full- size dolls and meant to look like children, and mature or slim minis which are meant to represent fully grown adults that are in 1/4 scale. Tiny BJDs are under tall. They are available in many different types and scales.Google Docs - Tiny BJD Sizes reference sheet Some tiny BJD are made to look like toddlers or babies next to full size dolls, these are about tall and are sometimes referred to as Yo-SD size after the Super Dollfie size range. Even smaller childlike dolls, tiny tinies, are usually not made to be in scale with any larger BJDs. A few tiny BJDs have mature bodies and are in the same 1/6 scale as fashion dolls like Barbie, about tall. Humanoid anthro animal BJDs are usually in the tiny size scale. =Production= Ball-jointed dolls are initially modeled in clay, commonly polymer clay. The hardened clay body parts are used to form molds for multiple parts to be cast in synthetic polyurethane resin. Cured resin has a hard, smooth, porcelain-like feel, but is less brittle. Unlike porcelain however, polyurethane tends to turn yellow and decay over time depending on exposure to UV light and heat. The resin casting process allows for molds to be produced with a relatively low initial investment, compared to the injection molding commonly used for mass produced vinyl dolls. However, the materials are more expensive, and the process requires more manual labor, resulting in a higher cost per unit. Most regular edition BJDs come assembled with an option for a \\"face-up,\\" the facial blushing and painting, while full set BJDs, which are often limited, include clothes, face-up, and sometimes full body blushing. A few BJDs are sold as bare unassembled parts in a kit, similar to a garage kit. =Lines and companies= BJDs are produced by anything from single-person outfits on a hobby level, to incorporated multinationals. Hobby artists in Asia, particularly Japan, and the West, particularly USA and Australia, create and sell their own dolls. In Asia there is a wide variety of companies making BJDs, most based in South Korea. The BJD Orbyrarium book lists 49 different BJD companies and one fan-run BJD database includes 125 companies as of February 2009. As of March 2018, there are over 600 different BJD companies and independent artists worldwide. A few of the most notable BJD lines and companies can be found below. On occasion, unauthorized copies or recasts of original dolls are sold, predominantly in South-East Asia. Several Korean and Japanese BJD companies have posted notices warning against recast dolls.Important Notice: Beware of imitation/VOLKS INC June 28, 2006Beware fake dolls!!

They are for example not allowed to be posted on the largest English BJD forum. Japan ;Super Dollfie from Volks Super Dollfie from Volks was the first line of modern Asian BJD. They set the range of sizes used by most companies. Volks have released a vast variety of different dolls, most of them limited editions, some in collaboration with fashion designers like Baby, The Stars Shine Bright and H. Naoto or anime series like Rozen Maiden. Volks has a number of stores in Japan and Korea, as well as one in Los Angeles. They also run the Super Dollfie museum, Tenshi-no-Sato in Kyoto, Japan. In 2004, Time magazine described Super Dollfie as having \\"trendily refined makeup\\" and \\"exaggerated features inspired by Japanese animation\\". Shojo Beat, in 2008, said they have \\"cool glassy expressions\\", \\"a distinct anime look\\" and that their styles \\"stay true to a Japanese aesthetic.\\" ;Smart Doll by Danny Choo Smart Doll is a range of 1/3 scale, ball-jointed, vinyl fashion dolls by Danny Choo. British-born Choo, the son of fashion designer Jimmy Choo, is a Malaysian blogger, television personality and the creator of Culture Japan, a Japanese television show that celebrates and explores Japanese culture. His first doll, Mirai Suenaga, became the mascot for Japanese Tourism in 2014. Smart Doll is available in four skin types: Cocoa, Tan, Cinnamon and Milk and feature interchangeable busts, hands, feet (for flat-soled and high-heeled shoes) eyes and wigs of various colors and lengths, all of which are manufactured exclusively in Japan. Smart Doll also has two dolls with port- wine stain facial birthmarks and one doll with Vitiligo. Smart Doll’s design and business philosophy centers around wabi-sabi, a set of Japanese design principles that celebrate imperfection and asymmetry. Their intricately designed and weathered clothing showcase this design characteristic. In 2019, Smart Doll released an additional body type made of a harder substance called Cortex, which is sturdier, resists staining from dark-colored apparel and is less-expensive than vinyl. While the original Smart Doll’s faces are created in the Japanese Anime/Manga aesthetic, the company is in the process of releasing additional dolls referred to as “Semi-Real” which resemble more lifelike characters from video and computer games. Additionally, Smart Doll has partnered with Warner Bros. Consumer Products to create a line of DC Comics heroes and heroines which will also be created in the Japanese Anime/Manga aesthetic. ;U-noa The Japanese artist Gentaro Araki first started in BJDs in 2000 with the 60 cm Andolrea U-Noss line in collaboration with Volks. He later went on to create his own company called Alchemic Labo with a line of mature minis called the U-noa Quluts, and later continued to branch out to other sizes including the 35 cm Unoa Quluts Chibi and the 64 cm Unoa Zero/Unon. Korea ;Delf from Luts and Cerberus Project The Delf dolls were one of the earliest lines from Korea, dating back to 2003. They are slightly taller and slimmer than Super Dollfie and there is a variety of doll types available, including dolls with elf ears and vampire teeth. Delf were originally designed by Japanese resin kit designers Cerberus Project and made and distributed by the Korean company Luts, who also own the rights to use the Delf name. These dolls are often referred to by the acronym CP, or as Luts dolls, after the distributor; dolls produced after 2007 are correctly known only as Luts dolls due to a split between Cerberus Project and Luts, who now trade separately. Minifee are mini-sized versions of the Delf dolls, distributed by Korean company Fairyland. ;Custom House Custom House is one of the oldest Korean BJD companies. Their dolls were featured in the Korean horror movie Doll Master from 2004. ;Doll in Mind D.I.M (Doll in Mind) produced, among other dolls, the Minimee, completely customized heads created from customer photos or drawings. Some people commissioned heads from them in the likeness of celebrities, anime/video game characters, TV show personas, or even comic book characters. ;Dollshe Dollshe introduced a line of tall, slim, double jointed mature boy dolls in 2003. These are slightly larger full size BJD, about 68 cm tall. Their Bermann doll was strictly limited and is one of the most sought after collectible BJDs. Tensiya has since split with Dollshe. ;Dream of Doll D.O.D. (Dream of Doll) was one of the earliest Korean companies to make a large line of child like minis, D.O.C. (Dream of Children). They have since expanded and now make, among others, the D.O.T. (Dream of Teen) line, the D.O.B line (Dream of Baby), and D.O.I. (Dream of Idol) line. ;Elfdoll Elfdoll is a subsidiary of the Korean company Artmaze. Elfdoll are created by the sculptor Rainman and a team of artisans. In addition to a range of fullsize human dolls, Elfdoll have released many types of tiny anthro BJDs, beginning with Catsy. They had a showroom in Glendale, California, opened in August 2007 where they held parties and meetups for BJD enthusiasts. In 2007, LA Weekly described Elfdoll dolls as having \\"detailed, human-like features.\\" China ;Dollzone DollzoneTú vales mucho, muñeca - El País 07/06/2008 was one of the first Chinese BJD doll brands, developed and manufactured by Shenzhen Red Society Toys Ltd. Dollzone make male and female dolls, 1/3 and 1/4 dolls, and BB dolls in 26 cm size. ;Angell Studio Angell Studio was established in HangZhou, China in 2005 as one of the earliest BJD creators in China. In 2013, the company collaborated with makers of Gujian Qitan (古剑奇谭), a popular Chinese MMOG to create ball jointed dolls for the game. Doll Leaves Doll Leaves is a Hong Kong based ball jointed doll company introduced in April, 2010. The company produces both male and female dolls in sizes ranging from 12 cm to 70 cm in a variety of skin tones. Ball-jointed fashion dolls Resin ball-jointed fashion dolls like the Sybarite and JAMIEshow Dolls differ from the typical Asian BJD in several ways. Their main influence is from the collectible American 16 inch vinyl fashion dolls, like Gene Marshall by Ashton-Drake Galleries and now made in resin by JAMIEshow Dolls and Tyler Wentworth by Tonner. Ball-jointed fashion dolls are usually around 16 inches tall, closer to 1/4 scale than the typical 1/3 scale of Asian BJDs. They have more lifelike proportions, smaller heads and eyes, and less childlike, more distinctive facial features Vinyl dolls There are several types of larger 60 cm vinyl dolls in Japan. They are in the same scale as fullsize BJDs, with similar proportions. The two most common types are from Volks and . The first Dollfie Dream body type was strung and had classic ball and socket joints, but the current body has an internal skeleton of hard plastic, as do the Obitsu dolls. The vinyl bodies can, sometimes with some modifications, be combined with a resin BJD head. Vinyl dolls usually have facial features that are more highly stylized after anime and less realistic than the typical resin BJDs. Vinyl dolls are easier to manufacture, machine-made and injection-molded in soft vinyl, and thus lighter and often less expensive than their Japanese resin counterparts, with the exception of their complex skeleton structure which can often justify a higher price. Injection-molded manufacture requires more intensive set-up costs and a higher number of each doll is produced compared to resin dolls, despite this Japanese companies like Volks and Obitsu often have large stock shortages of their vinyl dolls or doll parts.

On the left a rich fuel mixture with no premixed oxygen produces a yellow sooty diffusion flame, and on the right a lean fully oxygen premixed flame produces no soot and the flame color is produced by molecular radical band emission. A premixed flame is a flame formed under certain conditions during the combustion of a premixed charge (also called pre-mixture) of fuel and oxidiser. Since the fuel and oxidiser—the key chemical reactants of combustion—are available throughout a homogeneous stoichiometric premixed charge, the combustion process once initiated sustains itself by way of its own heat release. The majority of the chemical transformation in such a combustion process occurs primarily in a thin interfacial region which separates the unburned and the burned gases. The premixed flame interface propagates through the mixture until the entire charge is depleted. The propagation speed of a premixed flame is known as the flame speed (or burning velocity) which depends on the convection-diffusion- reaction balance within the flame, i.e. on its inner chemical structure. The premixed flame is characterised as laminar or turbulent depending on the velocity distribution in the unburned pre-mixture (which provides the medium of propagation for the flame).  Premixed flame propagation  = Laminar = Under controlled conditions (typically in a laboratory) a laminar flame may be formed in one of several possible flame configurations. The inner structure of a laminar premixed flame is composed of layers over which the decomposition, reaction and complete oxidation of fuel occurs. These chemical processes are much faster than the physical processes such as vortex motion in the flow and, hence, the inner structure of a laminar flame remains intact in most circumstances. The constitutive layers of the inner structure correspond to specified intervals over which the temperature increases from the specified unburned mixture up to as high as the adiabatic flame temperature (AFT). In the presence of volumetric heat transfer and/or aerodynamic stretch, or under the development intrinsic flame instabilities, the extent of reaction and, hence, the temperature attained across the flame may be different from the AFT.  Laminar burning velocity  For a one-step irreversible chemistry, i.e., u_F \\\\rm{F} + u_O \\\\rm{O}_2 \\\\rightarrow \\\\rm{Products}, the planar, adiabatic flame has explicit expression for the burning velocity derived from activation energy asymptotics when the Zel'dovich number \\\\beta\\\\gg 1.

This result is first obtained by T. Mitani in 1980.MITANI, T. (1980). Propagation velocities of two-reactant flames. Combustion Science and Technology, 21(3-4), 175-177. Second order correction to this formula with more complicated transport properties were derived by Forman A. Williams and co-workers in the 80s.Rogg, B., & Williams, F. A. (1985).

On the accuracy of asymptotic flame speed predictions for two-reactant flames. Combustion science and technology, 45(5-6), 317-329. Variations in local propagation speed of a laminar flame arise due to what is called flame stretch. Flame stretch can happen due to the straining by outer flow velocity field or the curvature of flame; the difference in the propagation speed from the corresponding laminar speed is a function of these effects and may be written as: Clavin, P., & Graña-Otero, J. C. (2011). Curved and stretched flames: the two Markstein numbers. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 686, 187-217.Clavin, Paul, and Geoff Searby.

If the premixed charge of gases is not homogeneously mixed, the variations on equivalence ratio may affect the propagation speed of the flame. In some cases, this is desirable as in stratified combustion of blended fuels. A turbulent premixed flame can be assumed to propagate as a surface composed of an ensemble of laminar flames so long as the processes that determine the inner structure of the flame are not affected. Under such conditions, the flame surface is wrinkled by virtue of turbulent motion in the premixed gases increasing the surface area of the flame. The wrinkling process increases the burning velocity of the turbulent premixed flame in comparison to its laminar counterpart. The propagation of such a premixed flame may be analysed using the field equation called as G equationWilliams, F. A. (1985). Turbulent combustion. In The mathematics of combustion (pp. 97-131). Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. for a scalar G as: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot abla G = U_L  abla G, which is defined such that the level-sets of G represent the various interfaces within the premixed flame propagating with a local velocity U_L. This, however, is typically not the case as the propagation speed of the interface (with resect to unburned mixture) varies from point to point due to the aerodynamic stretch induced due to gradients in the velocity field. Under contrasting conditions, however, the inner structure of the premixed flame may be entirely disrupted causing the flame to extinguish either locally (known as local extinction) or globally (known as global extinction or blow-off). Such opposing cases govern the operation of practical combustion devices such as SI engines as well as aero-engine afterburners. The prediction of the extent to which the inner structure of flame is affected in turbulent flow is a topic of extensive research.  Premixed flame configuration  The flow configuration of premixed gases affects the stabilization and burning characteristics of the = Bunsen flame = In a Bunsen flame, a steady flow rate is provided which matches the flame speed so as to stabilize the flame. If the flow rate is below the flame speed, the flame will move upstream until the fuel is consumed or until it encounters a flame holder. If the flow rate is equal to the flame speed, we would expect a stationary flat flame front normal to the flow direction. If the flow rate is above the flame speed, the flame front will become conical such that the component of the velocity vector normal to the flame front is equal to the flame speed. = Stagnation flame = Here, the pre-mixed gases flow in such a way so as to form a region of stagnation (zero velocity) where the flame may be stabilized. = Spherical flame = In this configuration, the flame is typically initiated by way of a spark within a homogeneous pre-mixture. The subsequent propagation of the developed premixed flame occurs as a spherical front until the mixture is transformed entirely or the walls of the combustion vessel are reached.  Applications  Since the equivalence ratio of the premixed gases may be controlled, premixed combustion offers a means to attain low temperatures and, thereby, reduce NOx emissions. Due to improved mixing in comparison with diffusion flames, soot formation is mitigated as well. Premixed combustion has therefore gained significance in recent times. The uses involve lean-premixed-prevaporized (LPP) gas turbines and SI engines.

College career Allen played college baseball for the Boilermakers, where he twice named Team MVP. A winner of 6 varsity letters, Allen was also a quarterback on the football team, selected as Team MVP in 1960. He platooned at quarterback in 1959, leading the Boilermakers to a 5-2-2 record and six weeks in the Top 15. Earning the starting job in 1960, Allen led the Boilermakers to a record of 4-4-1 (2-4 Big Ten) and wins over #12 Notre Dame, Ohio State and #1 Minnesota, the AP and UPI National Champion. The Minnesota and Notre Dame wins were both road wins, while the win over Ohio State earned Allen Sports Illustrated's Offensive back of the Week.

Major League career On Opening Day, April 10, 1962, Allen made his debut for the Minnesota Twins at second base. He was put into a position vacated by Billy Martin a week earlier. Allen had one hit (a triple) in four at-bats on opening day. His rookie performance led to a selection to the 1962 Topps All-Star Rookie Roster and finished 3rd in Rookie of the Year voting, finishing behind Tom Tresh and Buck Rodgers. Allen played five seasons for the Twins and was traded to the Washington Senators with pitcher Camilo Pascual for pitcher Ron Kline. After five seasons in Washington, the Senators moved to Texas and traded him to the New York Yankees. Allen played for New York in 1972, backing up second and third base. He played 17 games for the Yankees in 1973 before being purchased by Montreal. The Expos released him two months later.

The Cadigal originally inhabited the area that they called \\"Cadi\\" that lies south of Port Jackson covering today's Sydney central business district and stretches from South Head to with part of the southern boundary lying on the Cooks River. The Cadigal were coastal people who were dependent on the harbour for providing most of their food. They were one of seven clans living in coastal Sydney who spoke a common language and have become known as the Eora people. \\"Eora\\" simply means \\"people\\" or \\"of this place\\" in their language. The Cadigal language was likely a dialect of the Dharug language. European history Soon after his arrival at Port Jackson, Governor Arthur Phillip estimated the indigenous population of the Sydney district at around 1,500 people, although other estimates range from as low as 200 to as high as 4,000. The Cadigal clan was estimated to have 50-80 people. The invasion of the Sydney area by the British and the subsequent introduction of European diseases including smallpox decimated the Eora people and their neighbours. The disastrous 1789 smallpox epidemic was estimated to have killed about 53% of Sydney's indigenous population, and it was claimed that only three Cadigal people were left alive sometime in 1791, although archaeological evidence suggests that some Cadigal people may have escaped to the Concord area and settled there. Part of the Cadigal territory is in the Inner West local government area of Sydney. In 1994 the Marrickville Aboriginal Consultative Committee was established and the Cadigal Wangal peoples website.

It is located just west of Fifth Avenue between 57th and 58th Streets, next to the Bergdorf Goodman Building and the Plaza Hotel. The building was developed by Sheldon Solow, who named the building after himself and continues to manage and own the building. At 50 stories and in height, it is the 71st tallest building in New York. For decades, the building's only nearby competitor in height was the GM Building, located one block north and east. However, since the completion of 432 Park Avenue in 2015, other skyscrapers along nearby Billionaires' Row have risen considerably higher. Floors above the 23rd floor offer an unobstructed view of Upper Manhattan and a complete view of Central Park and The Plaza Hotel. The building is home to many hedge funds and private equity firms with rents of over $100 per square foot ranking among the most expensive in the city. A July 2016 appraisal valued the building at over $3.4 billion, making the property one of the most valuable office buildings in Manhattan. Tenants left Rental fees at the Solow Building are amongst the most expensive in Manhattan. The Solow Building Company occupies a permanent lease of the top floor. Notable tenants include Chanel (44th fl.) and private equity firms Sycamore Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (42nd fl.), Apollo Management (43rd/48th fl.), Silver Lake Partners (32nd fl.), Providence Equity Partners (49th fl.), and Highland Capital Management (38th fl.). Several law firms and hedge funds occupy a majority of the remaining space, including Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb (50th fl.), Och-Ziff Capital Management (40th fl.), Tiger Global Management (35th fl.), Highbridge Capital Management (27th fl.), and Coatue Management (25th fl.). The corporate offices of Avis Budget Group (37th fl.) are also located in the building.GM Building takes lead in commercial rents.

Architecture and design The concave vertical slope of its facade is similar to another of Bunshaft's creations, the W.R. Grace Building, which was also built in 1974. The initial, rejected design of the Solow building was used in the design for the Grace Building. The sloping facade also evokes the Chase Tower in Chicago. =Amenities= The building features an underground parking garage, retail space (on the north side bordering 58th Street), an underground space occupied by the Brasserie 8½ restaurant, a 2-floor trading area on floors 2-3, a newsstand in the lobby, and 24 high-speed elevators subdivided into sets of floors. The first floor of the building houses a private gallery of billionaire Sheldon Solow's art collection, including works by Franz Kline, Henri Matisse, and Alberto Giacometti, among others. Though managed under the non-profit Solow Art and Architecture Foundation, the gallery is perpetually closed and not open to the public. Legal issues In 1971, Avon Products rented 21 floors, soon increased to 25 floors. The building was shortly being referred to as \\"the Avon building\\" (a title that persists and can still cause confusion). Williams Real Estate, the broker that brought Avon to the deal, sought the commission that they thought had been promised. Cushman & Wakefield, which held a contract with Solow as the building's exclusive rental agent, claimed that they were also owed a commission. Solow refused to pay either, so both sued. After a long jury trial in State Supreme Court, Solow was ordered to pay commissions of $150,000 to Cushman & Wakefield and $1.7 million to Williams, the largest such award in New York real estate history.Court of Appeals decision in Williams v.

This church merged with the Congregational Christian Churches denomination in 1957 to create the United Church of Christ. Beliefs Centered in the Midwest, the denomination was made of German Protestant congregations of mixed Lutheran and Reformed heritage, reflecting the 1817 union of those traditions in Prussia (and subsequently in other areas of Germany). This union, both in Germany and in the United States, was deeply influenced by pietism. The denomination accepted the Heidelberg Catechism of the Reformed and Luther's Small Catechism and Augsburg Confession of the Lutherans as its confessional documents; where there was disagreement the individual believer had freedom to believe either tradition. The church eventually developed its own Evangelical Catechism, reflecting its \\"united\\" faith. In keeping with core Protestant convictions, the Bible was considered the ultimate standard of its faith. History The German Evangelical Church Society of the West (Der Deutsche Evangelische Kirchenverein des Westens) was founded on October 15, 1840, at Deutsche Evangelische St. Johannes Gemeinde Zu Gravois Settlement Missouri. St. Johns Evangelical United Church of Christ (as it is known today) had been founded in 1838 by newly arrived German immigrants. They were living in a wilderness farming community a day's journey south of St. Louis. The small congregation built a church out of logs by hand on this hill. A memorial was erected in 1925 commemorating the founding of the Evangelical Synod of North America and still stands today in front of the church. At the 1866 General Convention in Indianapolis, Indiana, the name Evangelical Synod of the West was adopted. In 1868, the governance was changed to one in which delegates to the convention were elected by district. Previously, the full membership attended each convention. In 1872, the synod merged with the Synod of the East (covering western New York and Ohio) and the Synod of the Northwest (covering Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan), becoming the German Evangelical Synod of North America. By 1877 the synod had 324 pastors. The denomination established Eden Theological Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri, for the training of its clergy; today, Eden remains a seminary of the United Church of Christ. In the early 20th century, the Evangelical Synod became active in the ecumenical movement, joining the Federal Council of Churches and pursuing church union. In 1934, it had 281,598 members and 1,227 pastors. At that time it joined with another denomination of German background, the Reformed Church in the United States, forming the Evangelical and Reformed Church. This church united, in turn, in 1957, with the General Council of Congregational Christian Churches to form the United Church of Christ. Notable people and congregations The oldest Evangelical Synod congregations are believed to be Femme Osage United Church of Christ near Augusta, Missouri; Bethlehem United Church of Christ in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Saint John's-Saint Luke Evangelical and Reformed United Church of Christ in Detroit, Michigan; or The United Church in Washington, D.C., each of which were founded in 1833. The oldest Lutheran church in Chicago, Illinois, was an Evangelical Synod congregation. The Deutsche Evangelische Lutherische Sankt Paulus Gemeinde (German Evangelical Lutheran St. Pauls Congregation) was founded in 1843 and is now known as St. Pauls United Church of Christ. Zion Evangelical and Reformed Church, St. Joseph, Missouri, was founded 1858 by Rev. Heckmann to serve the families who had come from various parts of Germany who were part Lutheran, part United and part Reformed. The new congregation was named The United Evangelical Protestant Congregation of St. Joseph, Missouri. The Zion Evangelical Church in Cleveland, Ohio, was founded in 1867. The merger of the Evangelical Synod and the Reformed Church in the United States took place in this building on June 26–27, 1934. Reinhold Niebuhr and H. Richard Niebuhr, two siblings who developed strong reputations during the mid-20th century for their theological acumen, were both members of the Evangelical Synod and its successors.

The term in Japanese conveys a sense of regret over waste; the exclamation \\"Mottainai!\\" can translate as \\"What a waste!\\" Japanese environmentalists have used the term to encourage people to \\"reduce, reuse and recycle\\", and Kenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai used the term at the United Nations as a slogan to promote environmental protection.  Etymology, usage, and translation  Kōjien, widely considered the most authoritative Japanese dictionary, lists three definitions for the word mottainai (classical Japanese terminal form mottainashi): (1) inexpedient or reprehensible towards a god, buddha, noble or the like; (2) awe-inspiring and unmerited/undeserved, used to express thanks; (3) an expression of regret at the full value of something not being put to good use. In contemporary Japanese, mottainai is most commonly used to indicate that something is being discarded needlessly, or to express regret at such a fact. , then a professor at Nagano University, noted that the definition (3) in Kōjien was the one used most frequently by modern Japanese. The second sense is seen in Japanese newspapers when they defer to members of the imperial family as having been present at such-and- such an event, not necessarily implying wastefulness but rather gratitude or awe. ', another Japanese dictionary, gives a similar ordering of these definitions. Hasegawa traces this increase in the frequency of meaning (3) to a historical semantic shift in which the original meaning, meaning (1), became less prominent. Citing the Kyoto University Japanese literature scholar , Hasegawa states that the word originated as slang in the Kamakura period, and that by the mid 15th century had perhaps already acquired the meanings of (2) and (3). Two frequently-cited early examples of usages of mottainashi, given in both Kōjien and Daigenkai, are the Genpei Jōsuiki and the Taiheiki. A form of the word, motaina (モタイナ) appears in the late-14th or early-15th century Noh play ', apparently in a sense close to (1). The word nai in mottainai resembles a Japanese negative (\\"there is no mottai\\"), but may have originally been used as an emphatic (\\"tremendous mottai\\"). Mottai itself is a noun appearing as such in, for example, the dictionary ', which dates to 1444. Daigenkai gives buttai as an alternate reading of the word, and it appears written with the kanji 勿躰, 物體, 勿體, 物体, or 勿体. It means (i) the shape/form of a thing or (ii) something that is, or the fact of being, impressive or imposing (モノモノシキコト monomonoshiki koto). The compound that is pronounced as mottai in Japanese appears in Sino-Japanese dictionaries as a Chinese word in a sense similar to (ii), but mottainashi does not, as it is an indigenous Japanese word. The 18th-century Kokugaku philologist Motoori Norinaga, in the preface to his 1798 treatise Tamaarare ('Ice Crystals (like) Jewels':玉あられ) designed to stir people up from their sleepy acquiescence in acquired customs that were not authentically native, and was critical of the use of the word to express gratitude. He felt its use for such a purpose (along with those of kajikenashi and osoreōi) was vitiated by its ultimate derivation from imitating forms of Chinese rhetoric and greetings.Markus Rüttermann, \\"So That We Can Study Letter-Writing\\": The Concept of Epistolary Etiquette in Premodern Japan, Journal of the International Research Center for Japanese Studies, 2006 18,1 pp.57-128,86. In his 1934 essay Nihon-seishin to Bukkyō, the Buddhologist Katō Totsudō (加藤咄堂:1870-1949) included the \\"aversion to wastefulness\\" (mottainai) in a putative series of what he considered to be \\"core Japanese personality traits\\".Chūō Bukkyō 1934 18/3 pp.1-12,11-12 cited in Ives below.Christopher Ives, The Mobilization of Doctrine: Buddhist Contributions to Imperial Ideology in Modern Japan, Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 26, 1/2 Spring 1999 pp.83-106,90:'Katō Totsudō also identifies purportedly core Japanese personality traits of aversion to wastefulness (mottainai: 勿体無い), gratitude (arigatai: 有難い) and sympathy (ki no doku: 気の毒) with the Three Mental Attitudes of laity set forth in the Upāsaka–śīla sūtra the mind of poverty (hinkyūshin:貧窮心) the mind of requiring blessings (hōonshin:報恩心) and the mind of merit (kudokushin:功徳心).' Mottainai originated as a Buddhist term, though this fact is not common knowledge even in Japan. The word later become connected to the Shinto concept that all objects have souls.  Modern Japanese environmentalism  In November 2002, the English-language, Japan- based magazine Look Japan ran a cover story entitled \\"Restyling Japan: Revival of the 'Mottainai' Spirit\\", documenting the motivation amongst volunteers in a \\"toy hospital\\" in Japan to \\"develop in children the habit of looking after their possessions\\", the re-emergence of repair shops specializing in repairing household appliances or children's clothes, the recycling of PET bottles and other materials, the collection of waste edible oil, and more generally the efforts to stop the trend of throwing away everything that can no longer be used, i.e. the efforts of reviving \\"the spirit of mottainai\\". In that context, Hitoshi Chiba, the author, described mottainai as follows: In a 2014 paper on an apparent increase in interest in the idea of mottainai in early 21st- century Japan, historian Eiko Maruko Siniawer summarized the views of several Japanese writers who claimed that mottainai was a specifically Buddhist concept. She also cited a number of views of Japanese authors who believed that it was a uniquely Japanese \\"contribution to the world\\", whose views she characterized as mostly being \\"deeply rooted in cultural generalizations, essentialisms, and disdainful comparisons between countries\\".  Use by Wangari Maathai  Nobel Prize winner Wangari Maathai has used the word mottainai in an environmental protection campaign At a session of the United Nations, Kenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai introduced the word mottainai as a slogan for environmental protection. According to Mizue Sasaki, Maathai worked to popularize the word mottainai in places outside Japan. At the 2009 United Nations Summit on Climate Change, she said, \\"Even at personal level, we can all reduce, re-use and recycle, what is embraced as Mottainai in Japan, a concept that also calls us to express gratitude, to respect and to avoid wastage.\\" Cited in Siniawer, 2014, p. 177.

It has been serialized in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday from August 1994 to July 2010 and has been collected in 78 tankōbon volumes. The series has been adapted into an anime series produced by NHK and Studio Hibari titled (using katakana instead of the manga's English characters). The first episode aired in November 2004. The series ran for six seasons, and the final episode originally aired in September 2010. It is an animated film telling the story between the first and second seasons released in December 2008. Two OVAs were released in December 2011 and January 2012. The OVAs adapted the World Series chapter, though this was skipped in the TV series. In 1996, Major received the Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen. The manga had over 54 million copies in print as of February 2018, making it one of the best-selling manga series. It was followed by a sequel titled Major 2nd, which started its serialization in Weekly Shōnen Sunday in March 2015. Plot The story of Major follows the life of Gorō Honda from kindergarten to his career as a professional baseball player. The story focuses on how the main protagonist overcomes tremendous challenges. Subsections are divided according to the official website's story sections.Official website by Shōnen Sunday =Kindergarten ~ First grade= Gorō's father, Shigeharu Honda, is a baseball pitcher bouncing between the major and minor league teams of the NPB. Nonetheless, Gorō looks up to his father and wishes to be a professional baseball player just like him. Gorō's mother, Chiaki Honda, died from an unknown disease two years before the events of the story. Aside from his father, Gorō is very close to two other people: Momoko Hoshino and Toshiya Sato. Momoko is Gorō's kindergarten teacher and watches out for Gorō, as there are no other children of Gorō's age in the class. Toshiya is another child from Gorō's neighborhood, the only one of Gorō's age, and to whom Gorō taught baseball. The father and son are struck a cruel blow when an arm injury prevents Honda from continuing his baseball career as a pitcher. Gorō is especially shaken by the fact that his father cannot pursue his career as a baseball player. For Honda, Gorō and baseball are all he has left in his life. For his son's sake, Honda takes his best friend's advice, revives his batting instincts, and successfully transforms into a slugger. Amidst these struggles, Momoko is drawn deeper and deeper into the family's life. Eventually, Honda proposes to Momoko. Right when Honda establishes himself in a major league team, the Yokohama Marine Stars, the Tokyo Giants sign a contract with the American MLB player Joe Gibson, famous for his huge physical build and hard fastballs. When the Marine Stars with Honda and the Giants with Gibson finally meet on the field, Gibson strikes out every single Marine Stars batter, except for Honda. At his second at-bat, Honda hits a home run off Gibson's pitch. After Honda's home run, the Marine Stars coach launches a series of bunt attacks, scoring additional runs, and psychologically shaking up Gibson who considers the tactic unsportsmanlike. By Honda's third at-bat, Gibson has completely lost his mental focus, and accidentally pitches a dead ball that strikes Honda's head. The umpire immediately calls Gibson off the mound, though Honda quickly gets back onto his feet and continues with the game. Honda's excellent play makes him the headline of major newspapers. The next morning, Honda dies due to internal bleeding in his skull, leaving his heartbroken son and fiancé in mourning. =Little League= Three years have passed since Momoko adopted Gorō as her son upon Honda's death. When Gorō reaches fourth grade, he is finally old enough to join the local little league team, the Mifune Dolphins. However, the local kids are mostly interested in soccer, and Gorō has to get his new school friends to join him to have enough members to keep the baseball team from being dismantled. Gorō shows himself to be an exceptionally gifted baseball player. The team coach recommends that Gorō join the nearby Yokohama Little team instead, which has better players, coaching, and resources. When Gorō visits the team, he discovers that not only is his childhood friend Toshiya at Yokohama Little, but his father, Shigeharu Honda, was a member of the Yokohama Little team with the current coach when they were younger. Gorō finds himself torn; following in his father's footsteps would mean abandoning the friends he asked to join the Mifune Dolphins. Gorō has a big fight with Momoko over the issue, and Momoko seeks advice from Hideki Shigeno, Honda's old friend and teammate. While meeting with Shigeno, Momoko coughs up blood and is hospitalized. While it turns out to just be a gastric ulcer, it makes Gorō realize that the living people in his life are much more important than the dead ones. Meanwhile, Joe Gibson has just returned to the MLB after pitching in Japan for three years. He offers Gorō an all-expenses-paid invitation to travel to America and watch the MLB All-Star game, where Gibson will be the starting pitcher for the National League. At the game, not a single of the AL's top players can touch Gibson's pitches, and Gibson earns a standing ovation from the audience. Gibson explains that this was his way to show Gorō how great a slugger Honda had been since Honda had hit a home run off Gibson's best pitch. After the game, Gibson offers to allow Gorō to throw a ball at him. Gorō responds that he will postpone this \\"punishment\\" until the day he can pitch as well as Gibson. Back in Japan, with renewed determination, Gorō leads the Mifune Dolphins through various trials and practice matches to defeat Yokohama Little, the best team in the region. In the end, the Dolphins do defeat Yokohama Little, but Gorō is injured in the process, making him unable to play for a few months. At the end of the season, Gorō's adoptive mother marries Hideki Shigeno, and the new family plans to move to Fukuoka after Shigeno is traded from the Marine Stars. Gorō, unable to face his teammates, leaves without saying goodbye, leaving them heartbroken. =Junior High= Gorō moves back to Mifune when his stepfather is traded back to the Blue Oceans. Gorō finds his little league friends grown up and attending Mifune East Junior High School. Gorō surprises his friends when he tells them that he has been playing soccer and doesn't plan on playing for the junior high baseball team due to a shoulder injury he sustained in Fukuoka. Gorō reveals to his friends that he has switched to being a southpaw pitcher. At first, Gorō is not interested in playing baseball because he wants to play with hard balls, not the rubber ones used in the junior high league. During a match where Mifune East Junior High faces Mifune West Junior High, Gorō takes to the mound after seeing Mifune West insult his friends. In the game, Gorō's team manages a comeback victory. Together, Gorō and his friend Komori Daisuke rebuild the junior high baseball team. Eventually, they enter the regional junior high tournament, where Gorō once again finds himself playing against his friend and rival Toshiya Sato, who plays on the Tomonoura Junior High School team. Mifune eventually beats Tomonoura in a close game. Gorō's friendship with Toshiya goes downhill when Toshiya decides to go to Kaido High School, where Gorō has no desire to go. A Kaido scout urges Gorō to enter Kaido, but Gorō refuses the offer, saying as \\"as long as Toshiya goes to Kaido, I won't enter Kaido.\\" The scout tells Toshiya to quit applying for Kaido, as they want Gorō instead. Gorō and Toshiya make a bet: their two teams will play against each other, and the winner will attend Kaido. Mifune East wins, but Toshiya and Gorō decide to take on Kaido together. After a tournament defeat against Kaido Junior High, Gorō prepares to attend Kaido High to improve his pitching. Gorō, Komori, and Toshiya try out for the baseball team of the prestigious private high school. Komori is disqualified forced to attend Mifune High instead. Gorō and Toshiya make it through the first round of tryouts. Gorō then succeeds at an academic examination designed to test his determination. =Kaido High School= Immediately after they graduate middle school, Gorō and Toshiya are sent to Dream Island, where they undergo six months of hard training and make some new friends. Gorō then proceeds to the Atsugi campus, where he defeats a scholarship team. Gorō and Toshiya make the junior varsity team and spend a year and a half together as teammates. However, in their second year, Gorō reveals that his sincere desire is to challenge the excellent players of Kaido instead of playing on the same team as them. Toshiya is hurt by Gorō's decision but respects him for it. Gorō leads the junior varsity team to victory in a scrimmage against the varsity team and then quits Kaido High School to play for another team. =Seishu High School= Gorō has returned home after quitting Kaido. On arrival, his mother voices her dissatisfaction with the fact that he did not consult with her about his departure. She insists that Gorō be accountable for his actions and accept the responsibility to pay the application fee at any school that he chooses to enroll. Gorō's enrollment is rejected by several schools due to the Kaido assistant coach, Egashira, threatening to sue other schools for accepting him. Gorō is finally able to avoid Egashira's interference by enrolling at Seishuu High School. A girls-only school until just two years prior, Seishuu does not have a baseball team. Gorō enrolls, determined to create a baseball team from scratch. After he has enough committed players, Gorō and the team enter the summer tournament. First, Gorō and his new teammates play an exhibition match with the second-string players from Kaido. In the game, Gorō's foot gets injured when a rival player steps on it in a supposed accident. Despite the injury, Gorō and his team persist in the summer tournament and manage to reach the quarterfinals against Kaido. After a close game that goes into extra innings, Kaido wins and moves on to Koshien, while Gorō collapses from exhaustion. =Minor League Baseball= Despite losing the match against Kaido, Gorō attracted the eyes of many scouts during his time with the Seishuu High School team, including some from the Yokohama Marine Stars and the Tokyo Warriors. However, upon learning that Joe Gibson is still pitching in the MLB and has dedicated his 300-win season to his \\"young friend in Japan,\\" Gorō loses interest in Japanese professional baseball and leaves for America to try out for the MLB. Meanwhile, Sato is recruited by the Tokyo Warriors, while Mayumura is hired by the Yokohama Marine Stars. Gorō's fastball, while ineffective against Major League sluggers, allows him to start in Triple-A instead of the rookie league. At first, he joins the Cougars but is soon released after a fight with Joe Gibson Jr. from the Oklahoma Falcons. Eventually, Gorō joins the Memphis Bats. In Triple-A, Gorō finds a new rival: Joe Gibson Jr, son of Joe Gibson and an outstanding slugger. Junior views the death of Gorō's father as the cause of a tragedy that occurred on his own family, and he challenges Gorō to a bet: If Junior can hit a home run off Gorō, Gorō is to return to Japan and never set foot on American soil again. On the other hand, if Gorō can strike out Junior, then Junior will visit Gorō's father's grave and apologize for his insults. Gorō manages to strike out Junior with his increasingly deadly fastball. The Bats go on to win the Triple-A playoffs. =Baseball World Cup= After the baseball season is over, Gorō returns to Japan. Shimizu finally admits her feelings for Gorō, and they became a couple. Meanwhile, Gorō learns from Toshi that there is going to be a Baseball World Cup the following year hosted in America, and for the first time, Major League players will be allowed to compete in it. Due to Gorō's impressive performance in the practice match between Rookies and the All-Star Japan team, he is selected as a replacement pitcher starting the second round of preliminaries. Gorō pitches as the closer against Venezuela and South Korea, earning a win and a save, respectively. Then, Mayumura earns a win pitching as closer against the Dominican Republic, advancing Japan to the semi-finals. Shimizu comes to America to cheer Gorō on and encounters Toshiya's younger sister, Miho Sato. The day before the semi-finals match against Cuba, Toshiya runs into his sister, and the traumatic memories of being abandoned by his parents seven years prior are rekindled. Toshiya's body goes into involuntary shock, and he is hospitalized. Miho feels guilty about the incident, but Toshiya calls her and asks her to watch the next game. Toshiya makes several excellent plays against Cuba's aggressive offense in the semi-finals, and Gorō gets the win as the closer. After the Cuba game, Gibson Jr. reveals to the Team USA's manager, as well as to Gorō, that his father, Joe Gibson, has angina pectoris. Junior hopes that the manager and Gorō might be able to dissuade Gibson from getting on the mound and potentially killing himself. However, with the players mostly in an \\"exhibition game\\" mentality, Gibson takes the mound in the 8th inning of the USA vs. Venezuela semi-finals, risking his life to raise the spirits of his teammates. The following day, Gibson collapses during a practice session, and Gorō rushes to the hospital to see him. Gibson reveals to Gorō that, in a chance meeting with Momoko 10 years prior, he asked her why she had not accepted any monetary compensation from him. Momoko simply asks Gibson to remain a top-class baseball player until Gorō grows up so that Gorō can be proud of having a father who hit a home run off of such a great pitcher. Momoko's words were the pillar that supported and drove Gibson all these years. He felt that if he did not play in the Baseball World Cup and face Gorō on the mound, he would have failed Gorō and Momoko. Gorō comforts Gibson, telling him that he has done enough, and urging him to watch Gorō and Junior's showdown on TV. The Japan vs. USA finals game begins with Japan taking a five-run lead, prompting Gibson to leave the hospital and go to the stadium to cheer his teammates on. Japan sends out Gorō in the 8th inning to protect their 1-run lead, but Junior hits a home run off Gorō's fastball. The game goes into extra innings. Gorō and Junior keep up consecutive no-hit innings until the 15th inning, in which Toshiya's bat breaks during an at-bat. The bat's flying shrapnel hits Gibson in the heart. Gibson catches the ball and uses his remaining strength to throw out a runner. He collapses soon after. Gorō, determined to strike out Gibson Jr, pitches the fastest pitch of his life: a fastball. However, Junior hits a home-run off the pitch, sealing the World Championship for the USA team. After the finals, Gorō loses his desire to play baseball and returns to Japan instead of going to Florida for spring training. But upon seeing his old teammates play in Japan, Gorō rekindles his desire to play and leaves to join the Hornets in Florida. =Major League Baseball= As the new MLB season begins, Gorō performs exceptionally well for the Hornets in exhibition matches. In his first official MLB game, he pitches a no-hit no-run game up until the 8th inning, when he suddenly loses his control. In his second game, his pitches start to go wild in the 5th inning. Suspecting \\"yips,\\" the team's catcher, Keene, stops Gorō from voluntarily stepping off the mound, gambling on the chance that Gorō will overcome his struggles. Gorō throws at the batter's head and is ejected by the umpire. In his third game, Gorō is unable to retire a single batter. He is removed from the game in the first inning and sent back to the Triple-A Bats to improve his play. Believing that Gorō's defeat at the hands of Gibson Jr. was the cause of his yips, the Hornets send Gorō to Billy Oliver, a sports psychologist, for treatment. After Gorō recovers from his yips, he feels aimless, leading to performance struggles. Later, Gibson retires after a defeat at the hands of Gorō and the Hornets. Gibson's departure from baseball is treated as voluntary retirement, but in reality, Gibson takes the opportunity to start from scratch. He signs a minor league contract with Double-A Bulls. Gibson fights his way back up to the majors and waits for Gorō to rechallenge him. Ultimately, the Hornets lose to the Salmons, ending their World Series chances. Gorō heads back to Japan to take a rest and solidify his relationship with Shimizu. A flash-forward eight years shows Gorō being brought out to close the last game of the World Series, where the Hornets face off against the Raiders. During the match, Shimizu is shown giving birth to her and Gorō's first child. The ending finds Gibson Jr. against Gorō in one final face-off. =Return to Japan= Following the events of Season 6, the Major OVA finds Gorō, after a splendid fourteen-year career, forced to retire from the Hornets. He can no longer pitch due to a shoulder injury despite surgery and rehabilitation. He rejects some offers of coaching positions and decides to return to Japan to continue playing baseball as a hitter and fielder. Before leaving, Gorō promises Toshi he will meet him again on the field as a batting opponent in the Major League, and Sato pledges to wait for Gorō. Gorō takes two years to train himself as a fielder and a hitter. Afterward, he joins the Blue Oceans and returns to being a professional player, inspiring his daughter and his son as his father had inspired him. Characters =Main= ; / : : The story's main character is Honda Gorō, a talented baseball player by the age of 5. His love of the game stems from his father, who played for the Yokohama Marine Stars. Gorō's mother died when he was three, leaving him with nothing but baseball and his father. Wanting nothing more than to follow in his father's footsteps, Gorō strives to become a professional ballplayer. Gorō also believes that the only way to make his father happy is to become a professional baseball player himself. He thrives on challenges and leverages his competitive mindset as he practices. He makes friends quickly, as people are drawn to his personality and his love of the game. :Tragedy again strikes Gorō at the age of 6, when he loses his father in a horrible accident in a game against MLB pitcher Joe Gibson. From then on, Gorō aims to join the MLB and someday challenge Gibson. He is taken in by Momoko, his kindergarten teacher, and his late father's lover. After Momoko gets married, Gorō's name is changed to Shigeno Gorō. ; : :Shigeharu is an up- and-coming baseball pitcher for the Marine Stars. He is a widower and lives with his son, Gorō. An elbow injury threatens to end his baseball career early on until his friend and teammate, Shigeno, suggests that he try hitting. He develops feelings for Gorō's kindergarten teacher and nearly marries her. However, he tragically dies after being struck in the head by a pitch from Joe Gibson, an American pitcher who came to Japan from the MLB. During his childhood years, he played for the Yokohama Little league, and later Koshien high school alongside Shigeno. ; : :Chiaki Honda was the deceased wife of Shigeharu Honda. ; / : :Momoko was Gorō's nursery school teacher when he was younger. After Gorō left nursery school, she dated his dad Shigeharu and was engaged to him at the time of his death. She adopted Gorō and raises him as a single parent until she marries Hideki Shigeno several years later. Her name changes to Momoko Shigeno. She then has children of her own, a boy named Shingo and a girl named Chiharu. ; : :Hideki was an ace pitcher for the Yokohama Marine Stars. He and Shigeharu were buddies since high school, and Shigeno had been an irreplaceable friend to the Honda's. When Shigeharu was down due to his arm injury, Hideki sparked the thought for him to transform into a slugger instead. When Shigeharu died, he became reacquainted with Momoko and Goro (they last met at Honda's funeral), giving baseball-related advice to Goro. Then in early Spring three years later, he married Momoko and adopted Goro as his son. Around 1996, his son Shingo was born. In 1996 the Yokohama Marine Stars traded him to the Fukuoka Eagles (Hawks in the Movie). Then in 2000, the Yokohama got him back. However, following a period of bad performances, Shigeno announced his retirement after that season. For the remainder of the season, Shigeno's performance picked up again. His back number, #17, retired with him. (in the anime, the bad performances and retirement occurred during the 2002 season instead) After retiring from professional baseball, he became a sports commentator. In 2001, his daughter Chiharu was born. In 2005, Shigeno was recruited as the head coach as well as the pitcher coach of the Japan National Team for the Baseball World Cup. ; : :Initially, Sato was a boy who was forced by his mother to focus on his studies to become a responsible adult. While Gorō was playing catch by himself one time, he saw Toshi staring from his window. At first, Toshi did not want to play catch with Gorō, but Gorō went to Toshi's house and convinced Toshi to play with him. He develops a love of the game equal to Gorō and becomes a talented catcher. Told by his mother that if he wanted to play baseball, he had to play for the best team, Toshiya went to play as a catcher for Yokohama Little League, which is the area's best team. Gorō runs into him again (Gorō moved away after his father's fiancée adopted him), and the two begin a rivalry as intense as their friendship. He plays against Gorō on Yokohama Little and again as the catcher of Tomonoura Junior High School's team. In between the time, Toshiya's family abandoned him due to debt problems, and he began living with his grandparents. Swearing to go pro so he could one day repay the debt he has from his grandparents. In the Junior years, Toshi wanted to get into Kaido High because he believed that was the best path to turn pro. He was later told by the Kaido scouts to give up so Gorō would join. Though Toshi had misunderstood Gorō's idea and thought Gorō did not want to play baseball with him. After the defeat to Mifune East, Toshi regained his confidence in Gorō and wished that they would go to the same high school together and defeat Kaido. Later Gorō told Toshi to go to Kaido with him to improve their skills. They try out for Kaido High School's baseball team together with Komori and become teammates on Kaido's Junior Varsity team for a year and a half. :During his years in Kaido, Toshi had lost contact with Gorō after his departure from Kaido. And when Gorō finally meets Toshi again, Toshi had completely forgotten of Gorō's team thinking they were only just surviving in the tournament. During the match against Seishu, Toshi was confident in defeating Gorō's team, though he was amazed by Gorō pitching he was injured. Toshiya went on a fantastic winning in the Koshien Tournament. Forming a battery with Mayumura and was Kaido's fourth batter. After high school, he had been scouted by the Tokyo Warriors team and won the Best New Player award. During the Baseball World Cup, he first joined Team Japan as DH, but later took on the catcher mask. At first, he had some trouble during the first match, though with Gorō's help, Toshi's confidence slowly increased. ; : :Kaoru is in Gorō's class in elementary school and eventually begins to play little league baseball on the Mifune Dolphins Little League after an argument with Gorō where she sees his passion for the game. She was also the first person Gorō recruited to the Mifune Dolphins. In the finals against Yokohama, she was the catcher to replace the injured Komori. Already in elementary school, she began to have feelings for Gorō. In Junior High School, she switches to softball and becomes captain of the Mifune East Junior High team. Seeming, she still had a grudge against baseball because Gorō introduced it to her. Initially, she plans to follow Gorō, whom she has a crush on, to Kaido High School. However, she changes her mind after she discovers Kaido does not have a softball team and after Gorō tells her to follow her love of softball. She attended Seishu High School, the one Gorō later attends. She told her little brother Taiga to join Seishu's baseball club, seeming the great \\"baseball fanatic\\" was there. After high school, she attended Kyowa University. During the winter break of her freshman year, Gorō confesses to Kaoru, and they are going out. If Gorō was suggested as a baseball fanatic, Shimizu was said to be a softball fanatic. And now, she is shown that she is married to Gorō and has two children. ; : : Joe Gibson is the man responsible for the death of Gorō's birth father. The incident remained a heavy cross weighed upon him, driving him to remain one of the top pitchers in the MLB so that Honda, by comparison, would be seen as an even more significant player. Due to this incident, he began to have family problems as his family did not fit in Japan. His son Joe Gibson Jr. started to have a grudge against him as his son believed Gibson and Honda Shigeharu created the reason for the family breakdown. He later returned to America after the death of his wife and daughter. He continued pitching after the age of 40 and earning over 300 wins. He stated he was waiting for a Japanese boy to join the Major League to challenge him. For the Baseball World Cup, he was Team USA's ace pitcher, although at that time, he was diagnosed with angina pectoris, and the doctor warned he might die if he continues pitching. However, Gibson may feel that dying on the mound pitching his best would be the only way to truly make up to Gorō, Momoko, and the deceased Honda. His surgery was successful. Gibson also stated, \\"I too once had a great rival, though he is now dead because of me.\\" =Supporting= ; : : Komori was Honda's catcher since his earlier days as a little leaguer back when they were in Mifune Dolphins along with Sawamura and Shimizu. At first, he was being bullied by Sawamura but was helped by Gorō and solved the problem. He continued to catch for Gorō when he returned from Fukuoka in Mifune East Middle School but ended when Mayumura eliminated them single-handedly in their game with Kaido Affiliate. In season 3, when Gorō left Kaido and entered Seishuu, they become rivals where Gorō eventually won. After High school, Komori went on to play for his Uni as their pinch hitter. After high school, Komori went on to have a regular job and became the coach of the Mifune Dolphins. Goro's daughter joins the team with Komori as the coach during OVA 1. ; : : Kaoru's brother. First seen back in season 1, where he asked his sister if baseball was fun, he returned in season 3 as a new member of the Seishuu Baseball Team, where he played as a shortstop. With his excellent skill and speed, he helped Gorō in challenging Kaido. Besides that, he also helped to take over the mound when Egashira injured gorō during their practice game with Kaido. He was a smartmouth kid who believed in defeat but later changed his opinion after watching Gorō time and time again pitching with an injured foot. Later on, he became the captain of the Seishuu Baseball Team to challenge Kaido once again with his new teammates. Declaring their goal is to win at Koshien. Though at first, he did not have the confidence and decided to learn to throw the gyroball so he could give new members the belief of going to Koshien. Though later, Gorō told him that he should make a team that suited him rather than follow in Gorō's footsteps. He is the 1st batter (batting left-handed) and plays shortstop. ; : : Initially, Ryota is a bully in elementary school, pushing Komori. Gorō and Shimizu stand up to him, and he eventually backs down after Gorō hits him for trying to throw his baseball glove into the river. He soon realizes that he doesn't have any real friends and asks Gorō if he can play baseball with him, Shimizu and Komori. He started off playing soccer but changes to baseball so he could play in Little League with Gorō and the others. In junior high, he went back to soccer and was the captain of the team. In season 6, we learn that he injured his knee and could not continue playing. He remains friends with Komori, Shimizu, and Gorō. ; : : Introduced in the Junior High story arc, Yoshitaka Yamane is on the Mifune Junior High School team but uses it to cut class with some other friends that follow him. He and his friends beat up Komori after he tells them that they have to quit if they aren't going to contribute to the team and frightened the remaining players into quitting, too. When Gorō returns and confronts him, Yamane reveals that he hates baseball because he cannot play it anymore. He was injured the year before and cannot throw the ball with his right arm. Gorō, who suffered a similar injury, teaches Yamane to throw left-handed, and he rejoins the team, playing first base. He goes on to Mifune High School with Komori, where he became the pitcher. ; : :The son of Joe Gibson, Junior, is of the same age as Gorō. When Junior's parents divorced because his mother could not stand life in Japan, whereas Gibson wanted to remain in Japan pitching until he had found out how to make up for killing Honda, Junior stayed with his father in Japan. When his mother and sister died in a traffic accident in America, Junior became resentful towards his father and the deceased Honda. His motivation to play baseball was fueled by the desire to defeat his father. He is an extremely talented batter, being able to switch hit. He played for the AAA Oklahoma Falcons, the MLB team Texas Raiders, as well as the USA Team during the Baseball World Cup. He hit the walk-off home run against Gorō 103 mph pitch to lead the USA to the world cup victory. He plays third base. ;Ken Mayumura : :Introduced in season 2, he has a forward attitude. His personality is straightforward and to the point, often coming off as cold. He appears to be in complete control of his emotions at all times, including when facing established and more experienced players. Others see his pre-game ritual of sitting in a bathroom stall while listening to music as getting him in the right frame of mind to pitch, but in actuality, he does it because he is anxious and helps him focus his anxiety. Mayumura's pitch was as fast as Goro's and is also a gyroballer just like Shigeno. His goals are to achieve all possible individual achievements in Japanese Baseball before moving onto the Majors. In the anime, he plays for NPB's Yokohama Blue Oceans[Anime]/Orix Blue Wave [Manga] as a starting pitcher. Still, at the end of season 6 and in OVA 2: World Series, it is shown that Mayumura becomes the ace pitcher for the Texas Raiders and forms a battery with Jeff Keene. ;Tashiro : : ;Fujii : : =Others= ;Jeff Keene :Jeff Keene is the catcher for both Indiana Hornets and Memphis Bats, he seems to be quiet almost all the time and doesn't like \\"chit-chatting.\\" He is always serious and is a catcher and batter.

Her friend initially expresses interest in becoming the manager of the baseball club because she has a crush on the captain. Ayane is bumped by someone on the stairs and is falling backward, but the captain catches her. She seems to have developed a crush in response to this and asks her friend if more than one person can be a manager. After noticing her glowing look, Ayane's friend declares that she will back off and instead support Ayane's love. ;Megumi Koga :Megumi Koga (Japanese order Koga Megumi) is a girl in the film in the class 5-1 with Goro.

The squadron, known as the \\"Wolfpack\\", is based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 16 (MAG-16) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). In the past 25 years, the Wolfpack has participated in fourteen Marine Expeditionary Units, Special Operations Capable [MEU (SOC)] Deployments and has been the recipient of many prestigious awards, including the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Phoenix Award for outstanding maintenance (1987), the Fleet Marine Force Pacific (FMFPAC) Annual Aviation Safety Award (1986), the Mike Yunck Award for best overall squadron in the Third Marine Aircraft Wing (3d MAW) (1988, 1999, 2010), Meritorious Unit Citation (MUC) (1986), Navy and Marine Corps Unit Commendation (NUC) (1992, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009), Presidential Unit Citation (PUC) (2010), the Keith B.

History =Early years= Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 466 (HMH-466), the “Wolfpack,” was commissioned on 30 November 1984, as the Marine Corps’ third, and Marine Aircraft Group 16's (MAG-16), second CH-53E squadron. By December 1984, the squadron was 180 Marines strong and growing, and had accepted two of sixteen CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters from Sikorsky Aircraft Company in Stratford, Connecticut. The Wolfpack conducted its first operational flight on 19 December 1984, and by 30 June 1985, the squadron had accepted eleven of its sixteen aircraft. In its first seven months as an operational squadron, HMH-466 had flown 1100 hours, carried 1000 passengers, and lifted 175,000 pounds of cargo. Delivery of aircraft continued until 5 August 1985, when the squadron received its sixteenth CH-53E. =Gulf War & the 1990s= Older squadron logo. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the Wolfpack became the first CH-53E squadron to deploy to Saudi Arabia. While in support of operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM, HMH-466 recovered downed aircraft, conducted the first Night Vision Goggle (NVG) troop insertion, and provided heavy lift support from port facilities to staging areas in preparation for the ground phase of the operation. Upon cessation of hostilities, the Wolfpack returned to Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Tustin having sustained no losses of personnel or aircraft. In May 1992, the Wolfpack embarked upon its first Unit Deployment Program (UDP) to MAG-36, MCAS Futenma, Okinawa, Japan and became the second CH-53E squadron deployed to the Western Pacific. In addition, the squadron detached four aircraft to Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 161 (HMM-161) in support of the 11th MEU (SOC). In November 1992, HMH-466 returned to MAG-16 thus concluding the first of many extremely successful six-month UDP rotations. Squadron photo celebrating 60,000 flight hours From December 1992 to March 1993, the Wolfpack detached four aircraft to Somalia in support of Operation RESTORE HOPE. In November 1993, the squadron celebrated its ninth birthday. During this month, the Wolfpack attained 25,000 flight hours, becoming the only CH-53E squadron to reach this class “A” mishap-free milestone. The squadron again deployed to the Western Pacific in May 1994, detaching four aircraft to both HMM-161 and HMM-262 in support of the 15th and 31st MEU (SOC)s, respectively.- The four CH-53 E's of 15th MEU ACE were detached to Entebbe, Uganda as part of Operation Support Hope- the refugee relief operation for the Rwandan refugees. On 29 May 1995, the Wolfpack became the first Marine Corps CH-53E squadron to exceed 30,000 mishap-free flight hours. During October 1995, the Wolfpack detached four aircraft to HMM-163 in support of the 13th MEU (SOC) while the main body of the squadron departed for Okinawa, Japan in May 1996. During the deployment a CH-53E Fleet wide grounding for faulty main rotor head swash plates kept the squadron hard at work rebuilding eight aircraft. Upon the completion of the UDP in November 1996, the squadron returned to MCAS Tustin. Following a successful Okinawa deployment, the Wolfpack continued to support Marine Corps forces throughout the continental United States (CONUS). In January and February 1997, the Wolfpack supported various units at the Mountain Warfare Training Center (MWTC) in Bridgeport, California. October was spent at 29 Palms, California, supporting the Combined Arms Exercise (CAX), and December concluded with the squadron focused on preparations for the next deployment to Okinawa. With another UDP under way, the squadron also supported three separate MEU (SOC)s with detachments stretched across the globe. In conjunction with the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) direction, the squadron relocated from MCAS Tustin to MCAS Miramar following their return from UDP. =Early 2000s= In February 2000 the Wolfpack again detached four aircraft to the 13th MEU (SOC). Deploying with HMM-161 aboard the USS Tarawa the detachment performed missions in East Timor, as well as supporting the withdrawal of the USS Cole from the Persian Gulf after the ship was attacked by terrorists while at port in Yemen. Throughout 2001, the Wolfpack participated in three CAXs and supported two Weapons and Tactics Instructor Courses (WTI). In May 2001 the Wolfpack also supported President Bush during his first visit to California as President. Later that year, the squadron shifted its focus to aircrew training for the upcoming 11th MEU (SOC) detachment as well as another UDP to Okinawa in June 2002. The UDP proved to be a diverse deployment for the squadron. Flying across the Western Pacific rim, the heavy lift community was well represented by the Wolfpack in operations such as BALAKITAN in the Philippines and COBRA GOLD in Thailand. Upon its return to MCAS Miramar in July 2003, the Wolfpack had completed a thirteen-month deployment, the longest in squadron history. In August 2003, the Wolfpack supported HMX-1 and President Bush during his visit to Los Alamitos, California and later in the year provided six aircraft and the requisite maintainers to support WTI 1-04. Tragedy struck the San Diego community in October 2003, as 400,000 acres of land were burned by wildfires. Rising to help the community, the Wolfpack launched six aircraft, each carrying 1320 gallon water buckets, to provide much needed assistance to beleaguered fire fighters as they quelled the expansive blaze. December was a month of preparation as the squadron set its eyes on training. Spending time in Indian Springs, Nevada and Yuma, Arizona the Wolfpack sharpened their skills as they readied to deploy to Iraq. =The Global War on Terror= In January 2004, the squadron embarked sixteen aircraft aboard the USS Boxer for transport to the Persian Gulf. The Wolfpack carried eleven 13,000 pound tugs and offloaded HMM-261 from the USS Bataan before flying all sixteen aircraft 350 miles north to Al Asad Airbase in Central Iraq. While in Iraq, the squadron became the first USMC frag-capable squadron in country for Combined Joint Task Force 7 (CJTF-7). While deployed, the squadron flew 3,774.9 hours, and transported over 8,530 passengers and 6.4 million pounds of cargo in support Operation IRAQI FREEDOM II-1 (OIF). In addition, the squadron was recognized by the Secretary of the Navy for surpassing the 50,000 hour class “A” mishap-free milestone during the deployment. On 21 September 2005 the Wolfpack departed MCAS Miramar for another deployment in support of OIF 04-06.2. The squadron accomplished all of its missions to include High Value Individual raids, Very Important Person lifts like that of the Secretary of Defense, in Amman, Jordan, Tactical Bulk Fuel Delivery System (TBFDS) refueling missions, Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel via external lift, and general support of ground forces operating throughout Iraq. And on 18 February 2006 the Wolfpack achieved another noteworthy milestone by surpassing 60,000 class “A” mishap-free flight hours. In April 2007 the Wolfpack again departed CONUS for Al Asad, Iraq. Shortly into the deployment the squadron welcomed its four aircraft from the 13th MEU (SOC) as they were detached from the 13th MEU still operating in the Middle East to support Multi-National Forces-West (MNF-W) in Iraq, a first in the CH-53E community. Throughout the deployment the squadron completed a multitude of missions and safely returned home to MCAS Miramar in November 2007 after flying an impressive 3,700 combat flight hours and 2,400 sorties, while transporting over 3.4 million pounds of cargo and 18,000 passengers. The squadron again left for Iraq in October 2008 and from Kuwait the squadron saw a four aircraft detachment depart to Kandahar, Afghanistan. In Iraq, the Wolfpack attached a four aircraft detachment from the 26th MEU and fully integrated the detachment into the squadron. Less than a month into operations in Iraq, the Wolfpack was called upon to provide dynamic support to another area of the country and sent four aircraft and personnel to the Expeditionary Airfield of Sahl Sinjar in northwestern Iraq for over eight weeks where the Wolfpack provided heavy lift and general support to I MEF. Throughout the rest of the deployment the squadron successfully completed a multitude of missions in different areas of the world and returned home safely in March 2009. HMH-466 departed CONUS in January 2012 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom Afghanistan. HMH-466 was reinforced by HMH-366 from Cherry Point, NC to make a full squadron. During the deployment HMH-466/366 to form a cohesive unit called themselves HMH- America and used the call sign \\"Cyclops\\". Over the course of 7 months the squadron participated in over 175 named operations, 4,500 combat flight hours supporting USMC operations and ISAF partners including the Afgan National Army, Australia, Great Brittan, and Georgia in RC Southwest.

MBS has an additional office in Pitt Street, Sydney, and a program enquiries office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. History MBS began teaching in 1955 when the University of Melbourne offered Australia’s first residential executive education program in the summer of that year. Its first Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree was awarded in 1965, which was also the first MBA degree awarded in Australia. During the 1980s, MBS was awarded the status of a National Management School by the Australian Government and the Graduate School of Management was established within the University of Melbourne. In 1989, it was re-organized again, this time as the Graduate School of Management Ltd: a non- profit company limited by guarantee and managed by a Board of Directors which includes the chairs and directors of leading Australian corporations. This organization structure has helped create a major link between the university and those who have a responsibility for management. It is currently co-owned by the University of Melbourne (45%) and Australian businesses (55%). In 2004, Melbourne Business School Limited merged with Mt Eliza Business School, which was established in 1957, becoming the largest management education business school in Australia. In July 2009, the school announced that it was the subject of a proposed merger with the Graduate School of Management at the University of Melbourne. However, the proposal was decided not to proceed following opposition from MBS members in September 2009. In October 2012 the school signed a collaboration deal with University of Melbourne, sharing resources but retaining the school's independence and the authority of the board. MBS closed and sold its Mt Eliza campus in 2016, to concentrate on expanding the Carlton campus.

This may be accompanied by a snapping or popping noise and pain or discomfort. Pain often decreases with rest and diminished activity. Snapping hip syndrome is commonly classified by the location of the snapping as either extra-articular or intra-articular.  Symptoms  In some cases, an audible snapping or popping noise as the tendon at the hip flexor crease moves from flexion (knee toward waist) to extension (knee down and hip joint straightened). It can be painless. After extended exercise, pain or discomfort may be present caused by inflammation of the iliopsoas bursae. Pain often decreases with rest and diminished activity. Symptoms usually last months or years without treatment and can be very painful. =Extra-articular= *Lateral extra articular The more common lateral extra-articular type of snapping hip syndrome occurs when the iliotibial band, tensor fasciae latae, or gluteus medius tendon slides back and forth across the greater trochanter. This normal action becomes a snapping hip syndrome when one of these connective tissue bands thickens and catches with motion. The underlying bursa may also become inflamed, causing a painful external snapping hip syndrome. *Medial extra-articular Less commonly, the iliopsoas tendon catches on the anterior inferior iliac spine, the lesser trochanter, or the iliopectineal ridge during hip extension, as the tendon moves from an anterior lateral (front, side) to a posterior medial (back, middle) position. With overuse, the resultant friction may eventually cause painful symptoms, resulting in muscle trauma, bursitis, or inflammation in the area. =Intra-articular= Because the iliopsoas or hip flexor crosses directly over the anterior superior labrum of the hip, an intra-articular hip derangement (i.e. labral tears, hip impingement, loose bodies) can lead to an effusion that subsequently produces internal snapping hip symptoms.  Causes  The causes of snapping hip syndrome are not fully understood, and some confusion exists within the medical community regarding the causation. The onset is often insidious with reports of a \\"non-painful\\" sensation or audible snapping, clicking, or popping with certain activities. Individuals often ignore the \\"snapping\\" sensation, which may lead to future discomfort with activity. Athletes appear to have an increased risk of snapping hip syndrome due to repetitive and physically demanding movements. Among athletes such as ballet dancers, gymnasts, horse riders, track and field athletes and soccer players, military training, or any vigorous exerciser, repeated hip flexion can lead to injury. In excessive weightlifting or running, the cause is usually attributed to extreme thickening of the tendons in the hip region. Snapping hip syndrome most often occurs in people who are 15 to 40 years old. = Extra-articular = Extra- articular snapping hip syndrome is commonly associated with leg length difference (usually the long side is symptomatic), tightness in the iliotibial band (ITB) on the involved side, weakness in hip abductors and external rotators, poor lumbopelvic stability and abnormal foot mechanics (overpronation). Popping during external snapping hip (lateral-extra articular), occurs when the thickened posterior aspect of the ITB or the anterior gluteus maximus rubs over the greater trochanter as the hip is extended. Internal snapping hip (medial-extra articular) is usually described by the patient as a snapping or locking of the hip with an audible snap and occurs when the iliopsoas tendon snaps over underlying bony prominences. Almost half of patients with internal snapping hip also have inter-articular pathology. = Intra-articular= The causes of intra-articular snapping hip syndrome seem to be broadly similar to those of the extra-articular type, but often include an underlying mechanical problem in the lower extremity. The pain associated with the internal variety tends to be more intense and therefore more debilitating than with the external variety. Intra-articular snapping hip syndrome is often indicative of injury such as a torn acetabular labrum, ligamentum teres tears, loose bodies, articular cartilage damage, or synovial chondromatosis (cartilage formations in the synovial membrane of the joint). Diagnostic * Ultrasound during hip motion may visualize tendon subluxation and any accompanying bursitis when evaluating for iliopsoas involvement in medial extra-articular cases. * MRI can sometimes identify intra-articular causes of snapping hip syndrome.  Treatment  This condition is usually curable with appropriate treatment, or sometimes it heals spontaneously. If it is painless, there is little cause for concern. Correcting any contributing biomechanical abnormalities and stretching tightened muscles, such as the iliopsoas muscle or iliotibial band, is the goal of treatment to prevent recurrence. Referral to an appropriate professional for an accurate diagnosis is necessary if self treatment is not successful or the injury is interfering with normal activities. Medical treatment of the condition requires determination of the underlying pathology and tailoring therapy to the cause. The examiner may check muscle-tendon length and strength, perform joint mobility testing, and palpate the affected hip over the greater trochanter for lateral symptoms during an activity such as walking. =Self-treatment= A self-treatment recommended by the U.S. Army for a soft tissue injury of the iliopsoas muscle treatment, like for other soft tissue injuries, is a HI-RICE (Hydration, Ibuprofen, Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) regimen lasting for at least 48 to 72 hours after the onset of pain. \\"Rest\\" includes such commonsense prescriptions as avoiding running or hiking (especially on hills), and avoiding exercises such as jumping jacks, sit-ups or leg lifts/flutter kicks. Stretching of the tight structures (piriformis, hip abductor, and hip flexor muscle) may alleviate the symptoms. The involved muscle is stretched (for 30 seconds), repeated three times separated by 30 second to 1 minute rest periods, in sets performed two times daily for six to eight weeks. This should allow one to progress back into jogging until symptoms disappear. =Injection based treatments= Injections are usually focused on the iliopsoas bursa. Corticosteroid injections are common, but usually only last weeks to months. In addition, corticosteroid side effects can include weight gain, weakening of the surrounding tissues, and even osteoporosis, with regular use. Cellular based therapy may have a role in future injection based treatments, though there is no current research proving the effectiveness of these therapies. = Surgical treatment = If medicine or physical therapy is ineffective or abnormal structures are found, surgery may be recommended. Surgical treatment is rarely necessary unless intra-articular pathology is present. In patients with persistently painful iliopsoas symptoms surgical release of the contracted iliopsoas tendon has been used since 1984. Iliopsoas and iliotibial band lengthening can be done arthroscopically. Postop, these patients will usually undergo extensive physical therapy; regaining full strength may take up to 9–12 months.  Rehabilitation  Patients may require intermittent NSAID therapy or simple analgesics as they progress in activities. If persistent pain caused by bursitis continues, a corticosteroid injection may be beneficial. = Physical therapy or athletic training therapy and rehabilitation = Both active and passive stretching exercises that include hip and knee extension should be the focus of the program. Stretching the hip into extension and limiting excessive knee flexion avoids placing the rectus femoris in a position of passive insufficiency, thereby maximizing the stretch to the iliopsoas tendon. Strengthening exercises for the hip flexors may also be an appropriate component of the program. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug regimen as well as activity modification or activity progression (or both) may be used. Once symptoms have decreased a maintenance program of stretching and strengthening can be initiated. Light aerobic activity (warmup) followed by stretching and strengthening of the proper hamstring, hip flexors, and iliotibial band length is important for reducing recurrences. Conservative measures may resolve the problem in six to eight weeks. Massage or self- myofascial release may be an effective intervention for external snapping hip syndromes. It’s suggested that using soft-tissue modalities to target the iliopsoas for medial extra-articulate snapping hip syndrome and gluteus maximus, tensor fasciae latae, and ITB complex for lateral extras-articulate napping hip syndrome may be effective in treating symptoms of snapping hip syndrome.

He was the assistant coach of the Sydney Roosters in 2018 when the club won the premiership that year. He was also previously the head coach of the Parramatta Eels, South Sydney Rabbitohs and Wests Tigers clubs in the National Rugby League (NRL). A New South Wales State of Origin representative goal-kicking halfback of the 1990s and early 2000s, Taylor set a number of point-scoring and appearance records in the National Rugby League during a twelve-year career with the Western Suburbs Magpies, North Sydney Bears, Northern Eagles and Parramatta Eels. Background Taylor was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. He spent his junior years at Green Valley JRLFC and the Ashcroft Stallions JRLFC, in Sydney's south-western suburbs. He first attended Ashcroft High School before spending his late teenage years St Gregory's College, Campbelltown. Playing career Taylor played for Sydney's Western Suburbs Magpies from 1990 to 1993. Starting from the bench for the first 2 games of the 1990 season, Taylor spent most of the season playing five-eighth outside Ivan Henjak. Still a teenager, he was often called \\"baby-faced\\". In what was a poor season for the Magpies, Taylor was described as \\"the best of the babies\\" in the NSWRL for the season. 1991 saw the arrival of coach Warren Ryan and big-name players Andrew Farrar, David Gillespie and Paul Langmack at the Magpies. Taylor, now playing halfback, lead the team to its first semi-finals in nine years after starring in a play-off for fifth spot. Wests made the semis again in 1992, but Taylor was temporarily benched mid-season. Ongoing conflict with Warren Ryan saw Taylor seeking an early release from his contract. The release was not granted and Taylor remained for the 1993 season. Taylor said, \\"The press came up with some interesting reasons why I wanted to leave, but I prefer to keep most of them to myself because they have been pretty well resolved. One reason, however, was I thought our style of play was too restrictive, too structured and by the end of the year, very predictable. I wasn't the only player to think that way. Ryan stated in 1993, \\"I've made every effort to rectify the things that were buggering him up last year. I did the same thing with Benny Elias when I was at Balmain. Jason is very, very talented mentally. We've rectified the problem we had and taken every step to resurrect his game. And to his credit when we told him he wouldn't be released he wasn't negative at all. He's done a lot of sprint work and he's worked hard.\\" Later that season, Ryan suspended Taylor from first grade after an \\"outburst\\" aimed at teammate Paul Langmack at half- time in a match. The Wests Magpies board later overturned the suspension. In 1993, Taylor made his representative debut with City Origin, playing from the bench. Described as, \\"the form player of the premiership\\" in 1994, Country Rugby League general manager David Barnhill claimed that Taylor should be eligible to play for the Country team due to his time spent at St. Gregorys. He ended up playing halfback for City for the next two years. Taylor was also selected to play for the New South Wales team in the 1993 State of Origin series. He was chosen on the bench for all three games, but did not take the field in the first game of the series. Coach Phil Gould said, \\"if anything happened to Ricky we needed a capable and experienced halfback to go in with a similar game-type to Ricky. Jason's kicking and passing game is along the same lines and would allow fellows like Daley and Fittler the same room as if they were playing with Ricky.\\" Taylor played with the North Sydney Bears from 1994 to 1999, While at North Sydney, Taylor played a pivotal role in the team and set numerous records. Taylor also won The Rothmans medal in 1996 as being the game's best and fairest player. Taylor has scored more points for the North Sydney Bears than any other player to have been at the club with 1274 points.http://www.smh.com.au/news/lhqnews/taylor-made-coachs-career-highs-and- lows/2009/09/17/1252780409410.htmlhttp://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/jason- taylor/summary.htmlhttp://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/teams/north-sydney- bears/players.html?pos=⩝=points In January 1997, Taylor was escorted from the Sydney Cricket Ground following unruly behavior at an Australian Cricket match. It was alleged that Taylor and some of his North Sydney teammates had been backing up from a bucks party the night before when they proceeded to urinate in plastic cups and throw it over patrons during a Mexican wave. Taylor was then axed as an Australia Day ambassador by Central Coast organisers.http://www.smh.com.au/news/lhqnews/taylor-made-coachs-career-highs- and-lows/2009/09/17/1252780409410.html In the 1997 preliminary final against the Newcastle Knights, Taylor missed 3 out of 5 conversions in North Sydney's 17-12 defeat. The most crucial when scores were locked at 12-12 after Taylor set up Michael Buettner for a try moments before. With 3 minutes remaining, Norths had a chance to play in their first grand final in 54 years if Taylor could kick that goal. The normally reliable Taylor missed the conversion and Newcastle player Matthew Johns went down the other end of the field and kicked a field goal to make it 13-12. With seconds remaining Norths frantically threw the ball around the field, Owen Craigie swooped on a loose pass and raced away to score the match winning try to make it 17-12. This was North Sydney's 4th preliminary final defeat in 6 years.http://www.weststigersforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=26739 In the 1998 NRL season, Taylor made 26 appearances as Norths finished 5th on the table. Taylor played in both finals matches against Parramatta and Canterbury-Bankstown which ended in defeat. Taylor captained Norths in what would be the club's last season in the top grade. He played in North Sydney's last game in the NRL which came against North Queensland at the Willows Sports Complex. Taylor scored 2 tries and kicked 3 goals in a 28-18 victory. Taylor remained with North Sydney for their merger with the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles to form the Northern Eagles in 2000, but was released by the club at the end of the season. Without a club for the next year, Taylor wrote a letter to Parramatta Eels coach Brian Smith and joined the club for the 2001 season. His performance that year was described as, \\"close to the greatest comeback ever in big-time rugby league.\\" Taylor's last ever match was for Parramatta at in their 2001 NRL grand final loss to the Newcastle Knights. Whilst at Parramatta Taylor set a new point-scoring record, breaking Daryl Halligan's mark of 2,034. Between 1992 and 2000 (and across three clubs) Taylor played 194 games in succession, also a standing record, 20 games clear of Hazem El Masri's 174. Taylor retired with the record for most career points in the National Rugby League and its predecessors. He scored 2,107 first grade career points, a mark later surpassed by Newcastle Knights halfback Andrew Johns in July 2006, then again by Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs winger Hazem El Masri in March 2009, then once again by Melbourne Storm hooker Cameron Smith in April 2019. He retired holding the record for most first grade career goals at 942 a mark later surpassed by Cameron Smith in May 2016. Taylor was the Australian Rugby League's top point-scorer in seasons 1996 and 1997. Taylor as coach of the Rabbitohs Coaching career Previously the assistant coach at the Parramatta Eels, he was appointed as head coach in May 2006 for the remainder of the season after Brian Smith left the club following the announcement of his sacking for season 2007. When Taylor took over as Parramatta coach, the club had only won 2 of its first 8 games. Taylor then guided Parramatta on a 9 game winning streak as the club finished in 8th place on the table and qualified for the finals. Parramatta were eliminated in the first week of the finals losing to minor premiers Melbourne 12-6. It was already planned that from 2007 Taylor was to join the South Sydney Rabbitohs as an assistant coach. In August 2006, it was announced he would replace Shaun McRae as head coach of the struggling South Sydney club. In his first year at Souths he took them to a top eight finish qualifying them for the finals. It was the first time since 1989 that Souths reached the finals. On 17 September 2009 it was announced that Taylor had been sacked as coach by the club due to an altercation with second-rower David Fa'alogo during end-of-season celebrations. A visibly upset Taylor appeared on the NRL Footy Show later that evening and on a number of sport programs on Sydney radio in the following days to explain his conduct and subsequent dismay at his sacking.Taylor at a loss to explain sacking - League - Sport - news.ninemsn.com.au In 2011, Taylor returned to coaching with the Sydney Roosters Toyota Cup (Under-20s) team. His team made the semis in both 2011 and 2012. With the sacking of Brian Smith at the end of 2012, Taylor was appointed assistant coach to new first grade coach Trent Robinson for the 2013 season. On 29 September 2014 Taylor was announced as the head coach of the Wests Tigers for the next three seasons, starting from 2015.Wests Tigers announce new head coach, NRL.com official website, 29 September 2014 On 20 March 2017 Taylor was sacked as Wests Tigers coach. After being terminated by Wests Tigers, it was revealed that Taylor was relieved of his duties partly due to poor results on the field but also for the fact that what the media had described as \\"The Big 4\\" at the club would not sign new contracts if Taylor was still the coach going forwards into the future. Taylor's time at Wests was also marred by an ugly feud with long time player Robbie Farah and resulted in Farah being demoted to reserve grade and then subsequently leaving the club altogether.https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl- premiership/teams/tigers/wests-tigers-to-sack-coach-jason-taylor-following- loss-to-raiders/news-story/b2032d55bd7487bcb578ccf3f11100cd On 8 May 2017, the Sydney Roosters confirmed that Jason Taylor will be on-boarded as an assistant coach. Roosters coach, Trent Robinson, quickly clarified that Mr Taylor would be an assistant to the coach. On 5 September 2018, Taylor was announced as the new head coach of his former club the North Sydney Bears.https://www.northsydneybears.com.au/north-sydney-bears-announce-new- alliance-with-the-sydney-roosters/ In Taylor's first year in charge at Norths, he guided the club to a third placed finish at the end of the 2019 Canterbury Cup NSW regular season as they qualified for the finals for the first time since 2017. North Sydney would go on to be eliminated from the 2019 Canterbury Cup NSW finals series as they lost both matches against South Sydney and Newtown.

History Students published its first issue in tabloid format on November 24, 1893, from offices in the Academic Building on North Campus. In the spring of 1895, the UGA faculty ordered that publication of the paper be discontinued; however, students revived the paper that fall as an independent venture with no oversight by the University. The private venture's success that Fall upset the faculty, and they took back control in January 1896 with the Athletic Association in charge of overseeing the paper. Published weekly, The Red & Black was the official organ of the Athletic Council from 1896 to 1928. The paper advertised athletic competitions and reported on the culture of the University. In 1928, the paper's administration moved under the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication as a laboratory for its students. It was being published semiweekly in 1968 when it changed to a broadsheet format and moved its offices to the new journalism building on campus. In 1980, after numerous run-ins with the University's administrators, The Red & Black became independent of the University a second time, left to support itself through advertising. Its office moved off-campus, and its publication was directed by volunteer staff and student writers. In 1991, publication was expanded from four to five days a week. Until fall of 2011, the paper had a Monday to Friday circulation of 17,000 during the academic year and generally published in one section. However, each Thursday the paper produced a \\"Music Notes\\" section, which chronicled the local music scene and highlights shows and festivals in Athens. On Fridays during football season, the paper publishes the \\"First & Goal\\" section to provide in-depth coverage of the Georgia Bulldogs football team. The paper is published once a week during summer session, when it has a circulation of 8,500. The newspaper was awarded the Pacemaker Award in 2010 in both the newspaper and online categories, and was a newspaper Pacemaker finalist in 2009. It marks the fifth newspaper Pacemaker for The Red & Black, which it has previously won in 1935, 1937, 1941 and 1972. =Present day= On August 15, 2011, The Red & Black released a special edition announcing a shift in news distribution that it called \\"a media revolution.\\"redandblack.com The student paper announced that it would primarily focus on its online content, to better keep up with demand for mobile news access.

He choreographed fight and action scenes for over 80 Hindi films including Mr. Natwarlal, Ek Khiladi Bawan Pattey, Phool Aur Kaante, Jigar, Dil Kya Kare etc. He also acted in the 1981 film Kranti in a small role. Veeru Devgan even ventured into direction with 1999 film Hindustan Ki Kasam which starred his son Ajay Devgn, Amitabh Bachchan, Manisha Koirala and Sushmita Sen. Death Veeru Devgan died in the morning of 27 May 2019 in Mumbai, aged 85. Veeru Devgan had not been well for a while and old age and poor health made his health condition worse. He was suffering from breathing problems after which he was immediately admitted to the Surya Hospital, Santa Cruz. However, his condition got critical and resulted in cardiac arrest. Releasing an official statement, the family said, 'With profound grief and sorrow, we regret to inform that Veeru Devgan, father of Ajay Devgan died. Funeral was held at Vile Parle West Crematorium at 6:00 pm on 27 May 2019.'

Citizenship of Sweden is based primarily on the principle of jus sanguinis. In other words, citizenship is conferred primarily by birth to a Swedish parent, irrespective of place of birth. In general, children born in Sweden to foreign parents do not acquire Swedish citizenship at birth, although if they remain resident in Sweden they may become Swedish later on. Swedish law was significantly amended with effect from 1 July 2001 and from that date, dual citizenship is permitted without restriction. Birth A child born after 1 April 2015 acquires Swedish citizenship automatically if: * one of the parents is a Swedish citizen at the time of the child's birth * a deceased parent of the child was a Swedish citizen upon their death A child born before 1 April 2015 acquired Swedish citizenship at birth if: * the child's father was a Swedish citizen and was married to the child's mother; or, * the child's father was a Swedish citizen, the child was born out of wedlock, and the child was born in Sweden; or, * the child's mother was a Swedish citizen and it was born on or after 1 July 1979. For example, a child born to a Swedish father and a non-Swedish mother will not be Swedish if either: its parents are not married to each other or if they were not married when it was conceived and it was born outside of Sweden, unless the father sends notification to an embassy or consulate with the child's passport, birth certificate, proof of his own citizenship at the time of the birth, and a certificate of paternity. A child who is born abroad and whose father is a Swedish citizen (not married to the child's mother, and the mother is not Swedish) will acquire Swedish citizenship when the parents get married, provided the child is aged under 18. =Older legislation= The law that governed the transmission of citizenship before the Citizenship Act of 2001 was the Citizenship Act of 1894 (law number 71, 1 October 1894), with intervening reforms in 1924, 1950, and 1979. http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/CountryReports/Sweden.pdf Adoption A child who is aged under 12 and who has been adopted by a Swedish citizen automatically receives Swedish citizenship upon adoption if * the child has been adopted as the result of a decision taken in Sweden or in another Nordic Council country * the child has been adopted as the result of a decision taken abroad and approved in Sweden by the Swedish Intercountry Adoptions Authority * the adoption is valid under Swedish law. The adoption must have been officially decided or approved after 30 June 1992. A child aged 12 or more at the time of adoption may acquire Swedish citizenship by application. Naturalization as a Swedish citizen Swedish citizenship ceremony inside Stockholm City Hall on 6 June 2011. Swedish citizenship can be acquired by naturalization, also known as citizenship by application. A foreigner may be granted Swedish citizenship upon meeting certain requirements, including: * holding a permanent residence permit, unless a citizen of a Nordic Council country. For citizens of European Economic Area nations, a right of residence or limited residence permits for five years equate to a permanent residence permit. A number of exemptions apply to the residence period: * the residence period is reduced to 4 years for recognised refugees and stateless persons. * citizens of other Nordic Council countries are only required to have two years' residence in Sweden. * former Swedish citizens * those employed on Swedish ships * persons employed abroad by Swedish corporations * a person with previous long residence in Sweden For those married to, living in a registered partnership with or cohabiting with a Swedish citizen, they can apply for Swedish citizenship after three years. In these cases, they must have been living together for the past two years. It is not enough to be married to one another, they must also live together. Sweden imposes no requirements on Swedish language abilities or knowledge about Swedish history or culture, the only other country in Europe without similar requirement is Ireland. Citizenship by notification Notification is a simpler method of acquiring Swedish citizenship (i.e. simplified naturalisation). Those not eligible for notification may still be eligible for naturalisation by application. Categories of persons eligible for citizenship by notification include: =Stateless persons= A stateless person may acquire Swedish citizenship by notification if that person has a permanent resident permit and falls into one of the following categories: * born in Sweden and aged less than five; * aged under 18 and in the custody of a Swedish citizen; * aged 18 or 19 and resident in Sweden since age 15. =Young persons resident in Sweden= Swedish citizenship may be acquired by notification by young persons who hold a permanent resident permit in the following cases: * aged under 18 and resident in Sweden for three years * aged 18 or 19, where the person has been resident in Sweden since turning 15. =Former Swedish citizens= Former Swedish citizens who hold permanent resident permits may acquire Swedish citizenship by notification if the following conditions are fulfilled: * aged 18 or over * resident in Sweden for 10 years preceding age 18. * resident in Sweden for the 2 years preceding the application Those former Swedish citizens who are citizens of other Nordic countries may acquire Swedish citizenship by notification immediately upon resuming residence in Sweden. =Citizens of Nordic countries= Citizens of other Nordic Council countries (Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Finland) may be eligible for Swedish citizenship by notification in the following cases: * aged 18 or over * the other Nordic citizenship has been acquired other than by naturalisation * 2 years' residence in Sweden * And a person who has lived in Sweden for 5 years, who can speak and write Swedish, can be qualified to obtain citizenship provided there is no criminal history. Loss of Swedish citizenship Although dual citizenship is permitted, a Swedish citizen who was born outside Sweden and is a citizen of another country will lose Swedish citizenship at age 22 unless he or she is granted approval to retain Swedish citizenship between ages 18–21. However, approval is not required if: * the person has ever been domiciled in Sweden; or * the person has ever been in Sweden under circumstances that indicate a link with Sweden. In such cases the Swedish citizenship is retained. Dual citizenship With effect from 1 July 2001, a Swedish citizen acquiring a foreign citizenship does not lose Swedish citizenship. Former Swedish citizens who lost Swedish citizenship prior to this date (upon naturalisation in another country) were given a two-year period to re-acquire Swedish citizenship by declaration. Children of former Swedish citizens were also eligible to acquire Swedish citizenship by declaration. The deadline for submission of applications was 30 June 2003. The changes to the law also mean that foreigners seeking naturalisation as a Swedish citizen do not need to renounce their former citizenship. They may retain it if the law of the other country permits them to do so. Swedish citizens who nonetheless hold Japanese citizenship must normally, under Japan's nationality law, notify Japan's Ministry of Justice, before turning 22, whether to keep their Swedish or Japanese citizenship. Prior to 1 July 2001, Swedish citizens were still able to legally hold dual citizenship in certain circumstances, for example, if the other citizenship was acquired automatically at birth. A Swedish passport Citizenship of the European Union Because Sweden forms part of the European Union, Swedish citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Swedish embassy, Swedish citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.Article 20(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.Rights abroad: Right to consular protection: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). Antigua and Barbuda (UK), Barbados (UK), Belize (UK), Central African Republic (France), Comoros (France), Gambia (UK), Guyana (UK), Liberia (Germany), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (UK), San Marino (Italy), São Tomé and Príncipe (Portugal), Solomon Islands (UK), Timor- Leste (Portugal), Vanuatu (France) Swedish citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty. Travel freedom of Swedish citizens Visa requirements for Swedish citizens Visa requirements for Swedish citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Sweden. As of May 2018, Swedish citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 187 countries and territories, ranking the Swedish passport third in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index. The Swedish nationality is ranked seventh in The Quality of Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well.

It displaced the Pontiac Bonneville, which had served as Pontiac's top-trim model since 1958. The Bonneville was not discontinued, but shifted downward in the model lineup, effectively replacing the discontinued Pontiac Executive. The Grand Ville and Bonneville shared a number of trim and design elements that distinguished them from the Catalina, and the 1971-72 Grand Villes were built on a stretched-wheelbase version of the GM \\"B\\" platform that nevertheless had identical interior dimensions to all other full-size Pontiacs. In addition to more luxurious interior trimmings, the Grand Ville had distinctive chrome trim at the front and rear to set it apart from the rest of the Pontiac line. For 1974 only, the Grand Ville had unique parking lights which wrapped around the corner of the front fender. The car was often sold with deluxe appearance options, such as sport wheels and vinyl tops. Rear fender skirts were featured on the 1973 to 1975 models. Standard equipment on Grand Ville models included a 455 cubic-inch V8 (for 1975, a 400 cubic-inch V8 was standard and the 455 optional), Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission, power steering and power front disc brakes. Popular options included air conditioning, power windows and driver's seat, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, AM/FM stereo with tape deck and much more. One of the rarest options available on Grand Villes and other full-sized Pontiacs during this period was the adjustable brake and accelerator pedals offered from 1974 to 1976. The Grand Ville enjoyed moderate success from 1971 to 1973. However, the oil crisis of late 1973 and early 1974 led to gasoline shortages, long lines at filling stations, and high fuel prices. These factors sharply cut into full-sized car sales in 1974 as buyers moved towards smaller cars. For 1975, the Grand Ville became the Grand Ville Brougham and included more standard equipment than in previous years, such as power windows and a carpeted trunk. This would be the final year for the Grand Ville series, which included Pontiac's last convertible until 1983. For 1976, the Grand Ville nameplate was dropped and the lineup was renamed Bonneville Brougham, returning that nameplate back to its former flagship status. Grand Ville convertibles were rare, with production never exceeding 5,000 units per year during the model run. From 1973 to 1975 the Grand Ville was Pontiac's only full-size convertible offering; 1971 and 1972 full-size Pontiac convertibles were offered in the entry level Catalina line as well. (There were no convertible Bonnevilles after the 1970 model year.) The rarest of the Grand Ville convertibles was the 1971 model with just under 1,800 examples built. The 1975 model was the most plentiful with just over 4,500 cars built, as being the final year of production increased demand. The Grand Ville convertible had the lowest production amongst its corporate cousins, the Oldsmobile 88 Royale, Buick LeSabre/Centurion, Chevrolet Caprice Classic and Cadillac Eldorado convertible lines.

Their first season was a difficult one, including an emphatical 0–12 loss to Millwall Athletic in the 1891–92 season. They played in the London League in the 1896–97 season, in which they finished 7th of seven. They were suspended towards the end of the season, and the points from their two remaining games went to their opponents, Thames Ironworks (Who later changed their name to West Ham), who as a result finished second. Another noteworthy fixtures in the early days were a 1:0 defeat and 1:1 draw against Tottenham Hotspur in 1894. At this time the Club had 90 members who were all, exclusively, Welsh. The team was soon to be nicknamed \\"Preston North End\\" because \\"they were never beaten\\". This was due in part to having 6 Welsh internationals playing for the team, including Price White, Jeffrey Jones, Sam Gillam (1890–93), Robert Lee Roberts (1891-1902) and the charismatic Leigh Richmond Roose (1900–01), who was capped three times while playing for 'Welsh'. Whilst a number of its rivals developed into professional clubs London Welsh retained its amateur status and when the Amateur Football Alliance reconstituted the Southern Olympian League in 1921, following the First World War, 'Welsh' were one of 15 clubs admitted to membership. The Southern Olympian League gradually extended its Membership and Reserve XIs were admitted for the first time in 1923-24 and a Minor Section in 1927–28. The status and reputation of the League was greatly enhanced in the seasons between the wars, but in 1939 the Second World War broke out and the League was again disbanded. Immediately hostilities ceased the League was restarted with 8 clubs. The number rapidly increased in succeeding seasons and in 1948-49 it was possible to form three Senior Divisions, Senior and Junior Challenge Cup competitions were introduced in 1948–49, Minor Cup in 1950-51 and a competition for 4th, 5th and 6th XIs in 1953–54. Honours London Welsh won the following league honours during their long period in the South Olympian leagues: > Senior Division 1 - London Welsh 1st XI in 1922-23 > Minor Division 3 - London Welsh 3rd XI in 1951-52 > Senior Division 3 - London Welsh 1st XI in 1953-54 > Senior Division 3 was won by London Welsh 1st XI in 1968-69 > Senior Division 3 was won by London Welsh 1st XI in 1973-74 > Minor Division E was won by London Welsh 3rd XI in 1979-80 > Senior Division 4 was won by London Welsh 1st XI in 1993-94 > Minor Division C was won by London Welsh 3rd XI in 1993-94 London Welsh also won the Middlesex Cup in 1921–22. In 2002 the SOL and the Old Boys’ Football League merged to form the Amateur Football Combination, one of Europe's biggest leagues. Of the original SOL clubs only London Welsh and Witan remain as members of the AFC. Up until the early 1990s Gunnersbury Park was Welsh's home until it they decided to seek better facilities and move to the Ibis ground nearby. London Welsh suffered from the selling off of sports pitches and for the next few years the club went through a nomadic period that included two seasons in south east London at Charlton. London have now come back to our West London roots and use the facilities of The Polytechnic Football Club from the Southern Amateur League. Present day club London Welsh currently operate two football teams, who play home games at the Quentin Hogg Memorial Ground in Chiswick and compete in the Amateur Football Combination. The Amateur Football Combination (AFC) is based in and around London and the Home Counties, and is believed to be the biggest adult football league in Europe. It has around 100 clubs and 350 sides playing Saturday afternoons, and comprises more than 1% of adult male 11-a-side football teams in England. In the 2016–17 season London Welsh's two teams competed in the South 1 and South 5 divisions. After a lean period the 'Welsh' picked up silverware in 2015–16, with the first XI winning the South Division 3 (And being promoted two divisions in a league re-organisation) and the second XI won the A.F.A. Cup. As well as competing for league honours teams are awarded marks for their sportsmanship, hospitality and facilities, and Welsh have been named the top club for hospitality three time since 2005. The club are a mixture of Londoners, Welshmen and International players, with the first X1 including several Ex-semi pro players. The club hold regular social events and have toured Cyprus, Cornwall, Bournemouth, Barcelona and Nice (For Euro'16) in recent years.

The station, owned by Evanov Radio Group, broadcasts a multilingual programming format. CHLO's studios are located on Dundas Street West in the Eatonville neighbourhood of Toronto, while its transmitter is located near Hornby. The station is one of only a few commercial radio stations in North America broadcasting on 530 kHz. History The station was launched in 1953 as 1090 AM CFJB, a daytimer owned by broadcaster Fen Job. Job was killed in a car crash in 1956, and the station was sold by his estate to CHIC Ltd. in 1959, adopting the new callsign CHIC the following year. As of 1960, Alekos Columbos hosted a 90-minute Greek radio show on Saturdays and Klaas Mulenar preached in Dutch on Sundays. In 1961, the owners also launched CHIC-FM on 102.1. In 1964, CHIC became a full-time broadcaster, moving to 790 AM. From 1966 to 1969, it operated as an \\"all-girl\\" format using the slogan \\"CHIC - Where The Girls Are\\" in which only female announcers appeared as deejays. Regular newscasts and some other features continued to be voiced by men. The format was abandoned in 1970. In 1977, CHIC-FM adopted the new callsign CFNY- FM. In 1979, the stations' owner went into receivership. The stations were subsequently acquired by Civitas Corp., the owner of CJMS in Montreal. Civitas became Mutual Communications in 1980, and CHIC adopted the new callsign CKMW. Mutual subsequently sold CKMW to Patrick Hurley, who incorporated as CKMW Radio Ltd., in 1983; CFNY was sold to Selkirk Communications. As CKMW, the AM station adopted its current multilingual format, and ownership of CKMW Radio was transferred to Evanov in 1985. The station adopted the new callsign CIAO in 1987, and moved to its current frequency in 1991 after CJFT in Fort Erie converted to the FM band.Decision CRTC 91-331 It retained the CIAO call sign until January 2019, when it adopted its current call sign.

The purple colouration was thought by some sceptical scientists to be due to the animal rubbing against a dye, but the animal does in fact secrete a purple pigment. The pigment is known to wash off in the rain and fade away after death, causing some possible confusion with other rock-wallaby species. The species has undergone taxonomic upheaval for decades and has variously been classified as an unadorned rock-wallaby, brush- tailed rock-wallaby, and black-flanked rock-wallaby.

Jancsó achieved international prominence from the mid-1960s onwards, with works including The Round-Up (Szegénylegények, 1965), The Red and the White (Csillagosok, katonák, 1967), and Red Psalm (Még kér a nép, 1971). Jancsó's films are characterized by visual stylization, elegantly choreographed shots, long takes, historical periods, rural settings, and a lack of psychoanalyzing. A frequent theme of his films is the abuse of power. His works are often allegorical commentaries on Hungary under Communism and the Soviet occupation, although some critics prefer to stress the universal dimensions of Jancsó's explorations. Towards the end of the 1960s and especially into the 1970s, Jancsó's work became increasingly stylized and overtly symbolic. Early life Miklós Jancsó was born to Hungarian Sandor Jancsó and Romanian Angela Poparada.Miklós Jancsó InterviewWakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1988. 465–472. After graduation he studied law in Pécs, receiving his degree in Kolozsvár (Cluj) in 1944. He also took courses in art history and ethnography, which he continued to study in Transylvania. After graduating, Jancsó served in World War II and was briefly a prisoner of war. He registered with the legal Bar but avoided a legal career. After the war, Jancsó enrolled in the Academy of Theatre and Film Arts in Budapest. He received his Diploma in Film Directing in 1950. Around this time Jancsó began working on newsreel footage and reported on such subjects as May Day celebrations, agricultural harvests and state visits from Soviet dignitaries. Career =1950s= Jancsó first started directing films in 1954 by making documentary newsreels. Between 1954 and 1958 he made newsreel shorts whose subjects ranged from a portrait of Hungarian writer Zsigmond Móricz in 1955 to the official Chinese state visit in 1957. Although these films do not reflect Jancsó's aesthetic development, they gave the director the opportunity to master the technical side of film-making while also enabling him to travel around Hungary and see firsthand what was happening there. In 1958, he completed his first full-length feature film, The Bells Have Gone to Rome, which starred Miklós Gábor. In the film a group of Hungarian schoolboys are pressured to join the army by Nazi Germans and fight against the Russians on the eastern front. As the schoolboys begin to learn about and understand the Nazi regime, they reject the Germans offer. Jancsó now dismisses this early work. Jancsó then returned to documentary film- making, including a collaboration with his wife Márta Mészáros. In 1959 he met Hungarian author Gyula Hernádi, who collaborated on Jancsó's films until his death in 2005. =1960s= After contributing to the film Három csillag with Zoltán Várkonyi and Károly Wiedermann in 1960, Jancsó's next feature film was Cantata (Oldás és kötés) in 1962. The film starred Zoltán Latinovits and Andor Ajtay, and was written by Jancsó from a short story by József Lengyel. In the film Latinovits plays a young doctor with humble roots who grows tired of his more intellectual life and career as a surgeon in Budapest. He decides to revisit his place of birth: his father's farm in the Hungarian plains and is affected by the connection to nature that he had forgotten in the city. He meets his former teacher, who reminds him of long forgotten childhood memories. In the end Latinovits learns to appreciate both his easy life in the city and the country life of his youth that made it all possible. The film received mixed reviews from film critics in Hungary, but won a prize from the Hungarian Critics Circle. Jancsó's next film was My Way Home (Így jöttem), released in 1964. It was his first collaboration with screenwriter Gyula Hernádi and starred András Kozák and Sergei Nikonenko. In the film Kozák plays Jozak, a teenaged deserter of Hungary's Nazi-run army at the end of World War II. He is twice captured by the Red Army, where he is put in charge of watching over a flock of sheep. There he befriends a young Russian soldier (Nikonenko), who is dying of a stomach wound. The two friends, who cannot communicate through language, begin to act like young boys and innocently play games together, forgetting their roles of captor and prisoner. The Russian soldier finally dies of his wound and Jozak again begins his journey home, wearing his dead friend's soviet army uniform to stay warm. While My Way Home had received modest international attention, his next feature in 1965, The Round-Up (Szegénylegények), was a huge hit domestically and internationally and is often considered a significant work of world cinema. The film was again written by Hernádi and starred János Görbe, Zoltán Latinovits, Tibor Molnár, Gábor Agárdy and András Kozák. The Round-Up takes place shortly after a failed Hungarian uprising against Austrian rule in 1848 and the attempts by the authorities to weed out those who took part in the rebellion. The film was shot in widescreen in black and white by regular Jancsó collaborator Tamás Somló. Although it is Jancsó most famous film, The Round-Up does not exhibit many of his trademark elements to the degree to which he would later develop them: thus, the takes are comparatively short and although the camera movements are carefully choreographed they do not exhibit the elaborate fluid style that would become distinctive in later films. The film does, though, use Jancsó's favorite setting, the Hungarian puszta (plain), shot in characteristically oppressive sunlight. The Round-Up premiered at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival and was a huge international success. Hungarian film critic Zoltán Fábri called it \\"perhaps the best Hungarian film ever made.\\" Film critic Derek Malcolm included The Round-Up in his list of the 100 greatest films ever made. In Hungary, the film was seen by over a million people (in a country with a population of 10 million). Jancsó's next work The Red and the White (Csillagosok, katonák, 1967) was a Hungarian-Soviet co- production to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the October 1917 revolution in Russia and the subsequent Hungarian Revolution of 1919. Jancsó set the action two years later during the Russian Civil War and, he made an anti-heroic film depicting the senselessness and brutality of armed combat. The film starred József Madaras, Tibor Molnár and András Kozák and was written by Jancsó. Along with The Confrontation, The Red and the White would have premiered at the 1968 Cannes Film Festival, but the festival was canceled due to the events of May 1968 in France. Internationally this film was Jancsó's biggest success, and received critical acclaim in Western Europe and the United States. It won the Best Foreign Film award from the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics. Along with Red Psalm (1971) it is featured in the book \\"1001 Films You Must See Before You Die\\". Jancsó then made Silence and Cry (Csend és kiáltás) in 1968. The film stars András Kozák as young revolutionary who goes into hiding in the country after the failed 1919 Hungarian Revolution. Kozák is hidden by a sympathetic farmer who is suspected by and constantly humiliated by the White Army. The farmer's wife is attracted to Kozák and begins to poison her husband. Kozák's morality compel him to turn the farmer's wife over to the White Army. This was the first film that Jancsó shot with cinematographer János Kende and was co-written by Gyula Hernádi and Jancsó. Also in 1968, Jancsó shot his first work in color, The Confrontation (Fényes szelek, 1969). It also was the first film to introduce song and dance as an essential part of the film, elements that would become increasingly important in his work of the 1970s and his recent Pepe and Kapa films. The film stars Andrea Drahota, Kati Kovács and Lajos Balázsovits. The film revolves around real events that took place when Hungary attempted to renovate its education system after the Communists came to power in 1947. In the film revolutionary students from one of the communist People's Colleges start a campaign to win over students from an older Catholic college. The campaign begins with songs and slogans, but eventually turns to violence and book burning. Jancsó ended the decade with Sirokkó (Winter Wind) in 1969. The film starred Jacques Charrier, Marina Vlady, Ewa Swann, József Madaras, István Bujtor, György Bánffy and Philippe March. Jancsó and Hernádi wrote the script in collaboration with Francis Girod and Jacques Rouffio. The film depicts a group of Croat anarchists in the 1930s who plot to assassinate King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. =1970s= In the late 1960s, Jancsó's films veered more towards symbolism, the takes became longer and the visual choreography became more elaborate. This found full fruition in the 1970s, when he took these elements to extremes. With regards shot-length, for example, Elektreia (Szerelmem, Elektra, 1974) consists of just 12 shots in a film lasting 70 minutes. This highly stylized approach (in contrast to the more realist approach of the 1960s) received widest acclaim with Red Psalm (Még kér a nép, 1971), which won Jancsó the Best Director award at Cannes in 1972. Like The Round-Up, Red Psalm focuses on a doomed uprising. In the latter part of the 1970s, Jancsó started work on the ambitious Vitam et sanguinem trilogy, but only the first two films, Hungarian Rhapsody (Magyar rapszódia, 1978) and Allegro Barbaro (1978) were made as critical reaction was muted. At the time, the films were the most expensive to have been produced in Hungary. During the 1970s, Jancsó divided his time between Italy and Hungary and made a number of films in Italy, the best known of which is Private Vices, Public Virtues (Vizi privati, pubbliche virtù, 1975), an interpretation of the Mayerling affair. His Italian films, though, have been critically derided. Unlike Jancsó's 1980s films, there has been no general critical reassessment of his Italian works and they remain the most obscure part of his filmography. =1980s= Jancsó's 1980s films were not successful and at the time some critics accused Jancsó of simply rehashing visual and thematic elements from his previous films. However, more recently these works have been re-evaluated and some critics consider this period to contain Jancsó's most important works.Jaromír Blažejovský in kinoeye The Tyrant's Heart (A zsarnok szíve, avagy Boccaccio Magyarországon, 1981) can be considered a transitional film between the famous historical works of the 1960s and '70s and Jancsó's later, more ironic and self-aware films. While it still has a historical setting (a 15th-century palace in Hungary), the film's ontological inquiry groups it more easily with the director's later period. The film deliberately undercuts the audience's ability to construct a notion of reality in the plot, which contradicts itself and includes many post-modern interventions to raise questions about its own manipulative nature. His 1985 film Dawn (A hajnal) was entered into the 36th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1987 he was a member of the jury at the 15th Moscow International Film Festival. Later in the decade, Jancsó dispensed with the historical rural settings of the Hungarian puszta and shifted to contemporary urban Budapest. Thus Season of Monsters (Szörnyek évadja, 1986) became the first Jancsó film with scenes in of contemporary Budapest since Cantata 23 years earlier. Although this film is set in a contemporary environment, very little of it is set in the city and much of it still on the puszta. While some new visual tropes were introduced (including a fascination with television screens that show clips of later or earlier action in the film), others, such as candles and naked women, were preserved. In later films of the decade Jancsó continued to use the surrealistic-parodistic style he developed in \\"Season\\". These films – at last – are set in an urban environment. Although some critics reacted positively (Season of Monsters, for example, won an honorable mention at Venice for creating \\"a new picture language\\"), critical reaction generally to these films was very harsh indeed, with some critics labeling them as self-parody. More recently, critics have been kinder to these dense and often deliberately obtuse films, with some considering his 1980s work to be his most compelling, but a full rehabilitation has been hindered by the fact that these works are very rarely screened. His 1989 film Jesus Christ's Horoscope was entered into the 16th Moscow International Film Festival. =1990s and 2000s= Miklós Jancsó at a press screening of his movie, So Much for Justice!, 1 February 2010, Budapest In the early 1990s, Jancsó made two films that thematically can be grouped with the works from the 1980s, God Walks Backwards (Isten hátrafelé megy, 1990) and Blue Danube Waltz (Kék Duna keringő, 1991). Although they continue the work of the previous decade, they are also reactions to the Hungary's new post-Communist reality and explore the inherent power struggles. After a long break from making full-length features, Jancsó returned with The Lord's Lantern in Budapest (Nekem lámpást adott kezembe az Úr Pesten, 1999), which proved to be a surprising come-back for the director. The film largely (but not entirely) dispenses with long takes and choreographed camera movements, and for this Jancsó started working with a new director-of- photography Ferenc Grunwalsky (who is also a director in his own right). The loose plot follows two gravediggers Pepe and Kapa as they try to make sense of the shifting realities of post-Communist Budapest. Despite mocking young Hungarians for their shallowness, the film proved a minor hit with them, helped by the performances by some of Hungary's top music acts in the film. In the late 1990s, Jancsó's career revived with a series of improvised low-budget films that were witty and self-deprecating. As well as doing relatively well at the Hungarian box office for art house fare, these films have been popular with a new generation of younger viewers. The success of The Lord's Lantern in Budapest has led to a succession of Pepe and Kapa films (six so far, the last in 2006 at the age of 85). Although all of these films are rooted in the present, recent ones have also seen Jancsó return to his earlier love of historical themes, including depictions of the Holocaust and Hungary's devastating defeat to the Ottomans in 1526, usually in the context of criticizing Hungarians for not understanding the meaning of their own history. These films are highly popular among young cinephiles, mainly for the post- modernist, contemporary approach to filmmaking, the black, absurd humor and the appearance of several popular alternative and/or underground bands and persons. Jancsó has also cemented his reputation by making appearances in a number of films. As well as appearing as himself in the Pepe and Kapa films, he has also had guest roles in works by young, up-and-coming Hungarian directors. In addition to feature films, Jancsó has made a number of shorts and documentaries throughout his career and from 1971 into the 1980s also directed work for the theater. Miklós Jancsó has been honorary scholar at the University of Theatre and Film Arts in Budapest since 1988, and was an affiliate at Harvard between 1990 and 1992. Politics During the Communist era Jancsó was often criticized for being formalist, nationalist and generally against the Socialist ideology. From the 1990s onwards Jancsó became known for loudly supporting Hungarian liberal party SZDSZ. Many of his claims, like his wry dismissal of Hungary and its history made him a somewhat controversial figure. He also campaigned for the legalization of cannabis. Personal life He married Katalin Wowesznyi in 1949; their two children are Nyika (Miklós Jancsó Jr., b.1952) and Babus (Katalin Jancsó, b.1955). After divorcing Wowesznyi, he married film director Márta Mészáros in 1958. In 1968 Jancsó met Italian journalist and script author Giovanna Gagliardo in Budapest. They moved to Rome, where he worked for nearly a decade, with occasional, short periods in Budapest. In 1980 he separated from Gagliardo and married film editor Zsuzsa Csákány in 1981. They had a son, Dávid, in 1982. Jancsó died of lung cancer on 31 January 2014, aged 92. Fellow Hungarian director Béla Tarr called Jancsó \\"the greatest Hungarian film director of all time.\\"Meghalt Jancsó Miklós Awards He received five nominations for the Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival. winning for Red Psalm in 1972. In 1973 he was awarded the prestigious Kossuth Prize in Hungary. He received awards for his life work in 1979 and 1990, at Cannes and Venice respectively.

At the bottom of the cover is a blank space for anyone not named on the cover to write their name. Each person who received the album got a copy with their name circled on the cover; this was done for identification of a \\"culprit\\" should the album ever end up for sale.

A year later, Shellac released their second commercial full-length, Terraform. Movements The music on The Futurist is divided into ten total movements. Versions have floated around on file-sharing communities which have divided the album into five movements, and into two sides (vinyl sides A and B—Shellac are notorious vinyl purists, and The Futurist was only issued on LP). Reception Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave the album a mixed review, citing its overtly experimental nature. \\"Rather than proper tracks or songs,\\" he writes, \\"the record seems to have ten \\"movements,\\" as each piece flows steadily into the next. Oscillator tweakings mixed with Morse code transmissions and overseas correspondence give way to brief guitar/bass/drum bursts. Skronking noise here, guitar twists there, and familiar band interplay every now and again à la \\"QRJ\\" (off 1000 Hurts) double dutch with each other, never outlasting their welcome.\\" He is, however, more favorable in viewing the second half and cites the \\"bombastic\\" final movement as \\"the high point of the record\\".

A public intellectual, she has devoted her career to writing and lecturing about the contributions of psychological science to the beliefs and practices that guide people's lives, and to criticizing \\"psychobabble,\\" \\"biobunk,\\" and pseudoscience. Her many writings have dealt with critical thinking, cognitive dissonance, anger, gender, and other topics in psychology. originally published in The Skeptic v7 n1 1999. Tavris received a B.A. in comparative literature and sociology from Brandeis University and a Ph.D. in social psychology from the University of Michigan. She has taught psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles and the New School for Social Research. She is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association, the Association for Psychological Science and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. Tavris is also a member of the editorial board of Psychological Science in the Public Interest. Her articles, book reviews, and op-eds have appeared in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, The Times Literary Supplement, Scientific American and other publications. In 2014 she began writing a column for Skeptic under the heading The Gadfly. Early life In an interview with The Skeptics Society, Carol Tavris describes her early life. She grew up in Los Angeles, California, with her parents, Sam and Dorothy Tavris, secular Jews who promoted and practiced critical thinking and equality for women. She was encouraged to argue and discuss everything with them, from household rules to religion. Her parents gave her books about successful women—ranging from Phillis Wheatley to Susan B. Anthony—and her father taught her poetry and storytelling. Her grandparents were Russian Jews who emigrated to Chicago in the early 1900s. Her mother, who earned a law degree at 21, became the sole breadwinner of the family in 1956 when Tavris’ father died suddenly. Tavris was 11 years old. Tavris majored in comparative literature and sociology at Brandeis University, graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. Brandeis faculty in her field were enamored with Freud during her college years, and her senior thesis was a \\"Freudian analysis of Hamlet and Don Quixote.\\" But her undergraduate infatuation with Freudian approaches did not survive her first year of graduate school. When Tavris went to the University of Michigan to get her Ph.D. in social psychology, she \\"fell in love with the process of science.\\" She loved learning about the \\"different methods of investigating questions, from field work and experiments to interviews and observations.\\" One reason she chose social psychology rather than comparative literature as her career was that she \\"liked the idea of testing ideas for their relative validity\\" and of being in a field whose research had immediate beneficial applications for people's private lives, relationships, and society. Career Why We Believe - Long After We Shouldn't CSICon 2016 Tavris took a year off from graduate school to write for a new magazine, Psychology Today. She returned to the magazine after receiving her Ph.D. and stayed for the next four years. She met Carole Wade, her future co-author, while writing for the publication; the two of them taught one of the first courses in women's studies at San Diego State University, and out of that teaching collaboration, they wrote The Longest War: Sex Differences in Perspective, an interdisciplinary approach to the age-old question of why gender inequality exists. In the 1980s, Tavris joined Carole Wade in writing an introductory psychology textbook, Psychology. It \\"was the first to explicitly and systematically integrate principles of critical thinking\\" into the introductory psychology course, along with mainstreaming research on gender and culture, with the goal of making the field more inclusive. Wade and Tavris also published Invitation to Psychology, a shorter version of their main textbook. As of 2015, Psychology is in its 11th edition and Invitation its 6th. Tavris's first major trade book, Anger: The Misunderstood Emotion (1982, revised 1989), brought social-psychological research to light on many of the pop-psych, Freudian-based ideas about anger that were and are prevalent but wrong: such as that it is healthier, physically and psychologically, to \\"ventilate\\" anger than to \\"suppress\\" it. On the contrary, she showed, repeated venting rehearses anger, raises blood pressure, and often makes the other person angry back at you. In ways typical of her lifelong approach, she brought skepticism, data, and critical thinking to her evaluation of this and many other beliefs about anger. In her chapter on anger in social movements, she took as her main examples the efforts to promote women's rights and civil rights, and the role of anger in igniting the pursuit of justice. =Cognitive Dissonance= A more recent area of focus for Tavris is cognitive dissonance, a theory first developed by Leon Festinger and later advanced by his student Elliot Aronson into a theory of self-justification. Cognitive dissonance is the state of discomfort one feels when two beliefs, or a belief and behavior, contradict each other, or, when a deeply held belief is disconfirmed by evidence. Written with the social psychologist Elliot Aronson, Tavris and Aronson's book, Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts, delves into the role cognitive dissonance has on people and how they see both the world and themselves. The book, first published in 2007, was updated and revised for a second edition in 2015. According to Tavris and Aronson, cognitive dissonance allows us to justify our mistakes and harms, keeping us from conscious awareness that we even made any, and thereby allows us to live with ourselves. This is how even \\"charlatans, scammers, and tyrants sleep at night.\\" Given a choice between accepting information that we don't want to hear and justifying outdated beliefs or hurtful acts, most people choose self-justification. Indeed, Tavris says, \\"the more we pride ourselves on our intelligence and our competence, the stronger our commitment to an ideology or philosophy of life,...the harder it is to accept evidence that we might be wrong.\\" Mistakes Were Made explains how cognitive dissonance applies in all domains of life, from decisions made during the Bush administration, prosecutors who cannot accept that they put innocent people in prison, to quarreling couples who cannot understand the other person's point of view. Tavris and Aronson use a pyramid metaphor to explain how self-justification can lead people far down a path they might never have imagined for themselves. Because of the need to reduce dissonance after we make a decision, once we have done so we become less able \\"to think skeptically and scientifically about it.\\" Our attitudes now change to be consistent with our behavior, and we may end up far away from people who took a different path. Tavris in office March 2017 =Gender, Feminism, and Women's Studies= Tavris began writing about women's status and gender differences in the 1970s. Her book with Carole Wade, The Longest War: Sex Differences in Perspective \\"[examines] the scientific evidence for and against many beliefs about women and women's lower status historically and cross-culturally.\\" In 1992, Tavris wrote The Mismeasure of Woman: Why Women Are Not the Better Sex, the Inferior Sex, or the Opposite Sex, a vigorous defense of equality feminism, the view that women are neither inferior to men nor superior to men, but are entitled to equality in all spheres. The title was an homage to Stephen Jay Gould's The Mismeasure of Man, because both books showed how societal prejudices can affect research—in his book, in the study of intelligence, and in hers, in the study of gender. Tavris' book draws on research in many disciplines to explode myths about \\"male and female\\" brains (a perennial issue), alleged gender differences in \\"natural\\" abilities, the social creation of \\"PMS\\", and other popular beliefs. In a final chapter, she examined and critically evaluated the emerging \\"recovered memory\\" epidemic in America, in which women were going into therapy and coming out believing they had been victims of sexual abuse for years, but had repressed the memory. In January, 1993, she wrote a controversial but influential lead essay for The New York Times Book Review, \\"Beware the Incest-Survivor Machine,\\" on the popular \\"sex-abuse-survivor\\" books, showing that their assumptions about memory, trauma, repression, and recovery were scientifically unwarranted. The Mismeasure of Woman received The Distinguished Media Contribution Award from the American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology and the Heritage Publications Award from the division of the Psychology of Women of the American Psychological Association. Tavris identifies as an equality feminist (in contrast to the strains of feminism that have promoted notions of female superiority or inherent differences in psychology and abilities). For Tavris, feminism and science are not incompatible: on the contrary, she regards the scientific method as a way to \\"further the goals of feminism, and feminism is a way of improving science.\\" Tavris has long believed that science and critical thinking are \\"the major tools we have for assessing which ideas are better than others, and of forcing ourselves to let go of ideas that don’t work.\\" In this goal, she maintains, skepticism - a willingness to question received wisdom, to demand good evidence, to be willing to hold even our own ideological beliefs up to scrutiny - is an essential ally. So, she would add, is a sense of humor. Personal life Carol Tavris was married to the actor Ronan O’Casey until his death in April 2012. As Ronan's son Matt wrote in an obituary, O’Casey \\"was a distinguished actor, producer and writer who enjoyed a picaresque life and career to the full. He was born in Montreal, Canada, to a poet father, Michael Casey, and actor mother, Margaret Sheehy, from Dublin, who had co-starred with the young James Joyce in his first stage role. Ronan began acting in his mother's company in Montreal at the age of eight and, following theatrical and vaudeville touring, moved to Dublin and then to London.\\" He met Carol in New York in 1975. Tavris, like her mother Dorothy, has been a lifelong member of the American Civil Liberties Union. She has testified as an expert witness in several court cases where evidence against a defendant was based on pseudoscientific, unvalidated psychological ideas, and she has been an advisor for the National Center for Reason and Justice, an advocacy group devoted to fighting false allegations and wrongful convictions. On August 21, 2010, Dr. Tavris was a special guest at the 10th Anniversary Gala by The Independent Investigations Group and received an award for contributions to skepticism and science. On May 10, 2013, she received an honorary doctorate of letters from Simmons College and on February 27, 2015, she received the Media Achievement Award from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. On July 27, 2016, she received the Bertrand Russell Distinguished Scholar award from the Foundation for Critical Thinking at Sonoma State.

Pureka identifies as genderqueer and cultivates an androgynous appearance. Pureka has received positive reviews in the long-running radical feminist publication off our backs and other magazines. Their music does not deal explicitly with LGBTQ or political issues, focusing instead on emotional interactions between individuals. They are a pescetarian.  Early life  Raised in Connecticut, they began writing songs at the age of eight and began playing the guitar at 16. They soon became a frequent performer at local coffee houses and open mics. As a young performer, they opened shows for such artists as Erin McKeown and Pamela Means while completing a degree in biology at Wesleyan University. After graduating, they worked in a microbiology research lab at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, eventually leaving to focus on music full-time.  Musical career  In June 2001, they recorded a self-titled seven-song EP in preparation for a three-month nationwide tour with lesbian folk poet Alix Olson. The EP, which was home-recorded in two weeks and featured Pureka playing back-up accompaniment on the mandolin and bass, was later mastered and reprinted for the 2005 summer tour. In 2004, Pureka released Driving North, their first full-length album, earning rave reviews from fans and fellow artists alike. In 2006, they released Dryland, and toured the US a second time as a headlining act. The album received rave reviews and was featured on the Paste Magazine Sampler in February 2007. In May 2007, Pureka was a member of the month-long New American Songwriter Tour in New York City, Philadelphia, and Massachusetts. The tour also featured Krystle Warren, Jesse Harris, and Ryan Scott. In August, they played at the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival. In July 2007, Pureka's song, \\"Swann Song\\" won 1st Place in the Acoustic competition on the independent music site ourstage.com. Because of their excellent performance there, they won a spot to perform at the Virgin Music Festival in Baltimore, Maryland, and performed there on August 5. Pureka had previously also won the Acoustic competition in April for her song \\"31 and Falling\\". In October 2007, they were nominated for 2007's Outstanding Folk Act by the Boston Music Awards. They were also awarded an ASCAPLUS award in the summer of 2007. Pureka sold over 7000 copies of their 2010 album, How I Learned to See in the Dark, independently, on their own label, Sad Rabbit Music, which they founded. During this time, they gained popularity by performing with artists such as Dar Williams, The Cowboy Junkies, Peter Mulvey, Ani Difranco, Martin Sexton, Jeffrey Foucault, Kris Delmhorst, Melissa Ferrick, Catie Curtis, and Girlyman. Pureka has been compared to artists like early Bruce Springsteen, Ryan Adams, Patty Griffin, Gillian Welch, and Mary Gauthier. She covered Welch's song \\"Everything Is Free\\" on Dryland and has expressed admiration for her music as well as that of Griffin. Pureka cites influences from Peter Mulvey and Pamela Means, as well as Ani DiFranco, but says that their own music differs greatly from DiFranco's often-outspoken political messages. She has lent vocals and guitar playing to several tracks by artists like Alix Olson and Arjuna Greist; a notable track is \\"Checking My Pulse\\" with Olson, which went on to become a relative hit for Olson. On January 20, 2009, Pureka released a fourth album, an EP entitled Chimera. The EP has seven tracks; one new, original song (with a prelude as the first track), a reworked studio version of a song off of their 2001 EP, three live tracks, and a cover of Bob Dylan and Ketch Secor's Wagon Wheel. The hard copy of Chimera is complete with written commentary from Pureka on each track. In April 2010, Pureka released their fifth album, How I Learned To See in the Dark, which they co-produced with Merrill Garbus.http://host.madison.com/entertainment/music/article_74967464-51fd-11df-86ba-001cc4c002e0.html In 2012 Pureka released a live album recorded at the Grey Eagle in Asheville, NC on January 19, 2011. It was recorded by Marsellus Fariss and mastered by Mark Alan Miller. Other musicians on the recording are: Andrea Alseri, Sebastian Renfield, Julia Read and Jax Keating. In 2016 Pureka released their first new music since 2013 with the album Back in the Ring. Personal life After their 2010 album release and a move to New York City, Pureka suffered from writer's block and emotional exhaustion. At the end of 2012, Pureka moved to Portland, Oregon.

It is an omnibus of both mainstream school subjects and uncommon subjects. It is designed to expose adolescents to as many forms of intellect, providing them a solid base of knowledge for further learning, and to present it in such a way that a child is not offended by its overly-scholarly nature. Renaissance Method Taking directly from Piaget's model of cognitive development, which brings to light the underestimated logical ability of a child, and the Montessori method, which understands that children are simply not \\"small adults\\" but humans that have their own way of learning and understanding, the Renaissance Method presents introductions to all subjects, but allows the adolescent to choose his favorite, or the one he is most comfortable in. Through this liberty, a child may pick up on the fundamental subjects subconsciously, without having to be drilled. For example, instead of teaching an adolescent directly about multiplicative inverses of numbers, one could instead show her the merits of the golden mean and how it is often seen in nature and architecture. After a certain interest be developed, one would explain the mathematical elements behind the golden mean. Or instead of teaching a child the basic elements of a story as the beginning, middle, and end (which can often be ambiguous and confusing, and differ from story to story), one might begin with the simple three-act story structure and, in time, proceed to the four-act story structure. Cultural Persuasion Borrowing from Highlights for Children and other children's magazines, Academy Earth attempts to instill ethics into young readers, not by direct means, but by featuring stories that exhibit moral values. Academy Earth also tries to instill an interest in culture, featuring historical articles, and tolerance of the world's peoples. The vast curriculum encourages a child to take an interest in many subjects.

A student of German composer Josef Rheinberger, he became the first director of the Opera Sector of the National Theatre in Belgrade in 1889 and began working with the Belgrade Military Orchestra a decade later. He composed the first Serbian opera, At Dawn (), in 1903. In 1911, Binički established the second Serbian Music School. He joined the Serbian Army following the outbreak of World War I and composed one of his most famous works, March on the Drina, following the Serbian victory at the Battle of Cer. He retired as head of the Opera Sector of the National Theatre in 1920 and died in Belgrade in 1942. He is considered one of the leading Serbian composers of the Generation of the 1870s. Life and career Stanislav Binički was born on 27 July 1872 in the village of Jasika, near Kruševac, Principality of Serbia. He studied in Belgrade and Munich with German composer Josef Rheinberger. Binički became the first director of the Opera Sector of the National Theatre in Belgrade in 1889. In 1899, he began collaborating with the Belgrade Military Orchestra. He enriched the orchestra's musical repertoire with pieces such as Franz Schubert's 8th Symphony, Richard Wagner's overture to Rienzi, Antonín Dvořák's Slavonic Dances, and Felix Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony. The first Serbian opera, At Dawn (), was written by Binički and premiered in 1903. Music critics John Warrack and Ewan West describe the opera as a pioneering work and praise Binički's ingenious use of contrasting musical styles to depict the struggle between Serbs and Turks. thumb In 1911, Binički established the second Serbian Music School from within the Singing Society Stanković. He went on to conduct the first Serbian performances of Ludwig van Beethoven's 9th Symphony and Joseph Haydn's Creation. He composed a piece titled Memorial Service in 1912. Binički's instrumental and stage music generally mixed Serbian, Middle Eastern and European—mostly Italian—elements. His choral works are mostly representative of Serbian folk music. Encouraged by Binički, the National Theatre performed operas such as Il trovatore, Djamileh, Der Freischütz, Werther and Mignon during the 1913–14 operatic season. The National Theatre's work was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I in the summer of 1914. Binički joined the Serbian Army after war was declared. He composed what became known as March on the Drina shortly after the Battle of Cer to commemorate the Serbian victory. He dedicated it to his favourite commander in the army, Colonel Stojanović, who was killed in the fighting. His piece was initially titled March to Victory. Some scholars have hypothesized that Binički based his work on an Ottoman Turkish military march. In 1915, Serbia was invaded by Austria-Hungary, Germany and Bulgaria. The Serbian lines quickly collapsed and the Serbian Army was forced to retreat through Albania. The Belgrade Military Orchestra subsequently lost all of its instruments and its entire music archive. Binički survived the retreat and managed to reach the Greek island Corfu, where he collected new instruments, reconstructed his scores and arranged a concert in the Corfu National Theatre. He and other Serbian musicians toured France in 1917, beginning with three concerts held in Paris. After the war, Binički returned to the Balkans and took part in a six- month tour through the towns of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He retired as head of the Opera Sector of the National Theatre in 1920 and was succeeded by Stevan Hristić. He died in Belgrade on 15 February 1942. Legacy Binički is considered one of the leading Serbian composers of the Generation of the 1870s. March on the Drina is one of his best known works. The song experienced widespread popularity during and after World War I and became one of the most famous Serbian nationalist songs.

The World Productions in association with multiple international companies. Originally produced as a short movie titled Molly Star Racer, a television series was developed in cooperation with Jetix Europe, with animation production by HAL Film Maker and Pumpkin 3D, a large portion of which was done in Tokyo, Japan. It aired in more than 100 countries including Japan. In the US, the series aired on ABC Family and Jetix/Toon Disney between June and December 2006. A potential sequel or spinoff is currently in development.http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2017-03-02/oban-star- racers-anime-sequel-spinoff-seriously-considered/.112871 Synopsis In the year 2082, Earth has been invited to compete in the Great Race of Ōban, an intergalactic race whose winner can be given \\"The Ultimate Prize\\", supposedly granting any wish in the world - even bringing back a loved one. The invitation comes from the Avatar, a mysterious entity who ends hostilities between Earth and the sinister race of the Crogs, in return for Earth's entry into the race. Eva Wei, an Earth student, escapes boarding school to find her father, Don Wei, president of Wei Racing and the best race manager in the world. Having left his daughter in the care of the boarding school for many years without ever visiting, Don Wei does not seem to recognize Eva as his daughter. Unable to tell her father who she really is, she lands a job as a mechanic in his team under the name \\"Molly\\", a name chosen from a convenient poster on a crate in the hangar. When Wei Racing is ordered by the government to represent Earth at Ōban, Molly stows away as they are taken to a far-off planet. During the first race, the Whizzing Arrow, the Earth Star-Racer ship, crashes due to sabotage. Its star pilot, Rick Thunderbolt, becomes unable to race. After finding that the gunner, Jordan Wilde, makes a miserable pilot, Molly steals the ship and enters the next race. Don Wei grudgingly decides that the only one who can replace Rick is Molly. Haunted by the death of her mother - a famous star-racer - and the harsh \\"reunion\\" with her father, Molly is determined to win so she can be with her parents once again. Characters =Main characters= ; :Voiced by: Chiara Zanni (English), Junko Noda (Japanese), Gabrielle Jeru (French) :Eva is an ambitious 15-year-old Earth girl who often subverts her school studies to improve her mechanical skills. Upon escaping from her harsh boarding school, she travels to find her father, Don Wei. But when he doesn't recognize her she ends up landing a job as a mechanic for his company. Lacking in self-confidence and intimidated by his harsh demeanor, Eva is unable to tell Don Wei who she really is, and assumes the name \\"Molly\\" after reading it on a conveniently placed poster. Eva soon becomes the lead pilot for the Earth Team after their star, Rick Thunderbolt, is injured during the first race. Since she is too short to pilot the Whizzing Arrow herself, she modifies the controls to be based on her scooter, which she is an expert at handling. Molly soon meets the other contenders of the Great Race Of Ōban and develops a (mutual) attraction to Prince Aikka of Nurasia. Her life soon becomes more complicated when she learns that the reward for winning Ōban is any wish her heart desires, including bringing her dead mother back to life. ; :Voiced by: Sam Vincent (English), Keiichirou Satomi (Japanese), Thomas Guitard (French) :Jordan is a 17-year-old rambunctious army soldier who is hired by Don Wei to be the gunner for his racing vehicle. He is a good shot, although he tends to overdo it. Jordan is very protective of his racing partners. As seen throughout the series, Jordan has an intense hatred of the Crogs because his grandfather was attacked by Crogs on an exploring mission (Seen in episode 1). He doesn't approve of Eva's interest in Prince Aikka, as the Nourasians have an alliance with the Crogs. While he acts more like an overprotective brother toward Eva while they are on Alwas, on Ōban he starts to develop more serious feelings for her (though it is unclear if Molly feels the same way about him). Jordan helps Eva fight their way to the Temple of the Heart to stop Canaletto from regaining his Avatar powers. Just when Canaletto is about to capture the sphere containing the Avatar's powers, Jordan tells Molly he loves her and jumps into the sphere, therefore becoming the new Avatar. He and Molly have a brief conversation right after he becomes the new Avatar, in which he tells her goodbye and kisses her. He is last seen on Oban, watching the team leave for Earth (though they don't see him), with a single tear escaping from his eye. ; :Voiced by: Ron Halder (English), Unshou Ishizuka (Japanese), Jérôme Keen (French) :Don is Eva's father and owner of Wei Racing, a successful Earth corporation that manufactures vehicles and sponsors races. Uptight and arrogant with an openly hostile view towards female pilots, he often hides his true feelings through formalities, as well as pride. When his daughter finds him, not only does he not recognize her—he even mistakes her for a boy at first. The death of his wife and the following separation from his daughter shaped him into the uptight man he seems to be. Due to several events while on Ōban, he finally discovers that Molly is his daughter. Afterwards, he becomes very concerned for Molly's safety due to the increasing danger of the grand finals—even attempting to withdraw the team from the competition to prevent her from racing. Near the end of the series, he reveals to her that he knows she's his daughter, and doesn't want what happened to his wife to happen to her. Although yelled at by Molly, he continues to watch over her without the others knowing about their relationship. Finally before Eva leaves to crown herself Avatar, Don confronts her by her real name in front of the team and tells her he loves her. At the end of the series, he returned to Earth to live with Eva as a family again. ; :Voiced by: Nicole Oliver (English), Tomoko Kobashi (Japanese), Sarah Bouché de Vitray (French) :Maya is Eva's mother and Don's wife, one of the best racers on Earth who lost her life in a race ten years before the start of the series. Her sudden death appears to be the reason for Don Wei's current behavior. It originally appeared that Spirit, one of the pilots racing on Alwas, caused her to crash, which was later shown to be false - the crash was caused by Maya's ship leaking fuel from the engine causing it to explode. Eva is determined to win the Great Race of Ōban in order to bring Maya back to life and reunite her family. However, Eva later learns the truth about the \\"Ultimate Prize\\" and that the Avatar's power would not bring back her mother. Later, she discovers that her mother was actually \\"killed\\"; it was Canaletto who caused the crash. After returning to Earth, she and her father pay their final respects at Maya's grave. ; :Voiced by: Michael Dobson (English), Jun'ichi Suwabe (Japanese), Alexandre Coadour (French) :Rick is a Minor League Racing Champion and one of the best racers on Earth, and is chosen to accompany Don Wei as the Earth Team's original pilot. He is seriously injured in the team's first race, and is later told that he can never race again, a fact that he learns to slowly accept, since racing was \\"his whole life\\". Cool and confident, he seems to appreciate Molly's enthusiasm, and affectionately calls her \\"Little Mouse\\". He seems to be the first to see her potential as a pilot, playfully asking Don Wei if he took her along as a backup pilot in the second episode. Eventually, Rick becomes Molly's personal coach and begins to discover that Molly is hiding a secret from the team. During the race against Spirit, he finally determines Molly's true identity but doesn't reveal it to anyone else. After the team qualifies for the Grand Finals on Ōban, Rick returns to Earth, but only after he encourages Molly to tell Don she's his daughter and try to work things out. ; :Voiced by: Alessandro Juliani (English), Yoshinori Fujita (Japanese), Vincent Latorre (French) :Koji is the Earth Team's co-mechanic and electronics specialist. Originally working at Miguel's Garage, he is hired by Don Wei as part of the Earth Team. Shy and non-combative by nature, he prefers to avoid conflicts, but his quick thinking has saved the Earth Team on many occasions. It was his idea for the 'clustered turbine' hyperdrive that allows the team's new racer, the Whizzing Arrow III, to be much faster than their previous racers. They affectionately call the Arrow III their \\"baby\\". After returning to Earth, he goes back to work for Miguel. ; :Voiced by: Dexter Bell (English), Keisuke Fujii (Japanese), Nicolas Mead (French) :Stan is the Earth Team's co-mechanic and hardware specialist. Originally working at Miguel's Garage, he is hired by Don Wei as part of the Earth Team. The polar opposite of his fellow mechanic Koji, Stan is very direct and combative, and doesn't hesitate to speak his mind, especially when the safety of a teammate is at stake. Stan feels that Don Wei is putting too much pressure on Molly to win on Ōban, and that Don is too prideful and concerned with his own feelings to consider the feelings of the rest of the team. This is seen the most when the team reaches Oban, as they are usually the spectators of the drama the team faces and are seen having brief conversations about Don Wei's behavior. A recurring theme is Stan telling Koji that Don Wei is heartless and a robot - an idea Koji usually rejects. After returning to Earth, he goes back to work for Miguel. ; :Voiced by: Kirby Morrow (English), Hiroaki Miura (Japanese), Rémi Caillebot (French) :Prince Aikka is the Prince and Knight of Nourasia who races on the back of a giant flying beetle named G'dar, which acts as his vehicle. Noble, chivalrous and skilled in martial arts, he is a rival of Molly's, but also a close friend—since Molly finds him cute and the attraction seems to be mutual. Molly and Aikka promise each other that during their race they would not use weapons against each other (episode 8), but near the end Molly is unable to prevent Jordan from firing. Aikka feels betrayed and gains a distrust of humans. It is later shown, however, that Aikka still cares for Molly and would even come to her defense if he felt she was threatened, such as in her race against Spirit (when she crashes and Spirit seems to want to harm her further, Aikka leaps from the spectator stands and flies to her on G'dar, ready to shoot at Spirit if he tried to hurt her). Aikka is one of the nine Ōban finalists, and appears to have forgiven Molly's \\"betrayal,\\" but still holds a grudge against Jordan. Once on Ōban, Aikka is pressured by General Kross to cut ties with the Earth Team and eliminate them, as the Crogs have invaded his world and hold his family hostage. He finally succumbs and disables the Arrow III during a race in the mountains. Although he begins to drift from the Earth Team and lose their trust, he later abandons a race and goes looking for Molly after the Arrow III crashes. During the final race, he confronts Molly and Jordan and apologizes, and suggests they defeat Kross together. At the end of the series, he promises to show Molly his kingdom one day after he liberates it from the Crogs. ; :Voiced by: Brian Drummond (English), Masashi Hirose (Japanese), Nicolas Mead (French) :Saris is a small, eccentric being who proclaims himself to be the Avatar's loyal servant. He mysteriously appears whenever Molly needs some encouragement, or when things aren't going her way. He also has a second persona, Super Racer, and competes against her in the playoffs on Alwas. Satis becomes even more mysterious, when on Ōban, another grand finalist pilot reveals that he was on all three preliminary planets at the same time. Just prior to the final race, it is revealed that Satis is not the Avatar's servant, but the Avatar himself. Satis was the previous winner of the Great Race 10,000 years ago. It is also revealed that as the finish of the race approaches his power and health have begun to weaken. After Molly refuses to accept the powers of the Avatar, Satis destroys the Pyramid of Power in the temple to prevent Canaletto from stealing the powers. Canaletto defeats him, and Satis is last seen in the hands of Aikka, disappearing into a cloud of lights. ; :Voiced by: Colin Murdock (English) :Canaletto is the main antagonist of the series. Also known as \\"The Timeless One\\". A dark, sinister being that first appears as a shadow with flaming red eyes and a raven head. It is shown that he once went on a crusade to destroy all life and create universal purification, thinking that life is a weakness, a mistake made by the Creators. Canaletto was the Avatar before Satis, but he refused to give up the title and so was imprisoned by the Great Beings. Feeling that he was wrongfully removed from his rightful throne, he intends to become the Avatar once again. Rick discovers a crest with his insignia, since he knew it was linked to the crash of his teams' star racer that left him unable to race again. He eventually tracks down Canaletto with the help of a shaman, but after his encounter, Canaletto erases all of his memories related to himself and all of the information he told him. Molly then finds the crest when Rick leaves it behind. Canaletto has been using Molly as his pawn for some time, killing her mother to give her motivation to participate in the Great Race, destroying the Whizzing Arrow I and injuring Rick so that she has to race in his place. He does all this because he knows she is the only racer that, if she won, would not want to be crowned as the Avatar, giving him the time to escape from the chains Satis put him in 10,000 years ago and reclaim his power. ; :Voiced by: Paul Dobson (English), Banjou Ginga (Japanese), Mathieu Barbier (French) :The Avatar is enigmatic, omnipresent, and seemingly omnipotent entity who organizes the \\"Great Race of Ōban\\" every 10,000 years, and grants the winner their wish, or so the competitors were led to believe. In \\"Revelations\\", the origins of Ōban are revealed. The planet is the first creation of almighty beings known as the Creators, who then went on to create the rest of the universe. However, they chose to give up their immortality, and so organized the great race of Ōban every 10,000 years, the winner of which would prove themselves as the strongest, fastest and most fit to be leader. The winner would not get one wish from the Ultimate Prize—they would instead become the new Avatar, the new guardian of the Creators' creation, until the next race. =Alwas Cycle characters= ; :Voiced by: Brian Dobson (English), Jin Horikawa (Japanese), Omar Yami (French) :A biomechanical racer who, along with his ship, seems to run on steam power. Violent and quick to anger, he does not suffer losing gracefully. After losing to the Earth Team, he seeks out Molly and starts a fight, intending to kill her. Though Jordan comes to help, it is Prince Aikka who defeats him (to save Molly). His sleek, Podracer-style craft is described as a \\"piece of junk\\", but is very resistant to damage, thanks to its polarised titanium exterior. It's also heavily armed, with a pair of missile launchers/projectile cannons on the fronts of the engines and a rapid-fire laser gun mounted on the cockpit. Groor speaks about himself in third person, and has an odd tendency to shout his own name in battle. ; :Voiced by: Michael Dobson (English), Hitoshi Horikawa (Japanese), Laurent Maurel (French) :A pilot from Alwas, the host planet of the Great Race's preliminary matches. Somewhat arrogant and not quite as good as he seems; the judges fix the races for him, since he's the hometown favorite. He and his gunner, Marcel, pilot the Flying Fortress, a green star-racer that resembles a steam-powered train or tugboat. The two of them later confront Stan and Koji, who are looking for spare parts, and show them the location of a star-racer \\"graveyard\\". Flint reasons that if he can help the Earth Team reach Ōban, then he will have lost to the best team in the galaxy and that this would \\"restore\\" him in the eyes of his fans. ; :The last surviving member of the Mong, a very ancient race. He resembles a hieroglyphic carving come to life, and his ship is a bizarre tangle of pipes that apparently functions via an unknown form of planetary magnetism. He could use this force to reflect enemy attacks back at them and also used a flute to create hallucinations. He could also use his staff to tap on the hollow pipes of his ship, creating destructive sound waves to use against enemies. Ceres was able to trap Molly within a hallucination during their race, until Rick was able to turn on her CD player, the loud rock music caused the illusion to shatter and Ceres to lose concentration and ultimately crash into a wall on the race track. He survived though, somehow, and is briefly glimpsed in Make Way!, waiting in line to return to his homeworld. ; :Voiced by: Jocelyn Loewen (English), Yuri Shiratori (Japanese), Johanna Menuteau (French) :A catlike, 12-year-old hacker prodigy; trickery and sabotage are her main strategies, but she won't hesitate to blast an opponent off the course either. She controls her ship via a dynamic footpad, which resembles a Dance Dance Revolution platform. She sees the Great Race as nothing more than a game. It was Para-dice that reveals the 'true nature' of the Ultimate Prize to Molly during their race. She is a pink catlike creature with a cube-shaped head and a lime green and purple jumpsuit- style outfit. Though she speaks fluent English, she has the odd tendency to say \\"meow\\" frequently between sentences. She is seen again, briefly, in Make Way! when Eva runs to the docks looking for Rick. ;Super Racer :A racer dressed as a superhero who turns out to be Satis in disguise, testing the other racers. He acts very cocky and usually makes eccentric poses. His ship is unique, it resembles an upright ring, with the cockpit on the top and a mouth with shark teeth painted on it. Two large metal balls come out of the center of the ring and rapidly orbit around the ship to prevent enemies from overtaking him. It has three short metal legs on the bottom that are used for a trotting/jumping start until the ship gains enough momentum to fly. There are also light laser cannons mounted on the nose. ; :Voiced by: Richard Newman (English), Kenji Nomura (Japanese) :A giant racer resembling a Viking who, despite his intimidating appearance, is a very friendly, good-natured person. His first appearance was in Hostilities Break Out when Molly nearly gets run over by his star-racer on her way to get fuel. He saves Molly from drowning after she becomes trapped inside flooding ruins. When asked why he was following them, he tells Molly and Jordan that he came to congratulate them on beating him in the race earlier that day. Apparently, on his planet the people are known for being optimistic and looking on the bright side of things. He then says his ram horn was half-full. Rush abandoned the race to duel Toros after it was revealed to him that he was the Crog who led the invasion of his home world Byrus. He lost both the duel and the race when Toros drove his ship into a bridge over the race course, burying him in a pile of rubble and knocking him out of the playoffs. Rush had wanted to use the Ultimate Prize to undo the damage that the Crogs had done to his home world. Rush's star-racer is made of a unique metal from his homeworld that is nigh-unbreakable. However, it is also faster than it looks, thanks to its powerful magma-fueled engines. Rush sits atop his racer, controlling it and its two extendable arms with a pair of circular control yokes. ; :Ambassador of the Fills; a mysterious, polymorphic, shadowy being. Ten years earlier he raced against Molly’s mother, Maya. Near the end of the race Maya’s ship crashed and exploded. Molly and her father since that day have believed that Spirit had intentionally killed Maya. During a race against Molly that ended in Molly crashing her ship trying to kill Spirit, Spirit showed an unconscious Molly what really happened to her mother; Spirit noticed Maya's vehicle was leaking and wanted to stop the race, but Maya pushed him to keep going indicating to him everything was okay before the explosion took place. Spirit then left to finish the race, but not before shedding a tear implying he felt guilty for the death of Maya. He is eliminated at the end of the playoffs by Prince Aikka. He utilises his polymorphic shapeshifting powers to transform into a birdlike creature that can easily match any star-racer's speed. ; :Voiced by: Brian Drummond (English), Banjō Ginga (Japanese), Mathieu Barbier (French) :Colonel of the Crog Imperium and younger brother of the Crog leader. The Crogs are the sinister alien race that threatened to destroy Earth 25 years ago. He is determined to obtain the Ultimate Prize in order to enslave the entire galaxy under Crog rule. Toros was also the leader of the Crog force that decimated Rush's homeworld of Byrus, transforming it from a paradise into a polluted wasteland. Seemingly unbeatable, he is finally handed a defeat during his rematch against Molly when he crashes against the starting gate in a game of \\"chicken\\", but still advances to the Grand Finals. During the course of the Alwas playoffs, his first racer, a standard Crog Trident, was damaged during his race with Rush. It was replaced just before his rematch with Molly with an upgraded model, sporting more curvaceous and intimidating blades and a two-stage Hyper Drive similar to the Earth Team's Whizzing Arrow III. Despite having the best record on Alwas, Toros' single '\\"unacceptable'\\" loss to the Earth Team results in him being replaced as the Crog's pilot on Oban by General Kross. Kross states that he \\"Gave his head willingly to the Crog Imperium\\", hinting that Toros may have been executed by his own request, unable to bear that he lost to the Earth Team. =Ōban Cycle characters= ; :Voiced by: Keiji Fujiwara (Japanese) :A 'magician' known across the galaxy with telekinetic superpowers that are rumored to equal those of the Avatar himself. Sul shows little emotion and rarely reacts to the other pilots unless attacked. He does not actually use a star-racer during the competition, instead he surrounds himself with glowing, diamond-shaped energy fields conjured and controlled by his mind. He states that he desires the Ultimate Prize because as the \\"master of space, time, and even the course of destiny\\", there is nothing else for him to wish for. He dominates the first four races on Oban before being eliminated by Canaletto as his ability to alter destiny threatened to ruin his carefully laid plans. It is possible that he still survived; Canaletto wasn't strong enough to kill him, instead arranging for the powerful being to be drawn through an inter-dimensional portal, where he possibly continued to exist. ; :Voiced by: Jillian Michaels and Colleen Wheeler (English), Ai Orikasa and Tomoko Hiratsuji (Japanese) :Two very proud and aggressive creatures from the destroyed planet Inna; their race is made up of females only. Their star-racer is distinctive in that it is actually two ships that fly in tandem, but are capable of combining to form a more powerful craft. After combining their ships, they gain the ability to use an extremely powerful heat-seeking plasma cannon. Their star-racers are rectangle-shaped, red with a black border and, when it is two separate racers, are driven like motorcycles. The short-haired sister, Skun, can make her fingernails grow into very long claws. She is also extremely strong, tearing a hole in the Arrow III's hull with her bare hands in the episode Nervous Like Ning & Skun. They want the ultimate prize to reunite their people, who are scattered throughout the galaxy. In the episode \\"Canaletto's revenge\\" the sisters challenge Kross for the last gate. Although it is never seen, the battle is witnessed from afar by Molly, and the fact Kross emerges victorious, emphasizes their demise. This proves to be false when in the final episode both are shown to have survived. Though Ning and Skun are known to be fierce, they also have a deep bond of loyalty to each other, as shown when deciding to compete to be the next Avatar, they didn't want to be separated. And when they were about to ambush Kross, told each other they had no regrets and that \\"whatever happens, I'm glad it was with you\\". In the Oban Star Racer artbook it's said that Ning and Skun are close like lovers. ; :Voiced by: Don Brown (English), Tetsuo Gotō (Japanese) :Captain of a space galleon, as bad-tempered as he is egocentric. He is easily recognizable due to him being the smallest in stature of all the racers, as well as his habit of keeping his very large tongue hanging outside his mouth, having at first the appearance of a scarf or ascot. Being a self- proclaimed pirate, he only sees the Ultimate Prize as a treasure to be claimed. After the race is over, his crew members return to where they came from and are assumed to continue their careers as pirates, but Furter himself is conspicuously absent. His star-racer is a large, slow, pirate ship-shaped vehicle armed with 4 cannons, capable of firing either energized cannon balls or tow cables. It also carries a pair of powerful (if rather slow-firing) guns hidden in its masts. Furter's crew can usually be seen running about the deck, going about their duties and panicking when shot at. The vessel was destroyed by Kross in the episode \\"Canaletto's Revenge\\" when he rammed his star-racer into it, splitting it in two before it exploded; all the crew escaped, but Lord Furter tried to prove his loyalty to his ship by not abandoning it, though at the last moment he has a change of heart and flees just as his ship explodes. ; :Voiced by: Brian Dobson (English), Shōzō Iizuka (Japanese) :General of the Crog Imperium. He replaces Toros as the Crog's representative on Ōban, because Toros' loss to the Earth Team in the last race of the playoffs was \\"unacceptable\\". Even more intimidating than Toros, Kross has a distinctive crescent-shaped scar over his left eye and has four ears compared to Toros' two. Kross pilots a much stronger version of the Crog Trident, the starfighter used by Toros on Alwas; his is equipped with more cutting blades, and a fixed bow weapons pod that fire sicklelike laser bolts, a large laser sword, and can fire heat-seeking energy torpedoes. After revealing the true nature of the Ultimate Prize to the Crog Senate, they make him their Supreme Ruler. Kross stalks and attempts to eliminate all the pilots during the last race of the competition. In the end, it comes down to a sprint between him and Molly. Kross attempts to land on top of Molly and cut her racer in two, but a last-second maneuver by Molly sends Kross's fighter plowing into the ground. Kross' last words are a surprised curse of \\"By Kramm\\" as his fighter crashes and explodes with him in it. ; :Voiced by: Trevor Devall (English), Hideo Watanabe (Japanese) :Ondai is a robot that looks like a cylinder that walks on three flat metal legs. Very analytical and constantly running calculations, but is also known to have a sarcastic and narcissistic personality. Ondai's star-racer is capable of transforming into a humanoid mech armed with a pair of energy swords and a battery of missile launchers. He may sometimes get carried away with calculations when too many things around him are mathematically possible, causing him to go into a state of awe, as was exemplified in Optimized Like Ondai. His constant putting-down of living creatures would make one think that he would wish for machines to reign supreme, but this could not be further from the truth; he actually envies organic beings. As a robot, he cannot feel the sensations of touch or warmth, which he longs for. Constant study of living creatures has done nothing, so he hopes that the Ultimate Prize will do that which science cannot; make him flesh and blood, or at least let him feel. His star-racer (in robot mode) was disabled by Prince Aikka in the final race, and he is not seen again. ; :The tallest of the nine Oban pilots, he resembles a large upside down teardrop with stubby legs and one large eye in the middle. He appears to \\"pilot\\" a large, bizarre, organic construct that looks similar to a jellyfish of some sort. In 'Ominous Like O', Kross fired a laser at him, and he absorbed the shot and fired it back in a giant wave which damaged the Arrow III causing it to crash at the bottom of the seemingly bottomless canyon. O is also able to transform into a larger, bulkier humanoid form with arms that somewhat resemble the heads of killer whales. In \\"Canaletto's Revenge\\", it is revealed that O was present when Satis first locked Canaletto away - Satis begs O for his help to destroy Canaletto, as alone he could only neutralize his powers. However, O left instead, with Satis calling after him \\"O, don't leave, come back!\\" Thinking back to this during the last race, a guilt-ridden O chooses to settle in a crater rather than attempt to finish. After Canaletto is freed, O rushes to help Molly, Jordan and Prince Aikka and follows them to the Temple of the Heart, where he protects them from two giant guardians controlled by Canaletto before being killed by them. His unique energy absorption abilities allowed him to take the guardians down with him, consuming them in an enormous explosion that disintegrated all three of them. ; :A large crustacean alien with a heavy, armored shell and large pincers, as well as telepathic tentacles. Molly and Jordan initially mistook it for a native Ōban life form. Prince Aikka comments that it's not normally aggressive unless provoked. Muir flies in what appears to be a giant, flying horseshoe crab, with claws and tentacles similar to its own, and a strange retractable fin in the back that discharges energy spheres. In Monstrous Like Muir, Molly discovers that she isn't the only one who wants to bring back a loved one; Muir's mate was killed by alien hunters who wanted her tentacles and left her for dead and it hopes to win the Great Race to bring her back to life. While racing, Muir sits atop a large, liquid-filled globe, containing the body of its mate. It is also revealed that the tentacles on Muir's back allow it to communicate telepathically and appear to be highly prized as a hunting trophy. Muir chooses not to take part in the final race after learning the Avatar doesn't have the power to resurrect his mate. After the race ended he returned to his home planet. Earth Team Star-Racers Whizzing Arrow I: Prototype racer built at Miguel's Garage by Miguel, Stan, and Koji. Purchased by Don Wei for the Great Race. It has very powerful engines but is unsteady and untested. Rick Thunderbolt pilots the Arrow I in the Earth Team's first race on Alwas. Near the end of the race, the port engine explodes causing the racer to crash in a flaming wreck across the finish line. The Arrow I cannot be salvaged. Whizzing Arrow II: Sister ship to the Whizzing Arrow I. Purchased by Don Wei for the Great Race. Subtle advances over the Arrow I make the ship more stable. The Arrow II also boasts an orange and red flaming paint job, along with the addition of a sharp-toothed rabbit that Molly painted on in 'Surprising Like SuperRacer', compared with the Arrow I's flat green color. The Arrow II serves as the Earth Team' primary racer during the preliminaries and most of the semi-finals on Alwas. It suffers severe damage throughout the competition numerous times but is constantly repaired by Stan and Koji. During the semifinal race against the Fill Ambassador, Spirit, the Arrow II is damaged beyond repair when a crash literally tears it to pieces. Whizzing Arrow III: New racer built on Alwas by Stan and Koji with the help of native Skrub mechanics to replace the lost Arrow II. The Arrow III is far more advanced than both the Arrow I and Arrow II but maintains the same overall shape of the previous racers. Major upgrades include it being safer, more stable and a good deal faster than the Arrow II while in cruising mode. Also, a new Hyperdrive is developed by Stan and Koji back on Earth but not implemented until after the Arrow II's crash which uses 'clustered turbines' for a far greater thrust that allows the Arrow III to far exceed the Arrow II in speed. The new Hyperdrive is physically very different from its predecessor too, forming numerous turbines and wings all around it. A larger fuel supply also allows the Hyperdrive to be used for longer periods of time. In addition to the much greater Hyperdrive, mechanics Stan and Koji also added in the \\"Booster Drives\\", a grouping of five extra turbines that extend from underneath either side of the star racer's main engine blocks, proving to be a massive boost to the racer's speed. In the series, these drives add a much needed edge to some of the more punishing races. Development Dissatisfied with his previous experiences as a screenwriter in the animation industry, Savin Yeatman-Eiffel wanted to create a distinctive kind of show, one that would revive the type of emotions he had felt as a kid watching the classic Japanese anime series of the 70's. To put it short, he wanted to stress the emotional side of his characters and story, something that he felt had totally disappeared from Western animation productions.Oban Art book Working on that idea, he created his own company \\"Sav! The World Productions\\", which released in 2001 a short movie entitled \\"Molly, Star Racer\\", produced in part by Sparx Animation Studios and set to a Y&Co.; remix of Ayumi Hamasaki songs. The trailer already showed a mix of 3D and 2D though at the time 3D was still predominant. It featured many of the characters with unfinalized designs including Jordan, Don Wei, Maya, Aikka, Satis, Toros, Sül, Ondai, Ning & Skun, Furter and of course, Molly racing across various places in the Oban landscape featured later in the series. This short movie won the 2001 LEAF Awards and was nominated for best editing in the 2002 Imagina Awards.http://www.savtheworld.com/eng/company.php4 STW company background summary Leaked on the internet, it quickly became extremely popular among animation fans, generating hundreds of thousands of downloads on various sites - a rarity at the time. In spite of the success of the trailer, the search for financing for the series was a long process since Yeatman-Eiffel had a clear vision of where he wanted to take the show - more realistic and more emotional than the original trailer - and refused to negotiate with a party that would have tried to bend or change the artistic choices at a later stage (including, as was offered to him by an important North American production company to change the main character into a boy).http://www.newtype- usa.com/blog/index.php?itemid=311 NewType USA Interview with Yeatman-Eiffel Savin was also dead set on producing the series in Tokyo in collaboration with Japanese animators. This was the best choice according to him technically and a logical one too in view of the inspirations that had fuelled the creation of the series. Savin Yeatman-Eiffel succeeded in the end, involving major financial partners like Disney and Bandai without surrendering his control of the artistic elements. But it took him a total of nine years to complete the series from initial idea to delivery of the final episode (the concept was created in 1997, with initial production having begun in Paris is 2000, later moving to Tokyo in 2003). While this is Sav! The World's first TV series, the company has previously existed as a maker of various short films (including the aforementioned Molly, Star Racer). The English voices were recorded by Airwaves Sound Design in Vancouver, Canada. The voice director for the series is Michael Donovan.ショーナンロケッティアズ STAND ALONE BLOGLLESIV Music The opening and ending theme songs of Ōban Star-Racers were composed by Yoko Kanno (of Macross Plus, Escaflowne and Cowboy Bebop fame), and the musical score is composed by Taku Iwasaki. The series has one official soundtrack only available through the official site which include extended versions of \\"Chance to Shine\\" and other songs. In the US broadcast, the opening theme song was replaced by an original rock oriented theme song entitled \\"Never Say Never\\", which was also used for international broadcasts outside of Europe when Disney XD launched in February 2009.

MAN / Volkswagen joint venture 1977–93 Volkswagen's first joint venture into trucks outside of their own LT range was with MAN Nutzfahrzeuge (Commercial Vehicles) from 1977–1993. Truck production started in 1979 and ended in 1993 with 72,000 units produced. It was available with four engines and four wheelbases over its lifetime; there was also a 4X4 version called 8.150 FAE. FAE means \\"forward control\\" cab, all-wheel drive, single tyres so the F nomenclature means \\"forward control\\" cab. This series is usually referred to as the G90, from the most common model, but also as the \\"G\\"-series. In the United Kingdom it was originally marketed as the \\"MAN MT\\" series. The original lineup in the UK consisted of the 6.90 and the 8.90 (the first digit denoting the GVW in tonnes, the second for power in metric horsepower) and the 8.136 and 9.136. MAN AG supplied engines which were available in inline-four and inline-six cylinder engine configurations, with DIN rated motive power outputs of:  * MAN AG replaced the G series (as it was known internally) with the L2000 and M2000 ranges. VWCV and MAN shared the project development in accordance with the collaboration agreement as follows: Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles took care of: *the tilting driver's cab including steering wheel and fixing, hand levers and foot pedals the VW LT Mk 1 cabin was used for the MAN-VW range, the cabins are wider than the standard LT cabins so they can fit the truck chassis *the complete interior equipment and heating *the manual gearbox with clutch and gear lever, the rear axle with rear-axle transmission and suspension *the cardan shafts including bearings *the electrical system for the entire concept, and the platforms for the standard design MAN was responsible for: *the engine including cooling, exhaust, inlet and fuel system *the front axle with suspension and steering *the frame with all parts for attaching the springs and axles, the steering, the batteries, the power braking system and fuel system *the brakes, i.e. for the complete wheel brakes front and rear, the dual-circuit power brakes and parking brake *the wheels and tyres *the platform for special designs and tipping mechanism MAN-VWCVs were built in Volkswagen's Hanover factory until other Volkswagen models took priority; they were then made at MAN AG's Salzgitter-Watenstedt factory. MAN-VWCV range 6.90, 8.90, 6.100, 8.136, 8.100, 8.150, 9.136, 9.150 and 10.136. \\"F\\" and \\"FAE\\" are sometimes on the end of some of these model numbers.

One of them was a small postal van which was built at the request of the German Postal Services. By 1964 the Type 147 or Kleinlieferwagen was in production. In popular culture it has also been christened the nickname of Fridolin. From 1975–1979, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles produced for developing countries a small air-cooled FWD truck called the Volkswagen EA489 Basistransporter, with a rudimentary chassis and basic metal sheeting. It was easily manufactured from semi knocked down kits into a light truck. In 1989 Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles partnered with Japanese firm Toyota to build the Toyota Hilux pick-up truck rebadged as a Volkswagen Taro. This partnership was to help Toyota build sales in Europe and give VW a vehicle in the 1 tonne pick-up segment. The venture was not a huge success and it split in the late 1990s.Volkswagens of the World by Simon Glen pages 151 and 152 Image:DSC02522.JPG1947 Plattenwagen File:VW_Caddy_Kasten_1.6_TDI_Facelift.JPGCaddy (Typ 2K) 2005—present File:0385_Porsche_Diesel_Bus_blau.jpgT1 Transporter / Microbus 1950-1967 File:Ambulanzwagen_Portugal_VW-Bus_T2.jpgT2 Transporter / Microbus 1967—1979 File:Vw_t3_caravelle_carat.jpgT3 Transporter / Caravelle / Vanagon 1979—1990 File:2006-08_Bundespolizei_VW_Transporter.JPGT4 Transporter / Caravelle / Eurovan 1990—2003 File:VW_Multivan_2.0_TDI_Edition_25_(T5,_Facelift)_%E2%80%93_Frontansicht,_20._Mai_2012,_Velbert.jpgT5 Transporter / Caravelle / Multivan 2003—2015 File:VW California Europe 2.0 TDI (T5, Facelift) – Frontansicht (1), 30.

It is a congenital disorder in which the fetal development of the lower spine—the caudal partition of the spine—is abnormal. It occurs at a rate of approximately one per 25,000 live births. Some babies are born with very small differences compared to typical development, and others have significant changes. Most grow up to be otherwise normal adults who have difficulty with walking and incontinence. Signs and symptoms This condition exists in a variety of forms, ranging from partial absence of the tail bone regions of the spine to absence of the lower vertebrae, pelvis and parts of the thoracic and/or lumbar areas of the spine. In some cases where only a small part of the spine is absent, there may be no outward sign of the condition. In cases where more substantial areas of the spine are absent, there may be fused, webbed or smaller lower extremities and paralysis. Bowel and bladder control is usually affected. Cause Antero-posterior radiographic view, showing missing ribs, absent lumbosacral vertebrae, hypoplastic pelvis and \\"frog-like\\" position of the lower extremities in a fetus with caudal regression syndrome The condition arises from some factor or set of factors present during approximately the 3rd week to 7th week of fetal development. Formation of the sacrum/lower back and corresponding nervous system is usually nearing completion by the 4th week of development. Due to abnormal gastrulation, the mesoderm migration is disturbed. This disturbance results in symptoms varying from minor lesions of the lower vertebrae to more severe symptoms such as complete fusion of the lower limbs. While the exact cause is unknown, it has been speculated that the condition has a combination of environmental and genetic causes, and that various types of the condition may have differing causes. Sacral agenesis syndrome (agenesis of the lumbar spine, sacrum, and coccyx, and hypoplasia of the lower extremities) is a well- established congenital anomaly associated with maternal diabetes mellitus (not gestational diabetes). However, other causes are presumably involved, as demonstrated by the rare incidence of caudal regression syndrome (1:60,000) compared to diabetes. The dominant inherited sacral agenesis (also referred to as Currarino syndrome) is very often correlated with a mutation in the Hb9 (also called HlxB9) gene (shown by Sally Ann Lynch, 1995, Nature Genetics). It was previously thought to be related to sirenomelia (\\"Mermaid syndrome\\") but has now been determined not to be related to this condition.(reference https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/sirenomelia/) Prognosis There are four levels (or \\"types\\") of malformation. The least severe indicates partial deformation (unilateral) of the sacrum. The second level indicates a bilateral (uniform) deformation. The most severe types involve a total absence of the sacrum. Depending on the type of sacral agenesis, bowel or urinary bladder deficiencies may be present. A permanent colostomy may be necessary in the case of imperforate anus. Incontinence may also require some type of continence control system (e.g., self-catheterization) be utilized. The condition often impacts the formation of the knees, legs or feet that is sometimes addressed through surgery. For some with tightly webbed, bent knees or knees that are fused straight, disarticulation surgery at the knee may be a viable option to maximize mobility options. Before more comprehensive medical treatment was available, full amputation of the legs at the hip was often performed. More recently, the 'amputation' (actually a disarticulation because no cutting of the bone is involved) is done at the knee for those who have bent knee positions and webbing between thigh and calf to enable more ease of mobility and better seating. Some children with knee disarticulation use prosthetic legs to walk. Prosthetics for children without substantial hip and trunk control is usually abandoned in favor of faster and easier wheelchair mobility as the child's weight and age increases. Children may 'walk' on their hands and generally are able to climb and move about to accomplish whatever they need and want to accomplish. Children more mildly affected may have normal gait and no need for assistive devices for walking. Others may walk with bracing or crutches. There is typically no cognitive impairment associated with this disability. Adults with this disability live independently, attend college, and have careers in various fields. In 2012, Spencer West, a man with sacral agenesis and both legs amputated, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro using only his hands.

Biography  Born in Georgia, then part of the Russian Empire, he graduated from the 3rd Alexander’s School (1887) and the General Staff Academy in St Petersburg (1894). The next ten years were spent in military work in various regions of the empire. He took part in the Russo- Japanese war (1904–1905) in the capacity of a chief of staff of the 6th Eastern Siberian Division. He served, from 9 November 1911 to 9 January 1914, a governor general of Samarkand and was moved afterwards as a chief of staff of the Turkestan Military District. Promoted to lieutenant general on 11 October 1914, he was Chief of Staff of the 10th, and later of the 1st Army. In 1917 he held command over the 15th Army Corps, 1st and 3rd armies. On October 2, 1917 he was appointed the commander-in-chief of the Caucasus Army. In January 1918 he was in command at Erzurum. During the total collapse of the Tsarist administration he tried to prevent the imperial army's disintegration, then resigned as a commander and helped to organize national Georgian divisions. In March 1918, he served as deputy minister of war for the Transcaucasian Transcaucasian Commissariat, but was sacked for his nationalistic sentiments. After Georgia’s declaration of independence (May 26, 1918), he held various important posts in the national armed forces and served as the commander-in-chief of army from the fall of 1920 to February 1921. After the Soviet invasion of Georgia, his fate becomes unclear. According to some sources, he was shot by the Bolsheviks in 1921. He, however, appears to have fled to Turkey, where he died around 1924. Odishelidze's son Alexander, a colonel of the Georgian army, moved to France, where he died in 1933.

Edelman was one of the founders and president of the board of the New Israel Fund. Early life and education Edelman grew up in a Jewish family in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Hyman and Miriam Edelman. His father worked as a lawyer and his mother worked as a homemaker. His grandfather Eliezer Edelman was a rabbi in Poland; Eliezer and his wife were shot and killed by the Nazis during World War II. Edelman received his A.B. in 1958 from Harvard College and LL.B. degree from Harvard Law School. He served as a law clerk to Judge Henry Friendly on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and then as a law clerk for United States Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg. Career Edelman worked in the United States Department of Justice as special assistant to assistant attorney general John W. Douglas. Edelman worked as a legislative assistant to Senator Robert F. Kennedy, from 1964 to 1968, accompanying Kennedy to his meeting with labor leader Cesar Chavez.

In late 1994, Clinton considered nominating Edelman to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that had become vacant with the decision by Abner Mikva to retire from the bench on September 19, 1994, to become White House counsel. However, Clinton feared a difficult confirmation battle, later successfully nominating Merrick Garland to the seat. In 1995, Clinton mulled nominating Edelman to the federal district court in Washington D.C., but in August 1995, abandoned that possibility as well.Neil A.

The word owarai is the honorific form of the word warai, meaning \\"a laugh\\" or \\"a smile\\". Owarai is most common on Japanese variety shows and the comedians are referred to as owarai geinin or owarai tarento. Presently Japan is considered to be in an \\"owarai boom\\", and many minor talents have been finding sudden fame after a gag or skit became popular. Characteristics Manzai (), a traditional form of Japanese comedy that became the basis of many modern acts today, is characterized by a pair of usually older male comedians acting certain roles in a constant comedic battle against themselves. This tradition is continued in the acts of many modern talents. While there are many women talents, they are largely outnumbered by the men, and they tend to take more minor roles. Whereas manzai performers traditionally wore kimono (traditional Japanese dress), these days a western suit is the outfit of choice for many owarai kombi (, combination; referring to a pair of comedians in a unit) and many talents who begin their careers performing in a style very similar to stand-up comedy, usually including aspects of manzai and conte. Some minor characteristics include frequently used sound effects (cheap, old-fashioned sound effects are used intentionally for comic effect), dajare (, a Japanese-style pun), and dokkiri (, a hidden- camera prank like those seen in the popular American show Candid Camera). Owarai geinin On television, most owarai geinin are introduced using their kombi name (e.g. Yoiko Hamaguchi) and some geinin even retain the name of their former groups after they have parted ways. A few popular kombi include: * Tunnels * Downtown * Ninety-nine * Bakushō Mondai * Gokuraku Tombo * Cocorico * Kyaeen * Audrey * Untouchable * Impulse * Othello, a rare female kombi * Cream Stew * Summers * Neptune * Jichō Kachō * Sandwichman * Speed Wagon * TIM * Tutorial * Penalty * Yoiko * Rahmens * Regular Many owarai units have names based on English words or phrases. Kombi are usually included as guests for shows, though some (namely Downtown, Cream Stew, and Ninety-nine) often act as hosts as well. Some popular talents that usually don't perform in units are: * Ken Shimura * Sanma Akashiya * Tamori * Beat Takeshi * Cha Katō * Shinsuke Shimada * Tetsurō Degawa * Egashira 2:50 * George Tokoro * Teruyoshi Uchimura * Daimaou Kosaka * Koriki Chōshū * Hiroshi * Tsutomu Sekine * Takashi Fujii * Michiko Shimizu * Hori * Sayaka Aoki, another rare female act * Tomonori Jinnai * Chihara Junior Of these, Sanma, Tamori, and Beat Takeshi are sometimes referred to collectively as the \\"big three\\" because of their massive popularity. Talents such as these often act as hosts for shows, or perform together in small or large groups, something almost unimaginable for most western comedians. Variety shows Japanese variety shows are the main outlet for most owarai geinin and along with drama and anime they are some of the most popular shows on Japanese television. As a general term in Japan, \\"variety show\\" can refer to \\"straight\\" variety shows with an appropriate myriad of topics, segments, and games. It is also used for comedy oriented shows that focus more on stand-up and skits, and quiz/trivia type shows featuring comic elements. It is not to be expected that a variety show will always follow the same format, and guests from Japanese music and talent pools are frequent. The variety style shows generally divided into segments of games, features, and \\"corners\\", some very short and some shows focusing (for a special episode) solely on one game or feature. Trivia, quiz, or game shows in Japan are often considered owarai as the contestants of such shows are often a mix of owarai geinin and other Japanese talents of various descriptions. Game shows without any famous characters playing the role of contestants are rare. Of these sections and games, many can be seen recurring on a variety of shows all across Japan. It may even be possible to classify Japanese variety shows (or at least the individual sections of the shows) according to the following formats: *Quizzes or trivia (with subjects as varied as (zatsugaku, general or useless knowledge), math, science, history and other school subjects, kanji (testing peoples' knowledge of difficult or rare characters), English, and a mishmash of typical quiz-style trick questions *Food judgement/tasting/making (various types of food are also commonly used as prizes for the winner of a game) *Travel (often travelling within Japan to view someones estate or around the world producing short, documentary-style segments about world culture, with a comic twist) *Physical challenges, tests of strength/endurance etc. *Tests of improvised comic skill (for example, a dajare contest) *Obstacle courses/collections of strange games or activities *Music (Either with real Japanese musicians, or with owarai geinin trying their hands at music (often karaoke style), covering popular songs or showing off their own) Some concepts of variety shows are consistent over most of Japanese television, though they may be considered quite different from those seen in the western world. Many shows are made up of what are called VTRs, or video segments, and are usually introduced with a hand gesture and the word dōzo (the implied meaning is \\"let's have a look\\"), though this procedure is usually made into a joke with strange gestures instead of the usual wave. A few popular variety/comedy shows of varying contents are: * King of Comedy (showcasing the stand-up acts and skits of new and popular talent, often featuring VTR segments of the activities of various talents) * The God of Entertainment (similar to King of Comedy, though focusing on stand-up acts) * The Tunnels' Thanks to Everyone (the origin of the international Brain Wall television franchise, hosted by duo Tunnels) * Apron of Love (talents lacking cooking skill are asked to cook difficult dishes and are given harsh, though honest, judgements) * SMAP×SMAP (the five members of the immensely popular group SMAP host many different shows, presenting segments such as music, cooking, and news) * Zenigata Kintarō (this show's segment bimbō batoru (battle of the poor) showcases the life of two or more people living in Japan who support interesting life styles on minimum amounts of money; the funniest, or most inspiring bimbō wins) * Matthew's Best Hit TV+ (hosted by the comedian Takashi Fujii, this show features musical guests and a strange variety of games and unrelated segments) * Spring of Trivia (showcasing interesting and strange facts (or strange interpretations of boring facts) of little or no importance using a trivia- style format) * Nep-league (featuring the owarai trio Neptune on one of the two teams of contestants, this quiz show features various \\"levels\\" of play challenging the players' knowledge of everything from world events to reading Japanese to spelling simple English words) * Ken Shimura no Baka Tono-sama (hosted by comedian Ken Shimura) See also * List of Japanese comedians * Manzai * Glossary of owarai terms * Nininbaori  Further reading    External links * 大笑い.com (oowarai.com)—Japanese site promoting owarai and owarai talents * お笑い芸人相関図 (owarai geinin sōkanzu)—Japanese site with information on various owarai geinin and the relationships they have with other talents * お笑い芸人図鑑 (owarai geinin zukan)—Japanese site, so-called encyclopedia of owarai geinin Category:Performing arts in Japan Category:Television in Japan Category:Japanese comedy ","title":"Owarai"},{"id":"3917813","text":"Basic diagram of the atomic nuclear model: electrons in green and nucleus in red 3D animation of an atom incorporating the Rutherford model The Rutherford model was devised by the New Zealand-born physicist Ernest Rutherford to describe an atom. Rutherford directed the Geiger–Marsden experiment in 1909, which suggested, upon Rutherford's 1911 analysis, that J. J. Thomson's plum pudding model of the atom was incorrect. Rutherford's new model for the atom, based on the experimental results, contained new features of a relatively high central charge concentrated into a very small volume in comparison to the rest of the atom and with this central volume also containing the bulk of the atomic mass of the atom. This region would be known as the \\"nucleus\\" of the atom.  Experimental basis for the model  Rutherford overturned Thomson's model in 1911 with his well-known gold foil experiment in which he demonstrated that the atom has a tiny and heavy nucleus. Rutherford designed an experiment to use the alpha particles emitted by a radioactive element as probes to the unseen world of atomic structure. If Thomson was correct, the beam would go straight through the gold foil. Most of the beams went through the foil, but a few were deflected. Rutherford presented his own physical model for subatomic structure, as an interpretation for the unexpected experimental results. In it, the atom is made up of a central charge (this is the modern atomic nucleus, though Rutherford did not use the term \\"nucleus\\" in his paper) surrounded by a cloud of (presumably) orbiting electrons. In this May 1911 paper, Rutherford only committed himself to a small central region of very high positive or negative charge in the atom. > For concreteness, consider the passage of a high speed α particle through an > atom having a positive central charge N e, and surrounded by a compensating > charge of N electrons.E. Rutherford, \\"The Scattering of α and β Particles by > Matter and the Structure of the Atom\\", Philosophical Magazine. Series 6, > vol. 21. May 1911 From purely energetic considerations of how far particles of known speed would be able to penetrate toward a central charge of 100 e, Rutherford was able to calculate that the radius of his gold central charge would need to be less (how much less could not be told) than 3.4 × 10−14 metres. This was in a gold atom known to be 10−10 metres or so in radius—a very surprising finding, as it implied a strong central charge less than 1/3000th of the diameter of the atom. The Rutherford model served to concentrate a great deal of the atom's charge and mass to a very small core, but didn't attribute any structure to the remaining electrons and remaining atomic mass. It did mention the atomic model of Hantaro Nagaoka, in which the electrons are arranged in one or more rings, with the specific metaphorical structure of the stable rings of Saturn. The plum pudding model of J. J. Thomson also had rings of orbiting electrons. Jean Baptiste Perrin claimed in his Nobel lecture1926 Lecture for Nobel Prize in Physics that he was the first one to suggest the model in his paper dated 1901. The Rutherford paper suggested that the central charge of an atom might be \\"proportional\\" to its atomic mass in hydrogen mass units u (roughly 1/2 of it, in Rutherford's model). For gold, this mass number is 197 (not then known to great accuracy) and was therefore modelled by Rutherford to be possibly 196 u. However, Rutherford did not attempt to make the direct connection of central charge to atomic number, since gold's \\"atomic number\\" (at that time merely its place number in the periodic table) was 79, and Rutherford had modelled the charge to be about +100 units (he had actually suggested 98 units of positive charge, to make half of 196). Thus, Rutherford did not formally suggest the two numbers (periodic table place, 79, and nuclear charge, 98 or 100) might be exactly the same. A month after Rutherford's paper appeared, the proposal regarding the exact identity of atomic number and nuclear charge was made by Antonius van den Broek, and later confirmed experimentally within two years, by Henry Moseley. These are the key indicators- * The atom's electron cloud does not influence alpha particle scattering. * Much of an atom's positive charge is concentrated in a relatively tiny volume at the center of the atom, known today as the nucleus. The magnitude of this charge is proportional to (up to a charge number that can be approximately half of) the atom's atomic mass—the remaining mass is now known to be mostly attributed to neutrons. This concentrated central mass and charge is responsible for deflecting both alpha and beta particles. * The mass of heavy atoms such as gold is mostly concentrated in the central charge region, since calculations show it is not deflected or moved by the high speed alpha particles, which have very high momentum in comparison to electrons, but not with regard to a heavy atom as a whole. * The atom itself is about 100,000 (105) times the diameter of the nucleus. This could be related to putting a grain of sand in the middle of a football field.  Contribution to modern science  After Rutherford's discovery, scientists started to realise that the atom is not ultimately a single particle, but is made up of far smaller subatomic particles. Subsequent research determined the exact atomic structure which led to Rutherford's gold foil experiment. Scientists eventually discovered that atoms have a positively charged nucleus (with an exact atomic number of charges) in the center, with a radius of about 1.2 × 10−15 meters × [atomic mass number]. Electrons were found to be even smaller. Later, scientists found the expected number of electrons (the same as the atomic number) in an atom by using X-rays. When an X-ray passes through an atom, some of it is scattered, while the rest passes through the atom. Since the X-ray loses its intensity primarily due to scattering at electrons, by noting the rate of decrease in X-ray intensity, the number of electrons contained in an atom can be accurately estimated.  Symbolism  Shield of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Rutherford's model deferred to the idea of many electrons in rings, per Nagaoka. However, once Niels Bohr modified this view into a picture of just a few planet-like electrons for light atoms, the Rutherford–Bohr model caught the imagination of the public. It has since continually been used as a symbol for atoms and even for \\"atomic\\" energy (even though this is more properly considered nuclear energy). Examples of its use over the past century include but are not limited to: * The logo of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, which was in part responsible for its later usage in relation to nuclear fission technology in particular. * The flag of the International Atomic Energy Agency is a Rutherford atom, enclosed in olive branches. * The US minor league baseball Albuquerque Isotopes' logo is a Rutherford atom, with the electron orbits forming an A. * A similar symbol, the atomic whirl, was chosen as the symbol for the American Atheists, and has come to be used as a symbol of atheism in general. * The Unicode Miscellaneous Symbols code point U+269B (⚛) uses a Rutherford atom. * The television show The Big Bang Theory uses a Rutherford atom as its logo. * On maps, it is generally used to indicate a nuclear power installation.

The route is owned and maintained by the National Park Service and is considered part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Route description The Gatlinburg Bypass begins at an intersection with U.S. 441 (Newfound Gap Road) within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park southwest of Gatlinburg. It travels generally northward for about half of its route before turning to the northeast and ending at an interchange with U.S. 321/441 (Great Smoky Mountains Parkway) just north of town. After splitting with U.S. 441, the bypass almost immediately crosses over the West Prong of the Little Pigeon River. The road then begins to climb in elevation as it traverses Cove Mountain overlooking Gatlinburg from the west. It crosses over (but does not intersect) Ski Mountain Road, before winding its way over to its only mid- route intersection at Campbell Lead Road, which is accessed via a short two- way access road. After the intersection, the parkway begins to descend the mountain and again crosses the West Prong of the Little Pigeon River, before ending at a second interchange with U.S. 321/441. Northbound traffic leaving the bypass can go either direction on \\"Parkway\\" (as Great Smoky Mountains Parkway is called locally for brevity): continuing north along the river (the Foothills Parkway \\"spur\\" to Pigeon Forge, also maintained by the NPS), or south into downtown Gatlinburg. Conversely, due to very limited space for an overpass and two lanes of heavy traffic that would have to be crossed without one, traffic from the north end of town cannot access the bypass to go southbound to avoid the almost constant congestion through downtown. At the south end, southbound traffic on either road can reverse direction to return north on the other.

It was adapted from the 2000 stage play, Yi (\\"You\\") about Yeonsangun of Joseon, a Joseon dynasty king and a court clown who mocks him. It was released on 29 December 2005, runs for 119 minutes; and distributed domestically by Cinema Service and internationally by CJ Entertainment. The movie is referred to by various titles. It is sometimes known as The King's Man (the literal English translation of the Korean title). In Chinese, the title is \\"王的男人\\" or \\"王和小丑\\", and in Japanese, it is known as \\"王の男\\". It is also known as The Royal Jester in English, as the movie's English translator found it more fitting than the original title. The film was chosen as South Korea's official submission for the 2006 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. With over 12.3 million tickets sold, it was the most watched movie of South Korea of the year, as well the tenth highest-grossing film in South Korea. Plot  Set in the late 15th century during the reign of King Yeonsan, two male street clowns and tightrope walkers, Jangsaeng (Kam Woo-sung) and Gong-gil (Lee Joon- gi), are part of an entertainer troupe. The effeminate and beautiful Gong-gil specializes in female roles ; their manager prostitutes him to rich customers, and Jangsaeng is sickened by this practice. After Gong-gil kills the manager in defense of Jangsaeng, the pair flee to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers. Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the royal court, including the king and his new concubine Jang Nok-su. Though they make a lot of money from the performance, they are eventually arrested for treason and flogged severely. Jangsaeng makes a deal with Choseon, one of the king's consultants, either to make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jangsaeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them all a part of his court. When the king wants to see more performances, the clowns decide to make flyers asking for other minstrels to audition to join the group. The other clowns notice that Jangsaeng and Gong- gil have identical handwriting, as Jangsaeng learned to write by watching Gong-gil. The corruption within the court is revealed when the clowns put on a performance ridiculing the council members by implying that they receive expensive gifts for favours. The king is delighted by the skit, but upon seeing that the council members are not amused, turns on them and asks them one by one if they are guilty of what the clowns are mocking them for. He banishes a corrupt minister and orders that his fingers be cut off and displayed to all the other council members as a warning. Over time, the king falls for Gong-gil, whom he calls to his private chambers often to perform finger puppet shows. Jangsaeng becomes jealous of this relationship and suggests that they leave, but Gong-gil does not immediately agree. Meanwhile, the king becomes more and more unstable. He makes the clowns perform a skit depicting how his mother (played by Gong-gil), the favorite concubine of the former king, was forced to take poison after being betrayed by other jealous concubines. The king then slaughters these concubines at the end of the play, and the Queen Mother dies from shock. Jangsaeng then asks Gong-gil to leave with him and the gang once more before the king kills them too during one of his homicidal fits. Gong-gil, who initially sympathized with the king, begs the tyrant to give him his freedom but the king refuses. The king's main concubine, Jang Noksu, becomes increasingly enraged by the attention the king has been lavishing on Gong-gil. The council members try to have him killed during a hunting trip, resulting in the death of one of the members of the street performing team. Days after the hunting trip, the king forcibly kisses Gong-gil and his violence against the members of his own court escalates, especially at the mention of his father who he feels still rules over the kingdom even after his death. This leads the performing troupe to finally decide to leave the palace, because the king has become too unpredictable, but Gong-gil begs Jangsaeng not to leave him alone as he is not allowed to leave the palace. Then, Jang Noksu tries to have Gong-gil jailed by having flyers run in Gong-gil's handwriting insulting the king severely. Jangsaeng takes the blame for the crime for which Gong-gil has been falsely accused, as their handwriting is the same, and is set to be beheaded the next morning. Choseon secretly releases Jangsaeng, however, telling him that he should forget Gong- gil and leave the palace. But Jangsaeng ignores the advice and returns to walk on his tightrope across palace rooftops, this time openly and loudly mocking the king. The king shoots arrows at him while Gong-gil tries in vain to stop him. Jangsaeng falls and is caught, and has his eyes seared with burning iron as punishment before being thrown into prison again. Gong-gil attempts suicide, but his life is saved by the palace doctors : the king then loses interest in him and goes back to his consort. The king has Jangsaeng walk his tightrope blind. As Jangsaeng tells the story of his and Gong-gil's trials and tribulations while balancing on the rope, Gong-gil runs out to join him. Gong- gil asks Jangsaeng what he would like to return as in his next life and Jangsaeng replies that he would still choose to be a clown. Gong-gil answers that he too would return as nothing else but a clown. At the very end there is a popular uprising resulting in an attack on the palace, and as people storm the court, Jangsaeng and Gong-gil jump up from the rope together, and Jangsaeng tosses away his fan. The last scene is a happy one where Jangsaeng and Gong-gil appear to be reunited with their clowning troupe, including the friend who died earlier during the hunting incident. The whole company jokes, sings and dances, as they all walk away cheerfully into the distance.

It was based on a small passage from the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty that briefly mentions the king's favorite clown, Gong-gil, whereas Jang-saeng is a fictional character. In the Joseon Dynasty, \\"Yi\\" was what the king called his beloved subjects. Since first staged in 2000, the play has won numerous awards, including the best stage play of the year, best new actor (for Oh Man-seok) and top 3 best plays of the year by the National Theater Association of Korea, and best stage play for 2001 by the Dong-A Art Foundation. http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150624001209 Original soundtrack # \\"가려진\\" - \\"Veiled\\" by Jang Jae-hyeong (Jang-seng's theme) # \\"프롤로그 - 먼길\\" - \\"Prologue - Long Roads\\" # \\"각시탈\\" - \\"Gak-shi Tal (Mask of a Woman)\\" # \\"돌아올 수 없는\\" - \\"Cannot Return\\" # \\"너 거기 있니? 나 여기 있어.\\" - \\"Are you over there?

This led to its commercial success, which is remarkable, considering its focus on traditional arts with homosexual themes. The success was also surprising given the lack of a big budget and high- profile top-billing actors and director compared to other films such as Taegukgi: Brotherhood of War and Silmido, who have both surpassed 10 million viewers. The film also notably propelled the then unknown Lee Joon-gi into Asia-wide stardom. This film was chosen by the Korea Film Council-appointed committee as South Korea's submission for the 2006 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was selected over two other films: The Host and Time for its overall aesthetic and commercial quality. Nafees Ahmed of High On Films called the film 'a Shakespearean tragedy' and wrote, \\"It's a well written and directed historical drama that weaves the emotional nuances of the king and two clowns into the layered drama about love, jealousy, madness and compassion.\\" International release * Taiwan: May 7, 2006 * Singapore: June 22, 2006 * Canada: September 7, 2006 (Vancouver/Toronto Film Festival) * Japan: October 21, 2006 (Tokyo Film Festival) / December 9, 2006 (theatrical release) * Shanghai: October 28, 2006 * United Kingdom: October 29, 2006 (London Film Festival) * South Africa: November 14, 2006 (Cape Town Film Festival) * New Zealand: December 1, 2006 (Film Festival) * United States: January 3, 2007 (Los Angeles) * Italy: March 30, 2007 (Florence Film Festival) * France: April 1, 2007 (Deauville Film Festival) / 23 January 2008 (theatrical release) Awards and nominations ;2006 Baeksang Arts Awardshttp://www.cinemasie.com/en/fiche/oeuvre/kingandtheclown/recompenses.html * Grand Prize for Film * Best New Actor - Lee Joon-gi * Nomination - Best Film * Nomination - Best Director - Lee Joon-ik * Nomination - Best Actor - Jung Jin-young * Nomination - Best Screenplay - Choi Seok-hwan ;2006 Chunsa Film Art Awards * Best Actor - Kam Woo-sung * Best Supporting Actor - Jang Hang-sun ;2006 Grand Bell Awards * Best Film * Best Director - Lee Joon-ik * Best Actor - Kam Woo-sung * Best Supporting Actor - Yoo Hae-jin * Best New Actor - Lee Joon-gi * Best Screenplay - Choi Seok-hwan * Best Cinematography - Ji Kil- woong * Nomination - Best Supporting Actress - Kang Sung-yeon * Nomination - Best Editing - Kim Jae-bum, Kim Sang-bum * Nomination - Best Lighting - Han Gi-eop * Nomination - Best Art Direction - Kang Seung-yong * Nomination - Best Costume Design - Shim Hyun-sub * Nomination - Best Music - Lee Byung-woo * Nomination - Best Sound - Kim Tan-young, Choi Tae-young ;2006 Blue Dragon Film Awards * Best Music - Lee Byung-woo * Nomination - Best Film * Nomination - Best Director - Lee Joon-ik * Nomination - Best Actor - Kam Woo-sung * Nomination - Best Supporting Actor - Yoo Hae-jin * Nomination - Best Supporting Actress - Kang Sung-yeon * Nomination - Best New Actor - Lee Joon- gi * Nomination - Best Lighting - Han Gi-eop * Nomination - Best Art Direction - Kang Seung-yong * Nomination - Technical Award - Kim Sang-bum, Kim Jae-bum (Editing) ;2006 Korean Film Awards * Best New Actor - Lee Joon-gi * Nomination - Best Film * Nomination - Best Director - Lee Joon-ik * Nomination - Best Supporting Actress - Kang Sung-yeon * Nomination - Best Art Direction - Kang Seung-yong ;2007 Deauville American Film Festival * Jury Prize See also *List of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender-related films by storyline  References   External links   * King and the Clown fan site Category:2005 films Category:2000s historical comedy-drama films Category:South Korean films Category:South Korean historical comedy-drama films Category:South Korean LGBT-related films Category:Fictional kings Category:Fictional clowns Category:Films about clowns Category:Films about politicians Category:Films set in the 15th century Category:Films set in the Joseon Dynasty Category:Films set in Seoul Category:South Korean films based on plays Category:Films directed by Lee Joon-ik Category:Best Picture Grand Bell Award winners Category:Cinema Service films Category:CJ Entertainment films Category:Korean-language films Category:LGBT-related comedy-drama films ","title":"The King and the Clown"},{"id":"3917900","text":"The Contract is a 2006 German-American action thriller film directed by Bruce Beresford and written by television writer Stephen Katz and John Darrouzet. The Contract stars Morgan Freeman as assassin Frank Carden and John Cusack as teacher Ray Keene. Released direct to video in the United States and most of Europe, The Contract received little critical notice despite its high-profile cast. Plot Frank Carden (Morgan Freeman) is a professional assassin who has been hired to kill a reclusive billionaire named Lydell Hammond, Sr., a vocal opponent of stem cell research. Carden's plan goes awry when he gets injured in a car accident and ends up in the hospital. When hospital staff see his gun, they call the police. They are able to peel away his false identity, and federal marshals are called in to pick him up. Widower Ray Keene (John Cusack), a high school gym teacher, ex-cop, and well-intentioned but not very able dad to Chris (Jamie Anderson), belatedly realizes the need to bond with his son when the latter gets caught smoking marijuana and takes him hiking in the wilderness. Carden is being driven through that same wilderness by the marshals, but his men stage a rescue attempt. The car is crashed, and most of the marshals end up dead. The surviving marshal asks Keene to take the prisoner to the authorities and then dies of his injuries. Ray and Chris have to get Carden out of the wilderness and hand him over to the authorities. Carden's men, highly skilled ex-military thugs, track them down to rescue Carden and kill the Keenes. The pursuit brings a couple, Sandra and Lochlan (Megan Dodds and Ryan McCluskey) into the crossfire, with Lochlan being killed by Carden's men. In a tense standoff in a cabin in the woods, Carden's friends turn up, and Keene agrees to let Carden go. Just at that moment, one of Carden's thugs bursts in and punches Chris, causing Keene to panic and kill him, sustaining critical wounds in the process, while Sandra shoots the other as he enters firing. Carden escapes, taking Chris as a hostage, while Sandra and Keene are rescued by the local police. Miles (Alice Krige), Carden's mission handler, tells Davis (Corey Johnson), Carden's recent recruit, to kill Carden and Chris and to make it look like Carden did it. She also tells him to kill Keene in case Carden told him anything about his job. Feeling defeated and resting at home, a televised news report echoes an earlier conversation about Carden's job description with the key phrase \\"exterminating obstacles to progress\\" which makes Keene aware of Carden's intended target. Keene heads to the funeral of Hammond, Jr., to intercept Carden and inadvertently saves Carden from Davis. Carden gets the upper hand on Davis, killing him with his own sniper rifle. However, the battle forces Carden to miss his own window of opportunity to assassinate Hammond, Sr. Carden relents in giving Keene a set of keys to a hotel room where Carden locked up Chris, letting father and son reunite while he disappears. In Washington, D.C., Carden intercepts Miles, aware of her role in hiring Davis to kill him. Carden threatens to \\"come after her\\" if any harm were to come to the Keene family. Two weeks after the incident, Keene enters into a relationship with Sandra and holds a family barbecue, expressing disbelief in hearing a radio news report about Hammond, Sr., dying in a boating accident, realizing that Carden finished his contract killing.

They were part of the DRG's standard locomotive (Einheitslokomotive) series.  Pre World War II history  Since the success of the diesel high speed trains like the Flying Hamburger in the middle of the 1930s, the German locomotive industry turned to faster steam locomotives. After speed tests with a streamlined DRG Class 03 the Borsig locomotive factories produced three engines: * 05 001 in 1935, streamlined, * 05 002 in 1935, streamlined, world speed record in 1936 * 05 003 in 1937, cab forward streamlined. The locomotives did regular service in FD express passenger trains, e.g. FD 23 from Hamburg to Berlin. The design speed was 175 km/h (109 mph). In 1944, the streamline plates were removed. 05 003 had been rebuilt and lost the cab forward design.  World high speed records  05 001 and 05 002 were mainly used for test runs from 1935 to 1936. Most of these runs were made on complete journeys between Hamburg and Berlin. On 7 June 1935 the 05 002 made a top speed of near Berlin. The same engine made six more runs with more than with trains up to weight. On 11 May 1936 it set the world speed record for steam locomotives after reaching on the Berlin–Hamburg line hauling a train. The engine power was more than ). This record was broken two years later by the British LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard engine on a slightly downhill line. This record was set between Little Bytham and Essendine in South Lincolnshire. On 30 May 1936 the 05 002 set an unbroken start stop speed record for steam locomotives: During the return run from a 190 km/h test Berlin-Hamburg it did the ~ from Wittenberge to a signal stop before Berlin-Spandau in 48 min 32 s, meaning average between start and stop.  Post-War history  After World War II, the three engines came to the engine shop in Hamm, Westphalia. Since there were only three specimens of the 05, DB thought to scrap them. But then the engines were sent to Krauss-Maffei to be restored. 05 003 went into regular service in 1950, the other two in 1951. Boiler pressure was reduced to , hence the engines lost some of their old power. All three locomotives were used to haul express trains until 1958. Mostly the 05 hauled the FD (long distance express) trains \\"Hanseat\\" and \\"Domspatz\\" on the run Hamburg - Cologne - Frankfurt. The regular top speed of the trains was . On this run the 05 operated trains did the longest run with steam traction in the DB network. July 1958 the 05 were replaced by the diesel-hydraulic DB class V 200. 05 001 went to the Verkehrsmuseum Nürnberg, where it can be seen streamlined in large parts - the drivetrain on the right hand side remains visible - in its original red livery. The other two locomotives were scrapped in 1960.

The episode's teleplay was written by Phil Klemmer, with story by series creator Rob Thomas and was directed by Sarah Pia Anderson. The episode premiered on UPN on November 2, 2004. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica investigates a potentially rigged student election after her ex-boyfriend Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn) wins over more popular candidate Wanda Varner (Rachel Roth). Meanwhile, Logan faces the consequences of running an illegal boxing ring which brutally pits homeless people against each other, and Veronica investigates Lilly Kane's (Amanda Seyfried) murder further.  Synopsis  Logan (Jason Dohring) finds a mob of paparazzi waiting for him in the morning one day. He makes snide remarks, telling them to leave, but his movie star father, Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin), arrives and welcomes them. Meanwhile, Duncan (Teddy Dunn) talks to his father Jake (Kyle Secor) about running for school president. In addition, a cheerleader sees another girl, Wanda (Rachel Roth), get her food delivered, and she confronts journalism teacher Mallory Dent (Sydney Tamiia Poitier) about the problem. Eventually, a fight ensues between the two. Veronica says she used to be in pep squad with Wanda. At dinner that day, Keith and Veronica see on the news that the convicted murderer of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried), Abel Koontz, has fired his legal defense counsel. In newspaper class the next day, Veronica is tasked with covering the school election just as she sees that Wanda is running. Logan tells Duncan he should run. Later, Veronica interviews Wanda. She gives some politically charged responses, speaking out against the rich students and status quo. Duncan sees an ad for his presidential run on the school TV. The video is voiced by Logan's father and seems to have been created by Logan without Duncan's knowledge. Veronica decides to research more into Lilly's murder. She starts with listing all the suspects: Abel Koontz, Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill), Jake, and Duncan. She opens her father's safe and begins to look for clues. That night, Logan runs an illegal boxing ring. The next day, it is announced that Duncan has actually won the presidency, to the shock of the entire school. Veronica announces that \\"now [she's] got a story,\\" implying that she believes it was rigged. Later, Veronica talks with another faculty member, Mrs. Donaldson (Jane Lynch), who says that one adult must sign a request for the votes to be recounted. Veronica recruits the journalism teacher, and she accepts. Veronica runs through the ballots with Wallace and Wanda, but they still show a victory for Duncan. However, Veronica finds a ballot of a student who wrote \\"Wanda Rulez\\" on his form, but voted for Duncan. Veronica soon finds that the voting instructions for the ballots were different in different rooms. She confronts the principal about this, but he doubts her. It turns out that Madison Sinclair, an 09er girl, made the ballot orders, and Veronica considers the mystery solved. The principal gives in and a run-off is scheduled for that Thursday. That night, Veronica calls an adult reporter to ask him for his copy of a piece he did a few days ago on Abel Koontz. Jake pressures Duncan to win the election, though their interaction is more tender than other instances. Duncan asks, \\"What if I find happiness living in a grass hut, carving drift wood figurines for tourists?\\" Jake responds: \\"[...] if you're happy and committed to drift woods carving, be the best driftwood carver you can be... After you've graduated from Stanford... Law school... Summa cum laude.\\" Duncan laughs and the tension is eased for a moment. The next day, Veronica sees defaced Wanda posters and clean new Duncan posters. Veronica and Wanda decide to hang out and make new posters. In newspaper class, Veronica confronts Duncan about his role in the election, but he doesn't respond. That night, Logan finds his father, who cannot sleep due to the recent press about Logan's homeless boxing ring. On the day of the election, Veronica tries to give Weevil (Francis Capra) a Wanda bumper sticker. Weevil refuses, saying his friend Felix got in trouble for stealing traffic signs after sleeping with Wanda. Soon after, Veronica proposes they go to a rave in the desert, win or lose. Wanda asks if they'll need \\"provisions,\\" referring to ecstasy, and Veronica lies, saying she knows a dealer. Aaron Echolls tells Logan that he is going to force him to volunteer at a soup kitchen as a publicity response. It starts to go well, but Logan states that Aaron is donating $500,000 to the Neptune Food Bank, a promise Aaron never made. Later that day, Aaron whips Logan with a belt while Logan's mother sits in another room. Veronica is subject to an emergency locker check, after which she hears that Duncan won the presidency. Veronica realizes Wanda is ratting out other students to clear her record of a drug charge. When Veronica confronts her, Wanda admits to reporting other students because it's her only hope of maintaining a clear record and getting into college. Veronica replies that there are no hard feelings since she didn't vote for Wanda. Later that day, Veronica receives her package from the reporter and starts to lie to Keith about its contents before telling her dad the truth and pleading with him to reopen the case. She shows the footage of Abel Koontz's arrests and the shoes decorated by Veronica that one of the images contains. Keith asks what she thinks those shoes were doing with Abel Koontz, and Veronica responds, \\"Good question.\\"  Arc significance  *Abel Koontz fires his public defender. *Veronica finds out that the pair of Lilly's shoes found on Abel Koontz's houseboat were still in her room after her murder. *We find out that Logan is being abused by his father.  Cultural references  A variety of pop culture references are made in the episode: *Wanda refers to Xanadu, possibly a reference to Charles Foster Kane's mansion in Citizen Kane. *Wanda refers to Xanadu, possibly a reference as well to the film \\"Xanadu (film)\\" equating blond cheerleader Mallory Dent with \\"Olivia Newton-John\\" who plays a modern incarnation of \\"Terpsichore\\", the Greek \\"muse\\" of dance. *One of Wanda's campaign signs says \\"Give me liberty, or give me death!\\" *Logan makes a reference to A Fish Called Wanda, a 1988 heist film. *Logan's father says that Access Hollywood, Entertainment Tonight, and E! have been calling to ask about his son's actions. *Veronica compares her relationship to her father to the comic strip \\"Spy vs. Spy\\" from MAD Magazine.  Music  In addition to the series' theme song, \\"We Used to Be Friends\\", by The Dandy Warhols, the following music can be heard in the episode: *\\"Still in Love Song\\" by The Stills *\\"Feel Alright\\" by The Red Onions *\\"Bandido\\" by Daniel Indart *\\"I'm In a Way\\" by The Rite Flyers *\\"Ventura Highway\\" by America  Production  Jane Lynch (pictured) guest starred in \\"Return of the Kane\\". This episode was directed by Sarah Pia Anderson and co-written by series creator Rob Thomas (who wrote the story) and Phil Klemmer (who wrote the teleplay). This episode is the first to be directed by a female director. The episode's title is a joking reference to The Return of the King, the third volume of J.R.R. Tolkien's high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings, or possibly the 2003 film adaption of it, which was relatively new in that time. Among the episode's many guest stars is a young Jane Lynch, who would eventually find fame on Glee. In addition, a character by the name of Wanda Varner—who appears in a guest starring role in \\"Return of the Kane\\"—was featured in Rob Thomas's 1996 young adult novel Rats Saw God. Krysten Ritter originally auditioned for the role of Wanda in the episode. She would later play recurring character Gia Goodman in season 2 and the film adaptation of the show.  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, the episode was watched by 2.86 million viewers, ranking 104 of 111 in the weekly rankings. This was a slight increase in rating from the previous week's episode, \\"You Think You Know Somebody\\". = Reviews = The episode received mostly positive reviews. Television Without Pity gave the episode a \\"B+\\". Rowan Kaiser of The A.V.

She was called la petite reine (\\"the little queen\\") by Charles and contemporaries. According to Georges Bordonove, \\"Odette was the daughter of a maître d'hôtel of the King's Household, certain Guyot de Champdivers\\", who in fact was her brother. The messages of Père Anselme established her as a daughter of Odin or Oudin de Champdivers, who around 1387 was equerry stableman (Latin: marescallus equorum) at the court of King Charles VI.Père ANSELME-POTIER de COURCY, Histoire de la maison royale de France... 4e édition corrigée et complétée..., vol. IX, p. 828.Nouvelle biographie générale depuis les temps les plus reculés jusqu'à nos ..., by Hoefer (Jean Chrétien Ferdinand), Firmin-Didot, p. 474. She features in the novel Isabel de Bavière (1835) by Alexandre Dumas. Life =Family= Odette's family took their name after a fief that belonged to them, located near Dole and Saint-Jean-de-Losne in Burgundy. Rousset, in his study of the Municipalities of Juravol. I, 1855 stated that the old house of Champdivers probably descended from a younger branch of the House of Lorraine. It was also noted that the Lords of Champdivers had existed since 1160. On 20 April 1154, the name is mentioned in a bull of Pope Urban IV. In the Middle Ages, the Champdivers were vassals of the Dukes of Burgundy, and they lived in a mansion that was destroyed in 1477 by King Louis XI. One of Odette's siblings was Henry de Champdivers, who married Joan of Toulongeon, widow of Tristan de Montholon—commander of the cavalry of the Dukes of Brabant and Burgundy on 25 October 1415 at the Battle of Agincourt, where he was killed—La Chesnaie-des-Bois et Panthéon de la Légion d'honneur - page 497, of Théophile Lamathière. and sister of two marshals of Burgundy and an equerry of a French one Grand Squire of France. It is also known that Henry was knighted and in 1394 followed Duke Philip II the Bold during his trip to Brittany. Guyot de Champdivers, another of her brothers, is mentioned in September 1391 in the royal accounts as one of the pages and squires who served in the household of Queen Isabeau of Bavaria. In 1407, Guyot de Champdivers reappears as a squire baker of the Duke of Burgundy with a pension of 200 pounds. The same Guyot (or Guillaume) de Champdivers therefore remained a staunch partisan of both Burgundian Dukes, John the Fearless and later Philip III the Good. He served this two princes as an advisor of the King and the Duke in the most important cases including approximately between 1413 and 1425. =Royal Mistress (1407–1422)= Charles VI of France and Odette Although her family was Burgundian (i.e., supporters of the Duke of Burgundy), in early 1407 the seventeen-year-old Odette became the mistress of King Charles VI after the death of his brother Louis I, Duke of Orléans, Burgundy's rival. Queen Isabeau, the victim of beatings and abuse from her violent, schizophrenic husband, allowed Odette to substitute for her without difficulty. By some accounts, she herself arranged for Odette to take her place in the mentally ill king's bed; by others it is believed that Duke John the Fearless offered the young Odette to the King, in order to ensure the influence of the Burgundian party. Odette and Charles VI had only one daughter together, called Marguerite, who was born by the end of 1407. Called la petite reine – \\"the little queen\\" – by Charles's court, Odette was described as a lively, beautiful young woman with a gentle disposition. Apparently she loved and cared for her unhappy sovereign with the utmost patience and devotion. She is credited with introducing playing cards into France, \\"for the amusement of [Charles VI] during his paroxysms of insanity\\".Pardoe, 177–178. According to some authors, Odette wore the clothes of the Queen in the royal bed each night, and Charles did not notice the substitution. Honoré de Balzac refers to her selflessness in one of his earlier novels, La Dernière fée: During the almost fifteen years of their relationship, the King gave Odette rich gifts as a reward for her dedication to him; she also received two fine manors in Créteil and Bagnolet (the latter probably located in Malassis),Les femmes célèbres de l'ancienne France, mémoires historiques sur la vie ..., by Antoine Le Roux de Lincy, p. 420. and the estate of Belleville in Poitou.Hare, 261.\\"Charles gave Odette the estate of Belleville in Poitou.\\" Hamel, 135. Odette was at the King's side on his deathbed (21 October 1422); it is said that the last words of Charles VI were her name: \\"Odette, Odette\\". Queen Isabeau was absent from her husband's funeral. =After the death of King Charles VI (1422–1425)= Charles and Odette by Eugène Delacroix In 1423 Odette took refuge in Saint-Jean-de-Losne. The pension given to her from the royal treasure by the King was no longer paid; for this, in October and December of that year, Odette received some monetary help from Duke Philip III the Good. After the King's death, the royal treasure was taken by the English, and in consequence, Odette and her teenage daughter were reduced to poverty. Odette took refuge in her homeland, under the protection of the Duke of Burgundy. In April 1424 she lived in the hotel of La Croix de Fer in Dijon. Étienne Chariot, native of Bourbonnais and monk in the convent of Beuvray-lès- Autun, visited Dijon at that time. The \\"little queen\\" (a nickname by which she was called by all) sent his squire, a son of Jean Trestelet, from Saint-Jean- de-Losne, with a message to the monk, who visited and talked with her. This monk Étienne was an envoy of the Dauphin Charles, with orders to spy on the movements of Duke Philip III. Through the monk Étienne, Odette could warn the Dauphin about the imminent massacre of his supporters in Lyon by Burgundian and English forces.Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes, by Société de l'École des chartes, p. 178. As soon as he learned this, the Dauphin sent instructions to the seneschal in Lyon to avoid the planned attack. Soon after, the monk received orders from the Dauphin: the \\"little queen\\" must be taken to Châlons during Holy Week, probably for her own safety. However, monk Étienne was captured by the Burgundians and forced to talk. Odette and her daughter were called to court; the former royal mistress was interrogated with a certain solemnity at the request of the chancellor Rolin in the presence of the High Council of the Duke. Odette defended herself and her daughter with great skill and determination. Odette de Champdivers disappears from records after 6 September 1424. There is some indication that she died in great poverty.Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes, by Société de l'École des chartes, p. 179. She probably died in the Dauphiné in 1425, actually in poverty.Nouvelle biographie générale depuis les temps les plus reculés jusqu'à nos ..., by Hoefer (Jean Chrétien Ferdinand), Firmin-Didot, p. 475.

Co-written by Jed Seidel and Diane Ruggiero and directed by Nick Marck, the episode premiered on UPN on November 9, 2004. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica looks into the mysterious disappearance of her neighbor, Sarah (Jessica Chastain). Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring) and Weevil (Francis Capra) have to deal with each other in detention.  Synopsis  The episode begins in medias res. Veronica sits outside of an apartment building, and we see a stretcher being carried off. Through voiceovers, Veronica tells that she was in some way connected to the crime. The episode then flashes back to one week earlier. Then, Veronica meets Sarah, a heavily pregnant neighbor, who asks her for help with a missing journal that she believes her boyfriend stole. In newspaper class, Mallory Dent (Sydney Tamiia Poitier) shows a woman, Evelyn Bugby (Bonita Friedericy) to Veronica and asks for her help with a project on the class of '79. She eventually agrees to help with the project. Veronica looks through the old yearbook and sees a photo of her mother, Lianne. During a test, a teacher, Mr. Daniels (Steven Williams) fails both Logan and Weevil for talking. They are placed in detention, during which the two bicker and eventually play poker. The teacher comes in and sentences them to a full week of detention. Veronica returns home and views Sarah and her boyfriend, André (Adam Kaufman), arguing. That night, Veronica is awakened by a woman's scream overhead and a body falling. The next morning, Veronica goes to Sarah's door to take her to a doctor's appointment, but there is no response. She looks through the window to see the room in disarray, and Sarah's dog alone, barking. In the bathroom one day, another student talks to Weevil, and it is heavily implied that Weevil was carrying out an affair with Lilly Kane. Veronica talks to Duncan (Teddy Dunn) about something she found in the yearbook—that Veronica's mother, Lianne (Corrine Bohrer) and Jake Kane (Kyle Secor) were once a couple in high school. A flashback details Veronica's breakup with Duncan, which was abrupt and mystified Veronica. At Sarah's workplace, her boss says that he doesn't know where Sarah is either. He also gives Veronica the information that she fights with her boyfriend a lot. Veronica goes to find André. She questions him, but he dismisses it as a simple fight and nothing serious. She doesn't believe him, and these suspicions are heightened when it turns out that André is painting a portrait of a female nude who is not Sarah. Veronica sneaks into Sarah's apartment and finds some mysterious things, including Sarah's phone and a gun. André comes in and finds Veronica. She manages to escape with minimal conflict. In another flashback, Veronica asks Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried) why Duncan broke up with her, but she is vague and unspecific. In detention, Logan states that he has a plan to get the teacher back, which involves stealing the teacher's car and putting it on the flagpole. Weevil is told by the principal that he is expelled in the aftermath of the prank. After Veronica gives Sarah's parents Keith's card, they visit Keith. Afterwards, Keith tells Veronica that he does not want her on the case. However, she convinces him otherwise as long as she stays away from André. She finds out that Sarah's baby is not André's. Logan confesses to the prank as well. Veronica visits Sarah's boss again, and she finds out from the boss that Sarah was raped and that the baby might be the child of the rapist. Veronica calls Weevil's motorcycle gang, and they come in order to convince the boss to give Veronica Sarah's journal, which he stole. This works successfully. Weevil is un-expelled and they are both sentenced to a punishment of removing graffiti. Logan finds a tattoo with Lilly's name on it, but Weevil comes up with an adequate lie. Veronica reads Sarah's notebook and finds her near her car. Sarah goes back to André. Over dinner, Keith asks Veronica who the father is. Meanwhile, upstairs Sarah's parents find out that she was raped, and the actual father of the child was Sarah's stepfather. Keith and Veronica come and help, and Keith ends up shooting the stepfather. We then return to the point at which the episode began.  Arc significance  *While gathering information on the Class of '79 reunion, Veronica finds out that her mom and Jake Kane dated in high school. *In a flashback, Veronica asks Lilly to find out why Duncan broke up with her. The next day, Lilly had apparently found something out and tells her to forget him and move on. *Vice Principal Clemmons tells Logan to remind his father the offer he made about donating his boots from one of his hit movies to the school. *Logan finds out that Weevil has a tattoo of \\"Lilly\\".

This episode is the final episode for actress Sydney Tamiia Poitier, who portrayed Mallory Dent in a total of four episodes. Her abrupt departure from the show was due to her pregnancy in real life. She continued to be credited as starring until the ninth episode of the first season, \\"Drinking the Kool-Aid\\". In addition, series regular Percy Daggs III, who portrays Wallace Fennel, is absent from \\"The Girl Next Door\\". Among the episode's many guest stars is Jessica Chastain, who would later rise to fame with her performances in the 2011 films The Tree of Life, Take Shelter and her Oscar-nominated roles in The Help and Zero Dark Thirty . Another one of the episode's guest stars is Adam Kaufman, whom series creator Rob Thomas later called on to play an unconnected FBI agent role in the unaired fourth season pilot of the show before Veronica Mars was cancelled altogether.  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, \\"The Girl Next Door\\" was watched by 2.74 million viewers, marking a slight drop from the previous episode, \\"Return of the Kane\\". The episode ranked 100 of 103 in the weekly rankings. = Reviews = The episode received a lukewarm critical reaction. Price Peterson of TV.com wrote in his episode verdict, \\"I gotta admit, I found the main plot more interesting than the case of the week. Not my favorite episode, but still totally watchable.\\" Television Without Pity gave the episode a \\"B-\\". In a fairly negative review, Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, commented negatively on both the case of the week and the B-story. He wrote, \\"The whole thing also had the negative effect of making Veronica seem passive. As a character, this is probably her least interesting episode.\\" However, the reviewer went on to praise the C-story involving Weevil and Logan, stating that, \\"On the bright side, the C-plot, involving Weevil and Logan in detention together, is simply magical, and makes the whole episode worthwhile.\\" TVLine ranked \\"The Girl Next Door\\" as the worst episode of the series, placing it last on its ranking of all Veronica Mars episodes.

It is used in vineyards, fruit-farms and gardens to prevent infestations of downy mildew, powdery mildew and other fungi. It is sprayed on plants as a preventive treatment; its mode of action is ineffective after a fungus has become established. It was invented in the Bordeaux region of France in the late 19th century. If it is applied in large quantities annually for many years, the copper in the mixture eventually becomes a pollutant. Bordeaux mixture in preparation Bordeaux mixture on grapes Main uses In addition to its use to control fungal infection on grape vines, the mixture is also widely used to control potato blight, peach leaf curl and apple scab.Pears, Pauline, et al. HDRA Encyclopedia Of Organic Gardening, pp103, Dorling Kindersley Ltd, London, 2005. It is approved for organic use, so is often used by organic gardeners where nonorganic gardeners would prefer other controls. Mode of action Bordeaux mixture achieves its effect by means of the copper ions (Cu2+) of the mixture. These ions affect enzymes in the fungal spores in such a way as to prevent germination. This means Bordeaux mixture must be used preventively, before the fungal disease has struck. Thorough coverage of the spray on the plants is necessary. The Bordeaux spray continues to adhere well to the plant during rain, though in the long term it is washed off by rain. Commonly in practice, it is applied just once a year, in the wintertime.\\"Bordeaux Mixture\\" @ Integrated Pest Management @ UC Davis. Preparation Bordeaux mixture can be prepared using differing proportions of the components. In preparing it, the CuSO4 and the lime are dissolved separately in water and then mixed. Calcium oxide (burnt lime) and calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) give the same end result, since an excess of water is used in the preparation. The conventional method of describing the mixture's composition is to give the weight of CuSO4, the weight of hydrated lime and the volume of water, in that order. The percentage of the weight of CuSO4 to the weight of water employed determines the concentration of the mixture. Thus a 1% Bordeaux mixture, which is typical, would have the formula 1:1:100, with the first \\"1\\" representing 1 kg CuSO4 (pentahydrated), the second representing 1 kg hydrated lime, and the 100 representing 100 litres (100 kg) water. As CuSO4 contains 25% copper, the copper content of a 1% Bordeaux mixture would be 0.25%. The quantity of lime used can be lower than that of the CuSO4. One kg of CuSO4 actually requires only 0.225 kg of chemically pure hydrated lime to precipitate all the copper. Good proprietary brands of hydrated lime are now freely available, but, as even these deteriorate on storage (by absorbing carbon dioxide from the air), a ratio of less than 2:1 is seldom used, which corresponds to a 1:0.5:100 mixture. Risks Bordeaux mixture has been found to be harmful to fish, livestock and—due to potential buildup of copper in the soil—earthworms. The chemical was in use as a blight preventive in the potato country of northern Maine by 1921.https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MANUSCRIPTS/maine/aroostookME1921/aroostookME1921.pdf Hurst, Lewis A. (1921) Soil Survey of the Aroostook Area, Maine, p.13 It started to be used by the United Fruit Company throughout Latin America around 1922. The mixture was nicknamed perico, or \\"parakeet\\", because it would turn workers completely blue. Many workers would get sick or die of poisoning due to the toxic chemical.Banana: The Fate of the Fruit That Changed the World by Dan Koeppel History In the 19th century, several outbreaks of vine diseases occurred among the Vitis vinifera vines of the classical European wine regions. These outbreaks were caused by pests to which these vines lacked resistance, carried on vines brought to Europe as botanical specimens of American origin. These pests included not only the Great French Wine Blight caused by the aphid Phylloxera vastatrix, but also mildew and other diseases caused by fungi.Some of these diseases are caused by fungi-like organisms in the Oomycete group, which no longer are considered fungi. Since they are more closely related to the algae, they are currently classified as part of the heterokonts, but the term \\"fungal diseases\\" is fairly well established as an umbrella term. After the downy mildew had struck, botany professor Pierre- Marie-Alexis Millardet of the University of Bordeaux studied the disease in vineyards of the Bordeaux region. Millardet then noted that vines closest to the roads did not show mildew, while all other vines were affected. After inquiries, he found out those vines had been sprayed with a mixture of CuSO4 and lime to deter passersby from eating the grapes, since this treatment was both visible and bitter-tasting. This led Millardet to conduct trials with this treatment. The trials primarily took place in the vineyards of Château Dauzac, where he was assisted by Ernest David, Dauzac's technical director. Millardet published his findings in 1885, and recommended the mixture to combat downy mildew. In France, the use of Bordeaux mixture has also been known as the Millardet-David treatment.

Written by Aury Wallington and directed by Guy Bee, the episode premiered on UPN on November 23, 2004. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, when someone publicly releases the results of an online purity test and causes chaos at the school, Veronica goes on the case. Meanwhile, Veronica attempts to obtain information from the confessed killer of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried), Abel Koontz. Synopsis Veronica looks at photos of Lilly Kane's murder site that she found earlier. Then, Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris) enters and Veronica asks him for entry into death row to see Abel Koontz (Christian Clemenson). Cliff denies her advances. Later that day, after gym class, Veronica finds that her clothes are missing and that someone stuffed them in the toilet. A cheerleader, Meg Manning (Alona Tal), gives her uniform to Veronica. Meg goes over to her friends, one of whom is Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn), and they talk about a popular purity test. Later, Veronica and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) are hanging out, and Wallace's mom, Alicia (Erica Gimpel) eventually barges in and berates him privately for being friends with Veronica. Veronica finds a website where she can look up the results of anyone's purity test. There is chaos at school the next day after someone makes the results of the test public. Veronica then tells Meg that she will find the person who made the test public. The next day, Veronica meets Mac (Tina Majorino) when she needs help with a computer problem. They start to investigate who made the results public. Later, Veronica spies Alicia with a man (Joel Bissonnette) at night. Later that day, Veronica meets Meg, who tells her that she is being harassed. It turns out that Meg's sister actually created and published a test specifically for her. Veronica goes to an attractive IT faculty member, who refuses to give her a student's password. A few moments later, Meg fails her audition for Cabaret when other students harass her. Veronica emails Abel Koontz under a fake name in order to get access to his cell. Later, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) fails to convince Mrs. Fennel to give her his help with the tenant (the man we saw earlier), who was being abusive towards her. In addition, Veronica receives a call which states that Koontz has accepted her visitation request. The next day, Veronica questions Meg's sister, but she says that Meg didn't come to school that day. It turns out that Meg received erotic letters from a crush when on vacation. Wallace decides to sleep over at Veronica's house after the tenant becomes more disruptive. Keith does some work on the Fennel case and eventually catches the thief attempting to steal some food. Keith attempts to force him to leave the house by 6:00 AM. He eventually succeeds. Veronica does some more research with Mac, and they eventually find that someone is logged onto Veronica's account. Veronica eventually finds an empty computer in the journalism room which contains an embarrassing untrue email. Veronica eventually tracks down the suspect (the IT guy) while he is having sex in a car. She confronts Kimmy (Annie Abrams), the girl who was involved with the IT man, but she states that she was not involved with Veronica's purity test leak, only Meg's. She blames another student, Pam (Shanna Collins), for Veronica's cyberbullying. Later, Meg thanks Veronica. Veronica talks to Duncan and says that the email was fake. However, he jokingly responds, indicating a possible new emotional connection between the two. Mrs. Fennel visits Keith and thanks him, also indicating that they will allow their children to still be friends. Veronica visits Abel Koontz. The visit starts to go well, but Abel once again confesses to the murder and states that he recognizes her. He puts it in her mind that she is possibly not Keith's daughter and is in fact the daughter of Lianne (Corrine Bohrer) and Jake Kane (Kyle Secor). Veronica gets into her car and breaks down sobbing.  Cultural references  A variety of pop culture references are made in the episode: * The episode's title refers to Madonna's sophomore album Like a Virgin and its lead single of the same name. * Meg and Kimmy both audition for the lead role of Sally in Cabaret. In addition, the episode mentions the title song of the musical. * Meg was the lead role in Guys and Dolls. * Cole references the Lewinsky scandal when describing his relationship with Meg by using the phrase, \\"I did not have sexual relations with that woman.\\" * Veronica refers to the science fiction comedy film Repo Man.

IGN ranked the episode ninth on its list of \\"The Top 10 Veronica Mars episodes,\\" stating that, \\"The moment when Keith gets rid of Alicia's unwanted tenant is about the time you realize that a Keith-focused spinoff could be amazing.\\" Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, lauded the episode, writing that \\"the high school scandals were fun and surprising, while the Lilly Kane investigation took a turn for the serious.\\" In addition, the reviewer praised the final scene in which Veronica breaks down in the car. \\"It was the first time we'd seen such a raw display of emotion from our intrepid heroine, so it was as unsettling as it was heartbreaking. Poor Veronica!\\" Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club, in a mixed review, stated that \\"As a vehicle for introducing moderately important new characters, [the episode] succeeds.\\" However, the reviewer went on to write that the \\"major issue is that the plot is absolutely riddled with holes.\\"  References   External links  *\\"Like a Virgin\\" at Mars Investigations Category:2004 American television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 1) episodes ","title":"Like a Virgin (Veronica Mars)"},{"id":"3918035","text":"Arcada Software was a former American computer software company, that was based in California.

Original band members consisted of Dave Coutts (vocals, guitar), Jim Schumacher (keyboards, vocals), Mark Templin (guitar), Rusty Riopelle (bass), and Steve Coutts (drums). Although the original band never got signed to a major label, their music was well accepted within the college communities. Their 1984 12\\" single \\"Good for the Soul\\" received heavy rotation and made it to No. 3 on radio station KNAC, Long Beach. In March 1984, Ten Inch Men performed their first stadium size show at Long Beach State, opening for the punk band X. Between 1984 and 1985, several unreleased live shows and studio recordings were recorded. Spin-off videos were created from the songs \\"Eyes Of Blue\\", \\"High Society\\" and \\"Pink Champage\\"; all three aired briefly on a local Long Beach cable station. In 1986, Ten Inch Men released their four-song EP Hours in Pain containing the original recordings of \\"Flower Power\\", \\"Bars Of Time\\", \\"Brick Wall\\" and \\"New Eyes\\". \\"Flower Power\\" became their signature song & made it to No. 1 in New York City with light to medium airplay on many college radio stations across the country. Late in 1986, the original members parted ways, creating a void until Dave Coutts, Mark Templin & Steve Coutts brought in Lisa Marie Presley's first husband Danny Keough to play bass. This lineup remained until the band's 1993 Victory release Pretty Vultures. John McCloy played bass on the record Pretty Vultures as well as toured with the band after its release. After the band's final disbandment in 1993, Mark Templin married Carrie Hamilton, the daughter of Joe Hamilton and Carol Burnett, and former Ten Inch Men singer Dave Coutts joined members of the Stone Temple Pilots to create the band Talk Show, who released their eponymously named album in 1997. Despite Dave Coutts being regarded as an excellent rock music vocalist, and solid album reviews, the release did not do well commercially. Talk Show disbanded in early 1998.

In 1774, while anti-British colonists also known as Whigs or Patriots tried to stage a boycott on British goods, Jesse Dunbar bought some \\"fat cattle\\" from Mr. Thomas, a Mandamus Counsellor from England. The purchase was a violation of the boycott, but by no means illegal. He was approximately 31 years old at the time. After driving the oxen back home to the town of Plymouth, Jesse Dunbar slaughtered, skinned, and hung up one of the oxen. Rumor spread about where the oxen had come from, and soon a committee of Whigs came to extralegally enforce the boycott by stuffing Jesse Dunbar into the belly of the ox carcass. After stuffing Dunbar into the belly of the ox, the Plymouth mob put the ox carcass into a cart and pushed the cart 4 miles out of town. The mob also stole three more cattle and a horse from Mr. Dunbar. The Plymouth mob forced Jesse Dunbar to pay them one dollar for the ride. The Plymouth mob also handed over the punishment of Jesse Dunbar over to a mob from Kingston, Massachusetts. The Kingston mob put the carcass onto a cart belonging to a Mr. William Arnold. At first the Kingston Mob allowed Jesse Dunbar to walk alongside the ox-cart in shame (as the procession was apparently being kept under control by a Captain Wait Wadsworth). But this brief period of merciful treatment was cut short when many boys - \\"collected in great numbers\\" according to Justin Winsor - among the mob started dancing around Jesse Dunbar for the purpose of mocking him. It is not known whether it was an accident or not, but any case, Jesse Dunbar started tripping some of the children's feet up with his own as they danced around him. The Kingston Mob was so outraged by the incident with the children that they forced him back into the belly of ox carcass with renewed violence. After 4 miles the Kingston mob handed Jesse Dunbar and the ox over to a mob in Duxborough, Massachusetts. The Duxborough (also spelled Duxbury) mob started beating him in the face with the ox's tripe. Two sources mention the mob \\"endeavoring to cover his entire person in it [the inards of the ox carcass].\\" Jesse Dunbar almost asphyxiated from all the crowd forcing tripe into his face - \\"to the endangerment of his life.\\" As he was choking on the tripe, they threw some dirt on him. After some other abuses at the Duxborough mob, the tormentors carried Jesse Dunbar to Mr. Thomas's house and tipped him out in front of the door. The sum of money that the Duxborough mob took from him is unknown. According to the Rivington Gazette, the story of his torture ends with the Duxborough mob making \\"him pay another sum of money, and he not taking the beef, they flung it in the road and quitted him.\\" Somehow Jesse Dunbar survived this incident, and may well have gone on living in Plymouth County next to the neighbors who had stolen his property and his dignity. According to his tombstone, located at the Alden or Great Woods Graveyard in Bridgewater, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, Dunbar died on April 9, 1816 at the age of 73. His epitaph reads: \\"In memory of Mr. Jesse Dunbar, who died April 9, 1816, aged 73 years Honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, Nor is it measured in number of years; but wisdom is the Gray hair unto man, and an unspotted life is old age.\\" His wife, Abigail Dunbar, died a year later. She was three years older than he. Another tombstone in the graveyard shows that he had a daughter named Dinah with what must have been his first wife, Azuba. Azuba Dunbar is not buried in the cemetery.

The name Brewarrina is derived from 'burru waranha', a Weilwan name for a species of Acacia, Cassia tree, \\"Acacia clumps\\", \\"a native standing\\" or \\"place where wild gooseberry grows\\". It is east of Bourke and west of Walgett on the Kamilaroi Highway, and from Sydney. The population of Brewarrina in 2016 was 1,143. Other towns and villages in the Brewarrina district include; Goodooga, Gongolgon, Weilmoringle and Angledool. The site of the Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission is now heritage-listed. History Brewarrina Court House Plan of Baiame's Ngunnhu or Native Fish Traps The town is located amid the traditional lands of the Muruwari, Ngemba, Weilwan and Yualwarri peoples. The area has a long Indigenous Australian history and was once the meeting ground for over 5,000 people. The first settlers arrived in the district around 1839–40. The first people to own land where the town now stands were the Lawson brothers, who had two holdings - one called \\"Walcha\\" and another called \\"Moona\\" The town was first known as \\"Walcha Hut\\" but this later changed to \\"Brewarrina\\". In 1859, somewhere between 300-400 Aboriginal people were massacred by white settlers in an event known as the Hospital Creek Massacre, recollections of which vary. A memorial was erected by the local Aboriginal Land Council near the site of the massacre. In 1859 a riverboat called Gemini, skippered by William Randell, reached the town. This opened the possibility of developing the town as a port, and by the early 1860s Brewarrina was recognised as the furthest navigable point on the Darling River. Brewarrina became a port for shipping wool to Adelaide via the Darling and Murray rivers. The town was formally surveyed and laid out in 1861 and proclaimed on 28 April 1863. The paddle steamer Wandering Jew of 66 tonnes, 22 × 4.4 × 1.5 m, was built in 1866 and registered at Sydney. On 15 December 1914, Wandering Jew was lost due to a fire on Barwon River, Brewarrina. \\"The Wandering Jew represents an earlier maritime era and provides a direct link to the riverine heritage of Brewarrina. Its colourful history and repeated damage by fire is evocative of the dramas associated with riverboat travel\\". The 1870s were something of a boom time for Brewarrina. The courthouse was built in 1871. The Telegraph reached town in 1873. The Mechanics Institute formed in 1873. The following year two hotels, two stores and the Commercial Bank all opened, and in 1875 The Parish of Brewarrina was formed and public school was opened. All this development was largely due to Cobb and Co, which had a number of coach services passing through the town. There was a service from Byrock, one from Dubbo via Warren and, in 1874, a direct service from Brewarrina to Enngonia, north of Bourke. The number of people moving through the town at this time would have been considerable and would have given rise to the increase in stores and hotels. The Barwon Bridge opened in 1888, the previous method of crossing the Barwon River was by punt and pontoon. The impetus for Brewarrina bridge, was to capture the New South Wales wool trade from the river paddle steamers and direct it away from Melbourne and Adelaide to Sydney. It is a rare bridge because it, and the lift bridge at North Bourke, are the only surviving examples of the first series of lift bridges in New South Wales. The bridge has been assessed as being of state significance and is listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. In 1901 the Brewarrina railway line opened to Brewarrina from Byrock, on the Nyngan to Bourke line. The Brewarrina Line closed in 1974, and the wood-framed Brewarrina Station burned to the ground in 1980. The local telephone exchange was established in 1913. The town was surveyed in 1920. Brewarrina was used as a location for the Australian silent film Moora Neya, or The Message of the Spear (1911).Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 21 The Brewarrina Ngemba Billabong has a strong cultural history. From 1876 to 1967 the Ngemba Billabong was the Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission for local Aboriginal people whose land was taken for grazing. The entire 261 hectare property is listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. The Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission was the oldest institutional-type community in the state, it ran until 1965. Brewarrina Mission was the first institution formally established by the Aborigines Protection Board as part of its policy to segregate Aboriginal people. In August 1987 Brewarrina erupted into a riot that was triggered by the death in police custody of Lloyd James Boney. On 10 August 1987 the Prime Minister Bob Hawke announced a Royal Commission into indigenous deaths in custody.  Heritage listings  Brewarrina has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Brewarrina Aboriginal Fish Traps * The Old Mission Road: Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission Site Ancient Aboriginal fish traps The Brewarrina fish traps 2008 Brewarrina's most significant feature is its Aboriginal fish traps. Known in the local Aboriginal language as Baiame's Ngunnhu. It is believed that Ngemba, Wonkamurra, Wailwan and Gomolaroi people have shared and maintained the traps for thousands of years. The age of the fish traps is currently unknown, but they may be the oldest human construction in the world. Locals claim that the traps are at least 40,000 years old and thus the oldest surviving human-made structure in the world. Consisting of river stones arranged to form small channels, the traps direct fish into small areas from which they are readily plucked. The traps form a complex net of linked weirs and ponds along of the river. They operate at varying water heights and can be altered to suit seasonal changes. People use their expert knowledge of fish species and the environment to maximise their catch. Brewarrina Ngemba Billabong has been declared a World Conservation Union (IUCN) Category V and VI protected area. It was declared an Indigenous Protected Area in November 2010. The ready availability of fish made Brewarrina one of the great intertribal meeting places of pre-European eastern Australia. Climate Brewarrina has the typical hot semi-arid climate of north-western New South Wales, with hot summers frequently over , cool winters and generally dry all year round. Brewarrina's highest recorded temperature was on 19 December 1912, whilst its coldest was on 14 July 1997. The average annual rainfall is .  Sport and recreation  The townspeople of Brewarrina play a variety of sports. The town has a local Rugby Union club and team, the Brewarrina Brumbies. Rugby league is a very popular sport in Brewarrina, with the town sporting a number of different teams. Local players Alby Carr, Ron Gibbs, Les Biles, Isaac Gordon and his cousin Ashley Gordon played first grade in the National Rugby League. Netball is played weekly, with over 12 teams playing in the local competition. The Brewarrina Golf Club is renowned throughout the western region as one of the best 'oiled' green golf courses. Other major sports in Brewarrina include bowls, shooting, tennis and swimming. The river is also used for swimming and water skiing in the summer months. The Brewarrina Circus Skills Training Project is a program, which trains local kids skills in circus acts and gives them the opportunity to travel across the country to places like Adelaide and Melbourne. The Brewarrina Youth Circus was a partnership with the Brewarrina Council and Brewarrina Central School with objectives to increase school attendance. This program has also given particular kids the chance to travel overseas, with one girl travelling to South Africa to perform in the art of circus skills.  Events  Brewarrina plays host to one of the most famous rodeos in the far west of New South Wales. The Brewarrina Show and Rodeo Society runs a successful annual rodeo program which attracts a large crowd to town. Unfortunately over the last number of years, the Brewarrina Show has not been held. The Brewarrina Races are an important race meet in the Brewarrina district hosted by the Brewarrina Jockey Club. The race meet is usually held in May and has a large prize pool, complete with an extensive race program, fashions on the field, as well as other novelty races and lucky door prizes. In more recent years, Brewarrina has played host to the Brewarrina Field Day, which came about as an event for people from the district to have a day out in the time after devastating drought. It showcases over 70 stalls, wildlife and agricultural exhibits, quick shear competitions, carnival rides, dog jumping trials, as well as food and bar stalls. The Bre Big Fish is an annual fishing competition run in Brewarrina over the June Long Weekend. It is hosted by the Brewarrina Fishing Club and draws many fishing, hunting and camping enthusiasts to the district. In bygone years, Brewarrina was well renowned for its annual \\"Festival of the Fisheries\\", which celebrated Brewarrina's Aboriginal and European History. Brewarrina also hosted the unique \\"Surfboat Classic\\", which attracted a number of Surf Life Saving Clubs from the New South Wales Coast. Unfortunately these events have not been held in recent years. In April 2013, Brewarrina celebrated the 150th year since it was gazetted as a town in 1863. This was celebrated by a week long festival which included: Brewarrina Race Club meeting with over 2000 attendees, Bre Big Fish Competition, Street Parade and Carnival, Film Festival, Historical Exhibitions, Black Tie Ball, Fireworks Display, Flower and Cake Show, as well as a number of celebratory sporting fixtures including Rugby League and Rugby Union exhibition matches, Clay Target Shoot and Bowling competition.

Chandra's misconduct was the subject of a 2006 documentary by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). A libel trial in July 2015, concluded that the allegations of fraud against Chandra were truthful; he was ordered to pay $1.6 million to cover CBC's legal fees, and later that year was stripped of his membership in the Order of Canada. As of 2020, four of Chandra's research publications have been retracted, and one has been corrected. The Ontario Provincial Police have issued a warrant for Chandra's arrest, based upon a criminal charge of fraud exceeding $5,000 for having allegedly defrauded the Ontario Health Insurance Plan. Scientific fraud In the late 1980s, Chandra was hired by Ross Laboratories, US manufacturer of Isomil and Similac, to determine if their infant formulas could help babies avoid allergy problems; Nestlé (Good Start) and Mead Johnson had also contacted with Chandra for similar studies on their infant formulas. Chandra reported that the Nestlé and Mead Johnson formulas could protect infants from allergies, but the Ross formula could not, despite nearly identical ingredients in the three studied formulas. Marilyn Harvey, a nurse who recruited subjects for Chandra's studies and who disputed the accuracy of the number of infants reportedly enrolled in those studies, stated, \\"[Chandra] had all of the data analyzed and published even before we had [...] the data collected.\\" In explaining his suspicious results to Mark Masor, then clinical research associate for Ross Pharmaceuticals, Chandra allegedly stated that \\"the study really wasn't designed right,\\" although he had designed the studies himself, and he also claimed \\"you didn't really pay me enough money to do it correctly.\\" In 1994, Memorial University, at which Chandra was a professor, investigated him for research fraud but its findings were kept private.White, Caroline. BMJ : British Medical Journal (Online); London351 (Nov 17, 2015). BMJ 2015;351:h6211 In 2001, a study by Chandra and published in the journal Nutrition claimed that his own, patented multivitamin mineral supplement - the rights to which had been licensed to Javaan Corporation, a company founded by his daughter Amrita Chandra Gagnon - could reverse memory problems in people over the age of 65. The same study had earlier been submitted to, and rejected by, the British Medical Journal (BMJ), following a review by an expert who reported that the study had \\"all the hallmarks of being entirely invented.\\" In response to questions raised about the paper's validity, including questions of whether any of the reported work had actually been performed, Nutrition published an editorial that stated, \\"We regret that our peer review process failed to identify these problems before publication.\\" Officials at Memorial University, where Chandra had been a faculty member and where the study was allegedly conducted, were requested to investigate but did not, stating that the combination of Chandra's retirement, his having left the country, and his claim that all the raw data had been lost during an office move prevented an investigation. In 2005 the paper was retracted. In 2002, \\"Amrit L. Jain\\", allegedly a pseudonym of Chandra's, published a study in Nutrition Research that confirmed Chandra's earlier results on the effects of vitamin ingestion upon respiratory illness. Jain, who claimed affiliation with the non-existent Medical Clinic and Nursing Home, Jaipur, India, used as a mailing address a rented post office box in Canada. Attempts to verify Jain's identity or existence have been unsuccessful, and in 2016 the Jain paper was retracted. Although Chandra retired from Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) under a cloud of suspicion, university officials did not charge him with research fraud. At least one university administrator admitted that Chandra's allegations of bias and threats of a lawsuit led to the termination of the university's investigation. Marilyn Harvey would later enter into legal proceedings against Memorial University, claiming that the lack of action by MUN against Chandra caused people to erroneously believe that her allegations against Chandra were unfounded. In response to the scandal, Memorial University later created the \\"Marilyn Harvey Award to Recognize the Importance of Research Ethics.\\" In 2015, Chandra filed a lawsuit against the CBC seeking damages for libel in relation to a news segment entitled \\"The Secret Life of Dr. Chandra,\\" which detailed many of the allegations of scientific and medical fraud (see below) against Chandra. The Ontario Superior Court ruled that the CBC's defence, based upon fair comment and responsible journalism, were allowed to go to the jury. The jury found that the substance of the CBC broadcast was true, and dismissed Chandra's claim that in preparing the program the CBC had invaded his privacy. The court also ordered Chandra to pay $1.6 million to cover the CBC's legal fees. The presiding judge, Justice Graeme Mew, wrote in the opinion of the court: \\"Tactically, Dr. Chandra played a high stakes game. The phrase, 'live by the sword, die by the sword' comes to mind. In the end, he failed abjectly.\\"Chandra v CBC, 2015 ONSC 5303 (CanLII), , retrieved on 2017-06-23 Chandra had been appointed in 1989 as an Officer in the Order of Canada. His membership in the Order of Canada was terminated on December 3, 2015.  Investigation by College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario  Chandra is listed in the official directory of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) with a revocation of registration effective 18 June 2018. The Discipline Committee of the CPSO investigated allegations of fraud against Chandra, and found that he engaged in a multi-year scheme to defraud the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) of over $2 million. College prosecutor Elisabeth Widner said, \\"[Chandra] targeted OHIP in a calculated fraud in which he used and induced patients and staff members by furnishing them with money and cheques for improper use in a billing scheme ... There was little to no medical services provided for the $2 million-plus...\\" The Committee report stated that Chandra's actions could be \\"reasonably [...] regarded by members as disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional.\\" Along with revocation of Chandra's certificate of registration, the Committee ordered Chandra to pay over $51,000 in fines and College costs.

The station airs a hot adult contemporary format branded on-air as 104.3 Fresh Radio. The station is owned by Corus Entertainment, which also owns CFMK-FM and CKWS-DT. History The station was launched in 1942 as CKWS, a CBC Trans-Canada Network affiliate taking over CBC responsibilities from Queen's University radio station CFRC. When CKLC launched, it became affiliated with the CBC's Dominion Network. Broadcasting on 960 AM, CKWS was owned by Allied Broadcasting, a partnership of Roy Thomson and Rupert Davies, owner of the Kingston Whig-Standard newspaper. The call letters were derived from the newspaper's name, as was common at the time. FM sister station CKWS- FM (now CFMK-FM) signed on in 1947 (originally as CKWR-FM), and CKWS-TV launched in 1954. For most of the 1960s and 1970s, CKWS battled local rival CKLC for listenership, since both stations had adopted a similar Top 40 music format, although CKWS always carried more news and community programming. The stations were purchased by Paul Desmarais and Claude Pratte in 1977. CKWS disaffiliated from CBC Radio in 1978 with the opening of CBCK-FM. In 1982, the station would move to new studios on Counter Street. In 1987 the station became part of Desmarais' Power Corporation and adopted the call letters CFFX, as it would no longer be associated with the television station, which retained the CKWS name. At the same time, CFMK-FM relocated its studios to the Counter Street location. The stations were subsequently sold to their current owner, Corus Entertainment, in 2000,Decision CRTC 2000-87 , Acquisition of assets, CRTC, March 24, 2000 at which time they were \\"reunited\\" with the television station and moved back to the studios on Queen Street. On February 14, 2005, the CRTC denied an application by 591989 B.C. Ltd., a subsidiary of Corus Entertainment Inc. to operate a low-power FM transmitter in Kingston. The proposed transmitter would operate at 93.7 MHz with an effective radiated power of 50 watts. The applicant indicated that approval of its proposal would improve the quality of CFFX's signal in Kingston's downtown core. Corus stated that in the central core area of Kingston, the CFFX signal dropped significantly in volume and that it was weak, or very weak, in shopping centres. The licensee further stated that while both AM and FM signals would experience signal degradation in downtown areas, AM signals were significantly more susceptible to electrical noise and interference from computers and similar devices. Corus stated, with respect to the use of the FM spectrum, that it had evaluated the availability of low-power FM frequencies, and found that numerous channels of that type were available for use in Kingston.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2005-50, CFFX Kingston - Technical change, CRTC, February 14, 2005 =Conversion to FM and format changes= As of 2007, CFFX was carrying an oldies format. In April 2007, CFFX applied to move to FM, and was given approval by the CRTC on August 28, 2007.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-334, Conversions to FM band and licensing of a new radio station to serve Kingston, CRTC, August 28, 2007 In September, CFFX began testing at 104.3 FM playing a wide variety of different music formats. On October 15, 2007, CFFX moved from 960 AM to 104.3 FM, adopting an adult contemporary music format as Lite 104.3. Because of CRTC regulations, oldies was not yet allowed on FM radio, necessitating a change of formats. At midnight on the evening of January 14, 2008, the AM frequency began a final test of their equipment using their 10,000 watt daytime directional antenna. At the top of each hour, on both AM and FM stations, a special announcement was broadcast, followed by special test material, including morse code and sweep tones. This lasted for several minutes before returning to regular programming. This test was repeated again at 1:00 AM and 2:00 AM. The 960 AM signal was turned off at 6:00 AM EST on January 15, 2008. On August 19, 2010, after the CRTC allowed oldies on FM radio, the station changed its format back to a classic hits format, as well as changing its call sign to CKWS-FM, regaining the CKWS calls it lost back in 1987 as an AM station. On February 24, 2014, the station flipped back to adult contemporary as Hits 104.3. On February 13, 2015, the station rebranded to 104.3 Fresh Radio and changed its format to hot adult contemporary.Fresh Radio makes debut on Kingston airwaves, CKWS-TV, February 13, 2015 References External links * 104.3 Fresh Radio Kws Kws Kws Category:Radio stations established in 1942 Category:1942 establishments in Ontario ","title":"CKWS-FM"},{"id":"3918266","text":"\\"Drinking the Kool-Aid\\" is the ninth episode of the first season of the American mystery television series Veronica Mars. The episode's teleplay was written by Russell Smith, from a story by series creator Rob Thomas, and was directed by Marcos Siega, the episode premiered on UPN on November 30, 2004. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica investigates the mysterious cult of which Casey, another student, is part, the Moon Calf Collective. Meanwhile, Veronica deals with the aftermath of the realization that Jake Kane (Kyle Secor) is likely her biological father.  Synopsis  Picking up from where the events of the last episode left off, Veronica muses about Jake Kane possibly being her father. Veronica looks at the photos that a mysterious person took of her, and she believes that Jake Kane took the photos. Eventually, Veronica finds out that a man named Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan) took the photos of her. She follows him to the Kane business building, where she finds that he's the head of security at the company. The next day, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) talks to a couple, who tell him about their son, Casey (Jonathan Bennett), who has joined a cult. Even though Veronica decries the boy as irresponsible, Veronica agrees to help with the case to help her father earn the $5,000 the case will be paying. Meanwhile, Veronica sends a DNA paternity test off in the mail. Veronica talks to Casey's ex-girlfriend, who tells him that Casey may be having an affair with an English teacher, Ms. Mills (Amy Laughlin). Veronica decides to write some poetry in order to \\"get into the lit-mag crowd\\". Later, Veronica talks to Ms. Mills, who tells her that she wants her to join the Moon Calf Collective, the cult of which Casey is part. At the Moon Calf Collective, we see Ms. Mills kissing another man. At the same time, a variety of people hit on Veronica, implying some sort of polygamy. Eventually, Veronica gets stuck with milking a cow, and begins talking to one of the younger members, Rain (Megalyn Echikunwoke) in order to get information. The woman tells Veronica that they are growing a major \\"cash crop\\". At a meeting, the other members ask for Veronica to read her poem, but she quickly leaves to enter the barn which was previously mentioned as forbidden. In there, she finds an aggressive horse. Casey invites her back to the cult, and she goes. Veronica goes on a walk with the cult leader, but also puts a record tape on in her bag. It turns out that the \\"ultimate cash crop\\" is flowers. However, Keith later goes undercover as a repairman into the compound and sees Veronica. Later, Keith and Veronica have a debate, which ends in Veronica being banned from the case. At that moment, Casey's parents return to Mars Investigations. They tell him that his brain dead grandmother has left him $80 million in her will and ask Keith to finish the case. The next day, Veronica talks to Wallace (Percy Daggs III), who tells her that she may be becoming sympathetic to the cult. Casey takes Veronica to the bed of his grandmother. On a carton of milk, Veronica sees a missing ad for Rain. Keith wants to investigate further against the Collective for the money, but Veronica disagrees with him. The next day, Veronica is about to tell Ms. Mills about her investigations before Casey bursts in saying that his grandmother has died. Later, at Casey's grandmother's funeral, Veronica sees Casey being kidnapped by his parents and a fringe psychologist. Keith tells Veronica that he has dropped the investigation, accepting that it is harmless. Keith also reports that Debbie Meyer (Rain) has had a difficult life and is better off with the cult. That night, Veronica receives the results of the DNA test. Veronica decides to shred the document before reading it.  Cultural references  A variety of pop culture references are made in the episode: *Keith says \\"Chicks dig scars,\\" a reference to the 2000 film The Replacements. *Veronica mentions that she used to want to marry Vanilla Ice and gather a massive collection of Zbots. *Wallace refers to the game Hacky Sack. *Veronica states that all she knows about rural life is from watching Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. *Keith compares the Moon Calf Collective to watching The Brady Bunch. *Veronica uses the word \\"Yahtzee!\\" as an expression of excitement.  Music  The following music can be heard in the episode: *\\"Make a Deal with the City\\" by East River Pipe *\\"Oh! Sweet Nuthin\\" by The Velvet Underground (sung around the campfire at the Moon Calf Collective) *\\"(You Gotta Walk) Don't Look Back\\" by Peter Tosh and Mick Jagger *\\"Have a Nice Day\\" by Stereophonics *\\"Famous Lover\\" by The Fire Marshals of Bethlehem  Production  Beginning with this episode, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, who portrayed Mallory Dent, is no longer credited in the opening credits. In addition, Jason Dohring, who plays Logan Echolls, does not appear in \\"Drinking the Kool-Aid.\\" The scars shown on actor Enrico Colantoni's face during the episode actually existed due to the actor playing ice hockey in real life. The episode's title refers to the phrase, \\"Drinking the Kool-Aid\\", which refers to uncritical obedience. The phrase has its origins in the 1978 Jonestown deaths, which killed 909 followers, many of whom were children, of the Peoples Temple cult, headed by Jim Jones. These followers, urged on by Jones, who termed it \\"revolutionary suicide,\\" killed themselves knowingly by drinking Flavor Aid laced with cyanide, although most of these followers did so under threat of worse violence or because they believed they had no choice.  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, the episode received 2.40 million viewers, ranking 101 of 108 in the weekly rankings and marking a significant drop in viewers. = Reviews = In a positive review, Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club wrote that \\"In tonight's episode, we get a cult, which is a TV staple of evil ever since the 1990s…Of course, here on Veronica Mars, the twist is that, like Meg, the happy cult is exactly what it appears to be.\\" Television Without Pity gave the episode a \\"B\\". However, some reviews were not so positive. Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, wrote in his verdict that \\"I was pretty uncomfortable with this episode's unsettling pro-cult stance.\\" But the reviewer also stated that \\"[he] appreciated the unexpected twist.\\" BuzzFeed ranked the episode third-to-last on its ranking of all Veronica Mars episodes, calling the episode \\"disappointing.\\"  References   External links  *\\"Drinking the Kool- Aid\\" at Mars Investigations Category:2004 American television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 1) episodes ","title":"Drinking the Kool-Aid (Veronica Mars)"},{"id":"3918277","text":"The shining honeycreeper (Cyanerpes lucidus) is a small bird in the tanager family. It is found in the tropical New World in Central America from southern Mexico to Panama and northwest Colombia. It is sometimes considered to be conspecific with the purple honeycreeper (C. caeruleus), but the two species breed sympatrically in eastern Panama and northwest Colombia. This is a forest canopy species, but also occurs in forest edges and secondary growth. The female builds a shallow cup nest in a tree, and incubates the clutch of two eggs. The shining honeycreeper is 10 cm long, weighs 11 g and has a long black decurved bill. The male is purple-blue with black wings, tail and throat, and bright yellow legs. The female has green upperparts, a greenish-blue head, buff throat and buff-streaked bluish underparts. The immature is similar to the female, but is greener on the head and breast. The call of this honeycreeper is a thin high-pitched seee, and the male's song is a pit pit pit pit pit-pit repeated for minutes at a time. This species is very similar to the purple honeycreeper, but the male of the latter species is overall slightly darker and its black throat patch is smaller. Unlike the female shining honeycreeper, the female purple honeycreeper has buff (not dusky) lores and, except for its malar, no clear blue tinge to the head. The shining honeycreeper is easily distinguished from the larger red-legged honeycreeper with which its shares its range by the latter species’ red legs and, in the male, black mantle. The shining honeycreeper is usually found in pairs or family groups. It feeds on nectar, berries and insects, mainly in the canopy. It responds readily to the call of the ferruginous pygmy owl.

Formed in Kevin Azzouz's condominium apartment just before the heyday of technology company mergers and acquisitions during the 1990s, the original Quest operation became part of Astora Software, Arcada Software, Seagate Software, VERITAS Software and Symantec. The operation continued to develop data-protection software in San Luis Obispo until April, 2008, when Symantec finally closed the siteSymantec To Close San Luis Obispo Office, KSBY TV news story and relocated most of its remaining personnel to their Orem (UT), Mountain View (CA) and Heathrow (FL) facilities. A small fragment of the original backup software operation remains in San Luis Obispo at Sonic Solutions, located just down the street from the now-defunct site. Sonic acquired the Desktop and Mobile Division from VERITAS in November, 2002.SEC Form 8-K Filing, dated 20 November 2002 Quest's founder Kevin Azzouz, was president, and Lennart Mengwall, his mentor and long-time business partner was chairman. Symantec initially contracted with Quest to develop Norton Backup for MS-DOS and then for Microsoft Windows. Quest retained exclusive ownership of all source code it developed, while Symantec retained exclusive marketing rights over the software. To provide a backup solution for the Norton Utilities for Macintosh suite, Quest acquired FastBack for Macintosh from Fifth Generation Systems, bringing its principal author, Tom Chappell, into the company as well. The relationship between Fifth Generation Systems and the principals of Quest was not always harmonious; it spawned litigation with Quest prevailing after the discovery process led to dismissal by the court. In January 1993, Quest paid Symantec to terminate their development contract, then immediately licensed their backup software to several tape- drive vendors, a step that generated a substantial amount of revenue. These funds allowed Azzouz and Mengwall to position the company for a merger, in spite of severe restrictions that Symantec had placed on Quest as part of their separation agreement. Although Symantec had produced a long list of specifically named companies that were effectively taken off the table as merger partners, company leaders at Symantec led by Enrique Salem failed to see the potential competition from a hardware company such as Conner Peripherals, and so Azzouz and Mengwall were able to arrange a merger between Quest and the Conner software division, Conner Software of Lake Mary, Florida, the producer of Backup Exec, to form Arcada Software. Astora Software was the name given to the transitional company that was formed after Quest bought out its development contract with Symantec, but before the founding of its successor company, Arcada. It was in existence for only a two-week period during 1994. Mengwall was bought out during the merger and was not kept on as a principal of Arcada Software. Azzouz became president of Arcada Software.

Townsend attended Dripping Springs High School in Dripping Springs, Texas where he graduated in 2001. He played for coach Tom Hancock while at Dripping Springs. After his junior season of high school he was offered a scholarship to play baseball at Rice University. After college, Townsend was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles with the eighth pick of the 2004 Draft, but was ruled ineligible to continue negotiation with the Orioles while remaining at Rice to finish his degree. He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' with the eighth pick of 2005 Draft, signing for a $1.5 million bonus. College career Townsend spent his first season as a reliever for Rice, which went to the College World Series and finished second in the nation in ERA. Townsend was 2–1 with a 2.28 ERA and six saves as a freshman, recording 51 strikeouts, 22 walks, and 10 wild pitches in 51.1 innings. As a sophomore in 2003, he struggled with his control in his first appearance but came into his own as a weekday starter, pitching Rice's non- conference games against rival Houston and Big 12 opponents. He finished the season 11–2 with a 2.20 ERA, beating defending national champion Texas twice, including once in the CWS, Houston three times, and single wins over Nebraska, Baylor, and Texas A&M.; The consensus all-American also recorded five saves as a reliever, mostly in Western Athletic Conference games, and led the WAC with a school-record 164 strikeouts (broken by Eddie Degerman in 2006). In 2003, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and received the league's Outstanding Pro Prospect award. Rice's most consistent starter in 2004, Townsend finished 12–0 with a 1.80 ERA and two saves. Against San Jose State April 17, he came four outs away from a no-hitter. Townsend, Philip Humber, and Jeff Niemann were all selected in the first eight picks of the 2004 draft – the first time three teammates had ever gone so early in the same draft. Townsend and the Orioles, however, did not agree to contract terms. He hired an agent, thereby renouncing his collegiate eligibility, and enrolled at Rice to complete his degree in his seventh semester. Major League Baseball, however, ruled that Townsend's return to school terminated the Orioles' right to negotiate a contract. He re-entered the draft in 2005 and was again taken eighth overall, this time by the Devil Rays.Former Rice pitcher taken No. 8 in First-Year draft Professional career Townsend's professional debut came at Class A Short-Season Hudson Valley, . He finished the season 0–4 with a 5.49 ERA in 12 appearances, including 10 starts. He pitched in the Arizona Fall League in the 2005 off season. In fall of 2005 Townsend underwent Tommy John surgery on his elbow. In fall 2008, Townsend was again sent to the Arizona Fall League, where he lasted only innings and gave up 12 runs before he was sidelined with shoulder problems. Townsend underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum and ended up in rehab for most of the 2010 season. After an atrocious half-season in the independent leagues, Townsend retired in late 2010. Poker career Townsend began playing poker professionally while at Rice University in the fall of 2004, after turning down a $2.2 million signing bonus from the Baltimore Orioles in order to finish his degree.

It was first surveyed in and was named after Robert Sinclair Gurd, a businessman and one-time mayor of Sarnia. In 1970, Gurd was annexed by the incorporated (Township municipality of) Nipissing. The township was shaped like an \\"L\\" wrapping around Nipissing. It was bounded on the north and northwest by Patterson Township on the west by Pringle Township, on the east and northeast by Nipissing, on the east by South Himsworth Township and on the south by Machar Township. It included the community of Hotham and part of Commanda. When it was annexed, Gurd had a population of 260 while Nipissing had 550. Today, the population is approximately 300 (419 including the nearby community of Alsace). Gurd is home to the Bray Lake Conservation Reserve, South River Forest Provincial Conservation Reserve and the John P. Webster Nature Preserve.

Historic schools The PSUSD used to have 5 other public schools in Palm Springs and one other in Cathedral City. Until the 1950s, the PSUSD had separate school campuses for African-American, Latino, Asian-American and American Indian students when school segregation was then legal, then came the mandated policy of racial integration affected local schools. They were the El Camino, Harry Oliver, Mount San Jacinto and Palm Valley schools in the Section 14 neighborhood, inside the Agua Caliente Indian Reservation. Local celebrities and billionaires like Walter Annenberg and Frank Sinatra boosted public schools in the city and desert, whom also personally fought against racial and ethnic segregation of public schools. At the time, even American Jewish and American Catholic students would choose church-run and religious day schools over public ones, until the end of WWII when their parents were comfortable sending them to secular public schools. By the start of the 1960s, the PSUSD was integrated of all races and creeds. The (later private) Palm Valley School in the 1920s on the city limits of Cathedral City, closed and moved to current site in the 1960s. The Smoke Tree school which faced the Walt Disney ranch and the Bob Hope and Elvis Presley residences closed in the 1960s. The Frances Stevens school now the Palm Springs Theatre. The Harry Oliver school became the Palm Springs Community School run by Riverside County Department of Education. The Ramon School now the St. Theresa's Catholic school. The relocated El Camino Continuation High School, on Demuth Park (the park and school's original site was on west Ramon and south Palm Canyon Dr.) in the late 1970s, on the PSHS site in the early 1980s, then became the Esperanza High School for teenage mothers in 1986, then closed in the early 1990s. And the Mount San Jacinto School, later a special- day studies school on Section 14, the land parcel on the Agua Caliente Indian reservation, also where El Camino was.

Delany, published by Bamberger Books. It was reissued by Wesleyan University Press in 2013. Phallos takes the form of a modern online essay recounting the history and giving a synopsis of a nonexistent novel also called Phallos, set in the Mediterranean during the reign of Roman Emperor Hadrian. Plot summary As Delany's Nevèrÿon series, Phallos uses a frame story — a double frame, in fact. The first is a brief trio of paragraphs telling of a young man, Adrian Rome, whose adolescent encounter with the book leads to his adult attempt, a decade later, to acquire a copy: and how he settles for an on-line synopsis posted by one Randy Pedarson of Moscow, Idaho. The second frame is more complex: it concerns the fictive editor Randy Pedarson, presumably of Moscow, and his relations with two graduate students, Binky and Phyllis, also enthusiasts of the novel, at the university there. According to Pedarson's posting, as far as Pedarson can tell, an anonymous gay pornographic novel, Phallos (one of Pederson's three favorites: the other two are John Preston's Mr. Benson and William Talsman’s The Gaudy Image — both of which are known for their better-than- average writing), was published in 1969 by Essex House of West Hollywood, California. While the anonymous introduction to that volume suggests that Phallos was known to numerous literary gay men of the past, from the 18th century advocate of Greek beauty, Johanne Joaquim Winkelmann, through the 19th century Oxford aesthetician and novelist Walter Pater, to the historian John Addington Symonds (whose seven-volume The Renaissance in Italy [1875-86] acted as a sort of counterbalance to Pater’s brief single volume [of 1873/75], The Renaissance, still widely read and quoted today), and moving on to such characters as Baron Corvo (pseudonym of Frederick Rolfe) and sex researcher Havelock Ellis, Pederson concludes that all this is simply the kind of bogus folderol that accompanies so much of the pornography published in that licentious decade, as an attempt to legitimize it. Pederson goes on to synopsize Phallos — during which synopsis, now and again, he quotes from it more or less liberally. That synopsis, along with the footnotes — some of them as extensive as five or six pages — provided by his friends, recent Ph.D.'s Binky and Phyllis, make up the text of Delany's novella. =Fictional novel= Phallos proper begins with a Greek epigraph — the \\"Anaximander fragment,\\" presumably the oldest piece of written Greek philosophy extant from the Ionian presocratics, dating from the last years of the 6th century BCE. This is glossed by a footnote from Binky, who, in four pages, gives his version of Nietzsche's, Hegel's, Heidegger's, and finally Sir Karl Popper's take on Anaximander, with a few potshots by Phyllis (virtually footnotes to the footnote). Pederson reproduces Phallos’s whole first chapter. It serves as a prologue to the novel proper as well as to his own synopsis. Also, it introduces us to our narrator, Neoptolomus, the son of a gentleman farmer on the island of Syracuse in Sicily who reads Heraclietos and can recite some of Aesop’s fables in Greek. His mother is a one-time Egyptian slave woman, freed long ago. When his parents are killed by a fever in his 17th year, Neoptolomus comes under the protection of a rich Roman merchant who keeps a summer villa in the area. The rich Roman takes young Neoptolomus to Rome and sponsors him as an officer in the Roman army and, on his release, asks him, in return, to travel to Egypt and help him acquire some lands across the Nile from the city of Hermopolis. The Roman Emperor Hadrian is visiting Hermopolis at the time, and Neoptolomus becomes involved with the murder of the emperor’s favorite, Antinous. At the temple of \\"a nameless god,\\" whose priests control the lands across the river at Hir-wer, Neoptolomus learns that on the day of Antinous's death, bandits have broken into the temple and, from the statue of the god, stolen the \\"golden phallos, encrusted with jade, copper, and jewels\\" — phallos is Greek for the male member. This theft has thrown the whole religious system into chaos. Almost immediately Neoptolomus finds himself kidnapped by a bandit gang, whose leader is certainly the man who killed Antinous. The first third of the novella deals with Neoptolomus, his relation with the bandit chief, and the period before and after the bandit sells him to a scholar in Alexandria. The plot is interlarded — indeed, held together — by numerous gay sexual encounters. While Pederson mentions them, his synopsis omits much — indeed, most — of the explicit sexual description. After several years of the hero's wanderings, the novel's middle third finds Neoptolomus back in Rome. Once more he is working for his Roman patron, now as a broker of warehouse space in his patron's several Roman warehouses. After his early education in the sex life of the desert and the barbarian outlands, Neoptolomus finds himself sampling the intricacies of civilized urban sex — as well as negotiating the complexities that arise for him as a gay man trying to have friendships with — and work among — straight men. His several attempts to retrieve the phallos are shown, from Rome to Byzantium, back to Syracuse, and even to the volcanic slopes of Mt. Etna. The central third include a drugged Walpurgisnacht among the volcanic peaks and the sad history of a Roman street boy, Maximin, who Neoptolomus wrongly decides is trying to steal from him, though in reality he has been the victim of one of Neoptolomus's jealous lovers. In the final third, years later an older and wiser Neoptolomus returns to Hermopolis, where he meets a young black African, Nivek, sent to the Temple of the nameless god, much as Neoptolomus had been, also to acquire rights to the land across the Nile at Hir-wer — which, since Antinous's death, Hadrian has transformed into the city of Antinoöpolis, now a shrine to the memory of the emperor's late lover, who has officially been declared a god. Here history would seem to repeat itself, only Neoptolomus is in a different role from the one he occupied as a youth. Through this switch in position, Neoptolomus comes to understand a great deal about some of the mysteries around his earlier visit to Hermopolis. Soon, under the pleasures of his committed life-partnership with Nivek, Neoptolomus gives up his search for the phallos. Because of his success both in business and in life — and because they know how much energy in the past Neoptolomus has put into searching for the phallos — many of the couple's friends, however, including a poet, a Christian priest, and a horse- loving adventurer, assume the two, now successful merchants on their own, have secretly found it. Their friends cleave to them in the hopes that they will learn more of the phallos and can perhaps share in its power. Nivek and Neoptolomus run into problems holding their annual orgies in their own summer villa in the Apennines above Rome — sometimes with their neighbors, sometimes with their guests. Though Neoptolomus and Nivek have given up the search for the phallos, because of their friends’ interest in that object they are almost as greatly plagued by its possible existence — or non-existence — as they were before. The novel concludes when Neoptolomus's rich Roman patron dies, and Neoptolomus and Nivek return to Syracuse to take over Neoptolmus's late father's lands, using some of the money that his patron has left him. Meanwhile, Neoptolomus has generously sponsored a young goatherd, Cronin, with a commission in the army, as Neoptolomus himself had been sponsored in his youth; and Nivek has just invited a sexually interesting farm worker, Aronk, to come and work for them — because he realizes that Neoptolomus finds him attractive. In a scene in which the two men embrace in an acceptance of the cyclic, yet unpredictable, nature of life, the novel proper ends. The commentary from the triptych of the editor and his friends, however, goes on. In another footnote Binky points out Pederson's tendency in his synopsis to downplay any racial tensions dramatized in the book. Phyllis has the last say, pointing out in her final note an equally misogynistic streak in Pederson's selection of the materials he has included (and, even more so, left out), so that the final word we read in the text is her accusation against Pedarson of subjecting his version of the book to a certain order of \\"castration\\". Publication history The original 2004 edition of Phallos was published by small press Bamberger Books. The 2013 \\"enhanced and revised edition,\\" published by Wesleyan University Press, was edited by Robert Reid-Pharr and includes scholarly essays by the editor, Steven Shaviro, Kenneth James, and Darieck Scott.

Written by Diane Ruggiero and directed by Nick Marck, the episode premiered on UPN on December 14, 2004. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica investigates when someone steals Logan's (Jason Dohring) money at a poker game. Meanwhile, Keith investigates a mysterious person who is stalking Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin). Despite ranking low in the ratings and marking a season low in terms of number of viewers, the episode was critically lauded.  Synopsis  Veronica and Keith decorate their Christmas tree. Meanwhile, Duncan (Teddy Dunn) dances around drunkenly at a poker party with Logan, Weevil (Francis Capra), and two others, Sean (Kevin Sheridan) and Connor (Travis Schuldt). Weevil wins $5,000 from Logan when they both go all in. However, when Logan opens his money box, he finds that the money is missing. Weevil grows angry and asks each of the other members for $1,000. The next day at school, Duncan confronts Weevil, who stole his laptop. Veronica approaches him, and Duncan tells her about his problem. Duncan tells Veronica that his computer contains some private information regarding their past relationship. Veronica asks Weevil for the computer back, but he refuses. Weevil explains why he was at the card game and says that Logan had an opportunity to hide the money during the game. Logan's mother, Lynn (Lisa Rinna), visits Keith and tells him about threatening letters that a mysterious person sent to her husband. Later, Veronica talks to Duncan, who gives his side of the story. Duncan also blames Logan. Later, Duncan confronts Logan about stealing the money, but he refuses to give any details. When Keith visits the Echolls' house, he finds a pumpkin outside their front door with Aaron's face on it and a knife through it. Veronica stops by the Echolls' house and talks to Logan, and he says that he thinks that Connor stole the money. Veronica visits Connor's movie set, and she questions him about the poker game. However, he does not know who could have stolen the money. Veronica attempts to visit Sean, but his father turns her away. After deducing that the pumpkin probably has something to do with a halloween encounter or incident, Keith goes to the caterer of the party Aaron was at that day. The caterer tells him that Aaron was having an affair at that party. The next day, Veronica talks to Sean, who tells her that he thinks that Weevil stole the money. Keith talks to Aaron, who admits to the affair and says that it was with his agent's wife, Monica Hadwin (Emmanuelle Vaugier). Veronica frets about Duncan's diary before Veronica comes up and makes a deal with Logan: He will host another poker game so Veronica can determine who the thief is. At the poker game, Veronica reveals her findings: Duncan was faking being drunk in order to win the money, not steal it, Connor was simply using a muscle enhancer, and Logan is not the thief because his room was messy (and Veronica figures that if he hid the money, he wouldn't tear apart his room looking for it. Veronica figures out that Sean is the criminal, not Weevil. Sean stuffed the money into the recycling and picked it up the next morning. Sean and Weevil go off by themselves, presumably so Weevil can punish him. Keith talks to the caterer again and asks her to describe the woman she fired. The poker guests then go to Aaron Echolls' party. Veronica, off by herself, finds Jake Kane and confronts him about the pictures of her taken by his security chief, Clarence Wiedman. Jake screams at her that he doesn't know, and Keith views the scene. Jake then angrily talks to his wife, Celeste (Lisa Thornhill), who actually sent Clarence to take the pictures. The majority of the guests go outside to sing Christmas carols while Aaron is confronted by his stalker, the woman whom the caterer fired. The stalker stabs Aaron, but the other guests do not notice because they aren't there. Keith tackles the stalker, and Lynn calls for an ambulance as Logan looks on, ending the episode on a cliffhanger.  Arc significance  *Veronica confronts Jake Kane at the party about the surveillance photos sent to her mom. Jake denies knowing about them, but leaves while grabbing Celeste and saying, \\"What did you do?\\" to her. *Aaron Echolls is stabbed by a jealous former lover, which results in his wife learning of her husband's infidelity with other women.  Music  In addition to the series' theme song, \\"We Used to Be Friends\\", by The Dandy Warhols, the following music can be heard in the episode: *\\"Little Bit More\\" by Tony C. and The Truth *\\"Slow Hands\\" by Interpol *\\"Saturday Night\\" by Ozomatli *\\"Camp-Fire\\" by Starling Electric *\\"Little Drummer Boy\\" by The Dandy Warhols  Production  The episode was written by Diane Ruggiero and directed by Nick Marck. \\"An Echolls Family Christmas\\" marks Ruggiero's third writing credit for the series (after \\"The Wrath of Con\\" and \\"The Girl Next Door\\").

Also, recurring characters Aaron and Lynn Echolls as well as Jake and Celeste Kane appear in the episode after not appearing for several episodes. Some fans of the show cite this episode as one of the best episodes of the series as a whole. This (and the following episode) are the only episodes of the series to be aired out of production order. The following episode, \\"Silence of the Lamb\\" was produced before this episode, but was aired after, due to \\"An Echolls Family Christmas\\" being a Christmas-themed episode which aired as season's final episode of the year in December 2004.  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, \\"An Echolls Family Christmas\\" received 1.90 million viewers, ranking 109th of 111 in the weekly rankings. This episode is the lowest-rated episode of the first season. = Reviews = The episode was critically acclaimed. In a glowing review, Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, stated that \\"this episode works at every level: it's tense, it's funny, it's light, it's dark, it stands alone, it builds up the plot, it's plausible, and it's surprising.\\" The reviewer also wrote that \\"It also allows for some wonderful bits of dramatic irony.\\" He also praised the poker game, the guest stars, Keith's storyline, and the episode's Christmas feel. Television Without Pity gave the episode an \\"A+,\\" its first such rating for the series. Price Peterson of TV.com also gave a positive review.

He was tortured by at least four fellow soldiers and a sergeant on December 31, 2005. This case caused public opinion in Russia and especially NGOs like the Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia (CSMR) to blame the current administration, in particular Defense Minister Sergey Ivanov, for tolerating the practice of dedovshchina, an organized system of hazing, inside the military ranks. On December 31, 2005, Sychyov and another seven soldiers were beaten for three hours by their seniors. Sychyov, then aged 19, was forced to squat for four hours with his hands tied behind his back while a sergeant beat him. On January 4, Sychyov attempted to receive medical attention, but his request was rejected by higher-rank officers. Only a few days later, due to the worsening of his health, he was transferred to the city hospital, where he was diagnosed with numerous broken bones, trauma to the genital area and gangrene of the legs. There are allegations that the military attempted to keep the case from the media and ordered the doctors to keep silent; however, one of the doctors treating Sychyov contacted Lyudmila Zinchenko, the president of the Committee of Soldier's Mothers, which, in turn, contacted Sychyov's mother, Galina Pavlovna Sychyova. Sychyov's mother's last contact with her son was on January 3, when she called to congratulate him on the New Year. On the phone, he told her that he was not doing well and was about to be taken to a hospital. Once she received the news of the transfer, she attempted to contact her son at the hospital but was told that, due to the holidays, nobody would attend to her son until January 10. On January 7, however, she was contacted by a surgeon who told her to come quickly, as her son might not survive until the next day. As a result of gangrene in the legs, which is a reduced blood flow, and lack of timely medical attention, doctors had to amputate both his legs, genitalia, and a finger. Junior Sergeant Alexander Sivyakov, also a conscript, was found guilty of the torture and was sentenced to four years in prison, along with an additional three-year ban from the army and loss of military rank. Pavel Kuzmenko and Gennady Bilimovich were also found guilty and sentenced to one year's probationary sentence. When questioned, the Defense Minister disregarded these claims at first, but was forced to take action shortly thereafter. Allegations appeared in the media during the trial, claiming that an FSB agent unsuccessfully tried to bribe the mother of Andrey Sychyov to drop the case in return for monetary assistance. In September 2007 it was reported that Andrey Sychyov tried to be included in the party election list of the Union of Rightist Forces (SPS), for the State Duma elections.

It is near Port Harcourt. Ferries are the main form of transport to and from the island. The local language spoken on Bonny Island is Ibani. Many natives also speak the Igbo language. History Located at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean on the Bight of Bonny, the island of Bonny serves as the seat of a traditional state known as the Kingdom of Bonny. Bonny was founded by a priest king known as Ndoli. He (as well as his successors Opuamakuba and Alagbariye) were the leaders of the founding group of Bonny Island. The virgin lands and territories of the island kingdom were settled about or before 1400AD. Asimini, the fourth king (but the first one to be crowned), founded a dynasty that went on to provide most of the kingdom's monarchs. =Founding myth= It is believed today that the founders of the island kingdom were originally from within the Isedani lineage of Kolokuma in the Ebeni-toru region (in the present day Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area of Bayelsa State). They were led to the new site by four direct descendants of Ebeni. These were Ndoli, Opuamakuba, Alagbariye and Asimini. Upon their arrival in Bonny, the four ruled the new settlement that they established there in turn. From these leaders and the entire founding generation of the kingdom evolved the lineage/ward/house system of governance that the kingdom is currently organized into. Structure of the kingdom The \\"Amanyanabo\\", or monarch (lit. owner of the land), presides over a chieftaincy system composed of \\"Ase-Alapu\\" (or high chiefs of royal blood) and \\"Amadapu\\" (or district heads). All of the former serve as members of the Bonny Chiefs' Council, the amanyanabo's privy council. Bonny Island has five Duawaris (lit. ancestral royal houses). All represent the founding generation of its kingdom. These are: (i) The Bristol-Alagbariye House, (ii) The Halliday-Awusa House, (iii) The Dublin Green House (Lala, Ebie, Asimini-Oruakpa lineages), (iv) The Oruasawo Tolofari House (Kumaluya-Ndende, Omuigbem lineages), and (v) The Buoye-Omuso Brown House The different houses are known for having individual ancestral headquarters. The early descendants of the Kongo lineage, for example, established Ikpapkayo (or, as it's known today, Finima). Notable events Bonny Island was a hotbed of economic activity right from the 15th century. The Portuguese arrived at this time, and the island kingdom subsequently established good relations with them. It sent its first ambassador, Prince Abagy, to Portugal in about 1450AD. In the 19th Century AD, Bonny Island accepted Christianity through the ministry of Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther. Prior to this event, the totem of the kingdom had been the iguana. It was also in that century that a civil war was fought between those loyal to Chief Oko Jumbo of the Manilla Pepple house and those loyal to Chief Jaja of the Anne Pepple house. This war eventually led to the establishment of the Kingdom of Opobo. Bonny today With a thriving traditional system and robust cultural heritage, Bonny stands out as one of Nigeria's most vibrant communities. Her traditional institution is headed by King Edward William Dappa Pepple, Perekule XI, who serves as amanyanabo and natural ruler. The Chiefs' Council is led by Chief Reginald Abbey-Hart, who is the high chief and head of Captain Hart house. Each high chief independently rules his house because the chiefs' council is traditionally seen as a commonwealth of independent nations that came together for the sole purpose of protecting the kingdom as a whole. The community is subdivided into two main segments – the mainland and the hinterland. The mainland comprises Bonny Island and its segments, namely the Main Island (Township), Sandfield, Iwoama, Orosikiri, Aganya, Ayambo, Akiama, Workers Camp, and some outlying fishing settlements lying along the Bonny River’s coastline. The hinterland includes the village communities such as Kuruma, Ayama, Kalaibiama and Oloma. Presently, the Kingdom of Bonny has thirty five chieftaincy houses. These are fourteen major chieftaincy houses (five among which are Duawaris); twenty minor chieftaincy houses; and then the George Pepple lineage of the Perekule royal house that has recently been producing kings of the kingdom. The ancestry of the Perekule royal house may be traced to the Duawaris themselves. It was the founding generation of Bonny that established the kingdom's civilisation and commonwealth. All the chieftaincy houses, and the people that belong to them, derive their authority in Bonny from their descent from its founders. Economy In the early 1990s the Federal Government of Nigeria, in collaboration with 3 international partners, Shell Gas BV., CLEAG Limited [ELF] and AGIP International BV. started the multibillion-dollar project Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Limited (Nigeria LNG).Home - Nigeria LNG Due to its strategic position, Bonny Island, particularly the Finima community area along Bonny Island, is hosting various multinational oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell, Mobil, Chevron, Agip, and Elf. Education Public and private secondary schools on the island include: * Bonny National Grammar School * Spring Foundation Group of Schools * St.Paul's Comprehensive College * Government Girls Secondary School * Community Secondary School * Lucille Education Center * Kingdom Heritage * King and Queen school * RA International School Tourist attractions Bonny Island is surrounded on the west and south by long stretches of beaches. The beautiful beaches attract tourists and fun seeking inhabitants alike on sunny days and festive periods like Christmas and Easter. On 26 and 31 December of every year, thousands of people visit the Finima beaches for beach carnivals. There is also the Finima Nature Park, which is an important tourist area located at the right-hand side of the roundabout.

It was formed by Isaac N. Carleton in 1866, originally located in Medford. It was relocated to Bradford in 1884. The school continued teaching until about 1901. The facilities still exist in Bradford, operating as an apartment. Facilities Reception Room Dining Room The Medford location was five miles from Boston, reported to be near two railroads and street car service. The house was originally built in South Malden and relocated to Medford. In Bradford, the school was located in a home above the Bradford common, across the street from Bradford Academy. The Western division of the Boston and Maine Railroad provided transportation to Bradford at the time. Carleton added an additional building to the complex. Up to 15 students were boarded at the school. The first floor of the main building included a reception room, sitting room, and dining room. The school building included a main school room, two class rooms, laboratory, gym, and bowling alley. Instruction College preparatory instruction included Latin, Greek, French, German, Mathematics, Book keeping, Natural Sciences, English Literature and History. Younger children were educated in elementary English, reading, spelling, writing, geography, arithmetic and composition. Endorsements Bowling Alley Carleton School in 2008 The school received the following endorsement from the Principal of Phillips Academy. \\"There is a real demand for a true family school for the best educational reasons. Many boys ought not to be sent at a tender age into the broad currents of a great school which approaches close to the intensity and complexity of a college. Many bright boys, intelligent and ambitious, whose main intention is excellent, have not the maturity requisite to insure a steady industry and a well-directed energy. They have never learned how to study, and they require, for a time at least, the friendly oversight of a wise teacher, his timely intervention, his immediate assistance. They are in danger of wasting much time, of becoming impatient and discouraged, of confusing rather than educating their faculties. It is the function of a home school to meet precisely this requirement.\\" History There are three notable periods that defined Carleton School as a preparatory school. The first period ran from 1866 to 1869. In 1868, the school was located in Medford Massachusetts. It was called I.N. Carleton's Home and Day School for Young Ladies. In 1869, Carleton set aside running a private school and went to the New Britain State Normal School (now Central Connecticut State University) in New Britain, Connecticut as the fifth Principal. He served there until 1881. In 1884, Carleton restarted his private school. It was referred to as I.N. Carleton's Home and Day School for Boys in 1886, located in Bradford Massachusetts. This time period was the longest and most defining period in its operation. By 1896, it was simply called Carleton School. The last period of the school's existence was possibly the most dramatic change. It was to be renamed The Carleton Military School in approximately 1901. Carleton was still to hold the position of principal, but a Major Baker was to run the military instruction, having previously been a military instructor at Harvard University summer school. Carleton died 8 August 1902, two months after the expected end of the school year. The location of the school continued to be used as a boarding house, being called the Carleton House for Boys and Young Men in approximately 1925. The school buildings still stand near the corner of Chadwick and South Main Street in Haverhill, being used as apartments. References *Mrs. H. D. Carleton 1997. Carleton Family Album. *I. N.

History The Paramount opened in 1932 as a 1,700-seat, single-screen movie theatre. It was one of the first movie houses in Boston to play talking motion pictures. The theatre was named after its original owner, Paramount Pictures. It closed in 1976 and most of the Art Deco interior decoration was destroyed in the 1980s during the removal of asbestos.Cinema Treasures: Paramount Theater, accessed March 4, 2010 In 1984, the building was designated a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission. In 2002, Millennium Partners agreed to restore the Paramount's facade, marquee, and vertical sign in exchange for city approval of their adjacent Ritz-Carlton Towers project. The city occasionally lighted the sign at night. The city's hopes that the site would be developed by the Cambridge-based American Repertory Theater were not fulfilled. In April 2005, Emerson College announced plans to renovate the Paramount Theatre and build a performing arts facility in and around the original building. The $77 million project involved the renovation of the building and adjacent parcels of land into a complex containing a 550-seat theater, a Performance Development Center, a student residence hall, a 125-seat black box theater, a 170-seat film screening room, eight rehearsal studios ranging from to , six practice rooms for individuals and small groups, a sound stage for film production classes, a scene shop, several classrooms, a restaurant, and up to a dozen offices for faculty and staff. Design was by Elkus Manfredi Architects, Boston.Boston Globe: \\"Emerson to take on Paramount Theater project,\\" April 13, 2005, accessed March 4, 2010 Acentech Incorporated consulted on the acoustical design of the facility, providing guidance on room acoustics, sound isolation between the stacked spaces on the tight urban site, and mechanical system noise control in the historic building.

Written by Jed Seidel and Dayna Lynne North and directed by John Kretchmer, the episode premiered on UPN on January 4, 2005, as the series' first episode in the new year. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica helps Cindy \\"Mac\\" Mackenzie (Tina Majorino) find and reconnect with her birth parents and siblings. Meanwhile, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) is temporarily reassigned to the sheriff's department in order to help with a case involving a serial killer.  Synopsis  One morning, Veronica talks to Keith about an old case involving a serial killer, the E-String Strangler, who has made a reappearance. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) also complains to her about the panic that's been going throughout the town because of the killer. Meanwhile, another student, Jackson, asks Veronica to track his parents. Sheriff Don Lamb (Michael Muhney) and the mayor of the town meet with Keith. After the conversation, Keith comes out and tells Veronica gleefully that he's going to start working at the sheriff's department again. But Keith says that it is only temporary, but he is getting paid his regular salary. Later, another student asks Veronica for help with her parents. Sheriff Lamb and Keith explain the case to other police officers, but they have conflicting styles. Meanwhile, Veronica's parent-seeking business takes off, and Cindy \\"Mac\\" Mackenzie (Tina Majorino) notices. Mac comes up with an idea to double their fees, so they will eventually have enough money for retirement savings. Veronica says she'll think about it. Veronica also finds that Mac's parents once sued the Neptune hospital for 1 million dollars. Veronica finds that Mac was switched at birth. Keith and Sheriff Lamb visit a record shop, but they find nothing. Veronica visits Mac's house, and she shows Veronica her room. Veronica tells her that she was switched at birth with a popular cheerleader, Madison Sinclair. Keith and Sheriff Lamb talk to a suspect, who leads them to a man called \\"The Worm\\" (Aaron Paul), who responds hesitantly. Both of them think he is the killer given that he had a guitar. Veronica, Mac, and Wallace invite themselves over and crash Madison Sinclair's 09er party. Mac looks around the house and meets her biological sister (Carlie Westerman), with whom she connects. The new police officer tells Keith and Sheriff Lamb that \\"The Worm's\\" guitar strings match the strings which were used to strangle the victims. Veronica bribes the new police officer and steals the Lily Kane murder files with the help of Weevil (Francis Capra). Veronica listens to the tapes she stole, and doesn't find anything until she hears a suspicious synthesized voice. Keith and Sheriff Lamb talk to \\"The Worm\\", who sexually abused both the victims. \\"The Worm\\" demands a lawyer. Veronica contacts Mac about the synthesized voice and tells her that there was a reason why she was not switched back to the right parents. Mac goes to Madison Sinclair's house under the guise of looking for her purse. A woman runs screaming into the Sheriff's department reporting a missing daughter. Keith tracks Veronica out of fear for her. He finds Veronica and tells her about the new missing girl. Keith breaks into the record shop he earlier entered with the man who previously mocked him. Mac tells Veronica that she's decoded the message. Veronica eventually says that she knows whose voice it is. Mac sees her biological mom waiting in the car outside with tears in her eyes. She puts her hand on the window and touches her mom's hand before her mom drives away. It turns out that the voice is Clarence Wiedman's voice, the man who took unauthorized photos of her. Veronica takes pictures of him and his family and sends them to him as revenge.  Cultural references  Many cultural references are made in the episode: *The title of the episode is a direct reference to the novel The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris *Madison's parents send her a string quartet which plays \\"Birthday\\" for her birthday. *Veronica mentions Rod Serling. *Sheriff Lamb compares the E-String Strangler case to the Hillside Strangler murders, a real life incident in which two men strangled tens of girls to death. *Veronica references the Internet Movie Database. *Keith is surprised that Sheriff Lamb has never seen This is Spinal Tap. *Mac and Veronica mention Fievel Mousekewitz, a character in the 1986 animated film An American Tail. *Mac's blood sister is reading The Westing Game. *Mac derides Madison's art appreciation by saying that she wouldn't recognize Claude Monet's Water Lilies unless Revlon created and named a nail polish after it. *Keith and Sheriff Lamb decide whether or not to play \\"Good cop/bad cop\\" with their suspect. *Mac's adoptive father references the 2000 memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.  Music  Several songs are played in the episode: *\\"Birthday\\" by The Beatles *\\"Brilliant Sky\\" by Saybia *\\"Fireflies\\" by Amy Cook *\\"The Way You Are\\" by 46bliss  Production  Series regulars Jason Dohring and Teddy Dunn, who play Logan Echolls and Duncan Kane, respectively, do not appear in the episode, despite being credited. This episode is also the first to air in 2005 as opposed to 2004. However, this (and the previous episode) are the only episodes of the series to be aired out of production order. The previous episode, \\"An Echolls Family Christmas\\" was produced after this episode, but was aired before, due to \\"An Echolls Family Christmas\\" being a Christmas-themed episode which aired as season's final episode of the year in December 2004. In addition, UPN also aired this episode later because executives believed that the material was too dark for the holidays. The episode's title is a semi-joking reference to the 1991 horror thriller The Silence of the Lambs and the 1988 novel of the same name on which the film was based. The film, the novel, and the episode all deal with serial killers and the brave female detectives who hunt them down (in the case of The Silence of the Lambs, this character is Clarice Starling). Among this episode's guest stars include Tina Majorino, who makes her second appearance on the show (after \\"Like a Virgin\\") and Aaron Paul, who would later receive three Primetime Emmy Award wins for his performance as Jesse Pinkman on Breaking Bad.  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, \\"Silence of the Lamb\\" received 2.84 million viewers, ranking 98 of 107 in the weekly rankings. This episode's rating marked an increase of almost 1 million viewers from the previous episode, \\"An Echolls Family Christmas. = Reviews = Price Peterson of TV.com wrote positively of the episode. In his episode verdict, the reviewer wrote, \\"that driveway scene between Mac and her birth mom was some great television, and the serial killer plot line was surprisingly intense for this show…Fortunately both plot lines were balanced pretty well. Great episode.\\" Television Without Pity gave the episode a \\"B+\\". Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V.

However, for every polynomial of degree at least 2 there are points for which the Newton iteration does not converge to any root: examples are the boundaries of the basins of attraction of the various roots. There are even polynomials for which open sets of starting points fail to converge to any root: a simple example is z^3-2z+2, where some points are attracted by the cycle 0, 1, 0, 1 ... rather than by a root. An open set for which the iterations converge towards a given root or cycle (that is not a fixed point), is a Fatou set for the iteration. The complementary set to the union of all these, is the Julia set. The Fatou sets have common boundary, namely the Julia set. Therefore, each point of the Julia set is a point of accumulation for each of the Fatou sets. It is this property that causes the fractal structure of the Julia set (when the degree of the polynomial is larger than 2). To plot interesting pictures, one may first choose a specified number d of complex points (\\\\zeta_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\zeta_d) and compute the coefficients (p_1,\\\\ldots,p_d) of the polynomial :p(z)=z^d+p_1z^{d-1}+\\\\cdots+p_{d-1}z+p_d:=(z-\\\\zeta_1)\\\\cdot\\\\cdots\\\\cdot(z-\\\\zeta_d). Then for a rectangular lattice z_{mn} = z_{00} + m \\\\, \\\\Delta x + in \\\\, \\\\Delta y, m = 0, \\\\ldots, M - 1, n = 0, \\\\ldots, N - 1 of points in \\\\mathbb{C}, one finds the index k(m,n) of the corresponding root \\\\zeta_{k(m,n)} and uses this to fill an M×N raster grid by assigning to each point (m,n) a color f_{k(m,n)}. Additionally or alternatively the colors may be dependent on the distance D(m,n), which is defined to be the first value D such that z_D - \\\\zeta_{k(m,n)} < \\\\epsilon for some previously fixed small \\\\epsilon > 0.  Generalization of Newton fractals  A generalization of Newton's iteration is : z_{n+1}=z_n- a \\\\frac{p(z_n)}{p'(z_n)} where a is any complex number. The special choice a=1 corresponds to the Newton fractal. The fixed points of this map are stable when a lies inside the disk of radius 1 centered at 1\\\\. When a is outside this disk, the fixed points are locally unstable, however the map still exhibits a fractal structure in the sense of Julia set. If p is a polynomial of degree d, then the sequence z_n is bounded provided that a is inside a disk of radius d centered at d. More generally, Newton's fractal is a special case of a Julia set.

The \\"Mandelbrot\\" variant of the Nova fractal initializes c to the pixel coordinates and sets z_0 to a critical point, where \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z} G(a, c, z) = 0. Commonly-used polynomials like p(z) = z^3 - 1 or p(z) = (z-1)^3 lead to a critical point at z = 1.  Implementation  In order to implement the Newton Fractal, it is necessary to have a starting function as well as its derivative function: : f(z) = z^3 - 1 : f'(z) = 3z^2 The roots of the function are : z = 1, -0.5 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{3}/2i The above-defined functions can be translated in pseudocode as follows: //z^3-1 float2 Function (float2 z) { return cpow(z, 3) - float2(1, 0); //cpow is an exponential function for complex numbers } //3*z^2 float2 Derivative (float2 z) { return 3 * cmul(z, z); //cmul is a function that handles multiplication of complex numbers } It is now just a matter of implementing the Newton method using the given functions. float2 roots[3] = //Roots (solutions) of the polynomial { float2(1, 0), float2(-.5, sqrt(3)/2), float2(-.5, -sqrt(3)/2) }; color colors[3] = //Assign a color for each root { red, green, blue } For each pixel (x, y) on the target, do: { zx = scaled x coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot X scale (-2.5, 1)) zy = scaled y coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot Y scale (-1, 1)) float2 z = float2(zx, zy); //Z is originally set to the pixel coordinates for (int iteration = 0; iteration < maxIteration; iteration++;) { z -= cdiv(Function(z), Derivative(z)); //cdiv is a function for dividing complex numbers float tolerance = 0.000001; for (int i = 0; i < roots.Length; i++) { float difference = z - roots[i]; //If the current iteration is close enough to a root, color the pixel. if (abs(difference.x) < tolerance && abs (difference.y) < tolerance) { return colors[i]; //Return the color corresponding to the root } } } return black; //If no solution is found }  See also  * Julia set * Mandelbrot set References Further reading * J.

According to G. F. Stout (cf. Manual of Psychology, i. 57), presentations are whatever constituents or our total experience at any moment directly determine the nature of the object as it is perceived or thought of at that moment. In Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, vol. ii., a presentation is an object in the special form under which it is cognized at any given moment of perceptual or ideational process. This, the widest definition of the term, due largely to Professor James Ward, thus includes both perceptual and ideational processes. The term has, indeed, been narrowed so as to include ideation, the correlative representation being utilized for ideal presentation, but in general the wider use is preferred. When the mind is cognizing an object, the object presents itself to the senses or to thought in one of a number of different forms (e.g. a picture is a work of art, a saleable commodity, a representation of a house, etc.). Presentation is thus essentially a cognitive process. Hence the most important use of the term presentationism, which is defined by Ward, in Mind, N.S. (1893), ii. 58, as a doctrine the gist of which is that all the elements of psychical life are primarily and ultimately cognitive elements. This use takes precedence of two others: (1) that of Hamilton, for presentative as opposed to representative theories of knowledge, and (2) that of some later writers who took it as equivalent to phenomenon. Ward traces the doctrine in his sense to David Hume, to whom the mind is a kind of theatre in which perceptions appear and vanish continually (see Green and Grose edition of A Treatise of Human Nature, p. 534). The main problem is as to whether psychic activity is presented or not. Ward holds that it is not presented or presentable save indirectly.

Overview Kirk in the Hills is situated on a 40-acre setting on Island Lake. It is of Gothic design and is patterned after the famous Melrose Abbey in Scotland that was built in the 13th century. The sanctuary is situated at the east end of Cedarholm, which was the home of Colonel Edwin S. George, whose gift of his home and estate in 1947 made the Kirk possible. As early as 1933 he saw the need for a church in this area and established the George Foundation for that purpose. The congregation was organized by the Presbytery of Detroit in 1947, and the first services were held that year in Cedarholm Chapel. The cornerstone for the church was laid in 1951, the same year Colonel George died. His remains are entombed under the Narthex of the Kirk's sanctuary. The architectural firm of George D. Mason completed the church based on preliminary designs by Wirt Rowland.Smith, Michael G. (2001). Designing Detroit - Wirt Rowland and the Rise of Modern American Architecture. Wayne State University Press. . Rowland, who worked for Mason at the beginning of his career, died in 1946 during the design process. Services were held in the Undercroft beginning in 1952 and continued during the construction of the church until a disastrous fire destroyed most of the roof. The Church held its first services in the sanctuary on November 23, 1958. Kirk in the Hills is modeled after Scotland's Melrose Abbey. Set on of beautifully landscaped lakeside grounds, Kirk in the Hills constitutes a fine example of Gothic architecture in the United States. Kirk is the Scottish word for Church.  Tower and carillon  The church includes the Tower of the Apostles. The tower, which houses the world's largest carillon in the number of bells contained, was installed in 1960. The Bells were donated by the Roy A. Fruehauf family and the five largest bells are named after the members of the Fruehauf Family: Roy, Ruth, Royce, Randall, and Ruth Ann. Previously Mr. Fruehauf had donated the Organ to the Church after the fire. Mr. Fruehauf was instrumental in the building of the church and made a generous donation just before his death in 1965. The 77-bells range from a 6'10\\" 6-short ton bourdon to the smallest at 6\\" 14-pounds.  Sculpture  The church contains sculpture by some of the leading architectural sculptors of the day, Lee Lawrie, Corrado Parducci, and John Angel and stone carver Harry Liva.

Co-written by Phil Klemmer and Aury Wallington and directed by David Barrett, the episode premiered on UPN on January 11, 2005. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica is framed for creating fake IDs, and she sets out to find out who the culprit is. Meanwhile, the school guidance counselor, Rebecca James, interviews the people who were most affected by Lilly Kane's (Amanda Seyfried) murder, and Logan's (Jason Dohring) family dramas continue.  Synopsis  Guidance counselor Rebecca James (Paula Marshall), who used to date Keith, has gotten Veronica to come in for a grief therapy session because of a study she is doing. During the session, Veronica plants a stapler with a microphone on the desk. Meanwhile, Sheriff Lamb questions a student, Rick (J.D. Pardo), on his fake IDs. When questioned further, Rick says that Veronica made the IDs, although she did not. During a locker check, Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) finds blank fake IDs spilling out of her locker, as well as four in her purse. Veronica is arrested and taken down to the station. At the station, Veronica confronts Rick. Rick says that an unspecified \\"they\\" forced him to blame Veronica. Later, Logan walks through the hallway and faces scorn and stares from the other students because of the incident with his father. Weevil (Francis Capra) talks to Rebecca while Veronica listens through her car radio. Rebecca shows proof that Weevil and Lilly were dating. Veronica wonders why Lilly didn't tell Veronica about her relationship with Weevil. Veronica meets with Rick in secret, and Rick tells her that a secret society called the Tritons decided to blame her. He is a recent inductee who was trying to get on their good side. Rick also tells Veronica that Duncan (Teddy Dunn) is part of the group. Veronica puts a tracker on Duncan's car. Logan is suspended for a fight that broke out in school. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) and Cliff (Daran Norris) tell Veronica that Rick's friend Tim's family is suing Veronica and Keith because they believe that Veronica created the fake IDs. Later, Wallace tells Veronica that he heard that a mystery locker at school dispenses fake IDs if the participant pays $250. Veronica positions a camera in order to watch the locker 24/7. Rebecca talks to Logan, and Veronica hears over the radio. Logan says that he blames Veronica for Lilly's death. Veronica and Wallace track Duncan to a mysterious location, which turns out to be a club. Veronica finds Duncan and asks him who the leader is, but he doesn't give anything up. Soon afterwards, Duncan brings Veronica a message from \\"The Great Triton,\\" and she has to do karaoke onstage in order to elicit a response from the Triton leader. After the song, she meets with the supposed leader, but it is actually an impostor who reveals that a prank has been played on Veronica. Meanwhile, Rick has become targeted by the Tritons, who threaten him. Veronica hears Duncan's conversation with Rebecca. Duncan states that he has forgotten the days leading up to Lilly's murder. Veronica is abducted and locked in her trunk. After being rescued by Wallace, she hears a Triton chant through her car radio. Veronica goes into the school and sees a ritualistic initiation meeting. She reveals herself and snaps a few photos. The Tritons give chase, but Veronica escapes before they can catch her. Veronica tries to match one of the Tritons to a person who operated the mystery locker, but finds nothing. Veronica visits Sheriff Lamb and makes him a deal—if she doesn't catch the thief by that day, she will plead guilty to any charges. She then asks Lamb to put a student's name into a locker and see what happens. Logan's parents have an argument that becomes increasingly heated before Logan blows up at his dad. Rick goes down to the station and Veronica explains the situation. Rick has been collecting the money from the locker through a hatch. He has been running his own fake IDs, and blamed the Tritons because he was angry at them for not asking him to join. When Veronica asks Rick why he blamed her, he states that it was because Keith's investigations made his family lose money and his parents get a divorce. Meanwhile, we hear a police report that Logan's mother, Lynn (Lisa Rinna), has just committed suicide.

A program was begun to provide more Federal arsenals which would be distributed so that no area of the country would be too far away from an arms depot. Bladen County Representative James McKay introduced House Resolution #374 for inclusion of an arsenal at Fayetteville. The cornerstone for the Arsenal was laid April 9, 1838. It was constructed of brick and stone and at each of the four corners of its massive walls was an octagonal tower. Entry into the Arsenal was controlled by use of massive iron gates. Workshops, quarters and other buildings in the Arsenal were constructed of brick and wood. Civil War When North Carolina seceded from the Union, Governor Ellis commissioned Warren Winslow to bring about the peaceful, if possible, surrender of the Arsenal at Fayetteville. General Walker Draughon, then in command of the North Carolina Militia, was given the order to take possession of the Arsenal. He mobilized the Fayetteville Independent Light Infantry (FILI) (the oldest private military organization in the State, having been organized in 1793) under the command of Major Wright Huske, and the LaFayette Light Infantry, commanded by Capt. Joseph B. Starr. Other troops were used as well, and the total number of troops present on April 22, 1861 was approximately 500. After the Confederate troops had been inspected by the representative of the Federal forces, Lt. DeLagnel, he decided that resistance was fruitless and surrendered the arsenal without incident. It was vacated by Union forces on April 27, 1861. Layout of the Arsenal before Union General Sherman destroyed it in 1865 Major Wright Huske of the FILI \\"took up, in obedience to orders, its permanent quarters there for protection of important and valuable property.\\" After the fall of the Arsenal at Harpers Ferry to Confederate forces in April of 1861, plans were made to relocate the rifle making machinery from that location to new workshops at the Fayetteville Arsenal. Arms-making machinery from Harpers Ferry was installed in October 1861, and the arsenal became a major supplier of small arms to the Confederate troops. The principal armament was known as the Fayetteville Rifle. At its peak, the arsenal produced 500 rifles per month and various numbers of other larger ordnance, cartridges, swords, and bayonets. Over one hundred workmen from the Harpers Ferry Arsenal had relocated with their families to Fayetteville. In the middle years of the war, young ladies of the area were employed in the making of cartridges and as clerks. In 1865, as Union General William T. Sherman led his forces on the Carolinas Campaign it became apparent to the Confederate commander, Colonel Childs, that Fayetteville was a major target. When Sherman reached Columbia, South Carolina, Col. Childs ordered the construction of earthworks for the defense of the Fayetteville area. Remnants of these earthworks can be seen on the grounds of the Veterans Administration Hospital on Ramsey Street. Resistance was given but the battered and weary Confederate forces were overwhelmed by the tremendous numbers and firepower of the Union troops. Sherman entered Fayetteville on March 11, 1865 and took possession of the Arsenal (which had been stripped of its arms, munitions, and useful machinery by the retreating Confederates). The Harpers Ferry rifle manufacturing machinery was said to have been hidden in the Egypt, NC coal mines. Continuing his scorched earth policy, Sherman ordered the Arsenal razed to the ground. His soldiers used railroad rails as battering rams to knock the building down then set the remains on fire. As the fire raged, some remaining artillery shells exploded and completed the devastation. Today Very little remains at the actual site today due to the construction of a central business district loop road through the area in 1988. There is one remaining partial frame outbuilding and a historical marker, and other remnants of the U.S. Arsenal can be seen on display at the Museum of the Cape Fear Historical Complex. The foundations of the buildings that were located along the back wall of the arsenal, including the foundations of two of the towers, can be seen in the park located behind the Museum of the Cape Fear. The Arsenal site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Biography =Early life= Jan Nagórski was born on January 27, 1888 in Włocławek, Russian Empire. He completed a local trade school and in 1909 graduated from an infantry junker school in Odessa and the All-Russian Aeroclub in 1912. The following year he accomplished his training at the Naval Engineering School in Gatchina near St. Petersburg where he earned his wings. He was among the first pilots of the Imperial Russian Navy. =Career= The Farman MF.11 plane used by Jan Nagórski in his pioneering flights off NW Novaya Zemlya In 1914 Nagórski was tasked with the difficult mission of locating the expedition of Georgy Sedov, Georgy Brusilov, and Vladimir Rusanov in the Russian Arctic. In a Maurice Farman MF11 plane, specially purchased for that purpose in France, Nagórski embarked on a ship in Arkhangelsk and arrived to Novaya Zemlya, whence he initiated a series of reconnaissance flights in difficult Arctic conditions. Between August 21 and September 13, 1914, he flew five missions, spending more than ten hours in the air and travelling more than a thousand kilometres over land and the Barents Sea. During the last flight he reached the 76th parallel north. Nagórski failed to find Sedov's expedition, but he gained valuable experience as the first polar aviator in history. His report to the Admiralty prepared after his return, as well as a report of Nagórski's achievements by Admiral Mikhail Zhdanko, included a number of suggestions that would prove invaluable to every polar aviator. Among them was the idea of painting red all the planes operating in the Arctic, to make them more visible. His achievements proved that the North Pole could be reached by airplane. He was awarded the Order of St. Stanislaus, class III in 1914. Upon his return from the Arctic, Nagórski returned to active service in naval aviation during World War I. Stationed in Åbo (Turku) in Finland, he operated a variety of planes on patrol missions above the Baltic Sea and commanded an air squadron of the Baltic Fleet. During that time, he performed the first ever loop with a flying boat (September 17, 1916). The following day Nagórski repeated the loop twice with his experimental Grigorovich M-9 plane. For his wartime service, Nagórski was awarded with five Russian military medals. The following year his plane was damaged above the Baltic Sea and Nagórski was declared missing. After several hours at sea, he was rescued by a Russian submarine and escorted to a military hospital in Riga. He quickly recovered and returned to his unit, but the report of his recovery never reached headquarters. =Return to Poland= After the October Revolution, Nagórski's unit became a part of the Red Army and took part in the Russian Civil War. He returned to Poland in 1919 and attempted to join the Polish Navy, but was turned down due to his past service with the Reds. In the chaos of the Russian Civil War, Nagórski's personal files were lost and he was declared dead by Russian authorities. He then settled in southern Poland and started working as an engineer and designer of refrigerators and coolers for the sugar and oil industries. In 1925 Nagórski's report of his flights to the Arctic reached Richard Byrd, who contacted him and asked for more details on weather conditions and other tips. The information obtained proved valuable during his later Arctic and Antarctic expeditions. Among other pioneers of Arctic aviation to take advantage of Nagórski's experience were Walter Mittelholzer and Boris Chukhnovsky. Forgotten in Poland and believed dead in Russia, Nagórski gained much fame. In 1936 the Nagurskoye meteorological station in Franz Josef Land () was named after him. Nagórski survived World War II and continued his career as a civil worker in Gdańsk and then as an engineer in Warsaw. In 1955, during one of his lectures, Czesław Centkiewicz, a renowned Polish polar explorer and author, presented the audience with a short biographical note of a \\"long-forgotten pioneer of aviation, pilot Jan Nagórski who died in 1917\\". Nagórski, who remained interested in exploration of the polar areas and was present at the lecture stood up and announced that he was not Russian and definitely not dead. This revelation became widely publicised by the Polish media and Nagórski's achievements were rediscovered. On Centkiewicz's suggestion, Nagórski described his Arctic flights in a book entitled The First Above Arctic (1958). In 1960 he published Over the Burning Baltic, the memoirs of his World War I service. As a late recognition of his deeds, Nagórski was awarded the Officer's Cross of the Polonia Restituta by Polish President. =Death= He died on June 9, 1976 and was buried at the Wólka Węglowa cemetery in the Bielany district of Warsaw.

Land held without a charter was known as folkland (). A Model of Land Tenure The meanings of these terms have more depth when their Anglo-Saxon origins are considered. The concept of bookland arose in the seventh century and referred to land that could be 'alienated' (i.e., disposed of) at will. It evolved to resemble ownership in the modern sense. Folkland was land held under ancient, unwritten folk-law or custom and by that custom it could not be alienated (i.e., removed) from the kin of the holder, except under special circumstances. No such claim by the kin could be made on bookland. The definition of those ancient folk-laws and customs, and the definition of the word folkland, has long been the subject of controversy. The model suggested by the historian Patrick Wormald, given in the definition above, allows for the graceful sidestepping of that controversy. Land. A related concept was loanland (), which was land granted temporarily, without any loss of ownership. Such land might be granted for a term of years, or for the life of a person, or it might be granted to an official for the term of his office (e.g., as royal patronage). Both folkland and bookland might become loanland at one time or another.  Historical background  By ancient law and custom, folkland was the only means of holding land in Anglo-Saxon England, and referred to land held by a single person as the representative of a kinship group. Land could be permanently transferred outside of the kinship group, or \\"alienated\\", but only with the agreement of the king and the witanagemot. Failing that, land could be transferred only within the kinship group, for example through inheritance. However, the exact nature of these unwritten ancient customs is not clearly understood, and might include several different types of land tenure, such as kinship holdings intended to remain within the kinship, or holdings of the king to be granted as rewards for service, or holdings of the people as a whole (the \\"folk\\") to be granted in their name by the king, or any combination of these. The concept of bookland entered Anglo-Saxon law in the seventh century via the influence of the late Roman Empire's Vulgar Law,See Eric John's Land Tenure in Early England (1960) and referred to land that was granted in perpetuity by a charter, and thereafter could be conveyed from anyone to anyone else at will. This was its only practical distinction from \\"folkland\\". The altering of the law to add this concept had its origins in the christianisation of the Anglo-Saxons in the seventh century. As neither the Church nor its clergy could be fitted into the existing laws of land tenure, Anglo-Saxon law added the granting of charters as a means of supporting them. It had been intended as a permanent grant of land for landowners building religious establishments, with the stipulation that the holder must perform road and bridge upkeep and supply men for the fyrd. Though there is evidence that this was not the first charter to be written in Anglo-Saxon England, the earliest surviving genuine charter, in favour of the abbot and monastery at Reculver, in Kent, was granted by King Hlothere of Kent in May 679.Online text of charter . See also Webster, L. & Backhouse, J. (eds.), The Making of England Anglo-Saxon Art and Culture AD 600-900, British Museum Press, 1991, pp. 43-4. The desirability of possessing unencumbered \\"bookland\\" in preference to \\"folkland\\" must have been immediately apparent to the laity, as Bede complained in a letter to Archbishop Ecgbert of York in 731, regarding the vast tracts of land acquired by \\"pretended monks\\" whose licentious interests were anything but Christian. To begin with, church land under bookright was exempt from taxation and immune from the trimodia necessitas, that is, the upkeep of bridges and fortifications on the land, and the provision of military service, or fyrd.E. John, Land Tenure in Early England(1960) These immunities were removed from church land by the end of the 8th century, perhaps in response to the situation of which Bede complains. As Anglo-Saxon law evolved, the religious requirement atrophied and was finally discarded, so that bookland resembled full ownership in the modern sense, in that the owner could grant it in his lifetime, in the same manner as he had received it, by boc or book, and also dispose of it by will.  The end of Anglo-Saxon law  The nature of Anglo-Saxon land tenure was substantially changed by the Norman conquest of England in 1066, as all land was then held by the King under Norman feudal control. The King's tenants in chief held their land in return for provision of men at arms to the King. However, the changes in the nature of tenure were not absolute. Military service had been a duty of landholders before 1066 and some Anglo-Saxon law and custom continued to apply after the conquest.Ann Williams, How Land was Held before and after the Norman conquest (in RWH Erskine and Ann Williams, The Story of Domesday Book, Phillimore, 2003) Domesday does not mention folkland or bookland, but the form of tenure in January 1066 (TRE) is frequently given. Although a variety of wording is used. Ann Williams equates land held \\"freely\\" (libere) with bookland. The laws regarding land tenure continued to evolve after the conquest, and there was no return to pre-Norman law and custom. Thus, the distinction between folkland and bookland is of historical interest, but without a substantive modern impact. However, the legacy of the pre-Norman Anglo-Saxon kingdoms is certainly of interest to those of Anglo-Saxon heritage, and to scholars attempting to construct histories and attempting to provide a full legal provenance for modern English law. As few ancient records have survived, constructed histories are necessarily conjectural, with much room for disagreement. This accounts for the tautological definition: it represents an effort to be accurate while sidestepping any and all ongoing disputes regarding ancient Anglo-Saxon law and custom.  Controversies over folkland  The exact meaning of the term folkland has been the subject of considerable controversy. However, the definition of bookland has suffered from less uncertainty, as its inception is within recorded history, with numerous examples available in the records. Ignoring any prior conjectures, the idea that folkland was land owned by the entire folk was introduced by John Allen in his 1830 Inquiry into the Rise and Growth of the Royal Prerogative in England. He asserted that the land was the property of the people as a whole, to be let out at will, and returned to the people's control when the grant had expired. Tenure of Landed Property This became the accepted view of mainstream historians, Folkland. A lengthy list of respected historians and jurists is provided, and others are mentioned in the course of the article, including internationals. Allen's view had attracted very wide support. who then developed arguments and theories based on the correctness of the proposition. In a short article in The English Historical Review of 1893, Paul Vinogradoff asserted that folkland referred to land governed by folklaw or custom. It was this law that kept land within a family or kinship group, and folkland was not land collectively owned by the folk. He said that such land was held by a single representative of a kinship group, and that such land could not be alienated from (i.e., transferred from) the kinship group without special permission. Folkland. Vinogradoff then proceeded to show that his assertion was everywhere consistent with the historical record and nowhere inconsistent, pointing out along the way that neither the \\"accepted view\\" nor its derivatives satisfied the criterion of historical consistency. While the idea of folkland as the common land of the folk was effectively put to rest for some, others persisted in their beliefs. The Anglo-Saxon System, for example. Vinogradoff's own assertion did not go unchallenged, even by those who agreed with the thrust of his argument. Some, such as Frederic Maitland, gave partial or cautious support, Book-land and Folk-land while others rejected the assertion and offered their own definitions. A more recent text dealing explicitly with these controversies is Eric John's 1960 work, Land Tenure in Early England.E. John, Land Tenure in Early England (1960) He emphatically denies the previously held view that bookland evolved to take the land out of the family line, and in fact developed specifically to keep it within the family, claiming that the king's power over folkland remained too powerful and that his favour depended too much on a subject's good behaviour towards him. An episode from Beowulf is employed to indicate that a subject who displeased the king was likely to have his folkland removed. Bookland, by contrast, provided the holder more definite powers of bequest removed from royal influence. As there are only three explicit references to folkland in surviving documents, few plausible definitions can be ruled out, so long as they satisfy the criterion of historical consistency. The tautological definition sidesteps the controversy: it is agreed that all land that is not bookland is folkland. Ros Faith describes folkland as \\"the counterpart or antithesis of bookland\\".

The term for \\"covenant\\" (Hebrew bərīt) appears also in Ugaritic texts (second millennium BCE) as brt, in connection with Baʿal, and perhaps as Beruth in Sanchuniathon's work.  In the Bible  Judges is the only Biblical book that mentions Baʿal Berith and El Berith.. It is not clear whether they are actually one god, nor whether they are separate forms of Baʿal and El. Scholars suppose that he or they may have been worshipped for connections to fertility and vegetation, based on another passage in Judges.. Also unclear is what covenant or covenants are referred to by the name Berith. Elsewhere, some of the Shechemites are called \\"men of Hamor\\";. this is compared to \\"sons of Hamor\\", which in the ancient Middle East referred to people who had entered into a covenant sealed by the sacrifice of a hamor, an ass. \\"Children of Hamor\\" or \\"sons of Hamor\\" itself appears in Genesis. and Joshua,. in both of which, as in Judges, Hamor is called the father of Shechem. Genesis also. features a man named Hamor who ruled in the area of Shechem. and had a son named Shechem. Rabbinic tradition equates Baʿal Berith with Beelzebub, the god of Philistine Ekron.  Proposed relation to Berouth  In his euhemeristic account of the Phoenician deities, Sanchuniathon says that a certain Elioun, called also \\"the Most High\\", and a female named Berouth or Beruth dwelt in the neighbourhood of Byblos, on the coast of present-day Lebanon. They had two children—a male called Epigeius/Autochthon/Sky and a daughter called Earth. Because of the latter pair's beauty, the sky and the earth, respectively, were named after them. According to Sanchuniathon it is from Sky and Earth that El and various other deities are born, though ancient texts refer to El as creator of heaven and earth. A relationship with Hebrew bərīt (\\"covenant\\") or with the city name Beirut have both been suggested for Beruth. However, Robert R. Stieglitz showed how Berouth is best connected to bʾrôt, a name for the primordial sea, tehom.  Rabbinic literature  The idol Baʿal Berith, which the Jews worshipped after the death of Gideon, was identical, according to the Rabbis, with Baʿal Zebub, \\"the lord of flies,\\" the god of Ekron (). He was worshipped in the shape of a fly; and Jewish tradition states that so addicted were the Jews to his cult that they would carry an image of him in their pockets, producing it, and kissing it from time to time. Baʿal Zebub is called Baʿal Berith because such Jews might be said to make a covenant (Hebrew: berith) of devotion with the idol, being unwilling to part with it for a single moment (Shab. 83b; comp. also Sanh. 63b). According to another conception, Baʿal Berith was an obscene article of idolatrous worship, possibly a simulacrum priapi (Yer. Shab. ix. 11d; 'Ab. Zarah iii. 43a). This is evidently based on the later significance of the word \\"berit,\\" meaning circumcision. Christianity According to the Admirable History written by Father Sebastien Michaelis in 1612, Baʿal Berith once possessed a nun in Aix- en-Provence. In the process of the exorcism, Baʿal Berith volunteered not only his own name and the names of all the other demons possessing her, but the names of the saints who would be most effective in opposing them.

This intermittent contact usually continues through the duration of your ski day especially on aggressive terrain that can cause the skier to migrate to skiing in the back seat. -Skiing in a back seat posture: Skiing in the back seat, also known as skiing with your weight behind your feet, places a lot of pressure and strain on your lower legs. The poor skiing form not only intensifies contact with the lower part of your shin and the boot but it also can strain muscles that can make you feel especially sore. -Ski boots that are too stiff: Skiing in a boot that is too stiff can effectively limit how forward you can get on your skis. With today's more up right ski boot stances, failure to properly flex a boot can almost force a skier into the back seat. When choosing a ski boot flex, make sure you can effectively flex the boot at room temperature, as it will only get stiffer with the onset of colder temperatures. Ideal flex on a four buckle boot is achieved when the middle buckles come in close proximity to each other but do not touch. Note however that stronger, more aggressive skiers can benefit from a stiffer flex boot especially if they consistently ski in a forward athletic position. -Aggressive skiing: Skiing through rough terrain can cause a lot of shock to your lower legs. Examples include: those bumps you fail to see until you have already hit them, moguls, hard pack snow, crusty snow conditions etc. -Landing jumps or drops in the back seat: This one gets almost everyone from time to time. In most cases the action causes muscles and tendons to stretch beyond their conditioned level. In other cases, the force of landing in the back seat can cause stress fractures in the Tibia. These fractures are most likely caused from the Tibia bending as a result of the upper cuff of the ski boot acting as a fulcrum for the upper body. Typically this can be the cause of chronic shin bang Remedies for shin-bang There are many purported remedies for shin-bang. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Ibuprofen may help some athletes ski through the discomfort, but rest is ultimately the most effective remedy. A properly fitting and flexing boot is crucial to preventing this condition. Booster Straps Booster Straps are a product designed to reduce shin-bang along with other benefits. Booster straps are an upgrade to your boot’s normal power straps which include an elastic portion. Booster straps allow you to cinch the power strap tighter, compressing the boot liner tighter to the leg. Additionally, the elastic portion of the booster strap allows skiers to stay out of the backseat and dorsiflex more due to the “forgiveness” in the strap.

The camp was near the tracks of the Atlantic and Coastal Railroad and paralleled a creek that led to the Newport River (which in turn leads to Beaufort Inlet). The camp was heavily fortified by occupying Union forces based in New Bern following the Battle of New Bern on March 14, 1862, and was guarded by Fort Benjamin, a small earthwork defensive structure with 6- and 12-pound cannon armament. Primary occupants of the site were infantry and artillery units from Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The site was overrun by Confederate forces on February 2, 1864 and briefly held. As of 2006, no remains are visible and the site is adjacent to a strawberry farm and electrical power substation. A historical marker is located on Old U.S. 70 before the bridge as a traveler enters the town of Newport from the east.

The series was recorded between Spring to Winter 2004, in which it featured TV chef Jamie Oliver attempting to improve the quality and nutritional value of school dinners at a typical British school, Kidbrooke School in the Royal Borough of Greenwich -- a goal which ultimately led to a broader campaign (called Feed Me Better) to improve school dinners throughout Britain. Kidbrooke School At Kidbrooke, Oliver first encountered the school's seemingly fearsome head dinner lady, Nora Sands. Although the two clashed frequently over matters from kitchen technique to workload, Nora eventually became Jamie's most ardent supporter throughout the series and the campaign. Oliver had his work cut out for him: firstly, the daily budget for school dinners was a mere 37 pence per child. Secondly, the students at the school were so used to eating processed junk food (such as deep fried meat products and chips) that Oliver faced a student rebellion when he banned junk food from the school. Thirdly, Oliver's unconventional ingredients and meal ideas startled the dinner ladies, increased their workload dramatically, and exceeded the allocated budget. Boot camp After a disastrous start at Kidbrooke, with students refusing to eat and dinner ladies threatening to resign due to overwork, Oliver organised a \\"boot camp\\" for dinner ladies in the borough, roping in the catering division of the British Army to demonstrate how to cook large amounts of food quickly and efficiently. County Durham Statistically, the English county of Durham had the highest rate of health problems among school children in the country. Oliver visited a primary school in Peterlee, and realised that part of the problem with getting children to eat healthier food was the food they were eating at home. He visited a young boy's family and convinced them to try a healthier home-cooked menu for a week. Return to London Returning to Greenwich, Oliver faced a student boycott of his new menu. He produced an education kit, and recruited children to work in the kitchen, demonstrating to them exactly what went into chicken nuggets, and teaching them to identify vegetables. As the campaign gathered momentum, gaining increasing public support, Oliver approached members of the government, to campaign for increased funding for ingredients and staff wages in school canteens. Results of the show and campaign The British Government, and Prime Minister Tony Blair promised to take steps to improve school dinners shortly after the programme aired. 271,677 people signed an online petition on the Feed Me Better website, which was delivered to 10 Downing Street on 30 March 2005. Certain junk foods (such as the notorious Bernard Matthews \\"Turkey Twizzlers\\" much derided on the show) were banned from schools by their local borough or county council. Currently fried foods are only allowed to be served twice a week and soft drinks are no longer available. The Department for Education and Skills created the School Food Trust, a £60 Million initiative to provide support and advice to school administrators to improve the standard of school meals. Jamie's Return to School Dinners Starting in February 2006, Oliver returned to his crusade to see how his flagship Greenwich school, Kidbrooke, was progressing. Overworked and under pressure, Nora reveals that she is losing money due to the decision to close the school tuck shop (which sold junk food and snacks), that she wasn't being paid for the extra hours, and that she hadn't seen any of the promised money. The end-of-year deficit is between £12000 and £15000 (the school management declined to be precise, on the advice of the local council), the children are slipping back into their old habits, and Jamie's new menu is losing popularity. In response, Jamie organises a 'Junk Amnesty' wherein the children exchange their snacks and unhealthy food for tokens which can then be redeemed for healthier meals at a kiosk Jamie sets up in their playground. Jamie then travels to Lincolnshire, where most of the schools have decommissioned their kitchens to save money. He pioneers a project that connects the schools to local pubs, restaurants, and hotels, and to local farmers. Produce would be sourced locally, cooked, and then taken to nearby schools by taxi or volunteer drivers. In order to make the project viable, he has to convince 90% of the local parents to participate. A pilot scheme is started to provide Theddlethorpe and Saltfleetby primary schools in Lincolnshire with hot meals, with the help of a local pub. However, there are problems. Nora has hygiene concerns regarding the pub kitchen, and the pub cook has been altering the recipes in an attempt to save money, which Jamie remedies by introducing him to a local supplier. Initial take-up is good, following a demonstration to parents of a terms'-worth of junk food that their children eat (a plastic mat with a pile of chips (2 binfuls), saturated fat, Coke, burgers, with a garnish of crisps and sweets), and a brief speech at the school's Easter service. To spread the word, Jamie organises a fête for local schools, suppliers and caterers in Lincoln Castle. There he encourages connections between parents, schools, and food industry representatives. The event ('Hot Dinners For Imps') is a resounding and overwhelming success, and garners support from the local council. =Results= In London, meeting first with Alan Johnson, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, and Prime Minister Tony Blair, Jamie secures promises of an additional £280M for 3 years, a trust to allow schools without kitchens to build, a pledge to consider a series of training kitchens across the country, and creation of a voluntary code of conduct concerning advertising of junk food to children. Effect on Exam Results In 2009, a report was released that after the implementation of Jamie's School Dinners program test scores in English and science improved. The report was conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research located at Essex University. It measured the performance of 11-year-old students from Greenwich, south London from 2006-2007, allowing a full year of performance to be measured. The results showed the number of students to receive a 4 or a 5 on their science exams increased by 8%, while English scores rose by 6% and maths also showed a slight increase in performance. Criticism In July 2009, the Daily Mail released an article stating that the number of students eating meals at school had decreased by as much as 400,000. School spokesman David Laws says the government rushed into the legislation too quickly, and will be unable to meet its target requirement of participation. He believes what is needed is \\"more investment in the school meals service and a massive change in expectations, so that sitting down for a proper lunch once again becomes the norm for every child.\\" See also * Healthy Kids School Canteen Association References External links *Feed Me Better campaign *St.Aidans Catering 4 Schools Category:2005 British television series debuts Category:2005 British television series endings Category:2000s British documentary television series Category:Channel 4 original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Food reality television series Category:Government-provided school meals in the United Kingdom Category:Obesity in the United Kingdom ","title":"Jamie's School Dinners"},{"id":"3918697","text":"Götz Briefs (born 1 January 1889 in Eschweiler; died 16 May 1974 in Rome) was a Catholic social theorist, social ethicist, social philosopher and political economist, who together with Gustav Gundlach, SJ influenced the social teachings of Pope Pius XI. Biography In 1908, Briefs began to study history and philosophy at the University of Munich. As it was customary in German academic circles at the time, he frequently switched universities, moving in 1909 to Bonn, and later in 1911 to Freiburg. In Freiburg, he became a member of K.D.St. V. Wildenstein Freiburg im Breisgau, a Catholic student fraternity that belong to the Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen. In 1911, he completed his doctoral dissertation with an investigation of the influence of the alcoholic beverage industry on market price structures. He was awarded the highest honor summa cum laude for his dissertation and continued on the topic of profits with his Habilitation on the effect of average profits on the economy in 1913. In 1919, he was named Professor for economics at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität in Freiburg. Two years later 1921 he accepted a professorship at the Julius-Maximilian- Universität in Würzburg.

Brigandage is the life and practice of highway robbery and plunder.Oxford English Dictionary second edition, 1989. \\"Brigandage\\" The first recorded usage of the word was by \\"[Clive] Holland Livy XXXVIII. xlv. 1011e, A privat brigandage and robberie.\\" It is practiced by a brigand, a person who usually lives in a gang and lives by pillage and robbery.Oxford English Dictionary second edition, 1989. \\"Brigand.2\\" first recorded usage of the word was by \\"H. LUTTRELL in Ellis Orig. Lett. II. 27 I. 85 Ther ys no steryng of none evyl doers, saf byonde the rivere of Sayne..of certains brigaunts.\\" The word brigand entered English as brigant via French from Italian as early as 1400. Under the laws of war, soldiers acting on their own recognizance without operating in chain of command, are brigands, liable to be tried under civilian laws as common criminals. However, on occasions brigands are not mere malefactors, but may be the last resort of people subject to invasion. Bad administration and suitable terrain encourage the development of brigands. Historical examples of brigands (often called so by their enemies) have existed in territories of France, Greece and the Balkans, India, mainland Italy, Mexico, Sicily and Spain, as well as certain regions of the United States.  Etymology  The English word brigant (also brigaunt) was introduced as early as 1400, via Old French brigand from Italian brigante \\"trooper, skirmisher, foot soldier\\". The Italian word is from a verb brigare \\"to brawl, fight\\" (whence also brigade). For a bandito or bando a man declared outlaw by proclamation, see the article Bandit. Laws of war Towards the end of wars, irreconcilables may refuse to accept the loss of their cause, and may continue hostilities using irregular tactics. Upon capture by the victorious side, whether the capturing power has to recognize them as soldiers (who must be treated as prisoners of war) or as brigands (who can be tried under civilian law as common criminals) depends on whether the detainees \\"respect the laws and customs of war\\" and whether they operate within a chain of command and are \\"not persons acting on their own responsibility\\".  Resistance  In certain conditions the brigand has not been a mere malefactor. Brigandage may be, and not infrequently has been, the last resort of a people subject to invasion. The Calabrians who fought for Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, and the Spanish irregular levies, which maintained the national resistance against the French from 1808 to 1814, were called brigands by their enemies. \\"It is you who are the thieves\\", was the defence of the Calabrian who was tried as a brigand by a French court-martial during the reign of Joachim Murat in Naples. In the Balkan peninsula, under Ottoman rule, the brigands (called klephts by the Greeks and hayduks or haydutzi by the Slavs) had some claim to believe themselves the representatives of their people against oppressors. The only approach to an attempt to maintain order was the permission given to part of the population to carry arms in order to repress the klephts. They were hence called armatoli. In fact the armatole tended to act more as allies than enemies of the klephts. Causes The conditions which favour the development of brigandage may be summed up as bad administration and to a lesser degree, terrain that permits easy escape from the incumbents. The Scottish Marches supplied a theatre for the gentlemen reivers. After the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639–1651), policing the Scottish moss-troopers tied up many English soldiers of the occupying New Model Army. Their contemporaries in Ireland became known as \\"tories\\". Rapparees, Irish guerrillas of a later generation, fought for King James II after the Revolution of 1688 and on his defeat degenerated into brigands. Terrain Xaver Hohenleiter and his robber band The forests of England gave cover to the outlaws, who were flatteringly portrayed in the ballads of Robin Hood. The dense Maquis shrubland and hills of Corsica gave the Corsican brigand many advantages, just as the bush of Australia concealed the bushranger. The Apennines, the mountains of Calabria, the Sierras of Spain, were the homes of the Italian banditi, and the Spanish bandoleros (member of a gang) and salteadores (raiders). The great haunts of brigands in Europe have been central and southern Italy and parts of Spain. Historical examples =England= England was ruled by William III, when \\"a fraternity of plunderers, thirty in number according to the lowest estimate, squatted near Waltham Cross under the shades of Epping Forest, and built themselves huts, from which they sallied forth with sword and pistol to bid passengers stand\\". The Gubbings (so called in contempt from the trimmings and refuse of fish) infested Devonshire for a generation from their headquarters near Brent Tor, on the edge of Dartmoor. =France= In France there were the Écorcheurs, or Skinners, in the 15th century, and the Chauffeurs around the time of the revolution. The first were large bands of discharged mercenary soldiers who pillaged the country. The second were ruffians who forced their victims to pay ransom by holding their feet in fires. In the years preceding the French Revolution, the royal government was defied by the troops of smugglers and brigands known as faux saulniers, unauthorized salt-sellers, and gangs of poachers haunted the king's preserves round Paris. The salt monopoly and the excessive preservation of the game were so oppressive that the peasantry were provoked to violent resistance and to brigandage. The offenders enjoyed a large measure of public sympathy, and were warned or concealed by the population, even when they were not actively supported. David Hannay writing in the 1911 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica stated that in \\"Corsica the maquis has never been without its brigand hero, because industry has been stagnant, family feuds persist, and the government has never quite succeeded in persuading the people to support the law. The brigand is always a hero to at least one faction of Corsicans.\\" =Greece and the Balkans= In 1870 an English party, consisting of Lord and Lady Muncaster, Mr Vyner, Mr Lloyd, Mr Herbert, and Count de Boyl, was captured at Oropos, near Marathon, and a ransom of £25,000 was demanded. Lord and Lady Muncaster were set at liberty to seek for the ransom, but the Greek government sent troops in pursuit of the brigands, and the other prisoners were then murdered. In the Balkan peninsula, under Turkish rule, brigandage continued to exist in connection with Christian revolt against the Turks. = India = The dacoits or brigands of India were of the same stamp as their European colleagues. The Pindaris were more than brigands, and the Thugs were a religious sect. = Italy = A small band of brigands from Bisaccia, photographed in 1862. Carmine Crocco Until the middle of the 19th century Italy was divided into small states; therefore, the brigand who was closely pursued in one could flee to another. Thus it was that Marco Sciarra of the Abruzzi, when hard pressed by the Spanish viceroy of Naples – just before and after 1600 – could cross the border of the papal states and return on a favourable opportunity. When pope and viceroy combined against him he took service with Venice, from whence he communicated with his friends at home and paid them occasional visits. On one such visit he was led into a trap and slain. Marco Sciarra was the follower and imitator of Benedetto Mangone, who was documented to have stopped a party of travellers which included Torquato Tasso. Sciarrae allowed them to pass unharmed out of his reverence for poets and poetry. Mangone was finally taken and beaten to death with hammers at Naples. He and his like are the heroes of much popular verse, written in ottava rima beginning with the traditional epic invocation to the muse. A fine example is The most beautiful history of the life and death of Pietro Mancino, chief of Banditi, which begins: In the Kingdom of Naples, every successive revolutionary disturbance saw a recrudescence of brigandage down to the unification of 1860–1861. The source of the trouble was the supporters of brigands (like Carmine Crocco from Basilicata, the most famous outlaw during the Italian unification) received from various kinds of manuténgoli (maintainers) – great men, corrupt officials, political parties, and the peasants who were terrorized, or who profited by selling the brigands food and clothes. In the Campagna in 1866, two English travellers, William John Charles Möens and the Rev. John Cruger Murray Aynsley, were captured and held for ransom; Aynsley was released shortly thereafter. Möens found that the manuténgoli of the brigands among the peasants charged famine prices for food, and extortionate prices for clothes and cartridges. =Mexico= The Mexican brigand Juan Cortina made incursions into Texas before the American Civil War. In Mexico the \\"Rurales\\" ended brigandage. = Spain = Jose María el Tempranillo, legendary Spanish brigand of the 19th century. In Spain brigandage was common in and south of the Sierra Morena. It reached its greatest heights in Andalusia. In Catalonia where it began in the strife of the peasants against the feudal exactions of the landlords. It had its traditional hero, Roque Guinart, who figures in the second part of Don Quixote. The revolt against the house of Austria in 1640 and the War of the Succession (1700–1714) greatly stimululated Catalan brigandage. A country gentleman named Pedro Veciana, hereditary balio (military and civil lieutenant) of the archbishop of Tarragona in the town of Valls, armed his farm-servants and resisted the attacks of the brigands. With the help of neighbouring country gentlemen he formed a strong band, known as the Mozos (Boys) of Veciana. The brigands combined to get rid of him by making an attack on the town of Valls, but were repulsed with great loss. The government of Philip V then commissioned Veciana to raise a special corps of police, the Escuadra de Cataluna, which still exists. For five generations the colonel of the escuadra was always a Veciana. Since the organization of Guardia Civil by the Duke of Ahumada, about 1844, brigandage has been well kept down. At the close of the Carlist War in 1874 a few bands infested Catalonia. In Andalusia, the Sierra Morena, and the Serrania de Ronda, have produced the bandits whose achievements form the subject of popular ballads, such as Francisco Esteban El Guapo (Francis Stephen, the Buck or Dandy), Don Juan de Serralonga, Pedranza, &c.; Jose Maria, called El Tempranillo (The Early Bird), was a liberal in the rising against Ferdinand VII, 1820–1823, then a smuggler, then a bandolero. He was finally bought off by the government and took a commission to suppress the other brigands. Jose Maria was at last shot by one of them, whom he was endeavouring to arrest. =United States= In relatively unsettled parts of the United States there was a considerable amount of a certain kind of brigandage, in early days, when the travel routes to the American West were infested by highwaymen. Such outlaws, when captured, were often dealt with in an extra-legal manner by groups of vigilantes known as vigilance committees. A notable example is the Harpe brothers, who were active during the late 18th century.

Written by John Enbom and directed by Steve Gomer, the episode premiered on UPN on February 8, 2005, after nearly a one-month hiatus since the previous episode, \\"Clash of the Tritons\\". The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica investigates the mysterious disappearance of her old friend, Yolanda (Jowharah Jones) when the girl's father approaches Keith (Enrico Colantoni) for help.  Synopsis  A man, Percy \\"Bone\\" Hamilton (Anthony Anderson), is relaxing by his pool. Soon, his son, Bryce (Jermaine Williams), approaches and says that Yolanda (Jowharah Jones), Bryce's sister and Bone's daughter, has disappeared. Later, Bone enters Mars Investigations and looks for Keith. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) tells Veronica that Bone is a criminal and gangsta rap record company owner. Veronica says that she used to be friends with Yolanda. Keith eventually decides to take up the case, and Bone has a list of people to whom Keith should talk because of rifts between Bone and them. Later, Veronica offers to gather information about Yolanda, which Keith accepts. In a flashback, Veronica helps Yolanda find her English class. Keith visits the first person on Bone's list., Sam Bloom (Bruce Nozick). Veronica talks to Yolanda's friend, Gabrielle, and she finds out that the two were at a club the night of her disappearance. Keith is going to investigate Marcel, the club bouncer who was another one of the enemies on Bone's list. Veronica is eventually allowed to come on the condition that she stays in the car. Keith talks to Marcel, who recommends that he talks to \\"Dime Bag\\" (Sam Sarpong), number two on the enemies list. However, they don't find Dime Bag there. Keith sneaks his way into Dime Bag's apartment in disguise as a mechanic while Veronica waits outside. While Keith is in the room, Dime Bag and his posse appear, and Veronica pretends to be a hotel worker. Keith bugs the suspect's rooms, and they begin to hear their conversation. Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring) and Aaron (Harry Hamlin) get ready for Lynn's (Lisa Rinna) funeral and have a fight in front of the paparazzi. Veronica visits Yolanda's younger brother, who thinks that she has been kidnapped, not simply disappeared. In another flashback, Veronica sees Yolanda kissing Logan and tells Lilly (Amanda Seyfried) about it. Lilly says that they must stop being friends with her. Bone calls Dime Bag, and he says that he knows where Yolanda is. However, it is later revealed through the hidden camera that they are not hiding Yolanda. Veronica and Wallace find out that Sam Bloom has a son, Benjamin, who was with Yolanda at the club the night of her disappearance. When Logan sits in his room and plays video games during Lynn's funeral, Duncan talks to him, and Logan expresses his belief that his mother is not dead, but simply \\"escaped\\". Veronica calls Benjamin's roommate under a guise, and he says that Benjamin left alone for Las Vegas, which means that Sam was lying about his whereabouts. In another flashback, Veronica abandons Yolanda for Lilly. Bone comes to Keith with a ransom note for $500,000. However, the drop location is already specified and the area is under heavy surveillance. Bone believes that Dime Bag is the kidnapper. During the drop, Bone places his wedding ring inside of a plastic football and shoves it down the drain per the \\"kidnapper's\\" orders. However, it turns out that Yolanda's brother was behind the whole scheme and intercepts the plastic football at the beach. It turns out that Bryce actually planned the whole scheme, and that the entire plot was to stop Yolanda from running away. Keith, Veronica, and Bryce talk to Bone and his wife. The three get Yolanda up on a Skype-like camera. She says that she has run off to marry Benjamin Bloom. Yolanda says that she won't come back until Bone's feud with Sam Bloom is over. Later, Veronica calls Yolanda again and apologizes to her for leaving her, and she accepts.  Cultural references  A variety of cultural references are made in the episode: *Bone compares his two children to Velvet Brown from National Velvet and Steve Urkel. *Lynn Echolls left her suicide note on a BlackBerry. *Logan uses the V sign when talking to his father. *Logan uses the phrase, \\"My father thanks you. My mother thanks you. I thank you,\\" a reference to a statement popularized by George M. Cohan. *Logan also mentions ICM Partners, a talent and literary agency. *The video game that Logan plays at his mother's funeral is Fable.  Arc significance  *It was Yolanda Hamilton who kissed Logan, leading to Lilly and Logan's break-up before Lilly's murder. *Logan asks Veronica for help in finding his mother.  Music  The following music can be heard in the episode: *\\"The Bomb\\" by The Pharcyde *\\"The Girl Who Wouldn't Die\\" by Tsar *\\"Saturday Night\\" by Ozomatli *\\"Hey Ma\\" by Cam'ron  Production  Although credited, Eli \\"Weevil\\" Navarro, portrayed by Francis Capra, does not appear in \\"Lord of the Bling\\". This episode also features the return of recurring character Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried), who appears in flashbacks in the episode after being absent since \\"The Girl Next Door\\". The episode's title is a reference to The Lord of the Rings and bling-bling, a slang term for jewelry in hip hop culture. As a joke, the first words spoken before the opening credits in \\"Lord of the Bling\\" are \\"We used to be friends…a long time ago,\\" spoken by Veronica when Wallace asks her about Yolanda. These are the first words heard in the series' theme song, \\"We Used to Be Friends\\" by The Dandy Warhols.  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, \\"Lord of the Bling\\" received 2.97 million viewers, ranking 106th of 116 in the weekly rankings. = Reviews = The episode received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Television Without Pity gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade. Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave the episode a mixed review.

In contemporary English the phrase is also commonly pronounced \\"setty-kay\\" () or \\"sesty-kay\\" (). According to Roebuck, is pronounced \\"setticky yuce\\" ().Roebuck, Derek,[I wrote 'Cestui que use (pronounced 'setticky yuce') beneficiary' DR] \\"The Background of the Common Law\\", Oxford, 1990, Index and trust are more or less interchangeable terms. In some medieval materials, the phrase is seen as . The is the person for whose benefit (i.e. use) the trust is created. The trust is the person entitled to the equitable, as opposed to the legal, estate in the trust assets. Thus, if land is granted to A, for the use of B while in trust, with remainder to C when the trust terminates, A is the trustee, B is , and C the trust. Ordinarily B and C will be the same person, so the terms are generally synonyms. Owing mainly to their cumbersome nature, both have been virtually superseded by the term \\"beneficiary\\" in general trust law. The and are rooted in medieval law, being a legal device for avoiding the feudal services (a medieval form of servitude) due to an overlord, by granting the land for the use of another, one who owed nothing (i.e. no services) to the lord. The law of tended to defer jurisdiction to courts of equity as opposed to the less flexible common law courts. The device of was often utilized by persons who might be absent from the kingdom for an extended time (as on a Crusade, or a business venture), who held a tenancy in the land and in return owed feudal incidents (i.e. services) to the landlord. The land could be left for the use of a third party, who did not owe those incidents to the lord. This legal status was partly invented to circumvent the Statute of Mortmain, which sought to end the relatively common practice of leaving real property (i.e. land) to the Church, on the tenant's death, so as to avoid death duty (taxes) or reversion of the tenancy to the overlord. Two concepts, not mutually exclusive, of the term (literally, \\"dead hand\\") explain its origin. Firstly, the \\"dead hand\\" can be characterised as referring to the deceased donor and former owner, to whose desire, embodied in the testamentary provision that the Church hold the title to the property, the land remained subject. Secondly, because the Church (a nonnatural person recognized by the common law) never dies, the land never leaves the \\"dead hand\\" (more accurately, the non-living hand) of the Church. Before the Statute of Mortmain, large amounts of land had been bequeathed to the Church, which never relinquished it. This legal arrangement was in contradiction to others in which the land could be transferred to anyone, inherited only through a family line (sometimes only the male line), or revert to an over-lord or the Crown upon the death of the tenant. Church land had been a source of contention between the Crown and the Church for centuries. allowed religious orders to continue the former practice of inhabiting the land beneficially, while the legal title rested with a corporation of lawyers or other entities, who nominally had no relationship with the Church, so preserving the pre-Statute practice. History in German and Roman law  It is the opinion of William HoldsworthHoldsworth, W, \\"A History of English Law\\", Brown, Little & Co. 1927, pp. 410–411 quoting such scholars as Gilbert, Sanders, Blackstone, Spence and Digby, that in English law had a Roman origin. An analogy exists between uses and a usufructus (usufruct) or the bequest of a fideicommissum. These all tended to create a feoffement to one person for the use of another. GilbertGilbert, ed. 1811 writes, (also seen in Blackstone):Blackstone ii, 327, 328 \\"that they answer more to the fideicommissum than the usufructus of the civil law.\\" These were transplanted into England from Roman civil law about the close of the reign of Edward III of England by means of foreign ecclesiastics who introduced them to evade the Statute of Mortmain. Others argue that the comparison between and Roman law is merely superficial. The transfer of land for the use of one person for certain purposes to be carried out either in the lifetime or after the death of the person conveying it has its basis in Germanic law. It was popularly held that land could be transferred for the use from one person to another in local custom. The formal English or Saxon law didn't always recognize this custom. The practice was called Salman or . is German for \\"transfer\\".Holdsworth, W.; pp. 410–411 It is related to the Old English , \\"to sell\\". The earliest appearance of in the medieval period was the feoffee to uses, which like the Salman, held on account of another. This was called the . It was because the feoffor could impose on him many various duties that landowners acquired through his instrumentality the power to do many things with their land. This was a to avoid the rigidity of medieval common law of land and its uses. Germanic law was familiar with the idea that a man who holds property on account of, or to the use of another is bound to fulfill his trust. Frankish formulas from the Merovingian period describe property given to a church . Mercian books in the ninth century convey land . The Domesday Book refers to geld or money, sac and soc held in , or in or . The laws of William I of England speak of the sheriff holding money (\\"for the use of the king\\").Legis Wilhelmus I 2 section 3Holdworth, W.; pp. 410–411 Others state that the trust was the product of Roman Law. In England it was the invention of ecclesiastics who wanted to escape the Statute of Mortmain. The goal was to obtain a conveyance of an estate to a friendly person or corporation, with the intent that the use of the estate would reside with the original owner.Bogert, \\"Law of Trusts\\", 1921Fletcher, \\"Corporations, Vol. 9\\", 1920Loring \\"Trustee's Handbook, Second Edition\\", 1900 Pollock and Maitland describe as the first step toward the law of agency.Pollock and Maitland, \\"History of English Law, Vol. 2\\" Cambridge University Press, 1968 p. 228 et seq They note that the word \\"use\\" as it was employed in medieval English law was not from the Latin , but rather from the Latin word , meaning \\"work\\". From this came the Old French words or \\".L. Q. R. iii. 116 Although with time the Latin document for conveying land to the use of John would be written which was interchangeable with , or the fuller formula, , the earliest history suggests the term \\"use\\" evolved from .Pollock and Maitland  Medieval invention  Cistercian Buckland Abbey, established on land near Yelverton, Devon donated by Amicia, Countess of Devon in 1278 Many reasons have been given for the invention of the use as a legal device. During the Crusades, and other wars on the Continent, landowners might be gone for long periods of time. Others might be absent because of business adventures or religious pilgrimages. There was no assurance they would ever return home. The allowed them to leave a trusted friend or relative with the sort of powers, discretions and they hoped, the duties. Today, this power would be called the \\"power of attorney\\". Religious orders such as Franciscans, Cistercians, Benedictines and other mendicant orders took vows of poverty, yet retained the use of donated property. allowed them the benefits of land without legal ownership.Roebuck, Derek, \\"The Background of the Common Law, Second Edition\\", Oxford University Press, 1990, p. 75Holdsworth, W. \\"A History of English Law\\", Brown, Little & Co., 1927 pp. 410–411 Besides the obvious limitations placed on by the Statute of Mortmain, Statute of Uses and the Statute of Wills, its legality was shaped indirectly by provisions within the Magna Carta and .  Typical medieval patterns  Derek RoebuckRoebuck, Derek, \\"The Background of the Common Law, Second Edition\\", Oxford University Press, 1990 pp. 75–80 has given the following typical fact patterns which were often found in medieval cestui que use: Example 1: Albert is the owner of a landholding called Blackacre. He conveys this to Richard with the command that Richard hold the land with the duty not for Richard's benefit, but for a different purpose. This could be to do a job, such as collect rents and profits for the purpose of passing them to a third person, Lucy. This was nothing more than a clever legal device with Richard playing either an active or passive role. Example 2: If Jane (women could engage in cestui que use), granted Blackacre to Charles to the use of David, then David became the beneficial owner and Jane could not vary or detract from that ownership. Example 3: If Mary wanted to grant Blackacre away from her direct heir James, to her younger son Jasper, then she might well do so by a grant of Richard to the use of Jasper in tail, remainder to James in fee simple. Only Richard had a legal estate, the interests of Jasper and James being equitable analogues of a legal fee tail and fee simple in remainder. Example 4: If Mary wanted to make a will of the equitable ownership of Blackacre, she would be able to do so by a grant to Richard to the use of herself, Mary. The ownership of Blackacre did not pass on Mary's death to her heir but went to wherever she might will it. By this method, Mary could keep her wishes secret until her death when her will would be read, and would prevail. This was a way to defeat primogeniture inheritance. Example 5: Uses were so common by the middle of the fifteenth century that they were presumed to be in existence even if no intention could be proved. If Martin granted Blackacre to Martha, and she could show no consideration (that is, that she paid for it), then Martha would be considered in equity to be the feoffee to unspecified uses to be announced at Martin's discretion. If Martin sold Blackacre to Martha, but did not go through the formal routines of feoffment to complete the conveyance, Martha could not become the legal owner. But in equity, Martin held the land to the cestui que use of Martha. It would have been unconscionable for him to do otherwise having taken her money for the sale of Blackacre. Example 6: Albert might convey Blackacre to Richard for the use of Jane. In this case, Richard was called the \\"feoffee of uses\\". Jane was the \\"cestui que use\\". This was short for \\"cestui a qui use le feoffment fuit fait\\", i.e. \\"The person to whose use the feoffment was made.\\" This device separated legal from beneficial ownership.  Cestui que as a method of fraud  From the Doctor and Student (1518) \\"Doctor and Student\\", Christopher St. Germaine, 1518 \\"It will be somewhat long and peradventure somewhat tedious to show all the causes particularly.\\" By the fifteenth century, cestui que use was a vehicle to defraud creditors. The main use was to leave land, or parts of land to members of the family other than the primary heir. This was a way to avoid primogeniture inheritance, or to ensure it in cases where the estate would be partitioned among heiresses when there is no son to inherit. While the use was intact, the occupant of the land could take advantage of the cestui que use to avoid the feudal payments and duties (incidents). Incidents such as wardship, marriage penalties and other gifts, taxes, fines, fees, and knight service were onerous. This was particularly true of wardship, because most other feudal dues had fallen from practice by the late Middle Ages. Common law did not recognize cestui que uses as such, and there was difficulty fitting these cases into the existing writs and case law. By the mid-fifteenth century most of the cases at Chancery, which dealt with equity law, involved land use. The incidents could not be enforced against a person who was on a Crusade, or other war, or business adventure. They were not present in the kingdom to be enforced to perform. Since the feudal oath was to the person, and not the land, there could be no lien against the land. A hallmark of medieval feudalism was the person to person oath of allegiance. The feudal incidents could not be enforced upon the beneficiaries of the cestui que use, since these were not the owners of the land. The users had not sworn an oath to the lord. Therefore, they owed the lord nothing. The cestui que use had no estate. They had no seisin, nor a trespass, and therefore, ejectment could not be effected. These required possession. Assumpsit was of no avail. In 1402, the Commons had petitioned the king for a remedy against dishonest feoffees to uses, apparently with no result. Cestui que use became a new kind of property and property use.Holdsworth, W.; pp. 410–411  Henry VII  Concerted efforts were made under Henry VII of England to reform cestui que. A change in the laws made feoffees the absolute owners of the property of which they had been enfeoffed, and they became subject to all the liabilities of ownership. They were the only ones who could take proceedings against those who interfered with their ownership. If a trespass had been committed with the license of the cestui que use they could take proceedings against him, for he was at law only a tenant at sufferance. Similarly, feoffees were the only ones who could take the proceedings against tenants of the land to compel them to perform their obligations.Year Book 10 Henry VII, Pasch. pl. 12Year Book 5 Henry VII, Hil. pl 4S. C. Henry VII, Mich. pl. 18Holdsworth, pp. 427–430 If a debt was brought for rent by a cestui que use, and the defendant pleaded \\"nihil habuit tempore dimissions\\", the plaintiff would have lost his action if he had not made a special replication setting out the facts.Year Book 2 Henry VII Mich pl. 18 The purpose of these changes was to make cestui que in general, and cestui que use trusts more cumbersome and economically unattractive. Henry VIII  St. Mary's Abbey, York, a Benedictine monastery dissolved by Henry VIII in 1539 Henry VIII sought to end all cestui que uses and regain the incidents (fees and payments) that had been deprived him. Thomas Cromwell and Audley who succeeded Thomas More vigorously crushed cestui que uses in the courts, persuading judges to declare them illegal or void.Re: Lord Decre of the South, 1535 By 1538–39, over 800 religious land holdings had been returned to the Crown. Many of these were subsequently sold, converted to private dwellings, given to loyal supporters of the English Reformation, dismantled for building materials, or abandoned and allowed to degenerate into ruins. Claims of religious corruption were frequently used to justify reclamation by the Crown. Since many of these religious orders provided charity, much of the local medical and social services were left in disarray. (see: Dissolution of the Monasteries, List of monasteries dissolved by Henry VIII of England) =Statute of Uses = The Statute of Uses was enacted in 1535, and was intended to end the \\"abuses\\" which had incurred in cestui que use. It declared that any holder of a cestui que use became the holder of the legal title of the ownership in fee simple. This voided the advantages of a cestui que use. The feoffee to uses was bypassed. The cestui que use had seisin. Henry VIII of England got his incidences back. The land owner lost the ability to will the land to heirs other than those in direct lineage. There could be no bypassing of heirs with a cestui que. This condition was modified in the Statute of Wills (1540). One of the effects of the Statute of Uses in executing the use, was to make a mere sale of land without feoffment (the formal public transfer) effective to pass the legal estate. The buyer became the owner by operation of the statute. It necessitated a public announcement of the intended sale to determine if the land had been surreptitiously sold to someone else. The Statute of Uses required a public registry of sale of land, later called the Statute of Enrollments.Roebuck, Derek, \\"The Background of the Common Law\\" Oxford, 1990 pp. 78–80 Lawyers quickly determined that adding the words to a conveyance \\"land to Leonard and his heirs, to the use of John and his heirs, to the use of Kenneth and his heirs.\\" For a time, this device defeated the intent of the Statute of Uses. Lord Hardwicke wrote that the Statute had no real effect other than to add, at most three words, to a conveyance. He was referring to the doctrine that had become settled before his time: that the old use might still be effected despite the Statute, by a \\"use on a use\\".Hopkins v. Hopkins, 1 Atk. 580, 591, 1783 The Statute of Uses had been considered a great failure. It did not wipe out double ownership, legal and equitable, which has survived into the modern system of trusts. The preamble of the Statute went far in enumerating the abuses the system of uses had brought into play. The Statute did not, as had previously been suggested, try to remedy these abuses by declaring any uses void. It merely declared that the possession should be transferred to the use and that the cestui que use should have the possession after such manner and form as he had before the use.Holdsworth, vol. 4 pp. 455–456, 578Percy Bordwell, \\"The Repeal of the Statute of Uses\\", Harv L. Rev. 39, 466–484, 1926 = In Re Chudleigh's Case = In Re Chudleigh's Case was the first application of the Statute of Uses, and occurred fifty years after its enactment. This case was argued several times in front of several courts in England. It has been described as a judicial scrutiny of \\"use on a use\\".Percy Bordwell, \\"Seisin and Disseisin\\", 34 Harv. L. Rev. 592, 599, 1921 Francis Bacon argued for the defense. The case is replete with desultory and curious discussion which, in the opinion of Lord Hardwicke, is difficult to understand. The disposition and policy of the judges was to check contingent uses, which they deemed to be productive of mischiefs and tending to perpetuities. They regarded the Statute of Uses as intending to extirpate uses, which were often found to be subtle and fraudulent contrivances. Their evident object was to restore the simplicity and integrity of the common law.In Re Chudleigh's Case 1 Co. Rep. 1136, 76 Eng. Rep. 261 K. B. 1594; also reported in 1 Co. 120, 1 Anderson 309 The great controversy in Chudleigh's case was whether the Statute of Uses had reduced the feoffee to uses to a mere conduit pipe through which possession passed to the cestui que use, or whether he still retained some of the old powers he had before the Statute of Uses. What the majority judges sought in the case was just what the projectors of the present property reform in England were after, the free alienability of land. Chudleigh's Case became known as the Case of Perpetuities. The case turned on the doctrine of scintilla juris which Bacon called metaphysics of the worst kind. Scintilla juris (Latin: a spark of right), is a legal fiction allowing feoffees to uses to support contingent uses when they come into existence, thereby to enable the Statute of Uses to execute them.27 Henry VIII4 Kent's Com. 238 et seq Chudleigh's Case represented the turning point of the old medieval common law of cestui que uses, and the trend toward modernity. Bacon suggested that Justice Coke had \\"ripped uses from their cradle.\\" 7 Bacon, 617, 618  United States cases  =Town of Pawlet v. Clark (1815) = In the 1815 case of Town of Pawlet v. ClarkTown of Pawlet v. Clark, 13 US (9 Cranch) 292, 1815 the United States Supreme Court found that a Royal grant of land to the Church of England in the colony of New Hampshire was not completed. The grant had been made prior to the American Revolutionary War, and the State of Vermont, as successor to the English Crown, could claim the land and convey it to the town of Pawlet for schools. The cestui que nature of the trust which held the land was found to be void. The Episcopal Church in the town had no right or title to the land. =Terrett v. Taylor (1815) = In the 1815 case of Terrett v. Taylor,Terrett v. Taylor, 13 US (9 Cranch) 43, 1815 the United States Supreme Court found that the State of Virginia could not expropriate property of the formerly established Episcopal Church or abolish its incorporation. At issue was a land grant which was given in deed of bargain and sale on September 18, 1770 by the direction of the then vestry of the church. The land had been conveyed to Townsend Dade and James Wren, both of the county and 44 other church wardens, and to their successors in office in a form of cestui que for the use and benefit of the said church in the said parish. = Society for Propagation of the Gospel v. Town of New Haven (1823)= The 1823 case of Society for the Propagation of the Gospel v. Town of New Haven21 US (* Wheat.) 464, 1832 looked at the issue of lands granted to an English corporate body, the \\"Society\\" which had a religious purpose. The land had been granted by George III of England in New Hampshire in 1761. It was held in corporation by a form of cestui que. On October 30, 1794, the State of Vermont passed a statute whereby the land of the Society would be appropriated by the state. The Supreme Court was divided in its opinion. It ruled that the property of English corporations at the time of the Revolution were protected by the Treaty of Peace, 1783.8 Stat. 83 See Treaty of Paris (1783), Treaty of Versailles (1783) There could be no confiscations of such corporate holdings or lands because of the treaty. = Beatty v. Kurtz (1829) = In the 1829 case of Beatty v. KurtzBeatty v. Kurtz, 27 US (2 Pet.) 566, 1829 the United States Supreme Court decided the issue of title in an unincorporated Lutheran Church land. The land had been used as a cemetery. The fact that the land was held by a non-corporation was deficient at law. Nevertheless, equity permitted settlement of the title in the favor of the church organization out of religious sensitivity and sensibility. There should be sentiments for the kindred of the deceased. =Goesele v. Bimeler (1852) = A group of German separatists settled land in Ohio. The lands were held in community, and there was a renunciation of individual property. All crops and goods were donated to the community. Later the community formally incorporated, using the terms of the previous unincorporated association. The nature of the holding was in the form of a traditional cestui que use. The heirs of a deceased member of the Society of Separatists sued, seeking a portion of the lands held in community. In Goesele v. Bimeler,Goesele v. Bimeler, 55 US (14 How.) 589 1852, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the descendant heirs of the deceased member could not recover.  United States case law of recovery from disseisee in cestui que In a few American jurisdictions the grantee from one whose land is adversely held is still precluded from maintaining an action in his own name to oust the adverse possessor.Farrington v.

The common law rule may be stated, \\"No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the date of the creation of the interest.\\" Gray, \\"Rule Against Perpetuities, Fourth Edition\\", Little, Brown & Co. Boston, 1942 p. 191 Vesting indicates a right to an interest in the trust. The rule is directed entirely against remoteness in vesting. An identification of the person whose interest is defined by the trust, must either vest or fail in a specified time. Any interest which may remain contingent beyond the period of the rule is invalid.Moody, Rossen and Sogg \\"Smith's Review, Wills, Trusts, Probate, Administration and the Fiduciary, Third Edition\\", West, 1982, p. 174 A beneficiary must be an identifiable person born within the time span of the trust, and vest in it. All interests in a charitable trust, are subject to the rule with a few exceptions. A charitable trust which gives a gift from the first charity to a second charity on a condition precedent is not void by reason of the fact that the condition may not occur without the period of the Rule. (See Example 2 below.) Property transferred from a non-charity and then left over to a second charity on a remote contingency is void. (See Example 3 below.) =Examples of the rule against perpetuities= Example 1: Alex leaves property in trust to Bill to hold for the benefit of Alex's children during their lives and on the death of the last survivor of Alex's children, to distribute the principle to Alex's grandchildren then living. At Alex's death he has three children living, C1, C2 and C3. It is certain that the remainder to the grandchildren will vest at the death of one of the three whose life will span both the time of the creation of the interest (Alex's death) and the vesting interest of the interest (his own death). It is unnecessary to determine whether it will be C1, C2 or C3. Example 2: Alphonse leaves property to Brandon in a trust to pay the income to St. John's Church, located in Anytown, so long as it conducts its regular services in accordance with the Book of Common Prayer, 1789 Version. If at any time it should discontinue this practice, then the trust income reverts to St. Matthew's Church. This is a valid contingency. Example 3: Beth leaves property in trust to hold for Mary's children for life and on the death of Mary's last surviving child, the property reverts to Mary's living female grandchildren. If no female grandchild is living, then the property reverts to the Cathedral School for Girls. Mary is living at the time of Beth's death. The gift to the Cathedral School is void. Example 4: Albert leaves property to Thomas in trust to pay the income to St. Mark's Church so long as it conducts its regular services in accordance with the Book of Common Prayer, 1789 Version. If at any time in the future, it should discontinue to so conduct its services in such a manner, the income passes to Robert, or Robert's heirs then living. The gift over is void because it may remain contingent for a period longer than the rule against perpetuities. It makes no difference that it is preceded by a gift to charity. Example 5: Martin leaves property to Joseph in trust to hold for the benefit of St. Vincent's Church if it should adopt a new liturgy proposed by the religious convention held in 1970. The gift is void. The contingency may not occur within the period of the Rule. There is no exception for a gift to charity under such circumstances. =Wait and see rule= The \\"wait and see rule\\" was instituted to eliminate or mitigate the harsh effect of the common law rule against perpetuities. Under this doctrine, the court decides the validity of future estates only at the time the prior estate terminates and then tests whether the interest violates the rule by the events which have actually happened rather than the possibilities existing at the time the interest was created.Merchant's National Bank v. Curtis, 98 NH, 97 A 2nd 207 (1953) =Cy-près rule = Cy-près doctrine was also instituted to mitigate the harshness of the common law rule against perpetuities. Cy-près means \\"as near as possible\\" or \\"as close as possible\\". Cy-près allows the court to reform the interest within the limits of the rule to approximate most closely the intention of the creator of the interest. Both wait-and-see and cy-près approaches have been adopted by the American Law Institute as to the traditional rule against perpetuities.Restatement, Second, Property sections 104–105 (Tentative Draft No. 2, 1979)Leach, \\"Perpetuities: The Nutshell Revisited\\", 78 Harv.

The rates were used to meet the costs of carrying on divine service, repairing the fabric of the church and paying the salaries of the connected officials. Except for a brief period during the Commonwealth of England in the 17th century, the raising of Church Rates has never been confirmed by statute. It was always a matter of 'Common Law'. The compulsory levying of the church rate was abolished by statute in 1868; however, it remains on a voluntary basis in many parishes. Chancel repair liability in England however remains enforceable by law. History The church rates were set by the churchwardens together with the parishioners, who were duly assembled after proper notice had been posted in the church vestry or the church. The rates thus set were recoverable in the ecclesiastical court, or, if the arrears did not exceed £10 and no questions were raised as to the legal liability, before two justices of the peace. Any payment made out of the rate which was not strictly recognised by law destroyed its validity. The church rate was a personal charge imposed on the occupier of land or of a house in the parish, and, though it was compulsory, it was often difficult to enforce: especially so in the case of Nonconformists, who had conscientious objections to supporting the Established Church; in Ireland, where the population was mostly Roman Catholic, the grievance was specially felt and resented. The objections of the Nonconformists were not only on principle. The Church of England received financial support from Parliament, while Nonconformist congregations were entirely dependent on voluntary contributions. They did not want to have to support another parish as well as their own. Enforcement of the rate was not uniform across the country. Resolutions were passed protesting against the rate, and societies to abolish the rate were formed all over the country. In 1836 at a public meeting in London, a central committee, the Church Rate Abolition Society, was formed to co-ordinate the efforts of local abolitionist Societies. In 1837, Parliament made two concessions to the Nonconformists: a more acceptable marriage ceremony, and the civil registration of births, deaths and marriages. However, the parish rate remained compulsory until 1868. The Whig leader in the House of Commons, Lord John Russell, supported the rate but in 1856 The Times called the government's attention to what the editor believed was a civil war raging throughout the country on the church rate question.J. P. Ellens: Lord John Russell and the Church Rate Conflict: The Struggle for a Broad Church, 1834–1868; (1987) The Journal of British Studies, Vol 2. pp 232–257. In 1868, the Compulsory Church Rate Abolition Act was passed. This Act made church rates no longer compulsory, but merely voluntary, with those who were not willing to pay the rate being excluded from inquiring into, objecting to or voting in respect of their expenditure. Present day Parochial church councils may continue to levy voluntary rates by virtue of the Parochial Church Councils (Powers) Measure 1956. All Church of England Churches within the City of London continue to levy the church rate. Hampstead Parish Church has documented their procedures for raising a voluntary rate, by way of good practice.

Born in a family of government officials in Xu Province, he started his career as a county chief at the age of 24 and later became an agriculture official under Tao Qian, the Governor of Xu Province. After Tao Qian's death in 194, Chen Deng supported Liu Bei to be the new Governor. However, in 196, he was forced to become a subordinate of the warlord Lü Bu after the latter seized control of Xu Province from Liu Bei. During this time, Chen Deng and his father Chen Gui pretended to be loyal towards Lü Bu, while secretly undermining his influence by dissuading him from allying with another warlord Yuan Shu. Chen Deng also secretly agreed to serve as a mole in Xu Province for the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government. Chen Deng was then appointed as the Administrator of Guangling Commandery. During the Battle of Xiapi of 198–199, Chen Deng led his troops to join Cao Cao and assisted him in defeating Lü Bu. After the victory, Chen Deng was given an additional appointment as General Who Calms the Waves. During his tenure in Guangling Commandery, he gained high popularity among the people for good and benevolent governance – to the point where the people even wanted to follow him after learning that he had been reassigned to another commandery. He also resisted two invasions by the forces of Sun Ce, a warlord who controlled territories in the Jiangnan (or Jiangdong) region. He died in an unknown year at the age of 38 due to an illness caused by intestinal parasites. Family background Chen Deng's ancestral home (and probably birthplace too) was in Huaipu County (), Xiapi Commandery (), Xu Province (), which is present-day Lianshui County, Jiangsu. He was born in a family of government officials. His granduncle, Chen Qiu (), held high-ranking positions in the Han government during the reign of Emperor Ling. Chen Qiu's sons, Chen Yu () and Chen Cong (), served as commandery administrators. Chen Deng's father, Chen Gui, was the Chancellor () of Pei State (沛國; around present-day Pei County, Jiangsu).(陳球字伯真，下邳淮浦人也。 ... 弟子珪，沛相；珪子登，廣陵太守：並知名。) Houhanshu vol. 56. Early life and career At a young age, Chen Deng was already known for his ambition to dedicate his life to serving and helping the people. He was well-read, knowledgeable and talented in literary arts. He was well-versed in both classical and contemporary writings and could apply them well to various contexts.(先賢行狀曰： ... 少有扶世濟民之志。博覽載籍，雅有文藝，舊典文章，莫不貫綜。) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. When he was 24, he was nominated as a xiaolian (civil service candidate) by the local commandery office to serve in the government and was subsequently appointed as the Chief () of Dongyang County (東陽縣; west of present-day Jinhu County, Jiangsu). During his tenure, he helped the elderly, took care of orphaned children, and treated the county residents as if they were his family.(年二十五，舉孝廉，除東陽長，養耆育孤，視民如傷。) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. Service under Tao Qian and Liu Bei When a famine broke out in Xu Province, the provincial governor Tao Qian invited Chen Deng to serve as Colonel of Agriculture (). During this time, Chen Deng surveyed the lands, assessed their suitability for growing crops, and then implemented agricultural and irrigation works accordingly. Chen Deng's efforts helped to counter the famine and ensure that there were abundant food supplies for the people.(是時世荒民饑，州牧陶謙表登為典農校尉，乃巡土田之宜，盡鑿溉之利，秔稻豐積。) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. When Tao Qian became critically ill in 194, he told his subordinate Mi Zhu: \\"No one but Liu Bei can bring peace to this province.\\" After his death, Mi Zhu invited Liu Bei to be the new Governor of Xu Province in accordance with Tao Qian's dying wish. When Liu Bei declined,(謙病篤，謂別駕麋笁曰：「非劉備不能安此州也。」謙死，笁率州人迎先主，先主未敢當。) Sanguozhi vol. 32. Chen Deng told him: When Liu Bei said Yuan Shu would be more suitable to be the Governor,(先主曰：「袁公路近在壽春，此君四世五公，海內所歸，君可以州與之。」) Sanguozhi vol. 32. Chen Deng replied: Kong Rong, the Chancellor () of Beihai State (北海國; around present-day Weifang, Shandong), also urged Liu Bei to accept the governorship. Liu Bei agreed and became the new Governor of Xu Province.(北海相孔融謂先主曰：「袁公路豈憂國忘家者邪？冢中枯骨，何足介意。今日之事，百姓與能，天與不取，悔不可追。」先主遂領徐州。) Sanguozhi vol. 32. Chen Deng also wrote to the warlord Yuan Shao, who was based in Ji Province, to inform him that Liu Bei had become the Governor of Xu Province in accordance with the people's wishes. Yuan Shao approved and remarked that Liu Bei deserved the appointment since he had the people's support.(獻帝春秋曰：陳登等遣使詣袁紹曰：「天降灾沴，禍臻鄙州，州將殂殞，生民無主，恐懼姦雄一旦承隙，以貽盟主日昃之憂，輒共奉故平原相劉備府君以為宗主，永使百姓知有依歸。方今寇難縱橫，不遑釋甲，謹遣下吏奔告于執事。」紹荅曰：「劉玄德弘雅有信義，今徐州樂戴之，誠副所望也。」) Xiandi Chunqiu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 32. Service under Lü Bu In 196, the warlord Lü Bu seized control of Xu Province from Liu Bei while the latter was away at a battle against a rival warlord Yuan Shu, who controlled parts of Yang Province to the south of Xu Province. Chen Deng and his father Chen Gui were forced to become Lü Bu's subordinates. In 197, Yuan Shu proposed forming an alliance with Lü Bu, and offered to arrange a marriage between his son and Lü Bu's daughter. Chen Gui was worried that both Yuan Shu and Lü Bu would pose a greater threat to the Han central government if they became allies, so he advised Lü Bu to avoid having any ties to Yuan Shu. He also urged Lü Bu to build friendly relations with Cao Cao, the warlord who controlled the figurehead Emperor Xian and the Han central government in the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan).(沛相陳珪恐術、布成婚，則徐、揚合從，將為國難，於是往說布曰；「曹公奉迎天子，輔讚國政，威靈命世，將征四海，將軍宜與恊同策謀，圖太山之安。今與術結婚，受天下不義之名，必有累卵之危。」) Sanguozhi vol. 7. Lü Bu heeded Chen Gui's advice and rejected Yuan Shu's offer. He also arrested Yuan Shu's messenger, Han Yin (), and sent him as a prisoner to the imperial capital Xu, where Han Yin was publicly executed. After that, Chen Gui asked Lü Bu to send Chen Deng as his representative to meet Cao Cao, but Lü Bu refused. However, after the Han central government sent an emissary to appoint Lü Bu as General of the Left (), Lü Bu was so happy that he sent Chen Deng as his representative to Xu to thank Cao Cao and the Han imperial court.(布亦怨術初不己受也，女已在塗，追還絕婚，械送韓胤，梟首許市。珪欲使子登詣太祖，布不肯遣。會使者至，拜布左將軍。布大喜，即聽登往，并令奉章謝恩。) Sanguozhi vol. 7. =Serving as a mole in Xu Province= In the imperial capital Xu, Chen Deng told Cao Cao that Lü Bu was courageous but foolhardy and untrustworthy, and advised Cao Cao to get rid of Lü Bu soon. Cao Cao replied, \\"Lü Bu has the heart of a rapacious wolf. It's really difficult to allow him to live long. You're probably the only person who understands his temperament.\\"(登見太祖，因陳布勇而無計，輕於去就，宜早圖之。太祖曰：「布，狼子野心，誠難乆養，非卿莫能究其情也。」) Sanguozhi vol. 7. He then increased Chen Gui's salary by 2,000 dan of grain and appointed Chen Deng as the Administrator () of Guangling Commandery (around present-day Huai'an, Jiangsu) in Xu Province. Before Chen Deng left, Cao Cao held his hand and said, \\"You're now in charge of the task in the east.\\" Chen Deng had agreed to serve as a mole in Xu Province and assist Cao Cao in eliminating Lü Bu.(奉使到許，太祖以登為廣陵太守，令陰合衆以圖呂布。) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7.(即增珪秩中二千石，拜登廣陵太守。臨別，太祖執登手曰：「東方之事便以相付。」令登陰合部衆以為內應。) Sanguozhi vol. 7. When Chen Deng returned to Xu Province, an angry Lü Bu confronted him, brandished his ji at him and said, \\"Your father advised me to side with Cao Cao and reject Yuan Shu's offer. Now, (after following his advice,) I have gained nothing, while you and your father got promoted and rewarded. You must have tricked me! What do you have to say?\\"(始，布因登求徐州牧，登還，布怒，拔戟斫机曰：「卿父勸吾恊同曹公，絕婚公路；今吾所求無一獲，而卿父子並顯重，為卿所賣耳！卿為吾言，其說云何？」) Sanguozhi vol. 7. Chen Deng maintained his composure and calmly replied: Lü Bu's anger subsided.(布意乃解。) Sanguozhi vol. 7. =Governing Guangling Commandery= After assuming office as the Administrator of Guangling Commandery, Chen Deng governed his jurisdiction fairly and justly and built up a good reputation. He also managed to induce Xue Zhou (), a pirate leader, to lead thousands of his followers to surrender to the local government. Within the first year of his governorship, Chen Deng's policies yielded good results in Guangling Commandery and earned him the respect and love of the commandery's residents. Chen Deng remarked, \\"This can be put to good use.\\"(登在廣陵，明審賞罰，威信宣布。海賊薛州之羣萬有餘戶，束手歸命。未及期年，功化以就，百姓畏而愛之。登曰：「此可用矣。」) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. =Battle of Xiapi= In 198, Cao Cao led his forces to attack Lü Bu at Xiapi (下邳; present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu), the capital of Xu Province. Chen Deng responded by leading troops from Guangling Commandery to assist Cao Cao in attacking Lü Bu. At the time, as Chen Deng's three younger brothers were in Xiapi, Lü Bu held them hostage and threatened to kill them if Chen Deng did not make peace with him. Chen Deng refused to start peace talks with Lü Bu, and ordered his troops to press on the attack on Xiapi. During the battle, Zhang Hong (), an officer under Lü Bu, sensed that Lü Bu would eventually lose and became afraid that he would get into trouble, so he secretly freed Chen Deng's brothers at night and brought them out of Xiapi to join Chen Deng. Lü Bu eventually lost the battle against Cao Cao, and was captured and executed.(太祖到下邳，登率郡兵為軍先驅。時登諸弟在下邳城中，布乃質執登三弟，欲求和同。登執意不撓，進圍日急。布刺姦張弘，懼於後累，夜將登三弟出就登。布旣伏誅， ...) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. Resisting Sun Ce's attacks After defeating Lü Bu, Cao Cao suggested to the Han central government to grant Chen Deng an additional appointment, General Who Calms the Waves (), in addition to his existing appointment as the Administrator of Guangling Commandery. At the time, Chen Deng was highly popular among the people living in the Jianghuai region (covering parts of present-day Anhui and Jiangsu). During this time, he came up with the idea of conquering the Jiangnan (or Jiangdong) region,(登以功加拜伏波將軍，甚得江、淮間歡心，於是有吞滅江南之志。) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. which at the time was under the control of the warlord Sun Ce. =Battle of Kuangqi= Sometime between early 199 and the summer of 200, Sun Ce sent his forces to attack Chen Deng at Kuangqi (), a fortress in Guangling Commandery. When Chen Deng's subordinates saw that Sun Ce's invading forces outnumbered the defending troops in Guangling Commandery by more than ten times, they became fearful and worried that they could not resist the enemy. They advised Chen Deng to evacuate everyone in Kuangqi and retreat further inland away from the riverbank, and hoped that some days later Sun Ce's forces would retreat on their own, return to their boats and sail back to Jiangnan.(孫策遣軍攻登於匡琦城。賊初到，旌甲覆水，羣下咸以今賊衆十倍於郡兵，恐不能抗，可引軍避之，與其空城。水人居陸，不能乆處，必尋引去。) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. Chen Deng gave a stern response: He then ordered his troops to shut the gates, hold up inside the fortress and refrain from engaging Sun Ce's forces in battle. Everyone laid low and remained silent until the entire fortress seemed as though it were empty.(乃閉門自守，示弱不與戰，將士銜聲，寂若無人。) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. Chen Deng quietly observed the situation outside the fortress and saw that it was possible to defeat Sun Ce's forces. He then ordered his troops to get into position and ready themselves for battle. When the opportunity came, he opened the south gates of the fortress and led his troops out to attack the enemy camp and block them from retreating back to their boats at the riverbank. Sun Ce's forces, led by Zhou Zhang (), got into battle formation to fight back. Chen Deng then ordered his troops to launch a fierce attack on Sun Ce's forces while he beat a war drum to boost his men's morale. They scored a great victory over Sun Ce's forces, who abandoned their boats and fled. Chen Deng led his men to pursue the retreating enemy soldiers and killed thousands of them.(登乘城望形勢，知其可擊，乃申令將士，宿整兵器，昧爽，開南門，引軍指賊營，步騎鈔其後。賊周章方結陣，不得還舩。登手執軍鼓，縱兵乘之，賊遂大破，皆棄舩迸走。登乘勝追奔，斬虜以萬數。) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. After losing the first battle, Sun Ce gathered more troops and prepared to launch another attack on Chen Deng. As Chen Deng knew that Sun Ce's forces would attack again, he sent one of his subordinates, Chen Jiao, to ask for reinforcements from Cao Cao. At the same time, he also ordered his men to go to a military camp about 10 li away from the fortress, neatly arrange piles of firewood in rows and columns with a spacing of ten steps, and set them on fire at night. In the meantime, he ordered his troops in the fortress to pretend to celebrate on top of the walls, so as to trick Sun Ce's forces into thinking that Cao Cao's reinforcements had arrived.(賊忿喪軍，尋復大興兵向登。登以兵不敵，使功曹陳矯求救於太祖。登密去城十里治軍營處所，令多取柴薪，兩束一聚，相去十步，從橫成行，令夜俱起火，火然其聚。城上稱慶，若大軍到。) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. As Chen Deng expected, Sun Ce's forces were shocked to see the brightly lit camp and thought that Cao Cao's reinforcements had arrived. Chen Deng then took advantage of their confusion and led his troops to attack them, scoring yet another major victory and killing thousands of enemy soldiers.(賊望火驚潰，登勒兵追奔，斬首萬級。) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. =Inducing Yan Baihu to cause trouble for Sun Ce= In the summer of 200, Sun Ce led his forces to attack Huang Zu at Jiangxia Commandery in Jing Province. At the time, Chen Deng was at Sheyang County (射陽縣; east of present-day Baoying County, Jiangsu) and he wanted to take revenge against Sun Ce for attacking his relative Chen Yu (), the Administrator of Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu), and seizing Wu Commandery from him in 197. He then induced the bandit leader Yan Baihu to cause trouble for Sun Ce in his home territories in Jiangdong while Sun Ce was away at Jiangxia Commandery.(江表傳曰：廣陵太守陳登治射陽，登即瑀之從兄子也。策前西征，登陰復遣間使，以印綬與嚴白虎餘黨，圖為後害，以報瑀見破之辱。) Jiang Biao Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 46. After Sun Ce returned to Jiangdong, he planned to retaliate against Chen Deng and launch an attack on Sheyang County. However, he had to wait at Dantu County (丹徒縣; in present-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) because his troops ran out of supplies. During this time, he went on a hunting excursion and was ambushed and assassinated by the retainers of Xu Gong, a commandery administrator he killed earlier.(策歸，復討登。軍到丹徒，須待運糧。策性好獵，將步騎數出。策驅馳逐鹿，所乘馬精駿，從騎絕不能及。 ... 獵日，卒有三人即貢客也。 ... 餘二人怖急，便舉弓射策，中頰。後騎尋至，皆刺殺之。) Jiang Biao Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 46. Reassignment to Dongcheng The Han central government later reassigned Chen Deng to be the Administrator () of Dongcheng Commandery (東城郡; around present- day Mingguang, Anhui). As Chen Deng was highly popular among the residents of Guangling Commandery, many of them wanted to leave Guangling and follow him to Dongcheng Commandery when they heard that he had been reassigned there. Chen Deng stopped them and said, \\"When I was the Administrator of Guangling Commandery, I was lucky enough to be able to repel invasions from Wu. Why should you worry that you won't get a better Administrator after me?\\"(遷登為東城太守。廣陵吏民佩其恩德，共拔郡隨登，老弱繈負而追之。登曉語令還，曰：「太守在卿郡，頻致吳寇，幸而克濟。諸卿何患無令君乎？」) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. Death Chen Deng became affected by an illness with symptoms such as a feeling of stuffiness in his chest, facial redness, and loss of appetite. The physician Hua Tuo came to treat him, took his pulse and said, \\"Sir, there are several sheng of parasites in your stomach and you're on the verge of developing an ulcer. This is caused by the consumption of raw food.\\" He then prepared two sheng of a decoction for Chen Deng and told him to drink one sheng first and finish the remainder a while later. Within a span of time needed to have a meal, Chen Deng vomited up three sheng or more of wriggling parasites with red heads. Half of their bodies looked like raw fish slices. He was immediately relieved of his discomfort. Hua Tuo told him, \\"This illness will affect you again after three years. If you have a good physician to attend to you, then you will be fine.\\" Three years later, Chen Deng experienced the same illness again. However, as Hua Tuo was not around at the time to heal him, Chen Deng died of his illness.(廣陵太守陳登得病，胷中煩懣，靣赤不食。佗脉之曰：「府君胃中有蟲數升，欲成內疽，食腥物所為也。」即作湯二升，先服一升，斯須盡服之。食頃，吐出三升許蟲，赤頭皆動，半身是生魚膾也，所苦便愈。佗曰：「此病後三期當發，遇良醫乃可濟救。」依期果發動，時佗不在，如言而死。) Sanguozhi vol. 29. He was 38 (or 39 by East Asian age reckoning) at the time of his death.(陳登者，字元龍，在廣陵有威名。又掎角呂布有功，加伏波將軍，年三十九卒。) Sanguozhi vol. 7. Post- mortem events After Sun Ce died in 200, his younger brother Sun Quan succeeded him as the warlord ruling over the Jiangnan (or Jiangdong) territories to the south of the Yangtze. Whenever Cao Cao came to the north banks of the Yangtze, he sighed and regretted not heeding Chen Deng's earlier advice to attack the Jiangdong territories. His failure to heed Chen Deng's advice had allowed the Sun family to gain a strong foothold in the region and pose a threat to him.(孫權遂跨有江外。太祖每臨大江而歎，恨不早用陳元龍計，而令封豕養其爪牙。) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. Sometime in the Three Kingdoms period, Cao Cao's son Cao Pi, who became the first emperor of the Cao Wei state, decided to posthumously honour Chen Deng for his contributions during the late Eastern Han dynasty. He appointed Chen Deng's son, Chen Su (), as a Gentleman Cadet ().(文帝追美登功，拜登息肅為郎中。) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. Appraisal The Xianxian Xingzhuang () recorded that Chen Deng was known for his loyalty, forthrightness, virtuous character, and for being a resourceful, astute and deep-thinking strategist.(先賢行狀曰：登忠亮高爽，沈深有大略， ...) Xianxian Xingzhuang annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. Xu Si (), Liu Bei and Liu Biao once had a discussion on famous persons of their time. When they talked about Chen Deng, Xu Si said, \\"Chen Yuanlong has a bold and uninhibited personality. He just couldn't help being so forthright.\\"(後許汜與劉備並在荊州牧劉表坐，表與備共論天下人，汜曰：「陳元龍湖海之士，豪氣不除。」) Sanguozhi vol. 7. When Liu Bei asked Liu Biao whether he agreed with what Xu Si said, Liu Biao replied, \\"If I say he's wrong, then I'm probably wrong too because I know (Xu Si) is a good gentleman who won't say untrue things about others. If I say he's right, Yuanlong would become even more famous.\\"(備謂表曰：「許君論是非？」表曰：「欲言非，此君為善士，不宜虛言；欲言是，元龍名重天下。」) Sanguozhi vol. 7. Liu Bei then turned to Xu Si and asked him if he had anything to support his claim that Chen Deng was too forthright. Xu Si replied, \\"During those times of chaos, I passed by Xiapi and visited Yuanlong. Yuanlong didn't behave like a gracious host as he not only didn't greet me, but also made me, a guest, sleep on a lower bed while he slept on a higher bed.\\"(備問汜：「君言豪，寧有事邪？」汜曰：「昔遭亂過下邳，見元龍。元龍無客主之意，乆不相與語，自上大牀卧，使客卧下牀。」) Sanguozhi vol. 7. Liu Bei then told Xu Si, \\"Sir, you have the reputation of a guoshi. Now, the Han Empire is in a state of chaos and the Emperor has been displaced. Everyone hopes that you, Sir, will show concern and do something to save the Han Empire. However, what you did was to ask Yuanlong to provide you land and shelter, and you didn't suggest any ideas to him in return. He hated this kind of behaviour the most, so why should you even expect him to speak to you? If I were him, I'd definitely sleep at the top level of a tower and make you sleep on the ground level. He was kind enough to not distance himself further away from you.\\"(備曰：「君有國士之名，今天下大亂，帝主失所，望君憂國忘家，有救世之意，而君求田問舍，言無可采，是元龍所諱也，何緣當與君語？如小人，欲卧百尺樓上，卧君於地，何但上下牀之閒邪？」) Sanguozhi vol. 7. Liu Biao laughed when he heard that. Liu Bei then said, \\"Heroes who are as versatile, courageous and ambitious as Yuanlong can only be found in history. It's very hard to find someone like him in this day and age.\\"(表大笑。備因言曰：「若元龍文武膽志，當求之於古耳，造次難得比也。」) Sanguozhi vol. 7. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Chen Deng appears as a minor character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the historical figures and events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. Although the fictionalised Chen Deng in the novel is generally similar to his historical counterpart, the novel exaggerates and focuses more on the roles played by him and his father Chen Gui in Lü Bu's downfall. The novel also includes a fictitious account of him helping Liu Bei seize control of Xu Province from Che Zhou (), and advising Liu Bei on how to deal with Cao Cao before the Battle of Guandu.Sanguo Yanyi chs. 11, 12, 16. 17, 19, 21, 22, 24.

Early years Perrin was born on September 18, 1927 in New York City and grew up in Pelham Manor, New York. His parents both worked as advertising copywriters at the J. Walter Thompson Agency. His mother Blanche was a career writer and the author of several novels, and she was his inspiration to become a writer. Perrin was educated at the Woodberry Forest School in Orange, Virginia, and later at Williams College where he majored in English Literature and graduated in 1949. He received a master's degree from Duke University in 1950, then served in the Army. During the Korean War, he served as a forward observer in a field artillery unit and was awarded the Bronze Star. Teaching and writing career Perrin taught English literature at the Woman's College of the University of North Carolina from 1956 to 1959. He further studied at Cambridge University, where he received a Master's of Literature degree in 1958. He joined the Dartmouth faculty in 1959 as an instructor in English, reaching the rank of full professor by 1970. He specialized in teaching modern poetry, particularly that of Robert Frost. He was a Fulbright professor at Warsaw University in Poland in 1970, and was twice a Guggenheim Fellow. He joined Dartmouth's Environmental Studies Program in 1984 as an Adjunct Professor, teaching courses on a range of subjects. Perrin wrote essays for many publications and was a regular contributor to the Washington Post for more than 20 years, covering a wide variety of subjects. His Washington Post essays later were published as A Reader's Delight (1988), one of his 12 books. His later Washington Post columns about forgotten works of children's literature were collected in A Child's Delight (1997). His second book was Dr. Bowdler's Legacy: A History of Expurgated Books in England and America (1969) and was nominated for the National Book Award. His sixth book was Giving up the Gun: Japan's Reversion to the Sword, 1543–1879. In 1963, Perrin bought a farm in Thetford Center, Vermont which served him as home and grist for six books, including First Person Rural: Essays of a Sometime Farmer (1978). He often wrote essays about rural life in a fashion similar to the poems of Will Carleton. \\"He reveled in the rural life,\\" said writer Reeve Lindbergh, whose sister was Anne Lindbergh, elder daughter of Charles Lindbergh and Perrin's third wife. Interest in environmental matters Perrin's interest in environmental matters, including alternative energy sources, led him to purchase an electric car in 1990. He recounted his adventures driving his converted Ford Escort from the builder in California home to Vermont in Solo: Life with an Electric Car (1992). One advantage of the car proved to be a rare reserved parking spot on campus—with its own electrical outlet. Perrin later put a solar panel array on his barn roof. Perrin once wrote to a friend: \\"I currently spend half my time teaching at Dartmouth, half farming and half writing. That this adds up to three halves I am all too aware.\\" Perrin, who suffered from Shy–Drager syndrome, died at his farmhouse on November 21, 2004.

In historiography, the Warlord Era began in 1916 upon the death of Yuan Shikai, the de facto dictator of China after the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China in 1912. Yuan's death created a power vacuum that spread across the Mainland China regions of Sichuan, Shanxi, Qinghai, Ningxia, Guangdong, Guangxi, Gansu, Yunnan and Xinjiang. The Nationalist Kuomintang government of Sun Yat-sen based in Guangzhou began to contest Yuan's Beiyang Government based in Beijing as the legitimate government of China. The Warlord Era was characterized by constant civil war between different factions, the largest of which was the Central Plains War which involved more than one million soldiers. The Warlord Era ended in 1928 when the Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek officially unified China through the Northern Expedition, marking the beginning of the Nanjing decade. Several of the warlords continued to maintain their influence through the 1930s and the 1940s, which was problematic for the Nationalist government during both the Second Sino-Japanese War and Chinese Civil War.  Terminology  During World War One the New Culture Movement leader Chen Duxiu introduced the term Junfa (軍閥), taken from the Japanese gunbatsu, which was taken in turn from the German. It was not widely used until the 1920s, when it was taken up by left- wing groups to excoriate local militarists.  Origins  The Beiyang Army in training The origins of the armies and leaders which dominated politics after 1912 lay in the military reforms of the late Qing dynasty. During the Taiping Rebellion (1850–64), the Qing dynasty was forced to allow provincial governors to raise their own armies, the Yong Ying, to fight against the Taiping rebels; many of these provincial forces were not disbanded after the Taiping rebellion was over, like Li Hongzhang’s Huai Army.Henry McAleavy, \\"China Under The Warlords, Part I.\\" History Today (Apr 1962) 12#4 pp 227-233; and \\"Part II\\" (May 1962) , 12#5 pp 303-311. Strong bonding, family ties and respectful treatment of troops were emphasized.Maochun Yu, \\"The Taiping Rebellion: A Military Assessment of Revolution and Counterrevolution\\", in A Military History of China 149 (David A. Graff & Robin Higham eds., 2002) The officers were never rotated, and the soldiers were handpicked by their commanders, and commanders by their generals, so personal bonds of loyalty formed between local officers and the troops, unlike Green Standard and Banner forces.Kwang- ching Liu, Richard J. Smith, \\"The Military Challenge: The North-west and the Coast\\", in These late Qing reforms did not establish a national army but instead they mobilized regional armies and militias that had neither standardization nor consistency. Officers were loyal to their superiors and formed cliques based upon their place of origins and background. Units were composed of men from the same province. This policy was meant to reduce dialectal miscommunication, but had the side effect of encouraging regionalistic tendencies. Although the post-Taiping Rebellion governors are generally not recognised as the direct predecessors of the warlords, their combined military-civil authority and somewhat greater powers as compared to earlier governors provided a model for Republic-era provincial leaders. The fragmentation of military power due to the Late Qing's lack of a unified military force, exacerbated by the rise of provincialism during the revolution, was also a strong factor behind the proliferation of warlords. Apart from administrative and financial obstacles, the late Qing government seemed to have relied on this divided military structure to maintain political control. The Confucian disdain for the military was swept aside by the rising necessity of military professionalism, with scholars becoming heavily militarized, and many officers from non-scholarly backgrounds rising to high command and even high office in civil bureaucracy. At this time, the military upstaged the civil service. Influenced by German and Japanese ideas of military predominance over the nation, coupled with the absence of national unity amongst the various cliques in the officer class, led to the fragmentation of power in the warlord era. The most powerful regional army was the northern-based Beiyang Army under Yuan Shikai, which received the best in training and modern weaponry.Patrick Fuliang Shan, Yuan Shikai: A Reappraisal (The University of British Columbia Press, 2018, ) The Xinhai Revolution in 1911 brought widespread mutiny across southern China. The revolution began in October 1911 with the mutiny of troops based in Wuchang (Present-day Wuhan). Soldiers once loyal to the Qing government began to defect to the opposition. These revolutionary forces established a provisional government in Nanjing the following year under Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who had returned from his long exile to lead the revolution. It became clear that the revolutionaries were not strong enough to defeat the Beiyang army and continued fighting would almost certainly lead to defeat. Instead, Sun negotiated with Beiyang commander Yuan Shikai to bring an end to the Qing and reunify China. In return, Sun would hand over his presidency and recommend Yuan to be the president of the new republic. Yuan refused to move to Nanjing and insisted on maintaining the capital in Beijing, where his power base was secure. Reacting to Yuan's growing authoritarianism, the southern provinces rebelled in 1913 but were effectively crushed by Beiyang forces. Civil governors were replaced by military ones. In December 1915 Yuan made clear his intentions to become emperor of China and found a new dynasty. The southern provinces rebelled again in the National Protection War; but this time the situation was far more serious because most Beiyang commanders refused to recognize the monarchy. Yuan renounced his plans for restoring the monarchy to woo back his lieutenants, but by the time he died in June 1916 China was fractured politically. The North-South split would persist throughout the entire Warlord Era.  Warlord political system  Yuan Shikai cut back on many government institutions in the beginning of 1914 by suspending parliament, followed by the provincial assemblies. His cabinet soon resigned, effectively making Yuan dictator of China. After Yuan Shikai curtailed many basic freedoms, the country quickly spiraled into chaos and entered a period of warlordism. \\"Warlordism did not substitute military force for the other elements of government; it merely balanced them differently. This shift in balance came partly from the disintegration of the sanctions and values of China's traditional civil government.\\" In other words, during the warlord era, there was a characteristic shift from a state-dominated civil bureaucracy held by a central authority to a military-dominated culture held by many groups, with power shifting from warlord to warlord. A notable theme of warlordism is identified by C. Martin Wilbur. \\"He pointed out that a great majority of regional militarists were 'static', that is to say that their principal aim was to secure and maintain control of a particular tract of territory.\\" Warlords, in the words of American political scientist Lucian Pye, were \\"instinctively suspicious, quick to suspect that their interests might be threatened, hard-headed, devoted to the short run and impervious to idealistic abstractions\\". These Chinese warlords usually came from strict military background, and were brutal in their treatment toward both their soldiers and the general population. In 1921, the North China Daily News reported that in the Shaanxi province, prevalence of robbery and violent crimes were serious and frightened the farmers. Wu Peifu of the Zhili clique was known for suppressing strikes by railroad workers by terrorizing them with execution. A British diplomat in Sichuan province witnessed two mutineers being publicly hacked to death with their hearts and livers hung out; another two being publicly burned to death; while others had slits cut into their bodies into which were inserted burning candles before they were hacked to pieces. Zhang Zuolin (left) and Wu Peifu (right), two of the most powerful strongmen of the Warlord Era Warlords placed great stress on personal loyalty, yet subordinate officers often betrayed their commanders in exchange for bribes known as \\"silver bullets\\", and warlords often betrayed allies. Promotion had little to do with competence, and instead warlords attempted to create an interlocking network of familial, institutional, regional, and master-pupil relationships together with membership in sworn brotherhoods and secret societies. Subordinates who betrayed their commanders could suffer harshly. In November 1925 Guo Songling, the leading general loyal to Marshal Zhang Zuolin—the \\"Old Marshal\\" of Manchuria—made a deal with Feng Yuxiang to revolt, which nearly toppled the \\"Old Marshal\\", who had to promise his rebel soldiers a pay increase; that, together with signs that the Japanese still supported Zhang, caused them to go back on their loyalty to him. Guo and his wife were both publicly shot and their bodies left to hang for three days in a marketplace in Mukden. After Feng betrayed his ally Wu to seize Beijing for himself, Wu complained that China was \\"a country without a system; anarchy and treason prevail everywhere. Betraying one's leader has become as natural as eating one's breakfast ...\\" \\"Alignment politics\\" prevented any one warlord from dominating the system. When one warlord started to become too powerful, the rest would ally to stop him, then turn on each other. The level of violence in the first years was restrained, as no leader wanted to engage in too much serious fighting. War brought the risk of damage to one's own forces. For example, when Wu Peifu defeated the army of Zhang Zuolin, he provided two trains to take his defeated enemies home, knowing that if in the future Zhang were to defeat him, he could count on the same courtesy. Furthermore, none of the warlords had the economic capacity or the logistical strength to inflict a decisive knockout blow; the most they could hope for was to gain some territory. None could conquer the whole country and impose a central authority. However, as the 1920s went on, the violence became increasingly intense and savage as the object was to damage the enemy and improve one's bargaining power within the \\"alignment politics\\". Control of railroads was of great importance to the warlords. As the infrastructure in China was very poor, control of the railway lines and rolling stock were crucial in maintaining the sphere of influence. Railroads were the fastest and cheapest way of moving large number of troops, and most battles during this era were fought within a short distance of railways. In 1925, it was estimated that 70% of the locomotives on the railway lines connecting Wuhan and Beijing, and 50% of the locomotives on the lines connecting Beijing and Mukden were being used for mobilizing troops and supplies. Armored trains, full of machine guns and artillery, offered fire support for troops going into battle. The constant fighting around the railroads caused much economic harm. In 1925 at least 50% of the locomotives being used on the line connecting Nanjing and Shanghai had been destroyed, with the soldiers of one warlord using 300 freight cars as sleeping quarters, all inconveniently parked directly on the rail line. To hinder pursuit, defeated troops tore up the railroads as they retreated, causing in 1924 alone damage worth 100 million silver Mexican dollars (the Mexican silver dollar was the main currency used in China at the time). Between 1925 and 1927 fighting in eastern and southern China caused non- military railroad traffic to decline by 25%, raising the prices of goods and causing inventory to build up at warehouses.  Warlord profiles  Few of the warlords had any sort of ideology. Yan Xishan, the \\"Model Governor\\" of Shanxi, professed a syncretic creed that merged elements of democracy, militarism, individualism, capitalism, socialism, communism, imperialism, universalism, anarchism, and Confucian paternalism into one. A friend described Yan as \\"a dark-skinned, mustached man of medium height who rarely laughed and maintained an attitude of great reserve; Yan never showed his inner feelings.\\" He kept Shanxi on a different railroad gauge from the rest of China to make it difficult to invade his province, though that tactic also hindered the export of coal and iron; the main source of Shanxi's wealth. Feng Yuxiang, the \\"Christian General\\", promoted Methodism together with a vague sort of left- leaning Chinese nationalism, which led the Soviets to support him for a time. He banned alcohol, lived simply and wore the common uniform of an infantryman to show his concern for his men. Wu Peifu, the \\"Philosopher General\\", was a mandarin who passed the Imperial Civil Service exam, billing himself as the protector of Confucian values, usually appearing in photographs with the scholar's brush in his hand (the scholar's brush is a symbol of Confucian culture). Doubters noted, however, that the quality of Wu's calligraphy markedly declined when his secretary died. Wu liked to appear in photos taken in his office with a portrait of his hero George Washington in the background to reflect the supposed democratic militarism he was attempting to bring to China. Wu was famous for his capacity to absorb vast quantities of alcohol and still keep drinking. When he sent Feng a bottle of brandy, Feng replied by sending him a bottle of water, a message that Wu failed to take in. An intense Chinese nationalist, Wu Peifu refused to enter the foreign concessions in China, a stance that was to cost him his life when he refused to go to the International Settlement or the French Concession in Shanghai for medical treatment. Zhang Zongchang, one of the most infamous Chinese warlords More typical was Marshal Zhang Zuolin, a graduate of the \\"University of the Green Forest\\" (i.e., a bandit), an illiterate who had a forceful, ambitious personality that allowed him to rise up from the leader of a bandit gang, be hired by the Japanese to attack the Russians during the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05 and become the warlord of Manchuria by 1916. He worked openly for the Japanese in ruling Manchuria. Zhang controlled only 3% of China's population but 90% of its heavy industry. The wealth of Manchuria, the support of the Japanese and Zhang's hard-hitting, swift-moving cavalry made him the most powerful of the warlords. His Japanese patrons insisted that he ensure a stable economic climate to facilitate Japanese investment, making him one of the few warlords who sought to pursue economic growth instead of just plundering. Zhang Zongchang, known as the \\"Dogmeat General\\" because of his love for the gambling game of that name, was described as having \\"the physique of an elephant, the brain of a pig and the temperament of a tiger\\". Writer Lin Yutang called Zhang \\"the most colorful, legendary, medieval, and unashamed ruler of modern China\\". Former Emperor Puyi remembered Zhang as \\"a universally detested monster\\" whose ugly, bloated face was \\"tinged with the livid hue induced by heavy opium smoking\\". A brutal man, Zhang was notorious for his hobby of smashing in the heads of prisoners with his sword, which he called \\"smashing melons\\". He loved to boast about the size of his penis, which become part of his legend. He was widely believed to be the most well endowed man in China, nicknamed \\"General Eighty-Six\\" as his penis when erect was said to measure up to a pile of 86 Mexican silver dollars. His harem consisted of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Russian and two French women. He gave them numbers, as he could not remember their names, and then usually forgot the numbers. Other notable information on some of the above mentioned major warlords: #Zhang Zuolin \\"Warlord of Manchuria\\" became Japan's ally against Russia during the Russo-Japanese war. He had also served as the military governor of Mukden since 1911. # Wu Peifu was originally trained as a Confucian scholar, but later received Japanese military training at the Paoting military academy. He was thought by many Chinese and British observers to be a stabilizing force in Central China. # Feng Yuxiang was a soldier since childhood and like Wu, was a graduate of Paoting. He was baptized by a Y.M.C.A leader in 1913; He was known as the \\"Christian General\\" as he encouraged his troops to pursue Christianity. He seized Beijing in 1924 and demonstrated how easily a major Chinese city could be overthrown. Bandits in northwestern China, around 1915 The great ideological flexibility of warlords and politicians during this era can be well exemplified in the activities of Bai Lang, an important bandit leader. Even though he initially fought in support of the Qing dynasty with ultraconservative monarchists as well as warlords, Bai Lang later formed an alliance with republicans, declared himself loyal to Dr. Sun Yat-sen and formed a \\"Citizen's Punitive Army\\" to rid China of all the warlords.  Warlord armies  Many of the common soldiers in warlord armies were also bandits who took up service for a campaign and then reverted to banditry when the campaign was over. One politician remarked that when the warlords went to war with each other, the bandits become soldiers and when the war ended, the soldiers became bandits. Warlord armies commonly raped or took many women into sexual slavery. The system of looting was institutionalized, as many warlords lacked the money to pay their troops. Some took to kidnapping, and might send a hostage's severed fingers along with the ransom demand as a way of encouraging prompt payment. dao swords sometime in the 1920s. Some warlord armies, especially those in southern China, were badly armed, paid and supplied, and often lacked even basic necessities, such as guns, ammunition, and food. Besides bandits, the rank-and-file of the warlord armies tended to be village conscripts. They might take service in one army, get captured, then join the army of their captors before being captured yet again. Warlords usually incorporated their prisoners into their armies; at least 200,000 men who were serving in the army of Gen. Wu were prisoners he had incorporated into his own army. A survey of one warlord garrison in 1924 revealed that 90% of the soldiers were illiterate. In 1926 U.S. Army officer Joseph Stilwell inspected a warlord unit and observed that 20% were less than tall, the average age was 14 and most walked barefoot. Stilwell wrote that this \\"scarecrow company\\" was worthless as a military unit. A British army visitor commented that, provided they had proper leadership, the men of northern China were \\"the finest Oriental raw material with a physique second to none, and an iron constitution\\". However, such units were the exception rather than the rule. = Finances = Zhang Zuolin with two of his sons, both wearing expensive miniature uniforms In 1916 there were about a half-million soldiers in China. By 1922 the numbers had tripled, then tripled again by 1924; more than the warlords could support. For example, Marshal Zhang, the ruler of industrialized Manchuria, took in $23 million in tax revenues in 1925 while spending some $51 million. Warlords in other provinces were even more hard- pressed. One way of raising funds were taxes called lijin that were often confiscatory and inflicted much economic harm. For example, in Sichuan province there were 27 different taxes on salt, and one shipload of paper that was sent down the Yangtze River to Shanghai was taxed 11 different times by various warlords to the sum total of 160% of its value. One warlord imposed a tax of 100% on railroad freight, including food, even though there was a famine in his province. Taxes owed to the central government in Beijing on stamp and salt were usually taken by regional authorities. Despite all of the wealth of Manchuria and the support of the Japanese army, Marshal Zhang had to raise land taxes by 12% between 1922 and 1928 to pay for his wars. The warlords demanded loans from the banks. The other major revenue source besides taxes, loans and looting was the selling of opium, with the warlords selling the rights to grow and sell opium within their provinces to consortia of gangsters. Despite his ostensible anti-opium stance, Gen. Feng Yuxiang, \\"the Christian General\\", took in some $20 million per annum from opium sales. Inflation was another means of paying for their soldiers. Some warlords simply ran the money printing presses, and some resorted to duplicating machines to issue new Chinese dollars. The warlord who ruled Hunan province printed 22 million Chinese dollars on a silver reserve worth only one million Chinese dollars in the course of a single year, while Zhang in Shandong province printed 55 million Chinese dollars on a silver reserve of 1.5 million Chinese dollars during the same year. The illiterate Marshal Zhang Zuolin, who engaged in reckless printing of Chinese dollars, did not understand it was him who was causing the inflation in Manchuria, and his remedy was simply to summon the leading merchants of Mukden, accuse them of greed because they were always raising their prices, had five of them selected at random publicly shot and told the rest to behave better. Renault FT of the Fengtian clique during Northern Expedition Despite their constant need for money, the warlords lived in luxury. Marshal Zhang owned the world's biggest pearl, while Gen. Wu owned the world's biggest diamond. Marshal Zhang, the \\"Old Marshal\\", lived in a lavish palace in Mukden with his five wives, old Confucian texts and a cellar full of fine French wines, and needed 70 cooks in his kitchen to make enough food for him, his wives and his guests. Gen. Zhang, the \\"Dogmeat General\\", ate his meals off a 40-piece Belgian dinner service, and an American journalist described dinner with him: \\"He gave a dinner for me where sinful quantities of costly foods were served in a starving country. There was French champagne and sound brandy\\". = Equipment = The warlords bought machine guns and artillery from abroad, but their uneducated and illiterate soldiers could not operate or service them. A British mercenary complained in 1923 that Wu Peifu had about 45 European artillery pieces that were inoperable because they had not been properly maintained. At the Battle of Urga, the army of Gen. Xu Shuzheng, which had seized Outer Mongolia, was attacked by a Russian-Mongol army under the command of Gen. Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. The Chinese might have stopped Ungern had they been capable of firing their machine guns properly, to adjust for the inevitable upward jerk caused by the firing; they did not, and this caused the bullets to overshoot their targets. The inability to use their machine guns properly proved costly: after taking Urga in February 1921, Ungern had his Cossacks and Mongol cavalry hunt down the remnants of Xu's troops as they attempted to flee south on the road back to China.Palmer, James The Bloody White Baron The Extraordinary Story of the Russian Nobleman Who Become the Last Khan of Mongolia, New York: Basic Books, 2009 pages 149, 158.  Other forces  Because their soldiers were not able to use or take proper care of modern weapons, the warlords often hired foreign mercenaries, who were effective but always open to other offers. Russian émigrés who fled to China after the victory of the Bolsheviks were widely employed. The Russian mercenaries, according to one reporter, went through the Chinese troops like a knife through butter. The most highly paid of the Russian units was led by Gen. Konstantin Nechaev, who fought for Zhang Zongchang, the \\"Dogmeat General\\" who ruled Shandong province. Nechaev and his men were much feared. In 1926 they drove three armored trains through the countryside, gunning down everyone they met and taking everything moveable. The rampage was stopped only when the peasants pulled up the train tracks, which led Nechaev to sack the nearest town. To defend themselves from the attacks of the warlord factions and armies, peasants organized themselves into militant secret societies and village associations which served as self- defense militias as well as vigilante groups. As the peasants usually had neither money for guns nor military training, these secret societies relied on martial arts, self-made weapons such as swords and spears, as well as the staunch belief in protective magic. The latter was especially important, as the conviction of invulnerability was \\"a powerful weapon for bolstering the resolve of people who possessed few alternative resources with which to defend their meager holdings\\". Magical rituals practiced by the peasants ranged from rather simple ones, such as swallowing charms, to much more elaborate practices. For example, elements of the Red Spear Society performed secret ceremonies to confer invulnerability from bullets to channel the power of Qi and went into battle naked with supposedly bulletproof red clay smeared over their bodies. The Mourning Clothes Society would perform three kowtows and weep loudly before each battle. There were also all-female self-defense groups, such as the Iron Gate Society or the Flower Basket Society. The former would dress entirely in white (the color of death in China) and waved fans that they believed would deflect gunfire, while the latter fought with a sword and a magical basket to catch their opponents' bullets. Disappointed with the Republic of China and despairing due to the warlords deprivations, many peasant secret societies adopted millenarian beliefs, and advocated the restoration of the monarchy, led by the old Ming dynasty. The past was widely romanticized, and many believed that a Ming emperor would bring a \\"reign of happiness and justice for all\\".  Factions  = Northern factions = *Anhui clique *Zhili clique *Fengtian clique *Shanxi clique *Guominjun *Ma clique *Xinjiang clique = Southern factions = *Kuomintang *Yunnan clique *Guizhou warlords *Old Guangxi clique *New Guangxi clique *Guangdong warlords *Sichuan clique *Hunan warlords  North  This military symbol was based on the Five Races Under One Union flag. The death of Yuan Shikai split the Beiyang Army into two main factions. The Zhili and Fengtian clique were in alliance with one another, while the Anhui clique formed their own faction. International recognition was based on the presence in Beijing, and every Beiyang clique tried to assert their dominance over the capital to claim legitimacy. = Duan Qirui and Anhui dominance (1916–20) = While Li Yuanhong replaced Yuan Shikai as the President after his death, the political power was in the hands of Premier Duan Qirui. The government worked closely with the Zhili clique, led by Vice President Feng Guozhang, to maintain stability in the capital. Continuing military influence over the Beiyang government led to provinces around the country refusing to declare their allegiance. The debate between the President and the Premier on whether or not China should participate in the First World War was followed by political unrest in Beijing. Both Li and Duan asked Beiyang general Zhang Xun, stationed in Anhui, to militarily intervene in Beijing. As Zhang marched into Beijing on 1 July, he quickly dissolved the parliament and proclaimed a Manchu Restoration. The new government quickly fell to Duan after he returned to Beijing with reinforcements from Tianjin. As another government formed in Beijing, Duan's fundamental disagreements over national issues with the new President Feng Guozhang led to Duan's resignation in 1918. The Zhili clique forged an alliance with the Fengtian clique, led by Zhang Zuolin, and defeated Duan in the critical Zhili–Anhui War in July 1920. = Cao Kun and Zhili dominance (1920–24) = After the death of Feng Guozhang in 1919, the Zhili clique was led by Cao Kun. The alliance with the Fengtian was only one of convenience and war broke out in 1922 (the First Zhili–Fengtian War), with Zhili driving Fengtian forces back to Manchuria. Next, they wanted to bolster their legitimacy and reunify the country by returning Li Yuanhong to the presidency and restoring the National Assembly. They proposed that Xu Shichang and Sun Yat-sen resign their rival presidencies simultaneously in favor of Li. When Sun issued strict stipulations that the Zhili couldn't stomach, they caused the defection of KMT Gen. Chen Jiongming by recognizing him as governor of Guangdong. With Sun driven out of Guangzhou, the Zhili clique superficially restored the constitutional government that existed prior to Zhang Xun's coup. Cao bought the presidency in 1923 despite opposition by the KMT, Fengtian, Anhui remnants, some of his lieutenants and the public. In the autumn of 1924 the Zhili appeared to be on the verge of complete victory in the Second Zhili–Fengtian War until Feng Yuxiang betrayed the clique, seized Beijing and imprisoned Cao. Zhili forces were routed from the north but kept the center. =Duan Qirui return as chief executive (1924-1926)= Feng Yuxiang's defection resulted in the defeat of Wu Peifu and the Zhili clique and forced them to withdraw to the south. The victorious Zhang Zuolin unpredictably named Duan Qirui as the new Chief Executive of the nation on 24 November 1924. Duan's new government was grudgingly accepted by the Zhili clique because, without an army of his own, Duan was now considered a neutral choice. In addition, instead of \\"President\\" Duan was now called the \\"Chief Executive,\\" implying that the position was temporary and therefore politically weak. Duan called on Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang in the south to restart negotiations towards reunification. Sun demanded that the \\"unequal treaties\\" with foreign powers be repudiated and that a new national assembly be assembled. Bowing to public pressure, Duan promised a new national assembly in three months; however he could not unilaterally discard the \\"unequal treaties,\\" since the foreign powers had made official recognition of Duan's regime contingent upon respecting these very treaties. Sun died on 12 March 1925 and the negotiations fell apart. With his clique's military power in a shambles, Duan's government was hopelessly dependent on Feng Yuxiang and Zhang Zuolin. Knowing that those two did not get along, he secretly tried to play one side against the other. On 18 March 1926, a protest march was held against continued foreign infringement on Chinese sovereignty and a recent incident in Tianjin involving a Japanese warship. Duan dispatched military police to disperse the protesters, and in the resulting melee 47 protesters were killed and over 200 injured, including Li Dazhao, co-founder of the Communist Party. The event came to be known as the 18 March Massacre. The next month Feng Yuxiang again revolted, this time against the Fengtian clique, and deposed Duan, who was forced to flee to Zhang for protection. Zhang, tired of his double-dealings, refused to restore him after re-capturing Beijing. Most of the Anhui clique had already sided with Zhang. Duan Qirui exiled himself to Tianjin and later moved to Shanghai where he died on 2 November 1936. = Zhang Zuolin and Fengtian (1924–28) = During the Second Zhili–Fengtian War, Feng Yuxiang changed his support from Zhili to Fengtian and forced the Beijing Coup which resulted in Cao Kun being imprisoned. Feng soon broke off from the Zhili clique again and formed Guominjun and allied himself with Duan Qirui. In 1926, Wu Peifu from the Zhili clique launched the Anti-Fengtian War. Zhang Zuolin took advantage of the situation, and entered Shanhai Pass from the Northeast and captured Beijing. The Fengtian clique remained in control of the capital until the Northern Expedition led by Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army forced Zhang out of power in June 1928.  South  The party emblem of the Kuomintang The southern provinces of China were notably against the Beiyang government in the north, having resisted the restoration of monarchy by Yuan Shikai and the subsequent government in Peking after his death. Sun Yat-sen along with other southern leaders had formed a government in Guangzhou to resist the rule of the Beiyang warlords, and the Guangzhou government came to be known as part of the Constitutional Protection War. = Sun Yat-sen and \\"Constitutional protection\\" military junta in Guangzhou (1917–22) = In September Sun was named generalissimo of the military government with the purpose of protecting the provisional constitution of 1912. The southern warlords assisted his regime solely to legitimize their fiefdoms and challenge Beijing. In a bid for international recognition, they also declared war against the Central Powers but failed to garner any recognition. In July 1918 southern militarists thought Sun was given too much power and forced him to join a governing committee. Continual interference forced Sun into self- imposed exile. While away, he recreated the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang. With the help of KMT Gen. Chen Jiongming, committee members Gen. Cen Chunxuan, Adm. Lin Baoyi and Gen. Lu Rongting were expelled in the 1920 Guangdong–Guangxi War. In May 1921 Sun was elected \\"extraordinary president\\" by a rump parliament despite protests by Chen and Tang Shaoyi, who complained of its unconstitutionality. Tang left while Chen plotted with the Zhili clique to overthrow Sun in June 1922 in return for recognition of his governorship over Guangdong. = Reorganization of military junta in Guangzhou (1923–25) = After Chen was driven out of Guangzhou, Sun returned again to assume leadership in March 1923. The party was reorganized along Leninist democratic centralism, and the alliance with the Communist Party of China came to be known as First United Front. The Guangzhou government focused on training new officers through the newly created Whampoa Military Academy. In 1924, the Zhilii clique fell out of power, and Sun travelled to Beiping to negotiate terms of reunification with leaders from Guominjun, Fengtian and Anhui clique. He was unable to secure the terms as he died in March 1925 from illness. Power struggles within the KMT ensued after the death of Sun. The Yunnan–Guangxi War broke out as Tang Jiyao tried to claim party leadership. In the north, there were struggles led by Guominjun against Fengtian-Zhili alliance from November 1925 to April 1926. The defeat of Guominjun ended their reign in Beiping.  Reunification  Map of the campaigns of the Northern expedition of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek emerged as the protégé of Sun Yat-sen following the Zhongshan Warship Incident. In the summer of 1926, Chiang and the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) began the Northern Expedition with the hopes to reunify China. Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang of the Zhili clique were subsequently defeated in central and eastern China. In response to the situation, the Guominjun and Yan Xishan of Shanxi formed an alliance with Chiang to attack the Fengtian clique together. In 1927, Chiang initiated a violent purge of Communists in the Kuomintang, which marked the end of the First United Front. Though Chiang had consolidated the power of the KMT in Nanking, it was still necessary to capture Beiping (Beijing) to claim the legitimacy needed for international recognition. Yan Xishan moved in and captured Beiping on behalf of his new allegiance after the death of Zhang Zuolin in 1928. His successor, Zhang Xueliang, accepted the authority of the KMT leadership, and the Northern Expedition officially concluded. In course of the Central Plains War, several warlords attempted to overthrow Chiang Kai- shek's newly formed Nationalist government. Despite the defeat of the anti- Kuomintang forces, warlords continued to remain in power in much of China until the 1940s. The politics of the Nanjing Decade of Kuomintang leadership over China were deeply shaped by the compromises with warlords that had allowed the victory of the Northern expedition. Most provincial leaders were military commanders who joined the party only during the expedition itself, when the warlords and their administrators were absorbed wholesale by Chiang. Although dictatorial, Chiang did not have absolute power as party rivals and local warlords posed a constant challenge. Despite the reunification, there were still ongoing conflicts across the country. Remaining regional warlords across China chose to cooperate with the Nationalist government, but disagreements with the Nationalist government and regional warlords soon broke out into the Central Plains War in 1930. Northwest China erupted into a series of wars in Xinjiang from 1931 to 1937. Following the Xi'an Incident in 1936, efforts began to shift toward preparation of war against the Japanese Empire. The warlords continued posing problems for the National Government up until the communist victory in 1949, when many turned on the KMT and defected to the CCP, such as Yunnanese warlord Lu Han, whose troops had earlier been responsible for receiving the surrender of the Japanese in Hanoi and had engaged in widespread looting. Although Chiang was generally not considered personally corrupt, his power was dependent on balancing between the various warlords. Although he understood and expressed hatred at the fact that KMT corruption was driving the public to the communists, he continued dealing with warlords, tolerating incompetence and corruption while undermining subordinates who became too strong so as to preserve unity. After the Japanese surrender, warlords turned against the KMT.

Dating to the early part of the Anglo-Saxon Era of English history, it contains a variety of different forms of burial, with inhumation and cremation burials being found in roughly equal proportions. The site is also known for the inclusion of a high status ship burial. A number of these burials were included within burial mounds. The first recorded excavation of the site was conducted by antiquarians in 1827, with a later, more thorough investigation taking place in 1862 under the control of landowner Septimus Davidson. Artefacts from the earliest excavations soon disappeared, although important finds uncovered from the 1862 excavation included a glass claw beaker and the Snape Ring, now housed in The British Museum, London. During the 20th century, the heathland that the cemetery was on was given over to farmland, with a road and house being constructed atop the site. Today, the burial mounds themselves are not accessible to the public, although the artefacts uncovered by the excavation are on display at the Aldeburgh Moot Hall Museum in the nearby coastal town of Aldeburgh. Location The A1094 road at the point where it bisects through the Anglo-Saxon cemetery. On the right hand side is a series of pine trees shielding St. Margaret's House from passing traffic. The Snape Anglo-Saxon cemetery is located in the north-east corner of the modern parish of Snape, approximately 550 metres from the parish boundary with Friston.Filmer-Sankey 1992. p. 39.Filmer-Sankey 2001. p. 1. Although several modern houses stand on or near to the cemetery site, the main settlement at Snape village is located 1.5 kilometres away, with the village of Friston slightly nearer, at 1.25 kilometres away. The site is situated 2.5 kilometres north of the River Alde and 7 kilometres west of the coastal town of Aldeburgh and the North Sea. The cemetery is 17 kilometres north-east of the more famous Anglo-Saxon ship burial at Sutton Hoo. Prior to the 20th century, the site was a part of a large area of acid Sandlings Heathland which stretched from Snape all the way to Aldeburgh and which was used primarily for sheep grazing. By the 19th century at the latest, a road was built that bisected the cemetery, now designated the A1094. However, in the 1950s much of the heath was developed for agricultural use growing rape, linseed, potatoes and rye. The largely stone-free glacial sand of the heath is highly free- draining, and so extensive irrigation is required in the growing season. Alongside the farmland and the A1094, parts of the cemetery were also converted into a house, named St. Margaret's, along with an accompanying garden. The acidic soils in the area would have prevented the growth of most species of native British trees, and therefore it is probably that prior to the plantation of predominantly pine woodland in the vicinity of the cemetery during the 20th century, both the River Alde and the sea would have been visible from the mounds, as would the town of Iken. Background A map showing the general locations of the Anglo-Saxon peoples around the year 600, based upon Bede's account. The Anglo-Saxon period saw widespread changes in the society, language and culture of much of eastern Britain. Surviving sources of evidence for England in the 5th and 6th centuries remain \\"few and unsatisfactory in the extreme\\", consisting of limited archaeological evidence (primarily burials) alongside three primary textual sources, only one of which, the monk Gildas' De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, is contemporary.Blair 2000. p. 1. According to the monk Bede, writing in his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum in the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon age began when three tribal groups from Northern Germany and Southern Denmark - the Saxons, Angles and Jutes - began to migrate into Britain, where they were initially employed as mercenaries by the indigenous Romano-British population following the collapse of Roman Imperial rule. Archaeological evidence corroborates this, but also indicates the likely presence of a fourth continental tribal group settling in Britain during the 5th and 6th centuries, the Frisians.Blair 2000. p. 3. It is likely that the new settlers did not adhere strictly to their old tribal and ethnic ties, with new syncretic blends developing and new identities forged as they mixed with one another and with the indigenous British population. There is evidence that these colonists maintained ties with the Germanic-language cultures of Scandinavia, Germany and Northern France; they certainly traded with these societies for luxury goods, and told epic stories such as Beowulf which were set in their ancestral lands.Blair 2000. p. 4. The Snape cemetery lies within land that comprised a part of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of East Anglia, which according to Bede had been settled by the Angle tribe. =Ship burials in North-Western Europe= Cemetery features The Snape Anglo-Saxon cemetery has an east-west dimension of approximately 200 metres and a north-south dimension of approximately 70 metres.Filmer-Sankey 1992. p. 45. The ratio of the cremation to inhumation burials was approximately 1:1. Unlike at the Anglo-Saxon cemetery of Spong Hill in Norfolk, at Snape, these cremations and inhumations were not spatially divided, with both rites being completely intermixed and largely contemporary with one another.Filmer-Sankey 1992. p. 46. At least nine - and possibly ten - tumuli, or burial mounds, were erected at the site. =The Ship Burial= Model of the ship burial at Aldeburgh Moot Hall Museum. The Snape cemetery is best known for the boat burial that was uncovered there in 1862 by Septimus Davidson's excavation. Our knowledge of its shape and style comes from the accounts produced by Davidson and his excavators, alongside Davidson's plan, the most reliable version of which is a watercolour painting held in the library of the Society of Antiquaries; this was produced \\"either during or very shortly after the excavation\\", and was used as the basis for the subsequent engravings of the ship, for which extra, often erroneous details were added. Alongside these early accounts and plans, we also have access to the surviving rivets and other ironwork now housed in Aldeburgh Moot Hall Museum.Filmer-Sankey 1992. p. 41. Rivets from the Snape ship on exhibit at Aldeburgh Moot Hall Museum. The ship was at least 14 metres long and contained a beam 3 metres in width. Clinker built with riveted construction, the rivets were spaced at intervals of approximately 140 millimetres and according to the watercolour painting, there were nine strakes a side. The rivets are of usual Anglo-Saxon style, being composed of iron and having domed heads and diamond roves. Excavators also uncovered fragments of a metal strip, at least 300 millimetres in length, which was vertically riveted to the outside of the hull. Filmer-Sankey noted that this could be interpreted as a chain plate that held the shrouds of a mast. The boat was positioned on an east to west axis. It apparently once contained within it a high status burial, but the grave had already been robbed by the 1863 excavation, meaning that many of the grave goods had probably already been removed. Nevertheless, several grave goods had remained, and were discovered by Davidson and his excavators; these included two iron spearheads, suggesting that the burial might have been male, the gold Snape Ring and a glass claw beaker. Another find from the burial was initially described as a \\"mass of human hair... wrapped in a cloth of some kind\\", although later archaeologists reinterpreted this as a form of shaggy cloak akin to those found at Sutton Hoo and Broomfield.Filmer-Sankey 1992. p. 42. Also uncovered were some fragments initially identified as jasper and a single fragment of blue glass. The ship burial was relatively dated using these artefacts, meaning that the burial of the ship was given a \\"very tentative\\" terminus post quem of circa 550 CE.Filmer-Sankey 1992. p. 52. =Cremations= Funerary urn found at the burial. =Inhumations= Significant artefacts =Snape Ring= The best known artefact from the Anglo-Saxon burial is the Snape ring, which consists of a Roman onyx gemstone engraved with the figure of Bonus Eventus which has been set in a large hoop. Filmer-Sankey disputed Rupert Bruce-Mitford's analysis, arguing instead that the Snape Ring had been created in continental Europe, probably by Frankish craftsmen in the early-mid 6th century. Supporting this idea, he noted that it had close parallels in both form and decoration to Frankish jewelry of this date and that Germanic settings of Roman intaglios are common on the continent but otherwise unknown from Anglo- Saxon England. =Glass claw-beaker= Claw beaker found at the burial. Another of the significant finds from the burial was a glass claw-beaker. Filmer-Sankey noted that it probably dated to the mid-sixth century. Antiquarian and archaeological investigation The first recorded excavation at the site took place in 1827, when seven or eight gentlemen, reported to be Londoners, opened up several of the barrows at the site, discovering \\"quantities of gold rings, brooches, chains etc.\\" After their activities at Snape, they proceeded to dig up a tumulus on the other side of the River Alde, at Blaxhall Common. Little is known of their findings, but a letter recording the event was sent to The Field magazine in March 1863 by a man from Snape who was only a boy at the time of the original excavation. Nothing more is known of either the excavators or the artefacts that they unearthed.Filmer-Sankey 1992. p. 40.Filmer-Sankey 2001. p. 5. It is believed that the mounds were excavated for a second time in the mid-19th century by antiquarians working for the Ordnance Survey; no records of this investigation have been found. =Davidson excavation: 1862-1863= A third, more systematic and thorough excavation of the cemetery was then undertaken in 1862 by Septimus Davidson, the landowner of the area of the heath that fell to the north of the bisecting road. A city solicitor and former legal adviser to the government of the Ottoman Empire, he had no training in excavation, but was curious as to the historic mounds that lay on his land. He was assisted in this endeavor by three others: local surgeon Dr Nicholas Hele, and two other men known only as Francis Francis and 'Mr C'. Although none of them had any training in excavation, they did so in a meticulous manner, starting with a pit in the centre of each mound and then digging outwards, all the time recording the position of artefacts, such as the ship rivets, in situ. There were nevertheless problems, such as when a spade shattered the rim of a buried urn. With the exception of Mr C, the excavators each wrote and published their own accounts of the excavation, which displayed a great deal of consistency with one another. Davidson's account was presented at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries in January 1863, while Francis published two articles in The Field in January and March 1863, followed by a paper for the Archaeological Journal. Hele then devoted a chapter to the excavation in his 1870 book Notes and Jottings about Aldeburgh. Commenting on the site, Davidson noted that it contained either nine or ten mounds, five of which were described as \\"large\\". He excavated only three of the large mounds which were owned by him and which had come to be damaged by passing traffic. In two of these, he found no evidence of a grave, but in the third uncovered the remains of a ship burial, which he recorded in a level of detail unknown at the time. The current knowledge of this burial relies largely on Davidson's account from the time.Filmer-Sankey 1992. pp. 40-41. The discovery of the ship burial was the first of its kind to have been discovered and recognised in England, although two years previously excavators at Sutton Hoo had dug through a boat burial without realising what it was. Although novel in Britain, such ship burials had already been uncovered and reported on by archaeologists working in Scandinavia.Filmer-Sankey 2001. p. 6. Enthused by the success of the dig, he decided to return to excavate at the cemetery the following year, putting in a trench twelve yards long which unearthed over forty vases and a few other finds.Filmer-Sankey 2001. p. 7. =Subsequent finds: 1920-1985= In the 1920s, the cemetery site saw the construction of a house known as St. Margaret's, immediately north of the three mounds that Davidson had excavated. The tumuli themselves became a part of the house's garden, which was ringed with some newly planted pines. It has been claimed that various urns were discovered both in the construction of the house and when digging holes for the plantation of the trees, although such claims have never been corroborated and the finds never located.Filmer-Sankey 2001. p. 8. During the Second World War, the heathland began to be ploughed for agricultural usage, although no finds were ever reported. In 1951, the mounds on the southern side of the road, which Davidson had not excavated, were also ploughed over, although again no finds were recorded. The importance of Snape cemetery within Anglo- Saxon archaeology had been eclipsed by the 1939 excavation of the ship burial under Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo under the directorship of Basil Brown (1888-1977).Filmer-Sankey 2001. p. 11. In an academic paper published in the pages of the Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology in 1952, the archaeologist Rupert Bruce-Mitford (1914-1994) began Snape's rehabilitation by providing a full summary of Dickinson's excavation, later being described by archaeologist William Filmer-Sankey as \\"a brilliant synthesis of what was then known\\".Bruce-Mitford 1952. In 1970 a dowser named Major-General Scott-Elliott was exploring the cemetery and uncovered a single urn about 40 metres west of the garden.Filmer-Sankey 1992. p. 43.Filmer-Sankey 2001. p. 9. In 1972, a sewer trench was being dug along the northern side of the road, and after a local resident alerted Ipswich Museum it was agreed that archaeologists would observe the construction. They subsequently recovered nine cremations, seven being urned, one being in a thin bronze bowl and the other being loose. The landscape having been dramatically altered since Dickinson's excavations, in 1982 Stephen Dockrill of the School of Archaeological Science at Bradford University undertook two trial magnetometry and resistivity trial surveys of the site; the latter showed a possible base and ring-ditch surrounding a ploughed-out tumulus. Over the following three years, the resistivity survey was extended to cover 13,000m² of the area, first under the leadership of Dockrill and then of Dr Roger Walker of Geoscan Research. The results however were of little use, showing no Anglo-Saxon features against the variable geological background. =Filmer-Sankey excavation: 1985-1992= Renewed archaeological interest in the Snape site came about following the 1983 commencement of new excavations at Sutton Hoo under the directorship of Martin Carver of the University of York. Carver had emphasised that Sutton Hoo had to be understood in the wider East Anglian context, a part of which was Snape. Exhibit on the burial at Albdeburgh Moot Hall Museum. Filmer-Sankey's investigation was twofold. First, he undertook a thorough investigation into the documents pertaining to previous excavations at the site, through which his team ascertained that although the ship burial was the most notable feature of the site, the cemetery primarily contained cremation burials, and was therefore best compared with the Norfolk cemetery of Spong Hill. This accomplished, the secondary task of developing a sampling strategy had to be devised. The use of fieldwalking and geophysical survey had already proved unsuccessful, and so it was decided that excavation would be used as the primary method of investigation. In 1985, fourteen 3×3 trenches were opened, but only two cremation urns, both damaged by ploughing, were uncovered. One of these trenches was subsequently enlarged to 6×6 metres, revealing both two further funerary urns and an inhumation burial. This discovery meant that the excavators had to rethink their sampling strategy and wider approach to the site. From 1986 through to 1988, the excavation team dug up a total of an area that was 17 × 20 metres in the field believed to be adjacent to the original ship burial, producing 17 cremation and 21 inhumation burials, one of which was the smaller boat burial. From 1989 through to 1990, the plan was to use the information gathered over the previous two years to devise a strategy that would locate the limits of the cemetery. This led to the excavation of eighteen trenches, each 2 metres wide and orientated north-to-south, on the assumed edges of the cemetery. In 1992, Filmer-Sankey published an overview of the excavations that had taken place up to that date as an academic paper in Martin Carver's edited anthology, The Age of Sutton Hoo: The Seventh Century in North-Western Europe.Filmer-Sankey 1992. Filmer-Sankey's final excavation report eventually appeared in 2001 as the 95th volume in the East Anglian Archaeology Report series published by Suffolk County Council.Filmer-Sankey 2001.

The region, originally settled by an English family in the early 18th century, was named Hunting Quarters by the local Coree Indians, living on the plentiful game, fish and oysters.  History  Some of King Charles II \\"Lords Proprietors\\", Sir George Carteret being one of many, had advertised in England offering of land to the provider of passage for each colonist brought to North Carolina. Thus, on October 28, 1702, Captain John Nelson, owner and operator of his own ship filed what was called an \\"Entry to Land\\" which gave him title to six hundred acres of land in what is now Sea Level, Carteret County, North Carolina. In order to keep his land he was required to occupy and use the land or it would be forfeited, thus \\"Hunting Quarters Plantions\\" was born. Captain John and his wife Ann Bell, daughter of Joseph Bell and Margaret, acquired large tracts of land on the north and south side of the Neuse River where they raised their children. They planted a number of orchards on the plantations and well as the usual crops. They remained active with the sea as well. The main plantation was on the north side of the Neuse River and a smaller plantation was on the south side near the present day site of Garbacon Creek. He owned property in Craven, Carteret (Hunting Quarters, Sea Level, Merrimon, Adams Creek and on Core Banks) and Hyde Counties. When their son Thomas died in 1750 leaving his wife and two sons, Thomas Jr. and John, Captain John transferred to the boys, appointing his son James as overseer and instructing him that the widow Elizabeth was to receive one-third of the profits of the orchards and the grounds for her lifetime. When young Thomas Jr. became of age in 1759, he gave his younger brother John of this area as well as in Hunting Quarters for \\"his better maintenance and livelyhood\\". It appears that John married and died in his forties. Thomas Jr. died after 1800 and had apparently built a very good shipping business with his ship the \\"Hunter\\", as well as having a very prosperous plantation. After Ann died, Captain John married Mary Lewis Taylor. He provided for Mary by giving her a slave and rights to one- half of his Hunting Quarters property for her lifetime. They had no children but Mary had three from an earlier marriage. John died in 1760 and Mary in 1799.

The film spoofs Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather series and various other mafia films, notably Martin Scorsese's Casino (1995). It also parodies films in other genres, ranging from Forrest Gump to Il Postino and The English Patient. Plot Like the 1974 film The Godfather Part II, the narrative of Mafia! consists of a series of flashbacks interwoven with the main plot. Tony is the son of a prominent Mafia don, Vincenzo Armani Windbreaker Cortino. As the film opens, Tony introduces the main thread when he exits a Vegas casino and walks to his car, accompanied by a voiceover explaining his philosophy of life. When he starts the car, it explodes. The story then regresses more than half a century to describe the boyhood of Tony's father, Vincenzo, who was born in Italy, the clumsy son of a Sicilian postman. One day, while making a delivery for his father, Vincenzo trips and the parcel bursts open, revealing a strange white powder. The parcel's recipient, concluding that the delivery boy has seen too much, tracks Vincenzo to a street fair, where he kills his father. The boy escapes to America, where he grows to young manhood, marries, and struggles with poverty before finally finding his destiny as a mafia boss. The film then visits the recent past; Tony has just returned from the Korean War and is bringing his idealistic Protestant girlfriend, Diane, to meet his family and friends at his big brother Joey's wedding reception (a parody of Connie Corleone's wedding in the beginning of the 1972 film The Godfather). During the festivities, however, Vincenzo is shot 47 times in an attempted hit and nearly dies. Tony announces his intention to kill Gorgoni, a drug lord with whom Vincenzo had refused to do business before the attack. Diane leaves him, saying he's abandoned the peaceful ideals of his youth, and adding that she'll never be anything to his Sicilian family but \\"that Protestant chick who never killed anyone.\\" Tony avenges the attack, then goes into hiding in Las Vegas, where Cesar Marzoni offers him the opportunity to manage his casino, The Peppermill. Tony accepts and his casino is a great success until he meets a femme fatale, Pepper Gianini, hired by Marzoni as part of a deep-laid plan to distract him from his duties and to drive a wedge between him and Joey. Vincenzo recovers from his 47 gunshot wounds and visits Las Vegas, where he officially names Tony his successor. Joey, furious at being passed over, is told \\"You get Wisconsin.\\" The Don then returns home, where he falls victim to his 5-year-old grandson, Chucky, who assassinates him by spraying him with malathion (parody of Vito Corleone's heart attack in The Godfather). The film returns to the present after Tony catches Joey and Pepper cavorting in a hotel room together and walks out in disgust - only to have his car explode. Tony is horribly but temporarily disfigured, and attends his father's funeral in a wheelchair, where he spots the killers when he sees little Chucky taking a payoff. However, he decides to postpone vengeance until he can win back Diane's love and put his life in order. Diane has by this time become President of the United States, and is on the brink of declaring total world disarmament when Tony goes looking for her. He persuades her to put world peace on the back burner until after their wedding. During the ceremony, with the help of Vincenzo's mother (Dukakis), several henchmen, and an Eskimo, he settles the family's accounts in an orgy of slaughter (filmed similarly to the end of The Godfather), even arranging the harpooning of Barney the Dinosaur as a bonus.

It was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland). It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 December 2013. Toowoomaba South is one of the oldest primary schools in Queensland. It is the oldest State School in Toowoomba (although nearby Drayton State School is older). It was first opened in 1865, as school number 112. Initially the school was co-educational. It was closed in 2013.  History  Toowoomba South State School was established as Toowoomba National School in 1865 on a large site in what was then the civic centre of Toowoomba. Over time it has acquired a number of buildings and landscape elements, including a playshed (1884), an open-air annexe (1913), a main, three-storey brick building (1941), a timber building called the Oslo Lunch Room (1945), a concrete, brick and timber classroom wing called the Wadley Wing (1959), and mature trees. It has been an important place of education since its establishment and a social and cultural focus for students, parents, teachers and members of the Toowoomba community. European settlement of the Toowoomba area, traditional country of the Giabal and Jarowair people, commenced in 1840 when squatters first occupied pastoral runs on the Darling Downs. Near the boundaries of Westbrook, Gowrie and Eton Vale runs and at the junction of two routes to Gorman's and Hodgson's gaps through the Main Range, the small settlement of Drayton (originally known as \\"The Springs\\") evolved from 1842 as a stopping place servicing pastoralists and travellers. From the late 1840s, the Drayton Swamp Agricultural Area (\\"The Swamp\\" now Toowoomba), six kilometres to the north-east, began to be considered a more desirable location for settlement. Better land for market gardening, improved water supply, the support of squatters and land speculators, and, from 1855, a better route to Brisbane (the Toll Bar Road), were all advantages over Drayton. In September 1853 a government survey reserved two blocks of land in Toowoomba for important civic functions. The blocks were bound by Ruthven, Lawrence, Hume and James streets, bisected by Neil Street. The reserves were for the Toowoomba Benevolent Asylum (later hospital), Roman Catholic and Presbyterian churches and schools, Toowoomba Town Hall, a market reserve and a National School on the corner of Lawrence and Ruthven streets. The allocation of land for these purposes in this area occurred because James Street was developing as the main commercial street, the route used by people travelling to Ipswich or south and west. The site was reserved for a National School in Toowoomba is the present-day site at the rear of the existing campus now occupied by the Toowoomba South State School Hall, and the basketball and tennis courts (the corner of Lawrence and Ruthven Streets). The site of the current buildings was the hospital. The name \\"Toowoomba\\" had gradually taken over from \\"The Swamp\\" by 1857 and the settlement continued to expand. At the time of its incorporation into a municipality (the Borough of Toowoomba) in November 1860, Toowoomba was on the way to supplanting Drayton as the principal service centre for the upper Darling Downs. Prior to 1859, Toowoomba's population was around 1500. Five years later this figure had doubled. The rapid economic and social development of Toowoomba in the 1860s was influenced by local residents who strongly promoted the prospects of the town, and political representatives who successfully lobbied for government funding for civic improvements. By 1861 local residents were agitating for the establishment of a government school. Colonial governments played an important role in the provision of formal education. In 1848 (before the separation of Queensland in 1859) the New South Wales Government established National Schools. This was continued by the Queensland Government after the colony's creation in 1859. The Education Act 1860 established the Queensland Board of General Education and began to standardise curriculum, teacher training and facilities. The Education Act 1875 provided a number of key initiatives for primary education; it was to be free, compulsory and secular. The Department of Public Instruction was established to administer the Act. This move standardised the provision of education and, despite difficulties, colonial educators achieved a remarkable feat in bringing basic literacy to most Queensland children by 1900. The provision of schools was considered an essential step in the development of early Queensland communities. The formal education of Queensland children was seen as integral to the success of a town, the colony and the nation. Land and construction labour was often donated by the local people and schools frequently became a major focus within the community as a place symbolising progress, for social interaction, and as a source of pride. Also, the development and maintenance of schools frequently involved donations and work by teachers, parents, and pupils. Because of their significant connections with the local community, schools have occasionally incorporated other socially important elements such as war memorials and halls used for community purposes. They also typically retain a significant enduring connection with former pupils, their parents, and teachers. Social events involving a wide portion of the local community have often been held at schools, utilising the buildings and grounds - such as fetes, markets, public holiday celebrations, school break-up days, fundraisers, sporting events, reunions, and dances. As in other Australian colonies, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. This helped to ensure consistency and economy. The standard designs were continually refined by government architects in response to changing needs and educational philosophy. Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in their approach to climate control, lighting and ventilation. Until the 1960s school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, taking advantage of the material's abundance in the state and the high number of builders skilled in its use. This also allowed for easy and economical construction and enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Due to the standardisation of facilities, schools across the state were developed in distinctly similar ways and became complexes of typical components. These components included: the teaching building/s, the school yard, the horse paddock which was often later configured into a sports oval, the teacher's residence, and a variety of features such as sporting facilities or play equipment, shade structures, gardens and trees. While the school site had been reserved in 1853, it was continued lobbying a decade later that led to the opening of the Toowoomba's first state-run primary school. In August 1863, the Courier reported \\"great exertions\\" being made towards the establishment of a National School for Toowoomba. By the end of the year the \\"Local Patrons\\", the committee advocating for the school, were advised the Board of Education was intending to call immediately for tenders for the erection of a brick school at a cost of £300. On behalf of the town, the local patrons guaranteed the supply of £100 towards the school's construction. On 25 January 1864 the Chairman of the Board of Education, Arthur Macalister, laid the foundation stone for the school. Construction of the school, designed by architect Benjamin Backhouse and built by Mr Young, continued through 1864, a year when other important buildings for Toowoomba, including the Post Office and the hospital, were in progress or completed. The Toowoomba National School opened on 22 January 1865 on the school reserve, with James Hodgson appointed the first Head Teacher. As pupil attendance increased, the initial building soon became inadequate. Construction of a new building on the site to accommodate female and infant students was complete by October 1869. The school was remade into two separate departments, renamed Toowoomba South Boys' State School and Toowoomba South Girls' and Infants' State School. The Girls' and Infants' school began with 98 pupils enrolled with Mary Jane Roulston as the first Head Teacher. In 1869, the school was separated into the Toowoomba South Boys School (number 109) and the Toowoomba South Girls School (number 112). This led to there being two campuses the original on Ruthven Street being the Girls School, the other one block northeast on Neil Street the new Boys School campus (adjacent to the Market Reserve (now Groom Park)). The two schools were separated by Neil Street and St Patrick's Church (Catholic). In 1878, the girls school became known as the Toowoomba Middle Girls State School and the Infants School was opened as Toowoomba Middle Infants (number 399). During the 1870s Toowoomba consolidated its status as the main urban centre of the Darling Downs. The arrival of the Main Line railway in 1867 secured the town's development and subsequently made it the hub for the Southern and Western railways. The economy diversified to include numerous small-scale manufacturing outlets, while the majority of administrative, service and other government and education functions for the surrounding region were centred on the town. Toowoomba's progress was reflected in improvements to the physical environment. Important capital works were commenced or completed including the draining of the swamps, improved water supply, gasworks for lighting, extensive tree plantings and the initial development of Queen's Park. Earlier temporary structures were increasingly replaced with more permanent and impressive buildings. In 1877 the hospital adjacent to the school was vacated after a new hospital was built on the outskirts of the town. The school expanded to incorporate the hospital site and occupied the two newly-vacant hospital buildings; the boys occupied the former men's ward and the girls and infants occupied the former women's ward. A playshed was constructed to the rear of the former hospital buildings in January 1884. Playsheds were free-standing shelters that provided covered play space and were often used for unofficial teaching space when needed. They were timber-framed structures, generally open on all sides although were sometimes partially enclosed with timber boards or corrugated galvanised iron sheets. The hipped (or less frequently, gabled) roofs were clad with timber shingles or corrugated iron and they had an earth or decomposed granite floor. Fixed timber seating ran between the perimeter posts. Playsheds were a typical addition to state schools across Queensland between s and the 1950s. They were built to standard designs that ranged in size relative to student numbers. School sites were typically cleared of all vegetation and the provision of all-weather outdoor space was needed. After school buildings were high-set, allowing students to play in the understorey and playsheds were not frequently constructed. The playshed at Toowoomba was built to a standard design. The construction plans show it was with a hipped roof clad with corrugated iron sheets, generous eaves, and supported on 10 timber posts. It had timber perimeter seating and the floor was gravel (altered to asphalt in 1885). The playshed is the oldest structure on the school site. By the 1890s a well- developed area in the northern area near the railway station centred on Russell Street had emerged as the commercial centre of Toowoomba, while government activities centred on Margaret Street, in the vicinity of the court house. The James Street area was considered to be the fringe. Toowoomba's municipal council had built a new town hall in 1880 but by 1898 had decided to relocate the town hall to a more central location on Ruthven Street, with the new Toowoomba City Hall completed in 1900. The former town hall site became available for redevelopment and was purchased by the Queensland Government. In 1906 the girls and infants moved to a new school building on the nearby site of the former town hall. By this time there were 300 pupils enrolled at the school. The former women's hospital ward was condemned and demolished. Other school buildings were demolished or removed leaving the western side of the school site empty. This land was subdivided into many small allotments and sold. By 1938 it was decided the two Toowoomba South schools would swap sites. According to the schools' centenary booklet, increasing attendances and limited playground space for the boys were both factors in this decision. The move to the girls' and infants' site meant the boys could access the large playing field of Groom Park behind the school. In December 1939 the Executive Council authorised the demolition of the boys' school (the \\"obsolescent\\" former men's hospital ward), and the construction of a new brick building for the girls' and infants' school. Plans had been drawn for a substantial, three- storey brick building in December 1938 by Department of Public Works architect Gilbert Robert Beveridge. It was one of an important group of brick school buildings built during and after the Great Depression, initially as part of the government's unemployment relief program. Unemployment relief projects at schools, in the form of grounds improvement works, were undertaken by the previous Country and Progressive National Party government (1929-1932) led by Premier Arthur Moore. The relief work program expanded considerably in 1932 when newly elected Labor Premier William Forgan-Smith instituted a capital works program focussed on building modern infrastructure to provide relief work for unemployed Queenslanders. The \\"improvement\\" of schools was a primary aspect of the scheme. Large new buildings at Toowoomba East State School (1936) and Toowoomba North State School (1937) were constructed during this time. The relief work program ended in 1938, transitioning into a permanent, long-term, capital works program. In accordance with government policy, the Department of Public Works maintained the use of day labour for building projects. Until the 1960s, purpose-built brick government schools were far less common than those of timber. If brick was employed, it was usually only in prosperous urban or suburban areas with stable or rapidly-increasing populations. Earlier government brick school buildings were individually designed with variations in style, size, and form, similar to Queensland's private schools, technical colleges and Schools of Arts. They were given comparatively generous budgets, resulting in impressive edifices. Light and ventilation was still a primary concern for the architects but compared to contemporary timber education buildings, these buildings had a grander character and greater landmark attributes. The pattern of brick school buildings in prosperous or rising suburban areas continued during the 1930s relief work scheme, in greater numbers and as a more recognisable type. The Queensland Public Works Department and Department of Public Instruction were extremely enthusiastic about the brick school buildings designed in the 1930s. They were considered monuments to progress, embodying the most modern principles of the ideal education environment. The 1930s brick school buildings exhibited many common characteristics. Frequently, they were two storeys above an open understorey and built to accommodate up to 1000 students. They adopted a symmetrical plan form and exhibited neo-classical stylistic elements and a prominent central entry. They were able to be built in stages if necessary. The plan arrangement was similar to that of timber buildings being only one classroom deep, accessed by a long straight verandah. Ideally, the classrooms would face south with the verandah on the north but little concession was made for this in practice and almost all brick school buildings faced the primary boundary road, regardless of orientation. Classrooms were commonly divided by folding timber partitions and the undercroft was used as covered play space, storage, ablutions and other functions. The brick school building for Toowoomba South Girls' and Infants' State School was prominently sited, fronting James Street, and was typical of its type. It was a three-storey symmetrical building comprising an understorey at ground level that accommodated open play space and ablutions, and two upper levels that accommodated 11 classrooms, teachers' rooms, and generous hat and cloak rooms. All but one of the classrooms faced south. Construction of the brick building had begun by March 1940. It was nearing completion in early 1941 when alterations were made to accommodate infant classes; a partition was removed to combine a teacher's room and classroom on the second floor. This also involved rearrangement of the corridor windows and the blocking up of a western window. The building was one of the Department of Public Works' major construction projects of 1940. Other important buildings constructed at this time include the Innisfail Courthouse, Brisbane Dental Hospital and College and the Maryborough Courthouse. The volume of work for state schools in the year ending June 1940 was high, with 11 new schools completed and additions made to 30 schools, as well as the remodelling of others. The Girls' and Infants' School and Opportunity School pupils moved to the new school site on 17 March 1941, while work was still being completed. The building was officially opened 21 June 1941 by Minister for Public Instruction, Henry Bruce. It cost £16,500, accommodated 480 students and was constructed using day labour. Behind the new brick building was positioned an older building that had been relocated from the former girls' and infants' school site and was ready for occupation in 1941. This building was an Open-air annexe, the first of its type built in Queensland. It had been opened 29 November 1913 by Under-Secretary for Education, John Douglas Story. Open-air annexes were introduced as a standard design in 1913 by the Department of Public Instruction. This design was developed in response to contemporary medical thought related to the need for adequate ventilation and high levels of natural light for health, coupled with the need to build cheap, portable schools. Dr Eleanor Bourne had been appointed the first Medical Inspector of Schools in 1911 and under her instruction the relationship between classroom environment and child health was given prominence. Accordingly, school architecture evolved through iteration and experimentation to improve interior light and ventilation. The open-air annexe type achieved maximum ventilation and natural light; it contained only one large room and had only one wall, the western verandah wall. The other sides were open with only adjustable canvas blinds for enclosure. Ideally, they would be high-set, thereby increasing the ventilation and providing further shelter underneath. The design was praised by educationalists as conducive to the health of pupils. On its original site, the open-air annexe was used for infants' classes. It was a high-set, timber- framed building with a gable roof and comprised one large room . It had a west-facing verandah that was semi-enclosed at both ends to form hat rooms. As per the standard design, the classroom had only one wall (the western verandah wall) and the other sides were open and had adjustable canvas blinds. Open-air annexes proved to be inadequate and were discontinued in 1923, although many had been constructed across Queensland in 10 years. The open sides provided limited weather protection, better climate control was needed, and the canvas blinds deteriorated quickly. All open-air annexes in Queensland were modified to provide better enclosure. By 1929 the open-air annexe at Toowoomba was enclosed; the blinds were replaced with casement windows. A small, semi- detached extension with a hipped roof was added to the centre of the western verandah accommodating a teacher's room at the classroom level and a store room underneath. In 1930 the western verandah was enclosed with sliding sashes and the balustrade was replaced by cement sheet. After its enclosure, minimal alterations of the open-air annexe at Toowoomba were made over time. When the open-air annexe was relocated behind the new brick building, it was positioned so the verandah faced north. In 1952, improvements were made to the lighting and ventilation of the classroom by adding soffit vents and single hung sash windows into the verandah wall. After relocation, the open-air annexe was used for opportunity classes. Opportunity schools (initially called Backward Classes) had been established in 1923 by the Department of Public Instruction in seven Queensland schools, one of which was Toowoomba South Girls' and Infants' State School. The previous year, Minister for Education, John Huxham, said he knew of only one teacher in the state who was interested in and suitable for this form of special education; Head Teacher of Toowoomba South Girls' and Infants' State School, Mary Deacon. Opportunity classes were designed to accelerate students with learning difficulties and to teach disabled children vocational skills. The provision of special state education for struggling and disabled students was prompted by community agitation and was part of the wider social, medical and educational modernising reforms of the 1920s. State-funded special education began in Queensland in 1893 when government subsidy was provided to a benevolent training centre in Brisbane that taught blind and deaf children. However, it took until 1923 and the drive of District Inspector William Bevington before children with intellectual and emotional problems and other physical disabilities were included in state education programs. The establishment of special education was an important step in providing an inclusive state education system. On 25 January 1960 the Toowoomba Opportunity (later Special) School moved off-site into purpose- designed premises. The open-air annexe was then used by the school for various ancillary teaching space, including music and film classes, and a library. The Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the enormous demand for state education that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. This was a nationwide occurrence resulting from the unprecedented population growth, now commonly referred to as the \\"baby boomers\\". Queensland schools were overcrowded and to cope; many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended. After 1945, Toowoomba continued the steady growth that had largely characterised its first century of development. The city's estimated population in mid-1953 was 40,000, a rapid expansion from the 1947 census figure of 35,194. Primary and secondary industries expanded, tourist numbers grew, and construction projects provided a boom for the local building industry. In 1954 alone, over £2,000,000 worth of projects were undertaken including new dwellings, commercial buildings, and other expansion projects. The growth of Toowoomba was reflected at the Toowoomba South Girls' and Infants' State School by increased enrolments and building additions to the school. At the time of the transfer of Grade 8 students to high school at the end of 1963, there were around 700 pupils at the school. A building was constructed at Toowoomba South Girls' and Infants' State School in 1945 using money granted to the school by the Commonwealth Government. This money was granted to all schools in 1945 to commemorate the end of World War II and the amount was based on enrolment numbers. A meeting of mothers convened by head teacher, Aileen Wadley, had decided the funds would be used to establish the \\"Oslo Lunch Room\\", a tuckshop offering healthy lunches (based on the Norwegian nutritious lunch movement) that would be \\"a permanent benefit to the children of the school\\". The building was a standard, temporary building designed by the Department of Public Works. Temporary buildings were constructed at the Girls' and Infants' school between 1943 and 1951. This standard type was introduced as an expedient, temporary solution to the exceptional growth in student numbers during World War II and the immediate post-war period when skilled labour was scarce and materials were in short supply. They were small timber buildings, low-set on concrete piers and had skillion or gabled roofs clad with corrugated metal sheets. External walls were clad with vertical tongue and groove timber boards and the rear wall had casements with operable fanlights sheltered by a simple hood. Accessed from a verandah, the type comprised two interconnected classrooms , which was consistent with the department's ideal dimensions of the time. The design, materials and form were a departure from earlier types; they did not influence subsequent designs, and only a small number of temporary buildings were constructed. Drawings for the construction of the Oslo Lunch Room show that it was a timber-framed and -clad building with a skillion roof and accommodated two interconnected rooms. It was positioned to the west of the open-air annexe and to the south of the playshed. The building was oriented so the verandah faced north and the windows of the rooms faced south. The Oslo Lunch Room opened in 1946. In 1947 a three-storey extension was added to the rear of the 1941 brick building providing a further two classrooms (one on each of the first and second floors) and an understorey play space. The extension was designed in 1944 by architect Thomas Robert Gladwin from within the Department of Public Works. It copied the architectural details from the original section. In order to make room for the extension, the playshed was relocated on the site further south, adjacent to the western boundary. In 1952 the Oslo Lunch Room was converted for domestic science lessons. The verandah was enclosed with vertical timber boards and glass louvre windows to form a teacher's room and fitting room and a laundry. Casement windows with operable fanlights were added to the eastern gable end wall and high-level glass louvres were added to the west gable end wall. New doors and built-in sinks and joinery were added. In 1964 the Oslo Lunch Room was converted for use as a tuckshop. In 1955 two allotments fronting Ruthven Street (part of the original school site sold in 1906) were acquired and incorporated into the school grounds. Here, an infants' wing was constructed in two stages between 1957 and 1959 and opened by the Minister for Education, Jack Pizzey, in October 1959. The building was a standard design by architects within the Department of Public Works. It was a long and narrow two-storey building with open play space and one classroom on the ground level and classrooms on the upper level accessed by a verandah along the northern side. It was a brick, timber and concrete structure with a timber-framed gable roof. It had banks of timber- framed awning windows on the southern elevation, providing a high level of natural light and ventilation to the classrooms. It was connected to the western end of the main building via a ground-level covered walkway. This walkway was reconfigured in 1962 to be two storeys and include toilets, a staff room, a health services room and a store room. In March 1960 a plaque mounted on the new infants' wing was unveiled by Director of Primary Education, Arch Guymer. It dedicated the wing to recently retired Aileen Wadley, who taught at Toowoomba South Girls' and Infants' State School from 1 January 1938 to 31 December 1959. The building was called the \\"Wadley Wing\\". In 1977 the verandah was enclosed with aluminium-framed sliding windows and a ground-floor extension accommodating a janitor's room was added to the southern side of the wing in 1979. Alterations were made to the first floor of the main building in 1960. This included removing a folding partition and inserting a new partition to create a teacher's room and a larger classroom. Further alterations to this building were made in 1972 when the first and second floor hat and cloak rooms were converted for use as a staff room, a reading room, and general space. The provision of outdoor play space was a result of the early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school. Trees and gardens were planted as part of beautification of the school. In the 1870s, schools inspector William AJ Boyd was critical of tropical schools and amongst his recommendations was the importance of the addition of shade trees in the playground. In addition, Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890. Landscape elements were often constructed to standard designs and were intrinsic to Queensland Government education philosophies. Educationalists believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline, developed aesthetic tastes and inspired people to stay on the land. Aesthetically-designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors. The site of Toowoomba South State School has been landscaped over time to include trees, playing fields, courts, gardens, hardstand areas, shelters, and play structures. The school celebrated Arbor Day from 1890 and school activities have always involved the grounds, including parades, assemblies, sports days, and wider community social events like fetes and concerts. In 1958 extensive concrete retaining walls were constructed at the boundaries of the school and the earth was banked to create level areas for sports and to improve drainage. On 30 October 1965 the school celebrated its centenary and a souvenir booklet was published for the event. A fete day was held and included various entertainments, the unveiling of a memorial in the grounds by Minister for Transport, Gordon Chalk, a tree planting ceremony, and an afternoon tea for past students. The Kath Dickson Art Gallery, comprising works presented by the Toowoomba Art Society, was also opened within the brick building by MLA for Toowoomba East, Mervyn Anderson. Kath Dickson taught at the school between 1937-1941 and 1946-1950 before returning as Principal from 1960 to 1975. During her time at the school she actively encouraged pupil involvement in cultural activities such as art. Between the 1960s and the 1980s a modernisation of Queensland education occurred. The Education Act 1964 was a turning point and the first major update of Queensland education's governing legislation since 1875. Effectively, a new era of state education evolved with new architectural responses needed. The Department of Education (as it had been renamed in 1957) continued to give the responsibility of building design to the architects of the Department of Public Works. Due to new materials, technologies, educational philosophies, government policies, architectural styles and functional requirements, the evolution of standard designs became more fragmented. Rather than \\"improving\\" on the previous designs, architects began to design on a relatively clean slate, inspired by new precedents. Fundamentally, timber construction was no longer favoured and buildings were no longer predominantly high-set. In 1975 a new library building was constructed at Toowoomba Girls' and Infants' State School. This was a \\"System IB74\\", a standard building designed by Codd Hopgood Industrial Architects, and was a concrete slab-on-ground, prefabricated steel structure. The open-air annexe was moved to make room for the library construction. It was relocated at the southern end of the site, near the western boundary. It was oriented so that the verandah faced west and was low-set on concrete stumps. The teacher's room was removed from the verandah at this time and possibly became a pavilion for the nearby tennis courts. The enclosed verandah was altered to accommodate a toilet at the northern end which was later removed. A 1975 site plan shows that between 1960 and 1975 the school grounds had expanded to include additional allotments on the western side facing Ruthven Street. On 1 March 1983 the nearby Toowoomba South Boys' State School was closed and the boys were amalgamated into the girls' and infants' school, which was renamed Toowoomba South State School. Minor alterations to the toilets in the understorey of the 1941 building were undertaken during this transition. A large concrete and steel covered games area was constructed to the south of the 1941 brick building. In 1990 the school celebrated its 125th anniversary of establishment and an anniversary souvenir booklet was published for the event. In 1999 further alterations were made to the 1941 brick building. The westernmost classroom on the second floor was enlarged by partially removing the corridor wall and this space was incorporated into the classroom. At the same time, alterations were made to the Wadley Wing, including removing sections of the verandah wall, removing partitions, and inserting new partitions to create a withdrawal room and an art space. Later the SEDUce (Special Education Development Unit) become part of Toowoomba South, giving the school 3 sections SEDU, Preschool and Primary School. The SEDU was relocated away from Toowoomba South in 2007 following the introduction of the Prep year. In 2006, a regional group of ESL (English as a Second Language) support teachers were added to the school. 2007 saw the preschool folded into the main school as part of the introduction of Prep Year in Queensland. During the Australian Government's Building Education Revolution (BER) program, Toowoomba South State School received funding of $850,000 for the construction of a new Multi-Purpose hall. The BER program was the key element of the Australian Government's $42 billion \\"Nation Building - Economic Stimulus Plan\\", developed in response to the global financial crisis. The hall, situated along the Ruthven Street side of the school was completed in 2012. In recent years, enrolment figures at the school have declined to around 70 in 2013. Cultural diversity is a feature of the school, with approximately 50% of students having English as a second language or identifying with Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander cultures. The school also is the base for a Regional ESL (English as a Second Language) team who service schools in the Darling Downs and South-West area. In May 2013 the school was publicly announced by the State Government as one of nine across the state identified for possible closure by the Department of Education as part of its \\"school viability assessment\\". Community responses have included the establishment of a SOS (Save Our School) Committee, protests by the school's Parents and Citizens Association, and online campaigns against the school's closure. On 17 September 2013 Education Minister John-Paul Langbroek announced the school would close at the end of 2013. The school retains buildings that were built and altered in accordance with an evolving educational philosophy. Since opening in 1865, it has taught generations of Toowoomba students and has been a place of employment for many teachers and other staff. It has been a key social focus for the local school community with the grounds and buildings the location of many social events over time.  Description  Toowoomba South State School is situated on a major thoroughfare on the fringe of the central business district of Toowoomba. The 1.5ha site is adjacent to the intersection of the New England and Warrego Highways and is a neighbour to St Patricks Cathedral. The school buildings comprise: a three-storey brick building; the Wadley Wing; the Oslo Lunch Room; the open-air annexe; the playshed; a library; a covered games area; and a multi-purpose hall. = The main building (1941, rear extension 1949) = Fronting James Street to the north is an imposing three-storey classroom building designed in a Neo-Classical style with a grand character and landmark attributes. The building sits at a distance from the front boundary with a central concrete path and steps leads to the front entrance of the building. The building is symmetrically composed and comprises an understorey at ground level and two upper levels of classrooms. The exterior is rendered and scored to imitate coursed ashlar at ground level and has fine facebrick upper levels in English bond. A projecting central entrance bay with decorative pediment is flanked by wings with projecting end pavilions. The facade has rhythmic banks of timber-framed casement windows with fanlights on the first and second levels. The timber- framed hipped and gable roof is clad with corrugated metal sheets and has a prominent, decorative, metal ventilation fleche. The loadbearing structure supports a timber floor on steel bearers and concrete floors in the circulation spaces. Entrance to the main (first) level is via a split stair with an iron balustrade to a large central door comprising two leaves with moulded panels, glazed fanlight, and rendered architrave and hood. A wide, short hall leads to the main perpendicular corridor. The hall has moulded concrete skirtings, rendered walls, timber plate rail, and sheet-and-battens ceiling. A wall-mounted plaque commemorates the building's opening. A teacher's room is on either side of the hall. The first and second floors comprise classrooms, teacher's rooms, store rooms, and hat and cloak rooms, accessed from a wide corridor running the length of the northern side. The corridor has rendered walls and north-facing timber-framed casement windows and fanlights that retain original brass hardware. The wall between corridor and classroom has timber-framed double-hung sashes and awning sash fanlights; all retain original brass hardware. The ceiling of the first floor corridor is concrete with moulded concrete cornice and the ceiling of the second floor corridor is sheet-and-battens with timber cornice. The classrooms have rendered walls with moulded timber skirtings, architraves, and plate rails. The ceilings are sheet-and- battens with timber cornice. The ceilings of the second level have a central timber lattice ventilation panel. Two stairwells provide vertical circulation. The stairs are red-painted concrete with an unpainted perimeter and the balustrades are decorative iron with a moulded clear-finished timber handrail. In the stair halls the perimeter of the concrete floor is coved to the wall and small store rooms are located under the stairs. The understorey accommodates a large central play space and ablutions at either end, low-level bag and hat hooks, timber perimeter seats, and chalkboards. The floor is concrete and the walls are glazed facebrick rounded at corners. The toilets retain original timber cubicles, windows, and sheet-and-battens ceilings. = The Wadley Wing (1959) = Connected by a glazed, high-set corridor to the western end of the main building is the Wadley Wing. This long, narrow, timber-framed building is clad with facebrick and has a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. The building is divided approximately in half into two adjoined sections, with the western section set at a lower level. The eastern section of the building is high-set on timber trusses. The understorey accommodates one classroom and a facebrick ablutions block. The western section of the building is high-set on round concrete columns. Enclosed on the southern side by a later masonry wall and glass louvres, the understorey accommodates an open play area with a concrete floor and a timber perimeter seat. The two sections are connected by a central stair hall. Another stair hall is located at the western end of the wing with a door out into a small yard to Ruthven Street, forming a secondary entrance into the school. The stair halls have timber stairs, unpainted timber floors, facebrick and chamferboard walls, raked ceilings lined with sheet material, and are brightly-lit by timber-framed, fixed, opaque glazing. The upper level verandah runs the length of the northern side providing access to south-facing classrooms. The verandah is enclosed with aluminium-framed sliding windows, has a balustrade of bag racks, and a raked ceiling lined with sheet material and rounded cover strips. The verandah wall of the western portion retains chamferboard lining and banks of original timber-framed, double-hung sash windows with pivot-hung fanlights (all with original hardware), but modern doors. The verandah wall of the eastern portion has been altered by the insertion of large openings, removing all windows and doors. The south walls of the classrooms have large banks of timber-framed awning sash windows that retain original hardware. The classroom floors are timber and the walls and flat ceiling are lined with sheet material with rounded cover strips. The partition walls of the western portion are not original nor in their original locations. The partitions of the eastern portion have large concertina doors to combine the rooms into one large space. = The Oslo Lunch Room (1945) = Located to the south of the main building is the Oslo Lunch Room, a small, timber-framed building low-set on concrete and steel stumps. It has an enclosed north-facing (front) verandah and comprises one large room. The exterior is clad with sheet material with timber cover battens. The verandah is enclosed with chamferboards and aluminium-framed sliding windows. It has a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. The side and rear elevations have banks of timber-framed casement windows with awning sash fanlights. Entry is via two sets of steel and timber stairs onto the verandah, which has a timber floor and a ceiling lined on the rake with v-jointed timber boards. The verandah has a small room at either end formed by walls of single-skin, timber, v-jointed boards. These rooms retain early timber doors with glazed panels and fanlights as well as timber shelving and a sink. A large opening has been inserted in the verandah wall. The room has a timber floor and the walls and ceilings are lined with sheet material with timber cover battens. The room has modern built-in kitchen furniture that is not of cultural heritage significance. = The playshed (1884) = A playshed stands in the grounds to the south of the Oslo Lunch Room. It is a timber-framed shelter with a concrete floor and a hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. The southern and western sides are sheeted with corrugated iron that shields a timber perimeter seat that runs on these sides. = The open-air annexe (1913) = To the south of the playshed near the southern boundary of the site, stands the open-air annexe. This timber-framed building is low-set on concrete stumps and comprises one large classroom and an enclosed western (front) verandah. The walls are clad with weatherboards that have ventilation slots in the gable end apexes. The weatherboards wrap the ends of the enclosed verandah forming the original hat rooms. The remainder of the verandah is enclosed with sheet material with timber cover battens and sliding, timber-framed windows. The other elevations have timber-framed casements, some with small timber- framed fanlights, and the windows of the gable ends have small metal hoods. The gable roof, which is continuous over the verandah, is clad with corrugated metal sheets and has timber gable fretwork. The roof has wide eaves and the soffit is lined with v-jointed timber boards with meshed ventilation slots. Entry is at either end of the verandah via steel and timber stairs to glazed timber doors. The verandah has a timber floor and a timber v-jointed board ceiling. The wall between the verandah and the classroom is single skin with the framing, which has chamfered edges, exposed into the verandah. The verandah wall has timber-framed colonial-hung sashes with awning sash fanlights. Original double leaf timber doors with original hardware open into the classroom at both ends of the verandah. The classroom is a large space with a timber floor and the walls and coved ceiling are lined with timber v-jointed boards. An iron tie rod is exposed within the space at ceiling level. The ceiling has a central ventilation opening. The windows retain original hardware. To the east nearby is a timber-framed pavilion used as a tennis shed. This measures approximately , is open on one side, and is clad with weatherboards. It has a timber-framed skillion roof clad with corrugated metal sheets, is unlined internally, and has two unglazed window openings. This pavilion is probably the teacher's room added to the open-air annexe in 1929 and removed in 1975. Also on the site are a steel and concrete library building (1975), a steel and concrete covered games area (1983), and a steel and concrete multi-purpose hall (2012); none of which are of cultural heritage significance. = The Grounds = The school grounds are banked and levelled to create playing areas and incorporate long, low concrete retaining walls. Large, mature trees, including pepperinas (Schinus molle), camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora), and jacarandas (Jacaranda mimosifolia) stand within the grounds. A timber seat around the base of a camphor laurel has memorial plaques mounted on it. The plaques are dedicated to past students who have died. A stone cairn with a plaque, a memorial of the 1965 centenary, stands in the garden near the front stair of the main building below a steel flagpole attached to the stair balustrade. Behind the main building is a large bitumen parade area.  Heritage listing  Toowoomba South State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 December 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Toowoomba South State School (established in 1865 as Toowoomba National School) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education in Queensland and the associated evolution of government education architecture. One of the oldest public schools established in Queensland, Toowoomba South State School retains a significant complex of buildings and landscape elements that illustrate the development of government education philosophies from the 1880s to the 1950s. Reserved for school purposes in 1853, the important buildings and landscape elements from the 1880s to the 1950s demonstrate the growth and development of Toowoomba as a major regional centre in Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The open-air annexe at Toowoomba South State School, which remains relatively intact, is rare as one of the few surviving examples of this once common type. The Oslo Lunch Room, which also remains relatively intact, is and has always been uncommon as only a few buildings were built to this standard design and survived subsequent periods of development and change. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Toowoomba South State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of Queensland state schools, comprising a complex of buildings constructed to standard designs by the Department of Public Works, and standing on a large, landscaped site with buildings positioned to allow natural ventilation and daylighting of the interiors. The place retains good, representative examples of standard government designs that were architectural responses to the prevailing government educational philosophies. In particular, the standard designs represented at Toowoomba are: the playshed with its open sides, hipped timber-framed roof form supported on braced, timber posts and fixed timber perimeter seating; the open-air annexe with its timber-framed and clad construction, west facing verandah, large single classroom that is well ventilated and daylit, timber linings and iron tie rod; the Oslo Lunch Room with its timber-framed and sheet and battens clad construction, north facing verandah, south-facing fenestration and interior sheets and battens linings; the main building with its neo-classical styling, three-storeyed form, high- quality design, materials and construction, plan layout with north facing corridor, teacher's rooms, hat and cloak rooms, south facing classrooms that are well ventilated and daylit and understorey play space; and the Wadley Wing with its high-set form, gable roof, composite structural system and cladding, north facing verandah, south facing classrooms that are well ventilated and daylit and understorey play space. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place is important for its aesthetic significance brought about by the intact main building with its neo-classical styling (including proportions, scale, composition and detail), and its high-quality design, construction and materials. The place also has landmark attributes being sited on a major thoroughfare and contributes to the townscape of Toowoomba. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Toowoomba South State School has a strong, special, and ongoing association with the Toowoomba community. It was established through the efforts and funds of the people of the town in 1865 and has taught generations of Toowoomba children. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of Toowoomba and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social events with widespread community support.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 30, 2006. Plot The Simpsons and many other prominent Springfieldians go to see a performance of Stab-a-Lot: The Itchy & Scratchy Musical. The audience greets the performance with a standing ovation. Julianna, the show's director, and a former student of Springfield Elementary School, greets the reception along with Principal Skinner. Principal Skinner acknowledges Julianna's straight A's at the school, but attributes her \\"B or two\\" in Math to being a girl. The audience is outraged by Skinner's remark. Skinner's attempts to defend himself make the situation worse and he is beaten by the Itchy and Scratchy puppeteers. The next day, the teachers of Springfield Elementary and other ladies stage a protest outside the school against Skinner. To pacify them, Skinner holds a conference in the school's auditorium, inviting all protesting ladies to attend. Nothing he says or does (such as wearing a skirt and saying that men and women are equal but not identical) has a good effect on the ladies, so he has a new breakdown onstage. Chalmers introduces them to their new principal. Melanie Upfoot, who for her first act, segregates the school across gender lines. At first, Lisa seems to feel right at home in the girl-friendly school. But she grows disillusioned with the school's condescending attitude and spies on the boy's side, where actual, challenging math is taught. Skinner, now an assistant to Groundskeeper Willie, chases Lisa away. With the help of Marge, she disguises herself as a boy named Jake Boyman (nicknamed \\"Toilet\\" by the boys after toilet paper is stuck to the sole of the shoe) and attends the boys’ school. During the math class, she gives a wrong answer and is corrected by Martin, but she feels happy to have learned something. Unfortunately, being with the boys means having to act like one and, during lunch, Lisa inadvertently gets into a fight with Nelson. Despite her efforts to use her intelligence to escape her situation, she gets beaten up. When Bart returns home that day, he is happy to have seen a fight and runs upstairs to tell Lisa, only to discover that Lisa is the boy who got beat up. While he remains amused that his sister is actually \\"Toilet\\" he forcefully says \\"no one should be forced to be a girl\\" and that he'll help her blend into the boy's school. Lisa begins to pick up the code of the boys, including eating French fries that fell onto a dirty restaurant floor and punching a defenseless Ralph Wiggum; this last act wins over Nelson and the other bullies and \\"Jake Boyman\\" becomes an accepted part of their world. Lisa does well in math class, and at an awards ceremony is recognized for her outstanding performance in the subject. She then reveals her true identity to the whole school, and she explains why she had to disguise herself. Bart gets up and tells everyone that she did well only because she was acting like a boy. After that the boys all engage in a chair fight. Lisa walks off stage to Martin playing the flute, but quietly sneaks up behind him and hits him with a chair. A subplot of the episode involves Homer and Marge's relationship where, during the morning after the incident, Marge tries to cheer Lisa up by pointing out the contributions of the women to society. When Homer and Bart interfere with the conversation remarking that the men are more important than the women, Marge retaliates by forcing Homer to sleep on the couch. The next night, Homer tries to apologize for his sexism, but lacks both intellect and sensitivity to do this and is once again forced to sleep on the couch. When Homer tries to get comfort from Santa's Little Helper, he unwittingly insults him by claiming that he is dumber than he himself. The offended dog then kicks Homer out of the house and forces him to sleep in his dog house, where Homer wonders what he did to deserve these punishments.

He was also among the first Dreyfusards. Youth He was born Lazare Marcus Manassé Bernard (he later switched his first name and last name) in Nîmes on 15 June 1865, the eldest of four sons of Jonas Bernard and Douce Noémie Rouget. This bourgeois family had introduced the Jacquard loom to Toulouse, and founded one of the first (and very successful) textile mills, producing draperies and passementeries. The family was Jewish, and although not very religious, still celebrated the traditional holidays. Lazare received his baccalauréat in science, but his passion lay in literature, a passion which he shared with his friend, the poet Ephraïm Mikhaël. It was Mikhaël who, while studying in Paris at the École des Chartes encouraged Bernard to join him and conquer the literary world. Lazare arrived in Paris in 1886, the year in which Édouard Drumont's antisemitic pamphlet Jewish France (La France Juive) was published. Lazare signed up at the École pratique des hautes études (Practical School of Higher Studies). He attended lectures by the abbot Louis Duchesne, for whom the Catholic Institute of Paris created a chair of History of the Church. Lazare's rigour and insistence on precision, his ability to call into question supposedly established facts, had undoubtedly influenced Duchesne, whose History of the Ancient Church (l'Histoire de l'église ancienne) was placed on the Papal index and who reproached Lazare for writing like a \\"historian\\" and not a \\"theologian\\". In 1888, together with Ephraïm Mikhaël, Lazare wrote La Fiancée de Corinthe, a mythological drama in three acts, where he first adopted his nom de plume, Bernard Lazare. Two years later Ephraïm Mikhaël died of tuberculosis. It was around this time that Lazare became actively engaged in anarchism. Although he never took \\"direct action\\", he always continued to support its ideals and his comrades, whose publications and legal defences he financed. It was as an anarchist that he became a literary critic and journalist (his articles were later published in several collections). During the Trial of the thirty in 1894, he defended the anarchists Jean Grave and Félix Fénéon (also a painter).Ressusciter Lazare , Le Monde libertaire, 29 January 2004 He then covered the 1895 miners' revolt in Carmaux for the Écho de Paris. In 1896 he attended the Socialist Congress in London, where he denounced Karl Marx as \\"a jealous authoritarian, unfaithful to his own ideas, driving the Internationale away from its goals\\". Dreyfus Affair From 1892 onwards he was in contact with Achad Ha'am, one of the founders of the Lovers of Zion (Hovevei Tsyion) movement. In the spring of 1894 he published Anti- semitism, its History and Causes (L'Antisémitisme, son histoire et ses causes), an in-depth study and critique of the origins of antisemitism. It was published within a few months of the arrest of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish army officer accused of treason. Having a reputation for combativeness and courage, Bernard Lazare was contacted by Mathieu Dreyfus to help prove his brother's innocence. Lazare devoted his time exclusively to the case. He published his first paper, The Dreyfus Affair – A Miscarriage of Justice in Belgium in November 1896; it was in effect a complete rewrite of an earlier text which he had written at Mathieu's request in the summer of 1895. Basing it on an article in L'Eclair from the 15 September 1896 edition which revealed the illegality of the trial of 1894, Lazare refuted the accusation point by point and demanded the sentence be overturned. This tactic conformed more to the wishes of the Dreyfus family, as the first version of the text was a savage attack on the accusers, ending with the phrase \\"J'accuse\\", later made famous by Émile Zola. Due to this experience with antisemitism, Lazare became engaged in the struggle for the emancipation of Jews, and was triumphally received at the First Zionist Congress. He travelled with Zionist leader Theodor Herzl, the two men sharing a great respect for each other, but he fell out with Herzl after a disagreement over the project whose \\"tendencies, processes and actions\\" he disapproved. In 1899 he wrote to Herzl – and by extension to the Zionist Action Committee, \\"You are bourgeois in thoughts, bourgeois in your feelings, bourgeois in your ideas, bourgeois in your conception of society.\\" Lazare's Zionism was not nationalist, nor advocated the creation of a state, but was rather an ideal of emancipation and of collective organization of the Jewish proletarians.Gabriel Piterberg (2008), The Returns of Zionism: Myths, Politics and Scholarship in Israel, London: Verso, p.10 He visited Romania in 1900 and 1902, after which he denounced the terrible fate of Romanian Jews in L'Aurore, written in July and August 1900. He also visited Russia where he reported on the dangers facing Jews, but did not have a chance to publish due to illness; and Turkey where he defended the Armenians against persecution. In an 1898 writing in Pro Armenia, he did not hesitate to denounce the \\"Congrès Sioniste de Bâle\\" which had publicly honoured sultan Abdülhamid II: \\"Representatives of the oldest of persecuted peoples, whose history cannot be written, but in blood, send their salutations to the worst of assassins\\". Soon Dreyfusardes censored him and he could no longer write for l'Aurore after the Rennes trial. He covered the trial anyway and sent his vitriolic accounts to two American journals, The Chicago Record and The North American Review. At the end of his life, he became close to Charles Péguy, and wrote in the Cahiers de la quinzaine. He died on 1 September 1903, aged 38, following an operation for colon cancer. He left an unedited Manuscript, Job's Dungheap (Le fumier de Job), and authorised the republication of Anti-semitism, its History and Causes, on the condition that the preface state \\"my opinions have changed on many points\\".

Career  At the beginning of 1970 Shaw dreamed of becoming a rock guitarist. He bought himself a Gibson SG Special and started practicing. When the local band Cold Sweat was looking for a second guitarist in 1974, Shaw auditioned, but bass player Bill Kempster advised him to put down the guitar and to buy a mic from their old singer and come back the next week. Shaw followed up this advice, and when he auditioned as a singer the band hired him as their new vocalist. Cold Sweat toured extensively over the next three years, playing across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and into Manitoba. Their live set of a mixture of classic melodic rock soon became their calling card on the hotel, and live club scene. The changing music scene and popularity of discos caused the Victoria band to break up in 1977. In that same year, he was called to join Saskatoon based band Legend, who had lost their lead singer Danny Jeans. They had heard Shaw singing with Cold Sweat on many occasions and knew he would fit their needs. Shaw relocated to Stoon and stayed for nine months before Legend also resolved due to lack of live work. Shaw returned to Victoria to consider his next move. After weeks of contemplation, he decided to move to England and try his luck in London. In December 1978, Shaw boarded a plane and left Canada chasing a dream. On arriving in London he auditioned and got the job of lead singer with London-based band Paris founded by keyboard player and songwriter Phil Lanzon. A partnership that would last for years to come. Paris signed a record deal with RCA and changed their name to Grand Prix. Shaw sang on the album Grand Prix which was released in 1980. When Shaw returned from his sister's wedding in Canada in October 1981 he learned he had been replaced by Robin McAuley. Talk started of a 30-something-year reunion for Grand Prix following Uriah Heep's acclaimed performance at Childline Rocks (1 June 2009); several ex-members spoke for the first time since the unscheduled departure of Shaw, but they decided it was the right move to enlist McAuley as vocalist due to his superior voice. In December 1981, Shaw joined Praying Mantis, a band formed in 1978. Other band members were Tino Troy (guitar), Chris Troy (bass), Dave Potts (drums) and John Bavin (keyboards). The band was managed by Deep Purple manager John Coletta but they still had problems getting a record deal. Shaw did not record an album with Praying Mantis but did appear on the EP Turn The Tables, recorded in 1982. Praying Mantis primarily played live in various venues, including the Reading Festival. In 1993, a bootleg was going around called \\"live + singles\\" which contained six songs performed at the Reading Festival and other fragments and singles. From December 1983 to the middle of 1984, Shaw played in Clive Burr's Escape, a band started by ex-Iron Maiden drummer Clive Burr. Praying Mantis members Chris and Tino Troy were also in the group. Shortly after Shaw joined, the band went on as Escape. In July 1984, the band again chose a new name, Stratus. Like Praying Mantis, Stratus played melodic hard rock. The album Throwing Shapes was recorded at the Frankfurter Dreamboat studio with Tino Troy on guitar, Alan Nelson on keyboards, Chris Troy on bass, and Clive Burr on drums. It was released in the fall of 1984. In 1993, the CD version Reborn Classics was released. As a bonus track on this bootleg the Soundhouse Tapes are added. Stratus also had one song as a movie soundtrack. The song \\"Run For Your Life\\" is used in Class of Nuke 'Em High (1986, USA). When Stratus finally played their last gig at the London Marquee Club in the audience that night was Uriah Heep guitarist Mick Box. Uriah Heep's singer, Steff Fontaine, had just been fired, and Box was looking for a singer who could reach the high notes. Box asked Shaw to audition for Uriah Heep and then hired him as the band's new front man. Shaw and Mick Box, 9 May 2009 inSlavonski Brod, Croatia Shaw's first album with Heep was Live in Moscow. In 1995, Shaw had serious throat problems and it looked for a while as if Shaw would have to quit his singing career. For concerts in Austria and South Africa former Heep vocalist John Lawton was deputized. Shaw recovered after minor surgery. He is now the band's longest-serving vocalist. In December 1995, Shaw started a hobby band in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, called in Transit. Teaming up with former mates Don Restall, Kevin Williams, Steve Moyer, and guitarist Dale Collins, the band did cover versions of Van Halen, 38 Special, Dan Reed Network, Stage Dolls, Foreigner, Ritchie Sambora, and a few Uriah Heep songs. Due to his busy schedule, Bernie and in Transit played a limited number of shows in 1995 and early 1996. This led to the forming of the Collins~Shaw Project, with Bernie Shaw, Dale Collins, and Don Restall. During Bernies' next visit to Canada in 1997, the Collins~Shaw Project recorded and EP called Picking Locks, which was released the following year. The project also released a single called Sad Song. In August and September 1997, Shaw was in the Canadian Rock Ridge studios to sing on the album of his friend Kevin Williams, whom he knew from in Transit. It was a tribute album to Williams' wife who died of cancer around Christmas 1996. The CD was released in private by Kevin Williams for the Canadian market only. Bernie Shaw, as, in fact, all the current Uriah Heep's members, collaborated in 2001 with Romanian heavy- metal legends Iris, on a track called \\"Lady in Black\\" which had great success in Romania during that year.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 10, 2006. In the episode, Fat Tony is put out of commission by a rival family, and Homer and Bart take over the Springfield Mafia. The episode was written by Bill Odenkirk and directed by Michael Marcantel. Metallica guest star as themselves, while Michael Imperioli and Joe Pantoliano guest star as Fat Tony's enemies, Dante Jr. and Dante, respectively. In its original broadcast, \\"The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer\\" was watched by around 11.5 million people and received a 5.3 Nielsen rating. Plot Left to right: Hans Moleman, James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett and Robert Trujillo While driving the Springfield Elementary School's students to school, Otto stops to meet the members of Metallica, whose tour bus has broken down. Behind him, however, Bart takes over driving the school bus, embarrassing Otto in front of Metallica, who hitches a ride with Hans Moleman instead. At the school, a fuming Otto arrives and spanks Bart. Noticing this act of corporal punishment, Principal Skinner suspends Otto from driving the school bus. For this reason, Marge has to drive carpool to several of Bart and Lisa's friends. After picking up Milhouse Van Houten, Sherri, Terri, and Nelson, she finally picks up a boy named Michael. Michael, clearly an outcast with no friends, is bullied by Nelson in the car. He forgets his math book at home, prompting Marge to drive him back to pick it up. While there, his math book is handed to him by his father, Fat Tony. Terrified, Nelson immediately takes back all his insults. News of Michael's \\"family\\" spreads, and everyone tries to keep their distance from him. Some, like Ralph, are in fear because Fat Tony shot their parents. Lisa joins a lonely Michael at lunch, and they become friends. She finds that Michael is a talented cook and dreams of being a chef, rather than going into the family business of \\"waste management\\". While Fat Tony drives the children home from school, goons working for his rivals, the Calabresi family, attack them. Tony manages to slip them, and when they arrive at the Simpson house, Michael invites the family over for dinner at Fat Tony's mansion, where the Calabresis show up unexpectedly for a sit-down. Fat Tony advises the Calabresis against killing him as his son, Michael, would then take his place and exact a brutal vengeance. Michael, however, arrives, serving soufflés to the mobsters, who love it, but are surprised when they find out he made them. The Calabresis laugh at Fat Tony, calling Michael \\"Chef Boyaregay\\" and leave. Fat Tony admonishes Michael for making him look weak in front of his enemies. Suddenly, an attack helicopter appears at the window and guns Fat Tony down. Johnny Tightlips explains to the other mobsters that with Fat Tony in a coma, Michael should step up as mob boss, much to his dismay, but Homer volunteers to take his place. He proceeds to do Mafia dirty work, including plotting various ways to harm Ned, Moe and Krusty. However, Michael notices how this amount of power is corrupting Homer and Bart and seeks to put an end to it. One night, he invites the Calabresis to the Simpsons' for dinner, where he informs them that they have won and that he is out of the family business. They applaud his decision, but end up choking and dying over their own meals. Marge discovers the food had been poisoned, and although Michael appears remorseful, Lisa finds out it was intentional. At Fat Tony's mansion, Fat Tony congratulates Michael for taking down their enemies. Outside, Lisa asks Michael why he did not tell Fat Tony it was all an accident. Michael bluntly tells her to never ask him about his business, and disappears into a room with Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney, who closes the door in Lisa's face, as a reference to the ending in The Godfather. Lisa opens the door to see Michael and co. playing with Hot Wheels, only to have Kearney close the door on her again. Production The title is a reference to The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. Homer says the greatest mob film of all time was Shark Tale. The 2004 animated film took its general storyline from The Godfather although it transferred the material into a PG-rated animated film. The ending of the episode is a reference to the ending of The Godfather, including the music. Guest star Michael Imperioli was chosen for his role as Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. The Sopranos intro is played when Fat Tony and his crew drive through Springfield. Fat Tony's son Michael was first mentioned in \\"The Seven- Beer Snitch\\". The episode marks the return of the character Lunchlady Doris (now renamed Lunchlady Dora) to a speaking role after her original voice actor Doris Grau died in 1995. The character is now voiced by Tress MacNeille. Reception Dan Iverson of IGN wrote that the episode was \\"charming\\", and that he enjoyed its parody of The Godfather, praising Pantoliano and Imperioli's appearances. He also wrote that as the episode was too random, he missed the emotional impact it should have had, giving the episode a final rating of 7/10. In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed Metallica's performance as one of the 33 funniest cameos in the history of the show.
