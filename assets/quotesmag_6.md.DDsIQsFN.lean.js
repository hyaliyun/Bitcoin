It also intends to create a Project Rebirth Center to help educate responders and the public about dealing with such events. The organization was created in honor of the victims of the September 11 attacks and those who responded to the attacks. Founded by producer Jim Whitaker, the organization is supported by dozens of corporate donors, including Aon Foundation, OppenheimerFunds Inc., and Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. All profits from its documentary film Rebirth, officially released in January 2011, go to the support of the Project Rebirth Center. History Project Rebirth was inspired by Jim Whitaker's visit to Ground Zero with his wife. He told Huffington Post in 2011 that in the midst of his despair over the devastation, a glimmer of hope came to him when he realized that the site would not always look the way it did then. Wanting to convey those shifting emotions, he decided first to set up time-lapse cameras at the site to track its evolution, but gradually realized that telling the stories of the people involved was also important. Filming at the site began in March 2002. It was while showing the early edited footage to others that Whitaker's vision began to expand, and he realized that the film could have educational value in helping people learn from grief. From this realization, the idea of the Project Rebirth Center was developed. Filming lasted for eight years; the overall cost of making the documentary that resulted was $9.5 million. The filming resulted in 900 hours of tape; while less than a quarter percent of this went into the final film, the footage is being made available to agencies dedicated to dealing with such events, including mental health agencies, law enforcement and firefighters. Rebirth On January 23, 2011, Project Rebirth released the documentary Rebirth at the Sundance Film Festival. Originally, Whitaker, who directed, had intended to focus on the site solely, with a film to be included in a future museum, but told Filmmaker magazine in 2011 that his time at Ground Zero convinced him that the stories of the people needed to be told as well to \\"capture the human dimension of the event.\\" Although nine people were followed, the finished film focuses on the lives of five individuals: a teenager, Nick, whose mother died; a firefighter, Tim, who lost colleagues; a woman, Tanya, who lost her fianc√©; a woman, Ling, who has undergone over 40 surgeries to help deal with the devastation of the attack; and a construction worker, Brian, who is helping to rebuild. Early reception of the documentary was positive, with Sundance audiences responding with a standing ovation and film critic Kirk Honeycutt stating that \\"Every choice Whitaker has made, from his decision not to show any of the footage from that terrible day to whatever methods he used to get his heroes to express themselves so candidly, pays off beautifully. The word \\"inspiring\\" gets overused but 'Rebirth' is really and truly inspiring.\\" All profits from the documentary are to help fund the Project Rebirth Center. The documentary received a Peabody Award in 2011.http://www.peabodyawards.com/award- profile/rebirth References External links *Project Rebirth Category:September 11 attacks Category:501(c)(3) organizations Category:Documentary films about terrorism Category:Documentary films about the September 11 attacks ","title":"Project Rebirth"},{"id":"7676160","text":"William Waring Miller (November 1, 1912 ‚Äì November 13, 2008) was an American pole vaulter who won a gold medal at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

At the , Peak Hill had a population of 1,106 people. It is located on the Newell Highway and the Dubbo to Parkes railway line. History Before the arrival of Europeans, the Peak Hill area was part of the Wiradjuri people's lands. In 1817, the explorer John Oxley and his party were the first Europeans in the region. In 1889, Gold was discovered in the area, and later that year Peak Hill was gazetted in November 1889. The Post office opened on 7 November 1889, and the Bureau of Meteorology's weather station began in 1965. The first public wheat silo built in Australia was constructed at Peak Hill in 1918 after government surveys indicated the district had great potential as a wheat-producing region.\\"A History of Peak Hill and District\\", published by the Peak Hill Centenary book committee, 1989. Agriculture The district is also a renowned sheep producing area, particularly medium-woolled merinos. There are also four merino studs actively operating in the area, namely Cora Lynn, Genanegie, Towalba, and Westray. Rams from these studs have been sold throughout Australia, and they all have on-property hoggett ram sales in September, supplying commercial sheep breeders with high-quality young rams to breed from. Climate Facilities Peak Hill has a Catholic primary school St Joseph's, and a public central school. Peak Hill has three motels, one hotel and two caravan parks. It also has a post office, RSL club, bowling club, golf club, cafes, antique shops, newsagency, supermarket, butcher shop, art gallery, book shop, hairdressers and beauty salons. There is a showground that has harness races and an annual agricultural show. Peak Hill offers many tourist attractions such as the open cut gold mine, flora and fauna reserve nature walk, Bogan Weir, Australia's first upright wheat silo, heritage listed hospital, arts and crafts, Big Fish fossil hut, and a unique street facade which takes visitors back in time. The local community operates a volunteer-run radio station: PeakHillFM89.5. The station provides a round-the-clock service of classic hits seven days per week. Peak Hill styles itself as 'The Town With a Heart of Gold'. to reflect its proximity to the goldmine, and lends its facilities as a base for tourists of Wiradjuri Country. Silos Peak Hill's central position in the New South Wales wheat belt may have been the reason why Peak Hill became the site for Australia's first upright bulk wheat silo in 1918. It was not until 1927 that the next stage, the six-bin silos and weighbridge complex, was completed at Peak Hill. In 1950 the construction of three additional 50,000-bushel bins was carried out and the bulkhead was completed in 1959. After viewing the current silo, it will become apparent that they have grown substantially over the years to cope with the local grain production. A lot of locally grown grain is also taken over to the Parkes silo. The Peak Hill silo can be viewed from Lindner Avenue, which runs parallel with the railway line.

He played among hearing players at the highest level in Europe, despite being deaf since birth. He is a 2.05 m (6 ft 8¬æ in) power forward who can also play center when needed. He is the only deaf person to play in professional basketball league and in the EuroCup. Miha Zupan has competed at the Deaflympics on 5 occasions from 1997-2017. Early years Zupan spent most of his childhood in a special school for the deaf, eventually learning to speak. A type of hearing aid would later give him enough hearing to understand speech. He did not learn to play basketball until age 14, instead playing football and volleyball. After his first basketball coach spotted him in a schoolyard, he took to the game quickly, soon joining Slovenia's national basketball team for the deaf, which twice made the finals of the European championships with Zupan as its star. He was selected to represent Slovenia at the Deaflympics in 1997 and competed in his maiden Deaflympic competition at the age of 15. He was part of the Slovenian deaf basketball team which finished 5th in the 1997 Summer Deaflympics. At the age of 17, he signed his first contract with a regular professional team, KD Slovan of Ljubljana. During his teenage years, he grew 20 cm (8 inches) in an 18-month period, leading to knee problems that sidelined him for several months early in his pro career. Professional career Miha Zupan in Spartak Saint Petersburg At Slovan he developed into a promising big man, soon making the (regular) Slovenia junior and under-20 national teams. He played in the Slovenian League All-Star Game in 2004 and 2006, earning MVP honors in the 2004 game and also winning the slam dunk contest associated with the 2004 game. He continued to play for the Slovenia national deaf team, leading them to the 2004 European championship. Miha Zupan was also the member of the national basketball team which claimed silver medals at the 2001 Summer Deaflympics and at the 2005 Summer Deaflympics. In the 2005-06 season with Slovan, he averaged 11.5 points and 4.4 rebounds in Slovenian League play. His statistics in the Adriatic League were arguably more impressive, considering that he played only 23 minutes per game in that competition; he averaged 13.2 points and 3.9 rebounds and also shot 47.3% from three-point range. Zupan signed with Union Olimpija, also of Ljubljana, in the 2006 offseason, fulfilling what he called one of his lifelong dreams. He also barely missed out on a trip to the 2006 FIBA World Championship, becoming the last player cut from the Slovenia squad. His chance to play for Olimpija in the Euroleague was on hold for several months because his transfer became the subject of litigation between them and Slovan. He had, apparently inadvertently, failed to revoke his contract with Slovan before signing with Olimpija. Olimpija had registered him at the start of the 2006-07 season, and he played six fixtures in the Adriatic League before Slovan contested the registration. Olimpija won the first round of the legal battle in August 2006, but on October 23, an appellate court set aside the decision and ordered a new trial. Olimpija announced that it would appeal the ruling. This ruling also, for the time being, prevented him from becoming the first deaf player ever to play in the Euroleague, as he had been scheduled to play in Olimpija's first game of Euroleague regular-season play against Croatian side Cibona on October 26, 2006. (Note the absence of Zupan from the Olimpija team listing.) The legal battle raged until late February 2007, when Olimpija and Slovan reached a settlement. After Olimpija paid an undisclosed fee to Slovan, they finally registered him officially on March 1. The settlement proved timely for Olimpija, as they had seen six players leave the team during the season, and had two other players out with injury. While Zupan was unable to play during the 2006-07 Euroleague, as Olimpija had been eliminated by the time of the settlement, he arrived in time for the late rounds of the Adriatic League and for the second stage of the Slovenian domestic league. On October 24, 2007, Zupan finally became the first deaf player in the Euroleague, appearing for Olimpija in their 80-52 loss at Montepaschi Siena in the opening week of regular season play in the 2007-08 Euroleague. He had 5 points, 3 rebounds, and 2 assists in slightly over 13 minutes of action off the bench.

The film was written by Zombie and Tom Papa from Zombie's comic book series of the same name, serving as a sidequel to his Firefly film series. The film was produced by Starz Media and Film Roman, with animation provided by Carbunkle Cartoons and Big Star Productions. The film stars Papa, Sheri Moon Zombie, Paul Giamatti, Tom Kenny, Rosario Dawson and Brian Posehn. Papa voices the character of El Superbeasto and Moon Zombie voices sidekick sister, Suzi-X. Unlike the other Firefly films, this film is animated and has a more cartoony comical approach to it. The film was released straight-to-DVD on September 22, 2009 and theatrically in some international territories. Plot The film follows the adventures of El Superbeasto (Tom Papa), a suave, yet violent exploitation film actor/director and former masked wrestler, and his sultry \\"sidekick\\" and sister, the super-agent Suzi-X (Sheri Moon Zombie), as they race to prevent the evil Dr. Satan (Paul Giamatti) from taking over the world by marrying the foul-mouthed stripper with the mark of the devil on her backside, Velvet Von Black (Rosario Dawson). The adventure, set in the mythic world of Monsterland, also features Murray the Robot (Brian Posehn), Suzi-X's sidekick and vehicle, based on the robot featured in the 1939 serial The Phantom Creeps starring Bela Lugosi.THE HAUNTED WORLD OF EL SUPERBEASTO (DVD REVIEW) Cast * Tom Papa as El Superbeasto * Sheri Moon Zombie as Suzi-X * Paul Giamatti as Dr. Satan / Steve Wachowski * Tom Kenny as Rover / Otto / Old Man / Herbie * Rosario Dawson as Velvet Von Black * Brian Posehn as Murray the Robot * Dee Wallace as Trixie * Ken Foree as Luke St. Luke * Geoffrey Lewis as Lenny Crumpski / Roy Sullivan * Lew Temple as Adam Banjo * Rob Paulsen as Michael / Bobby Hyde / Commandant Hess / El Gato / Grossburger / Creature Preacher * Daniel Roebuck as Morris Green * Danny Trejo as Boss Rico * Cassandra Peterson as Amber * Debra Wilson as Cigarette Girl / Bride Frankenstein / Female Patron / Stripper in Hall / Telephone Victim / Old Woman * Clint Howard as Joe Cthulhu * Kevin Michael Richardson as Santa Baby * April Winchell as Dame Grace Appleton / Liza / Babs / Dolly / Joan / Gloria / Scripty / Helga Strudel * John DiMaggio as Burt the Spurt * Laraine Newman as Lefty / Kate / Courtney / Smelga Strudel / Betty Sue Lou * Jess Harnell as Soundy / Cameraman / Astronaut / Willey the Worm / Uncle Carl * Charlie Adler as Krongar / Mooney McMoon / Albino Singer * Joe Alaskey as Van Sloan / Jack / Erik the Newscaster * Harland Williams as Gerard the Exterminator * Carlos Alazraqui as Bennie Rodriguez * Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding * Bill Moseley as Otis Driftwood * Tura Satana as Varla * Dee Bradley Baker as Nazi zombie * Rodger Bumpass as Screaming patron * Jeff Bennett as Nerdy patron Production Work began on The Haunted World of El Superbeasto in 2006 and a release date was later scheduled for May 2007, but the film was completed in 2009. In an interview conducted on July 20, 2007 by shocktillyoudrop.com, Zombie explained that, \\"Nothing really much [is happening].\\" During that time, the film was still being animated, however, Zombie then began work on Halloween. He informed the animators that he had \\"to walk away because I can't split my time between two things\\". Zombie noted that work on The Haunted World of El Superbeasto \\"started when I was on Rejects and it's now just sitting on a shelf waiting for me to finish Halloween\\". In a November 2007 interview with Bloody Disgusting, Zombie announced that the film was \\"almost finished\\". He went on to say that, although he was then on tour until February, \\"we will finally finish the music on Superbeasto and it'll be done\\" afterwards. Rob Zombie had the following to say in a September 28, 2008, posting on the official El Superbeasto Myspace page: \\"We're down to the end! 3 long years in the making and worth every second. By Halloween this thing will be in the can completely DONE!\\" According to a blog post on October 29, 2008, Defamer Magazine was privy to a \\"sneak peek\\" at scenes from The Haunted World of El Superbeasto, about which they said \\"it's good to know that if WALL-E falls short on its quest for Oscar gold, we now have another animated contender.\\" In an October 29, 2008, Blender Magazine interview, Rob Zombie stated that \\"I've been working on [El Superbeasto] for three years, and I'm actually in the last weeks of it ‚Äî I'm mixing the sound this week. I'm not sure of the release date yet, but that'll be out probably early 2009. It's a full-length adult animated comedy.\\" The film was screen-tested for a 2009 release by Anchor Bay Entertainment. IGN's March 20, 2009 exclusive interview with Rob Zombie revealed that \\"[The Haunted World of El Superbeasto] was finished, but its release had been delayed because of ownership and legal issues within the company that made the movie, Starz Media.\\" In that same interview, Rob Zombie described the film as \\"Awesome...this little tiny half-a-million dollar direct-to-video movie that expanded into this $10 million animated extravaganza. And it's awesome, but I don't have a release date yet. It's like an R-rated adult/monster/sex comedy. There's nothing really like it that I can think of. People always say like Ralph Bakshi's stuff, but...it's [more] like if SpongeBob and Scooby-Doo were filthy.\\" The film, running feature length at 75 minutes, was released on DVD on September 22 of that year. A majority of the songs in the film are written and performed by Chris Hardwick and Mike Phirman's comedy duo Hard 'n Phirm. Director Rob Zombie also references several other films. Tom Papa, writer and the voice of the titular character, incorporated his style of humor into his character. Throughout the film, El Superbeasto often makes observations at unusual moments, like Papa does in his stand-ups. Reception El Superbeasto received mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received a 40% approval rating from five critics, with an average score of 5.38/10.

Constructed in 1925, the bridge is designed to rise to let paddle steamers through. In 1974, the paddle steamer \\"Pevensey\\" collided with the bridge after passing through the open bridge heading upstream. The steamer attempted to move to the south bank after clearing the bridge, but was caught in the strong current and swept sideways into the east side of the bridge. The bridge sustained no noticeable damage, but the \\"Pevensey\\" suffered some damage to her upper works. After being pulled off by a team of locals who were gathered to see her come through the bridge, the \\"Pevensey\\" refueled and made minor repairs, before heading upstream to Echuca. Culture The town in conjunction with nearby township Manangatang has an Australian rules football team competing in the Central Murray Football League. The town first established a football team in 1903, in the Lines Football Association. This became the Nyah-Piangil Football Association soon after, and Tooleybuc won its first Premiership in 1923, defeating Woorinen by 1 point. As a member of the Mid Valley Football Association, Tooleybuc won the Premiership in 1935. The Association became the Mid-Murray Football League, and Tooleybuc made the Grand Final on six occasions, but only managed one Premiership, when they defeated Lalbert by 32 points in 1965. In 1997, a re- organisation of football leagues in the area resulted in the creation of the Central Murray Football League.

It serves to direct the documentation of audit working papers in order to assist the audit planning and performance; the supervision and review of the audit work; and the recording of audit evidence resulting from the audit work in order to support the auditor's opinion. ISA 230 statements The auditor should prepare, on a timely basis, audit documentation that provides: #A sufficient and appropriate record of the basis for the audit report #Evidence that the audit was performed in accordance with ISA's and applicable legal and regulatory requirements (Paragraph 2).ISA 230 (UK) The auditor should prepare the audit documentation so as to enable an experienced auditor, having no previous connection with the audit, to understand: # The nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures performed to comply with ISAs and applicable legal and regulatory requirements; # The results of the audit procedures and the audit evidence obtained; # Significant matters arising during the audit and the conclusions reached thereon. (Paragraph 9) Oral explanations by the auditor, on their own, do not represent adequate support for the work the auditor performed or conclusions the auditor reached, but may be used to clarify or explain information contained in the audit documentation. (Paragraph 11) This is not true, Oral explanations are only referenced on paragraph 11 of AU section 339 therefore does not refer to ISA. The audit file must effectively stand on its own. Whilst the auditor may clarify what has been documented the facility to explain detailed aspects of the audit has gone, so this must mean more extensive working papers in some areas. In documenting the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures performed, the auditor should record the identifying characteristics of the specific items or matters being tested. (Paragraph 12) In documenting the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures performed, the auditor should record: # Who performed the audit work and the date such work was completed; and # Who reviewed the audit work performed and the date and extent of such review. (Paragraph 23) The standard also establishes clear responsibilities for the auditor to assemble the final audit file on a timely basis and sets out specific requirements regarding deletions, modifications or additions to audit documentation after the date of the auditor's report. There are also documentation requirements in the exceptional circumstance when an auditor judges it necessary to depart from a basic principle or essential procedure that is relevant in the circumstances of the audit. The auditor should document how the alternative procedures performed achieve the objective of the audit and, unless otherwise clear, the reasons for the departure.

The major business appraisal standards are these: * CICBV Practice Standards. Published by the CBV Institute. * Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). Standards 9 and 10 cover business valuation and reporting standards. Published by the Appraisal Foundation. * International Valuation Standards. Published by the International Valuation Standards Council. * Statement on Standards for Valuation Services (SSVS No 1). Published by the American Institute of CPAs. In addition, each of the three major United States valuation societies -- the American Society of Appraisers (ASA), American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (CPA/ABV), and the National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts (NACVA) -- has its own set of Business Valuation Guidelines, which it requires all of its accredited members to adhere to. The AICPA's standards are published as Statement on Standards for Valuation Services No.1 and the ASA's guidelines are published as the ASA Business Valuation Guidelines, which largely follow the USPAP Standard requirements. All AICPA members are required to follow SSVS1. Additionally, the majority of the State Accountancy Boards have adopted SSVS1 for CPAs licensed in their state.  Features  All of the standards have the following in common: ;A requirement of independence:The appraiser must not act in favor of the client or any other party. ;A requirement that fees be not contingent on appraised value:Fees based upon, for example, a percentage of the valuation are unethical and are not allowed. ;A requirement that all limiting conditions be explicitly stated:The reader must be informed of all assumptions made as part of the valuation. For example, if a lawsuit is pending against a business, the valuation must explicitly state that the impact of the outcome of the lawsuit will have an unknown effect on the value, and what assumptions about the outcome have or have not been made. ;A requirement that all people participating in the valuation be disclosed:All professionals participating in a valuation report must sign it, and must have certification of their independence, fee arrangements, and other factors. ;A requirement that all information sources be stated:Readers must be able to replicate valuation reports for themselves. Therefore, all sources used in compiling the report must be stated. ;Minimum requirements for contents of reports:The precise minimum requirements vary from society to society, but roughly they include the purpose and scope of the assignment, the standard of value and specific valuation date being employed, an identification of the specific interest being evaluated, the relevant state and federal laws that govern the entity being valued, the scope of the procedures employed during valuation, the nature and history of the business, the historical financial information on the business, a thorough financial analysis of the business comparing the business' performance with industry trends, an overview of the industry in which the business operates and the impact of market conditions on the business, and the current investment climate.  Concepts employed  This is a list of some of the common concepts employed in business valuation that are defined by business valuation standards. ;Marketability discount:In the ASA BVS, a marketability discount is \\"an amount or percentage deducted from an equity interest to reflect lack of marketability\\"  References   Further reading  * -- the full text of the Statement on Standards for Valuation Services No.1,ASA Business Valuation Standards, IBA Business Appraisal Standards, IBA Code of Ethics, IBA Business Valuation Guidelines, and NACVA Professional Standards Category:Fundamental analysis Category:Valuation (finance) Category:Valuation professionals ","title":"Business valuation standard"},{"id":"7676427","text":"Elia Zenghelis (Born 1937, Athens, Greece) is a Greek architect and teacher. He studied architecture at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, London, completing his studies in 1961. From 1961 to 1971 he worked for architects Douglas Stephen and Partners, London, while also (from 1963) teaching at the Architectural Association. Zenghelis became a prominent teacher at the school for introducing more radical avant-gardism into the curriculum. From 1971 to 1975 Zenghelis collaborated with various architects in London, Paris and New York: Georges Candilis, Michael Carapetian, Aristeides Romanos, Rem Koolhaas, O.M. Ungers and Peter Eisenman.  Metropolitanism  Zenghelis came to critical attention for his accomplishments while part of the Dutch architectural firm Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), which he founded in 1975 with Zoe Zenghelis, his wife, his former student Rem Koolhaas, and Madelon Vriesendorp, Koolhaas's wife. From 1980 to 1987, the male Zenghelis was partner in charge of OMA London; of OMA Athens from 1982 to 1987 OMA Athens. Out of OMA's projects during that period, Zenghelis was a central influence in earlier works: Extension of the Dutch Houses of Parliament, The Hague, 1978; Lutzowstrasse, IBA Berlin, 1981; Parc de la Villette, Paris, 1982; and Checkpoint Charlie housing, IBA Berlin, 1990. Several of the paintings that Elia Zenghelis made with Zoe Zenghelis to illustrate OMA projects‚Äîsuch as Hotel Sphinx (1975) and Sixteen Villas on the Island of Antiparos, Greece (1981)‚Äîare now included in the Art and Design collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  Mediterraneanism  Zenghelis' turn to designing bourgeois summer villas in Greece in the early 1980s marked a change in the dynamics of his work: the British architectural journal Architectural Design (no. 51, 1981) noted in regards to his houses in Antiparos, that \\"Since Elia Zenghelis and Rem Koolhaas formally founded OMA over six years ago, their work, recently described by Bob Maxwell ‚Äòas a series of paradoxes: reductivist yet metaphoric, polemical yet exquisite, modern, yet anti-modern‚Äô, has revealed subtle shifts of concern. This idiosyncratic evolution has now moved from Manhattanism to Mediterraneanism; their current project for a series of villas on Antiparos reflects a development of the OMA rationale skilfully crafted with Aegean traditions.\\" This evaluation is somewhat misleading, however, in that after this work Zenghelis still worked in projects in West Berlin, especially the urban infill, part of the IBA Berlin project, in which the city set up a series of invited architectural competitions among avant-gardist architects of the time (including Aldo Rossi, Peter Eisenman and Rob Krier) to design infills on sites throughout the city. OMA designed a structure adjacent to the infamous Checkpoint Charlie site - at a time when the border control was still operating. Gigantes Zenghelis Architects In 1987 Zenghelis went into partnership with architect Eleni Gigantes, in the office Gigantes Zenghelis Architects, London and Athens. From 2000 to 2011 they also had a branch office in Brussels, Belgium. However, from 1992 onward, Zenghelis withdrew from active participation in the office, and from design, in favour of his first and true vocation - education, which by then occupied him almost continuously. He continued to lecture on the work of the office however and make occasional contributions. The office's most prestigious and critically received completed scheme has been the Ashikita House of Youth (1996‚Äì1998) in Kumamoto, on the island of Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan, commissioned by Kumamoto ArtPolis. Education In 1989 he was appointed Baukunst Professor at the Kunstakademie in D√ºsseldorf (stepping into Jim Stirling's recently vacated chair), retiring in 2002. He also taught at the Berlage Institute in the Netherlands (1993‚Äì2010), and in 2003 was also appointed a member of its Board. From 1997 onward he also taught in Switzerland: as Guest Professor at EPFL in Lausanne (1997-8) and ETH in Zurich (1998‚Äì2000) and as Professor at the Accademia d'Architettura Mendrisio (2000‚Äì2007). He was appointed Professor Emeritus in different Schools of Architecture such as the one of University of Thessaly in Greece. In 2012 he taught master classes at The Bartlett and is currently the Davenport Visiting Professor at the Yale School of Architecture.  Awards  *In 2000, Elia Zenghelis received the Annie Spink Award for Excellence in Education from the Royal Institute of British Architects.  Quote  \\"From the early 60's architecture was entering a period of crisis and the search for a way forward shifting out of the profession and into the schools. (...) Through he Architectural Association I was sent to Ulm and with the support of the school we were able to invite new radical architects like Coop Himmelblau and Adolfo Natalini of Superstudio to London: providing not only cross- pollination but a system of support across borders. By the late 60s the Architectural Association had become a breeding ground for radical ideas and even before I met Rem Koolhaas as a student in 2nd year I had left my job and centred my life at the school.\\" (Zenghelis, \\"Statement of Intent\\", 2003)  Selected list of works by Gigantes Zenghelis Architects  *Lanapark Masterplan and residential buildings, Tirana, Albania, 2005. *Kinostudio, residential building, Tirana, Albania, 2005. *Extension to Designcenter \\"De Winkelhaak\\", Antwerp, Belgium, invited competition (First Prize), 2004. *Europol Headquarters, The Hague, The Netherlands; Invited Competition, 2004. *Hellenikon Metropolitan Park and Urban Development, Attika, Greece, competition, 2004. *Flemish Administration Centre in Leuven, Competition, First Prize, 2002. *Bolzano ModerneKunstmuseum, competition, Italy, 2001. *Venice Biennale Pavilion - Invited project for Biennale giardini, Venice, Italy, 2000. *World Intellectual Property Organization Competition, Geneva, Switzerland, 2nd Stage, Invited, 2000. *Stuttgart 21 Bibliothek, Stuttgart, Germany, 2nd Stage, 1999. *Waterfront of Thessaloniki, Invited International Competition, Thessaloniki, Greece, 1997. *Lleida (Lerida) University Library, Spain - Invited UIA Competition, Finalist, 1997. *Ashikita House of Youth, Kumamoto, on the island of Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan, 1996-1998. *1995 Moabiter Werder Parliamentary Housing - Invited Competition, 1995. *Maison de Retraite, Soci√©t√© d'Economie Mixte pour l'Equipement du Loiret, Paris - Invited Competition, 1993. *Spreeufer-Hauptbahnhof, Berlin - Invited Competition, 1992.

These customs are still active in many parts of Australia, to a greater or lesser extent. Avoidance relationships are a mark of respect. There are also strong protocols around avoiding, or averting, eye contact, as well as around speaking the name of the dead. Avoidance of members In general, across most language groups, the two most common avoidance relationships are: =Son/daughter-in-law and mother-in-law= In what is the strongest kinship avoidance rule, some Australian Aboriginal customs ban a person from talking directly to their mother-in-law or even seeing her. A mother-in-law also eats apart from her son-in-law or daughter-in-law and their spouse. If the two are present at the same ceremony, they will sit with their backs to each other but they can still communicate via the wife/husband, who remains the main conduit for communication in this relationship. Often there are language customs surrounding these relationships.Aspects of Traditional Aboriginal Australia AIJA Aboriginal Cultural Awareness Benchbook for Western Australian Courts This relationship extends to avoiding all women of the same skin group as the mother-in-law, and, for the mother-in-law, men of the same skin group as the son-in-law. The age of marriage is very different for men and women with girls usually marrying at puberty while a man may not marry until his late 20s or even later. As mothers-in-law and sons-in-law are likely to be of approximately the same age the avoidance practice possibly serves to circumvent potential illicit relationships. It has also been suggested that the custom developed to overcome a common cause of friction in families. =Brother‚Äìsister= This usually takes place after initiation. Prior to this, brothers and sisters play together freely. Both these avoidance relationships have their grounding in the Australian Aboriginal kinship system, and so are ways of avoiding incest in small bands of closely related people. There are many other avoidance relationships, including same-sex relationships, but these are the main two. =Sexual relationships= Once children are older, they are viewed as potential marital partners and their sexual behavior becomes one of strict avoidance until married. Permanent relationships are prescribed by traditional law and often arranged before birth. Same-sex relationships are viewed in the same light as incest or \\"wrong\\" marriages (i.e., to a partner of their own choice or wrong skin group) which carry the same penalties as a domestic crime against the community. However, intimate bodily contact between women regardless of marital status is not considered sexually suggestive but affirmation of friendship and a \\"right to touch\\". Touch is particularly important when women tell jokes or discuss matters of a sexual nature. In these circumstances behavior such as \\"nipple tweaking\\" and \\"groin grabbing\\" are seen as signs of friendship.\\"Transgressive sex: subversion and control in erotic encounters\\", Fertility, Reproduction and Sexuality, Vol. 13, Berghahn Books, 2009. pp. 214‚Äì216. Avoidance of naming the dead Traditionally, this meant avoiding referring to a deceased individual by name directly after their death as a mark of respect\\"Australian findings on Aboriginal cultural practices associated with clothing, hair, possessions and use of name of deceased persons\\", Pam McGrath and Emma Phillips, Research paper, International Journal of Nursing Practice, Vol. 14, Issue #1, pp. 57‚Äì66‚Äîand also because it is considered too painful for the grieving family. Today the practice continues in many communities, but has also come to encompass avoiding the publication or dissemination of photography or film footage of the deceased as well. Most forms of media include a disclaimer warning Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders that the program may contain images and voices of such people who have died (as recommended by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\\"ABC Indigenous Content\\"). The avoidance period may last anywhere from 12 months to several years. The person can still be referred to in a roundabout way, such as, \\"that old lady\\", or by their generic skin name, but not by first name. In some Central Australian communities, if for example, an individual named Alice dies, that name must be avoided in all contexts. This can even include the township Alice Springs being referred to in conversation in a roundabout way. Those of the same name as the deceased are referred to by a substitute name during the avoidance period such as Kuminjay, used in the Pintubi-Luritja dialect, Pintupi Luritja, a Western Desert language, http://www.clc.org.au/articles/info/aboriginal-languages/ or Galyardu, which appears in a mid-western Australia Wajarri dictionary for this purpose. This presents some challenges to indigenous people. In traditional society, people lived together in small bands of extended family, and name duplication was less common. Today, as people have moved into larger communities (with upwards of 300 to 600 people), the logistics of name avoidance have become increasingly difficult. Exotic and rare names have therefore become more common, particularly in Central Australia and desert communities, to deal with this new challenge.

Political entity The municipality is located in the west of the state, from the state capital of Morelia. It has a territory of , bordering the municipalities of Perib√°n, Tanc√≠taro, Apatzing√°n, Aguililla and Tepalcatepec, with the state of Jalisco to the west. The seat is Buenavista Tomatl√°n, with a population of about 8,500 people. This seat serves as the local government for the entire territory, with a municipal president, a syndic, and 7 representatives called regidors. Other principal communities include Carillo Puerto, Santa Ana Amatl√°n, Piz√°ndaro and 18 de Marzo. The main economic activities of the municipalities are farming and ranching. Geography and environment It has an average altitude of above sea level, being on the foothills of the Trans- Mexican Volcanic Belt and the valley formed by the Tepalcatepec River. Notable elevations include the hills called Zirapatiro, Del Azucar, Felipe Catlan, Los Osotes and Polon. This river accounts for most of the municipality's surface water, with the rest provided by springs and streams. The climate is tropical with temperatures that range between 18 and 36 degrees C. It is relatively dry, with rains in the summer. Annual average rainfall is 745.2mm. The ecosystem is dominated by tropical deciduous forest, with species such as pine and oak in the higher elevations along with kapok, parota, tepeguaje, mango and zapote (Diospyros digyna and Casimiroa edulis). There are also areas of tropical spiny brush. Typical fauna includes species such as cacomistle, skunks, squirrels, coyotes, foxes, Eurasian sparrowhawk, doves and other birds. History The name means \\"good view\\" in Spanish. Its original name was Tomatl√°n Buenavista, with the first name from Nahuatl meaning \\"place of tomatoes\\". The area was first formally settled by the Mexicas during the pre Hispanic period, but its population was mixed with those of the Purhepecha and Pirinda ethnicities. This community was located just north of the current municipal seat, which is now an archeological site at a ranch called Pueblo Viejo. After the Spanish Conquest, the location of the current town of Buenavista began as a hacienda. After Independence, it came under the control of the municipality of Apatzing√°n. The current municipality was formed in 1927, taking land from the municipalities of Apatzing√°n and Tanc√≠taro, with the seat named Buenavista Tomatl√°n.

Hiking is usually divided into day-hikes and multiple-day hikes, called backpacking, trekking, and walking tours. The equipment selected varies according to the duration, distance, planned activities, and the environment. Additional factors include weight and preparedness for unplanned events. The level of preparedness can relate to remoteness and potential hazards; for example, a short day hike across farmland or trekking in the Himalayas. The length and duration of a walk can influence the amount of weight carried. The nature of a hike is both by the natural environment and the applicable government regulations and hikers plan accordingly when considering equipment. To minimize the impact on the natural environment, many hikers follow the principles of \\"Leave No Trace\\".  Planning and checklists  Thomas Hiram Holding with some early camping gear ultralight multi-day backpack According to Tom Brown, the basic plan for survival is in the order of shelter (including clothing), water, fire, and food. Cody Lundin writes about the \\"Rule of 3s\\"; this relates to human survival without basics: three minutes without air, three hours without shelter, three days without water, or three weeks without food. stout knife example, this blade is by . Knife mounted on backpack strap Hikers may take with them equipment ranging from a stout knife to ultralight backpacking (10‚Äì25 pounds), to the heaviest, most durable gear a hiker can carry. Checklists help to minimize the chance of forgetting something important. Considerations for choice of hiking equipment may include: * Length and remoteness of trip * Optimal weight and capacity * Special medical considerations * Weather: temperature range, sun/shade, rain, snow, ice * Terrain: trail conditions, cliffs, sand, swamp, river crossings * Shelter and clothes * Water plan * Food * Overnight shelter * Protection from animals: insect repellent, anaphylactic medication, snakebite first-aid, antivenom, mace, bear spray, bear-resistant food storage container * Equipment for special activities Carrying methods and capacity A smaller knife that may be worn on a neck-lanyard A heavier multi-tool may be belt-carried. A pack's capacity to carry items is determined by: * Carrying methods on the body * Bag volume * Construction strength, design, materials, and construction quality Commonly-used carrying methods include: * A wristband, belt loop, a thin neck lanyard, and clothing pockets are among the smaller, lighter methods. * A small belt pouch (60 cu.in., 1 liter) that can attach to a belt * A bodypack or tactical vest (100‚Äì200 cu.in.) is a load-bearing vest, and may be as simple as a fishing vest. * A single-shoulder pack (500‚Äì800 cu.in., 8-14L) uses one shoulder strap, such as a haversack, messenger bag, or sling bag. * A waistpack can range in size from a belt pouch to a haversack (1-14L); in the larger sizes, shoulder straps maybe provided. Waistpacks may be carried over a shoulder. * Day packs (1,000‚Äì2,000 cu.in., 17-34L) are small to mid- sized backpacks that have two shoulder straps, smaller ones may not include a waist belt. * A harness system may include a small backpack, a waistpack, a vest, and several belt pouches. * Larger cargo backpacks (6,000 cu.in, 100+L) that have substantial, well-padded shoulder straps and a waist belt; some of these are designed to carry a couple hundred pounds. Some hikers divide their backpack into sections associated with specific needs, i.e. kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, etc., or by clothes, shelter, water, fire, and food. Military and law-enforcement personnel use a variety of modular and attachment systems, like duty belts, tactical vests, All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment, MOLLE, Improved Load Bearing Equipment, FILBE, and PLCE. Military surplus outlets are optional sources for backpacking equipment. Construction quality may be determined by design, manufacturer reputation, advertised purpose, and field testing. Customer reviews are often posted online. Heavy pack fabrics are made from 800‚Äì1000 denier nylon material. A large, heavy pack of weighs , and of water weighs . The best-made packs may carry up to twice their weight in water; less well-made packs may only carry half their weight in water. The British army bergen backpack, which has a capacity of carrying up to is made from 1000 denier nylon. Backpacks carrying more than usually have waist-belts to help with posture by transferring the weight to the hips. Some experts recommend keeping the equipment's total weight to less than 25% of the hiker's weight. Apparel Apparel, including clothing, jackets, shoes, hats, etc., provides insulation from heat, cold, water or fire. It shades the body and protects it from injury from thorns and insect bites. Basic outdoor clothing materials are goose down, wool, polyester, and polyolefin, which provide similar degrees of insulation when dry. Wool and polyesters perform reasonably well for most weather conditions and provide some insulation while wet. Cotton/linen wicks moisture, good for hot/humid weather. Cotton, linen and down lose insulation when wet unless they are treated to be water-resistant. Natural fabrics, such as cotton, linen and wool have higher burn temperatures, and they char instead of melting when exposed to flame. When a fabric melts onto skin it is difficult to remove, unlike a material that chars. Nomex is used for fire-resistant clothing. Wool is a good all-around fabric. Cotton and linen are best for hot weather and worst for cold, wet weather. Synthetics can be about the same as wool in the winter; many of them are fire hazards. Fabrics can be treated to help reduce their disadvantages. Down is the lightest thermal-insulating material and compresses the most. Synthetics are next best. Wool is heavier than down and synthetics, and does not compress well. Stuff sacks and compression sacks are used for carrying insulated clothing and sleeping bags. Layered clothing allows for fine tuning of body temperature. The inner-base layer should wick away moisture. The mid-layer is used for the appropriate insulation, and the outer- shell layer provides wind and rain protection. For long trips, having enough clothes to change into is helpful, while washing or drying others. An extra pair of socks can be used as mittens. Shorts for swimming and fording streams are also useful. Wet clothes do not insulate as well and can freeze while a hiker is wearing them. If a hiker falls into ice water, an immediate dry change of clothes from a dry bag can be lifesaving. Layered clothing helps regulate body temperature in varying weather conditions. Hiking gaiters Leather hiking boot (1982) Gloves provide protection from blisters, abrasions, cold and hot objects, and insects. General purpose gloves are a thin glove- liners‚Äîwool may be preferred around campfires‚Äîcombined with a pair of leather gloves. Glove liners often provide enough dexterity while not fully exposing the hands to freezing conditions. Shoes with traction reduce the chance of slipping, causing an injury or death. Shoes that support the ankle may also prevent injury. Well-constructed, breathable, waterproof hiking boots are general-purpose hiking shoes. Mountaineering boots provide more specialized protection. Trainers, sandals, or moccasins are useful for easy walks and may be taken on extended hikes as backup, and to wear when fording streams and in the evening around camp. Waterproof gaiters are used in cold or wet conditions to protect the lower pants and upper part of the shoes, and reduce the amount of water, snow, and debris from entering boots and soaking into other fabrics. Brush chaps or pants for thick brush or thorns, and snake chaps or gaiters help protect the legs from snake bites. =Hot-wet-weather clothing= Poncho shelter * Long-sleeved shirt and long pants provide sun and insect protection, and help to reduce abrasions when plowing through brush and when slipping and falling on rocks. * Sun hat * Bug jackets and head-nets provide insect protection and are especially useful if the insect repellent is either not effective or runs out. These are a couple items that hikers may use to minimize the use of insect repellent on their skin. * Rain clothing made from waterproof or water-resistant fabrics, and preferably breathable, like Gore- Tex: ** Raincoat ** Rain pants and/or rain skirt (useful in hotter climates) ** Rain poncho, uses: tarpaulin, ground cloth, backpack cover, hammock, stretcher ** Plastic bags made into a poncho and a rain skirt ** Gloves and socks. Latex (petroleum degrades them) or Nitrile gloves (medical grade is the top grade) ** Plastic bags put on over socks then inserted into shoes ** Jungle footwear: vented boots to drain water, the best wicking socks possible, sandals with good walking straps or jungle moccasins =Snow-ice-cold clothing= High-altitude hikers encounter freezing conditions, even in summer, and there are also permanent glaciers and snowfields. Walking crampons * Parka, insulated coat extending below the waist, are often hooded * Snow pants: insulated, water-wind-resistant * Long underwear * Balaclavas are versatile, because they can protect the head, neck and face from the cold. * Insulated face mask to provide a solid wind barrier for extreme cold that is beyond a balaclava. * Scarves are equally versatile and may be combined with knit hats for the same effect as a balaclava. * Gloves: insulated, breathable, and water-resistant. Mittens for the more extreme cold temperatures, but they offer less dexterity. Glove liners used with mittens provide more dexterity without fully exposing the hands to the elements. * Snow boots, mukluks, bunny boots Shelter Tunnel tent =Overnight shelter= Modular sleep system Hennessy tent hammock tent with tarp Tropical rainforest distribution An overnight shelter may be as simple as a wool blanket and tarp, or a complete sleep-system inside a double-walled, four-season tent. Sleeping layers may be layered the same way as clothing layers: inner, mid, and outer shell. Bedding options range from a pillow made from clothes to a sleep system comprising sleeping pad, sleeping bag, bivouac shelter, bag liner, and compression sack. Shelter structures can be constructed from a tarpaulin, ground sheet, rope, poles, or trees, with a mosquito net. Rain poncho may be used as a ground sheet, or used as an overhead tarp, or rigged as a hammock. Tent hammocks comes with a bug net and overhead tarp. A cave, bivouac shelter, or debris shelter can also be used. Jungle shelters are used in jungles and tropical rainforest, where rainfall, mud, invertebrates, and snakes are common. A Venezuelan or jungle hammock is well ventilated, with a bug net and a covering tarpaulin. A platform can be built off the ground or tied into a tree. Trekking poles can be used to construct a shelter; they can be used as poles for a tarpaulin. Some tents are designed to use trekking poles in place of carrying additional poles, a technique common in ultralight backpacking. =Continuous clothing-sleeping layers= The line can blur or shift between clothing, bedding, and structural shelter. A rain-poncho and its thermal liner (or a regular poncho) is an example of equipment that can be clothing, bedding, and structural shelter. Ultralight backpackers use typical cold- weather clothes to extend the temperature ranges of their sleepingbags. Then this reasoning can extend to packing a winter coat and snow pants with a bivy bag before adding a two-pound sleeping bag. Adding an insulated pair of socks or down booties would complete the insulation layer. Given an unexpected turn toward cold weather, bedding can be converted to mobile insulation, but if the pack already contains those items, then time and energy are saved. Basic equipment and abilities The most basic hiking equipment is a stout knife, a pot, cordage, a few ways to make a fire, and equipment to carry water and other gear. A bandana Inuit snow goggles function by reducing exposure to sunlight, not by reducing its intensity * Bandana, uses: a hat, dust mask, face scarf, water filter, first-aid, signal, etc.; larger versions like a shawl, sarong * Cutting, chopping, and sawing: knife, multi-tool, tomahawk, hatchet, axe, bucksaw, snow knife or snow saw * Container (see below) * Cordage (see below) * Digging: sharp stick, stout knife, trowel, ice axe, entrenching tool (folding shovel), compact shovel, snow shovel * Fire (see below) * Light: ** Flashlight (UK torch) or two, preferably hands-free (headband or headlamp), spare batteries and bulb. ** Candle from wax or tallow, or an oil lamp ** Fire and a wood torch * Medical: first-aid kit, medicines, medicinal plants, cloth, cordage, superglue, Nitrile gloves **Avoiding the need for medical treatment is preferable when possible by learning about nature, water treatment, food poisoning, poisonous plants and animals, and survival skills to avoid things like frostbite. * Sun protection: ** Clothing: long-sleeved shirt and pants, hat with a full brim or used with a bandana, thin gloves ** Sunglasses: year-round protection from blowing sand/snow, sharp objects, glare, and snow blindness. A band of cloth (bandana) or bark can be used to fashion a pair of emergency sunshades by cutting narrow slits in them. They are critical at high altitude. ** Sunscreen protects from some rays ** Lip balm * Information: Having information includes being aware of the surroundings and events that may be relevant to the hiker. This starts by being able to navigate. Another part is the weather, being able to read the weather, having gathered the latest and longer predictions before a hike, and possibly having a weather radio for updates. Being able to see further (binoculars) and record what is seen maybe additional equipment in this area. ** Navigate by reference, terrain, global positioning system (GPS), and by map and compass. * Swimming goes with the first Rule of 3: air. If a hiker is swept off his or her feet into deep water, or falls into a lake, then swimming moves to the top of the list. * Trekking poles or hiking sticks are important for stability and balance. The key features of trekking poles that are important are weight, adjustability, shock absorption, locking mechanisms. =Water kit= Water needs to be drinkable. Hikers usually carry some, but do not carry all that they need, because it weighs one kilogram (2.2 lbs) per liter, and hikers can consume 2-4+ liters per day (4‚Äì9 lbs). Additional water usually can be located, collected, filtered, and purified. All water in the wild is potentially unclean. The details of locating water are beyond the scope of this article. The basics are using a map, knowing how water flows through and collects in certain geographical formations (natural cisterns), and identifying which plants indicate shallow-underground water and contain easily accessed water. Heading downhill to streams, and looking for rich, green vegetation that may indicate a spring, are ways to start. Following bees and tracking animals to cisterns, knowing where to dig in apparent dry stream beds, and possibly waiting for night when vegetation releases water, are slightly more advanced techniques. Water can be collected in a clean container. Clear plastic bags can be used to make vegetation and solar stills. Dehydrated, chemical-free sponges can be used to wipe dew from vegetation, or tied to ankles before one walks through damp vegetation in the morning, soaking up water from wet rocks or sand. A flexible drinking straw can access water in a rock crack, or drink from a water still without opening it. Tarpaulins can also be used to collect rain water or dew. Metal water bottles To remove larger impurities, water can be filtered through grass, sand, charcoal or cloth, such as a bandana or pantyhose. Pantyhose can also be used as an emergency fishing net. Filtering water of larger impurities is a useful way to extend the life of commercial filters, preventing them from getting clogged quickly. Water must be purified of harmful living organisms and chemicals. Some commercial filters can remove most organisms and some harmful chemicals, but they are not 100% effective. Distillation filters, purifies, and removes some harmful chemicals. Chemicals with a lower or about equal boiling point of water are not eliminated by distilling. Iodine or chlorine dioxide solutions or tablets can be used to purify water. It can be boil water in a fire-resistant pot or water bottle. Water can be boiled in some flammable materials like bark because the water absorbs the heat. Pasteurization takes place at temperatures lower than boiling point, but knowing the temperature of the water and calculating the duration of treatment can be difficult. This technique is useful when only non-durable containers are available. Sunlight can be used with a clear container. Filters made from heat-treated diatomaceous earth can also be used. Hydration reservoir =Transporting water= A wide-mouth, metal water bottle or a metal pot or cup can also be used to boil and transport water, and can be used fairly easily for cooking. A lid for the pot will help water to boil sooner, helps with cooking by requiring less fuel, and reduces water loss. Other containers for transporting water include appropriate plastic water bottles in materials like Nalgene. There are hard plastic bottles, and soft-collapsible bottles. A hydration pack tube freezes easily. A non-lubricated condom can hold up to two liters, but is very vulnerable to puncture. Placing a stick in the knot will allow it to be re-used. Breast milk bags are plastic bags that double-Ziploc, so they are easier to reseal than a condom and they do not puncture as easily. They are transparent, allowing solar purification and can be used as a magnifying lens to start a fire. Containers that may freeze with water in them may allow for 10% expansion; they may be filled to 90%. Oral rehydration therapy packets can be added to water to help replace electrolytes. =Fire kit= Fire needs ignition, oxygen, and fuel, and the ability to be extinguish. Ignition can come from a spark, a chemical reaction, electricity, or concentrated solar energy. The more oxygen involved, the easier the fire starts and the hotter it burns. Organic material must either be dry or the fire must be hot enough to dry it and burn it. Fraying organic material is more combustible as a tinder. Grain dust and granulated sugar can ignite when oxygenated over a flame. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Disposable butane lighter  Permanent match and lanyard  A storm-proof piezo-ignited Silva  Dakota fire pit } Diagram of a bow drill designed for fire starting Heat convection in a hobo stove A campfire Sources of ignition include flint, carbon steel, firesteel and a sharp edge, matches, butane and Zippo, and peanut lighters, and magnifying glasses. Fuels include natural substances like dry wood, peat and coal. pitch, petroleum jelly, charred cotton, shaved rubber, and frayed synthetic cloth can be used as kindling. Candles provide illumination and can help start a fire. Alcohol, DIY and commercial alcohol stoves are made and carried by hikers. Oil, petroleum, vegetable, and tallow can help start and feed a fire. Propane bottles are made for backpacking. Charcoal or briquettes could be packed in the fire. Sure fire is a way to start a fire in bad conditions or when a hiker has no man-made equipment, like when the fuel is wet, or the lighter has run out of fuel. Some hikers will carry tinder in a few forms, such as a few cotton balls soaked in pure petroleum jelly, fat wood (pitch). Alcohol-wipes and alcohol-hand-sanitizers are other options. Vegetable oils, and some fruit oils, like olive oil, coconut oil, corn chips, or nuts are edible and can be used to help start a fire because of the oil in them. \\"Bad\\" conditions also includes high altitude because of less oxygen, high winds blowing out a fire, high humidity that soaks either the fuel source or the igniter. To extinguish a campfire, see extinguishing a campfire. Knowing ways to survive a wildfire may also be helpful. =Cordage= MIL-SPEC MIL-C-5040 Type III Paracord has seven to nine inner yarns made up of three strands each. Cordage provides the abilities to bind, build, repair, and prevent damage. It comes in many sizes and materials, and can be used for building shelters and traps, flossing teeth, fishing, repairing and making clothes, replacing shoelaces, gluing or taping things together. Many cordages are made from natural materials. Some types of cordage are: * Parachute cord is flexible; its inner threads can be easily pulled out to make longer cordage, or used as threads for sewing or fishing. * Sewing and suturing thread, dental floss, fishing line, bank line, string, twine, clothes line. * Wire, such as tripwire or snare wire, has many uses. * Lanyards, straps, belts, bungee cords * Tape: medical tape, duct tape, gaffer tape * Elastic/rubber bands (slingshotslingshot), condomscondoms for a slingshot * Climbing rope for shelters, cliffs, and scrambling * Superglue =Containers= A Ziploc-branded zipper storage bag There are a variety of containers for organizing and keeping equipment dry: * Clear, plastic Ziploc freezer bags in quart and gallon sizes can be used for emergency water purification and transportation. When filled with equipment and clothes, they become inflated and may help with emergency flotation. * Dry bags are heavier, more durable, and provide the same benefits. A dry-bag can be used as an emergency container for boiling water using the hot-rock method. * Stuff sacks and compression sacks help reduce the volume of clothes and sleeping bags. * Hard-sided, plastic containers that seal using an O-ring may be used to carry critical or expensive equipment, such as electronics, and for the kit that holds the main pocket items.  Food  Trail mix made from peanuts, raisins, and candy coated chocolate, around 4.8 kcal/gram Military ready meals provide a wide range of food options for hikers; they tend to be higher in fat and salt than is appropriate for sedentary people. The meals are not dehydrated, and are not intended for more than a few days of hiking. Most of them are not designed to minimize the space they take in a pack. In addition to a food's expiration date, the main considerations for hiking food are water content, caloric density (more energy per pound for a given space), and nutritional density (more nutrition per pound for a given space). Water weighs , so a food container can weigh up to less when it contains dehydrated food. Dehydrating foods can reduce weight and may reduce nutrition while increasing the need for water to reconstitute the food. More weight also expends more energy, so packing lighter foods reduces the need for more calories. Calories equate to energy. Nutrition becomes more important as the number of hiking days increases; for example MREs are not intended to be used beyond ten days. Multi-vitamins may help offset some nutrition deficiencies. The three macronutrients are fats (lipids), carbohydrates (sugars and starches), and protein. Fats are calorie dense and nutritionally important, nuts are a good example. Carbohydrates (starches and sugars) that release energy slowly (as measure by glycemic index and glycemic load or the insulin index) give sustained energy, such as legumes and whole grains. Some sources of protein are meats, dairy products, fish, eggs, whole grains, pulses, legumes, and nuts. These are the reasons that \\"trail\\" mix usually has dried fruit and a variety of nuts. Nuts and dried fruit can last a long time based on their expiration date. The USDA's page on expiration dates is available online. Not all food needs to be dehydrated or dried. When a hiker plans to carry a couple liters of water, that is 4.4 pounds of water weight that can be carried in fresh fruits and vegetables for the first day. The same is true for other foods based on their water-weight. Depending on which ones are chosen, this can eliminate or reduce the need for cooking, and the reconstitution time. One of the first meals on a hike could be a Greek salad with a fruit cocktail, followed later with refried beans and tortillas. Nut-butter and honey sandwiches on flatbread can last longer depending on the preservatives in the bread and nut-butter. The same is true for canned goods, most of the weight is in the water. Selecting a canned food is the same: calorie and nutritional dense. Using this can put a hiker down the trail a day or two with little difference in the foods normally eaten. Taking foods that do not require cooking provides for higher mobility (not stopping to cook), and allows for the contingencies of not having a fire, the cook stove breaking, or running out of fuel. In general, the foods in a grocery store that are not in the refrigerated-freezer sections, are available for the trail. No-bake home-made \\"energy\\" protein bars may contain oatmeal, ground flaxseed, arrowroot powder (medicinal uses), peanut butter, powdered nuts, chopped nuts, coconut oil (multi-use), coconut flakes, dried fruit, cinnamon (medicinal), cooked beans, and natural sweeteners, like honey; they may also be baked. Baked versions may contain natural sweeteners like bananas, applesauce, grated carrots and zucchini. Either way, they and the no-bake ingredients may be used for the trail. Flavor enhancers: salt, salt substitute, powdered peppers, spices, dried herbs, powdered bullion or cubes, hot sauce. If food supplies run out, a field guide to edible, medicinal, and poisonous plants may be useful. Or a hiker could study them ahead of time. As the movie \\"Into the Wild\\" brought out, some poisonous plants look like edible plants. He had a field guide with him but did not notice the details well enough. Vegan note: The equipment in this article comes from hoping for the best and preparing for the worst, balanced with how much a hiker wants to carry and is willing to risk. Within that context, if the worse scenario happens and starvation is imminent, then it may be too late to choose and learn and be able to fish and trap. As neutrally stated, the decision becomes an informed choice. If hikers plan their food carefully, they may wind up eating more healthily on the trail. Refrigeration Water and food can be cooled in snow. Evaporation causes cooling and is used in the pot-in-pot refrigerator. Placing green grass or a sponge into a hat and soaking it with water is another technique. Bottled water can be cooled in a stream. =Cooking= A small portable stove running on gas and the stove's white carrying case Ultralight backpackers rely only on food that does not need cooking, and reconstitute dehydrated, pre-cooked food without cooking it. A hot drink or meal may help someone with a lower body temperature or help boost morale. In an emergency, most locations would supply material for a fire, as long as there was a container that could withstand the heat. Some options and tradeoffs for choosing equipment. Cooking options Cooking options may range from a candle to a bonfire, and may include a solar oven, or a Fresnel lens, or more typical tools and other options: * Alcohol stove * Beverage can stove * Billycan * Campfire ** Cooking in tinfoil pockets ** Cooking with green-sticks ** Steaming food in appropriate green leaves ** Using a metal grill ** Using thin rocks as a skillet * Cook stove * Hobo stove * Portable stove * Rocket stove * Shichirin Common utensils: knife, fork, spoon, and spork. A butter knife may not be an optimal weight item considering that other knives may be available, or at least it may be sharpened. Utensils may be carved from wood. A fork spears food, so can a sharp stick or a knife. Sporks trade off the volume of the spoon with the ability to spear food. A mid-sized, sturdy metal spoon may be used for cooking, eating, and digging. Even if not cooking, utensils can be useful as tools. * Mess kit or cookset is a nested set, usually containing a pot with a lid, some times the lid doubles is a frying pan or plate, a bowl, and possibly a cup. * Towel, bandana, or cotton T-shirt * Biodegradable soap, or natural cleansers like baking soda, vinegar, pure lemon crystals Personal hygiene Equipment not already in the kitchen. * Dental hygiene: toothbrush (may be sharpened for a marlin spike for rope work), etc. * Feminine hygiene that doubles as first-aid and tinder: tampons, pads * Toilet paper (tinder), wet wipes (sure fire) * Tweezers, in a kit, in a multi-tool, on a keyring Electronics A modern Project 25-capable professional walkie-talkie Handheld-waterproof electronics (or stored in waterproof bags) with spare batteries for critical gear. Some devices come with different power options: solar, hand-crank, and/or USB. And then there are portable solar-charging systems. Depending on electronics to work in life- and-death situations means that the hiker's life is at risk when the equipment fails. * AM-news-weather radio * Camera, extra film/memory card * Cell phone * Personal-locator beacon or other emergency locator beacon, especially important in possible avalanche areas * Emergency-channel scanner * Flashlight, a red filter saves night vision, but reduces sight distance and signalling; carry a spare bulb. * Global Positioning System (GPS), a lightweight yet rugged and waterproof model with a long battery life, memory for topographical maps, base map ability (so a hiker can drive to the trail) plus the ability to store notes. These are not to be used as a primary navigation tool (as some of their instructions read), but when a hiker can only see a few feet, a GPS can help. If conditions are that bad, then recreational hikers may use it to head toward shelter, versus using it to get into worse conditions, farther from help, and risk having it fail. * Laser pointer for signaling but can cause eye damage * Strobe light * VHF radio: emergency airband-aircraft communication, amateur/ham radio, FM radio (news), marine-band radio for talking to ships * Walkie talkie or citizens band radio * UV water purifier: purifies water using laser-UV light, may double as a flashlight Impenetrable jungle in a rainforest, Cameroon Modern snowshoes Snowshoes with rawhide webbing Ice climbing with an iceaxe, crampons, and rope-climbing gear  Additional equipment  * Binoculars, monocular * Deep snow: trekking poles with baskets or ski poles, snowshoes, cross-country skies, snow shovel, snow saw * Ice: Traction cleats with anti-slip soles, crampons, caulk (cork) boots * Jungle: machete, hammock, extra tinder and insect repellent * Notepad and writing implements for leaving notes, making notes, drawing, journaling * Rain-proof cover for backpack * Sewing kit: scissors can be in the multi-tool, a place to store the threaded needles, dental floss and fishing line may double as thread, Kevlar thread, safety pins for repair and fishing hooks, replacements for critical buttons or fasteners. * Umbrella: useful for hiking in the rain or sunshine,; it may be used to help build a small structure * Walking stability and uphill effort: a walking stick or two, trekking poles, ski poles * Waterproofing supplies * Water bottle parka to either delay freezing or when wet, provide cooling * Wild food when legal or appropriate: field-guide to plants, trapping-hunting kit: traps, scent lures, hunting weapon, slingshot.

It tells the story of a ninja's pupil that controlled the wind. It was based on the manga by Sanpei Shirato and was animated by Yasuji Mori and Hayao Miyazaki. The anime was renamed \\"Kaze no Fujimaru\\" in order to associate it with its sponsor, Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals. The opening theme, 'Sh≈çnen Ninja Kaze no Fujimaru' and the closing theme, 'Tatakau Sh≈çnen Ninja', were both performed by the Nishirokugo Boy's Choir (Ë•øÂÖ≠ÈÉ∑Â∞ëÂπ¥ÂêàÂî±Âõ£; Nishirokug≈ç Sh≈çnen Gassh≈çdan). The series originally ended with a repeat of the opening; the separate ending song came later.  Plot summary  The story begins when Fujimaru is a little baby. His mother puts him in a basket while she works in the country. Suddenly, the baby is kidnapped by an eagle, but Sasuke, a samurai, recovers the baby and takes him as a disciple. Fujimaru grows until he becomes a gifted young man who can control the wind by learning ninjutsu. He knows two strong techniques: 'multiplication' (which allows him to confuse his enemies by creating illusions of himself) and 'leaves' (which helps him to run away behind a wind swirl). Fujimaru has two goals: to see his mother again and to find the 'Ryuen Book', a handwritten parchment that contains great but dangerous techniques. Fujimaru's main enemy is Japusai, a master of fire techniques who is also searching for the parchment. In the end, Fujimaru attains both goals: he runs into his mother and finds the parchment, but he decides to destroy it because it would be too dangerous in Japusai's hands.

A familiar application of a dilatometer is the mercury-in-glass thermometer, in which the change in volume of the liquid column is read from a graduated scale. Because mercury has a fairly constant rate of expansion over ambient temperature ranges, the volume changes are directly related to temperature. Applications Dilatometers have been used in the fabrication of metallic alloys, study of martensite transformation, compressed and sintered refractory compounds, glasses, ceramic products, composite materials, and plastics.Hans Lehmann, refuge Gatzke Dilatometry and differential thermal analysis for the evaluation of processes ? ? , 1956. Dilatometry is also used to monitor the progress of chemical reactions, particularly those displaying a substantial molar volume change (e.g., polymerisation). A specific example is the rate of phase changes. In food science, dilatometers are used to measure the solid fat index of food oils and butter. Another common application of a dilatometer is the measurement of thermal expansion. Thermal expansivity is an important engineering parameter, and is defined as: \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{V} \\\\biggl(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T} \\\\biggr)_{p,N}\\\\ Types There are a number of dilatometer types: * Capacitance dilatometers possess a parallel plate capacitor with a one stationary plate, and one moveable plate. When the sample length changes, it moves the moveable plate, which changes the gap between the plates. The capacitance is inversely proportional to the gap. Changes in length of 10 picometres can be detected.J. J. Neumeier, R. K. Bollinger, G. E. Timmins, C. R. Lane, R. D. Krogstad, and J. Macaluso, \\"Capacitive-based dilatometer cell constructed of fused quartz for measuring the thermal expansion of solids\\", Review of Scientific Instruments 79, 033903 (2008). * Connecting rod (push rod) dilatometer, the sample which can be examined is in the furnace. A connecting rod transfers the thermal expansion to a strain gauge, which measures the shift. Since the measuring system (connecting rod) is exposed to the same temperature as the sample and thereby likewise expands, one obtains a relative value, which must be converted afterwards. Matched low-expansion materials and differential constructions can be used to minimize the influence of connecting rod expansion Theta Industries http://www.theta-us.com/dil/dil1.html http://www.usinenouvelle.com/industry/netzsch-geratebau-gmbh-8585/horizontal- pushrod-dilatometer-dil-pc-p72147.html * High Resolution - Laser Dilatometer Highest resolution and absolute accuracy is possible with a Michelson Interferometer type Laser Dilatometer. Resolution goes up to picometres. On top the principle of interference measurement give the possibility for much higher accuracies and it is an absolute measurement technique with no need of calibration.C.Linseis The next step in dilatometry, invention and use of the Linseis Laser Dilatometer , Linseis Messgeraete GmbH, Selb (Germany) * Optical dilatometer is an instrument that measures dimension variations of a specimen heated at temperatures that generally range from 25 to 1400 ¬∞C. The optical dilatometer allows the monitoring of materials‚Äô expansions and contractions by using a non-contact method: optical group connected to a digital camera captures the images of the expanding/contracting specimen as function of the temperature with a resolution of about ¬±70 micrometre per pixel.M.Paganelli The Non-contact Optical dilatometer designed for the behaviour of Ceramic Raw Materials , Expert System Solutions S.r.l., Modena (Italy). As the system allows to heat up the material and measures its longitudinal/vertical movements without any contact between instrument and specimen, it is possible to analyse the most ductile materials, such as the polymers, as well as the most fragile, such as the incoherent ceramic powders for sintering process. For simpler measurements in a temperature range from 0 to 100 ¬∞C, where water is heated up and flow or over the sample. If linear coefficients of expansion of a metal is to be measured, hot water will run through a pipe made from the metal. The pipe warms up to the temperature of the water and the relative expansion can be determined as a function of the water temperature. For the measurement of the volumetric expansion of liquids one takes a large glass container filled with water. In an expansion tank (glass container with an accurate volume scale) with the sample liquid. If one heats the water up, the sample liquid expands and the volume changes is read. However the expansion of the sample container must also be taken into consideration. The expansion and retraction coefficient of gases cannot be measured using dilatometer, since the pressure plays a role here. For such measurements a gas thermometer is more suitable. Dilatometers often include a mechanism for controlling temperature. This may be a furnace for measurements at elevated temperatures (temperatures to 2000 ¬∞C), or a cryostat for measurements at temperatures below room temperature. Metallurgical applications often involve sophisticated temperature controls capable of applying precise temperature-time profiles for heating and quenching the sample.

Life  Franz Leydig was born on 21 May 1821 in Rothenburg ob der Tauber (on the Tauber river).\\"Franz von Leydig - Wikipedia\\" (German), German Wikipedia, 2006-10-29, de.wikipedia.org webpage: GermanWP-Franz_von_Leydig. He was the only boy of three children born to Melchior Leydig, a Catholic and a minor public official, and Margareta, a Protestant. Leydig shared both his father's Catholic religion and hobbies: his father was a keen gardener and beekeeper. Leydig himself recalled later that those childhood interests began his lifelong concern with botany and zoology. At age 12, he acquired a simple microscope, which he used in the majority of his free time. Leydig studied philosophy in Munich from 1840, and medicine at the University of W√ºrzburg from 1842 under Martin M√ºnz (1785‚Äì1848), August Schenk, and Franz von Rinecker (1811‚Äì1883). He received his doctorate in medicine at W√ºrzburg on 27 August 1847, becoming an assistant in the physiology department, while also teaching histology and developmental anatomy under Albert von K√∂lliker (1817‚Äì1905). In 1848 he became prosector at the zootomic institution in W√ºrzburg in 1848. The following year he qualified as a lecturer, and on 9 May 1855 he was appointed professor. In the winter of 1850‚Äì1851, Leydig made a journey to Sardinia, where he became aware of the rich marine life that was to become the subject of some of his most important researches. That journey, coupled with his early preoccupation with microscopy, directed the course of his life's work. In 1857 Leydig became full professor of Zoology and Comparative anatomy at the University of T√ºbingen, and he published his Lehrbuch der Histologie des Menschen und der Tiere: his main contribution to morphology. In the Lehrbuch, Leydig reviewed the crucial developments in the history of histology, including the discovery and definition of the cell by Jan Evangelista Purkyne (1797‚Äì1869), Gabriel Gustav Valentin (1810‚Äì1883), and by Theodor Ambrose Hubert Schwann (1810‚Äì1882), who described the cell as a vesicle containing a nucleus in 1839. Leydig paid further tribute to other contemporary anatomists, particularly Johannes Peter M√ºller (1801‚Äì1858) for his work on glands and emphasizing cellular doctrine for pathology. Leydig's book was published at the time of similar subjects ‚Äì most notably K√∂lliker's Handbuch der Gewebelehre des Menschen (1852) and Joseph von Gerlach‚Äôs (1820‚Äì1896) Handbuch der allgemeinen und speciellen Gewebelehre des menschlichen K√∂rpers... (1848). The Lehrbuch, however, gives the best account of the growth of comparative microscopical anatomy in the two decades following Schwann‚Äôs discoveries. He became professor of comparative anatomy at the University of Bonn in 1875, where he also became director of the anatomical institute, as well as, director of the zoological museum and the zoological institute. He was later made Geheimer Medizinalrat and on 1 April 1887, professor emeritus. He died on 13 April 1908 in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, his birthplace. His wife, Katharina Jaeger, the daughter of a professor of surgery at Erlangen, who survived him; they had no children. During his lifetime, Franz Leydig was granted many honours, including personal ennoblement, and an honorary doctorate of science from the University of Bologna. He was a member of several medical and scientific societies, including the Royal Society of London, the New York Academy of Sciences, the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1898).  Impact  Franz von Leydig's work on neural tissue influenced Norwegian zoologist and polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen (1861‚Äì1931), who along with Wilhelm His, Sr. (1831‚Äì1904) and Auguste-Henri Forel (1848‚Äì1931), were the first to establish the anatomical entity of the nerve cell. Chief among Leydig's discoveries is the interstitial cell (\\"Leydig cells\\"), a body enclosed in a smooth endoplasmic reticulum and holding lipid granules and crystals, which occur adjacent to the seminiferous tubules of the testes. The cells produce the male hormone testosterone. Leydig had described the interstitial cells in his detailed account of the male sex organs.\\"Zur Anatomie der m√§nnlichen Geschlechtsorgane und Analdr√ºsen der S√§ugetiere,\\" Z. Wiss. Zool. 1850;2:1‚Äì57 The above description clearly indicates that Leydig recognized the specific morphology of those cells: only recently, have their endocrine nature and ultrastructure been fully understood. In addition to its historical importance, Leydig‚Äôs \\"Lehrbuch\\" is significant for his description of a large secretory cell, found in the epidermis of fishes and larvae amphibians. This mucous cell is unusual in that it does not pour secretion over the surface of the epithelium; Leydig believed that the cell function was to lubricate the skin, and the cell now bears his name. Leydig is also known for describing large vesicular cells that occur in the connective tissue and the walls of blood vessels in crustaceans in 1883: four different types of the latter have been determined.

Microatoll growth is predominantly lateral, as vertical growth is limited by a lack of accommodation space. Small colony of Porites porites Porites is a genus of stony coral; they are small polyp stony (SPS) corals. They are characterised by a finger-like morphology. Members of this genus have widely spaced calices, a well-developed wall reticulum and are bilaterally symmetrical. Porites, particularly Porites lutea, often form microatolls. Corals of the genus Porites also often serve as hosts for Christmas tree worms (Spirobranchus giganteus). Aquarium trade Specimens of Porites are sometimes available for purchase in the aquarium trade. Due to the strict water quality, lighting and dietary requirements, keeping Porites in captivity is very difficult. Most Porites that are collected have Christmas tree worms (Spirobranchus giganteus) that bore into the coral, serving as additional aesthetic livestock. These particular Porites specimens are called \\"christmas tree worm rocks\\" or \\"christmas tree worm coral\\". Paleoclimatology Porites corals have been shown to be accurate and precise recorders of past marine surface conditions. Measurements of the oxygen isotopic composition of the aragonitic skeleton of coral specimens indicate the sea-surface temperature conditions and the oxygen isotopic composition of the seawater at the time of growth. The oxygen isotopic composition of seawater can indicate the precipitation/evaporation balance because oxygen atoms of the more abundant mass 16 will preferentially evaporate before the more rare mass 18 oxygen. The relationship between temperature, precipitation, and the oxygen isotopic composition of Porites corals is important for reconstructing past climates, and associated large- scale patterns such as the El-Nino Southern Oscillation, the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the mean state of the climate system. Ecology and biogeography Corals in the genus Porites are found in reefs throughout the world. It is a dominant taxon on the Pandora platform of the Great Barrier Reef. Potts et al. (1985) identified 7 dominant species: P. lobata, P. solida, P. lutea, P. australiensis, P. mayeri, P. murrayensis, and P. anae. The oldest of six colonies in this reef was approximately 700 years old, and was estimated to be growing at 10.3 mm per year. Meyer and Schultz (1985) demonstrated that P. furcata has a mutualistic relationship with the schools of French and white grunts (Haemulon flavolineatum and H. plumierii) that rest in their heads during the day. The fish provide it with ammonium, nitrates, and phosphorus compounds. Coral heads with resting grunts experience significantly higher growth rates and nitrogen composition than those without. Representatives of this genus are found in both the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean basins. Physiology Some species in this genus demonstrate high levels of halotolerance. In the Gulf of Thailand P. lutea tolerates daily tidal shifts of 10-30‚Ä∞ salinity. Moberg et al. (1997) determined that when the salinity declines, the symbiotic zooxanthellae decrease their photosynthesis rate as the coral contracts its polyps to protect them. The corals maintain their metabolic rate by temporarily switching to heterotrophy, consuming prey such as brine shrimp and other zooplankton. Porites growth rates can be determined by examining annual rings in their skeleton. This method was used to determine that P. astreoides grows its skeleton about the central axis by approximately 3.67mm/year, calcifies at approximately 0.55g/cm¬≤/year, and increases density in this region of the body at approximately 1.69g/cm¬≥/year. Additionally, Meyer and Schultz (1985) reported that coral growth varies seasonally. They observed that P. furcata's growth rate peaked between May and August, which is summertime in their Caribbean habitat. Threats Threats to corals in the genus Porites include predation, climate change, and anthropogenic pollution. When exposed to increased temperatures and copper, P. cylindrica slowed its rate of production. Additionally, the symbiotic zooxanthellae reduced their photosynthesis rate when exposed to both stressors. Done and Potts (1992) observed that when settled, larvae in Porites are vulnerable to competition from other corals and predation from sea urchins. Additionally, mortality likelihood increases following strong storms.

PETE plastic egg carton for 24 eggs An egg carton (also known as an egg box in British English) is a carton designed for carrying and transporting whole eggs. Description These cartons have a dimpled form in which each dimple accommodates an individual egg and isolates that egg from eggs in adjacent dimples. This structure helps protect eggs against stresses exerted during transportation and storage by absorbing a lot of shock and limiting the incidents of fracture to the fragile egg shells. An egg carton can be made of various materials, including foamed plastics such as polystyrene foam, clear plastic or may be manufactured from recycled paper and molded pulp by means of a mechanized papier-m√¢ch√© process. Origins Before its invention, eggs were carried in egg baskets. In 1906, Thomas Peter Bethell of Liverpool invented a predecessor to the modern egg box and marketed it as the Raylite Egg Box. He created frames of interlocking strips of cardboard, and packed these frames in cardboard or wooden boxes for transport by road or rail. In 1911, newspaper editor Joseph Coyle of Smithers, British Columbia invented the egg carton, to solve a dispute between a local farmer and hotel owner in Aldermere, near present-day Telkwa, in British Columbia, over the farmer's eggs' often being delivered broken. In 1921, Morris Koppelman patented an improved version of the egg carton made from cut, folded and glued cardboard and functions similar to todays egg cartons. The patent emphasized the ability for it to fold flat after use, which is a feature no longer considered important. In 1931, Francis H Sherman patented an egg carton formed with pressed paper pulp that is recognizable as the modern egg carton used today. In 1969, the United Industrial Syndicate (UIS) in Maine (a division of The Portland Company) patented an egg carton appears similar to Sherman's pressed paper pulp carton but has special pedestals formed into the carton to provide support for the weight of stacks of egg cartons and other strength related features and also an improved clasping closure feature. The three inventors listed on the filing are Walter H. Howarth, Gerald A. Snow, and Harold A. Doughty. Unlike many products, trademarks and advertisements for egg brands are usually printed on the food container itself rather than on a separate container (as with breakfast cereals). This single-layer, distinctive packaging distinguishes among egg cartons from different producers or levels of quality on the retail shelf. Sizes Standard egg cartons have room for 10 or 12 eggs, but they can come in a variety of sizes, holding from three to 24 eggs. Trays are usually used to store fresh eggs from farms or at farmers' markets. Plastic egg trays are also used by egg processors to wash and sanitize eggs. A cardboard sleeve or additional trays are used to protect eggs when using a tray format.  References  External links Brodrene Hartmann‚Äôs Egg Carton Production Facility, Missouri.

Criticisms in the form of poems or witticisms were posted on well-known statues in Rome, as an early instance of bulletin board. It began in the 16th century and continues to the present day. In addition to Pasquino and Marforio, the talking statues include: Madama Lucrezia, Abbot Luigi, Il Babuino, and Il Facchino. History Marforio at the Musei Capitolini The first talking statue was that of Pasquino, a damaged piece of sculpture on a small piazza. In modern times the weathered fragment has been identified as representing the mythical king of Sparta, Menelaus, husband of Helen of Troy, and a major character in the Iliad, holding the body of Patroclus. In 1501, the statue was found during road construction and set up in the piazza; soon after small poems or epigrams critical of religious and civil authorities began to be posted on it. One story of the origin of the statue's name, and of its witticisms, is that it was named to honor a local resident named Pasquino. A tailor by trade (in some versions of the story he is a barber or schoolmaster), this man's career took him into the Vatican, where he would learn behind-the-scenes gossip. He would then spread this gossip, with acerbic commentary, for the entertainment of friends and neighbors. Upon his death, the statue was named in his honor, and people began posting commentary similar to Pasquino's on the statue. The statue seems to have been a local institution; it was also dressed up as a pagan god on the feast day of Saint Mark. Some sources suggest that the first postings were little more than schoolboys taunting their teachers, but the statues quickly became a major outlet for critiquing government and religious leaders. Pasquino became so famous that his name was turned into an English word, pasquinade, which means a satirical protest in poetry. A number of popes, who were often the butt of criticism from the statues, sought to limit the posting of commentary on Pasquino. Adrian VI planned to have it thrown into the Tiber River, and was only dissuaded when told that, like a frog, the statue would only croak louder in water. Another potentially apocryphal story has a reward being offered to the anonymous writers if they came forward. According to the tale, one man responded, and his hands were cut off. Eventually, the authorities settled for posting guards by the statue to prevent the posting of more commentary. As a result, the public turned to other statues, who joined Pasquino as talking statues. These other statues included Marforio, which was sometimes used to post responses to writings posted on Pasquino, creating a repartee between the two statues.

Popular in the 1970s, his biggest hit is \\"Rock 'N' Roll (I Gave You the Best Years of My Life)\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart in 1973 (as well as reaching the UK Top 40). He also had a top 20 hit with \\"Bonnie Please Don't Go\\" (aka \\"She's Leavin'\\") in 1971. \\"Rock and Roll\\" is one of the most covered songs written by an Australian with 27 different artists recording it in 1975 alone. Covers include fellow Australians, Col Joye and Dig Richards, and international artists, Mac Davis, Terry Jacks, Gary Glitter, Joe Dassin (in French), The Cats and Tom Jones. Davis' rendition became the highest charting version on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 15 in 1975.  Early life  Kevin Stephen Johnson was born on and grew up in Tungamull, which is between the Capricorn Coast and Rockhampton, Queensland. He is the only son of Richard Johnson (timber contractor) and Elinor Johnson (post office, telephone exchange operator). Elinor was also a violinist and gave Johnson lessons but he showed little interest. He bought a guitar in his late teens and began his music career by singing in local beer gardens, then joining the Candymen on lead vocals and rhythm guitar. From the early 1960s he worked for the Queensland Department of Roads as a clerk; playing and singing at night and writing songs in his spare time. Some of his songs came to the notice of rock and roll artist, Col Joye, who signed Johnson to his publishing company. In September 1966 Col Joye and the Joy Boys had a hit with \\"Mary Anne\\", which had been written by Johnson. In 1967 Johnson relocated to Sydney and recorded his first single, \\"Hayman Island\\" on Joye's ATA label in January. He followed with \\"Woman You Took My Life\\" in April 1968 but neither single had any chart success. Aside from his music career Johnson also worked for the Registrar-General's Department of New South Wales. \\"Woman You Took My Life\\" was later recorded by Tom Jones, and by Vince Hill. In 1969 Johnson signed with independent label, Sweet Peach. His debut album, In the Quiet Corners of My Mind, appeared in that year. It was recorded at the Adelaide Studios of Gamba with Jimmy Stewart as producer and Lewandowski as engineer. In February 1971 he issued his first hit single, \\"Bonnie Please Don't Go\\" aka \\"She's Leavin'\\", which peaked at No. 12 in Melbourne, No. 2 in Sydney, and No. 15 on the Go-Set National Top 60. It remained on the Go-Set charts for a total of 25 weeks; it was listed at No. 22 on their end of year chart; and No. 7 for Top Australian Singles of the year.  \\"Rock and Roll\\"  Kevin Johnson changed labels to the United States-based Tree International, owners of Dial Records, and for two years he wrote songs for other artists while vainly attempting to record his own material. He later recalled \\"Because I'd signed with an American company I couldn't record here ... two years writing and bashing my head against a brick wall\\". In September 1973 he issued \\"Rock and Roll I Gave You the Best Years of My Life\\". It peaked at No. 10 in Melbourne, and at No. 4 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. The lyrics describe a musician recalling his childhood dream of being a star and follows his life through his musical work, with some close breaks until he is faced with the ultimate realisation that he is not destined to become a star. It ends on an upbeat note from the would-be celebrity proclaiming \\"I thank the lord for giving me the little that I knew\\". Johnson based the early verses on his own life and the later verses \\"on others I've known. I always draw on things I know, things around me, on everyday life for my songs\\". He told Australasian Performing Right Association representative, Debbie Kruger, in March 2002, that he had written it in two days: He had become dissatisfied with his US record label, Dial Records, in Nashville, Tennessee and told them he was about to leave. However he was informed that other artists had already recorded his song, so he quickly recorded and released his own version on the Australian-based Good Thyme label through Festival. Kruger noted that \\"[the song] reflected his frustration with his own stagnation, and the futile attempts of Australian artists trying to break into America or England\\". In the US Johnson's single was issued on Mainstream Records, it went to No. 73 on the Billboard singles chart in 1973. It was picked up by producer Jonathan King and released in the United Kingdom on his UK Records label in 1974 when it reached No. 23 on the UK Singles Chart the following year. The song reached number 8 in the Irish charts on its original release in 1974, returning to number 18 under the UK Records release in January 1975. According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, it is one of the most covered songs written by an Australian with 27 different artists recording it in 1975 alone. Covers include fellow Australians, Col Joye and Digby Richards, and international artists, Mac Davis, Terry Jacks, Gary Glitter, Joe Dassin (in French), The Cats and Tom Jones. Some cover artists, including Davis, leave out the lyric \\"... I'd never be a star\\" for a happier ending. Johnson believes \\"There were a few people who wouldn't sing [that line] because in their minds they were big stars\\". Others, like Glitter, leave out the upbeat ending in the Johnson version for a more sombre ending. Jacks' version went to No. 97 in the US in 1974 ‚Äì it reached No. 22 in Canada ‚Äì and Davis' rendition became the highest US charting version, reaching No. 15 in 1975. In 1996 Johnson re-wrote the track for the Australian Football League (AFL) as their official Centenary Song, retitled \\"Aussie Rules I Thank You for the Best Years of Our Lives\\". It was used as an introductory theme before AFL games during that season. During the late 1990s it was used as the closing theme for Foster's Aussie Rules, a US highlights show.  Later life  In February 1974 Kevin Johnson issued his second solo album, Rock and Roll I Gave You the Best Years of My Life, on the Good Thyme label. In the next year he supported an Australian tour by Roberta Flack. He released a succession of singles on the label and followed in August 1976 with a third album, Man of the 20th Century. For that album he used session musicians including Russell Dunlop on drums; Wayne Findlay on keyboards; Jim Kelly, Kirk Lorange, Mark Punch, and Rory O'Donoghue on guitars; and Tim Partridge on bass guitar. Later that year he toured Europe and appeared on a TV special broadcast into France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland. His single, \\"Grab the Money and Run\\", appeared on the Irish charts. Johnson toured Europe again in 1977. He also signed with Festival Records' offshoot Infinity to issue further singles and an album, Journeys, which appeared in 1978. Additional albums followed including Best of Kevin Johnson (a compilation album, 1979), Night Rider (1981), Spirit of the Times (1985), Now and Then (compilation, 1992) and The Sun will Shine Again (September 1996). JAM Kevin Johnson formed a trio, JAM (initialism for Johnson Ashdown McClellan) with Doug Ashdown (\\"Winter in America\\" aka \\"Leave Love Enough Alone\\") and Mike McClellan (\\"Song and Dance Man\\"). They toured Australia through the 2000s.  Personal life  In 1967 Kevin Johnson married Jill and by April 1975 the couple had two children.

It is located beside the lake of the same name. While the town's population is small, it services a large agricultural district in the northern Wickepin Shire. At the , Yealering had a population of 104. History Yealering's name is of Aboriginal origin and was first recorded in 1870 for the lake next to the town. It was first settled in the 1870s as a grazing lease and was later the site of a market garden. Yealering Lake was a valuable source of fresh water for the settlers. Community picnics and sporting days, for which the town became renowned, were held on the banks of the lake, and in dry years horse races were run on the lake bed. From 19 April 1944 to 29 September 1945 during World War II, Yealering had a prisoner of war camp which began with 100 Italian POWs, and when it closed there were 125 POWs. The W15 POW Control Centre was run by Lt W Baker from 19 April 1944 to 12 October 1944 In 1907, land around Yealering was opened up for selection, and in 1908, the Yealering Lake Progress Association was formed. After the Government's announcement of a railway from Wickepin to Merredin, a townsite was surveyed and in 1912 the town was gazetted, and already by that stage included a primary school, post office and several other buildings. A hall made from local bricks was added in 1927. Present day Yealering is an agricultural service town with a primary school, a recently refurbished hall, a general store and a hotel, as well as other businesses and services. The nearby lake has several recreational options including water skiing, an 18-hole golf course and a caravan park. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops.

The episode originally aired in Canada on February 5, 2007 on The Movie Network, and subsequently aired March 14 on Sky One in the United Kingdom, and June 22 on the United States Sci Fi Channel. It was written by executive producer Martin Gero, and directed by Martin Wood. The episode is the first of a three-parter, in which the new Earth ship Apollo arrives at Atlantis to conduct a preemptive strike against the Asurans before they can launch a fleet to attack Earth. \\"First Strike\\" was a beginning to a new direction for the series. It aired alongside \\"Unending\\", the series finale of Stargate SG-1. At the time it was considered the best episode the producers had done, and featured one of the longest visual effects sequences in the series. The episode earned Stargate Atlantis the strongest ratings since the mid-season hiatus, and was generally well received.  Plot  The newest Earth warship, Apollo, arrives at Atlantis. Its commander, Abe Ellis (Michael Beach), informs the Expedition that recon missions have discovered the Asurans building ships on their homeworld, which the IOA believe will be used to attack Earth. As the ships are built from only conventional materials, Apollo has been assigned to destroy them in a preemptive strike, using the new \\"Horizon\\" weapons delivery system. Apollo successfully carries out the mission over the objections of Weir (Torri Higginson), who feels her authority being increasingly sidelined. Soon after Apollo returns to Atlantis, the Asurans retaliate by launching a Stargate satellite that fires an energy beam, disabling the Apollo before zeroing in on Atlantis. The beam will deplete the city's shield in just under 30 hours, and with the satellite and its active Stargate over the city, the Expedition cannot evacuate using their own Stargate. McKay (David Hewlett) and Zelenka (David Nykl) submerge the city to mitigate the effect of the beam, but this only buys them nine more hours before the city is destroyed. Realizing that the only way to save Atlantis is to move the city out of the satellite's range, McKay and Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) decide to use their one Zero Point Module and the geothermal power station found in \\"Submersion\\" to power the stardrive. Lorne (Kavan Smith) and a squadron of F-302s are sent to temporarily block the beam using a large moon fragment, so that shield power can be redirected into the stardrive. However, the beam resumes as the city lifts off, briefly grazing the central tower before the shield can be restored. Weir is severely injured and is taken to the infirmary by Beckett's replacement, Jennifer Keller (Jewel Staite). Atlantis jumps into hyperspace, but the stardrive unexpectedly shuts down well before they reach their destination. McKay realizes that they are marooned in deep space, with only 24 hours before the shield runs out of power and the city's occupants are exposed to space.  Production  = Writing and casting = The script for \\"First Strike\\". \\"First Strike\\" first surfaced on September 2006. It was conceived after the completion of the mid-season two-parter, \\"The Return\\", where writer Martin Gero wanted Atlantis leave the planet, but didn't know how and why it would happen until the episode was written. Gero also wanted Atlantis damaged and drop out of hyperspace into deep space by the end, so the following episode \\"Adrift\\" would follow. The Stargate satellite was originally meant to be a moon-sized satellite sent to destroy Lantea, but was dropped in favour for the Stargate satellite to destroy Atlantis, since a previous episode \\"Echoes\\" involved the saving of Lantea, and Brad Wright deemed its proposed destruction inappropriate. The scene where Weir thought her leadership challenged was needed to be written, since there were several instances in past episodes where the military step in as leaders. The scene where Ronon Dex says he needs to learn more science was written to parallel Ronon's appearance in only a few scenes. Gero also wrote the Fantastic Four into the scene, where Sheppard compared Teyla Emmagan to the Invisible Woman, paralleling the lack of Teyla's appearance as well. Jewel Staite was cast as Keller because the producers loved her performance as Ellia in season two's \\"Instinct\\". \\"First Strike\\" introduced Jewel Staite as Jennifer Keller. Staite was originally cast because the producers loved her appearance as Ellia, a Wraith adolescent in season two episode \\"Instinct\\". Gero created the character to not take over Carson Beckett, but to fill in for him, and thought it endearing to have Keller uncomfortable in her new position. She was originally meant to be a Canadian character, but because fellow executive producer Paul Mullie thought there were already enough Canadian characters, she was turned into an American instead. The third season saw less of Mitch Pileggi as Colonel Caldwell, commander of the Daedalus, due to other commitments (including Day Break). The writers didn't want to kill him off, so they chose to introduce a new character instead, which was where the Apollo was introduced, as well as Abe Ellis, the ship's commander. Gero added a list of actors that would be suitable to play him. When Michael Beach was suggested, the crew decided to go with him. However, Beach wasn't familiar with the Stargate franchise, and was compelled to join the series by his mother, who was a fan. David Ogden Stiers again guest starred as Oberoth. Stiers actually drove from Los Angeles to Vancouver, though he was only wanted for one scene. A retired Colonel of the United States Air Force and his wife made cameo appearances. = Filming = The episode was filmed during the end of September/ beginning of October, 2006. One of the first scenes, where Keller talks to Weir was done on one long take. In the middle of the scene, the two entered an Atlantis transporter to another floor. The scene was filmed on the same floor, and during the time on the transporter, around 40 people quickly redecorated the hallway. The first scene Michael Beach appeared in was the conference at the beginning of the episode. Despite his lack of knowledge to the series, Beach still acted the scene in one take, where the writers were convinced at his acting style. Beach also asked several questions about the direction and characteristics of his character. Martin Wood noted that he asked \\"all the right questions.\\" The scene showing McKay and Zelenka below the horizon was filmed from above by Brad Wright's request, though Gero and Wood wanted the scene shot horizontally. The one scene featuring Stiers as Oberoth was the conversation between him and Weir, which was filmed on the same large room, only Stiers and Torri Higginson had their back to each other around five to ten feet apart. Three camera angles were used during Lorne's scene in the F-302. To save costs, one of the camera angles was operated by Kavan Smith himself, who held it on his lap. Elsewhere, the producers wanted to make the control chair rotate as Sheppard flies the city to make it different than any other actions involving the control chair. A stunt towards the end of the episode was used where Weir gets thrown after the beam grazes the tower. The stunt was not originally approved by the producers. A stuntwoman doubled Higginson as Weir during the sequence. The scene was rehearsed several times before filming the actual sequence. During the actual sequence, the stuntwoman wore a plastic mask to prevent the flying glass from injuring her face. = Visual effects = The episode's visual effects were produced by Rainmaker Digital Effects. Gero wrote the scene involving the minute long sequence where the Horizon weapon fires from the Apollo to the Asuran homeworld. He made contact with Mark Savela to see if it could be done; Savela was up to the challenge. The sequence was costly, since the visual effects team had to make a 3D world that would last a minute long to ensure that the sequence followed Gero's script. The sequences where Atlantis takes off from the bottom of the ocean were stock footage from \\"Rising\\", with the shield and beam added on. Another reason to keep the scenes was because the writers liked the scene to be reused. Another visual effect was used to switch Keller's flag patch from Canadian to American, since the decision to have Keller an American character was made after filming.  Reception  Joe Flanigan hinted that the episode would start a new direction for the series. \\"First Strike\\" earned a household rating of 1.5, representing just below 2 million viewers; 1.1 million from the 25-54 demographic, and 986,000 from the 18-49 demographic. It was the strongest rating for the series since the 1.6 rating from \\"The Return, Part 1\\". This placed Stargate Atlantis the Sci Fi Channel's second most viewed series, losing only to Stargate SG-1's final episode \\"Unending\\", which achieved a household rating of 1.7, representing 2.2 million viewers; and was placed fifth for Cable television for the day it aired. \\"First Strike\\" was also given a syndication rating of 0.6. It also received a fan rating of 9.29 out of 10, and a GateWorld rating of 3 out of 4 stars. The episode was considered the biggest the producers have done for series at the time. According to Joe Flanigan (John Sheppard), the episode would start a new direction for Atlantis. Jason Van Horn of IGN rated the episode an \\"impressive\\" 8.2 out of a possible 10, where the episode was praised for its visual effects and tension after the cliffhanger, which he thought would make the wait for its conclusion in the fourth season \\"even harder to handle,\\" though surprised to see Beckett's replacement, Jennifer Keller introduced in this episode, which in Horn's thought would please the fans of Firefly. Critical Myth rated the episode 9 out of 10. It was noted for Weir's struggle to maintain her leadership, which was covered earlier in the series since the introduction of Colonel Caldwell, though the topic should have been covered earlier in the season. Ian Calcutt of HDTV UK noted the although the episode had many parallels with the SG-1 finale, \\"First Strike\\" made a \\"cracking\\" finale for the third season of Stargate Atlantis. Brett Love of TV Squad considered the episode a classic season finale, and liked the introductions of Keller and Ellis to the storyline, as well as stating the return of the Asurans as a welcoming one. Brigit Cherry of Total Sci-Fi rated the episode 9/10, commented that though the premise seems simple, the plot was fast-moving and efficient, and appreciated the episode's visual effects, stating that Atlantis is an \\"exceptionally strong Stargate brand in its own right.\\"  References   External links  * First Strike at mgm.com First Strike on scifi.com * Category:Stargate Atlantis episodes Category:2007 American television episodes ","title":"First Strike (Stargate Atlantis)"},{"id":"7676838","text":"Juli√°n Esteban (born 16 September 1986) is a retired Swiss-Spanish footballer.

He was a descendant of Louis Jolliet. Early years He was born Barth√©lemy Jolliet in the parish of Saint-Thomas at Montmagny in 1789, a descendant of the explorer Louis Jolliet. After his father's death, his mother remarried and he grew up in L'Assomption. He articled as a notary with his uncle, Joseph-√âdouard Faribault, was qualified to practice in 1810 and set up practice in L'Assomption. Career and marriage Joliette served as a captain in the local militia during the War of 1812. In 1813, he married Charlotte Lanaudi√®re, daughter of Charles-Gaspard Tarieu de Lanaudi√®re and received as dowry part of the seigneury of Lavaltrie. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Leinster in March 1820; however, parliament was dissolved shortly afterwards and he did not run in the election that followed later that year. After his mother-in-law died in 1822, Joliette took on much of the running of the family seigneuries. He had a sawmill built to convert the pine forests into lumber for export to Great Britain. Joliette also established a new village, Industrie, that was later to become Joliette. He was named justice of the peace in 1826 and promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the militia the following year. In 1830, he was elected to the legislative assembly for the newly formed riding of L'Assomption, formerly part of Leinster but only served until 1832, when he was appointed to the Legislative Council. In the meantime, he had expanded his lumber operations, although it was necessary to go further afield in such of timber. Joliette also built a distillery at Industrie and built a railroad to link it to Lanoraie. He also built a church and the Coll√®ge de Joliette, run by the Clerics of St Viator. He remained loyal to the government during the Lower Canada Rebellion and served on the Special Council that administered the province afterwards. He appears to have been opposed to the union of Upper and Lower Canada. He was named to the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada in 1841, but attempted to organize support for a motion contesting the legality of the union. Death He died in Industrie in 1850. Legacy Besides the town of Joliette, rue Joliette and Joliette metro station in Montreal were named for him.

Elgar was first attracted to the Chronicles after finding mention of them in Walter Scott's Old Mortality.Kennedy CD note History Froissart was composed in 1890 to the commission of the Worcester Festival, for a secular concert during that year's Three Choirs Festival, and was Elgar's first large-scale work for full orchestra. Ironically, ambitious Elgar, who moved to London for his career, got major contract from his hometown. The work was finished by July, and it was first performed in Worcester, conducted by the composer, on 9 September 1890. It was performed three days later in Birmingham by William Stockley's Orchestra, for whom the composer had played violin since 1882, but it would be ten years before the work was performed in London. Structure Allegro moderato, 4/4, B-flat major The work consists of a single movement, lasting a little under a quarter of an hour. The motto written by Elgar on the manuscript score is a quotation from an 1817 poem by Keats: 'When Chivalry lifted up her lance on high.' The opening is a graphically chivalric flourish, but commentators have found the subsequent working out of the themes too long and discursive. \\\\relative c' { \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 \\\\tempo \\"Allegro moderato.\\" r2 r4 bes16-._\\\\markup { \\\\dynamic ff \\\\italic brillante } bes-. a-. bes-. d2\\\\< ^\\\\markup \\\\italic ten. f8-.\\\\\\\\! d16-> bes-> f d bes f g8\\\\<[ r16 bes] bes8[ r16 \\\\\\\\!] 4-! g16-.\\\\downbow g-. fis-. g-. es'2\\\\< ^\\\\markup \\\\italic ten. g8-!\\\\\\\\! es16-> c-> g es c g } Nevertheless, although an obviously early work, it contains some touches of the mature Elgar. W.

Froissart is not a programmatic work: unlike the later Falstaff or even Cockaigne it does not tell a detailed story; it evokes a mood and manner in broad terms. Recordings The work has been recorded many times. Elgar himself recorded it with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1933 for HMV. This recording was reissued on CD in 2007.

From 2012 to 2016, he was the principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union. Personal life Soghoian is the nephew of Sal Soghoian, the former Automation Product Manager at Apple Inc., responsible for AppleScript and Automator. Education Soghoian, who holds British and US nationality,Brown, David. FBI foils student's air scam site The Times November 3, 2006 received a B.S. from James Madison University (Computer Science; 2002), a Masters from Johns Hopkins University (Security Informatics; 2005), and a PhD from Indiana University (Informatics; 2012). His dissertation focused on the role that third-party internet and telecommunications service providers play in facilitating law enforcement surveillance of their customers. Soghoian is a Visiting Fellow at Yale Law School's Information Society Project and a TED Senior Fellow. He was previously an Open Society Foundations Fellow and a Student Fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. Government surveillance research and activism Soghoian's research and advocacy is largely focused on government surveillance. His research has shed significant light on the use of sophisticated surveillance technologies by US law enforcement agencies, exposing such techniques to public debate and criticism. In an August, 2013 presentation at the hacker conference DEF CON, Soghoian highlighted the existence of a dedicated FBI team that delivers malware to the computers and mobile devices of surveillance targets. In his presentation, Soghoian stated that he discovered the team by reading heavily redacted government documents and by looking at the profiles of ex-FBI contractors on the social network website LinkedIn. In October, 2014, Soghoian called attention to the fact that the FBI had, in 2007, impersonated the Associated Press in an effort to deliver malware to a teenager in Washington state who had threatened to bomb his high school. This act of deception was strongly condemned by leading news organizations, including by the General Counsel of the Associated Press. In a February, 2012, public speech, Soghoian criticized the commercial market for so called zero-day security vulnerabilities, a topic which, until then, had yet to receive significant attention from the mainstream press. One month later, Soghoian was quoted by Forbes, in a lengthy article about the zero day market, describing the firms and individuals who sell software exploits as ‚Äúthe modern-day merchants of death‚Äù selling ‚Äúthe bullets of cyberwar.‚Äù Over the next several years, several major media outlets published their own front- page stories on the industry, often with quotes from Soghoian criticizing those providing such hacking software to governments. In December 2009, while an employee of the Federal Trade Commission, Soghoian secretly audio recorded a closed-door surveillance industry conference. The agency's inspector general opened an investigation into Soghoian's conduct, and he was subsequently let go from the FTC. In the recording, an executive from Sprint Nextel revealed that the company had created a special website through which law enforcement agents can obtain GPS information on subscribers and that the website had been used to process 8 million requests during the previous year. That recording was subsequently cited by Alex Kozinski, Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in U.S. v. Pineda-Moreno, in support of his view that \\"1984 may have come a bit later than predicted, but it's here at last.\\" Encryption activism In June 2009, Soghoian co-authored an open letter to Google with 37 prominent security and privacy experts, urging the company to protect the privacy of its customers by enabling HTTPS encryption by default for Gmail and its other cloud based services. In January 2010, Google enabled HTTPS by default for users of Gmail, and subsequently for other products, including search. According to Google, it was already considering HTTPS by default.https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/us/googleblogs/pdfs/google_httpsresponse.pdf Soghoian has in recent years continued his HTTPS advocacy, calling on news media, law firms, government agencies and other organizations to encrypt their own websites. Consumer privacy research and activism In May 2011, Soghoian was approached by public relations firm Burson-Marsteller and asked to write an anti-Google op-ed, criticizing the company for privacy issues associated with its social search product. Soghoian refused, and instead published the email conversation. A subsequent investigation by journalists revealed that the PR firm, which had refused to identify its client to Soghoian, had been retained by Facebook. In May 2011, Soghoian filed a complaint with the FTC, in which he claimed that online backup service Dropbox was deceiving its customers about the security of its services. Soon after Soghoian first publicly voiced his concerns, Dropbox updated its terms of service and privacy policy to make it clear that the company does not in fact encrypt user data with a key only known to the user, and that the company can disclose users' private data if forced to by law enforcement agencies. In October 2010, Soghoian filed a complaint with the FTC, in which he claimed that Google was intentionally leaking search queries to the sites that users visited after they clicked on a link from the search results page. Two weeks later, a law firm filed a class action lawsuit against Google for this practice. The lawsuit extensively quoted from Soghoian's FTC complaint. In October 2011, Google stopped leaking search queries to the sites that users visited, and then in 2015, the company settled the search query leakage class action lawsuit for 8.5 million dollars. Between 2009 and 2010, he worked for the US Federal Trade Commission as the first ever in-house technical advisor to the Division of Privacy and Identity Protection. While at the FTC, he assisted with investigations of Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and Netflix. Boarding pass security Soghoian first gained public attention in 2006 as the creator of a website that generated fake airline boarding passes. On October 26, 2006, Soghoian created a website that allowed visitors to generate fake boarding passes for Northwest Airlines. While users could change the boarding document to have any name, flight number or city that they wished, the generator defaulted to creating a document for Osama Bin Laden. Soghoian claimed that his motivation for the website was to focus national attention on the ease with which a passenger could evade the no-fly lists. Information describing the security vulnerabilities associated with boarding pass modification had been widely publicized by others before, including Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) and security expert Bruce Schneier. On October 27, 2006, then- Congressman Edward Markey called for Soghoian's arrest. At 2 am on October 28, 2006, his home was raided by agents of the FBI to seize computers and other materials. Soghoian's Internet Service Provider voluntarily shut down the website, after it received a letter from the FBI claiming that the site posed a national security threat. On October 29, 2006, Congressman Markey issued a revised statement stating that Soghoian should not go to jail, and that instead, the Department of Homeland Security should \\"put him to work\\" to fix the boarding pass security flaws. The FBI closed its criminal investigation in November 2006 without filing any charges, as did the TSA in June 2007.

The town is located 823 kilometres south west of the state capital, Sydney and 303 kilometres north west of Melbourne. Situated on the banks of the Murray River across from Koondrook in the neighbouring state of Victoria, Barham had a population of 1,159 at the . The town is in the Murray River Council local government area. History For thousands of years before white explorers arrived, the Barapa Barapa people camped, hunted fished and gardened here. Their cooking mounds, scar trees, middens and artefacts can readily be found on private land and throughout the forests. Each nomadic clan had their own territory with exclusive rights to the camping, fishing and hunting. There was some vigorous resistance to the first settlers, but the indigenous population dramatically decreased in the late 1800s, mainly due to disease. The history of white settlement begins in 1843 when the 114,656 acre 'Barham' station was taken up by Edward Green, who named it after the maiden name of his wife.T.R.McConnell, History of Barham (1951) The south bank of the Murray was then settled towards the end of the Victorian gold rush where squatters grazed sheep & cattle. The typical Australian struggle between squatters (on vast acreage) and selectors (who took up small lots) was played out throughout the district, with selectors such as Parkman, McConnell and Hudson moving in to take up small farms within the Barham station lease from 1877. The Post Office opened on 1 January 1895. Growth was slow until 1904 with the construction of a lift span bridge designed to allow paddle steamers through.  Heritage listings  Barham has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 319 Main Road: Barham Bridge over Murray River Also of historic and architectural interest in Barham are the Royal Hotel (1904) and the National Bank building (1912).  Timber industry  From the early 1870s, timber cutters began to set up camps and log the River Red Gums (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) that grow in the surrounding forests. Koondrook, on the Victorian side, developed more quickly than Barham, soon becoming the centre of a large forest industry with the timber being used to build boats & paddle steamers. Some of these boats are still operating, the paddle steamer Melbourne, built at Koondrook in 1914 is a tourist attraction at Mildura, the Alexander Arbuthnot, built in 1923, & the Emmylou built in 1980-1982 operate in Echuca. The timber industry has continued to supply building timber, garden timber and firewood with several sawmills operating in the area. The Bonum Sawmill, occupying land at the Northern edge of Barham, incorporated several significant value-adding enterprises, such as a kiln, veneering and finger-jointing before closing in 2010 when the New South Wales government closed access to many of the forest areas following many years of drought and poor tree growth.  Barham Bridge  Barham's development was aided when a lift span bridge across the river opened in 1904, designed by Ernest de Burgh of the Department of Public Works and constructed by Monash & Anderson, with John Monash in charge. The bridge replaced a punt that was used to ferry people, stock and goods across the river, and allowed road access between the Riverina and the Victorian markets, while permitting the passage of paddle steamers when the middle section was raised. Until it was motorised in 1997 it was operated by a system of weights worked by two men turning wheels. The span is still occasionally raised. The bridge is now one of the oldest remaining across the Murray River. A similar bridge was constructed upstream at the same time between Cobram, Victoria and Barooga, New South Wales.  Agriculture  The region boasts a rich agriculture based on irrigation including rice, sheep, citrus, cereal crops, dairy, walnuts, olives, and beef cattle. The town today The major industries in and around Barham are agriculture, including dairying and citrus, and forestry. Like much of the southern Riverina, the town is attuned culturally to Victoria, reading Victorian newspapers and watching Victorian television channels. The most popular team sport is Australian rules football, the town in conjunction with neighbouring township Koondrook across the Murray having an Australian Rules football team competing in the Central Murray Football League. Golfers play at the Barham Golf and Country Club on Moulamein Road. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 1,159 people in Barham. 83.5% of people were born in Australia and 89.9% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were Anglican 28.6%, No Religion 24.4% and Catholic 18.1%. Notable people Barham is the birthplace of Australian cyclist Michael Rogers and Danny Lolicato Victorian Young Engineer of the year 2017.

They describe a correspondence between the complex representations of a reductive algebraic group G over a local field F, and representations of the Langlands group of F into the L-group of G. This correspondence is not a bijection in general. The conjectures can be thought of as a generalization of local class field theory from abelian Galois groups to non-abelian Galois groups. Local Langlands conjectures for GL1 The local Langlands conjectures for GL1(K) follow from (and are essentially equivalent to) local class field theory. More precisely the Artin map gives an isomorphism from the group GL1(K)= K* to the abelianization of the Weil group. In particular irreducible smooth representations of GL1(K) are 1-dimensional as the group is abelian, so can be identified with homomorphisms of the Weil group to GL1(C). This gives the Langlands correspondence between homomorphisms of the Weil group to GL1(C) and irreducible smooth representations of GL1(K). Representations of the Weil group Representations of the Weil group do not quite correspond to irreducible smooth representations of general linear groups. To get a bijection, one has to slightly modify the notion of a representation of the Weil group, to something called a Weil‚ÄìDeligne representation. This consists of a representation of the Weil group on a vector space V together with a nilpotent endomorphism N of V such that wNw‚àí1=wN, or equivalently a representation of the Weil‚ÄìDeligne group. In addition the representation of the Weil group should have an open kernel, and should be (Frobenius) semisimple. For every Frobenius semisimple complex n-dimensional Weil‚ÄìDeligne representations œÅ of the Weil group of F there is an L-function L(s,œÅ) and a local Œµ-factor Œµ(s,œÅ,œà) (depending on a character œà of F). Representations of GLn(F) The representations of GLn(F) appearing in the local Langlands correspondence are smooth irreducible complex representations. *\\"Smooth\\" means that every vector is fixed by some open subgroup. *\\"Irreducible\\" means that the representation is nonzero and has no subrepresentations other than 0 and itself. Smooth irreducible representations are automatically admissible. The Bernstein‚ÄìZelevinsky classification reduces the classification of irreducible smooth representations to cuspidal representations. For every irreducible admissible complex representation œÄ there is an L-function L(s,œÄ) and a local Œµ-factor Œµ(s,œÄ,œà) (depending on a character œà of F). More generally, if there are two irreducible admissible representations œÄ and œÄ' of general linear groups there are local Rankin‚ÄìSelberg convolution L-functions L(s,œÄ√óœÄ') and Œµ-factors Œµ(s,œÄ√óœÄ',œà). described the irreducible admissible representations of general linear groups over local fields. Local Langlands conjectures for GL2 The local Langlands conjecture for GL2 of a local field says that there is a (unique) bijection œÄ from 2-dimensional semisimple Deligne representations of the Weil group to irreducible smooth representations of GL2(F) that preserves L-functions, Œµ-factors, and commutes with twisting by characters of F*. verified the local Langlands conjectures for GL2 in the case when the residue field does not have characteristic 2. In this case the representations of the Weil group are all of cyclic or dihedral type. classified the smooth irreducible representations of GL2(F) when F has odd residue characteristic (see also ), and claimed incorrectly that the classification for even residue characteristic differs only insignifictanly from the odd residue characteristic case. pointed out that when the residue field has characteristic 2, there are some extra exceptional 2-dimensional representations of the Weil group whose image in PGL2(C) is of tetrahedral or octahedral type. (For global Langlands conjectures, 2-dimensional representations can also be of icosahedral type, but this cannot happen in the local case as the Galois groups are solvable.) proved the local Langlands conjectures for the general linear group GL2(K) over the 2-adic numbers, and over local fields containing a cube root of unity. proved the local Langlands conjectures for the general linear group GL2(K) over all local fields. and gave expositions of the proof. Local Langlands conjectures for GLn The local Langlands conjectures for general linear groups state that there are unique bijections œÄ ‚Üî œÅœÄ from equivalence classes of irreducible admissible representations œÄ of GLn(F) to equivalence classes of continuous Frobenius semisimple complex n-dimensional Weil‚ÄìDeligne representations œÅœÄ of the Weil group of F, that preserve L-functions and Œµ-factors of pairs of representations, and coincide with the Artin map for 1-dimensional representations. In other words, *L(s,œÅœÄ‚äóœÅœÄ') = L(s,œÄ√óœÄ') *Œµ(s,œÅœÄ‚äóœÅœÄ',œà) = Œµ(s,œÄ√óœÄ',œà) proved the local Langlands conjectures for the general linear group GLn(K) for positive characteristic local fields K. gave an exposition of their work. proved the local Langlands conjectures for the general linear group GLn(K) for characteristic 0 local fields K. gave another proof. and gave expositions of their work. Local Langlands conjectures for other groups and discuss the Langlands conjectures for more general groups. The Langlands conjectures for arbitrary reductive groups G are more complicated to state than the ones for general linear groups, and it is unclear what the best way of stating them should be. Roughly speaking, admissible representations of a reductive group are grouped into disjoint finite sets called L-packets, which should correspond to some classes of homomorphisms, called L-parameters, from the local Langlands group to the L-group of G. Some earlier versions used the Weil‚àíDeligne group or the Weil group instead of the local Langlands group, which gives a slightly weaker form of the conjecture. proved the Langlands conjectures for groups over the archimedean local fields R and C by giving the Langlands classification of their irreducible admissible representations (up to infinitesimal equivalence), or, equivalently, of their irreducible (\\\\mathfrak{g},K)-modules. proved the local Langlands conjectures for the symplectic similitude group GSp(4) and used that in to deduce it for the symplectic group Sp(4).

It is situated in a park-like setting complemented by of walking trails and a lake nature preserve. Approximately 13,000 residents live in Russett, which is divided into 21 residential neighborhoods, including four condominium communities, 11 town homes, and six single-family home neighborhoods. Three apartment rental properties on four sites pay assessments to Russett, as do several on-site commercial properties, including a Walmart and Sam's Club. The community is built out to a capacity of 3,600 units. Organization The Russett Community Association, Inc. (RCA) is the homeowners' association (HOA), and all homeowners are members. Annual HOA fees paid by homeowners fund an annual $2.5 million budget, which goes toward maintenance of playgrounds; a tot lot; tennis, basketball and beach volleyball courts; four pools and a pool house; walking trails; a community center; and private security. The county opened a police substation near the community in 2006. Except for condominiums, which have their own board of directors, each neighborhood has a committee with up to three members (elected at the annual RCA meeting). These three elect a chairperson who serves as the voting member. Representatives from all neighborhoods meet monthly and advise on community issues, with voting members deciding on changes to community documents, special fee assessments, and membership in the Board of Directors. Geography Russett is bordered by the Little Patuxent River and Oxbow Lake Nature Preserve, which attracts waterfowl and other birds. Part of Russett's land holdings is an undisturbed parcel under the control of the Anne Arundel County Board of Education. Government services Within Russett is a $4.3 million library operated by Anne Arundel County Public Library. Completed in 1998, The Maryland City at Russett Branch is more than ‚Äì or four times the size of its shuttered predecessor ‚Äì with an initial collection of 80,000 items. The project was built on donated by the developer, Russett Community Limited Partnership (RCLP). Russett is within the 20724 ZIP Code and falls within Maryland State Senate and House of Delegates District 32. The community also lies within Maryland's 3rd congressional district and Anne Arundel County's 4th Council District. History Russett faced growth pressures triggered by the 2005 base realignment and closure process (known as BRAC). About 22,000 defense workers were expected to relocate to nearby Fort Meade over the next several years. About 100 to 150 households would move to Russett over that period because of BRAC, according to state projections. Schools The community is served by Anne Arundel County Public Schools and several private schools.

Life and career Soejima was born into a samurai family in Saga, in Hizen Province (present-day Saga Prefecture). His father was a teacher in the domain's school and a scholar of National Learning (kokugaku). In 1866, Soejima was sent to Nagasaki by the domain leaders to study the English language. There he studied under Guido Verbeck, a Dutch missionary, giving special attention to the United States Constitution and the New Testament. During the Boshin War he was a military leader of the Saga forces committed to the overthrow of the Tokugawa bakufu. After the Meiji Restoration, Soejima became a junior councilor (san'yo) and assisted Fukuoka Takachika in drafting the structure of the provisional Meiji government in 1868. While most of Japan's government was on its around-the-world tour of the United States and Europe on the Iwakura Mission, Soejima served as interim Foreign Minister. During his term he was faced with the difficult issue of the Maria Luz Incident, involving the questions of extraterritoriality and the unequal treaties in a case involving the mistreatment of Chinese indentured laborers on a Peruvian ship. Soejima was praised by the Chinese government over his handling of the affair. In 1871, he was sent to Siberia to adjust boundary questions relating to the island of Sakhalin. In 1873, Soejima led a mission to Beijing to protest the murder of 54 crewmembers of a wrecked Ry≈´ky≈´an merchant vessel by Paiwan aborigines on the southwestern tip of Taiwan in December 1871. (The former Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom had only been formally claimed by the Empire of Japan, as Japanese sovereign territory from September 1872.) Soejima succeeded in meeting with the Tongzhi Emperor partly on the basis of the goodwill extended over the Maria Luz Incident, but Japan's demands for compensation were refused, leading to the Taiwan Expedition of 1874. However, the mission to China did succeed in establishing formal diplomatic relations between Japan and China. After the return of the Iwakura Mission and the rejection of the Seikanron proposals to invade Korea in October 1873, Soejima resigned from the government. He later joined Itagaki Taisuke and Eto Shimpei in forming the Aikoku Koto political party. On a visit to China in 1876, he was received with high honors by the mandarins by reason of his scholarship, and he became private adviser of the emperor. Soejima returned to government service in 1878, serving in the Imperial Household Ministry. In 1888 he was appointed to the Privy Council, and became its vice chairman in 1891. In 1892, he was called upon to become Home Minister in the first Matsukata administration.  Notes  References * Akamatsu, Paul. (1972). Meiji 1868: Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Japan. Trans.

Established by the Student Council at Maine Township High School, now Maine East High School, the station went on the air during December 1959. The station became known as \\"The Voice of Maine Township\\". The radio station was built by electronics teacher, Theron Whitfield, and electronics students in the school. The first student voice on the station was that of class of 1960 senior, Harrison Ford, who went on to become a major film actor in the Star Wars and the Indiana Jones film series. WMTH-FM has studios at all three existing Maine Township High Schools; Maine West High School in Des Plaines and Maine East High School and Maine South High School in Park Ridge. There was also a studio at the former Maine North High School in Des Plaines. The call letters were chosen \\"MTH\\" as in Maine Township High (school). The WMTH-FM antenna is located on the highest point of the school building at Dempster and Potter Roads in Park Ridge. The studio from 1959 through 1970 was located in room 147B, across the hall from the auditorium. When the center courtyard building opened in the fall of 1970, the radio station relocated and the first WMTH-TV television studio was built. The original power of the station was 16 watts effective radiated power at a frequency of 88.5 MHz. This continued from 1960 until 1983 when the frequency was changed to 90.5 MHz and the power reduced to 10 watts. This leaves it as one of the lowest powered FM stations in the United States, and one of few remaining under the now-discontinued Class D license. WMTH broadcasts between the hours on 9am-5pm on Weekdays only, with each Maine Township school broadcasting on a different day. A full calendar schedule can be found at WMTH ON-AIR SCHEDULE. WMTH also broadcasts online. WMTH-FM continues to broadcast a mixture of music, school sports events, and other programs of local interest.

At in length, wide and in height, it is in the Guinness World Records as the world's largest bus with a capacity for 170 passengers. History The last model of the Neoplan Jumbocruiser had a different axle formula due to its rear mounted engine. The Jumbocruiser was first manufactured in 1975 but never went into full-scale production. One Jumbocruiser, with 'extremely comfortable seating' for 80 passengers operated a route from Belgium to Spain on high intensity work and traveled some from new. This vehicle was involved in a rollover accident, initially claimed caused by a design fault but the parties concerned agreed that it was due to driver error while handling a cup of coffee. It was then rebuilt by Jumbocruiser Ltd (no connection) of Bristol in England. They used the services of Richard C≈ìur de Lyon (now called the Caross Center) near Mons in Belgium to completely strip the coach and rebuild it to a more modern design, and with modified suspension. A modern digital turntable was prepared and fitted by H√úBNER in Germany. The internal combustion engine, gearbox, braking system, wiring looms, and the dashboard were replaced and upgraded. A new dashboard with semi-digital wrap-around unit was installed in place of the original rust-prone flat unit.

Adapted and directed by Bryan Forbes (Newman's husband), this \\"romance in wheelchairs\\" was considered unusual in its time owing in part to the sexual nature of the relationship between McDowell and Newman, who play disabled people. The film received two Golden Globe nominations, for Best Foreign Film (English Language), and Best Song for \\"Long Ago Tomorrow\\". Plot Bruce Pritchard (Malcolm McDowell) is a 24-year- old working-class man and amateur football player with a passion for life. All this changes when he finds himself struck down by an incurable degenerative disease which means he'll need to use a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He goes into a church-run home for the disabled, believing that his immediate family don't feel able to care for him. His bitterness at his fate and his dislike of the rules and regulations of the place only serve to make him more withdrawn and angry at his enforced imprisonment. Pritchard gets to know a fellow patient, Jill Matthews (Nanette Newman), a 31-year-old woman from a wealthy family, who is also a wheelchair user, due to polio. Bruce begins to harbour romantic feelings for Matthews but, before he can make his feelings known, she leaves the institution to return home and marry longstanding fianc√©, Geoffrey. However, Jill soon realises that Geoffrey is half-hearted about marrying her and so breaks off the engagement and returns to the institution. Gradually, she is able to break through Pritchard's shell of cynicism and lack of respect for authority, bringing life back to his existence. In the process, the two fall in love and admit their feelings for each other, going on to get engaged. Bruce and Jill's difficult circumstances have resulted in them finding the love of their lives. Soon, though, Jill dies from a virus. Bruce almost returns to his depression but, because of the courage he has found within himself through knowing Jill, is able to go on living. Cast Production It was based on a novel by Peter Marshall, who contracted polio when he was eighteen and lived the rest of his life in a wheelchair. (He died of pneumonia in 1972.) The novel was originally published in 1964.\\"A Long Island Electra: New Novels\\", Coleman, John, The Observer, 28 June 1964: 25. Kirkus Reviews called it \\"a short novel, written with a sharpness of intelligence and feeling, and it is altogether genuine, a word easily exploited and seldom justified.\\" The New York Times called it a \\"fine, moving novel.\\"\\"Reader's Report\\" by Martin Levin, The New York Times, 17 April 1966: 319. In 1965 director Robert Butler bought the screen rights to it and another Marshall novel, Two Lives.\\"Randall Is Morocco-Bound\\", Los Angeles Times, 18 September 1965: b8. The novel was adapted for television by the BBC in 1967 as part of the Boy Meets Girl anthology series. The main parts were played by Ray Brooks and Anna Calder-Marshall. Dennis Potter, reviewing it for the New Statesman, said the production \\"kept erupting into something raw and genuine.\\"\\"Playing with People\\", Potter, Dennis, New Statesman, London, vol. 74, (July 1, 1967): 239. Film rights eventually went to producer Bruce Curtis, nephew of Harry Cohn, who had just made Otley (1969). He initially tried to finance the film through Columbia, but was turned down.\\"Dropping the Scalpel: Film Notes Columbia Frowns Speeds the Turnover Refuge From Roles\\" by Judith Martin, The Washington Post and Times-Herald, 28 February 1969: B12. Shelagh Delaney wrote a script.\\"What's so Happy About Love, Anyway?\\" by A. H. Weiler. The New York Times, 23 March 1969: D19. Eventually Curtis took the project to Bryan Forbes who came on board as writer and director. Forbes decided to increase the age of the characters and write the lead role for his wife, Nanette Newman. Forbes was in the unusual position of being able to green- light his own film as he was head of production for EMI Films at the time.\\"He Says, 'Yes, Yes, Nanette' \\" by John Gruen, The New York Times, 24 October 1971: D11. Forbes commented that he was highly criticized in some quarters for directing a film while running the studio, even though he did not take any extra salary as the director. Once the film was made some executives at EMI did not want it released but Forbes held a successful test screening which secured company support. Reception The film was not a success at the box office in the UK.\\"The eclipse of the moon man\\", Malcom, Derek. The Guardian, 26 March 1971: 15.

It is located in a hilly region where wind from the Arabian Sea gusts through mountain passes. There is a legend that Avvaiyar had arranged for a marriage, to which she invited the sovereigns of the Chera, Chola and Pandya kingdoms. This is located in between Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari Highway (NH), the nearest college from muppandal is Jayamatha Engineering College The kings erected pandals (mandapams) in the respective places allotted to them and this eventually led to the place being called Muppandal (meaning 'three pandals'). Wind power Aralvaimozhi railway station with a view of wind farm The once-impoverished village benefited from the building of the nearby Muppandal Wind Farm, a renewable energy source, which supplies the villagers with electricity for work. This is the second largest onshore wind farm in the world. The village had been selected as the showcase for India's $2 billion clean energy program which provides foreign companies with tax breaks for establishing fields of wind turbines in the area. Coordinates - [8¬∞15'39\\"N 77¬∞32'55\\"E]. Now huge power- producing windmills tower over the palm trees. The village has attracted wind energy producing companies creating thousands of new jobs, dramatically raising the incomes of villagers. The suitability of Muppandal as a site for wind farms stems from its geographical location as it has access to the seasonal monsoon winds. Now there are more sites identified for windmills around this area (Muppandal and surroundings) and wind energy generation capacity is estimated to be around 1500 MW, which is about 20% of that of India.

History =Formation and breakthrough= Formed in 1983, 4-4-1 discovered their blend of catchy beats and melodies capped with insightful lyrics in Glenn's parents‚Äô garage in Arcadia, California, the hometown of all four members. The band recorded their first demo tape of four songs (Judgment Game, Love's Irony, Mom & Dad and Break Out) in the garage and sent it to youth pastors around southern California. Randy Ziegler, who ran the very popular concert series at Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa, responded with enthusiasm and immediately met with the band and set in motion high-profile concerts as well as discussions with record labels. 4-4-1's first performances were as an opening act for a standing-room- only shows for Benny Hester and Undercover and the band was met with great enthusiasm from the crowds. The band completed their first record at Doug Doyle's 3-D Studios under the new label Royal Commandment (later to be named Blue Collar Records) and released it in early November 1984. Both the song ‚ÄúBreak Out‚Äù and the self-titled album debuted at the top position on so-cal CCM radio station KYMS, a first for any act and topping the hugely successful new release by U2, ‚ÄúThe Unforgettable Fire‚Äù and their legendary hit ‚ÄúPride (In the Name of Love).‚Äù ‚Äú4-4-1‚Äù stayed in the top 40 for several months and the band was named 1984's ‚ÄúBest New Band‚Äù in the KYMS listener music awards. =National exposure= The band completed their second album, Mourning Into Dancing in the summer of 1985. Produced by Dino and John Elefante of Kansas fame, the disc showed a more mature sound and consistently stronger songwriting. Joined by groups Undercover and Adam Again, the newly renamed Blue Collar Records aggressively promoted their trifecta of bands and ‚ÄúMourning Into Dancing‚Äù debuted on the CCM Magazine top 40 sales chart and the title track rose to number two on the national rock charts. 4-4-1 toured extensively off the success of their two hit records, playing energetic sets at the Icthus and Cornerstone festivals in 1986. Blue Collar Records declared bankruptcy in 1987 based on non-payment of record sales from its distributor, leaving the band (as well as Undercover and Adam Again) looking for a home. =Breakup= With the failure of their label and new priorities for several of the members, 4-4-1 consequently chose to end their run as a group in mid-1987. 4-4-1 played their last concert at Knott's Berry Farm on May 1, 1987. =Sacrifice= John McNamara and Glenn Holland, the songwriters for the band, continued writing. At the same time, Ojo Taylor (Undercover) and Gene Eugene (Adam Again) were reviving Maranantha!‚Äôs Broken Records and with it, production company Brainstorm Artists International. Subsequently, the duo came to agreement with Broken for a third 4-4-1 album, with the other two members‚Äô blessing to use the name of the band. ‚ÄúSacrifice,‚Äù was released on Broken Records/ Brainstorm Artists International and distributed by Word Records in 1988. Produced with Gene Eugene, the project was a departure, with a more introspective and moody feel, largely based on the duo's strange experiences in the world of Christian music. The ‚Äúnew‚Äù 4-4-1 toured the region on a limited basis in promotion of the record, with Glenn's brother Kenny Holland on drums (Kenny had played on the studio tracks) and John Gaudesi, Kenny's bandmate from the L.A.-based hard rock outfit, Cats & Dogs, on guitar. With family commitments looming, Holland and McNamara decided to stop pursuing a musical path so aggressively. Subsequently, 4-4-1 ‚Äúproper‚Äù reformed in the early 1990s for several concerts, including a New Year's Eve performance with The 77s at Calvary Chapel West Covina in 1992. The band performed their last gig on July 4, 1993. Reunion In 2005, after a long period of inactivity, the group once again began to play some concerts in southern California, including the Broken Reunion show on August 19, 2005 with Undercover, The Choir, The Altar Boys and Crumb√§cher. 4-4-1 also played the Spirit West Coast festival in Del Mar, California in May, 2006. As of November 2006, the band is working on new material for a possible album project in 2007. A week before their breakout reunion in 2005, Bassist Glenn Holland was diagnosed with cancer. This album relives the tough times that the band was dealing with through their hits such as \\"Break Out\\", \\"Mourning Into Dancing\\" and the heartfelt \\"Is It Enough\\". They performed in a concert at Mission Hills Church in Orange County, California on March 28, 2009. They played with up and coming band, Sun From Shadows.

Career  Before joining Shonen Knife, Michie spent some time working as a cartoonist's assistant. In 1995, Nakatani collaborated with Big Dipper's Gary Waleik on a project called The Japanese Beatles. They recorded one single. In 1997, just as Shonen Knife were about to embark on a tour of Australia and New Zealand, Michie came down with a bout of appendicitis. She was able to recover in time to join the band in Australia. During the New Zealand dates bass duties were handled by Atsushi Shibata. She stayed with Shonen Knife from December 1981 until December 1999. In early 1999, when she decided to leave the band, Naoko and Atsuko tried to talk her out of it, but she was firm on her decision to leave so in the end they reluctantly had to let her go. After Michie's departure, Atsuko moved from drums to bass guitar, with Mana Nishiura taking over as Shonen Knife's touring drummer until her death in 2005. Shonen Knife continues to perform songs written by Michie, with vocal duties split between current bassist Ritsuko Taneda and Naoko. Since her retirement, Michie has retreated from public life, giving up music altogether. She hasn't appeared publicly with Shonen Knife since 1999. In 2002, the book Hokkaido Popsicle written by Isaac Adamson, used (by permission) a lyric from the song \\"Catnip Dream\\", written by Michie.  Quotes  \\"I have frogphobia. I just don't like frogs. There's just something... I really don't like frogs.\\" \\"We've always enjoyed writing songs about everyday things. Besides, there are already enough bands out there singing about pollution, war and poverty. While we all care very much about those things, we also feel that music should be fun.\\" \\"I really love good pop music.

It is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name by William Kennedy, who also wrote the screenplay. It stars Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep, with Carroll Baker, Michael O'Keefe, Diane Venora, Fred Gwynne, Nathan Lane and Tom Waits in supporting roles. The story concerns the relationship of a homeless couple: Francis, an alcoholic, and Helen, a terminally ill woman during the years following the Great Depression. Major portions of the film were shot on location in Albany, New York, including Jay Street at Lark Street, Albany Rural Cemetery and the Miss Albany Diner on North Broadway. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Nicholson) and Best Actress in a Leading Role (Streep). Synopsis During the 1930s depression Francis Phelan (Jack Nicholson) wanders the city. Francis is a washed-up and retired baseball player who deserted his family back in the 1910s, when he accidentally dropped his infant son to the ground, causing the child's death. It is implied that he was drunk at the time, but Francis claims he was just tired and doesn't understand why no one will believe in his story. Since then, he has been a bum, roaming the streets and punishing himself by remembering men that he knew and died while he was younger in different circumstances. Wandering into his hometown of Albany on Halloween in 1938, Phelan seeks out his lover and drinking companion, Helen Archer (Meryl Streep). The two meet up in a mission managed by Reverend Chester (James Gammon), and later in Oscar Reo's (Fred Gwynne) gin mill. Over the next few days, Phelan takes a few minor jobs to support Helen, while haunted by visions of his past. Eventually, Francis comes back to his old family house and tries to make peace with his wife Annie Phelan (Carroll Baker), his son Billy (Michael O'Keefe) and daughter Peg (Diane Venora). Meanwhile, a group of local vigilantes take it upon themselves to drive the homeless out of Albany by violent means. During the course of the day, a series of events unfold and change Francis' life forever.

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 58% based on reviews from 24 critics. At the time of its release it garnered enthusiasm because of the presence of stars Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep. Roger Ebert wrote, \\"Nicholson and Streep play drunks in Ironweed, and actors are said to like to play drunks, because it gives them an excuse for overacting. But there is not much visible 'acting' in this movie; the actors are too good for that.\\" Ebert gave the film three stars out of four.Roger Ebert (February, 1988) \\"Ironweed\\" Streep received raves from most critics; Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that \\"Meryl Streep, as ever, is uncanny. Miss Streep uses the role of Helen as an opportunity to deliver a stunning impersonation of a darty-eyed, fast- talking woman of the streets, an angry, obdurate woman with great memories and no future. There isn't much more to the film's Helen than this, and indeed the character may go no deeper, but she's a marvel all the same. Behind the runny, red-rimmed eyes, the nervous chatter and the haunted expression, Miss Streep is even more utterly changed than her costar, and she even sings well. The sequence in which Helen entertains the real and imagined patrons of a bar room with a rendition of 'He's Me Pal' is a standout.\\"Maslin, Janet. The New York Times (December, 1987) \\"Ironweed (1987) Film: 'Ironweed,' From Hector Babenco\\" Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat appreciated the film's spiritual message, writing, \\"Mixing realistic and surreal scenes, Argentinean director H√©ctor Babenco puts the accent on what he calls the spiritual dimensions of William Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel...

It serves to guide the auditor on obtaining audit evidence through the application of an appropriate mix of tests of control systems and substantive tests of transaction and balances. It requests the auditor to obtain 'sufficient' and 'appropriate' audit evidence in order to draw reasonable conclusions on which to base the audit opinion. The auditor considers reliability of audit evidence collected. For instance, audit evidence is more reliable when it exists in documentary form rather than subsequent oral representation of the matters. Auditors consider reliability of information but involve little authentication of evidence. Financial statement assertions It is stated in ISA 315 (paragraph A.124) that the auditor should use assertions for classes of transactions, account balances, and presentation and disclosures in sufficient detail to form a basis for the assessment of risks of material misstatement and the design and performance of further audit procedures. The auditor uses assertions in assessing risks by considering potential misstatements that may occur, and thereby designing audit procedures that are responsive to the particular risks. Assertions used by the auditor fall into the following categories: (a) Assertions about classes of transactions and events for the period ended: # Occurrence # Completeness # Accuracy # Cut-off # Classification (b) Assertions about account balances at the period end: # Existence # Rights and obligations # Completeness # Valuation and allocation (c) Assertions about presentation and disclosure: # Occurrence # Completeness # Classification and understandability # Accuracy and valuation The assertions are not individually assessed but quite often at the same time. For example, to ensure completeness of electricity expense, the auditor ensures the 12 months of payments were booked. Since the client may record the bills paid on a cash basis, electricity expense of a month of previous basis period might be entered in the current year. Electricity expense of last month of current year might be recorded next year. If the monthly fluctuation is immaterial, the auditor always ignore the cut-off issue. In case where electricity is a material expense, the auditor considers preparing adjustments for year ended cut-off purpose so that the profit or loss would not be materially misstated. Methods or techniques of audit evidence gathering are classified in 7 categories: 1\\\\. Inspection This involves physical examination of supporting accounting documentation, contracts, records and board of director minutes. It also includes physical examination of the assets. This enables the auditor to verify the existence but not necessarily ownership and valuation of assets. 2\\\\. Observation This involves looking at a process or procedure being performed by others. For instance, observation of payment of wages and salaries, physical count of inventory or opening of mail. This helps the auditor to have an assurance whether official procedures are followed 3\\\\. Inquiry Inquiry consists of seeking information of knowledgeable person inside or outside the entity. It may range from formal written inquiry to oral inquiries. Confirmation consists of corroborating evidence from third parties with the internal evidence. For instance the auditor may verify accounts receivables by circularizing the debtors. 4\\\\. Confirmation (audit) 5\\\\. Re- performance 6\\\\. Analytical procedures 7\\\\. Recalculation, it means to check the mathematical accuracy of the figures in the book, for e.g; Reculation of Accruals and Prepayments This involves analysis of significant accounting ratios and trend performance including investigations of fluctuations that occur between the current financial performance with the previous one and check whether other information is consistent with such relationship. For examp, the auditor perform vouching to ensure such electricity expense occurred and whether correct amount was booked. The auditor compares electricity expense of current and last year to see whether there are fluctuations. If there are huge fluctuations, the auditor may examine electricity together with rental expense, water expense to find out reasons.

It was called Galician army initially. Dissatisfied with the alliance of Ukraine and Poland it joined the army of Anton Denikin in November 1919, was renamed into Ukrainian Galician Army and later joined the Red Army as the Red Ukrainian Galician Army in 1920. After the part of it joined allied Ukrainian and Polish army and especially after Ukrainian celebrations in Odessa it was disbanded by the Reds, many officers were shot by the Red Army, many officers were in Polish concentration camps.–ê. Philipenko. Ukrainian Galician army and its tragedy in Odessa. //History of Odessa Military equipment The Ukrainian Galician Army obtained its arms from Austrian depots and from the demobilized Austrian and German troops who streamed through Galicia by the hundreds of thousands following the collapse of the Central Powers at the end of World War I. However, the centers of Austria's military industry lay far from Galicia, and subsequent difficulty with resupply was a major factor in the Galicians losing their war against Poland. Armed Forces Nieuport 17 of the Ukrainian Galician Army Dmytro Vitovsky, first commander of the Ukrainian Galician Army, flanked by two officers, 1918 The government of the West Ukrainian People's Republic was well organized and was able to mobilize over 100,000 people by spring 1919, 40,000 of whom were battle-ready. Due to the Ukrainians' generally poor socioeconomic status, the army had a disproportionately low ratio of officers to other ranks. In the Austro-Hungarian Army, ethnic Ukrainians had accounted for only two out of 1,000 officers (in comparison, Poles had made up 27/1,000 officers in the Austrian military). As a result, although most of the junior rank officers were Galicians the government of the West Ukrainian People's Republic relied largely on former high-ranking officers of the defunct Russian Army, such as General Mykhailo Omelianovych- Pavlenko, to take on the post of commander and general staff. It also staffed many positions with unemployed Austrian and German officers. For this reason, the German language was the easiest way for officers to communicate with each other and was the dominant language among the staff.Yaroslav Tinchenko, General Oleksander Hrekiv: Military Actions and Fate Journal of Memorial pg. 33 (Ukrainian) Despite these measures, only approximately 2.4% of the army consisted of officers.

The Ukrainian Galician Army reached its greatest strength in June 1919, where it had 70,000 to 75,000 men, including reserves. It had very limited cavalry but artillery, consisting of ex-Austrian pieces, was a strong point. The UHA had 2-3 armored cars and two armored trains. The UHA's air force, organized by Petro Franko (son of the poet Ivan Franko), fielded 40 airplanes, and until April 1919 enjoyed air superiority over the Polish forces. =Sich Riflemen= A former unit of the Austro-Hungarian Army, the 1st Brigade of Sich Riflemen () became the elite force of the Ukrainian Galician Army during the war against Poland. It was formed in 1914 by former members of youth and paramilitary organizations and fought in Galicia and Ukraine against the Russian Empire throughout the first world war. At its peak this brigade had 8,600 men, not all of whom fought in Galicia. =Jewish Battalion= The Ukrainian Galician Army fielded a Jewish battalion () recruited from Jewish university and high school students in Ternopil and led by Lieutenant Solomon Leimberg.

Career Stuart was signed to Celtic as a schoolboy S-Former in 1989 and followed the route of many on to the groundstaff at 16 in 1990. He played Youth and Reserve team football and was released to play for Giffnock Park North AFC. He ended the 91/92 season close to a first team call up and won a new two-year contract. The next season marked his debut with one appearance against Aberdeen 92/93 but a groin strain in October curtailed his 92/93 season. In the 93/94 season he lost his edge playing with the Premier Reserves and asked for a loan move south of the border. He spent some time on loan with Bournemouth in February before returning to more Reserve team action. At the end of the season he went to Canada on the post-season tournament with the senior team. Out of contract at the start of the 94/95 season, he was wanted by Sunderland and Blackburn Rovers and signing month-to-month deals. He eventually signed a new deal on 27 January 1995 with the stated intention of leaving if he did not get more first team football. He had a reasonable run of games and was on the verge of the full-time first team inclusion. In the 95/96 season he won starting appearances in the latter part of the season but an ankle ligament injury proved troubling and curtailed full involvement. The 96/97 Season was troubled by a knee injury and he ended playing most of the season with the Reserves. Out of contract again his future looked uncertain. A deal to take him to Lille fell through in the close season and he began the 97/98 season on month-to-month deals. In October he was loaned to Greenock Morton until January 1998, being recalled from Greenock to play against them in the Scottish Cup tie on 24 January. He played a few more Reserve games before being sold to Tommy Burns at Reading on 26 March 1998. He was loaned to Rushden & Diamonds and joined them full-time in January 2001 and released at the end of the 04/05 season. He joined Oxford United making 10 appearances with them.

First appearing in Harbinger #1 (Jan. 1992), he is the star of the Harbinger comic book series, where he leads a group of renegade Harbingers against Toyo Harada and the Harbinger Foundation. Story Toyo Harada is the first publicly known Harbinger, and unlike subsequent Harbingers he was able to make his powers manifest at will, or activate the powers of others. Harada is an Omega Harbinger: he commands the full spectrum of psionic abilities, which he uses to create a multinational corporation and amass a large fortune. Fearing the world is on a course to destroy itself, he plans to take it over and mold it to his specifications. To this end he creates the Harbinger Foundation, which actively searches for potential Harbingers. Pete Stanchek is a normal teenager until he develops Harbinger abilities. After seeing an advertisement he contacts the Harbinger Foundation. Harada is intrigued by Pete, who is the only other Harbinger to have triggered his own powers and who exhibits multiple abilities. Harada is no longer the only Omega Harbinger. Harada tries to persuade Pete to join the Harbinger Foundation and become Harada's right- hand man, but when Pete's best friend, who had been vocal about his distrust for Harada, is murdered by the Foundation, Pete realizes the truth. Pete, along with Kris (a high school cheerleader who, he later realizes, he had been unconsciously mentally controlling so that she would go out with him) become renegades. They decide to recruit Harbingers themselves, activate their abilities and form an army capable of challenging Harada. Later in the series, it is revealed that Harada has in fact been mentally manipulating the Harbinger rebels, and Pete and Harada face off in a battle royale. Harada is left comatose and Pete supposedly powerless. Pete's fellow renegades go their separate ways, with Pete wandering off into the night with his teammate Flamingo, only to resurface later on as \\"The Harbinger,\\" an armored, brainwashed servant of Harada, hunting down new rogue Harbingers. He is opposed by the mysterious masked hero \\"The Visitor,\\" who in turn is revealed to be an alternate future version of Pete himself. At the close of the Visitor's self-titled series, the present-day Pete breaks free from his programming and is forced to join forces with Harada and the Visitor to save the world from an alien invasion. After their triumph and the death of the Visitor, Pete warns Harada to leave him and Flamingo alone. Homosexuality According to Jim Shooter, the character of Pete Stanchek was meant to have been gay. Titles featuring the character were cancelled before this was revealed, although it was heavily implied in the pages of Shooter's unpublished Unity 2000 miniseries, in which a villainness offers to change her form to that of a man to appeal to Pete.

The museum says one of its aims is to \\"help to de-mystify homosexuality among people... we hope to reject the all too well known argument that homosexual behaviour is a crime against nature.\\" Most of the exhibition is based on the works of Bruce Bagemihl and Joan Roughgarden. The exhibition was initiated by the Norwegian Archive, Library and Museum Authority (ABM) as part of their \\"Break\\" program, encouraging museums, libraries and archives to do research and exhibitions of controversial and taboo subjects. The exhibition is a direct answer to this challenge, and has received financial support from ABM. The exhibition ran from September 2006 to August 2007. Reception It was well received, including by the museum's regular visiting groups, mainly families.Europe  Oslo gay animal show draws crowds. BBC News (2006-10-19). Retrieved on 2011-02-15.

The exhibition has been criticized by some philosophy scholars, who state that the exhibit misses the point of the original terminology attributed to homosexual activity as \\"against nature\\".

Wein graduated from Pittsburgh's Taylor Allderdice High School in 1956. He lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts where he attended Harvard, graduating in 1961. A thesis he had written, centering on Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, remained as a particular source of pride for him. Continuing to reside in Cambridge, he affected the appearance of an 1890s Edwardian dandy, similar to that of the British Teddy Boys, was a successful racetrack bettor and lived what was described as a Bohemian lifestyle. In 1963, while at his therapist's office, he met Radcliffe student Edie Sedgwick and when, upon turning 21 in 1964, she moved to New York, he went with her and began acting as her promoter. Gifted with a glib vocabulary and blonde good looks, he insinuated himself into Andy Warhol's circle of intimates and, by January 1965, had introduced Edie Sedgwick to Warhol and began regularly taking her to Warhol's studio, The Factory. The celebrity-obsessed Warhol and Sedgwick quickly became fascinated with each other and, by the time Warhol invited Wein and Sedgwick to accompany him to Paris in April 1965 for the opening of an exhibition of his paintings, he announced that Edie Sedgwick would be his new \\"superstar\\" and the \\"Queen of The Factory\\". Wein wrote and became Warhol's assistant director on Beauty No. 2, a 65-minute feature which presents a barely dressed Sedgwick in bed with Warhol regular Gino Piserchio, reacting and responding to the off-screen voice of the never-shown Wein who harasses her with intimate and annoying questions and comments which Piserchio does not seem to hear or be aware of. The film premiered at the Paris Cin√©math√®que in July 1965, making Warhol and Sedgwick darlings of the international celebrity circuit, with Wein and Piserchio also basking in the spotlight. The years 1965 and early 1966 represented the peak period for the Warhol-Sedgwick-Wein collaboration, resulting in nine films, but before the end of the year, a disillusioned Edie Sedgwick left Warhol, never to return. Little more than two years later, in the wake of Warhol's diminished activity following his near-fatal shooting by Valerie Solanas on June 3, 1968, Wein also departed and began traveling the world, with particular emphasis on the Far East, and managing fringe nightclub acts which usually had some unusual, strange or whimsical characteristics, as well as focusing on the occult. He can be seen in the 1967 documentary short about Warhol, Superartist and, in 1971, was credited as director of the Jimi Hendrix concert film Rainbow Bridge. Although the day and month of his birth have remained elusive (although see the IMDb entry below), Wein would have marked his 68th birthday in 2008, the year he died in Del Mar, California, fifteen months after the release of Factory Girl, director George Hickenlooper's cinematic retelling of Edie Sedgwick's (Sienna Miller) brief life, with particular emphasis on her time with Warhol (Guy Pearce) and Wein, whose portrayal by Jimmy Fallon was tepidly noted by critics as being \\"convincing\\" and \\"adequate\\".

Although the top end of the string is not fixed, the length of this inextensible string is still a constant. The distance between the top end and the weight must stay the same.

Early life Shoemaker was born on a farm in Flora Township, Renville County, Minnesota, and was self-educated with his mother‚Äôs assistance. He engaged in agricultural pursuits and worked for many farm and labor organizations. He was a charter member and organizer of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party. While Shoemaker was an organizer for the Nonpartisan League in 1920 he was attacked by the pastor of his church as Shoemaker had claimed that despite not being physically fit to enter the army and having a dependent wife was drafted with him being the only married man in the area to be so, but did not appeal the decision. In actuality other married men were drafted, Shoemaker was deemed physically fit, and had filed an appeal to the draft board. Career In 1924 he assisted in organizing the Federated Farmer-Labor Party at Chicago in 1924. Shoemaker was nominated for Vice President of the United States, but declined to run. He served as editor and publisher of the People‚Äôs Voice, Green Bay Farmer, and Progressive Farmer newspapers in Green Bay, Wisconsin, from 1921 to 1927, and of the Organized Farmer newspaper in Red Wing, Minnesota in 1928. In 1931 he served nine months at Leavenworth penitentiary after being convicted for a federal charge of sending defamatory material through the mail and for violation of his probation. Shoemaker was elected as a Farmer-Laborite to the 73rd congress. A House vote was held to determine whether or not to seat him and he was permitted retain his seat with 230 votes in his favor against 75 votes. During his tenure Shoemaker filed an impeachment resolution against United States District Judge Joseph W. Molyneaux which amounted to little. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1934 to the 74th congress, but was an unsuccessful candidate for nomination for Minnesota's Senate seat, but lost in the primary to incumbent Henrik Shipstead. Later life After twenty two years of marriage Shoemaker's wife, Lydgia Schneider, filed for divorce in 1934, due to him openly committing adultery and threatening her. In 1940 Shoemaker was sent to jail for 90 days after assaulting a neighbor and being accused of throwing hot water into his former wife's face. Later he filed to run in the Farmer-Labor primary for Minnesota's seventh congressional district, but came in last place with 11% of the vote. He then became an unsuccessful Independent candidate for reelection to the 74th congress. After an unsuccessful election campaign in 1942 to the 78th congress, he resumed agricultural pursuits near North Redwood, Minnesota. He died at University of Minnesota Hospitals in Minneapolis on July 24, 1958, and was buried in Zion Cemetery in Flora Township, Renville County, Minnesota.

Background  Sirven became an archivist and notary in Castres, southern France, in 1736. He was a Protestant with three daughters; the middle one, Elizabeth, was mentally handicapped. Protestants suffered serious disabilities in France at the time and were frequently persecuted by the authorities, often on flimsy excuses. The case of Jean Calas, the subject of another of Voltaire's campaigns, had shown that legal authorities were fully prepared to ignore basic principles of law and justice in acting against members of the minority religion. The Toulouse parlement (high court) which took the decision in the Calas case also had jurisdiction over the authorities that would eventually try Sirven. Elizabeth disappeared on 6 March 1760, aged 21. After having searched for her without success, Sirven learned that she had been taken into the convent of the Dames Noires (the ‚Äòblack ladies‚Äô, a convent founded in 1686 to keep daughters of Protestants sent to them under a lettre de cachet, the infamous means by which certain persons in authority could lock away those against whom they had a grudge, without trial or appeal). On 9 October 1760, Elizabeth suffered such a mental breakdown as a result of the ill treatment she received from the Dames Noires that they released her. Sirven was so angry over the state of his daughter that he publicly denounced her treatment by the Dames Noires. They retaliated with a lawsuit accusing him of mistreating his daughter in order to prevent her conversion to Catholicism. They obtained an order against Sirven to allow Elizabeth free access to the convent and to accompany her himself to the services. At the end of August 1761, the Sirven family moved to Saint Alby, near Mazamet, to avoid further persecution. On 16 December, Elizabeth disappeared again. Two weeks of searching yielded no results but on 3 January 1762 three children found her body down a well. Initially medical examinations found that she had suffered no violence but, under pressure from the public prosecutor Trinquier of Mazamet, they changed their evidence to say that Elizabeth had not died by drowning. A warrant for Sirven's arrest was issued on 20 January 1762, but the family was able to escape in time. A sentence passed on them in absentia on 29 March 1764 condemned the father to be broken on the wheel, the mother to be hanged and the two surviving daughters to be banished. Their effigies were burned in Mazamet on 11 September 1764.  Appeal to Voltaire  The Sirven family took refuge in Lausanne and made contact with Voltaire. Though he was already heavily embroiled in the case to clear Calas's name, he reacted to the Sirven case with the same anger as he had to the earlier one. On 30 March 1765, he wrote to Damilaville (Voltaire Foundation Complete Edition, letter D12511): > J'attends tous les jours √† Toulouse la copie authentique de l'arr√™t qui > condamne toute la famille Sirven; arr√™t confirmatif de la sentence rendue > par un juge de village; arr√™t donn√© sans connaissance de cause; arr√™t contre > lequel tout le public se soul√©verait avec indignation si les Calas ne > s'√©taient pas empar√©s de toute sa piti√©. > I am expecting to receive from Toulouse any day now an authentic copy of the > decree condemning the entire Sirven family; a decree confirming the sentence > pronounced by a village judge; a decree issued without knowledge of the > case; a decree against which the whole public would rise in indignation if > the Calas family had not already won all its pity. √âtienne No√´l Damilaville (1723-1768) was a valuable ally of Voltaire and the philosophes: as a clerk in the revenue service (Bureau du Vingti√®me) he could use the minister's seal on correspondence, ensuring its immunity from censorship. Voltaire used him heavily as an agent in his campaign to support the Sirven family in its legal proceedings. As well as legal acton, Voltaire came to Sirven's assistance with his most powerful weapon, his pen. In June 1766, he published his Avis au public sur les parricides imput√©s aux Calas et aux Sirven (Notice to the public concerning the parricides alleged against the Calas and Sirven families). He despatched the pamphlet, along with a published version of a letter of his to Damilaville of 1 March 1765, to influential figures in France and abroad, to build the pressure on the authorities to act. It still took until 23 January 1768 to persuade the Conseil du Roi (Royal Council) to consider the case, and Sirven's plea was rejected. The ministers of the king were afraid of appearing to limit the prerogatives of the provincial courts.  Rehabilitation  The next stage required Sirven to take a serious risk and give himself up to the authorities, remembering that those same authorities had broken and killed Calas on the wheel when they had him in their power. He returned to Mazamet in 1769 and was remanded in custody to await the decision of the Toulouse parlement. The mood in Toulouse had changed radically since the Calas case, partly in response to the public outcry over that case, partly as a result of the formation of the more liberal ministry in Paris headed by Maupeou. Sirven was released in December 1769 and on 25 November 1771 the Toulouse parlement overturned the original sentence, rehabilitated the entire Sirven family and ordered the town of Mazamet to pay compensation. Sirven wrote to Voltaire on 27 November (D17479): > Je vous dois la vie, et plus que cela le r√©tablissement de mon honneur, et > de ma r√©putation. Le parlement me jugea avant hier. Il a purg√© la m√©moire de > feue mon √©pouse et nous a relax√©s de l'indigne accusation imagin√©e par les > fanatiques Castrois, m'a accord√© la main lev√©e des biens et effets saisis, > avec restitution des fruits, et m'a accord√© les d√©pens. [‚Ä¶] Votre nom > Monsieur, et l'int√©r√™t que vous preni√©s √† ma cause ont √©t√© d'un grand poids. > Vous m'avi√©s jug√© et le public instruit n'a pas os√© penser autrement que > vous, en √©clairant les hommes vous √™tes parvenu √† les rendre humains. > I owe you my life, and more still, the restoration of my honour, and of my > reputation. The parliament judged my case the day before yesterday. It has > cleared the memory of my late wife and acquitted us of the unworthy > accusation dreamed up by the fanatics of Castres, awarded me freely the > goods and effects that had been seized, with interest, and awarded me my > costs. [‚Ä¶] Your name Sir, and the interest that you took in my case have had > great weight. You judged my case and the informed public did not dare think > differently from you, by enlightening people you have succeeded in making > them human. At the time that Sirven was finally exonerated, Voltaire was already 77, making the energy and tenacity of his campaign all the more remarkable.

Tulpar (, , , , , ) is a winged or swift horse in Turkic mythology (for example, Kazakh and Tatar mythology), similar to Pegasus. Tulpar is also in state emblems of Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Bashkortostan. The coat of arms of Kazakhstan Tulpar came to be due to the hunting lifestyle of the people of Central Asia. The people hunted with horses, with the company of a bird of prey. These two animals, with the human imagination, formed into one creating the winged horse known as Tulpar. This mythical creature has also been used as state symbols of Kazakhstan, the emblem of which is decorated with two golden Tulpars, the top of a yurt (the yurt is a traditional tent where the Kazakhs lived) and the sun rays. The blue background represents the sky where the Tulpars run. Tulpar is the legendary horse that appears in culture of Turkic- speaking nations (Turks, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, etc.). The association of a bird with a horse can also be changed to that of a sight hound. A picture of a sight hound coming together with a picture of a legendary horse allowed for the word Tulpar to form, which is the kennel name. The wings were not necessarily for flight but to emphasize their speed. These horses shared their lives with their masters.

The new branding and on-air design was done by three agencies namely Flint Skallen, Perfect Accident and Velvet (which worked on the new idents for Oman TV). Viewers will notice the change right away, as the channels logo has been modernized, dumping the previous style which featured the colors of the national flag and two crossed swords (part of the national emblem). The new logo, using curvy letters, creates a fresh look for the organization and was showcased in some brand promotional videos for the launch. The main news studio features a 6√ó3 video wall camera center, flanked by two patterned walls which glow blue. These walls feature a unique curved cutout that repeats across the space. The anchor desk uses a two-toned curved shape atop a pointed riser. The set features a small pod and a secondary 3√ó2 video wall, which is used primarily for sports. The main news studio is located adjacent to the newsroom, with a track camera connecting the two for newscast openings. Graphically, the networks main bulletins begin with panels of glass revolving in a circle, culminating in a floating layered world map scene. Throughout, layers of maps and micro-text are seen. In segment opens, the panels contain photos, such as for sports. The updated look debuted December 31, 2015.

Originally just a sans-serif font, it was extended with additional serif designs. Syntax Syntax is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Meier in 1968, and released in 1969 by the D. Stempel Schriftgie√üerei (type foundry) of Frankfurt am Main. It is believed to be the final face designed and released by D. Stempel for foundry casting. The original drawings were done in 1954; first by writing the letters with a brush, then redrawing their essential linear forms, and finally adding balanced amounts of weight to the skeletons to produce optically monoline letterforms. In the period 1968‚Äì1972, Meier worked on additional weights and variations to the Syntax typeface. In 1989, the original foundry metal design was digitized by Adobe, which also expanded the family to include bold and ultrabold weights, resulting in a font family of 4 romans and 1 italic (in lightest weight) fonts. Meier described Syntax as being a sans-serif face modeled on the Renaissance serif typeface, similar to Sabon or Bembo. The uppercase has a wide proportion, and the terminals not being parallel to the baseline provide a sense of animation. The lowercase a and g follow the old style model of having two storeys. The italics are a combination of humanist italic forms, seen in the lowercase italic q, and the obliques of industrial or grotesque sans-serifs, seen in the lowercase italic a, which retains two storeys, unlike in other humanist sans-serif typefaces like FF Scala Sans and Gill Sans, where the a has a single storey italic. On its release Jan Tschichold praised Syntax as \\"very easy to read, well designed: better than the related Gill Sans\\". =Different brand names and derivative fonts= Bitstream released Syntax under the name Humanist 531. The family does not include an italic font. Infinitype released Syntax under the name Saxony, including an italic and medium font. The Cyrillic version was developed at ParaType in 1999 by Isay Slutskertdc: Isay Solomonovich Slutsker and Manvel Shmavonyan. =Oberon version= Bitmap of Meier's hand-optimized Syntax bitmap fonts as they appeared in the Oberon operating system. The Syntax font family was chosen by Niklaus Wirth for the Oberon operating system. During part of the period that Oberon was under development, Meier worked in Wirth's group at ETH, developing hand-optimized bitmap versions of the Syntax fonts (this was in the days prior to font anti-aliasing). Linotype Syntax In 1995, Hans Eduard Meier and Linotype began to produce an extensive revision and expansion of the Syntax font family. Based on original font design, the alterations made to accommodate hot metal and phototypesetting machines were discarded. The family was expanded to 6 weights with italics on all weights. All fonts include old style figures and proportional lining figures, while 3 lightest weights also include small caps glyphs. Regular and bold weight fonts also include Cyrillic characters. Letters such as @, C, R, Ô¨Å, Ô¨Ç, were redesigned. The font family was released in 2000. Linotype Syntax Lapidar It is a variant of Linotype Syntax, but modelled after chiseled letter forms of the ancient Greeks. Linotype Syntax Lapidar is available in two different design forms: Linotype Syntax Lapidar Text and Linotype Syntax Lapidar Display. Linotype Syntax Lapidar Text supports old style figures, while Linotype Syntax Lapidar Display supports titling capitals. Both families come in 5 weights of roman fonts, covering Basic Latin to ISO Latin-1 character sets, available in TrueType or PostScript Type 1 formats. Linotype Syntax Lapidar Serif It is a variant of Linotype Syntax containing serifs. Like the sans-serif version, it comes with Text and Display designs with same amount of fonts per family, and covers same character sets. However, Linotype Syntax Lapidar Serif Display does not support titling capitals. Linotype Syntax Letter It is a variant of Linotype Syntax modelled after the style of the Roman Rustic capitals. This family come in 6 weights with complementary italic fonts on all weights, covering ISO Adobe 2, Adobe CE, Latin Extended character sets. OpenType features include old style figures. Linotype Syntax Serif It is a variant of Linotype Syntax with serifs. This family come in 6 weights with complementary italic fonts on all weights, covering ISO Adobe 2, Adobe CE, Latin Extended character sets. OpenType features include old style figures, with small caps and proportional lining figures on 3 lightest weights. Badiya It is an Arabic variant designed by Nadine Chahine, based on the original Syntax. Badiya, which means \\"desert\\" in Arabic, is a modern and slightly modulated Naskh. The design has open counters that enable it to be used in quite small sizes, optimized for print in magazines and corporate communication. 2 roman fonts, in regular and bold weights, were produced. It supports ISO Adobe 2, Latin Extended, Arabic, Persian, and Urdu characters, tabular numerals for the supported languages.

History The church was composed of the majority of the Bible Presbyterian Church which left that denomination over what it felt was the strong influence of Carl McIntire and the fundamentalists, while the new church (then the BPC Columbus Synod) had a stronger emphasis on the Reformed aspect of belief and practice. This split occurred in 1956. Carl McIntire developed into a rather heavy-handed, dictatorial leader in the BP denomination and some of his colleagues like Buswell and Harris and younger men, most notably Donald MacNair and Robert Rayburn, began resisting this trend. Tensions came to a head in 1955, when the entire BP Church numbered about 8,760 members (the OPC was about the same size at this time). About 43% of the church followed McIntire in leaving and they formed what came to be known as the BP Church, Collingswood (NJ) Synod; the majority remained in what was initially known as the BP Church, Columbus (OH) Synod. The BPC-Columbus Synod renamed itself the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in 1961 to avoid the confusion with the Bible Presbyterian church, Collingswood Synod. During this time it also established Covenant College and Covenant Theological Seminary as denominational institutions. =Merger= The church had a short lifespan, as it entered merger talks with the Reformed Presbyterian Church in North America, General Synod (RPCGS) and merged with that group in 1965 to form the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod (which itself merged into the Presbyterian Church in America in 1982). =The Reformed Presbyterian Church in North America, General Synod= The Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod adhered to the Solemn League and Covenant and was of the Covenanter tradition. It was formed in 1833 when the Reformed Presbyterian Church divided over issue of allegiance to the Constitution. One group named Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod allowed its members to vote and to hold office. The General Synod permitted instrumental music during the worship and adopted hymns and psalms to be sung in the services. The other group the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America did not allow members to vote and hold office and opposed hymns and instrumental music. Notable personalities *J.

Description  The ringed kingfisher (Megaceryle torquata) is a Neotropical kingfisher that lives in habitats ranging between the US and Mexico. In 1888, the species was first discovered in the US, while the first ringed kingfisher nest was found in 1970. They are commonly seen along the Rio Grande and in water bodies in southern Texas. Their distribution is increasing and expanding upwards. = Measurement = The wings of adult males range between , which on average measures . Their tail range between , and the bill measures .

Several individuals have a white collar located around the neck. = Plumage = Each ringed kingfisher possesses 10 primaries, 15 secondaries, 3 tertials and 12 rectrices. Wings are rounded, and tail is squared. Subspecies can be found in Texas, Mexico, Central America and South America, due to slight plumage differences. Individuals themselves vary slightly as a result of variable environmental constraints and day-length regimes. = Sexual dimorphism = Ringed kingfishers can be identified by sex due to differences in coloration. The males possess rusty-brown underparts with white undertail coverts and a white throat.

Habitat and distribution  = Habitat = Coiba Island, example of a preferred ringed kingfisher habitat Ringed kingfishers are seen in freshwater habitats, tropical and temperate marine shorelines as well as several islands, such as Coiba Island.Ridgely, R.S. and J. Gwynne (1989). A Guide to the Birds of Panama, with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras. 2nd ed. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press. Breeding occurs in aquatic regions with support of aquatic animals, including fish populated areas for nesting burrows. Nests can be found farther away from the waters.Bendire, C. (1895). \\"Life histories of North American birds, from the parrots to the grackles, with special reference to their breeding habits and eggs\\". U.S. Natl. Mus. Spec. Bull. no. 3. Habitats are near waterbodies that include streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, estuaries and marine habitats. Habitats with clear water and less vegetation are preferred to easily access its prey. = Distribution = Ringed kingfishers are found in broad areas between Texas, USA and South America. The ranges of ringed and belted kingfishers overlap from Central America and above for 6‚Äì8 months. Ringed kingfishers also have ranges that overlap with other kingfisher species in Central and South America. Breeding ranges of ringed kingfishers vary in the Neotropics in Mexico, the Caribbean and South America. Their preference for mangrove habitats has been observed in the tropics. Foraging occurs offshore as far as 1 km (.7 mi).Fry, C. H. and K. Fry (1992). Kingfishers, bee-eaters and rollers: A Handbook. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. Overwintering areas are indifferent to breeding ranges, but are able to forage farther than during their breeding periods. Large irrigation canals in Rio Grande, Texas have been used as wintering grounds by such species. They are usually found in areas with high fish densities during the dry season.  Behavior  = Locomotion = 212x212px The anatomy of ringed kingfisher's prevent efficient terrestrial movements. Individuals shuffle into and out of nesting burrows. Therefore, displacing between branches is difficult for this species. They possess strong wings that beat very slow as a result of its size. They are able to fly over land for long periods of time in comparison to other species of kingfishers.Ridgely, R.S. and P.J. Greenfield (2001). The birds of Ecuador, Vol. 2: Field guide. Ithaca, NY: Cornell Univ. Press. = Breeding =  Mating ritual  A mating ritual involves the male ringed kingfisher offering fish to the female before copulation. Richmond further explains that the pair perform where the male create calls while circling above the waters, while dropping into the water. This process last for a short period of time.Richmond, C.W. (1893). \\"Notes on a collection of Birds from Eastern Nicaragua and the Rio Frio, Costa Rica, with notes, and a description of a supposed new Trogon\\". P. U.S. Mus. no. XVI:479-532.  Parental behavior  Female and male ringed kingfishers incubate their eggs while performing other duties equally. Short foraging breaks are taken during late afternoon since incubation periods are long. Each individual take turns during the morning. Incubating birds are capable of finding prey by regurgitating its undigested food to attract flies in its burrow. = Vocalization = 262x262px Ringed kingfishers have louder and lower-pitched calls compared to belted kingfisher.Howell, S. N. G. and S. Webb (1995). A guide to the birds of Mexico and northern Central America. New York: Oxford University Press. Captured Juveniles have been heard to scream, giving a klek or kek call. The same call is heard during human intervention or other disturbances. A softer klek is produced by the adult to signal its incubating partner. Its common vocalizations are described as rattles. = Foraging behavior = Ringed kingfishers can perch for several hours on trees while watching for prey in the freshwater. Belted kingfishers perch for only a few moments. Ringed kingfishers have also been observed to forage in marine water. They catch their prey by diving from a perch. 226x226px  Diet  Ringed kingfisher's diet is largely dependent on fish, while sometimes targeting invertebrates, crabs and crustaceans.Jackson, D. (2006). \\"Aegla Leach (Crustacea: Decapoda) in the diet of the ringed kingfisher, Ceryle torquata (Linn√©) (Alcedinidae)\\". Bolet√≠n Chileno de Ornitolog√≠a. no. 12:26-27. Fish consumed include several species from the families Characidae and Cichlidae.Willard, D.E. (1985). \\"Comparative feeding ecology of twenty-two tropical piscivores\\". Ornithol. Monog. no. 36.  Threats  = Diseases = A study has examined a parasitic infection caused by Pulchrosopa pulchrosopa, a type of parasitic flatworm, that causes internal damages in the respiratory system of ringed kingfishers. The four infected individuals were examined and found the species in their lungs, trachea and coelomic cavity. The parasite migrates to the lungs as the host experiences stressful or immunosuppressive periods. The parasite causes significant damage to tissues due to its migration to the lungs.Merino, S. Javier Mart√≠nez, J. Alc√°ntara, G. and Navarro, M. (2003). Pulchrosopa pulchrosoma (Trematoda: Cathaemasiidae) in Ringed kingfishers (Megaceryle torquata torquata) from Iquitos, Peru: with inferences on life-cycle features. Avian Pathology. 32(4):351-354. = Predation = Predators of ringed kingfishers include the white-tailed hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, bald eagle, golden eagle and peregrine falcon.  Conservation Status  The IUCN considers the ringed kingfisher to be of ‚ÄúLeast Concern‚Äù. Increasing population trends indicate that the species are not vulnerable as they are widespread and have a large habitat distribution and breeding ranges.

His father Joseph was co-founder in 1868 of Johnston, Allen & Co. linen manufacturers. After his father died in 1890, Allen inherited the partnership. This lasted until 1905, when it was dissolved (the factory retained the name Johnston Allen) as Allen left to set up his own linen business, the Windsor factory.  Military career  He served as Sovereign Grand Master of the Royal Black Institution (RBI) in recognition for his efforts towards the purchase of Brownlow House which became the world headquarters for the institution. An illuminated address was presented to him by his District Lodge which still hangs in the dining room of Brownlow House beside his portrait, painted by Frank McKelvey. Allen, together with Hugh Hayes, John Mehaffey, George Lunn Junior and James Malcolm Junior, were named as its first trustees. The House was a venue for the signing of the Ulster Covenant, a cause Allen promoted vigorously, against what he viewed as the imposition by the British Government of the Third Home Rule Bill. Brownlow House also subsequently became his military HQ from 14 November 1914 onwards, where Allen helped raise and organise the basic training of the 16th (Pioneer) Battalion Royal Irish Rifles. He later served as its commanding officer. He arrived with them at Boulogne in Northern France from their training camp in Seaford, East Sussex on 1 October 1915.http://www.1914-1918.net/ririfles.htm He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1918 and mentioned in despatches four times. He was also appointed chevalier of the Legion of Honour.  Political career  From 1913 to 1914 Allen was a key supporter of Lord Edward Carson of Duncairn and Sir James Craig in their campaign against the third Home Rule Bill. He was also elected Deputy Grand Master of the Orange Order and also held the post of Honorary Secretary of the Ulster Unionist Council from 1907 on. He was elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom at a by-election in 1917, as an Irish Unionist Party Member of Parliament (MP) for North Armagh, and retained his seat at the 1918 general election. The constituency was abolished for the 1922 general election, when he was re-elected as a member of the new Ulster Unionist Party for the new Armagh constituency. On 22 June 1921, he was one of several officers invested as Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) to mark the visit of King George V and Queen Mary of Teck to officially open the new Parliament of Northern Ireland.  Personal life  Allen was twice married, first in 1892 to Maria (eldest daughter of Mr and Mrs John Ross). They had a son and daughter. Maria died in 1937 and in 1938 he was remarried, to Lillah Irene, daughter of the late R.H. Forsythe. Allen died in 1947, two weeks after being knocked down by a motor van while alighting from a tram on the Lisburn Road, Belfast, on 5 December. He was 81 and the second oldest MP in the House of Commons. Allen was buried in Lurgan and was survived by his second wife Lillah Irene, Lady Allen.

In this system, adult and able males, called paiks were obligated to render service to the state and form its militia in return for a piece of land for cultivation owned by the kingdom‚Äîbelieved to be a legacy the Ahoms brought with them from South-Eastern Asia in 1228.\\"It follows, then, that paddy lands belonged to the community, i.e. to the king as representative of the community. This medieval Thai practice is a key to the understanding of the Ahom system of land rights in Assam.\\" But it wasn't the Ahom kingdom alone that used a corvee system like this in Northeast India‚ÄîKingdom of Manipur and in a simpler form Jaintia kingdom and the Kachari kingdom too used similar systems that had tribal origins.\\"Despite some later modifications, the military-administrative system of the Ahoms remained essentially the same till 1826 and thus betrayed its tribal origin. It resembled very much that of medieval Thailand and also that of Manipur, Cachar and Jaintia.\\" The mature structure was designed by Momai Tamuli Borbarua in 1608, and extensively and exhaustively implemented by 1658 during the reign of Sutamla Jayadhwaj Singha. The system continued to evolve over time to meet the needs of the Ahom state and in time began to accumulate contradictions. By the end of the Moamoria rebellion (1769‚Äì1805) the Paik system had collapsed. The Paik system has had a profound impact on Assam's social life, with many collective practices originating in the medieval times. Many people in Assam today still carry the Paik offices titles in their last names‚ÄîBora, Saikia and Hazarika. Paik system Every male in the Ahom kingdom between the ages of sixteen and fifty who was not a noble, a priest, a high caste or a slave was a paik. The paiks were organized into four-member groups called gots. Each got had to send one member by rotation for public works. During the absence of a paik the other members of the got took care of his lands and family. In times of war, the paiks formed the militia. All lands under rice cultivation belonged to the state. Originally, the paiks were organized into phoids (clans), but by the 17th century the paiks were re- grouped into divisions called khels. According to Guha (1991), about 90% of the population belonged to this class at the time of Rudra Singha, around 1714. The top landed aristocracy was about 1% and the rest constituted the servile class. =Land holdings= The duty of a paik was to render service to the Ahom state in exchange for which he was granted 2 puras (2.66 acres) of usufruct cultivable land (gaa mati), which was neither hereditary nor transferable. In addition he could maintain his tax-free ancestral homestead and garden (basti and bari respectively). The nobility maintained personal estates called khats. Cultivable land called roopeet was held communally that was distributed among the paiks (called gaa mati). Wastelands reclaimed by paiks or non-paiks not covered by a royal grant are subject to inclusion in the roopeet category to be distributed as gaa mati in the next paik survey. Surplus cultivable land was distributed as ubar mati among the paiks. =Royal service= The royal services that the paiks tended to were defense (the Ahom kingdom did not have a standing army till the beginning of 19th century and its army consisted of the militia formed of paiks), civil construction (embankments, roads, bridges, tanks, etc.), military production (boats, arrows, muskets), etc. There were two major classes of paiks: kanri paik (archer) who rendered his service as a soldier or as a laborer and chamua paik who rendered non-manual service and had a higher social standing. Some other minor classes were: bilatiyas (tenants at the estates of nobles), dewaliyas (attached to temples and sattras) and bahatiyas (attached to hill masters). Kanri paiks could move up to chamua. Most of the lower paik officers--Bora, Saikia, Hazarika, Tamuli, Pachani--belonged to the chamua class. After the first major survey recorded in the Buranjis which was taken in 1510 under Suhungmung, the paiks were organized according to families and lineage called phoids and resettled according to their skills. The number of paiks rendering royal service at any time followed the principle of ghar muri e-powa or one- fourth the number of paiks in a household. The paik rendering service was rotated and the other paiks in his household tended to his gaa mati during his absence. In the 1609 restructuring by Momai Tamuli Borbarua the phoid organization was replaced by the got. A got consisted of four paiks who lived close together. The paiks in a got were numbered mul (first), duwal (second), tewal (third), etc. In times of peace, generally one of the paiks in a got rendered royal service at any given time. In times of war, a second or even a third paik from a got could be asked to render service simultaneously. As before, the gaa mati was tended to by the remaining paiks of the got. This ensured that economic production did not suffer when a large section of the population was not involved in it and contributed to the resilience of the Ahom kingdom in the 16th to 18th century. During the time of Rajeswar Singha (1752‚Äì1789), as the pressure on the paik system increased, the number of paiks in each got was decreased from four to three. =Organization of the paiks= The paiks in their phoids were organized under khels according to the locality in which they belonged. Momai Tamuli Borbarua reorganized many such khels functionally according to the specific service the paiks in the khel rendered. Some of the khels were thus similar to professional or trade guilds. The organization of the khel was extended later by his son Lachit Borphukan into self contained ones by incorporating paiks of different professions into each khel. Khels were further organized under a mel or a dagi. A group of such divisions was attached to each of the three great Gohains, which is then called the hatimur of the particular Gohain. A second group of divisions was placed under the khel officers (Phukan, Rajkhowa and Barua) that rendered service to members of the royal family. The third and the largest group of dagis, organized under khel officers, rendered service to the king or the state. =Paik officials= The paiks in a khel were organized under a gradation of officials who commanded a set number of them. They were Bora (20 paiks), Saikia (100) and Hazarika (1000). More important khels were commanded by a Phukan (6000), a Rajkhowa (a governor of a territory), or a Barua (a superintending officer) each of whom could command between 2000 and 3000 paiks. The Phukans, Rajkhowas, Baruas and Hazarikas were nominated by the king and appointed in concurrence with the three great Gohains (Burhagohain, Borgohain and Borpatrogohain). The Boras and Saikias were appointed by their respective Phukans and Rajkhowas. The paiks had the right to reject a Bora or a Saikia and request another officer of their choice. Kanri paiks could rise to become chamua paiks and then to higher paik officials. Appointments were made irrespective of the paiks religion or ethnicity. =Ahom justice= The Ahom justice system was also based on the Paik system. Each Paik official offered justice to the paiks and each appeal was heard by the next higher officer in the khel system. The system of appeals could go right up to the Nyayxodha Phukan. Challenges to the Paik system The Paik system was a method by which the Ahom king obtained service from the people and also provided service back to the people. By the 17th century it had evolved into a robust system that gave the Ahom kingdom a resilience in the face of a long protracted war against the Mughals. But soon it met challenges. Over time, the nobles began to appropriate the services of kanri paik, who as a likchou began to work for these high officials instead of the king. After the end of Ahom- Mughal conflicts, the Ahom kingdom extended the Paik system to the regions earlier held by the Mughals but where the royal service was now payable in cash, following the pargana system that was left behind. The increased production of paiks and the growth of an internal market over time in the entire kingdom demanded a monetization of the economy, which the Paik system was unable to handle. This gave rise to the apaikan chamua a class of paiks who were released from their khels and who paid a cash tax in lieu of the service to the king. The satras too attracted paiks who wanted to escape the compulsory service. The satras, in addition, came into competition with the Ahom kingdom by expanding into new social groups that the Ahom kingdom would have expanded into otherwise and providing an alternative economic production process. This conflict with the satras led to the Moamoria rebellion which further weakened the Ahom kingdom.

A cause for her canonization is open but has not advanced since the 17th century. Early life She was born Anna Caterina Gonzaga in Mantua on 16 November 1566 to Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, and to his wife, Eleonora of Austria, one of their three children. Her godfather was Philip II of Spain. Despite their noble standing, Anna Catherina was raised in a pious Catholic household, and Eleanor was particularly fond of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Legend has it that as an infant, Anna would be given a rosary by her parents to quiet her down. At about age 5, Anna Caterina became severely ill and nearly died. She contracted a high fever and her extremities began to swell. For two years she was ill. Finally her parents appealed to the Virgin Mary with deep prayer, promising to raise Anne as a child of Mary if she lived on. Soon Anne became healthy again. Anne's parents told her of the Virgin Mary's intervention on her behalf and the promise they had made. From there out Eleanor educated and guided Anne Catherine in the cultivation of devotion to Mary. Throughout childhood Anne Catherine displayed a consistent sense of piety. At age 9, Anna Caterina was reported to have received a vision of the Virgin Mary. One evening her room became immersed in a bright light and Mary appeared and spoke to her. While she recognized the woman before her as Mary, she was unable to understand what was she was told. It would only be years later that she understood the message. This vision doubled her long-standing desire to become a nun. Unexpected marriage In 1580, Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, lost his wife, Philippine. She was of the Welser family, who were not royalty, or even of noble birth. Even though the couple had two sons together, neither of them was eligible to succeed Ferdinand as archduke. This prodded Ferdinand to seek remarriage. Ferdinand's sister, Madeleine, suggested he consider marrying her niece Anna Caterina. On 1 January 1582 Ferdinand asked Duke William for her hand in marriage, to which William consented. Though she realized this would postpone her calling to a religious order, Anna respected her parent's wishes and voiced no objection to the marriage. Before leaving Mantua for Innsbruck, in Austria, Anna Caterina asked that her father fulfill some requests. First was a request to release 15 prisoners in celebration of her departure. Second was a request to donate moneys to 15 beggars. Third was a request to provide interior furnishings at 15 churches. William agreed to each request. Growing family On 14 May 1582, at age 15, Anna Caterina was married to Ferdinand in Innsbruck and became Archduchess of Austria. In their first three years of marriage Anna gave birth to three daughters ‚Äî Eleanor (b. 1583), Marie (b. 1584), and Anna (b. 1585 - 1618). Eleanor died in her infancy; Anna would go on to marry Matthias, King of Hungary and Bohemia, later Holy Roman Emperor. While Ferdinand loved his daughters, he wished for a son to succeed him. He soon realized this should never come to pass and gave way to fits of anger over the dilemma. Eventually Ferdinand would come to accept the situation and return to reason. As a way of rectifying his years of resentment and temper, he gave his wife the Chateau of Wohlgemutheium and the Fortress of Thaur. In turn, Anne was a dutiful wife who cared for Ferdinand throughout several illnesses. Ferdinand died in 1595. Widowhood Aside from her considerable grief, Anna was now responsible for the Innsbruck palace, filled with a great deal of servants and two young daughters. But Anne took this time to redouble her devotion to God and Mary. With Ferdinand, Anna would often wear a royal crown and fine jewelry in order to satisfy him. However, following his death, she retired her crown for a black veil and wore a rosary around her neck. Despite her enormous wealth, Anne‚Äôs goal was to completely do away with worldly pleasures. In her palace Anne lived in small quarters adjacent to a large chapel she had built since Ferdinand‚Äôs death, the door connecting the two via a secret hallway. Her room was quite simple, the bed made of very hard wood with one thin sheet to cover with. She abdicated primary care of her two daughters to the Baroness of Brandes. The atmosphere at the palace took on the feel of a religious cloister, where the hub of everyone‚Äôs universe revolved around religious piety and devotion. Anna was, in her own way, now carrying out a semi-monastic lifestyle which she had long desired. She would fast every Friday, permitting her health could withstand it. Anna came to realize that she should allot her considerable wealth to others, and so she gave large sums to the Church for the poor, keeping some for her own family. She began to feed the poor at her palace and would serve them personally. Anna also made many visits to the sick and dying, always with her daughters, to administer medicines and to care for them. She was known to give alms everywhere she went, turning nobody in need away. She donated especially large sums to religious institutions in the Innsbruck and Mantua areas, often heralded as an informal mother to the needy for her generosity. =Visions of Mary= Anna Juliana Gonzaga as a Servite Sister Through the years Anne reportedly had a number of visions from the Virgin Mary. In 1606, on the Feast of the Annunciation and in her chapel in prayer, Anne purportedly received another such visit from Mary instructing her to build a convent there in Innsbruck for the Servants of Mary, Religious Sisters of the Servite Third Order founded by St. Juliana Falconieri in the 14th century, of which she was to be a member. With the blessing of Pope Paul V, Anna proceeded with building. Through prayer Anna received further instruction to build her convent on the grounds of her garden; the first stone was placed on the Feast of the Visitation in 1606. On 2 July 1607 Anna had the Bishop of Brixen (Christoph IV von Spaur), and her stepson, Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria and Margrave of Burgau, be present for the laying down of the cornerstone. Despite this ceremonial start, many influential people in the region were opposed to the construction. Many personal advisors felt it would deplete the palace's resources. The stresses related to this unforeseen opposition culminated in a dire illness for Anne. Her body became covered in sores and she became bedridden, her doctors fearing for the worst. Following a personal Mass held for her in her room Anna Caterina allegedly had another vision in which the Virgin Mary appeared, assuring her protection. Anne got out of bed immediately and was completely cured of her ailment, vowing to accomplish the project no matter the odds. One day, during construction, a landslide occurred as laborers were working onsite, burying one worker. After considerable time had passed, the others located his body and were astonished to find he was not even hurt. This incident quieted much of the opposition to the building of the convent, seen by many as a miracle. The story goes that the project would surely bankrupt Anna, but miraculously the money was always there no matter the expense. Religious life and veneration Upon the completion of the convent, Anna entered the community and took the Servite religious habit, along with the name Anna Juliana, in honor of the foundress of the Order. It was there that she died in 1621. Immediately after her death, devotion to Anna as a saint began to grow. In 1693 a process for her canonization was opened by the current Bishop of Brixen, Count Johann Franz von Khuen zu Liechtenberg,. The cause, however, has never advanced.

This episode is also known as \\"Scouting Adventures\\" and \\"Boy Scouts\\". Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. Plot Graeme and Bill are curious -- Tim has been acting in a suspicious manner. They decide to follow Tim, and find that he is a scout, with the name \\"Brown Owl\\". Bill and Graeme are jealous of him -- they want to be scouts, too. So Tim allows them to join -- however, their behaviour is so bad because of their merely boyish planks that they are quickly drummed out of the Scouts by Tim. On the outer, Graeme and Bill become bad masked scouts (the \\"Lone Scout, plus One\\"), who create havoc with their own special brand of 'Bob A Job', where they demand money, or they will do a job (they demand ¬£500 from Tim, and then ¬£1000 from other people). They also cause problems for people as they work towards getting their 'Wig-spotters Badge' and 'World Domination Badge'. Graeme comments to Bill that there are only three people who had ever received the \\"World Domination Badge\\" -- Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar and David Frost (although Graeme says Frost had actually pinched his badge). The actions of Bill and Graeme result in the Scouts becoming an illegal organisation, and Tim and the other scouts are forced to hide their scouting membership from the Scoutfinder General. The Scoutfinder General decides to trick Tim into revealing that he is a scout, by saying: \\"Dyb, Dyb, Dyb\\" with Tim then joining in with: \\"Dob, D-shhhhhhhhhh!\\" The Scoutfinder General asked sharply: \\"WHAT WAS THAT?!\\" to which Tim replied nervously: \\"N-nothing.\\" Accusingly, the Scoutfinder General said: \\"You said dob!\\" to which Tim replied, speaking very quickly: \\"only one though, one dob, not three dobs.\\" Tim continues to deny that he is a scout, so the Scoutfinder General drums his fingers on his desk, and Tim and his scout group cannot help themselves -- they burst into a scouting song (\\"On The Crest Of A Wave\\"). The Scoutfinder General looks smug and triumphant at his success, and Tim and his scout group are then convicted of being scouts. Deprived of the scouts, Tim joins the Salvation Army (in which he is the only man -- appearing as both a Sergeant and Field Marshal). Tim battles the mysterious masked bad scouts with the help of his all-women troops from the Salvation Army, as well as the all-women troops from the Salvation Navy and the all-women troops from the Salvation Air force.

Since 2004, he has been president of the firm Advancing Strategies LLC. He was formerly with Crosslink Strategy, a conservative lobbying and political consulting firm founded by former John McCain advisor Terry Nelson, a founding partner of FP1 as well. LaCivita is often mentioned for his role as media advisor to the Swift Boat Veterans, an independent-expenditure group credited with a significant impact on the 2004 presidential election. On August 31, 2020, LaCivita was announced as head of Preserve America, a new pro-Trump superPAC that began a $30-million advertising blitz in early September, focusing initially on the swing states of Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Iowa and Georgia. https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/31/swift-boat-mastermind-super-pac- trump-405519 Early life LaCivita was born in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, but grew up in the Richmond, Virginia area, graduating from Midlothian High School. He received his bachelor's degree in political science from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1989.April 2002, Campaigns & Elections, \\"Rising Political Stars of 2002\\". He joined the US Marine Corps, was awarded a Purple Heart for wounds received while serving in the Persian Gulf War in 1991, and discharged a Sergeant. Afterwards, he taught part-time at Regent University and began a new career as a political consultant. Political career Active in Republican politics following his Gulf War service, LaCivita did field work for George F. Allen in central Virginia during his 1991 congressional campaign, then went with him to Capitol Hill, serving as a legislative assistant on foreign and defense policy. When Allen ran for Governor of Virginia in 1993, LaCivita organized in the Richmond area, Southside and central Virginia, then was appointed to serve as an assistant secretary of administration.June 3, 1999, Associated Press \\"GOP director to manage Allen's campaign\\". He left state service in 1995 to help run Allen's political action committee, assisting legislative races that year (wherein the GOP captured a tie in the State Senate). LaCivita was named executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia in 1996, after Allen's allies won control of the RPV. LaCivita ran the party as James S. Gilmore succeeded Allen as governor in 1997, acting as overseer of internal partisan squabbles, but going on later to capture control of both houses of the General Assembly in 1999. By then, LaCivita, and former gubernatorial chief of staff Jay Timmons, were guiding Allen's campaign for U.S. Senate, ultimately defeating two-term Democratic incumbent Chuck Robb with 52% in a hard-fought contest in November 2000. In the fall of 2001, LaCivita was drafted in the final two months to shore up the losing campaign of Attorney General Mark Earley for governor against Mark Warner. As Fred Barnes wrote, \\"Earley wasted the summer and didn't find a message until September -- after party officials dispatched Chris LaCivita, the political director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, to run his campaign. The message, it turns out, is a hardy perennial for Republicans: taxes.\\" Earley, down by 13 points in mid-summer, closed the gap late in the campaignNovember 4, 2001, Washington Times, Stephen Dinan, \\"Earley camp optimistic after poll shows closer race\\". eventually lost by five points, 52%-47%, to the Democrat. During the 2002 midterm election cycle, LaCivita served the political director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Bill Frist. That November, the GOP scored a net gain of two Senate seats, recapturing control of the upper chamber. While at the NRSC, LaCivita was the direct supervisor of James Tobin, another former employee of the DCI Group. In 2005, Tobin was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison for his role in the 2002 NH phone jamming scandal for his activities during that campaign; LaCivita was on Tobin's witness list but never called. Democrats, who sought testimony from LaCivita for a civil suit tied to the same incident, recently settled that civil suit out of court. Tobin's conviction was overturned on appeal. In 2003, LaCivita served as president of Progress for America, later giving that role to former DCI employee Brian McCabe while LaCivita became its executive director. LaCivita at one time worked for the Republican political consulting firm DCI Group, which had close ties both to Progress for America and Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. During the 2004 US presidential campaign, LaCivita served as consultant and principal media advisor to the Swift Boat Veterans, writing and producing the group's memorable (and controversial) commercials in association with Rick Reed. At the same time, LaCivita consulted for the NRSC, now headed by former client George Allen, as it scored a net gain of four Senate seats in the November 2004 general elections. LaCivita continued his independent- expenditure work in 2005, producing ads in support of GOP Attorney General Jerry Kilgore in his unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Virginia. In 2005 and 2006, LaCivita was senior strategist for Vern Buchanan, who won a hotly contested Republican primary, then the general election in Florida's 13th congressional district by less than 400 votes. LaCivita also ran an independent organization (Floridians for a Better and Brighter Future) during that state's gubernatorial primary election in 2005‚Äì06, whose target was former Insurance Commissioner Tom Gallagher. LaCivita's favored candidate, Charlie Crist, won the party's nomination, and was subsequently elected Florida's governor. LaCivita also served as general consultant to businessman Bob Corker's successful primary and general-election campaigns for the U.S. Senate from Tennessee, succeeding his former boss Bill Frist. These successes were offset by the narrow defeat that November of George Allen for re-election in LaCivita's home state of Virginia by Democrat Jim Webb, by 9,329 votes. Interviewed in March, 2007, LaCivita told reporters that the GOP could silence the press uproar over the sudden dismissal of eight US Attorneys by promoting stories about the most extreme among anti-Bush activists. \\"When are we going to make it about Code Pink and the rest of the liberal weirdos controlling the Democrat agenda?\\" he asked. That fall, he guided Jill Holtzman Vogel to her initial victory in the Winchester-based Virginia State Senate contest. During the 2008 presidential campaign, LaCivita and Tony Feather launched a new 501(c)4 issues advocacy group, the American Issues Project, after a series of meetings with other Swift Boat donors. In August 2008, AIP began airing ads in battleground states seeking to raise questions about Democratic Party presidential nominee Senator Barack Obama's ties to former student radical William Ayers. The ad may be viewed here. The American Issues Project had a sole donor, Harold Simmons, an 87-year-old Dallas billionaire who was also a principal donor, along with T. Boone Pickens, to the Swiftboat Veterans for Truth PAC. On October 10, 2008, a campaign finance watchdog group, Democracy 21, filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission about the group's alleged violations of election campaign law. This went nowhere, and in 2009 AIP aired a second national TV spot (colloquially called the \\"Jesus\\" ad) targeting the Obama stimulus package as unprecedented in its size and wastefulness. The ad may be viewed here. The spots were produced by Larry McCarthy under LaCivita's direction. In 2009, LaCivita was the general strategist for State Senator Ken Cuccinelli's successful bid for Attorney General of Virginia. He also guided Jeffrey McWaters to victory in a December special election for Virginia State Senate, occasioned by the departure of longtime incumbent Ken Stolle in Virginia Beach. In the summer of 2010, LaCivita returned to the NRSC as its Political Director, the same post he held in 2002.http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/campaigns-dont- coordinate-really/?hp \\"Campaigns Don't Coordinate. Really.\\" The New York Times, October 20, 2010. Under his direction, the GOP scored a net gain of five Senate seats in the November 2010 general elections. Throughout 2010, LaCivita consulted for several GOP congressional campaigns, most prominently that of State Senator Robert Hurt who was elected in Virginia's 5th Congressional District over Democratic incumbent Tom Perriello. He also aided businessman Scott Rigell in his successful bid for election in Virginia's 2nd Congressional District over incumbent Glenn Nye.http://bearingdrift.com/2010/03/01/chris-lacivita-joins-scott-rigell- campaign/ But his client in Missouri's 3rd congressional district, Ed Martin, fell short in his bid to unseat Democratic Rep. Russ Carnahan. In 2011, Virginia Republicans succeeded in ousting two Democratic State Senators, gaining a 20‚Äì20 tie (and an effective majority with GOP Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling acting in their favor). LaCivita was the strategist for Bill Stanley,http://thebullelephant.com/decision-time-chairman-bill-stanley-fifth- district/ who defeated longtime Democrat incumbent Roscoe Reynolds in a race between two Southwest Virginia senators thrown together by redistricting. Stanley prevailed by a margin of 644 votes, 46.80% to 45.54%. LaCivita helmed the 2012 Senatorial campaign of Linda McMahon in Connecticut, losing to Congressman Chris Murphy.https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/nyregion/linda-e- mcmahon-has-spent-nearly-100-million-in-senate-races.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 At the same time, he guided Robert Hurt to his first re-election in Virginia's 5th Congressional District, defeating challenger John Douglass by 12 points.http://www.sbe.virginia.gov/cms/Index.html Virginia State Board of Elections He also was consultant to black conservative Congressman Allen West of Florida,http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82498.html who was defeated for re-election in a heavily redistricted seat.https://www.npr.org/2012/10/31/164055678/allen-west-faces-challenge- after-redistricting LaCivita was the chief strategist for the 2013 gubernatorial campaign of longtime client Ken Cuccinelli in Virginia.http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/ken-cuccinelli-virginia- governor-race-98548.html The conservative Attorney General, heavily outspent and behind in every public survey from July to November, battled to a surprisingly close finishhttp://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/terry- mcauliffe-virginia-governor-2013-elections-99441_Page2.html against former Democratic Party chair Terry McAuliffe, losing 45.2% to 47.7%, a margin of 56,000 votes of 2.2 million cast. Afterwards, LaCivita blamed the October 2013 government shutdown for slowing Cuccinelli's momentum in the final weeks, while praising the support received from the Republican National Committee and the Republican Governors Association.http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/363424/top-cuccinelli-aide- blames-shutdown-defeat-robert-costa In September 2014, Senate Republicans tapped LaCivita and his ally, Corry Bliss, to rescue the faltering campaign of incumbent Pat Roberts in Kansas, facing a serious challenge from Independent candidate Greg Orman (following the withdrawal of the Democratic nominee, in what was heretofore a three-way general-election contest).http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/pat-roberts- kansas-2014-election-110822.html Roberts, behind or even with Orman in nearly all opinion polls that fall, won re-election with a surprisingly strong 53.1% to Orman's 42.5%. However, LaCivita's House candidate in Northern California, Doug Ose, fell just short of victory after a protracted count, losing by 1,400 votes to incumbent Ami Bera. In January 2015, LaCivita was named a senior adviser to the exploratory presidential campaign of Senator Rand Paul.https://www.wsj.com/articles/rand-paul-taps-veteran-adviser-for- likely-2016-campaign-1421060641 Paul suspended his campaign in February 2016, after finishing in fifth place out of 12 Republican candidates at the Iowa caucuses. In April 2016, the Republican National Committee hired LaCivita as a senior adviser for what was expected to be a fractious National Convention in Cleveland.RNC press release, April 7, 2016, accessed thru https://gop.com/rnc- launches-grassroots-assistance-project/? His longtime former Virginia client, Ken Cuccinelli, plotted a floor challenge to disrupt Donald Trump's path to the nomination. Working for RNC Chair Reince Priebus, LaCivita and others were instrumental in shutting down the \\"Never Trump\\" movement's floor challenge on the first day of the Convention. According to Kyle Cheney of Politico, \\"The RNC and Trump campaign whips [went] to work. With the lists of insurgent delegates in hand, dozens of aides worked the convention floor for about 15 minutes, collecting their own set of withdrawal signatures. In the end, four of the initial 11 states saw enough delegates abandon the roll call effort to scuttle it.\\" That November and December, LaCivita served as a national GOP liaison to Republicans named to the Electoral College. LaCivita was Pat McCrory's strategist in his unsuccessful 2016 campaign for reelection as Governor of North Carolina. McCrory, outspent 2-to-1, lost by just 10,000 votes, 48.8% to 49.0% (confirmed only after a recount) to Democrat Roy Cooper.Cook, Rhodes, America Votes 32, Sage Publishing, 2017. In 2017, LaCivita was hired as general consultant to the Kim Guadagno campaign for governor in New Jersey shortly before her victory in the Republican primary. Guadagno was defeated in the fall, part of the Democratic sweep in the Garden State.https://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/10/can_kim_guadagno_use_property_taxes_to_become_njs.html Throughout 2017 and 2018, LaCivita served as a consultant to the American Action Network and Congressional Leadership Fund, the SuperPAC allied with GOP Speaker Paul Ryan, reuniting with longtime campaign partner Corry Bliss. In that capacity, he captained several Independent Expenditure campaigns in House races, including GOP victories for Will Hurd (Texas's 23rd Congressional District) and Andy Barr (Kentucky 6th Congressional). He was also General Consultant to Anthony Gonzalez, the former NFL wide receiver and Stanford graduate who won the Republican nomination and was elected Congressman from Ohio's 16th Congressional District. In 2018, LaCivita returned to the Nutmeg State advised Republican businessman and academic Bob Stefanowski in his insurgent campaign for governor of Connecticut. First-time candidate Stefanowski triumphed unexpectedly, skipping the state GOP convention and qualifying for the primary by petition (first candidate in state history to do so). Stefanowski won the nomination in the contested five-way primary.Hartford Courant, August 22, 2018, \\"Stefanowski Hosts GOP Brass\\" Running close in polls throughout the fall despite the anti-Trump tide in a Democratic state,https://www.sacredheart.edu/media/sacredheart/instituteforpublicpolicy/GreatBlue ---Sacred-Heart-University-Gubernatorial-Race-Poll-(November-2018).pdf Stefanowski was defeated 46.2% to Ned Lamont's 49.4%. Even in losing, Stefanowski achieved the second-highest vote for Governor (650,138) of any candidate in Connecticut history (Jodi Rell's 710,048 ballots in 2006 being the record), exclusive of Lamont. LaCivita joined FP1 in January 2019. Personal life LaCivita lives outside Richmond with his wife, Catherine, and their two children.

The screenplay was co-written by F. Paul Benz and Steve Tomlin. The leading cast includes Val Kilmer, Neve Campbell, Sam Shepard, Amy Smart and Faye Dunaway. Plot The film begins in the outskirts of rural New Mexico where an unconscious Frank Kavanaugh (Kilmer) is discovered by two local ranch hands. Suffering from a gunshot wound to the head, he is rushed to a nearby hospital in a small town called Black Point. Due to the extent of his injuries, Kavanaugh is placed in an intensive care unit under the care of a trauma nurse named Liz (Amy Smart). After regaining consciousness, Kavanaugh is interviewed by Sheriff Kolb (Shepard), however, because of his head injuries, he is unable to explain what has transpired due to a case of temporary amnesia. Given his condition, Kavanaugh is ordered to stay in the hospital for closer observation. Much to their dismay, Sheriff Kolb and his deputies are unable to find any clues as to what might have happened to Kavanaugh. After a thorough search of the crime scene, Sheriff Kolb returns to the hospital to find that Kavanaugh, in a violent and confused state, is claiming to have knowledge of a possible assassination attempt on the president of the United States. Dr. Conway (Gil Bellows) persuades Kavanaugh to remain calm and later explains to Sheriff Kolb that his paranoia stems from a delusional side effect of the amnesia. Amongst the added confusion, Kavanaugh experiences a myriad of images that could be pure fantasy or actual pre-amnesiatic memories. The most vivid image, one in which a dark, shadowy figure is seen talking with a mysterious woman named Ms. K (Dunaway), hints at various details of a possible assassination attempt involving key government parties. However, because of Kavanaugh's deranged state, he is unable to differentiate between reality and fantasy. Sheriff Kolb believes that there is some credibility to Kavanaugh's story and continues to question him. To further complicate matters for Kavanaugh, his fianc√©e, Chloe (Campbell), arrives at the hospital and makes arrangements for his immediate release. It is then revealed through Chloe that she and Kavanaugh are actually from Chicago and that Kavanaugh works for the IRS. She produces documentation that verifies Kavanaugh's employment with the government, and further explains to Sheriff Kolb that she and Kavanaugh were in New Mexico on vacation. She also produces a seaside photo of Kavanaugh and herself walking on a beach as further proof that she is his fianc√©e. Kavanaugh still strongly believes in an imminent attempt on the President's life and later calls the US Secret Service and warns them of an assassination plot that will occur in Black Point within the next few days. Distraught over his situation, Chloe convinces Kavanaugh to leave the hospital with her, and she drives him back to the motel they had checked into a few days earlier. Incidentally, recent news updates reveal that the President and his campaign team have been touring the Southwest and will arrive in New Mexico within the next few days. As the President arrives and prepares to address the public, Kavanaugh attempts to follow what evidence he has to warn the authorities and avert the assassination. While he views the President from a nearby building, he discovers a set of sniper's equipment, including a rifle, which he instinctively assembles. Taking aim out of the window, he sights the President through the scope of the rifle, and realizes that he, in fact, is the assassin, and that his flashbacks are of all the preparation leading up to the date of the event. He notices another assassin taking aim at the President with his sniper rifle from the other side. Understanding that he has the power to change the course of events, Kavanaugh aims at the other assassin through his scope and shoots him, killing him and averting the assassination.

It was used primarily in late Victorian architecture and during the early Arts and Crafts movement. History Westwood House, Worcestershire, was a 17-century precursor. After the original, rectangular house was begun c. 1612, four diagonal wings were added at some time later in the same century. Victorian interest in the plan originated in the 1891 remodelling of Chesters, Northumberland, by Norman Shaw. To the original, square house of 1771 he added five wings; three of these were diagonal, creating suntrap flanks for the south and west fronts. The principle of the butterfly plan was also re-adapted within an overall rectangular overall form, as for instance in Kallio Library in Helsinki, Finland, by architect Karl H√•rd af Segerstad, completed in 1902.

The band The three members of the band are Graham McKee (lead vocals/bass guitar) as Vince, Luke O'Reilly (lead guitar/vocals) as Leon and Eoin Logan (drums/vocals) as Tay. Their sound is similar to that of acts such as The Monkees, McFly and Led Zeppelin. They came together in the early part of 2006 to begin work on their debut album People Let's Go, and to film the first part of their television series. They have been signed to Universal Music and the album was released in April 2007. An exclusive download only release of \\"Can't Go There Again\\" was made available on 3 November 2007. They performed around in Primary Schools, culminating in a main-stage performance at the 21st World Scout Jamboree. This was the height of the band's success and they went their separate ways in 2007, however their fans hope for a reunion. The media has quashed speculation so far, however in late 2011 the youthful-looking Eoin Logan (who was 28 when filming for the show began) was quoted as saying \\"I would welcome a return to the band and would love to reprise my role of Tay again. I feel that the character still has a lot of potential and I have a few ideas on how I would like to develop him. A part of me will always be Tay\\". Eoin is now completing a History and Theatre Studies degree at the University of Glasgow. The programme Bel's Boys was made by Initial (part of the Endemol group) and was part funded by the NIFTC (Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission). The series was filmed entirely in Belfast. On the CITV television programme Graham as Vince, Luke as Leon and Eoin as Tay play the star rolls in the television series. The show follows the progress of the band as they try to reach the top.

Odum Institute, 2nd floor of Davis Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Howard Washington Odum (May 24, 1884 ‚Äì November 8, 1954) was an American sociologist and author, publishing three novels in addition to 20 scholarly texts. Beginning in 1920, he served as a faculty member at the University of North Carolina, founding the university press, the journal Social Forces, and what is now the Howard W. Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, all in the 1920s. He also founded the university's School of Public Welfare, one of the first in the Southeast. With doctorates in psychology and sociology, he wrote extensively across academic disciplines, influencing several fields.George B. Tindall, \\"The significance of Howard W. Odum to Southern history: A preliminary estimate.\\" Journal of Southern History 24.3 (1958): 285-307. Biography =Early years and education= Born in 1884 in Bethlehem, Georgia, Howard W. Odum had parents, William Pleasants and Mary Ann (Thomas) Odum, who encouraged his pursuit of education. He attended local schools through high school. Odum graduated from Emory University. While working as a teacher, he collected material on black folk lore and songs for two dissertations while completing his master's at University of Mississippi. He received his first doctorate, in psychology, at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he studied with G. Stanley Hall. He received his second doctorate, in sociology, at Columbia University. While at Columbia, he studied with Franklin Henry Giddings, focusing on race. Both of his two dissertations on black studies were published: the first was on religious traits in folk songs, and the second was on black social life. =Published work= He was appointed to serve as Assistant Director of Research for President Herbert Hoover's Research Committee on Social Trends, beginning in 1933. He wrote three novels in addition to more than 20 scholarly texts, was President of the American Sociological Association in 1930, and was also a founding member of the Southern Regional Council. Odum was known for collecting extensive facts, ranging from oral history (including documentation of folk songs) to agricultural data. His publication Southern Regions of the United States (1936) pulled together a wide variety of facts and figures about the Southeast. This book, used by government administrators, farmers, scholars, and others, remains relevant today as a historical text. Odum's prolific contribution to the social sciences has been an influence on multiple disciplines, including ecology. Both of his sons, Eugene and Howard T. Odum, became internationally recognized scholars of zoologist and ecology. The Odum brothers frequently cited their father's holistic inquiry as an important influence in their own understanding of emergent properties and other ecological concepts. =Academia= Odum became a faculty member in the School of Public Welfare (a precursor of the School of Social Work) and Department of Sociology at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1920, founding the School of Public Welfare, one of the earliest such schools in the Southeast. He was a visionary in establishing the University of North Carolina Press. While at Chapel Hill, Odum also founded the journal Social Forces in 1922 and the H.W. Odum Institute for Research in Social Science in 1924. Odum was one of the most prolific academics who influenced the early development of the University of North Carolina; his vision and academic strengths attracted other scholars to campus. Odum hired and collaborated with the university's first female faculty member. His productivity was renowned, and his scholarship reached from academic settings to the community‚Äîincluding influences on race relations in the American South. His book Race and Rumors of Race (1943), exploring racial tensions in the South and rising activism among blacks, was an early documentation of the civil rights movement. Odum's views on race progressed over time and ultimately he was a leader, documenting folk life, hate crimes/lynchings, and the rich oral histories of African- American communities in the South. His work is difficult to classify under one discipline, although he identified most with sociology while being deeply committed to social welfare.Harvey A. Kantor, \\"Howard W. Odum: The implications of folk, planning, and regionalism.\\" American Journal of Sociology 79.2 (1973): 278-295. Marriage and family Odum married Anna Louise Kranz (1888‚Äì1965), also a student of Stanley Hall at Clark University. The couple had two sons, Eugene and Howard T. Odum, and a daughter, Mary Frances Odum. The men both became zoologists and recognized scholars of ecology, at University of Georgia and University of Florida, respectively. Mary Frances married Phillip Schinan and lives in Chapel Hill.

She was the name ship of the s. Apollo was launched in 1799, and wrecked with heavy loss of life in 1804. French Revolutionary Wars Apollo was built at Deptford Wharf in 1799, taking her name from the fifth-rate , which had been wrecked off Holland in January. She was commissioned in October under Captain Peter Halkett ‚Äî who had commanded the previous Apollo when she was lost ‚Äî and was posted to the West Indies, cruising there and escorting convoys to Britain.Winfield 2008, p. 155. While she was escorting a convoy on 11 January 1800 Apollo saw a suspicious vessel some distance away. After a four-hour chase she captured the Spanish warship Aquilla. Aquilla was pierced for 22 guns on the main deck but had only four mounted. She was under the command of Don Mariano Merino and was on a cargo voyage from Buenos Ayres to A Coru√±a. At the time, the sloop was in company with Apollo. At daybreak on 15 January, Apollo sighted a vessel that proceeded to attempt to evade closer scrutiny. After a short chase Apollo recaptured , which had been part of the convoy that Apollo was escorting, but which had gotten separated on 1 January at the onset of gale. On 13 January the French privateer ship , of 20 guns, had captured her. Apollo captured Cantabria (or C√°ntabro), of 18 guns, off Havana on 27 January. In at least one account the vessel is described as the \\"Cantabrian Spanish ship of 18 guns\\".Ralfe (1828), p. 334. Between 20 May and 19 September, Apollo captured two vessels: *Spanish warship of 18 guns and 110 men, with \\"a valuable cargo\\";This may well be the same vessel as Cantabbria captured on 27 January, given the vagaries of record keeping at the time. and a *Spanish xebec sailing from M√°laga to Vera Cruz. On 10 November, Apollo chased a xebec and then, coming up on a brig, chased and captured her. The brig was Resolution, a sloop of war, of 18 guns and 149 men, under the command of Don Francisco Darrichena. She was the former British navy cutter Resolution and had sailed from Vera Cruz three days earlier. After securing the prize, Apollo set out after the xebec, sighting her an hour after daybreak. Apollo finally captured the xebec Marte, of 75 tons, at three in the afternoon. She had been sailing from Vera Cruz for Havana. Apollo towed Resolution until 27 November, when she lost her mast. Resolution was in such an irreparable state Halkett destroyed her. Then on 7 December Apollo captured the schooner St Joseph, of 70 tons. In addition to these three vessels, between 3 August 1800 and 3 January 1801, Apollo captured two other Spanish merchant vessels: *brig Santa Trinidad, of 140 tons, carrying dry goods; *polacre V. Del Carmen, of 100 tons, carrying dry goods. On 18 February 1801, Apollo captured the French 14-gun privateer Vigilante. Head money for Aquilla, Cantabria and Vigilante was paid in August 1828. First-class shares were worth ¬£77 18s 3d (Aquilla), ¬£163 18s 5¬æd (Cantabria), and ¬£61 18s 6d (Vigilante); fifth-class shares, the shares of an able seaman, were worth 4s 8d, 9s 10¬Ωd and 4s 0¬Ωd. In mid-July 1801, Apollo picked up the crew of from Vera Cruz. Meleager had wrecked on the Triangles Shoals in the Bay of Campeche on 9 June but the crew had been able to take to the boats in time and sail to Vera Cruz.Hepper (1994), p. 98. Apollo returned to Portsmouth in March 1802, to be paid off after the Peace of Amiens. However, she was rushed into commission again in October of that year, for service on the Irish station under Captain John William Taylor Dixon. Napoleonic Wars On 21 June 1803, Apollo captured the French ship Bon Accord. Then on 29 June, Apollo captured the French navy brig Dart, which sailing from Martinique to Lorient. She was armed with four guns and had a 45-man crew. She and several other vessels had been carrying cargo to Martinique. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Dart. Fate On 26 March 1804, Apollo sailed from Cork with a convoy of sixty-seven merchantmen, accompanied by , immediately encountering a strong gale. At 3:30 in the morning of 2 April, Apollo unexpectedly ran aground when their calculations showed them well offshore.Hepper (1994), pp.104-5. In the morning Apollo discovered that she had run aground about nine miles south of Cape Mondego on the coast of Portugal. Twenty-five or six of the vessels in the convoy, traveling closely behind due to the low visibility and bad weather, were also wrecked. Next day some more vessels wrecked. In all, 29 vessels ran aground. All the boats of the frigate were destroyed, and it took two days to transfer Apollos crew to land. Sixty-two officers and men died;A list of the drowned was published in The Times of 2 May 1804. It included Captain Dixon, and one of his lieutenants. around twenty of the crew died in the first few hours, but most perished of exposure waiting to be rescued. The number of dead in the merchant vessels is not known, but the Naval Chronicle reported that \\"dead bodies were every day floating ashore, and pieces of wreck covered the beach upwards of ten miles.\\" Carysfort had shifted course on the evening of 1 April, and so escaped grounding. She gathered the 38 surviving vessels and proceeded with the convoy.The New annual register, or General repository of history, politics, and literature (1805), pp.54-5. Some of the survivors from Apollo had to walk 18 miles to Figuera. From there a schooner carried them to Lisbon. brought them back to Portsmouth.\\"Sunday and tuesday's Post\\", Jackson's Oxford Journal, 26 May 1804; Issue 2665. At the time, accounts blamed strong currents. Later it was discovered that Apollo had taken on board an iron tank, but that no one had adjusted her compass for the influence of this large magnetic mass. Consequently, a small error in direction accumulated over the course of the five days; at the time Apollo struck Dixon thought she was forty or so miles out to sea.The companion to the British almanac, for the year 1874, p. 53. London, 1875. Because the convoy had endured bad weather since leaving Cork, no one had taken sightings that would have enabled them to correct their estimates of their position. Instead, they had relied on an approximately known speed and a biased heading for their estimate. Notes References * *Hepper, David J. (1994) British Warship Losses in the Age of Sail, 1650-1859.

She grew up in Leusden and learned to play the guitar while backpacking through Australia, New Zealand, Asia and South Africa. There she wrote her first song 'Lizzy'. When she got back in the Netherlands she went to the stages, quickly winning the 'Studenten Songfestival in Maastricht (songfestival for students in Maastricht). Soon after she also won the Sky Radio Talentenjacht (Sky Radio Talenthunt), the demopoll by the Brussels Studio and the prestigious 'Grote Prijs van Nederland' 2003 (Grand Prix of the Netherlands) in the category singer-songwriter. After winning the Grote Prijs, she meets Henk Jan Heuvelink. He plays the wurlitzer, harmonium and the piano. Together they regularly play at festivals, in theaters and on the radio. In 2008 drummer Nicky Hustinx joins the band. The Beauty Around (2006) In the summer of 2005, Marike records her first album The Beauty Around. It was released on 15 May 2006, on her own record label, Morning Coffee Records. It is distributed by V2Records. The debut lives up to everyone's expectations. Marike is awarded the Essent Award for young musical talent, and the album spends many weeks in the charts. She supports the Canadian artist Feist when on tour in the Netherlands. Feist leaves her a personal message: ‚ÄòIt was very inspiring to share the stage with you.‚Äô Celia Trigger (2008) In 2008, after the band has been joined by drummer Nicky Hustinx, the band releases its second album, Celia Trigger, which receives good reviews and is nominated for the Dutch Edison Awards in two categories: best female artist and best album. A recording of a concert in Nijmegen, part of the band's first theater tour, is released on a DVD in 2010. The Magic Live Box contains the DVD, a cd containing a selection of the songs, and a bonus cd containing piano versions of some of the songs, played by Henk Jan Heuvelink. Here Comes The Night (2011) Marikes third album is something different, something special. The recordings were done by engineer Staf Verbeeck in the Jet Studio, the oldest studio in Belgium and a musical monument where both Edith Piaf and The Rolling Stones have set foot. Soundwise she chooses a new path. ‚ÄòHere comes the night‚Äô was mixed by multiple Grammy Award winner Tchad Blake, an idiosyncratic producer who has worked with such artists as The Black Keys, Tom Waits, Elvis Costello, Ron Sexsmith, and Suzanne Vega. Marike's newest album is very distinctive, with cinematic underpinnings. The band is bursting with energy and Marike's guitar playing is compelling. The recordings were done in the Jet Studio, the oldest studio in Belgium and a musical monument where both Edith Piaf and The Rolling Stones have set foot. In September 2011 Marike is again nominated for two Edisons: 'Best Album' and 'Best Female Artist'.

Education and career Simple proof of Betz' law Betz was born in Schweinfurt. In 1910 he graduated as a naval engineer from Technische Hochschule Berlin (Diplomingenieur Schiffbau). In 1911 Betz became a researcher at the University of G√∂ttingen aerodynamics laboratory, where he was awarded his PhD in 1919 for his work on 'ship propellers with minimum loss of energy'. In his 1920 paper \\"Das Maximum der theoretisch m√∂glichen Ausnutzung des Windes durch Windmotoren\\" (\\"Theoretical Limit for Best Utilization of Wind by Wind Motors\\") was published. His work was based on earlier studies by Frederick Lanchester that included the first full description of lift and drag. The formulation was somewhat complex and had to wait for Ludwig Prandtl's version before becoming generally useful. Betz' law states that, independent of the design of a wind turbine, only 16/27 (or 59%) of the kinetic energy of the wind can be converted to mechanical energy. His book \\"Wind-Energie und ihre Ausnutzung durch Windm√ºhlen\\" (\\"Wind Energy and its Use by Windmills\\"), published in 1926, gives a good account of the understanding of wind energy and wind turbines at that period. In 1926 he was appointed professor at G√∂ttingen. In 1936 he succeeded Ludwig Prandtl as director of the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt (AVA, aerodynamics laboratory), a position he held until 1956.Betz \\"Manager from 1937 to 1957\\" (on the AVA website)The Dawn of Fluid Dynamics, Michael Echert, Wiley, pp 180-181, describes Prandtl's promotion by the Nazi regime, and replacement by Betz in 1936, under the Luftwaffe command.

In early 1945 he participated in the attempt to evacuate the Z4 (computer) to the AVA under his supervision.The Z4 evacuation (The Konrad Zuse website) From 1947 to 1956 he also headed research into hydrodynamics at the Max Planck Institute.Experimenting Close to the Wind about the advent of the wind tunnel (English, Max Planck Institute website) He was the great uncle of the author Alfred J. Betz from Philadelphia, and great nephew of Vladimir Alekseyevich Betz the discoverer of the pyramidal cell. Betz died in G√∂ttingen, aged 82. Recognition Betz received the Ludwig- Prandtl-Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for \\"outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering\\" in 1958.

He lived in London's Leicester Square from 1825 to 1827 but many of his buildings were built in the seaside town of Worthing in Sussex and he is credited as being the town's principal Georgian architect. In Worthing Rebecca designed St. Paul's Chapel of Ease (now St. Paul's Church), Beach House and 19-20 Marine Parade, which housed Stafford's Marine Library in the 19th century. 19 Marine Parade was known as Rebecca House as it was believed that the architect himself stayed in the building. Rebecca was also the architect of Worthing's Royal Baths (now demolished) and several other buildings around the town. The Royal Sea House in Worthing, later the Royal Hotel, with Ionic columns and pilasters was rebuilt to Rebecca's designs in 1829 (and destroyed by fire in 1901). Rebecca designed Castle Goring at Goring-by-Sea for Sir Bysshe Shelley, 1st Baronet. Howard Colvin called the house \\"an extraordinary fantasy, suavely neo-classical on one side and romantically castellated on the other\\". Around 1813‚Äì16 Rebecca designed the facade of Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, for Mrs Bulwer-Lytton. Also in the 1820s he restored Penshurst Place, Kent, in Tudor Gothic style, and it was probably to Rebecca's designs that Sir John Shelley Sidney rebuilt the Sidney Chapel. Around 1820 Buckingham House (originally 'Buckinghams' or 'Buckingham Place') in Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex was rebuilt to John Rebecca's designs. Its grounds are now Buckingham Park but the house itself lies in ruins. The Old Rectory at the village of Crowell, Oxfordshire was designed by Rebecca and built in 1822.

Early life James Riley was born in Middletown, Connecticut on October 27, 1777. At age 15, he began serving as a cabin boy on a trading vessel in the West Indies. By age 20 he had become a ship captain. He married Phebe Miller in January 1802, and they had five children. Sufferings in Africa Riley led his crew through the Sahara Desert, after they were shipwrecked off the coast of contemporary Western Sahara in August 1815, and wrote a memoir about their ordeal. This true story describes how they came to be shipwrecked and their travails in the Sahara. The book, published in 1817 and originally titled Authentic Narrative of the Loss of the American Brig 'Commerce' by the 'Late Master and Supercargo' James Riley, is modernly republished as Sufferings in Africa. Lost in this unknown world, Captain Riley felt responsible for his crew and their safety. He told of the events leading to their capture by marauding Sahrawi natives who kept them as slaves. Horribly mistreated, they were beaten, sun-burnt, starved, and forced to drink their own and camel urine. A slave would be worked until close to death and then either traded or killed. 431x431px Aftermath Once back on American shore, Riley devoted himself to anti-slavery work but eventually returned to a life at sea. He died March 13, 1840, on his vessel the Brig William Tell between New York and St. Thomas, \\"of disease caused by unparalleled suffering more than twenty years previous during his shipwreck and captivity on the desert of Sahara.\\" The lives of his crew were foreshortened, no doubt, from complications caused by their hardships in the African desert. The last surviving crewman was the cabin boy, who lived to be 82. In 1851, eleven years after Riley's death at sea, the publishing firm of G. Brewster issued the book Sequel to Riley's Narrative: Being a Sketch of Interesting Incidents in the Life, Voyages and Travels of Capt. James Riley, from the Period of His Return to His Native Land, After His Shipwreck, Captivity and Sufferings Among the Arabs of the Desert, as Related in His Narrative, Until His Death. Influence Riley founded the midwestern village of Willshire, Ohio, which he named for William Willshire, the man who redeemed him from slavery. Abraham Lincoln, who later became president of the United States, listed Sufferings in Africa, as one of the three most influential works that shaped his political ideology, particularly his views on slavery. The others were the Bible and The Pilgrim's Progress (1678).

It stars Stephen Geoffreys, Jim Metzler, Maria Rubell, Pat O'Bryan, and Sandy Dennis. The film's title refers to the 976 telephone exchange, a now mostly defunct premium-rate telephone number system that was popular in the late 1980s, but has since been superseded by area code 900. Plot Cousins Lenard aka Spike (Patrick O'Bryan) and Hoax (Stephen Geoffreys) are teenagers who live with Hoax's overtly religious mother Lucy (Sandy Dennis). While Spike is the neighborhood motorcycle bad boy, Hoax is an introverted nerd. Even though Spike genuinely cares for his cousin and protects him from bullies, Hoax is filled with resentment that he cannot stand up for himself or get the girl he wants (both of which Spike does effortlessly). Both boys stumble upon 976-EVIL, which on the surface is just a novelty phone line that gives creepy-themed fortunes for a few dollars. However, the line is actually used by Satan to subtly corrupt mortals into his bidding. Spike loses interest in the line quickly, but Hoax soon discovers the true nature of the line and uses it to get revenge on everyone who has wronged him. Soon Hoax's spirit is almost entirely consumed by Satan, who possesses Hoax to cause death and destruction, culminating in an opening to Hell appearing before their house. Spike confronts Hoax, but is quickly overpowered. In a desperate last ploy, he calls earnestly to his cousin, reminding him of the plans they had to take a vacation that summer. Hoax's fleeting soul resurfaces briefly, and realizes his horrible mistake and embraces Spike, begging for help. Spike, realizing Hoax is lost and cannot be separated from the demonic presence, betrays his cousin and throws him into the pit of Hell. Release The film was released theatrically in the United States by New Line Cinema in March 1989. It grossed $2,955,917 at the box office. The film was released on home video by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video the same year. VHS, and LaserDisc versions of the film are uncut and contain footage previously unseen in its original theatrical release. The film was released on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in 2002. The DVD version as well as the Crackle version are the theatrical cut. Both versions were released on Blu-ray on October 3, 2017.  Critical reception  976-EVIL received a negative critical reception and currently has an approval rating of 9% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 11 reviews. The Washington Post wrote \\"From start to finish, 976-EVIL is a sorry, wrong number.\\" AllMovie however defended the film, calling it \\"underrated\\". John Fallon of JoBlo.com gave the film 6/10 stars and remarked that it \\"could've been great stuff\\", but \\"loses its touch in its second half, relying on unsatisfying murders and \\"ho-hum\\" effects to pad it up though.\\" Sequel A direct-to-video sequel entitled 976-EVIL II: The Astral Factor was released in 1992, with Patrick O'Bryan reprising his role as Spike.

Many roof coatings are elastomeric, that is, they have elastic properties that allow them to stretch and return to their original shape without damage. Typical roof coating dry film thickness vary from paint film thickness (plus or minus 0.075 mm (3 dry mils) to more than 1 mm (40 dry mils). This means a roof coating actually becomes the top layer of a composite roof membrane and underlying system. As such, the roof coating is the topmost layer of protection for the membrane, receiving the impact of sunlight (both infrared and ultraviolet (UV), rain, hail and physical damage. Roof Coatings should not be confused with deck coatings. Deck coatings are traffic bearing - designed for waterproofing areas where pedestrian (and in some cases vehicular) traffic is expected. Roof coatings will only waterproof the substrates but will not withstand any kind of on going use by people or vehicles (such as walkways, patios, sundecks, restaurants, etc.). Benefits A heat reduction was observed on this modified bitumen roof with a white, reflective roof coating. Roof coatings are seamless and when installed correctly, can solve roof leaks on almost any type of roofing material. There are exceptions: \\"professionals do not recommend using cool coatings over existing shingles. This technique can cause moisture problems and water damage because the coating can inhibit normal shingle drying after rain or dew accumulation, allowing water to condense and collect under the shingles.\\"‚ÄúCool Roofs‚Äù chapter of EPA‚Äôs Reducing Urban Heat Islands: Compendium of Strategies Page 19 ‚Äú4.3 Installation and Maintenance‚Äù Field-applied reflective roof coatings can extend the useful life of nearly every roof substrate keeping a roof surface cool and providing a level of protection from the sun and weather. However, coating asphalt shingles and built-up composition roofs requires more caution. The National Roofing Contractors Association‚Äôs (NRCA) director of technical services has stated \\"The roofing industry is aware of a number of issues that could have negative consequences for field application of coatings over asphalt shingle roof systems. Anyone considering this type of application should be aware of the concerns so they can weigh them against the benefits claimed in coating product promotional materials.\\"\\"Myth busting\\" Maciek Rupar, Professional Roofing, Professional Roofing / National Roofing Contractors Assn, 4/2010, Page(s) 36-39 Roof coatings can add 25 years to the service life of a roof and reduce the amount of discarded roofing materials that end up in landfills. The infrared image on the right shows on the uncoated (black) section of the modified bitumen roof. The coated (white) section is . Field studies have shown that cool roof coatings can lower rooftop temperatures and reduce air conditioning bills. Limitations/Risks Most flat roofs are not perfectly sloped, causing water to puddle in some areas, in particular around the drains and scuppers. Many roof coatings are not rated or warranted for \\"ponding water\\", and thus might fail pre-maturely if exposed to standing water over long periods of time. Serious consideration should be given to the performance and limitations of the coating being selected. Some manufacturers will warranty their coatings including ponding water. Typically, manufacturers for acrylic roof coatings do not include warranties for ponding water, while some polyurethane and silicone roof coatings manufacturers will. Types of Roof Coatings There are many different types of roof coatings with various purposes, formulated with various chemistries. The primary purposes of roof coatings are: resaturation of old roofs to extend the service life of the roof, reflectivity to create a \\"cool roof\\", and toughness to provide a wearing surface on the roof that can resist abrasion from foot traffic or other physical damage, such as from hail. Primary materials used in roof coating formulation include acrylics, asphalt, butyl, coal tar pitch, polyurea, polyurethanes, polyvinylidene fluoride, silicones, and styrene-butadiene. Application Prepping the seams on a Metal Roof Prior to the Application of a Roof Coating Top coating a commercial flat roof with a cool roof test Roof coatings are easy to install. Smaller roofs in good, serviceable condition can be a weekend do-it-yourself (DIY) project. Larger roofs with leaks and ponding water issues should be coated by a qualified professional. Additional roof coating products, such as foam or coatings designed for seams, may be required underneath the main coating layers. Supplement coating products are used to reinforce damaged or leak-prone problem areas. =Tools and equipment= High pressure airless spray equipment, pressure washers with a rotary (turbo) nozzle, roof repair equipment and basic painting tools such as brushes, rollers, putty knives, and scaffolding.

Retrieved on 10 January 2009. Flight ADC Airlines Flight 53 departed Lagos (LOS) on a scheduled domestic flight to Sokoto (SKO) with an intermediate stop at Abuja (ABV). While on ground in Lagos, it uplifted some fuel. There was only cabin crew change. The aircraft departed Lagos on scheduled passenger service Flight 63 at 09:29 local time and landed in Abuja at 10:20. At Abuja at 11:14, the crew of the aircraft requested start-up clearance. This was given along with the prevailing weather information. At 11:21, the crew requested clearance to taxi to the holding point and a wind check; both were given. Over the following six minutes Abuja Tower gave a series of six wind reports, including a statement emphasising the gusty nature of the wind. A thunderstorm was approaching the airport and weather was worsening. At 11:26, the crew of flight 53 requested clearance for immediate takeoff, and the controller re-emphasized the deteriorating weather condition and gave latest wind check, which they acknowledged. Immediately after takeoff from runway 22, the Boeing 737 entered into a headwind -shift to-tailwind windshear, which significantly affected the aerodynamic performance of the airplane. The Pilot Flying responded to the windshear by adding a small amount of power and by pulling back on the control column causing a significant pitch attitude change. The Pilot-not-flying responded to the windshear by calling for the Pilot Flying to pull up. The airplane then entered into a full aerodynamic stall followed by a roll to the left of over 90 degrees and steep descent into the ground. The aircraft was pitched to an attitude that resulted in the temporary disruption of airflow to and momentary loss of power in both engines. The airplane broke up and caught fire in a corn field. After three unsuccessful attempts to contact the aircraft, the Tower advised the Approach Control to call Flight 53. Other aircraft on the apron (Virgin Nigeria Airlines Flight 42 and Trade Wings Flight 2401), which were on that frequency were also asked to assist in contacting the aircraft but all attempts were unsuccessful. Kano and Lagos Area Controls were requested to contact Flight 53, but there was no response from the aircraft. Abuja Flight Communication Centre was then advised to inform National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) in Kano about the loss of contact with the aircraft. At 11:38, Flight Communication Centre called the Control Tower that someone came from a nearby village (Tungar Madaki) near the radar site and reported that a plane had crashed in their village. A search party from the airport was dispatched and they found and confirmed that the plane had crashed shortly after takeoff. 96 people were killed. Aircraft The plane was manufactured in 1983. Shortly after, it was delivered to USAir as N323AU. In 1988, the aircraft changed its registration code as N279AU. In 1997, it was delivered to US Airways and in 1999 it operated by the company's MetroJet subsidiary. It was delivered to leasing company Celtic Capital and leased to Aviation Development Company (ADC) in September 2003. The plane had been checked for an inspection on 28 July 2005. It was due for another check on 27 January 2007. Investigation The Nigerian Aircraft Investigation Bureau started an investigation for the cause of the crash with representatives from the U.S National Transportation Safety Board. Investigators examined the wreckage and the crash site. Based on their examination, the left wing of the aircraft first made contact with a tree branch. The aircraft impacted the ground with a high nose up position and an extreme left bank. The airplane disintegrated and a fuel spill ignited an inferno. Ninety-six of the one hundred and five persons on board were fatally injured by impact forces and post-crash fire as the majority of the fuselage section of the aircraft was destroyed. One cabin crew member, aft seated, survived along with eight other passengers as the structure in their immediate environment remained substantially intact. A cumulonimbus cloud. Most windshear occurs in this type of cloud. Analysis from black box: Just before takeoff, the crew confirmed reports of windshear, as evident from the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). During takeoff, the intensity of the rain increased to heavy. The first sign of difficulty was heard on the CVR just two seconds after the first officer called \\"eighty knots\\". The captain replied with \\"Ah\\" instead of saying \\"checked\\". Four seconds later, the landing gear was retracted and the V2 callout was given by the first officer. Two seconds after the V2 callout, a windshear warning was triggered, as the aircraft experienced a rapid change in wind direction. In trying to recover, the crew pitched the nose up to between 30¬∞ and 35¬∞ as revealed by the FDR, thereby greatly exceeding the critical angle of attack, activating the stick-shaker (as confirmed by the cockpit voice recorder). As a result of the high pitch attitude, the airflow into the engines was disrupted causing the both engines to experience a compressor stall. Flight control inputs by the crew resulted in an aerodynamic stall, altitude loss, and subsequent ground impact. As a result of the rapid descent, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) was indicated to have been producing terrain warnings until impact. NASA Boeing 737 Analysis from the pilot's reaction: Although bad weather created the situation to which the pilots reacted, their reaction was not in accordance with windshear recovery procedure. The simulator training the crew undertook at Sabena Flight Academy in Brussels, Belgium did not adequately prepare them to handle the situation in which they found themselves, even though the aircraft appeared to have enough energy to fly through the adverse weather condition. The simulator used for the training did not have the same facilities as the actual aircraft; windshear recognition and recovery was not part of the simulator training the first officer received. The captain received windshear training but it was not applicable as the simulator was not the same as the actual aircraft. Throughout the emergency period (from the first windshear warning to the ground impact) the responses from the pilot- not-flying was not in conformity with the windshear recovery procedures. Illustration of a windshear occurred near an airport. This one, published by NASA, stated that if a windshear occurred in front of the aircraft, pilots should climb to avoid the windshear. Data shown from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency showed that at 09:30 and 09:45, there were scattered low top cumulus clouds. Investigators noted that significant cloud formation had occurred in the area. However, the cloud formation suddenly 'exploded' sometime between 09:45 and 11:00 UTC, and became a storm cell. These 'explosion' was called as a rapid intensification. Conditions evolved from scatteredlow-top cumulus to an isolated convective cell with estimated tops to above 45000 ft in just over an hour. =Final report= The Nigerian AIB finally concluded that the cause of the crash was due to pilot error, as stated: Investigators also stated several contributing factors: Consequently, the AIB noted that the radar in the airport was off at the time of the accident. This caused a confusion and difficulty in finding the crashed plane. Had the radar not been turned off, there would be more survivors.

Early life Muriel was born on November 23, 1900 in New York City. She was the daughter of William Kissam Vanderbilt II (1878‚Äì1944) and Virginia Graham Fair (1875‚Äì1935). Her paternal grandparents were William Kissam Vanderbilt and Alva Erskine Smith. Harold Stirling Vanderbilt was her uncle and Consuelo Vanderbilt, the Duchess of Marlborough until her divorce from Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough in 1921, was her aunt. Her maternal grandfather, James Graham Fair, was a United States Senator from Nevada who made a large fortune investing in silver mines on the Comstock Lode. Her parents separated when she was a small girl and she would grow up on Long Island and on the West Coast of the United States where her mother had been born. Career She shared her father and grandfather Vanderbilt's love of horses. Her mother was also a fan of Thoroughbred horse racing and established Fair Stable that in 1924 and 1925 won back-to-back Horse of the Year honors with Sarazen. She owned a ranch near Carmel, California where she built stables and kept thoroughbred racehorses. In 1930, it was reported that she received permission by the Chief of police of Middletown to carry a pistol after riding breeches were stolen from her. In 1947, with her third husband, she bought Edenvale Farms, a horse farm south of San Jose, California where she bred and raised Thoroughbreds and built her own private training track. Her horse, Miche, won the 1952 Santa Anita Handicap and Desert Trial captured several important West Coast stakes including back- to-back editions of the Ramona Handicap. In 1956, she sold Edenvale Farm to Samuel Hamburger of San Francisco, for $650,000, who in turn sold it to real estate developers for approximately $1 million. Later in life, Muriel Vanderbilt Adams owned an horse farm in Marion County, Florida. Bred and trained at her Ocala farm in 1970, Desert Vixen was the most famous horse she ever owned and bred and in 1979 the filly was inducted into the United States' National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. The farm is now part of the exclusive gated community, Jumbolair. Personal life Muriel Vanderbilt married three times, the first in 1925 to Frederic Cameron Church, Jr., a Boston insurance executive. The marriage ended in divorce in 1929 and in September 1931, she married New Yorker Henry Delafield Phelps (1902‚Äì1976). Divorced from her second husband in 1936, she married for a third time in 1944 to John Payson Adams. Muriel died in Florida on February 3, 1972 at the age of seventy-one.

One of Worthing's two Grade I listed buildings (deemed by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport to be of exceptional interest), it has been described by architectural critic Ian Nairn as reflecting \\"the equivocal taste of the 1790s as well as anywhere in the country.\\"Nairn, Ian and Pevsner, Nikolaus(1965), \\"Sussex: Buildings of England\\" Castle Goring was designed by John Rebecca for Sir Bysshe Shelley, 1st Baronet. It was intended that his grandson, the renowned poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, would live at Castle Goring; however, he drowned in Italy aged 29, so he never took possession of the house. In 1845, Mary Shelley, who inherited the building as widow of the poet, sold it to tenant Sir George Brooke-Pechell who'd been residing at the property since 1825. It is currently owned by Lady Colin Campbell.Lady Colin Campbell (website retrieved 28 September 2018):http://www.castlegoring.com/ladyc.html Location When it was built in the 1790s, Castle Goring was in the far north of the parish. Since Goring-by- Sea became part of the borough of Worthing in 1929, development has extended to the borders of the Castle Goring estate, and the estate now borders on the West Durrington area of the town, several kilometres from the original centre of Goring. Castle Goring lies adjacent to the A27 road from Worthing to Chichester, at grid reference TQ 102056, to the northwest of Worthing. It also lies within the South Downs National Park next to ancient woodland at Titnore Wood. Architecture The building has a front and rear of different styles. The north side of Castle Goring is Gothic and is thought to resemble Arundel Castle to the west, while the south side has a Greco-Palladian front of yellow brick, said to be a copy of the Villa Lante near Rome. English Heritage has described Castle Goring as \\"the most complete example of the 'carnival-style' of the era\\".http://archive.theargus.co.uk/2004/6/30/111948.html As the building has always been in private ownership, little is known about the interior. There is known to be a glass dome in the centre of the building, above a spiral staircase. The building's owners do not welcome visitors and relatively few photographs of the building exist in the public domain. However, in 2016 the present owner, Lady Colin Campbell, allowed the interior of the building to be extensively filmed and shown in an ITV documentary, Lady C and the Castle. On 7 January 2017, the castle's interior and exterior were also shown when Lady Colin Campbell was a subject on the ITV show Through the Keyhole. Further views of the interior, including the glass dome which is said to be the oldest in the UK in a private home (and in need of extensive renovation) were shown in an episode of Salvage Hunters on Quest in 2017. History Castle Goring was designed by John Rebecca for Sir Bysshe Shelley, 1st Baronet. The building was the first of several that Rebecca designed in the Georgian era around the then fashionable resort town of Worthing. Sir Bysshe Shelley's son, Sir Timothy Shelley, preferred to live at Field Place near Horsham. It was intended that his son, Percy Bysshe Shelley, would live at Castle Goring; however, the poet drowned in Italy aged just 29, so he never took possession. In 1825, Sir Timothy Shelley let the building to Captain (later Vice Admiral) Sir George Brooke-Pechell, 4th Baronet of Paglesham, lord of the manor of Angmering, who was Liberal MP for Brighton from 1835-1860. In 1845, Mary Shelley, who inherited the building as widow of the poet, sold it to Brooke-Pechel. Brooke-Pechel's daughter, Adelaide, married Sir Alfred FC Somerset, who was Deputy Lieutenant for Middlesex and Justice of the Peace for Middlesex. Their daughter Gwendoline married her cousin, Arthur W Fitzroy Somerset, who held the same offices for Sussex. Aside from a period in the 1870s and 1880s when the property was let to the Burrell family, the property has remained with the Somerset family until 2014.Elleray, D Robert (1998), Millennium Encyclopaedia of Worthing History E300195311 Lady Colin Campbell is current owner. The future left By the start of the 21st century, the future of the building had looked bleak. Castle Goring had been left to decay to the point that it was on Historic England‚Äôs Heritage at Risk Register, which described its situation as \\"very grave\\". Historic England described Castle Goring as being of priority category A, its highest priority. It was defined as at \\"immediate risk of further rapid deterioration or loss of fabric; no solution agreed\\". Structural surveyors working on behalf of Worthing Borough Council tried, unsuccessfully, to gain access to the building several times. A full survey of Castle Goring was finally carried out in July 2003, using the council's legal powers to gain entry. The report was completed in January 2004 and set out details of the repairs considered necessary to \\"retain the architectural and historic importance of the building and sets out a timescale over which the repairs should be carried out\\". It is known that an evaluation study was carried out for a golf resort within the castle estate. However, it was not clear whether the building itself would have been renovated under the scheme. In 2010, Castle Goring and its estate was included in the South Downs National Park. In 2013, Lady Colin Campbell purchased the property and in November 2015, she said that she had decided to be a contestant on the popular television show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in order to pay to replace the castle's roof. The Heritage at Risk Register reports that consent for change of use to a wedding/conference venue has been granted and repairs to the roof, stairs and structural timbers have been carried out. It is now priority category F.

There are 1,186 students on roll, of whom 230 are in the sixth form. Students from a White British background represent 82% of the school population. Although the school is located in the Falcon Lodge area of Sutton Coldfield, it also serves pupils from elsewhere in Birmingham such as Erdington and Castle Vale. In 2006 (at the time of the last Ofsted report) the proportions of students receiving free school meals and students who have special educational needs were reported as being above the national average. History John Willmott Grammar School was founded in the name of Alderman John Willmott. It was opened in 1958 as a co-educational grammar school in an award-winning building. The school's last year of selective intake, based on the 12+ test, was 1974. It became a comprehensive and changed its name to John Willmott School in 1975. House system In 2016, John Willmott re-introduced a house system. With new names. Spitfire, Lancaster, Hurricane and Wellington. Curriculum The school has been at the forefront of vocational education both locally and nationally. Sixth Form vocational courses have run since 1991, and currently include Art and Design, Business Studies, Childcare, Leisure and Tourism, and Sport and Leisure. In September 2006, the school introduced a range of vocational courses at GCSE level which are in addition to those already available in the sixth form. These vocational courses are intended to complement the traditional GCSE courses already available. The school has been awarded Lead Department status for Business Studies for the city of Birmingham. Statistics When Ofsted inspected the school in March 2006, it graded achievement and standards as Grade 3 (\\"Satisfactory\\"). The Sixth Form was graded as \\"Good\\". Since then, the overall results have improved at a rate faster than the national average, with 2009 results reaching a new high, and the best results in the school's history. The school received its highest GCSE achievement grades, with 70% of pupils getting 5 or more A*-C GCSE grades. The overall A Level pass rate shot up from 90% to 97% - the best A level results since the school was a grammar school. When Ofsted inspected the school in February 2016, the school was found to be \\"Inadequate and Requiring Improvement\\".http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find- inspection-report/provider/ELS/103522 Extra-curricular activities A wide range of activities are available for students in after-school clubs and societies. Each year group has an Achievement Group which runs additional activities including early morning Basketball and gardening. A number of foreign visits are organised by subject departments during the year; these include language exchange trips to France and Germany, skiing trips, RE trip to China, Geography trips to Sicily and Iceland, History trip to Paris and Sixth Form Art trip to Barcelona. The school holds an annual drama production. Recent productions have included Grease, The Boyfriend, Anything Goes, Calamity Jane, South Pacific, We Will Rock You, Back to the Eighties, Little Shop of Horrors and Bugsy Malone. Annual fund-raising events are organised by students, most notably Evening of Culture. An annual Art Exhibition of Sixth Form and GCSE artwork is also held. Sixth Form The school has an independent Sixth Form which is part of the Sutton Coldfield Consortium. This involves offering subjects unavailable elsewhere and allowing students to study certain subjects at other schools. The Sixth Form, run by Ms. Richards, offers both academic and vocational courses, and provides many opportunities for the students to engage in extra-curricular activities and many trips. One group of Sixth Formers raised funds to go to America and rebuild Ground Zero. Sport Football has been the main sport at John Willmott School for the later part of its history, overtaking rugby. Rugby started off as its predominant sport when John Willmott was a grammar school. It has become gradually less popular, but rugby is being re-introduced at the school and an effort is being made to create a new team to represent the school. Many other sports are offered, such as softball, tennis, badminton, trampolining, table tennis, volleyball, athletics, dancing and basketball.

Focusing on charter, the airline operated two Boeing 737-300 aircraft from 1988 to 1992, after which it operated two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft, one MD-83 and one MD-87. The airline flew a single scheduled route, between Oslo Airport, Fornebu and London Gatwick Airport, at first on contract with Air Europe and from 1991 at its own expense. At its peak, Norway Airlines had 196 employees. The company struggled financially and lost more than 100 million Norwegian krone (NOK) before terminating operations, having never made a profit. The airline was established by Tr√∏ndelag-based investors on 2 April 1987, having been originally intended to operate charter flights to the Mediterranean area. Ansett Australia was an early investor, but soon sold out. The company suffered with its main contractor, Sun Tours, going bankrupt in 1988, after which the airline moved to the British charter market. Air Europe's holding company bought a third of Norway Airlines in October 1989; this allowed the Norwegian company to start flying Air Europe's route between Oslo and Gatwick as a wet lease operation, in addition to several international destinations from London. Air Europe went bankrupt in March 1991, causing Norway Airlines to temporarily halt operations. Sterling Airways came in as a new strategic minority owner, and the two airlines started an alliance along with Transwede. Their key goal was to secure concessions to fly between the Scandinavian capital cities of Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen, but no permission was ever granted. Instead Norway Airlines started its own service between Oslo and London. Operations ceased on 14 October 1992 after the board had filed for bankruptcy. History =Establishment= Norway Airlines was established on 2 April 1987 by Kjell Adser√∏ and his holding company Hell Holding, along with several other investors from Tr√∏ndelag‚Äîthe largest of which was Lyng Industrier. The business model was to operate charter flights from Norway to the Mediterranean; eighty percent of the market was carried out with foreign airlines and Adser√∏ believed that Norwegians not only would prefer a Norwegian carrier, but would be willing to pay more for one. The company had an initial share capital of NOK 10 million and established its head office and main base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. Separate companies, organized as kommandittselskap, were established to own each aircraft and lease them to the airline. The aircraft owner companies paid 28.7 million United States dollars for each Boeing 737-300, which were delivered new from Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Shares in the aircraft owning companies was offered to the public with a four-percent annual return on investment. Part of the investment model was based on tax advantages. Norway Airlines Boeing 737-300 The share capital was expanded to NOK 20 million in September 1987. Among the purchasers was Ansett Australia, who bought a twenty-percent stake. Ragnar Lyng replaced Adeser√∏ as chairman and Johan H. Gedde-Dahl was hired as managing director. Original plans were to start operations on 24 October 1987, but this had to be postponed due to late delivery of the aircraft. Revenue flights commenced in February 1988, after delivery of the airline's first 148-passenger Boeing 737-300, City of Trondheim. The airline's second 737-300, City of Stavanger, was delivered the same month, but was leased to Monarch Airlines. About sixty percent of the company's initial business was flying on contract with Sun Tours. Gedde-Dahl was replaced by Kristian √Öreskjold in March 1988. The company lost NOK 15 million in 1987 and budgeted with a deficit of NOK 13 million the following year. To cover the losses, the airline issued a private placement for NOK 12 million and a public issue of NOK 18 million. The airline retained only a single aircraft in operation until late 1989 and the staff of 50 to 60 employees was too much for the revenue form a single aircraft to cover. The airline planned to acquire a third aircraft in 1990 and budgeted with a profit of NOK 7 million in 1989 and NOK 32 million in 1990. Sun Tours filed for bankruptcy in late May 1988. However, √Öreskjold stated that the bankruptcy \\"came at a convenient time\\" as in the short term Norway Airlines would fly back Sun Tours customers at the expense of the Norwegian Travel Guarantee Fund and that there was a deficit of aircraft on the European charter market. Within a week, Norway Airlines had signed a contract to fly with both aircraft for Britannia Airways out of London Gatwick Airport. A new issue of shares for NOK 25 to 30 million took place in June 1988 and the company stated its intent to list itself on the Trondheim Stock Exchange. Nils Erik Christensen had by then been appointed chairman. Norway Airlines aircraft in Air Europe livery in 1989 =Air Europe= The airline was by September again in need of new capital. The contracts with Britannia ended on 1 November. While there was a high demand for 737-300 aircraft, aviation regulations hindered Norway Airlines from wet leaseing the aircraft (with full crew) and limited them to dry leaseing (without crew), which jeopardized the jobs of 86 employees. There were speculations in mid-October that Air Europe was planning to purchase Norway Airlines. Lyng had by then bought Ansett's share and held a 55-percent ownership. Norway Airlines announced on 25 October that they would lease both their aircraft to Air Europe on a five-year contract, one aircraft from November 1988 and one from March 1989. The airline would have to continue with ad-hoc charters for the one aircraft until March. The deal also involved that the United Kingdom-based International Leisure Group (ILG) would purchase a 33-percent share of Norway Airlines through a private placement of NOK 25 million. Air Europe announced on 6 December 1988 that they would start a scheduled service between Oslo-Fornebu and London-Gatwick and intended to offer cheaper flights than the incumbents Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and British Airways. Operations started on 15 May, using Norway Airline's 737-300, which was reconfigured to seat 142 passengers in a two-class layout. Norway Airlines announced that they would take the brand name Air Europe Scandinavia and would paint their aircraft in the Air Europe livery, albeit with the Flag of Norway. Air Europe simultaneously started services from Copenhagen and Stockholm to London. The Oslo‚ÄìLondon route immediately achieved an eighty-percent cabin factor, with about twenty percent of its sales in business class. The capacity was doubled from November to two daily round trips. Other routes flown on behalf of Air Europe were from London to Rome, Gibraltar and Malta, although occasionally the aircraft could be used on other services. The London routes had after a year achieved a twenty-percent market share. Norway Airlines had by July 1990 lost an accumulated NOK 75 million and new shares worth NOK 40 million were issued to finance continued operations. Aircraft in Air Europe livery Norway Airlines applied in 1990 for permission to operate a charter route from Oslo to Penang, Malaysia, using a Boeing 757. The application was dismissed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications to protect SAS' route from Copenhagen to Singapore. The Penang route was necessary for Norway Airlines to procure a third aircraft, which according to the company was necessary to generate a profit, and would have created 100 new jobs. In the meantime, Tj√¶reborg Reiser sent their charter passengers with scheduled flights to London and onwards with British carriers to Malaysia. The dismissal was appealed to Minister of Transport and Communications, Lars Gunnar Lie of the Christian Democratic Party. The issue became a political issue within Syse's Cabinet, as the Conservative Party and the Progress Party were both in favor of increased deregulation of the airline industry. The issue was complicated by the common aviation policy of the three Scandinavian counties, which had largely been established to protect SAS' interest on international services. The cabinet therefore opened for discussion a further deregulation with the governments of Sweden and Denmark. The Conservative Party stated that this was in part a response to Danish and Swedish authorities allowing charter services to Phuket, Thailand, which could be seen as competing to SAS' route to Bangkok. Syse's Cabinet resigned on 3 November over issues regarding Norway and the European Union, before a reply to the application could be made. The airline reached a non-public settlement with Thor Tj√∏ntveit on 10 September regarding the latter's right to purchase one of Norway Airline's aircraft. Norway Airlines lost NOK 12 million in 1990. In January 1991, the airline won the contract to fly personnel the Norwegian Armed Forces, as the airline priced half a million krone lower than Busy Bee. Operations started in April and secured sufficient business that the airline could order its third aircraft, along with a contract from Gullivers Reiser for additional charter flights. Within a week it received concession to operate scheduled flights between Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm to London. A similar concession was also granted to Braathens SAFE, but they stated that the intense competition on the route would make it difficult for them to start a service. However, the five-year concession required that Norway Airlines not have any foreign citizens in the board; as two representatives for ILG sat on the board, they would have to resign for the concession to be valid. The Progress Party called for the law to be changed. Norway Airlines also applied for a route from Bergen and Stavanger to London. Boeing 737-300 aircraft in a transitory Air Europe‚ÄìNorway Airlines livery Air Europe fell under financial distress in 1991 and terminated all its Gatwick operations on 8 March. This resulted in Norway Airlines having to ground both its aircraft. Before operations could commence, the two creditors of the aircraft, Fokus Bank and Christiania Bank, had to refinance the two holding companies. As the aircraft remained grounded when the military contract started on 1 April, Norway Airlines had to lease aircraft externally to operate the charters. The aircraft were freed up towards the end of April, allowing the services with Gullivers Reiser to commence on 28 April. Originally the leases on the aircraft expired 1 April 1993 and 1994, respectively, but Norway Airlines renegotiated them to both expire 1 April 1994. The Gullivers Reiser contract involved flying from Norway to Greece, Spain, Portugal and Turkey. Air Europe's bankruptcy cost Norway Airlines NOK 6 million and required the company to reduce its staff from 196 to 106 employees. One aircraft was fully utilized, although the second was occasionally operated for Star Tour, Vingreiser and British Airways. =Nordic cooperation= Denmark's Sterling Airways bought ILG's share of Norway Airlines in mid July. The airlines announced a partnership, which also included Transwede. The Wallenberg- controlled NRT owned a 48-percent stake in Sterling and 66 percent of Transwede‚Äîthe remaining third owned by Sterling. The three airlines applied for concessions to operate on the capital triangle between Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. SAS held a monopoly on these routes and the airlines intended to capture the leisure market between the capital regions. Both ILG and Sterling were hindered in owning more than a third of Norway Airlines because of Norwegian corporate legislation. Fokus Bank had gradually become the largest shareholder in Norway Airline and owned 40.6 percent of the company in July 1991. At a shareholders meeting in July, Stein √òxseth was appointed chairman and all non-Norwegian board members were replaced. Norway Airlines introduced the McDonnell Douglas MD-83 in 1992 In September 1991, the government changed the policy for the military's procurement of air transport from 1 April 1992. This involved that the transport of 200,000 people annually would be transferred to scheduled services, resulting in Norway Airlines losing the opportunity to extend its engagement with the military. The route from Oslo to London was introduced on 3 October, at first with four weekly services, increasing to nine from 23 October. The three partner airlines launched their alliance as the TransNordic Group and would use a bowler hat as their common symbol. However, the routes arrived so late in the evening that the last flights from Fornebu to Trondheim, Bergen, Stavanger and Troms√∏ had all departed. After five months the airline had achieved a 55-percent cabin factor on the London route. The ministry rejected in December 1991 the airline's application for flying to Stockholm and Copenhagen. By December the British airline Dan-Air had also established itself on the Oslo‚ÄìLondon route. To meet the price competition, SAS launched discounted business class tickets. In the course of twelve months from late 1991 to late 1992, the capacity between Oslo and London doubled, as also Norsk Air introduced a service from Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Norway Airlines lost NOK 32 to 33 million in 1991. Norway Airlines replaced its two 737-300 aircraft with two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft leased from Transwede, one MD-83 and one MD-87. For the owners of the Boeing aircraft the move meant that they had to find a new lessee in a marketed where leasing prices had fallen from US$250,000 to US$150‚Äì180,000 per month. An interlining agreement was signed by Norway Airlines in March with British Airways and 25 other airlines at Gatwick. Norway Airlines announced on 15 March that it would take over the 25 Sterling employees in Norway in October. TransNordic Group started negotiations in June with Braathens SAFE, Maersk Air and Conair of Scandinavia for them to join the alliance. Prior to the roll-out of Amadeus reservation system in July 1992, Norway Airlines had not been included in the default searched of travel agents, who had to phone the airline to get a price quote. McDonnell Douglas MD-83 Foreign airlines were from 1 April 1992 permitted to fly passengers between the Scandinavian capitals, and both TAP Portugal and Delta Air Lines started flying passengers as extensions to their existing routes. This was negotiated as part of bilateral agreements and intra-Scandinavian agreements continued to hinder Norway Airlines from flying any of the routes. As of May, the Ministry of Transport and Communications had received applications to operate from Oslo to the other Scandinavian capitals by six airlines: Norway Airlines, Braathens SAFE, Transwede, Sterling, Maersk Air and Conair. Norway Airline's board voted on 14 October 1992 to file for bankruptcy, and all aircraft were grounded on 15 October 1992. The official reason was \\"the crisis in the airline industry and unacceptable profitability\\", combined with Norwegian authorities' lack of willingness to grant the airline concessions. The airline had lost more than NOK 100 million by the start of the year and had failed to make a profit during 1992. Norway Airlines entered negotiations with Air Holland for the latter to purchase the airline, but the deal fell through on 1 December. Within days of the bankruptcy, Dan-Air also terminated operations. Braathens SAFE therefore decided to start flying the Fornebu‚ÄìGatwick route. Six days after Dan-Air's closure, the first schedules were published in the newspaper; slots and British permission was granted three days after that. The service started another two days later. Organization When established, the company was based at Tananger in Sola outside Stavanger and had its main operative base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. The head office was later moved to Fornebu in B√¶rum outside Oslo, and the main base moved to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. At its peak the company had 196 employees, of which 144 were based in Norway. At the time of bankruptcy, the company had 120 employees, of which 78 were flight staff. Air Europe's CEO Rod Lynch stated that Air Europe, and in extension Norway Airlines, had forty percent lower operating costs than Lufthansa and twenty percent lower than British Airways. Lynch emphasized the lack of trade unions as a key to holding costs down. Air Europe claimed a thirty-four percent market share on passengers between Oslo and London. Norway Airlines had a single-class service on their route and in their marketing claimed that they offered \\"business class service to everyone\\". The airline served a warm in-flight meal and drinks at the level of business class on other airlines. The airline hoped to attract business travelers to travel at a more reasonable fare, while attracting leisure travelers with better service. Norway Airlines pioneered smoke-free flights from Norway. Destinations Norway Airlines only operated a single scheduled service, between Oslo and London. The route was flown nine times per week, two round trips per day on Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays, and one round trip per day on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The route saw an average 60,000 to 70,000 passengers per year. {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" + Norway Airlines destinations ! scope=col  City ! scope=col  Country ! scope=col  Airport - ! scope=row  Oslo  Norway  Oslo Airport, Fornebu - ! scope=row  London  United Kingdom  London Gatwick Airport } Fleet Norway Airlines operated the following aircraft: {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" + Norway Airlines aircraft ! scope=col  Model ! scope=col  Period ! scope=col  Quantity - ! scope=row  Boeing 737-300  1988‚Äì1992  2 - ! scope=row  McDonnell Douglas MD-83  1992  1 - ! scope=row  McDonnell Douglas MD-87  1992  1 } References Category:Defunct airlines of Norway Category:Airlines established in 1987 Category:Airlines disestablished in 1992 Category:1992 disestablishments in Norway Category:Norwegian companies established in 1987 ","title":"Norway Airlines"},{"id":"7678116","text":"is a Japanese conductor.

Biography Holford was educated at Diocesan College, Cape Town and returned to Johannesburg. From 1925‚Äì30 he studied architecture at the University of Liverpool, where he won the British Prix de Rome in Architecture to the British School at Rome in 1930. While in Rome he met British mural painter Marjorie Brooks, who had independently won the British Prix de Rome for Painting, and married her in 1933.http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=400224Holford: A study in architecture, planning and civic design, by Iain Gordon Cherry, Gordon Cherry, L. Penny, page 234 He was a lecturer at the University of Liverpool from 1933 and succeeded Patrick Abercrombie as Professor of Civic Design there in 1937. In 1948 he again succeeded Abercrombie as Professor of Town Planning at University College, London; a post he held until he retired in 1970. Holford was knighted in 1953 and on 29 January 1965 he was made a life peer as Baron Holford, of Kemp Town in the County of Sussex by the Wilson Government, the first town planner to be made a Lord. He served as president of the Royal Town Planning Institute 1953‚Äì54, and of the Royal Institute of British Architects 1960‚Äì62. Works Holford was heavily involved with the development of post-World War II British town planning and was largely responsible for drafting the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. =Cambridge - the Holford-Wright Report= In 1950 Holford, along with H Myles Wright produced a report for Cambridgeshire County Council titles 'Cambridge Planning Proposals' (digitised by Cambridge City Council here). A controversial report, much of his road proposals were never completed. This included his proposal to build a ring road around Cambridge, only sections of which were ever built. These sections include Perne Road, Brooks Road and Barnwell Road. The last of the three was due to link up to Milton Road via a new road bridge over Stourbridge Common but the strength of protests prevented this from ever being built. At Cambridge Railway Station the report also proposed a new footbridge linking East Cambridge directly to the railway station, with a proposed car park and bus stop on a site off Rustat Road opposite the current station. Despite numerous calls over the decades, an eastern entrance to Cambridge railway station has never been built. =Clarendon House= Holford designed significant individual buildings, including Clarendon House in Cornmarket Street, Oxford, which was built in 1956‚Äì57 for F.W. Woolworth. Sir Nikolaus Pevsner commended Clarendon House in Oxford as one of the best recent buildings in the city's main shopping streets and showing \\"how this kind of job can be done tactfully and elegantly.\\" =Eton College= Holford undertook at least three commissions for Eton College: Villiers House (under construction 1960), Farrers House (1959) and the ceiling of Eton College Chapel (1957). =Berinsfield= In 1960 Holford redesigned part of the former RAF Mount Farm, Oxfordshire to form the new village of Berinsfield. The architectural historian Jennifer Sherwood criticised Holford's plan as \\"an opportunity missed... little more than a huge council estate... with brick semis and terraces of the most dismal kind, sprawled out aimlessly along dreary streets...\\" =Piccadilly Circus= From 1961 Holford presented a series of plans to solve road traffic congestion at Piccadilly Circus, some of which included a raised piazza for pedestrians above the ground-level traffic. This concept was kept alive for the rest of 60s, before eventually being terminated by Sir Keith Joseph and Ernest Marples in 1972. The key reason given was that Holford's scheme only allowed for a 20% increase in traffic, whereas the Government wanted 50%. =Paternoster Square= Holford is particularly noted for his redevelopment plan of the area around St Paul's Cathedral in London which had been devastated by aerial bombardment in The Blitz. Only part of Holford's concept was carried out 1961‚Äì67, foremost the Paternoster Square development between St Paul's churchyard and Newgate Street. Due to the undistinguished design of the individual buildings by other architects and the omission of some of Holford's features, the new Paternoster Square soon became very unpopular. Its presence immediately north of one of the capital's prime tourist attractions was widely considered grim and an embarrassment. A redevelopment competition was launched in 1986 and after numerous changes in plans and architects, the new Paternoster Square was completed in 2003. =Bras√≠lia and Durban= Holford was a sought-after consultant outside the UK. In 1957 he was part of the committee selecting L√∫cio Costa's plan for Bras√≠lia and in 1965‚Äì68 produced reports on the development of Durban in South Africa. =Canberra= In the mid-1950s the Robert Menzies Government of Australia asked Holford to report on the planning and development of Canberra, which had become disorganised due to the Great Depression, World War II and post-war economic stringency. His report led to the creation of the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC), which controlled Canberra's development 1957‚Äì89, when the city as it exists today was created. He also advised extensively on Canberra's planning and this advice was largely accepted by the NCDC and led to the evolution of Canberra into a city of car-based suburbs based on the British New Town concept. One unfortunate legacy is the NCDC's acceptance of his recommendation that the proposed new Parliament House be built on the banks of Lake Burley Griffin, rather than on Capital Hill. In 1978 the Parliament of Australia decided that Parliament House would be built on Capital Hill as proposed by its original planner Walter Burley Griffin. The use of the area that the Parliament House was to occupy under the Holford plan has never been fully resolved.

History tyre removed) SCOA-P wheels were developed in the late 1940s by the Steel Company of Australia Ltd (the P in the acronym standing for F. C. Paynter, who patented the design) in response to Victorian Railways experiencing fatigue problems with conventional spoked wheels. Stronger Boxpok type 'B' wheels had been installed on a number of VR locomotive classes in the late 1940s, but they had the disadvantage of being relatively heavy and also restricted maintenance access to axleboxes, underslung springs, and in some cases boiler washout plugs. Boxpok wheels were proposed for the forthcoming Victorian Railways R class 4-6-4, which had a relatively heavy axle load, but it had been discovered that the use of a Boxpok wheel would make coupling rod pin removal difficult. The SCOA-P wheel was developed to allow the strength of the Boxpok design but also provide the maintenance access of a conventional spoked wheel. Comparative performance The SCOA-P wheel centre of a 73-inch R class driving wheel weighed only , lighter than a Boxpok design of the same diameter and equivalent strength. Using a vertical press, load testing was conducted of the strength and elasticity of the SCOA-P wheel centre against a conventional spoked driving wheel centre of an A2 class locomotive that had the same diameter, but was engineered for a lower axle load).

Plot Jeremy Thatcher knows a thing or two about raising animals‚Äîafter all, his dad is a veterinarian. But after he leaves Mr. Elive's magic shop with a strange marbled egg, it soon becomes clear that this is one pet he wasn't prepared for. How is he supposed to keep a flame-breathing dragon with razor-sharp teeth and an out-of-control appetite in his bedroom? If the playful baby dragon is ever to grow up to become a magnificent beast of myth and legend, it needs Jeremy And though he doesn't know it yet, Jeremy needs a dragon with a strong connection Reviews & Interviews Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher has gained positive reviews. Many people find it fun and refreshing. Kids enjoy it. Yet, some say that there is a fine line between \\"fantasy\\" and \\"reality\\". Kirkus Reviews wrote that it was \\"A funny, enjoyable, imaginative story whose serious undercurrents lend it unexpected depth.\\" According to Christopher Paolini, it also served as inspiration for his book Eragon, as he had loved the story's dragon-hatching storyline. \\"Q: As you know, there has been a lot of social controversy about exposing kids to reality vs. fantasy. What are your thoughts about the social implications of \\"magic\\" in the lives of our children? Is the use of \\"magic\\" in your books just fantasy, just fun? A: Sometimes kids do a much better job at telling the difference between fantasy and reality than a group of adults. Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher has been taken off the shelf in one school district for what they called \\"satanic content\\"‚Äîthe presence of the dragon, the chicken livers, the silver gleam, and the use of black and red colors here and there in the book. It went back on the shelf after a protracted discussion and once I got involved in the issue. But I can't address magic across the spectrum because different people have different feelings about it. I can only say that, for me, fantasy is a way of telling an amusing and engaging story and fantasy fiction sometimes addresses important issues at a deeper level than realistic fiction does. C. S. Lewis said \\"Sometimes the best way to tell the truth is to tell a fairy tale.\\" Awards The Utah's children book award in 1994. \\"Always grab the reader by the throat in the first line,\\" says Bruce Coville, author of \\"Jeremy Thatcher: Dragon Hatcher,\\" winner of the 1994 Utah Children's Book Award. In 1992 Mythopoeic Award Nominated Coville's Jeremy Thatcher Dragon Hatcher for Best Children's Fantasy Literature. Challenges In Iowa, parents challenged Coville's novel because it \\"contained reference to witchcraft and devil worship.\\" Eventually it was proven that there was no references to the devil or witchcraft but the parents thought the mention of silver, red, and black and the symbols of the moon and the stars were all connected to witchcraft and devil worship.

PetroChina Pipelines PetroChina Pipelines is a subsidiary (72.26%) of PetroChina that managed the first three pipelines of the project. =West‚ÄìEast Gas Pipeline I= History The construction of the West‚ÄìEast Gas Pipeline started in 2002. The pipeline was put into trial operation on 1 October 2004, and the full commercial supply of natural gas commenced on 1 January 2005. The pipeline is owned and operated by PetroChina West‚ÄìEast Gas Pipeline Company, a subsidiary of PetroChina. Originally, it was agreed that PetroChina would have owned 50% of the pipeline, while Royal Dutch Shell, Gazprom, and ExxonMobil had been slated to hold 15% each, and Sinopec 5%. However, in August 2004, the Board of Directors of PetroChina announced that following good faith discussions with all parties to the Joint Venture Framework Agreement, the parties had not been able to reach an agreement, and the joint venture framework agreement was terminated. Technical features The long pipeline runs from Lunnan in Xinjiang to Shanghai. The pipeline passes through 66 cities in the 10 provinces in China. Natural gas transported by the pipeline is used for electricity production in the Yangtze River Delta area. There is a plan to replace coal with gas in Shanghai by 2010. The capacity of the pipeline is of natural gas annually. The cost of the pipeline was US$5.7 billion. By the end of 2007, the capacity was planned to be upgraded to . For this purpose, ten new gas compressor stations will be built and eight existing stations are to be upgraded. Connections The West‚ÄìEast Gas Pipeline is connected to the Shaan-Jing pipeline by three branch pipelines. The long Ji-Ning branch between the Qingshan Distributing Station and the Anping Distributing Station became operational on 30 December 2005. Source of supply The pipeline is supplied from the Tarim Basin oil and gas fields in Xinjiang province. The Changqing gas area in Shaanxi province is a secondary gas source. In the future, the planned Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline will be connected to the West‚ÄìEast Gas Pipeline. Starting from 15 September 2009, the pipeline is also supplied with coalbed methane from the Qinshui Basin in Shanxi. =West‚ÄìEast Gas Pipeline II= Construction of the second West‚ÄìEast Gas Pipeline started on 22 February 2008. The pipeline with a total length of , including of the main line and eight sub-lines, will run from Khorgas in northwestern Xinjiang to Guangzhou in Guangdong. Up to Gansu, it will be parallel and interconnected with the first west-east pipeline. The western part of the pipeline is expected to be commissioned by 2009, and the eastern part by June 2011. The capacity of the second pipeline is of natural gas per year. It is mainly supplied by the Central Asia-China gas pipeline. The pipeline is expected to cost US$20 billion. The project is developed by China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corp. (CNODC), a joint venture of China National Petroleum Corporation and PetroChina. =West‚ÄìEast Gas Pipeline III= Construction of the third pipeline started in October 2012 and it is to be completed by 2015. The third pipeline will run from Horgos in western Xinjiang to Fuzhou in Fujian. It will cross Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces. The total length of the third pipeline is , including trunkline and eight branches. In addition, the project includes three gas storages and a LNG plant. It will have a capacity of of natural gas per year with operating pressure of .

Everyman's mission is to bring accessible and affordable theatre to the city of Baltimore. Everyman Theatre is located in downtown Baltimore in the Bromo Arts and Entertainment District. History Founded in 1990 by artistic director Vincent M. Lancisi, Everyman's debut production was The Runner Stumbles in Saint John's Church in Baltimore. For the next few years, Everyman only produced one production per season at various locations throughout the city. In 1995 Everyman finally had their own home in a former bowling alley on Charles Street, and offered yearly subscriptions for the first time. Everyman's first production in their own space was Buried Child by Sam Shepard. In November 2006, Everyman Theatre made the official announcement that it had received a gift of a new home by the Bank of America and The Dawson Company: The Town Theatre, located at 315 West Fayette Street on the West Side of Baltimore City. Everyman‚Äôs new home opened as The Empire in 1910 with vaudeville performances and later hosted Yiddish theatre, boxing, and bingo parties. The original building was designed by Otto Simonson, a local architect, with William H. McElfatrick. In 1937, during its life as The Palace‚Äîa burlesque theatre‚Äîthere was public uproar over the \\"indecency\\" of the performances and the theatre was closed. Shortly thereafter, and as if to ensure the death of its racy past, the theatre was converted to a parking garage. In 1947, the building was redesigned into a 1,550-seat movie house by Baltimore architect John Zink, one of the major East Coast theatre architects of the mid-twentieth century. The Town Theatre, as it was known during this period, had a glittering opening with the now-classic film ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Wonderful Life, ‚Äú which was attended by star Jimmy Stewart and director Frank Capra. By 1990, The Town was in disrepair, closing its doors and remaining a vacant shadow of its former self until it was donated by the Bank of America and The Harold A. Dawson Trust to Everyman Theatre in 2006. Along with the recently restored Hippodrome Theatre and the Bromo Seltzer Arts Tower, the creation of Everyman‚Äôs new home plays an important role in the renaissance of a theatre and arts district in downtown Baltimore‚Äôs Westside. The restoration of the neoclassical terra cotta and granite fa√ßade represents the most historically significant aspect of the renovation.http://everymantheatre.org/theater-history The building, valued at $1.5 million, was renovated to offer sufficient scene shops, costume and props facilities, education space, and a 253 seat state of the art theatre with more room to grow in future years. In January 2013, Everyman celebrated the grand opening of their new theatre with a production of Tracy Letts's August: Osage County. Education Program Everyman Theatre offers a various educational opportunities to people of all ages. The Education Department provides diverse programming, including their highly regarded high school matinee program serving Baltimore City public schools, a Residency Program that brings experiential learning into the classroom, Audience Engagement opportunities and a variety of classes for professional artists, educators and young people. Everyman Education's high school matinee program has operated for fifteen years, and has served a selected number of Baltimore City Public High Schools during that time. The overall goal of the program is to offer students in Baltimore City an opportunity to experience live theatre and to understand the meaning of the plays, the work of the actors, the responsibilities of various theatre designers, and the importance of theatre as a universal art form. During their visit, the students have the opportunity to meet and ask questions of each play's cast and crew. The program brings students to the theatre for multiple performances during the season completely free of charge to the school and students. 25th anniversary season The 2015/2016 season will be Everyman's twenty-fifth in Baltimore. The season will include: *An Inspector Calls *Fences *Outside Mullingar *Under the Skin The season is highlighted by its final two productions: Death of a Salesman and A Streetcar Named Desire, presented in alternating performances in what the theatre calls The Great American Rep. During the rep, Everyman will host a new staged reading series called Women's Voices in Current and Future American Classics, which will be curated and directed by the women of the resident company, and will be performed on Mondays during the rep. Resident artists Everyman has been known in Baltimore for employing a resident company of theatre artists. The Resident Acting Company has transformed and grown over the years.

Krajewski, was a Polish writer and educational activist of the times of the Enlightenment in Poland. His 1784 book Podolanka became the most debated and published Polish novel of that year, and his next book, Wojciech Zdarzy≈Ñski, is considered to be the first Polish science-fiction novel.  Biography  Krajewski (coat of arms Jasie≈Ñczyk) was born in the Rus Voivodeship on 8 September 1746. On 22 July 1763 he joined the order of Piarists in Podoliniec, where he gained the name of Dymitr. After his novitiate he studied rhetoric and philosophy in Miƒôdzyrzecze Koreckie. From 1769 he attended the Piarists college in Warsaw and in 1782 he became a prefect of Collegium Nobilium.

In 1793 he left the priesthood and settled in Ko≈Ñskie. In 1809 he moved to Warsaw, where he joined the Society of Friends of Science (Towarzystwo Przyjaci√≥≈Ç Nauk).  Works  Krajewski's writings concentrated on social issues and political debate about the need to reform the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (along the lines suggested by Jean-Jacques Rousseau). He was the supporter of the reformists idea, especially in the area of the education (like the reforms of the Commission of National Education, first ministry of education in the world). His first book published in 1784 was the Podolanka wychowana w stanie natury, ≈ºycie i przypadki swoje opisujƒÖca (The Podolian Girl: raised in the natural state, describing her life and events), inspired by French book by Henri Joseph Du Laurens (Imirce, ou la fille de la nature).

She made her debut screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 19 June 2006 and was introduced by series producer Bryan Kirkwood as part of the McQueen family. Her storylines have included discovering her son John Paul (James Sutton) was gay, the revenge of her abandoned son Niall (Barry Sloane), which led to the death of her daughter Tina (Leah Hackett), a relationship with Dirk Savage (David Kennedy), faking her own death, and coming to terms with the death of her daughter Carmel (Gemma Merna) following a train crash and the disappearance of her daughter Mercedes (Jennifer Metcalfe). On 1 August 2013, it was announced that Barber-Lane had quit the serial and Myra made her departure during the episode broadcast on 5 September 2013. The character was shot by Dr. Paul Browning (Joseph Thompson), but survived and then emigrated so he thought she was dead. On 31 January 2014, Myra made a brief return to the show following the death of Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell). In July 2014, it was announced that Myra would return again later in the year, but for a longer stint. It was crossed with the return of Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter). Myra returned to the serial on 12 September 2014.http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hol lyoaks/news/a547834/hollyoaks- airs-one-off-return-for-myra-mcqueen.html In January 2015, Barber-Lane took a break from the show, with her return date yet to be confirmed but in a magazine interview Barber-Lane revealed that she currently had no plans to return. Barber-Lane stated that Myra was in the city of Alicante in Spain, visiting daughters, Michaela (Hollie-Jay Bowes) and Jacqui (Claire Cooper). It was announced in October 2015 that Barber-Lane had returned to filming and that Myra would return in November to support her daughter Mercedes after her baby is stillborn, with her Venezuelan boyfriend, Diego Salvador Martinez Hernandez De La Cruz (Juan Pablo Yepez) in tow. In June 2016, Myra discovered that she is pregnant with Diego's baby, her eighth child. On 27 March 2019, Myra left the show again, leaving the village in order to stay with her daughters in Spain . Casting and creation Hollyoaks' executive producer, Lucy Allan said that Myra is not central to storylines as she is not central to the show. She explained that \\"Myra plays a very important role as the mother in the McQueen household\\" but that she would find it \\"abnormal\\" to run a storyline from Myra's perspective. After Barber-Lane lost weight she was asked to put on weight by producers as she \\"didn't look like Myra any more\\". Character development =Characterisation= On Myra, a journalist from Hollyoaks' official website said: \\"Myra McQueen, the mummy bear of Hollyoaks. This formidable matriarch of the village's most fearsome tribe keeps her troublesome brood in line with a mixture of love, understanding and bacon sarnies ‚Äì all three of which have been in great demand during the McQueens dramatic tenure [...] Fiercely protective of her family, Myra's often has to choose between them. [...] when push comes to shove Myra will always put her family first\\". Another journalist for the site added that Myra possesses scepticism, scathing remarks and relentless double standards. They described Myra as the \\"Queen of the McQueen clan\\", saying she is the \\"Mediator of squabbling kids, harbourer of stray relatives, she is the rock which grounds the feral McQueen family through turmoils and tragedies galore\\". They continued that Myra has a \\"feisty, no-nonsense nature\\" before saying that \\"with her trademark gold chains and sovereigns, we'd put our money on Myra over Mr. T any day\\". Barber-Lane described her character's personality saying: \\"She can be quite serious, she can be selfish, she can be loving and giving, she can be ridiculously stupid and she can be amazingly clever - all at the same time! What a woman!\\" On Myra's parenting technique, Barber-Lane said: \\"I think like many mothers, she tries her best. Whether her best is up to scratch is another question. She's certainly a very lenient parent, but also she would do anything for her kids, that comes before anything else\\". Claire Cooper, who plays Myra's daughter, Jacqui, also commented on Myra's role in the family, explaining that although Jacqui often adopts a maternal approach in the McQueen family Myra is always \\"the boss\\" in the family. She added that both characters possess a \\"matriarch feel\\" and if the family had to face a big problem, then Myra would be the one to deal with it rather than Jacqui. The character has had numerous failed relationships in her life with the fathers of her children, Martin, Billy, Marvin and Ricky. Barber-Lane described Myra's relationships stating: \\"She's always fallen for the bad guy, the ones that aren't good for her. They're the ones who give her a challenge along with a bit of fun and excitement. She always believes in true love, though. That's why she constantly gets hurt\\". Barber-Lane went on to express her interest in introducing one of the fathers of her children, saying: \\"I'd love for one of the kids' dads to come back, I really would. We've seen one of them already [...] but there was no interaction with Myra\\". =Niall's revenge= Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood announced that a \\"tall stranger\\", Niall Rafferty (Barry Sloane), would soon join the serial and \\"the McQueen family take him into their bosom ‚Äì Myra's to be precise\\". He explained that the character is Myra's son who she was forced to give up when she was young. Kirkwood added that the storyline would be \\"the big storyline\\" of the year as Niall \\"wreaks revenge\\" on the family. During the storyline Myra's children begin to disappear making her \\"panic\\" upon the realisation. Barber-Lane told Kris Green of entertainment website Digital Spy that Myra no longer wants to look for her son as \\"she thinks that she's a bad omen. All the bad things that have happened to her, she believes, happened because she gave her son away. However, by trying to find her son, she's being punished in different ways with her other kids. The Catholic guilt kicks in and she feels that it's all her fault. She decides that if she tries to find her son, she'll take him away from the white picket fence and the lovely life that she's created for him in her head. As far as she's concerned, she thinks that he's in a beautiful home, with a lovely mum and dad that are probably lawyers or doctors. That's why she really believes that she did the right thing giving him up when she was young\\". Niall lures Myra to the church she left Niall at when she abandoned him at. Niall \\"stuns\\" Myra by grabbing her and showing her the step she abandoned him on as a baby. Myra is \\"completely confused\\" by Niall's actions but \\"it slowly starts to dawn on her, especially when she sees the rest of her family in the church\\". Barber-Lane explained that Niall decides to play one last game with the family and tells that he is \\"going to wipe them out\\". Niall decides that he will ask Myra questions and for every one of his questions that Myra answers correctly she can choose one of her children to live. Barber-Lane added that it is \\"really traumatic\\" experience for Myra. Myra answers all but two questions correctly and must choose out of her six children which two can live. Myra is told that if she fails to make a decision all of her children will die. Barber-Lane commented that for \\"a mother, that's such a ridiculously difficult decision. She does choose, though - that's something that comes back to haunt her\\". Myra chooses Jacqui and Carmel (Gemma Merna) to die, when John-Paul (James Sutton) and Mercedes (Jennifer Metcalfe) volunteer to die. The church exploded and Tina (Leah Hackett) is killed. Barber-Lane explained that Myra \\"can't forgive herself\\" for choosing Jacqui and Carmel to die. She added that the family dynamics changed when Myra made this choice. Barber-Lane said that Jacqui is less responsive to Myra and she became stronger than Myra who is \\"constantly riddled with guilt\\". She concluded that Myra now lets her children \\"get away with a lot more things than they usually would\\" because of her guilt. =Family= On her time on the serial Myra has often become involved in her family member's storylines. In one storyline Bart McQueen (Jonny Clarke) steals money from Myra. Bart lies about stealing the money when he is accused by Jacqui. This causes tensions between Jacqui and Myra who has \\"had enough of Jacqui muscling in\\". On her characters reasons for not believing Jacqui, Barber-Lane explained that \\"When Myra stopped believing Jacqui, I think it was also partly because Jacqui had hid all the stuff about Theresa (Jorgie Porter) killing Calvin (Ricky Whittle) and it was Myra's way of saying, 'Listen - this is my house, my rules'. Maybe she was wrong, but Bart's 15 so she felt that she couldn't kick him out as he had nowhere else to go, and she just thought that Jacqui should behave herself!\\" Jacqui is later raped by Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan). Barber-Lane explained that there is a \\"part of Myra that thought, 'You'd never let that happen - how have you let that happen? Have you just changed your mind afterwards?\\" Mercedes lies she is pregnant to cover up her affair with Carl Costello (Paul Opacic), the father of her fianc√© Riley Costello (Rob Norbury). Myra discovers her lies and believes that Mercedes should not tell the truth as Mercedes has \\"landed on her feet\\" with Riley. Barber-Lane told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Myra believes Riley will benefit the McQueen family financially and take them out of the poverty they are in. Myra is getting \\"carried away\\" with excitement and enthusiasm over how her life could change due to Riley. She said that the most important thing for Myra is what is important for her daughters although \\"sometimes she may forget that for a moment, but she's always there for her kids\\". Storylines Myra starts a casual relationship with Leo Valentine (Brian Bovell), she then discovers she has caught pubic lice from him. Tina and Russ Owen (Stuart Manning) both catch them after sharing her towel. This causes issues with their respective partners Dominic Reilly (John Pickard) and Mercedes until Myra admits she introduced them. Myra spends New Year's Eve 2007 with Leo, they become drunk and engage in sexual activity. Leo's ex-girlfriend, Valerie Holden (Jacqueline Leonard/Samantha Giles) becomes jealous and attempts to ruin their romance. Myra's son, Niall arrives in the village. She gave him up at birth and he lies about his identity. It soon becomes apparent that he is after revenge on the McQueens. Myra disapproves of Tina acting as a surrogate for Jacqui and Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard). She begs her not to make the same mistake she made in giving her child away. Niall causes trouble for Myra's family by reporting Myra for benefit fraud, injecting Myra's daughter, Michaela (Hollie-Jay Bowes), with heroin, pushing Tina down the stairs and attacking Myra's mother, Marlena \\"Nana\\" McQueen (Diane Langton). Myra makes a friend in priest Kieron Hobbs (Jake Hendriks), who comes to stay with her. They become good friends and Myra is hurt to discover Kieron has a secret relationship with her son, John Paul. She asks Kieron to track down Matthew, the son she gave up. Kieron manages to find his adoptive mother and is shocked to learn it is Niall. When he confronts Niall, he drugs him and kills him to stop him from revealing his identity. Niall kidnaps all of the McQueens and takes them to the church where Myra abandoned him. He lures Myra to the church and reveals the truth. He then asks Myra six questions. For every right answer one of her children lives and for every wrong answer one dies. She only answers two questions right and has to choose which two of her six children gets to live. Mercedes and John Paul sacrifice themselves leaving Myra to choose among the rest. She chooses Tina and Michaela, meaning Carmel and Jacqui have to die. When help arrives, Niall detonates the explosives he has rigged the church with. Jacqui refuses to help Myra out of the rubble. Niall saves her after she tells him that she always loved and thought about him. Myra is devastated to discover Tina has died in the explosion and that Niall has (supposedly) committed suicide. Afterwards, Jacqui cannot forgive her for her actions, but Carmel does. Myra's niece, Theresa moves in with her. She then develops an unwelcome crush on Mike Barnes (Tony Hirst) and later sleeps with Archie Carpenter (Stephen Beard). When her sister Kathleen McQueen (Alison Burrows) arrives comes to see Theresa, Myra lets her stay for Theresa's sake. Kathleen uses Tina's old credit cards for money, when Myra finds out she forces Theresa to choose between her mum and relatives, Theresa chooses her relatives. Theresa shoots Calvin dead. The rest of the family keep it a secret from Myra, when she eventually discovers the truth she is hurt that no one told her. Myra's cousin Victor agrees to let his son Bart live with Myra, after his wife dies. Myra saves the life of Alistair Longford (Terence Harvey), a rich pensioner. He assumes Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) has saved him and gives her money. Cindy becomes engaged to him, so Myra and Jacqui blackmail her for money and the role of her wedding planners. The money is later stolen and Jacqui accuses Bart. Myra defends him and Jacqui tells Myra she will move out if she doesn't believe her. She sides with Bart and loses Jacqui. Myra agrees to let the Savage family live with them after they squat in her home. She becomes close to Dirk Savage (David Kennedy) and the pair have a casual relationship. When Mercedes becomes engaged to footballer Riley she immediately takes a liking to his rich background, to the dismay of his mother Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy) who Myra feuds with over the wedding. Myra discovers Mercedes' affair with Riley's father, Carl. She keeps the affair secret and helps Mercedes continue to lie when she pretends she is pregnant. When Riley causes Mercedes to fall, Myra lies that Mercedes is having a miscarriage. Mercedes discovers she is really pregnant and Myra joins Mercedes and Michaela in Ibiza for her hen party. On the day of Mercedes' wedding to Riley, Myra walks Mercedes down the aisle. At the altar, Mercedes confesses after feeling guilty that she had a four-month affair with Riley's father Carl, and that she isn't sure if the baby she is carrying is his or Riley's. Riley doesn't marry Mercedes and ends their relationship, disgusted that she would cheat on him. Mercedes tells everyone that she needs some time to clear her head, and therefore she plans to travel to Dubai on their honeymoon alone. Mercedes is kidnapped by serial killer Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle). Silas texts Myra pretending to be Mercedes saying she is fine. Myra becomes concerned when Mercedes fails to contact her, but is reassured by Theresa who tells her that Mercedes will call when she is feeling better. Silas is arrested and Mercedes' ring is found amongst the possessions of his victims. Myra is stunned when it is revealed that Silas, who kidnapped Mercedes when she was seven-months pregnant, murdered Heidi. Myra is upset at Mercedes' ordeal. As a result, she begins to show Mercedes how much she loves her by helping her out with her newborn son, Bobby McQueen. Bart begins growing cannabis for Joel Dexter (Andrew Still). The police discover this and Bart runs away. Realising Bart could have a career if he did not have a criminal record Myra claims the drugs are hers. Myra is sent to prison for 6 months. Mercedes visits Myra who warns her not to do anything stupid when she realises Mercedes could hurt Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton). Myra disowns Mercedes after she uncovers that Mercedes stabbed herself and has been released. Mercedes' ex-lover Dr. Paul Browning (Joseph Thompson) returns following being released from prison, found innocent of the murder of Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan), and reunites with her, later getting engaged. Doctor Browning fakes Myra's medical tests, in order that she might reconcile her relationship with Mercedes, and she becomes under the impression that she is dying. Doctor Browning accidentally puts a medical record under Myra's name which states she is pregnant. When Mercedes sees this, she tells Dirk that Myra is pregnant with his baby. Dirk then proposes to Myra, only for Myra to admit that she is terminally ill and not pregnant. Myra later agrees to marry Dirk, and takes out a loan of several thousand pounds for the wedding. Doctor Browning later informs her that she has no \\"shadow\\". Myra decides she wants to sue the hospital, so that she might pay back her loan, but Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell) later tells her that it is not a case worth pursuing.

It is later revealed that it was Jim who was sending the messages, still unknown to Doctor Browning. Thinking she had sent them, he attacked her in the florist's where she worked. Myra survived the attack, but she now starts a hate campaign on Doctor Browning by throwing fliers around the whole village labelling him a murderer. Doctor Browning decides to hire Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) to kill her. Myra still survives, and now knowing that someone is out to kill her, she decides to flee Chester. Jim arranges a boat to get her away from those trying to kill her. However, as she was waiting at the docks, Doctor Browning showed up with a gun, and after a heated argument, Myra was shot and fell into the water. She was presumed dead, until John Paul follows Jim to the airport, where it was revealed she was wearing a bullet proof vest and is alive, however, she must flee so Doctor Browning will be locked away for the crime. John Paul promises to keep their encounter a secret and watches on as Myra leaves forever. Myra makes a brief return, reuniting herself with the rest of the McQueens. She reveals that she is now living with Jacqui in Spain and can never return to the village as she would be arrested for faking her death. In 2014, when Mercedes fills Myra in on what they have discovered about Carmel's fianc√©e, Sonny Valentine (Aaron Fontaine), Myra hatches a plan to make Carmel realise what he is like. Myra is devastated when John Paul tells her he was raped by Finn O'Connor (Keith Rice), and vows to help him through it. When Nana and Mercedes tell Myra to go back to Spain, she tells them that her family need her, and she is not going anywhere until the McQueens are safe. Myra later visits Trevor, who threatens her. She visits The Hutch to see John Paul who had got engaged to Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) who wants her blessing, and she runs into Frankie Osborne (Helen Pearson), and food falls onto Frankie. Myra doesn't want to be seen by Frankie who then spots her. She makes a quick escape, and later gives Ste her blessing for him to marry John Paul. Myra, Phoebe and Mercedes hatch a plan to get rid of Sonny for good, and they force him into a car with a toy gun. They park the car by a lake, and as Myra, Phoebe and Mercedes discuss what their next plan is, Myra realises that she has left the handbrake on and the trio watch helplessly as the car and Sonny roll into the water. They confess all to Carmel, who is furious and contemplates telling the police. Myra, Phoebe and Mercedes manage to convince Carmel against the idea, but when they go to pay their respects to Sonny at the lake, they look on in horror as the police are pulling the car out of the water. Carmel later reveals to Mercedes, Myra and Phoebe that Sonny was not found in the car, and he is now a missing person. During Finn's trial, Myra becomes enemies with Finn's stepmother Diane O'Connor (Alex Fletcher), after Myra discovers that Diane is intending to lie for Finn in court. When Diane is later attacked in The Hutch, she believes it was one of the McQueens after an argument with Myra, but it was in fact Ste who was robbing the restaurant for money. When is transpires that Ste robbed The Hutch and attacked Diane to buy drugs, Myra is disgusted and tries to keep Ste away from John Paul, but Ste convinces Myra to allow him to speak to John Paul. Myra finds out that Diane's stepdaughter Sinead O'Connor (Stephanie Davis) had been having an affair with Tony. Myra wants Diane to suffer and vows to make her find out. John Paul takes the camera which had recorded Sinead and Tony to Diane. John Paul returns a few minutes later and smashes the camera. Myra then helps Carmel to get Phoebe's mobile phone to the police which holds a confession that Sonny had said to the McQueen's in order to free Theresa from prison. Theresa is later freed and she goes into labour. Myra then helps Theresa to hospital and helps her give birth to Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen.

They disown her, and Myra is disgusted in her daughter. Sonny sneaks aboard the train and attacks Phoebe and Theresa, before Sienna Blake's (Anna Passey) car on the tracks causes it to derail. Carmel frees Theresa from Sonny's clutches in the wreckage just before it explodes, and Myra and the rest of the McQueens are devastated when Carmel dies due to injuries sustained in the explosion. Myra clashes with Mercedes in the aftermath of Carmel's death, due to Mercedes believing Theresa ruined Carmel's life and Myra disagreeing. Myra picks Theresa over Mercedes, and Mercedes is left out on the streets whilst the rest of the family grieve for Carmel. Mercedes shows up drunk at Carmel's funeral and starts bringing up incidents from the past where the family hurt Carmel, when Mercedes starts to insult Carmel Myra tells Mercedes that she's done nothing but bring shame on the family and that it should be her in Carmel's coffin, Mercedes storms out in distress. Later that night, Mercedes is supposedly \\"murdered\\" by an unknown assailant. The next day, Phoebe calls the police concerned about Mercedes whereabouts and when the police detective notices blood on the kitchen floor the house is turns into a crime scene and a murder investigation is launched. Myra starts to fall into a depression after the death of Carmel and apparent death of Mercedes. She was later shocked that John Paul was engagement with Ste, which makes her angry and never wanted him to get married with him, and afraid that it will be like Mercedes late husband Paul Browning. Several weeks later she decides to go to Alicante to see Jacqui and attempt to work through her pain and weeks later is joined by Nana. Myra returns in November 2015, after Theresa informs her about the stillbirth of Mercedes' son, Gabriel. Mercedes apologises to Myra for faking her death, and Myra forgives her. She is also reunited with her youngest sister Reenie (Z√∂e Lucker), who she is close to. The day after her return, a young Venezuelan man named Diego Salvador Martinez Hernandez De La Cruz (Juan Pablo Yepez) arrives in Hollyoaks searching for the \\"Countess of Chester\\". It transpires that he is Myra's boyfriend, after lying to him that she is the ruler of Chester and is 38 years of age. The pair reconcile and he moves in with the McQueens. She is disgusted to learn that Reenie's husband Pete Buchanan (Kai Owen) has been sexually abusing her teenage niece Cleo McQueen (Nadine Rose Mulkerrin), and comforts Reenie when she reveals that she too was repeatedly raped as a child by Nana's abusive ex-partner, Derek Clough (Bruce Montague). In March 2016, Myra is furious to learn that John Paul's transgender boss, Sally St. Claire (Annie Wallace), has sacked him, so behind his back she confronts her. However, she recognises Sally as her ex-boyfriend, Iain Naismith, who is also John Paul's father. She is adamant not to allow Sally to reveal her identity to John Paul, and after a heated argument, Sally agrees that it is for the best not to say anything. When the truth comes out during a showdown with Pete, John Paul refuses to speak to Myra or Sally. However, he slowly warms to Sally when he finds and reads a letter from her which should have been given to him when he was a child, and becomes more hostile towards Myra for withholding it. She later demands that Sally pay for all the years of child maintenance that she missed out on for John Paul, which Sally agrees to but Myra storms off. When Sally catches up with her, she attacks Sally, which results in Myra falling down the stairs at the school. She is rushed to hospital, and it transpires that Sally pushed Myra down the stairs in self-defence. Celine McQueen (Sarah George) then breaks the news to Myra that she is pregnant with Diego's baby. Myra later gives birth to a girl called Carmina Celeste, named after her late daughters Tina and Carmel and her niece Celine, who was recently murdered.

It is also called a wetland under the Ramsar Convention which has listed the lake in November 2002, as a Ramsar Site for undertaking conservation measures on the basis of its biological and environmental importance.Ramsor sites Considered as one of the largest beels in the Brahmaputra valley of Lower Assam, it is categorised as representative of the wetland type under the Burma monsoon forest biogeographic region.http://envfor.nic.in/divisions/csurv/Wetland%20Inventory.pdf Wet Land Inventory.pdf, Deepor Beel, pages 195-202 The Dipor Bil is reported to provide, directly or indirectly, its natural resources for the livelihood of fourteen indigenous villages (1,200 families) located in its precincts.http://www.globalresponse.org/gra.php?i=1/08 Protect Wetland Bird Paradise/India Freshwater fish is a vital protein and source of income for these communities; the health of these people is stated to be directly dependent on the health of this wetland ecosystem. A member of Deepor Beel Fishermen‚Äôs Cooperative Society has succinctly stated: \\"Our forefathers protected this wetland and we are committed to do the same as we depend on the wetland for our livelihood. We will protect this wetland at any cost and against any odds\\". Etymology The name Deepor Beel is stated to be derivative of the Sanskrit word dipa which means elephant, -r means \\"of\\" and bil means wetland or large aquatic body in Assamese language, inhabited by elephants.http://wikimapia.org/2889727/Deepor-Beel Deepor beel History It is claimed that beel was an important dockyard of the Tai-Ahom as well as the Mughals. The medieval history reports of Ahom-Mughal conflicts. It is also stated that Kampitha and Rambrai Syiemship (the supreme political authority is known as the Syiemship in Meghalaya).List of Political Parties in the state had control over this area. Access On the way to Deepor Beel in Guwahati, Assam It is located 13 km South West of Guwahati on the National Highway (NH. 31), on the Jalukbari-Khanapara bypass, alongside its north western boundary. PWD road skirts the northern fringe of the Rani and Garbhanga Reserve Forests on the south. The National Highway 37 borders the beel on the east and north- east and the Assam Engineering College Road on the north. Also, minor roads and tracts exist in the vicinity of the beel. The beel is about 5 km from the Guwahati Airport (LGB Int. Airport). A broad gauge railway line skirts the lake. Topography and geology The beel is bounded by the steep highlands on the north and south, and the valley formed has a broad U-shape with the Rani and Garbhanga hills forming the backdrop.https://www.indianjungles.com/160405c.htm The geologic and tectonic history of the region provide the links to the hydrology and channel dynamics of rivers and pattern, and intensity of land use in the area. It is commonly stated that the beel together with those adjoining it are an abandoned channel of the Brahmaputra system. While the beel and its lowland fringe are said to be underlaid by recent alluvium consisting of clay, silt, sand and pebbles, the highlands immediately to the north and south of the beel are made up of gneisses and schists of the Archaean age. Hydrology The Basistha and Kalmani rivers and local monsoon run-off are the main sources of water to the lake, between May and September. Khonajan channel drains the beel into the Brahmaputra river, 5 km to the north. It acts as a natural stormwater reservoir during the monsoon season for the Guwahati city (stated to be the only major storage water basin for the city‚Äôs drainage, with about four metres depth of water during monsoon dropping to about one metre during the dry season. The beel has a perennial water spread area of about 10.1 km2, which extends up to 40.1 km2 during floods.Evidence of biological degradation in sediments of Deepor Beel However, an area of 414 ha has been declared as \\"Deepor Beel Sanctuary\\" by the Government of Assam. As per a Remote Sensing Study the wetland area is reported to have reduced to 14.1% (405 ha) from 1990 to 2002. Temperatures in the beel vary from 10.60 to 320C. During the winter months, when the size of the lake reduces in area by about fifty percent, the shore area (up to one kilometre) is cultivated with rice paddy when the climate is also relatively cool and dry. The tropical monsoon climate prolongs from May to September when it is humid. Pre-monsoon showers are experienced between March and May.  Flora  Deciduous forest within the beel basin -- Tectona grandis-the common teak Euryale ferox -- giant water lily in the beel The hydrophytic vegetation of the beel has been classified, based on ecological adaptation, into the following categories with their floristic elements.Save Deepor Beel Now or Never by Indrajit Dutta These are: * Aquatic vegetation like Giant Water Lily, water hyacinth, aquatic grasses, water lilies and other submerged, emergent and floating vegetation are found during the summer season. * In the dry areas, during winter, aquatic and semi-aquatic vegetation are seen * In deep open water area, marshy lands, mud flat, emergent vegetation, water hyacinth patches, net-grass land patches are reported * Migratory water-fowl, residential water-fowl and terrestrial avifauna are common in paddy field areas, dry grassland areas and scattered forest areas. A total of 18 genera of phytoplankton are reported from the core area of the beel ecosystem out of which species of Oscilatoria and Microcystis are dominant. List of aquatic plants identified in the beel are: * Eichhornia crassipes, Pistia stratiotes, Ottelia alismoides, Lemna minor, Potamogeton crispus, Vallisneria spiralis, Hydrilla verticillata, Ipomoea reptans, Azolla pinnata, Spirodela polyrhiza, Eleocharis plantaginea, Nymphaea alba, Euryale ferox, Nymphaea rubra and Sagittaria sagittifolia. * Euryale ferox, a giant water lily with edible seeds, are leased to earn revenue for the government. Other lake shore vegetation include: * Eupatorium adoratum, Achyranthes aspera, Cyperus esculentus, Phragmites karka, Vitex trifolia, Accium basilium, Saccharum spontaneum and Imperata arundinacea. Dominant tree species in the nearby Deciduous forests in the beel basin are species of Tectona grandis or common teak, Ficus benghalensis, Shorea robusta and Bombax malabaricum. In the surrounding forest area, aquarium plants, medicinal plant and orchids of commercial value are reported.  Avifauna  The beel is a natural habitat to many varieties of birds. 219 species of birds including more than 70 migratory species are reported in the beel area. The largest congregations of aquatic birds can be seen, particularly in winter, with a reported recorded count of 19,000 water birds in a day. Some of the globally threatened species of birds like spotbilled pelican (Pelecanus philippensis), lesser adjutant stork (Leptoptilos javanicus), Baer‚Äôs pochard (Aythya baeri), Pallas' sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster), greater adjutant stork (Leptoptilos dubius). Spot- billed pelican found in beels and lakes in India Among the large number of migratory water fowl, the Siberian crane (Grus leucogeranus) regularly migrates to this habitat during its annual journey. This is in addition to the large congregation of residential water birds seen in the lake. Considering the richness of the bird varieties found in the beel, the BirdLife International has declared Deepor Beel as an Important Bird Area (IBA) with high priority for conservation.  Aqua fauna  Surveys have revealed 20 amphibians, 12 lizards, 18 snakes and 6 turtle and tortoise species in the beel. Over 50 commercially viable species of fish, belonging to 19 families have been identified, which supplies stock to other nearby wetlands and rivers. The beel provides food, acts as a spawning and nursery water body; some of the species breed within the beel. Land fauna Wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), leopard, jungle cat and the protected barking deer, Chinese porcupine and sambar are found in the beel. Herds of elephants are reported in the beel. Utility of the beel The inhabitants around the villages located in the periphery and the catchment of the beel use the beel for: * Fishing * As a waterway for transporting the villagers of the southern boundary to the N.H. 37 * Collect fodder for domestic cattle and collect aquatic seeds such as giant water lily, Nymphea sp. etc. * Raise boro paddy ‚Äì sown in December‚ÄìJanuary and harvested in April‚ÄìMay  Deterioration of the beel  Natural and anthropogenic causes for the deterioration of the beel are many. The major reasons reported in the beel ecosystem are.: * Proliferation of human settlements, roads, and industries around the periphery (in the eastern and north-eastern sides) causing pollution problems.. * Waste water from different parts of the city and the adjoining areas * Construction of broad- gauge railway line on the periphery of the beel * Allottment of the government vacant land to private party by Government settlement department * Brick kilns and soil cutting * Hunting, trapping and killing of wild birds and mammals * Unplanned intensive fishing practices (both during day and night) * Pamohi garbage dumping site adjoining the Dipor Bil Restoration activities A comprehensive management plan has been set in motion and it is proposed to notify the whole beel area as a protected area. Weeds have been removed in an area of 500 ha and the fish catch is reported to be improving. The long term measures envisaged to preserve the beel environment are: *Encroachments and settlements around the beel periphery to be eliminated *Train stops on the boundary of the beel to be discontinued *To raise suitable plantations on either side of the railway line to reduce noise level *Eco-restoration of surrounding forest area *To preserve effectiveness of the beel as storm water detention basin for Guwahati city and creation of additional storage capacity in the naturally depressed areas within the greater metropolitan area *Guwahati city runoff, which includes sewage, to be treated before discharging into the beel *To discontinue land cutting, Brick Kilns and industrial development in the periphery of the beel *Government settlements to be discontinued and the beel to be preserved to its natural state *Encourage bird related eco-tourism and conservation education. =Bird sanctuary= Deepor Beel Bird Sanctuary covering an area of 414 ha within the larger spread of the beel to shelter several species of birds has been created by the Department of Forests, Assam, and shooting and bird-trapping are prohibited by law, but enforcement is reported to be inadequate. Over 120 species of birds have been listed in the sanctuary, including kingfishers, fishing eagles, adjutant storks and abundant varieties of ducks.Deepor Beel Bird Sanctuary, Guwahati A watch tower has been erected on the bank of the beel for bird watching and security purpose.  Public participation  While the management authority for the beel is the Forest Department of the Government of Assam, with the Fisheries Department as the functional Authority, several public and private institutions and universities are involved in creating the awareness of the Ecological importance of the beel and the need to restore it to its original status. Some important ones are: * The Ramsar Convention, which has recognised the Deepor Beel in its list of 1782 wetland sites, with 158 contracting parties to the convention of the world and holds seminars to create awareness of the beel‚Äôs uniqueness.http://www.ramsar.org The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands * Aaranyak, a non-governmental organization set up \\"to foster conservation of biodiversity in Northeast India through research, environmental education, capacity building and advocacy for legal and policy reform to usher a new era of ecological security\\" is actively involved in Community Based Conservation Projects, which includes among other projects the \\"Deepar Beel Community Conservation Project\\".Deepar Beel Community Conservation Project The project was designed \\"to reduce the anthropogenic pressure on the wetland by providing for alternative and diversified means of livelihood to the people living along the fringe villages.

WFOB is licensed to Fostoria, Ohio, which is located in Wood, Seneca, and Hancock counties. History WFOB first went on the air in 1952, and was the third radio station to go on the air serving this immediate area, eleven years after the premiere of WFIN in Findlay, Ohio; the seat of government for Hancock County. At the time, there was no AM radio station on the air serving Seneca and Wood Counties. Its FM sister, WFOB-FM, had been on the air since 1946, but because of its low power and the lack of FM radio receivers available at the time, it would be decades more before it would thrive. For many years, WFOB operated from its transmitter site at 1407 U.S. Route 23 just south of Fostoria, but would move to its present location at 101 North Main Street in downtown Fostoria by 1990. WFOB and WBVI transmitter site, at 1407 U.S. Route 23, south of Fostoria. This building had served as the WFOB and WBVI studios and offices for many years prior to the downtown move. WFOB and WBVI studios and offices, at 101 North Main Street, Fostoria Seneca Radio Corporation, which was the station's original owner, had decided to sell WFOB AM & FM in 1986. Tri-County Broadcasting, also known as TCB Holdings, purchased WFOB and its sister station, WBVI. TCB Chairman Donald P. Miller, was also president of Roppe Corporation, known for its rubber products, particularly for matting staircases in office buildings and other commercial dwellings. Miller, a loyal Fostorian, purchased the station to assure the community that the mission of WFOB and WBVI would continue to be that of a \\"community first\\" radio station, and not turn its back on its community roots to serve Toledo or other area outside of its licensed community. Under TCB's direction, WFOB thrived more than ever before, thanks to constant re-investment in the station, as technology continued to evolve over the years. Vinyl records and magnetic tape would be replaced by CDs, satellite technology and computer hard-disk audio storage, thus reducing periodic maintenance costs. WFOB's constant presence in the community from its local news coverage and broadcasting of special events further bolstered its position as a full-service station serving Seneca, Wood and Hancock Counties. =The power increase that wasn't= In 1989, WFOB listeners were able to hear their local radio station at a much greater distance. Prior to this time, WFOB's signal transmission would barely be heard in the Toledo city limits, due to the presence of another radio station, WBRB, broadcasting from the Detroit suburb of Mount Clemens, Michigan on the same channel and with the same power and an almost identical antenna pattern propagation. WBRB, having been in financial difficulty for some time, fell silent in 1989. Attempts to find a buyer for the bankrupt station proved futile, and that station was silenced for good after competitor Walter Wolpin (who owned WCAR in Livonia) purchased the license and assets in a 1992 bankruptcy court sale, returning the license to the FCC, with its towers being dismantled the following year, and the razing of its studio building not long after that. After WBRB went off the air, WFOB's signal, no longer inhibited by WBRB, could be heard clearly in the Detroit Metropolitan Area except where adjacent channel interference from AM 1440 WMKM in the Detroit suburb of Inkster was too great. WFOB serves both Fostoria and Bowling Green, the county seat of Wood County, and once was the home of Bowling Green State University. To better serve the listeners of Bowling Green, TCB built a second studio facility for WFOB on the second floor of a building in downtown Bowling Green. This studio was manned by its own news director, who would also break in with local news and sports from the Wood County area, and also serve as a satellite sales office for reps selling WFOB and WBVI airtime in this area. Transmissions were made from this studio to the main Fostoria facility via FM STL microwave. WFOB today WFOB continued into the beginning of the twenty- first century as a full-service news, weather, sports and music station, with the music being a blend of Adult Contemporary and Oldies. The station eventually used ABC Radio's Memories and then Timeless Favorites programming during some day parts. WFOB on Monday, September 1, 2008 dropped all music programming and began broadcasting ESPN Radio. It also aired local news, weather and sports such as the Cleveland Indians and Cleveland Browns. (It had held the local broadcasting rights to the Indians, Browns, and Ohio State University football and basketball prior to the switch.) On June 1, 2009, WFOB switched to Sporting News Radio and also added The Dan Patrick Show to its lineup along with reinstating a live weekday morning show originating from Fostoria. The morning show is hosted was Josh Hohman and Vic Travagliante (www.wfob.com/mornings) . WFOB also provides local sports programming, including local high school football and basketball along with local shows such as \\"The Sports Huddle\\" hosted by Vic Travagliante and \\"Scoreboard Show\\" hosted by Burley Stapley, Brian Cooper and Shannon Miller during the football season and Vic Travagliante & Josh Hohman during the basketball season. WFOB broadcasts professional sports including the Cleveland Indians, Cleveland Cavaliers, Toledo Mud Hens and Cleveland Browns as well as the Ohio State University (Football, Men's & Women's Basketball) WFOB was also one of the first stations in the country to invest in AM stereo technology. The FCC didn't adopt a standard for AM Stereo until 1993. Following the lead of other stations who had given up on it, WFOB dropped its AM stereo transmission in 2005. WFOB has enjoyed a long history of tenured personnel over the years such as Kevin Kriss, Burley Stapley, Mike Fry, and John Conlin. Donald and Judy Miller currently oversee the operation of the station. WFOBsports.com is the station's online source for high school sports in the Hancock, Wood and Seneca County region, and generally broadcasts football and basketball. During the fall, WFOBsports.com consists of an online portal, where every Friday night, and many Saturdays as well, local high school sports can be heard through the calls of Trevor Newby, the voice of WFOBsports.com. On August 1, 2011, Sporting News Radio changed its branding to become Yahoo! Sports Radio. WFOB changed along with the network to be known as WFOB 1430- Yahoo! Sports Radio. On August 5, 2015, WFOB became again ESPN Radio 1430 WFOB. The station continues to carry Cleveland Indians, Cleveland Browns, Cleveland Cavaliers, Ohio State Buckeyes, Toledo Mudhens and Fostoria Redmen, along with other area high schools, sporting events. In 2016, Lance Morris was hired as sports director, ushering in a new era at WFOB. The tenure was marked by a shift to younger on-air talent. The Psych-up and Scoreboard shows were anchored by Brendan Hall and Chase Bachman in 2018. Bachman returned for the next two seasons to host the program with Shayne Nissen.

H. Spring, USNR, in command. In November 1944, Mellette followed a San Pedro shakedown cruise with a voyage to the Hawaiian Islands for training operations. She conducted amphibious troop, gunnery, and tactical exercises off Maui into January 1945. On 27 January she joined TG 51.1 and got underway for Iwo Jima. With units of the 4th Marine Division embarked, she steamed west, via Eniwetok and Saipan, arriving off the Volcano Islands to participate in the initial assault 19 February. She remained off the eastern beaches of Iwo Jima for the next 6 days, unloading supplies and taking on casualties. On the 25th she sailed for Saipan where she disembarked her wounded passengers and began preparations for the upcoming Okinawa campaign. Through the next month Mellette trained off Tinian's western beaches with TG 51.2 and on 27 March weighed anchor and headed for the Ryukyus. On 1 April she was off Okinawa and at 0631 commenced disembarking units of the 2d Marine Division in diversionary landings along the island's southeastern coast. Her mission completed by mid‚Äëmorning, she reembarked her Marines and sailed to the main assault area to stand by until needed. There she remained until ordered back to Saipan on the 11th. She disembarked the Marines at Saipan on the 14th and remained there until 4 June when she began carrying men and cargo among the Marianas and Solomons. In July she carried reinforcements, the Army's 24th Infantry Regiment, to Kerama Retto. Back at Saipan when the Japanese capitulation was announced, 15 August, Mellette immediately took on men of the 6th Marine Division and sailed for Honsh≈´. Arriving with the first wave of occupation troops, she disembarked the Marines at Yokosuka Naval Base on the 30th, witnessed official surrender in Tokyo Bay 2 September, and then returned to Saipan to take on men of the 2d Marine Division for transportation to Nagasaki. Next assigned to ‚ÄúMagic Carpet‚Äù duty, she completed two voyages between the western Pacific and Seattle before 21 January 1946 when she got underway for the east coast and inactivation. Arriving at Norfolk, Virginia, 3 February, she decommissioned 25 June and entered the Reserve Fleet at Yorktown, Virginia. Korean War era With the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, Mellette was reactivated, recommissioning 18 October 1950. For the next 4 years she operated primarily along the east coast, participating in fleet operations and exercises from Nova Scotia to the Caribbean. During that period she served with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean 8 September 1953 to 4 February 1954. Fate She decommissioned 18 June 1955 and joined the Charleston, South Carolina, group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Berthed at Charleston for the next 5 years, she was transferred to the National Defense Reserve Fleet in June 1960.

Foudroyant was built in the dockyard at Plymouth Dock (a.k.a. Devonport) and launched on 31 March 1798.Goodwin (p.179) gives the launch date for Foudroyant as 31 March, 25 May, and 31 August. The text highlights this discrepancy and attributes the August date to Lyon's Sailing Navy List, published in 1993. Dates given for commissioning and other movements, which are taken from the ship's logs, indicate that the March date is correct. A painting depicting the launch, dated 25 May 1798, adds further confusion, though it is not clear from the text if the date represents the launching or the date the painting was finished. Foudroyant served Nelson as his flagship from 6 June 1799 until the end of June 1801. Foudroyant had a long and successful career, and although she was not involved in any major fleet action, she did provide invaluable service to numerous admirals throughout her 17 years on active service. In her last years she became a training vessel for boys. Design Her designer was Sir John Henslow. She was named after the 80-gun , which and , both 70-gun ships, and (64 guns), had captured from the French on 28 February 1758. Foudroyant was a one-off design. She followed French practice of favouring large two-decked, third rates mounting 80 guns rather than the typical British preference for building three-decked second-rate ships mounting 98 guns. The two ship types, despite the difference in absolute gun numbers, had similar gun power but the British thought the second rate had a more imposing appearance and some advantages in battle, while they considered the 80 gun ship as usually faster and less 'leewardly'. French Revolutionary War A model of Foudroyant in Monmouth Museum right Foudroyant was first commissioned on 25 May 1798, under the command of Captain Thomas Byard. On 12 October Foudroyant was with the squadron under Captain Sir John Borlase Warren in engaged a French squadron under Commodore Jean-Baptiste-Fran√ßois Bompart in the Battle of Tory Island. The British captured the French ship of the line Hoche and four of the eight French frigates. Foudroyant was only minimally engaged, though she did suffer nine men wounded, and went off in unsuccessful pursuit of the French frigates that had escaped. (Other British warships captured two of these frigates; two frigates and a schooner escaped completely). In 1847 The Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"12th October 1798\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. Byard's command lasted only until 31 October when, after bringing the ship back to Plymouth, he died. Commander William Butterfield took temporary command of the ship until he transferred to just twelve days later. Captain John Elphinstone took up command of the ship on 26 November 1798, in Cawsand Bay. Lord Keith hoisted his flag in Foudroyant on 28 November, and she departed to join the Mediterranean Squadron on 5 December. After arriving at Gibraltar, Keith shifted his flag to on 31 December, and Captain Elphinstone left the ship the following day. His replacement was Captain James Richard Dacres. Dacres' command lasted for four months, before Captain William Brown replaced him on 22 March 1799. On 30 March Foudroyant was among the several British warships in sight, and so entitled to share in the prize money, when captured Saint Joseph or Hermosa Andalusia, off Cadiz. Foudroyant sailed from Gibraltar on 11 May, calling at Port Mahon before arriving at Palermo on 7 June. At this time, Brown transferred to , and Captain Thomas Hardy took over the command. The following day, Lord Nelson hoisted his flag in Foudroyant. Over the following months, Foudroyant was involved in the efforts to return the Neapolitan royal family to Naples. Nelson's fleet arrived in Naples on 24 June.Goodwin, p.182. The fleet consisted of a total of 18 ships of the line, 1 frigate and 2 fire ships.Mutine, a brig-sloop of 16 guns should also be included in this tally. Ships known to have comprised this fleet are: , , , , , , , , , , Vanguard, (ships of the line); (frigate); (brig-sloop). The British landed 500 British and Portuguese marines in support of the Neapolitans on 27 June, all under the command of Captain Sir Thomas Troubridge, of Culloden. The next day they captured the castles Ovo and Nuovo. On 29 June they commenced the siege of Fort St. Elmo. The first batteries were in place by 3 July, with the last still being constructed on 11 July. The British, Portuguese and Russian forces commenced the bombardment on 3 July and the French capitulated on 11 July, forestalling the need for an assault. On 10 July His Sicilian Majesty arrived in the Bay of Naples and immediately hoisted his standard on board the Foudroyant. There the king and his ministers remained until after the capitulation of Fort St. Elmo. A series of reprisals against known insurgents followed. The Neapolitans conducted several courts martial, some of which resulted in hangings. Whilst Foudroyant was in Naples harbour, Nelson began his affair with Emma, Lady Hamilton. Foudroyant departed Naples on 6 August, in company with Syren and the Portuguese ship Principe Real. Foudroyant also transported the Sardinian royal family to Leghorn on 22 September. On 13 October, Foudroyant entered Port Mahon harbour, and Captain Sir Edward Berry replaced Captain Hardy as acting captain. Foudroyant was back in Palermo by 22 October. Nelson remained ashore when Foudroyant departed for Gozo on 29 October, together with . In November, after weathering a storm in Palermo harbour, Foudroyant departed once more, this time with Culloden, and ran aground in the Straits of Messina. With Cullodens assistance, it was possible to haul the ship off and into deep water. On 6 December a large part of the 89th Regiment embarked on Foudroyant. The soldiers landed at St. Paul's Bay, on Malta on the 10th. Foudroyant was back at Palermo on 15 January 1800, when Lord Nelson hoisted his flag in her once again, and she sailed on to Livorno, arriving on the 21st. There Foudroyant received salutes from Danish and Neapolitan frigates, and two Russian ships of the line. On 26 January Foudroyant was in company with Minorca and when she recaptured the Ragusan polacca Annonciata, Michele Pepi, master. She was carrying grain from Tunis to Genoa. Sicilian soldiers embarked on 11 February, and Foudroyant sailed the next day for Malta, in company with Alexander, Northumberland (both 74s), and (32). (74), and (16) joined them later. On 18 February, the British squadron began a chase of a squadron of four French ships ‚Äî G√©n√©reux (74), Badine (24), Fauvette (20), another corvette of 20 guns, and a fluyt. Alexander forced the fluyt to surrender, whilst Success engaged G√©n√©reux, and the two ships exchanged a couple of broadsides before Foudroyant came up and fired into G√©n√©reux, which struck her colours.The victory was of particular significance to Berry. In 1798, after the Battle of the Nile, he was returning to England in command of when he encountered G√©n√©reux. After a lopsided and courageous battle with G√©n√©reux Berry had had to surrender. Subsequently, his captors maltreated Berry and his crew. It turned out that Rear-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Perr√©e, the commander-in-chief of the French navy in the Mediterranean, had been aboard G√©n√©reux and had been killed at the start of the action. His ships had been carrying some 4,000 troops intended to relieve Malta. Their failure to arrive significantly harmed the French hold on Malta and was a testament to the success of the British blockade of the island. British casualties amounted to one man killed and eight wounded, all on Success. At the beginning of March, Nelson remained at Palermo due to illness when on 25 March Foudroyant sailed for Malta once more with Rear-Admiral Decres on board. On 29 March, she encountered the sloop , and from her Berry learned that French ships were expected to leave Valletta that evening. Guillaume Tell put to sea on the evening of the 30th, where she encountered and . As day broke and the scene became apparent, Foudroyant maneuvered to pistol range of the French ship ‚Äî the last French survivor of Aboukir, G√©n√©reux being the only other ‚Äî and joined the battle. Foudroyant's log for the Action of 31 March 1800 notes that at one point during the battle the French had nailed their colours to the stump of Guillaume Tells mizzen mast. Still, Guillaume Tell eventually struck, but not before Foudroyant had lost her fore topmast and main topsail yard. The initial estimates put the number of dead and wounded on Lion and Foudroyant at 40 per vessel. Later in the day, Foudroyant's mizzen mast fell, having been damaged during the battle. Lion took Foudroyant in tow for a time, whilst a jury rig was set up. She entered Syracuse on 3 April. Amongst the British vessels, Foudroyant had borne the heaviest casualties with eight men killed and 61 wounded, including Berry, who was only slightly wounded and did not leave the deck during the fight. The British estimated that the French had had over two hundred casualties. On 3 June, the Neapolitan king and queen boarded Foudroyant, accompanied by Sir William Hamilton and his wife Emma. The royal family departed the ship after their arrival in Livorno on 15 June, and just two weeks later Nelson hauled down his flag and began the journey home to England overland together with the Hamiltons. Lord Keith raised his flag in Foudroyant for the second time on 15 August, returning the ship to Gibraltar on 13 September. Captain Berry transferred out of the ship on 2 November for the 38-gun frigate . Captain Philip Beaver took over the command on 17 November and sailed into the Eastern Mediterranean with a fleet of 51 vessels, many armed en fl√ªte and carrying the 16,150 men of General Sir Ralph Abercromby's force, which was intended to drive the French out of Egypt. Still, on 22 December Foudroyant captured the French brig Hyppolite, which was carrying rice from Alexandria to Marseilles. Keith sailed from Marmarice on 22 February, arriving off Abukir Bay on 2 March. Sea conditions meant that the British were unable to land until 8 March. They met resistance from the French but by evening all the troops had landed and driven the French from the beach. The landing cost Foudroyant one man killed and one wounded. In all, the landings cost the British 22 men killed, 72 men wounded, and three missing. On the 13th, the landing party of seamen and marines, under the command of Captain Sir William Sidney Smith, were again in action at Mandora as the British moved towards Alexandria. Foudroyant had one man wounded. In all, the British navy lost six seamen killed and 19 wounded, and 24 marines killed and 35 wounded. Keith then used his ships to reduce the castle at the entrance of Abukir Bay, which eventually fell to the British on 18 March 1801. A French counter-attack on 21 March by some 20,000 men, although ending in defeat, caused General Abercromby a severe injury; he died aboard Foudroyant a week after the battle. In addition to the army losses, the Royal Navy lost four men killed and 20 wounded, though none were from Foudroyant. Foudroyant lay off Alexandria until June, and on 17 June Captain Beaver transferred to . His replacement was Captain William Young, who in turn was replaced by Captain T. Stephenson. Captain John Clarke Searle took command in June 1801, before handing over to Captain John Elphinstone, again, in September. In mid-August, the fleet transported the British army to Alexandria. On 26 September the French proposed a three-day armistice to discuss terms of capitulation. Because Foudroyant had served in the navy's Egyptian campaign between 8 March 1801 and 2 September, her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 for all surviving claimants. When the Treaty of Amiens was signed, bringing the war to an end in 1802, Foudroyant was paid off at Plymouth Dock (Devonport) on 26 July. Napoleonic Wars In January 1803, Foudroyant was docked in Plymouth Dock for a somewhat major repair. The ship was recommissioned under the command of Captain Peter Spicer on 11 June. Her former captain, now Rear Admiral Sir James Richard Dacres, hoisted his flag on the same day, and remained aboard until 28 October. Two days later, Rear Admiral of the White, Sir Thomas Graves hoisted his flag. Captain Peter Puget took over the command on 27 February 1804; however, owing to a serious injury while Foudroyant served with the Channel Fleet, he was returned to England (leaving Christopher Nesham in acting command) and officially left the ship on 31 May 1805. Foudroyant returned to dock on 26 March 1804 for repairs. 24 February 1805 saw Captain Edward Kendall take over the command, and in June Foudroyant was flagship of Grave's fleet, consisting of Barfleur, Raisonnable, Repulse, Triumph, Warrior, Windsor Castle, and Egyptienne blockading the French port of Rochefort. Command of the ship passed to Captain John Erskine Douglas on 9 December temporarily, before Captain John Chambers White assumed command on the 13th. On 13 March 1806, Foudroyant was involved in an action between some ships of the fleet and two French vessels - Marengo of 80 guns, and Belle Poule of 40. Both ships were captured and taken into the navy. On 24 November Captain Richard Peacock took command of the ship, and Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren hoisted his flag in Foudroyant on 19 December. Rear Admiral Sir Albemarle Bertie raised his flag in Foudroyant on 20 May 1807, and remained in the ship until 17 November. Peacock's command passed to Captain Norborne Thompson on 31 May. Foudroyant joined with Admiral Sir Sir Sidney Smith's squadron blockading Lisbon. Smith hoisted his flag in Foudroyant on 24 January 1808. Captain Charles Marsh Schomberg took command of the ship on 6 June. On 12 March Foudroyant parted company for South America, arriving in R√≠o de Janeiro in August. Captain John Davie took command on 25 January 1809, and then Captain Richard Hancock on 17 May. Smith transferred his flag to on the same day. From 25 May, Foudroyant was in company with , , , and Brilliant, escorting a convoy. On 8 June they entered Moldonado Bay at the mouth of the R√≠o de la Plata where Agamemnon struck rocks and was wrecked. Foudroyant assisted in taking off men and stores from the stricken ship and no lives were lost. Foudroyant remained in the R√≠o area until August 1812, when she returned to England, entering Cawsand Bay on 21 October, and entering Plymouth Dock on 6 November. Hancock departed the ship on 30 November, and then Foudroyant lay at her anchor until 26 January 1815, when she was taken into dock for a large repair that lasted 4 years. Post-war Foudroyant seen next to the Argentine torpedo boat destroyer Santa Fe - circa 1897 When Foudroyant came out of dock in 1819, she took up her role as guard ship in Plymouth Dock (renamed Devonport 1824) until about 1860. Throughout this period she was in and out of dock on several occasions for repairs. In 1862 she was converted into a gunnery training vessel, a role she fulfilled until 1884. She was thereafter stationed at Devonport on dockyard duties, and was attached as to tender to the gunnery schoolship HMS Cambridge. She was finally placed on the Sales List in 1891 and sold out of the service the following January for ¬£2,350. Bought by J. Read of Portsmouth, she was promptly resold to German shipbreakers. This prompted a storm of public protest. Wheatly Cobb of Caldicot Castle then bought her and restored her to her original appearance at a cost of ¬£25,000, using the ship as a training vessel. To offset the restoration cost, it was then decided to exhibit her at various seaside resorts. Fate Cabinet at Monmouth Museum made of the wreckage of the Foudroyant and containing objects also made from the ship. The wreck of HMS Foudroyant In June 1897 she was towed to Blackpool and could be visited for a small entrance fee. On 16 June 1897 during a violent storm, she parted a cable and dragging the remaining anchor, went ashore on Blackpool Sands, damaging Blackpool North Pier in the process. The Blackpool lifeboat was able to rescue all 27 of her crew. After vain attempts to refloat her, her guns were removed and she was sold for ¬£200. She finally broke up in the December gales. Craftsmen used flotsam from the wreck to make furniture,One such piece was featured on the BBC Antiques Roadshow, 2005, in the Portsmouth, UK episode focusing on Lord Nelson. AC200607 Lot:120-149 and, between 1929 and 2003, the wall panelling of the boardroom of Blackpool F.C.'s Bloomfield Road ground. The ship's bell now resides in Blackpool Town Hall. Copper, salvaged from the wreck, was used to manufacture Medals, which were sold to the general public. As a replacement, Cobb purchased the 38-gun frigate , and renamed her Foudroyant in the previous ship's honour. This Foudroyant remained in service until 1991, when she was taken to Hartlepool and renamed back to Trincomalee.

It is known as smallest inhabited riverine island in the world. Country boats that are available on the bank of Brahmaputra take the visitors to the island. The mountain on which the temple has been built is known as Bhasmacala. Legend Siva is said to have resided here in the form of Bhayananda. According to the Kalika Purana, in the beginning of the creation Siva sprinkled ashes (bhasma) at this place and imparted knowledge to Parvati (his consort). It is said that, when Siva was in meditation on this hillock, Kamadeva interrupted his yoga and was therefore burnt to ashes by the fire of Siva‚Äôs anger and hence the hillock got the name Bhasmacala. This mountain is also called Bhasmakuta. The Kalika Purana states that Urvasikunda is situated here and here resides the goddess Urvasi who brings Amrit (nectar) for the enjoyment of Kamakhya and hence the island got the name Urvasi Island. Presiding Deity The presiding deity of the temple is Umananda (Tatrasti bhagavan sambhu- ruma- nandakarah Prabhu). The name 'Umananda' comes from the two Hindi words, namely 'Uma', which was another name for Lord Shiva‚Äôs wife and 'Ananda' which means happiness. In fact, Peacock Island is one of the smallest inhabited island and possibly one of the most beautiful too. The surroundings of the temple and the divine but understated beauty of the island make it a haven for nature lovers. It is believed that, worship here on the Amavasya day when it falls on Monday brings the highest bliss. The Siva Chaturdasi is the most colourful festival that is held here annually. Many devotees come to the temple on this occasion for the worship of the deity. History Evidence of a stone temple belonging to the post-Gupta period can be seen on the site. The site has stone sculptures and carvings belonging to the early mediaeval period. Achaturbhuja stone female figure still exists here besidesrock cut figures of Ganesa and a cave. Brick temple of Umananda was built in 1694 A.D. by the Bar Phukan Garhganya Handique by the order of King Gadadhar Singha (1681‚Äì1696), one of the ablest and strongest rulers of the Ahom dynasty. The original temple was however immensely damaged by a devastating earthquake of 1897. Later, it was reconstructed by a rich local merchant who chose to inscribe the interior part of a Siva temple with Vaisnavite slogans. During the short period of the Mughal occupation of Kamrupa. Land men and money were received by the priests of the temples of Umananda from the Mughal Emperors Jahangir and Aurangzeb.http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/43033/15/15_chapter%20v%20%20temple%20management%20system%20and%20administration%20in%20the%20land%20of%20kamakhya.pdf Structure The temple has inherited some rock-cut figures, which speak passionately of the masterly skill of the Assamese craftsmen. The sculptures here show that the worshippers there followed all the principal Hindu gods. Representations of Surya, Ganesha, Shiva and Devi (with a scorpion as emblem) in addition to those of Visnu and his ten incarnations (avatar) are found here. The main shrine is reached by a flight of steep steps. The Umananda temple was crafted beautifully by the skilled Assamese workmen. Aside from Lord Shiva, there are 10 other Hindu Gods whose idols reside in the shrines. Aside from being a place of worship, The Umananda temple is also a pleasurable exception to the typical places of worship. Devoid of the cacophony of forceful religion, this place has a serene environment which makes you want to sit down for a while and absorb the beauty of the place.  Access  The Peacock Island can be accessed from Guwahati and North Guwahati by ferries and steamers. One can hire a ferry from Sukleshwar ghat or Fancy Bazar Ghat. This is expensive but one can get the feel of the river and its surroundings without any interventions. This is most ideal for couples and family trips. However, a much convenient and cheaper transport has been provided by Inland Water Transport, which connects the Peacock island to Guwahati from Uzanbazar Ferry Ghat also known as ka hari ghat. The fees is as low as 20 rupees per person.150+ stairs have to be climbed to reach the temple.

The screenplay was written by Robert Anderson, based upon the popular 1956 novel of the same name by Kathryn Hulme. The film tells the life of Sister Luke (Hepburn), a young Belgian woman who decides to enter a convent and make the many sacrifices required by her choice. The film is a relatively faithful adaptation of the novel, which was based on the life of Belgian nun Marie Louise Habets. Latter portions of the film were shot on location in the Belgian Congo and feature Finch as a cynical but caring surgeon. Plot Gabrielle \\"Gaby\\" Van Der Mal (Audrey Hepburn), whose father Hubert (Dean Jagger) is a prominent surgeon in Belgium, enters a convent of nursing sisters in the late 1920s, hoping to serve in the Belgian Congo. After receiving the religious name of Sister Luke, she undergoes her postulancy and novitiate which foreshadow her future difficulties with the vow of obedience. She takes her first vows and is sent to a school of tropical medicine. After passing her courses with high marks, along with some spiritual conflict, she silently resists the Mother Superior's request to purposely fail her final exam as a proof of her humility. Despite finishing fourth in her class, she is not assigned to the Congo but sent to a European mental hospital where she assists with the most difficult and violent cases, wasting her tropical medicine skills. A particularly violent schizophrenic (Colleen Dewhurst) tricks Sister Luke into opening the cell door in violation of the rules. She attacks Sister Luke, who barely escapes and once again faces the shame of her disobedience. Eventually she takes her solemn vows and is sent to her long-desired posting in the Congo. Once there, she is disappointed that she will not be nursing the natives, but will instead work in a segregated whites/European patient hospital. She develops a strained but professional relationship with the brilliant, atheistic surgeon there, Dr. Fortunati (Peter Finch). Eventually, the work strains and spiritual struggles cause her to succumb to tuberculosis. Fortunati, not wanting to lose a competent nurse and sympathetic to her desire to stay in the Congo, engineers a treatment plan that allows her to remain there rather than having to convalesce in Europe. After Sister Luke recovers and returns to work, Fortunati is forced to send her to Belgium as the only nurse qualified to accompany a VIP who has become mentally unstable. She spends an outwardly reflective but inwardly restless period at the motherhouse in Brussels before the superior general gives her a new assignment. Due to the impending war in Europe, she cannot return to the Congo, and is assigned as a surgical nurse at a local hospital. While at her new assignment, Sister Luke's struggle with obedience becomes impossible for her to sustain, as she is repeatedly forced into compromises to cope with the reality of the Nazi occupation, including that they have killed her father. No longer able to continue as a nun, she requests and is granted a dispensation from her vows. She is last seen changing into lay garb and exiting the convent through a back door.

Zinnemann was immediately interested in an adaptation, but there was little traction from studios until Audrey Hepburn expressed her interest. The cast and crew included few if any Catholics. Fred Zinnemann was Jewish. Audrey Hepburn and Edith Evans were Christian Scientists. The film's writer, Robert Anderson, was a Protestant, and Peggy Ashcroft was Agnostic. To ensure accuracy and fidelity, a number of consultants were used. The screenplay was reviewed by the literary editor of America, by a panel of Dominican Priests in Rome, and by the Los Angeles chapter of the National Legion of Decency. The production team also corresponded regularly with Kathryn Hulme, the author of the source material. The Kathryn Hulme collection at Yale University contains 37 of these letters. Further, the director and many of the actresses in the film spent time in European convents prior to rehearsal and principal photography. Zinnemann describes the Catholic Church as somewhat hesitant at first, in part worried that the film would depict a romantic relationship between Sister Luke and Dr. Fortunati. Once the Church had more confidence in the production, there was a high level of collaboration leading to a high level of preparation that Zinnemann credits for the realism and emotional intensity of the film. Zinnemann also continued his usual practices of collaborating with the film's writer on the second draft of the screenplay (though not receiving a writing credit) and meeting with each major actor for an in-depth discussion of his or her character. To prepare for her role Audrey Hepburn met with both Hulme and Mary Louise Habets, the inspiration for the novel and film. The three spent a considerable amount of time together, apparently becoming known as \\"The 3-H Club.\\" Hepburn and Habets had some surprising similarities. Both had Belgian roots and had experienced personal trauma during World War II including losing touch with their fathers and having their brothers imprisoned by Germans. Habets later helped nurse Hepburn back to health following her near-fatal horse-riding accident on the set of the 1960 film The Unforgiven. The cast was rounded out by Colleen Dewhurst, making her first screen appearance and Ren√©e Zinnemann, the wife of the director who played the assistant of the Mother Superior (Edith Evans). = Principal photography = This house on the in Bruges was a backdrop of the movie The film was shot partially in the then Belgian Congo, now Democratic Republic of the Congo with production based in then Stanleyville, now Kisangani and some scenes shot in Yakusu, a nearby center of missionary and medical activity where cast and crew met the famous missionary Stanley George Browne. Fred Zinnemann had originally intended to film only the African scenes in color, with Europe rendered in stark black and white. There was originally a scene towards the end of the film depicting three men endangered by quicksand and rapidly rising water, but it was never filmed due to adverse conditions. Interior scenes for the Belgian portions of the film were shot in Rome at Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia and Cinecitt√† on sets designed by Alexandre Trauner. Extras for these scenes were recruited from the ballet corps of the Rome Opera company. Zinnemann wanted actors who would be capable of precise and coordinated movement. Belgian exteriors were shot on location in Bruges although the novel took place in Ghent. =Post-production= According to Zinnemann, composer Franz Waxman's dislike of the Catholic Church was a conspicuous influence on early drafts of the score. This is part of the reason why the final scene has no score, an uncommon stylistic choice for the era. Regardless of Waxman's work, Zinnemann had always wanted the film to end in silence. The original theatrical trailer for the film contains a brief shot of Gabrielle and her father sitting at a cafe. The shot is an excerpt from a scene that was removed from the final cut. The scene is alluded to in the final film when Dr. Van Der Mal mentions a restaurant reservation at the beginning of the film. Zinnemann removed the scene because he felt it was redundant and hindered the pace of the film's opening. Awards and honors The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Actress in a Leading Role (Audrey Hepburn); Best Cinematography, Color; Best Director; Best Film Editing; Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture; Best Picture; Best Sound (George Groves); and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. The film was recognized by American Film Institute in 2005 as a nominee for AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores and in 2006 as a nominee for AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers. Reception The Nun's Story carries a 93% favorable rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 15 reviews. The Nun's Story was a major box office success in its day. Produced on a budget of $3.5 million, it grossed $12.8 million at the domestic box office, earning $6.3 million in US theatrical rentals.\\"1959: Probable Domestic Take\\", Variety, January 6, 1960 p 34. The Nun's Story was considered, for a time, to be the most financially successful of Hepburn's films and the one the actress often cited as her favorite. The Nun's Story received its first official North American DVD release on April 4, 2006. The story behind the book and film was the subject of The Belgian Nurse, a radio play by Zoe Fairbairns, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on January 13, 2007. According to correspondences in the Kathryn Hulme collection at Yale University, both Mary Louise Habets and Kathryn Hulme were pleased with the film and its success.

The siege was part of French King Louis XIV‚Äôs campaign against Victor Amadeus, the Duke of Savoy, who had sided with the Grand Alliance the previous year. The siege was an attempt to gain a foothold on the Piedmont Plain, thus ensuring Marshal Catinat's army could winter east of the Alps. Yet due to the incompetence of the two French commanders (in fact, General Vivien de Bulonde, because of decoded messages from Louis XIV to Catinat authorizing his punishment, has been proposed by some to have been the Man in the Iron Mask) ‚Äì and a timely arrival of Imperial reinforcements ‚Äì the siege proved a disaster, resulting in the loss of between 700 and 800 men. Although French forces had taken Nice in the west, and Montm√©lian in the north, Catinat's small, ill-equipped army was forced onto the defensive. Louis XIV subsequently offered Amadeus generous peace terms but the Duke, who had by now received substantial Imperial reinforcements from the Empire, considered himself strong enough to continue hostilities. Background In an attempt to free himself from French vassalage Duke Victor Amadeus of Savoy had declared for the Grand Alliance in June 1690, but in the first campaign he had suffered a major defeat by Marshal Catinat at the Battle of Staffarda on 18 August. Utilising France's main base at Pinerolo Catinat subsequently captured several other towns in the region. However, due to communication problems and poor logistics (leading to shortages in supply and men), the French were obliged to withdraw from the Piedmont plain at the end of 1690, and move into winter quarters west of the Alps.Wolf: Louis XIV, 562 The French began the 1691 campaign early. In March Catinat crossed the border into the County of Nice to attack the southern coastal towns of Nice and Villefranche (it was imperative to take both positions because of their potential to act as a springboard for Allied land and amphibious attacks against Provence; conversely, their capture would facilitate French operations in southern Piedmont).Rowlands: Louis XIV, Vittorio Amedeo II and French Military Failure in Italy, 1689-96. Villefranche immediately capitulated to Catinat on 20 March; the town of Nice also quickly surrendered, but its citadel held out against a detachment under General Vins until 1 April. Nice was captured for the loss of just 100 men, and the whole county was now almost entirely under the control of Louis XIV. Of all the Savoyard towns west of the Alps only Montm√©lian, in the Duchy of Savoy, remained in the Duke's hands. Siege At the beginning of the Nine Years War, the territories of Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy, primarily split into several distinct regions, notably: County of Nice, the Duchy of Savoy and the Principality of Piedmont, which contained the capital city of Turin. In Piedmont the Marquis de Feuqui√®res marched south-west out of Pinerolo on 18 April to attack the Vaudois and refugee French Huguenots in Luserna. Encountering little resistance Feuqui√®res, who had suffered defeat at Luserna the previous year, sacked the town, killing many of its inhabitants. Catinat, meanwhile, ravaged the Turin‚ÄìSusa route. Although the capture of Turin, Piedmont's capital, was not possible due to lack of infantry and supply, Catinat took Avigliana on 29 May, before sending a large corps under Feuqui√®res and Bulonde to besiege Cuneo on the Stura in southern Piedmont. Cuneo's capture would enable the French to spend the 1691‚Äì92 winter east of the Alps, but the incompetence of the two commanders turned the expedition into an unmitigated disaster. On hearing the approach of a relief force of Imperial cavalry under Prince Eugene of Savoy and Spanish troops led by the Marquis of Legan√©s,Maffi, La cittadella in armi, 39 Bulonde lost his nerve and raised the siege.Wolf: Louis XIV, 564 With the loss of between 700‚Äì800 troops the French army abandoned its supplies, its wounded, and its heavy guns, degenerating into a fleeing rabble as it tried to regain Catinat's main force near Turin. Cuneo's garrison had held out, and was still intact when Eugene arrived. Having reinforced the town Eugene returned to Turin. Aftermath In July Feuqui√®res managed to get reinforcements and cash to the main French stronghold of Casale, cut off on the far eastern border of Amadeus's territory (the only time this was achieved in the war). Nevertheless, French forces in the Italian theatre continued to be handicapped by supply and manning shortages. Earlier, on 9 June, Catinat had taken Carmagnola, but in August 13,000 Imperial troops ‚Äì who had recently fought against the Ottomans in the War of the Holy League ‚Äì arrived to reinforce Amadeus, raising his strength (on paper) to 45,000.Lynn: The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667‚Äì1714, 220. The reinforcements under Count Antonio Caraffa were paid for by the Maritime Powers, England and the Dutch republic. On 26 September the Allies crossed the river Po to retake the lost town. Due to the lack of available French troops, Carmagnola capitulated to the Allies on 8 October. Meanwhile, the Marquis de La Hoguette, commanding French forces in the Duchy of Savoy, raided the Aosta Valley in preparation for the siege of Montm√©lian. The valley was one of the two main routes into Savoy through which Amadeus could send assistance from Piedmont (the capture of Susa in November 1690 had blocked the only other direct route). Hoguette reached as far south as Bard before returning to Savoy, destroying behind him all the bridges and passing points. Due to a lack of siege guns Montm√©lian could not be properly invested until November.Rowlands: Louis XIV, Vittorio Amedeo II and French Military Failure in Italy, 1689-96. The concentration of most of the French artillery infrastructure and materiel on the Flanders frontier and in Alsace, severely handicapped the French army of Italy throughout the war. However, when it became apparent that no relief was coming from Piedmont, the town's governor finally yielded the citadel on 22 December. Although the French had achieved little in Piedmont, Catinat now controlled almost all of the County of Nice and the Duchy of Savoy. At peace talks in mid-summer Louis XIV had insisted keeping his gains in Nice, several Piedmontese towns on the route to Casale, and Montm√©lian; some 2,400 of Amadeus's troops, together with three dragoon regiments were also expected to join with French forces against the Grand Alliance on other fronts. However, on 16 July, the King's highly influential and belligerent War Minister, Louvois, died; 12 days later Louis XIV recalled the more moderate Pomponne to sit in the Conseil d'en haut, the consequences of which were to alter the political direction of the state.Wolf: Louis XIV, 568 Now facing a superior enemy, and unable to sustain their forces on the Piedmontese plain, Louis XIV offered further peace terms in December, but these provisions bore no resemblance to the original demands at the beginning of the war in Italy in May 1690. Louis XIV was now prepared to indemnify Savoy for the costs of the war, and the places France had conquered would be sequestrated in neutral hands; Casale would be razed, and, in the event of the death of Charles II, King of Spain, Louis XIV would help Amadeus to conquer the Milanese. By now, however, Amadeus was not prepared to negotiate seriously, especially as he anticipated military superiority for the following campaign. The peace terms were rejected and hostilities resumed the following year. References Sources *Lynn, John A (1999). The Wars of Louis XIV: 1667‚Äì1714. Longman. *MacMunn, George (1933).

He is known for his work in various Hong Kong martial arts films such as Bruce Lee's Way of the Dragon, Jackie Chan's The Young Master and Angela Mao's Hapkido. He was awarded a 10th degree black belt, the highest rank possible in the art, by the World Hapkido Association. Early years Born in Sunch'≈èn, north of Pyongyang in present-day North Korea, Hwang In-shik and his family moved to Seoul while he was a young child and it was there that he was introduced to the martial arts, first to Tang Soo Do and then to hapkido at age 13.Lee, Daniel.

According to Kim Hyung- sang of the Ulchigwan dojang, Hwang's first teacher was Kim Yong-jin. Hwang earned his black belt at age 16 and was sent shortly thereafter to the Korea Hapkido Association headed by Ji Han-Jae. During a crucial time in the style's development, many of the prime movers in hapkido today were his seniors there including Han Bong-soo, Kim Chong-sung and Myung Kwang-sik.Kimm, He-Young. Hapkido (alternately The Hapkido Bible). Andrew Jackson Press, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 1991 Hwang was especially known at this time for his superlative kicking ability. He was eventually promoted to 7th-dan black belt in 1976 by the Korea Hapkido Association (ÎåÄÌïúÎØºÍµ≠ Ìï©Í∏∞ÎèÑÌòëÌöå) and was appointed chief instructor of the association's headquarters. He soon became known as an influential and well known teacher of the art. Hong Kong cinema Hong Kong filmmaker Huang Feng brought Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan, Tang Wei-cheng, Hu Yin-yin, Angela Mao, Chang Yi and Chin Hsiang-lin to Seoul for a location shoot in 1972. Huang was also looking for impressive new techniques to infuse into the Hong Kong action sequences, and so had his stars train at the Korea Hapkido Association for about four months under Hwang and association chief Ji Han-jae. Many of the impressive kicking techniques seen in Hong Kong cinema today are a result of the cross-cultural influence of this time. Hung had a particular affinity for the training, and some of his signature techniques such as the jumping double front kick come directly from the hapkido syllabus. Impressed by the hapkido practitioners, Huang invited both Hwang and Ji to Hong Kong to develop a film idea inspired by the director's experiences in Korea. Made in 1972, the movie was titled Hapkido and is known abroad under the English title Lady Kung-fu. It starred Angela Mao, Sammo Hung and Carter Wong (Huang Chia-da). In the film, Ji and Hwang basically play themselves, a hapkido master and his top student who teach the style to a group Chinese students. Subsequent films such as Fist of Unicorn (1973) also featured both Hwang and Ji playing different roles. Hwang went on to star in other films, the first stage of his career ending after the death of Bruce Lee, whom Hwang had been in talks with on a part in Game of Death the week Lee died. Hwang also appeared briefly in Lee's Way of the Dragon in 1972 as a Japanese karateka. After returning to Korea, Hwang over the next few years starred in a series of Korean martial arts movies including A Wandering Hero, Black Leopard and Black Spider.Entry in Korean Movie Database. retrieved May 10, 2007 Hwang then immigrated to Canada and opened up a dojang in the city of Toronto, retiring from cinema. Later, Jackie Chan, a stuntman from Hwang's early films, rose to prominence in Hong Kong cinema and coaxed Hwang out of retirement to film The Young Master (1980), featuring in its original form a 15-minute fight scene between Chan and Hwang, and Dragon Lord (1982), in which Hwang plays a villain opposing Chan.Meyers, Ric and Palmer, Bill.

Nearly all of Kong's music is instrumental, with the only vocals being an eclectic blend of sampling. The band takes a quadrophonic approach to their shows: live performances are played in a quadraphonic setup, with each band member having his/her own independent stage and PA system. History =1988-2000= Kong was formed in 1988 by guitarist/synth programmer Dirk de Vries, guitarist Aldo Sprenger, bassist/synth programmer Mark Drillich, and drummer Rob Smits. The band released their debut album Mute Poet Vocalizer in 1990 and started touring across Europe. Kong's second album Phlegm was released in 1992 and contains the band's best-known song Stockhouse. The band released the follow-up to Phlegm, Push Comes To Shove, in 1995. Shortly after the release, founding members Sprenger and Smits left the band and were replaced by guitarist Marieke Verdonk and drummer Rob Snijders. With this lineup, Kong recorded the album Earmined; their first album to be released by Roadrunner Records. Snijders left in 1998, and drumming duties for 1999's Freakcontrol album were split between new drummer Klaas Broekema and former member Rob Smits. After touring in support of Freakcontrol, the band decided to take an \\"open-ended sabbatical\\" and virtually disbanded. =2007-present= After a seven-year hiatus, Kong was revived by Drillich, and completed by guitarist Tijs Keverkamp, guitarist/synth operator David Kox, and drummer Mandy Hopman. In 2009 the album What It Seems Is What You Get was released by the band's own label Kongenial. Both the album and the subsequent performances were well received by fans and critics, prompting the band to start working on more music. This resulted in the album Merchants Of Air, released in 2012. Hopman left Kong in 2013 and was succeeded by Oscar Alblas. On September 19, 2014, Kong released the third album since their revival, entitled Stern. Quadraphonic live setup The idea for Kong's quadraphonical live setup originated at one of the band‚Äôs very first gigs. On the opening night of an art exhibition in a squatted Amsterdam bathhouse there was too little space for the band to play together, so each band member stood in a different corner of the room, with his own stage and PA system. It proved an interesting setup for the band and created a strange experience for the audience. They followed the same approach for their next gig at Melkweg in Amsterdam and, since then, have hardly ever performed with all four members on the same stage again. Trivia * Kong's website remains one of the few internet resources available for information on the band. Additionally, much of the band's discography can now only be purchased directly from them. * Kong are not to be confused with the Manchester-based noise rock band of the same name.

History According to legend, the creature first appeared near Pendennis Point in 1975, described as having a trunk with a very long neck and black or brown skin \\"like a sea lion's\\". Local mackerel fisherman blamed bad weather and poor fishing on supposed sightings of the monster. Some versions of the story say the monster appeared after German submarine U28 torpedoed a British merchant ship during World War I, and describe it as 60 feet long, shaped like a crocodile with four webbed feet and a powerful tail. Folklorists speculate that Cornish author Tony 'Doc' Shiels \\"invented\\" the creature as a hoax, having coined the name \\"Morgawr\\" after claiming to sight it in 1976. According to the story, Shiels sent the Falmouth Packet newspaper photographs of the monster attributed to an anonymous individual called \\"Mary F\\". The same year in July, fishermen John Cock and George Vinnicombe claimed to have sighted the creature in the waters off Lizard Point. Also in 1976, Shiels claimed to have photographed the creature lying low in the water near Mawnan. According to some anecdotes, British writer Sheila Bird claimed to have seen the monster while walking the cliffs of Gerrans Bay in 1985.

It is a book of 783 psalms, hymns and spiritual songs for use in Christian worship in Australia and elsewhere. It is a significant revision of The Australian Hymn Book published 22 years earlier. It was created by an ecumenical editorial committee chaired by Canon Dr. Lawrence Bartlett and containing representatives from the Anglican, Churches of Christ, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic and Uniting churches. Major changes include modernising the texts (using inclusive language and reducing archaic language), removing hymns that had fallen out of use, emphasising psalms, and adding of more modern musical settings and worship songs. The book also reflects changes agreed by the English Language Liturgical Consultation in 1988. Canon Dr. Lawrence Bartlett describes the book as \\"Ecumenical in that it represents the liturgical insights of those churches represented on the Editorial Committee\\" and \\"Contemporary in that all the material, whether old or new, is presented so that today's worshippers can use it without embarrassment or confusion.\\" The collection of hymns is intentionally international with material drawn from 48 countries. The addition of new songs has broadened the range of musical styles represented, spanning from plainsong to worship songs composed at Hillsong. The most represented hymnwriter is Charles Wesley with 41 hymns, while contemporary hymnwriters like Brian Wren has 24 hymns included, John L. Bell has 27 and Shirley E. Murray has 5. In some circumstances, where the editorial committee could not find a song that adequately fulfilled a need they wrote their own such as Shirley Ludgater's hymn about marriage as an act of creation: \\"When the light of first creation\\". One criticism of the book is that the use of inclusive language (noted by alt. after the author's name) has ruined the flow of many older hymns. The hymns are divided into sections reflecting theological themes or liturgical uses and are arranged chronologically within each section. The hymn book is available in harmony, melody line (with guitar chords), large print, software and audio CD editions. The harmony version contains multiple indexes of tunes, metres, composers and arrangers, authors and translators, texts based on scripture passages, subjects, the church year, first lines and common titles (but not the guitar chords which appear in the melody edition). The melody edition omits some of these indexes. In 2017 it was announced that there would be no further printings of the hymnal as the publisher, HarperCollins, decided not to renew licence agreements with copyright holders upon their expiration in 2018.

Postwar, her periods of active service alternated with time in reserve, until she was sold for scrap in 1963.  Design and construction  Liberty ships were a type of cargo ship with a uniform design intended to be quickly built for wartime needs during World War II. In general, Liberty ships were named after famous Americans, and Timothy Bloodworth was named for Timothy Bloodworth, a teacher and statesman from North Carolina. The ship was the 44th of 188 Liberty ships built by Delta Shipbuilding Company of New Orleans. Timothy Bloodworth (USMC hull number 1033) was laid down on 2 February 1943 on way number 8. She was launched on 17 March after spending 41 days on the ways. Timothy Bloodworth was completed on 22 April, after 36 days fitting out on the water. Her total construction time from keel laying to delivery was 77 days. Timothy Bloodworth was and was long (length overall) and abeam. She was electrically welded, and had a deadweight tonnage of . Like all Liberty ships, she had a single triple-expansion steam engine that drove a single screw propeller.

After nearly a month at Methil, Timothy Bloodworth departed there on 4 August as a part of convoy EN 264 for Loch Ewe, and from the latter port, sailed as a part of the 78-ship convoy ON 196. Timothy Bloodworth is reported in convoy documents as destined for Halifax along with seven other ships, but other records indicate that the ship arrived at New York with the majority of the convoy on 21 August. Whatever her arrival port, she was recorded as sailing from Halifax on 22 August in convoy HF 72 and arriving at Saint John, New Brunswick two days later. She is next reported as sailing for Halifax on 16 September and then on to Liverpool as a part of convoy HX 257 on 18 September. With her cargo of grain and other cargo, Timothy Bloodworth arrived in Liverpool on 30 September, where she would remain for almost a month. On 27 October, Timothy Bloodworth departed from Liverpool as a part of the combined convoys OS 57 and KMS 31. On 9 November, west of Gibraltar, KMS 31, Timothy Bloodworths convoy, parted company with the other ships and headed into the Mediterranean. Timothy Bloodworth, however, headed into Gibraltar and docked there on 10 November.The convoy that Timothy Bloodworth departed, KMS 31, came under attack by German bombers which sank three convoy ships on 11 November. See: The ship departed Gibraltar with convoy KMS 32 on 19 November and arrived at her destination of Malta on 24 November. Timothy Bloodworth had made her way to Augusta by early December when she was recorded making a roundtrip to Brindisi between 6 and 21 December. By early January 1944, she had made her way to Bizerta, and from there on 8 January for Naples, where she arrived three days later. The cargo ship sailed from that port on 29 January, touching at Augusta the next day, and then joining convoy GUS 29 for Hampton Roads, Virginia. Sources show Timothy Bloodworth arriving at Hampton Roads on 15 February but do not report any movements until early May, when she is shown sailing for Liverpool. Timothy Bloodworth, loaded with a cargo that included Motor Launches, departed New York on 6 May as a part of convoy HX 290 for Liverpool. After an uneventful crossing, she made port at Liverpool on 19 May. After unloading her cargo over the next two weeks, she departed for New York in convoy ON 239 and arrived there on 22 June. Timothy Bloodworth departed again for Liverpool on 11 July as a part of HX 299 and arrived after thirteen days. The ship is next reported sailing from Southend to the Solent on 4 August, and from Portland to Seine Bay on 6 August. Timothy Bloodworth sailed from Seine Bay to Southampton from 5 to 6 September. The next day, she is recorded sailing from the Solent to the Bristol Channel, a week before sailing again for New York. After arriving at New York at the end of September, Timothy Bloodworth made her way to Boston over the next two weeks. Sailing from there on 14 October, she first sailed to Halifax and then on to Liverpool, where she arrived on 29 October. The freighter's movements over the next two months are not reported in sources. Timothy Bloodworth was slightly damaged in a V-2 (replica pictured) rocket attack on Antwerp in December 1944. Timothy Bloodworth weathered two attacks in the month of December 1944. In the first attack‚Äîwhich occurred on 16 December, the first day of the German Ardennes Offensive‚Äîthe ship suffered two casualties among her Naval Armed Guard detachment. The location of the ship, manner of attack, and circumstances of the two casualties are unspecified in secondary sources. In the second December attack, Timothy Bloodworth was at anchor in Antwerp later in the month awaiting a New York-bound convoy. At about 14:10 on 24 December, a German V-2 rocket exploded overhead, showering the ship with shrapnel. A short time later, a second rocket hit nearby and more fragments pelted the ship, this time damaging the starboard side of the ship at the number one cargo hold. Although Timothy Bloodworth had a total of 68 people aboard‚Äî8 officers, 33 crewmen, 26 Armed Guard, and 1 passenger‚Äîno one was injured in either attack. Authors Benjamin King and Timothy J. Kutta, in their book Impact: The History of Germany's V-Weapons in World War II, report that Timothy Bloodworth was the first ship to be hit by V-2 fragments during the war. The V-2 damage to Timothy Bloodworth was considered slight, so it did not prevent her from sailing from Antwerp two days later. On 30 December, she left Liverpool for New York and arrived on 13 January 1945. The cargo ship headed south to Hampton Roads and departed for Gibraltar on 7 February. She put in at Gibraltar on 23 February and sailed for Oran. From that port she returned to Hampton Roads on 24 March in convoy GUS 76. Timothy Bloodworth next sailed from New York for Liverpool, Southend, and Antwerp, arriving at the latter port on 30 April. She was at Antwerp on Victory in Europe Day. Timothy Bloodworths last reported movement was in convoy ATM 168 from Antwerp to Southend on 28/29 May.  Postwar career  After the German surrender, the War in the Pacific continued for another three months, but no secondary sources report any participation by Timothy Bloodworth, nor any of the ship's movements or whereabouts over the next two years. At 13:00 on 26 June 1947, Timothy Bloodworth entered the Reserve Fleet at Astoria, Oregon, where she would remain for most of the next 16 years. Timothy Bloodworth was withdrawn from the Reserve Fleet on 6 July 1954. It is not reported where the ship went or whether it was under her own power, but she reentered the fleet on 17 July, loaded with grain. On 29 October 1956, after a little more than two years, she was again withdrawn from the reserve fleet to unload the grain, and was returned empty on 6 November. On 18 September 1963, the United States Maritime Administration (a successor agency to the United States Maritime Commission (USMC)) began accepting bids for the scrap sale of Timothy Bloodworth. The sealed bids were opened on 9 October, and Zidell Explorations, Inc., with its bid of $45,000, was awarded the sale on 10 October.Zidell Explorations purchased a lot of three ships for $135,000 under contract PD-X-646. The other two ships' names are unreported on the Disposal Card. See: On 14 November, Timothy Bloodworth was withdrawn from the reserve fleet for scrapping in Portland, Oregon. The bow section of Timothy Bloodworth, like that of all Liberty ships, was reinforced with concrete for strength. During the scrapping process, however, these sections were not reusable. Timothy Bloodworths bow section was one of nearly 150 buried in the private Liberty Ship Memorial Park on the banks of Portland's Willamette River. In 2006, the park was razed when the land was sold for commercial development.

He was a member of a family that was renowned for sacrificing themselves on the battlefield for Rome. First and second consulship Publius Decius Mus, born the son of the consul of 340 BC Publius Decius Mus, was elected consul in 312 BC together with Marcus Valerius Corvus. When war broke out with the Samnites, Mus had to stay in Rome due to an illness and it was his colleague who was sent to manage the war. When the Etruscans joined in the war on the side of Rome's enemies, Mus was ordered by the Senate to appoint a dictator. In 309 BC he served as a legate under the dictator Lucius Papirius Cursor and the next year he was elected consul again, this time with Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus as his colleague. While his colleague handled the war against Samnium, Mus was entrusted with the war against the Etruscans in which he was so successful that the Etruscans sued for a truce. In 306 BC Mus was appointed as the Master of the Horse to the dictator Publius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus. In 304 BC, Mus and Rullianus were elected censor. In 300 BC Mus successfully espoused the cause of opening the pontificate to the plebeians against Appius Claudius Caecus. Third Samnite War In 297 BC Mus and Rullianus were again elected consul. This time both consuls were to go to Samnium to make war. In this campaign Mus was able to defeat a Samnite army near Maleventum. The next year saw his command in Samnium prorogued as proconsul. The Third Samnite War had thrown up a formidable coalition of Etruscans, Samnites, Umbrians and Gauls against Rome. When Rullianus was unanimously called to the consulship, he stipulated as a condition for accepting that Mus again be his colleague so in 295 BC Mus was elected to a fourth consulship. While Mus was first stationed in Samnium, events up north dictated that both Roman armies be united to face the enemy. When the armies clashed near Sentinum, Publius Decius Mus commanded the left wing of the Roman army. Faced by the Gauls, his troops started giving way under their attacks and Mus followed the example of his father performing a ritual called the Devotio, thereby dedicating himself and the enemy army to the gods of the underworld, then rushing the enemy where he fell in the battle. Publius Decius Mus was the father of the consul of 279 BC, Publius Decius Mus. References *Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita ix. 40, 41, 44, 46, x. 7‚Äî.9, 14‚Äî-17, 22, 24- 26‚Äî29.

The small village is nestled on the shores of the Lake Altaussee, beneath the Loser Plateau. Occupying an area of 92 km¬≤, Altaussee is home to 1,777 people. The municipality includes two cadastral communities: Altaussee and Lupitsch. The designated climatic spa is within the Salzkammergut region. Altaussee has the biggest salt deposits of Austria, which are still mined today. Geography The municipality is located in the small Ausseerland- Region within in the Styrian part of the Salzkammergut in the district of Liezen in Styria. Altaussee covers an area of 92.11 km ¬≤ and is located at 712 m above sea level on the western shore of Lake Altaussee on the southwestern edge of the Totes Gebirge. The community center is located in a valley, which is encircled by mountains. The most noticeable of these peaks are the Loser (1838 m) to the north, the Trisselwand (1755 m) to the east and the Sandling (1717 m) to the west. The highest mountain within the community area is the Schoenberg (2093 m) close to the border with Upper Austria. Due to the alpine location and the strong share of the Totes Gebirge about half of the municipal area consists of alpine wasteland, the rest are forests, grasslands and other land forms. Nearby towns are Bad Aussee, Hallstatt, Bad Goisern, Bad Ischl and Gmunden. =Local geology= The characteristic pale grey mountains which surround Altaussee are made of limestone, a carbonate rock. The age of these rocks are Triassic and Jurassic. The mountains themselves did not form until the Cenozoic, when immense forces between the colliding African and Eurasian plates caused the mountains to be uplifted. The limestones which make up the mountains are white to pale grey in colour, and formed relatively deep in the ancient Tethys ocean. Because the rocks formed so deep, fossils are rare. However, corals are reported from the lower slopes of Loser mountain. Tectonics: a major tectonic fault line runs directly beneath the Lake Altaussee, approximately east‚Äìwest, and terminates in the valley west of the Seewiese. The fault is seismically active, with small earthquakes common. On a hot, clear day in August 1998, a small earthquake on the fault (M=3) caught summer bathers by surprise with a low, rumbling sound and, a few minutes later, unusually high waves. Evaporites: Large evaporite reserves are present in the Sandling mountain, formed as a result of a major period of marine lowstand, when the sea level was low and the sea dried out. Panning and surface-level drift mining of the deposits dates back to Roman times, thanks to evidence from archaeological excavations in the 1990s, followed by similar local works from 200-400 AD.Gerald Grabherr: Michlhallberg.

In 1211 the mines were nationalised by Leopold VI, Duke of Austria, who transferred control to Unterlupitsch. With operations later transferred to Bad Aussee, investment in 1319 allowed the opening of the Steinberg tunnel. Followed by further periods on investment, by 1334, the mines were operated under license by the private Hallinger Union who employed 120 people, producing about 10,000 tonnes of product per annum. Renationalised by Frederick III in 1445, 120 people produced circa 10,00 tonnes of product per annum until the early 20th century. In 1906, a new brine pipeline through the Rettenbach Valley to Bad Ischl to supply the Solvay Works located in the market town of Ebensee. It is for this reason that Altaussee, and other local towns and villages such as Hallstatt, are now part of the Salzkammergut region. Production volumes in the following years quadruple, and employees double to 238. By 1938, the salt mine had come to the attention of Adolf Hitler. Located close to his intended museum complex in Linz, inside the mine the conditions were constant: between 40 and 47 degrees; about 65 percent humidity; with the deepest tunnels more than a mile inside the mountain, safe from enemy bombs. The Nazi's built floors, walls, and shelving as well as a workshop deep in the chambers.http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true- story-monuments-men-180949569/#hQRF14XDqP7S53Ig.99 Post-war after recovery of the art, brine production resumed. The mines are still operational today, and brine is pumped to the market town of Ebensee. In 2008, 61 employees produced 1,506,000m¬≥ of brine, with a salt content of 450,000 tons. It is for this reason that Altaussee, and other local towns and villages such as Hallstatt, are now part of the Salzkammergut region. History Theodor Herzl at Altaussee 1900 The oldest settlement on the ground of the modern village of Altaussee dates back to the Roman rule (200-400 AD). However, there is no historical continuity of a settlement before the Middle Ages. The salt mine on the ground of the modern village was first documented in 1147 AD, the village itself in 1265.Cf.

Band 2 (= Dissertationen der Universit√§t Wien 102). Verband der wissenschaftlichen Gesellschaften √ñsterreichs, Wien 1974, p. 500. Around 1250 Philipp of Spanheim, the Archbishop-elect of Salzburg, occupied the Ausseerland and the Ennstal. For the coverage of his claim to power he built the small Pflindsberg castle on a hill east of the Altaussee village.Reinhard Lamer: Das Ausseer Land. Geschichte und Kultur einer Landschaft. Styria, Graz 1998, p. 31f. He had to withdraw in 1254 and the region returned to Styria. In the following centuries the Pflindsberg castle developed into a regional seignory with the right to hold high justice. It was administered by an official of the styrian Landesf√ºrst.Karl Vocelka: Die Haus- und Hofnamen der Katastralgemeinden Altaussee, Grundlsee, Lupitsch, Obertressen, Reitern und Strassen im Steirischen Salzkammergut.

In 1848 manorialism was abolished in the cisleithanian part of the Austrian Empire and Altaussee became an autonomous political municipality. In the 19th century Altaussee evolved into a popular summer-resort. Especially writers and intellectuals, for example Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Jakob Wassermann, Theodor Herzl and Friedrich Torberg, spent their summer holidays in the small alpine village. = World War II = Memorial plaque for the Austrian plebiscite for the Anschluss on the 10 April 1938, Altaussee 1938 After the annexation of Austria into the German Third Reich in 1938 the entire Ausseerland region (a small region in Styria consisting of Bad Aussee, Grundlsee and Altaussee) was incorporated into the new administrative unit Reichsgau Oberdonau (Upper Austria). The autonomy of the municipalities Bad Aussee, Grundlsee and Altaussee was dissolved and one single B√ºrgermeisterei (mayoralty) was established in Bad Aussee. The municipal offices of Altaussee and Grundlsee were henceforth field offices of Bad Aussee. The 29 country residences in possession of Jewish families were aryanized. In the following time the community attracted many top Nazis who inhabited these aryanized country estates. For example, three Nazi Gauleiter regularly spent their holidays in Altaussee: August Eigruber, Konrad Henlein and Hugo Jury. The Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels spent his holidays in an \\"aryanized\\" country residence at the neighbouring Grundlsee. As of spring 1944, there was a permanent shelter for Wehrmacht deserters, draft dodgers and resisters hidden in the rough terrain of the Totes Gebirge north of the village. This hideout called Igel (hedgehog), was provided with food by trusted third parties in the population. At the end of the war the Igel sheltered 35 people. The Ausseerland region was part of the so-called Alpine fortress. It is for this reason, why 1944/45 it became a last refuge for Nazi party, government and army staffs. Also entire pro-fascist governments that had been used by the Nazis in the Balkans took refuge in the region. As of the end of the war, nine pro-Nazi governments in exile from Eastern Europe stayed in Altaussee. G√ºnther Altenburg for example served as head the Department of Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria and Romania in Altaussee, where he oversaw the Germany-impaired exiled governments of Bulgaria and Romania (see also: Bulgarian government-in- exile). Ernst Kaltenbrunner, head of the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt, moved his headquarters from Berlin to the Villa Kerry in Altaussee in late April 1945. From here, with the help of Wilhelm H√∂ttl, he was trying to contact the Western Allies to reach a separate peace. At the end of the war several high Nazi and SS officials, like August Eigruber, Hugo Jury, Adolf Eichmann,Guy Walters: Hunting evil: the Nazi War criminals who escaped and the quest to bring them to justice.

(commandant of the Sobibor and Treblinka extermination camps) and Anton Burger (Commandant of Theresienstadt concentration camp), tried to go into hiding in the village. On 8 May 1945 a reconnaissance squadron of the U.S. Seventh Army reached the Ausseerland region followed by the main force of the U.S. Army on the next day. Previously to the arrival of the U.S. Army, a self-employed civilian government was formed in Bad Aussee which preserved the order and ensured the supply of the population. Ernst Kaltenbrunner fled to the Wildensee alp nearby Altaussee where he was captured by a U.S. patrol on 12 May 1945. At the end of the war a box of 60 kg Nazi gold was found near the mansion in which Kaltenbrunner had lived. Much of it has been lost since the turmoil of the early post-war days. In the two great wars of the 20th Century, a total of 162 citizens of Altaussee fell as soldiers (44 in World War I and 118 in World War II).Numbers of the fallen citizens according to the death roll of the Altaussee war memorial. On 1 July 1948 the village became part of the Austrian state Styria again. Until 1955 Altaussee was part of the American occupation zone in Austria. Nazi repository for stolen art Altaussee, May 1945 after the removal of the eight 500 kg bombs at the Nazi stolen art repository. During World War II (1943‚Äì1945) the extensive complex of salt mines in Altaussee served as a huge repository for art stolen by the Nazis. These artworks were accumulated under the alias Sonderauftrag Linz (Special Commission: Linz) by Adolf Hitler and were intended for the planned F√ºhrermuseum in Linz, Austria. At the end of the war the entire depot included around 6,500 paintings, as well as many statues, furniture, weapons, coins, and libraries. After the occupation of Altaussee on 8 May 1945 by an American infantry unit, the art depot was seized by the U.S. Army (Monuments Men). Leisure and Sport A 7.5 km trail goes around the clear Lake Altaussee surrounded by 1838 m high Loser mountain the Trisslwand, the Tressenstein and other mountain ranges. Brown and white alpine-style houses with a beautiful church are in the center of town. The tourist bureau has a few English pamphlets, but most information, including the Literatur museum inside, is in German. A saltmine tour through the Altaussee saltmine and the former Nazi Stolen Art Repository is available every hour in the summer. Hiking trails abound, with various gradings. They are marked with green and white signs. The lower ones are easy to follow while the more difficult routes are sometimes less well-marked. A paradise for outdoor enthusiasts and hikers. Flora and waterfalls make the forests and mountains even more attractive in the summer. The 9 km-long Loser Panorama Road leads to a perfect base (1.600 m) for hikes into the heart of the Tote Gebirge Mountain Range. From where the road ends it is only an hours walk to the Loser Peak (1.838 m). In the wintertime the ski resort of Loser offers 29 km slopes with all levels of difficulty. In addition there are other nearby ski resorts available.

Sometimes it is referred to as the moving equilibrium method. For example, assume an industry with a certain capacity that produces a certain commodity. Given this capacity, the supply offered by the industry will depend on the prevailing price. The corresponding supply schedule gives short-run supply. The demand depends on the market price. The price in the market declines if supply exceeds demand, and it increases, if supply is less than demand. The price mechanism leads to market clearing in the short run. However, if this short-run equilibrium price is sufficiently high, production will be very profitable, and capacity will increase. This shifts the short-run supply schedule to the right, and a new short-run equilibrium price will be obtained. The resulting sequence of short-run equilibria are termed temporary equilibria. The overall system involves two state variables: price and capacity. Using the temporary equilibrium method, it can be reduced to a system involving only state variable. This is possible because each short-run equilibrium price will be a function of the prevailing capacity, and the change of capacity will be determined by the prevailing price. Hence the change of capacity will be determined by the prevailing capacity. The method works if the price adjusts fast and capacity adjustment is comparatively slow. The mathematical background is provided by the Moving equilibrium theorem. In physics, the method is known as scale separation, References * (Chapter 3 is on the temporary equilibrium method.) * (This article discusses the separation of time scales in physics.)

Her works have appeared in group exhibitions including Salon Nouveau (curated by Jasper Sharp), Engholm Engelhorn, Vienna; Abstract America, Saatchi Gallery, London; ‚ÄúA Seer Out of Season‚Äù, On Stellar Rays, New York; Cave Painting (curated by Bob Nickas), New York; \\"Purity is a Myth\\", Pilar Corrias Gallery, London; ‚ÄúLiving with Art: Collecting Contemporary in Metro New York‚Äù, The Neuberger Museum, Purchase College, New York, and Prague Biennial 5 (curated by Nicola Trezzi). The author and critic John Reed describes Neel‚Äôs paintings as ‚Äúboldly dismissive of distinctions between abstraction and representation. Landscape and figure grow out of abstraction, and at the same time, decay into abstraction‚Äîan abstraction that represents not so much the geometry of forms as the insanity of perceiving. In this new millennia of painting, Neel has distilled a methodology as fully cognizant of digital imagery and the position of the cinematic camera, as it is of the course of art history. ‚ÄúEvery painting I make is a reference to every painting made before‚Äù, says Neel.\\" In 2010, Fionn Meade curated a solo exhibition of Neel's work, entitled \\"Stick Season\\", at SculptureCenter (Long Island City, NY). As described in the press release, \\"Elizabeth Neel's work relies on a controlled chaos that conflates a palimpsest-like understanding of imagery with a masterful facility for gestural mark making and layered abstraction. A new body of paintings on paper and sculptures extends this tension into three dimensions as found objects, natural artifacts, and studio detritus join with painterly technique to form a series of precarious assemblages. Incorporating organic and mechanistic references, Neel creates a hybrid iconography that tacks between mediums and moods. Resistant to facile representation, empirical observation and still life conventions mix with appropriated imagery, everyday objects, and abstraction in presenting a serial yet disjunctive ambience that is both playful and melancholy, archaic and spontaneous.\\" Neel's work is included in the 2009 Phaidon book \\"Painting Abstraction: New Elements in Abstract Painting\\" by Bob Nickas. She is represented by Salon 94 in New York, Pilar Corrias Gallery in London, and Monica de Cardenas Gallery in Milan. The iconoclastic American portrait painter Alice Neel (1900‚Äì1984) was her grandmother.

The latter is often called a \\"but-for price\\" or a competitive \\"benchmark price\\". When collusion is not in use, such as by privately owned businesses, overcharge is considered as a markup of the observed market price for the sole profit of the business and in some states is considered illegal, similar to profiteering and price gouging. An overcharge may be expressed as a mark-up on the benchmark price, or it may be divided by the observed market price. When the benchmark price is equal to the marginal cost of production, as it is in perfect competition, then ratio of the overcharge to market price is the Lerner Index of market power. When the overcharge is multiplied by the quantity purchased, it becomes the monetary injury or damages incurred by a buyer of goods sold by a cartel. The word is also used (as verb and noun) to describe cases where more than an agreed or standard price is charged for goods or services in a transaction, as when a lawyer bills for more hours than actually worked, a restaurant bill includes items not ordered or is added incorrectly, a builder charges an unreasonable amount for repair work, and so on. Overcharging in this sense may in some cases be a criminal offence (charging for work not done), in others not (a high charge when a price was not agreed). The term is used in a different sense in US legal circles; overcharging in this context is a practice whereby the District Attorney's office in a county initially makes criminal charges against a suspect that exceed what is actually justified by the facts to establish a strong plea bargaining position, with the intention of persuading the suspect to plead guilty to a lesser offence to avoid the perceived risk of being convicted of a more serious crime than was actually committed, with more severe penalty.

The poem was first published in 1921,Buttel, p. 162 so it is free of copyright. Interpretation The doctor of Geneva, perhaps a doctor like John Calvin used to exploring the depths of religious doctrine, is shaken by his encounter with the raw power of the Pacific Ocean. A native of Geneva used to its landlocked lakes, he is also more familiar with Racine's tragedies or Bossuet's rhetoric than the high-rolling waves that pound the shore where he stands. Though professing no awe, he finds that his old European mind suffers an \\"unburgherly apocalypse\\" by his encounter with the art of the New World. Stevens is self-consciously contributing experiments towards a burgeoning American art that may cause traditionalists to use their handkerchiefs and sigh. Vendler sees this as one of Stevens's major themes.Vendler, p. 3 On this reading the poem bears special comparison to The Paltry Nude Starts on a Spring Voyage and Ploughing on Sunday. A letter from Stevens to an Austrian visitor to America returning to his home in Vienna, may be compared to the poem. > I was tempted to improvise a reply to the question regarding food for the > imagination in this country. It is what it is in any country: reality. It is > true that reality over here is different from the reality to which you are > accustomed. It is also true that it not only changes from place to place, > but from time to time and that in every place and at every time the > imagination makes its way by reason of it. This is a simple and unrhetorical > answer to your question. A man is not bothered by the reality to which he is > accustomed, that is to say, in the midst of which he has been born. He may > be very much disturbed by reality elsewhere, but even as to that it would be > only a question of time. You are just as likely as not when you return to > Vienna to be horrified by what you may consider to be extraordinary change > or series of changes.Stevens, pp. 576-7. letter to Victor Hammer, 1948.

He attended Hendon School, then Hendon County School, in North London, where he planted in 1936 an oak tree sapling presented to him, along with his Gold Medal, by Adolf Hitler at the Olympic Games.Harold Whitlock. Sports Reference. Retrieved on 2015-01-23. Whitlock won his first national title in 1933. Two years later, he set a new world record for a 30-mile walk, finishing in 4 hours, 29 minutes, 31.8 seconds. In the same year, he also became the first recorded man to walk between London and Brighton in under eight hours. His main achievement came in 1936, where he won the gold medal in the 50 kilometre walk at the Summer Olympics held in Berlin, Germany, representing Great Britain, finishing in a time of 4 hours, 30 minutes, 41.4 seconds. He gained this victory despite being affected by sickness about 38 kilometres into the race. This sickness, apparently food-related, also affected his fellow British competitors Tebbs Lloyd Johnson and Joe Hopkins. During the 1936 Olympics, oak saplings were given to gold medallists. Rather than planting the oak in his garden, Whitlock offered his as a gift to his former school, Hendon School. The oak remained at the school until 2007, when it had to be removed due to a dangerous amount of rot. He continued to represent Britain at an international level until 1952, when he came 11th at the Helsinki Olympics behind his younger brother Rex, who finished fourth. Competing at the age of 48, Harold Whitlock was Britain's oldest ever international athlete. After this, Whitlock continued as a coach and judge. Notably, he coached Don Thompson, who won gold in the 50 kilometre walking event at the 1960 Olympics. Thompson would eventually take over his world record for the 30 miles (50 kilometre) walk. Whitlock also served as an official at those same Olympics. He died on 27 December 1985 at the age of 82. In 2011, he was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame.

It was referred to as Protection of Persons and Property (Ireland) Act, or with Person in the singular, and/or with (Ireland) omitted. also called the Coercion Act, was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which allowed for internment without trial of those suspected of involvement in the Land War in Ireland. The provisions could be introduced by proclamation of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in any area of the island. Lists of internees had to be laid before Parliament. Enactment William Edward Forster by Henry Tanworth Wells.National Portrait Gallery, London, accessed September 2009 The 1881 act was one of more than 100 Coercion Acts applied to Ireland under the Union. W. E. Gladstone was returned to office in 1880, during the agrarian violence and civil disturbance of the Land War in Ireland. William Edward Forster was made Chief Secretary for Ireland. He carried the Compensation for Disturbance Bill through the Commons, only to see it thrown out in the Lords. On 24 January 1881, he introduced a new Coercion Bill in the Commons. The bill was strongly opposed by the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP), which took its obstructionism tactic to new heights by filibustering the second reading for 41 hours. Eventually the Speaker resorted to ignoring IPP MPs requesting the right of speech and put the question. This controversial unprecedented move was soon formalised when Gladstone secured an amendment of the rules of order to allow for cloture (\\"guillotine\\") motions. After the bill became law in March, The Spectator commented that it had \\"virtually occupied the whole time of the Lower House for seven weeks and a day; for though some part of the discussion was nominally devoted to the Queen's Speech, even that debate hardly turned upon any other subject.\\" Implementation A total of 953 people were detained under the act. Many of them were active in the Irish National Land League; this was sufficient for the \\"reasonable suspicion\\" required by the act. On 13 October 1881, IPP leader Charles Stewart Parnell was arrested under the act after his newspaper, the United Ireland, had attacked the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881.The Times, Arrest of Mr. Parnell, 14 October 1881 The arrest warrant accused Parnell of acting as principal in inciting others to \\"abstain from...pay[ing] rents lawfully due\\". He was interned in Kilmainham Gaol. United Ireland published a No Rent Manifesto the week after Parnell's imprisonment, and the Land League was banned, only to reappear as the Irish National League. Detention of Irish Americans with U.S. citizenship caused a diplomatic row between London and Washington. Ending The act was due to expire 30 September 1882.Protection of Persons and Property Act 1881, section 4 A bill to repeal it was defeated on first reading in February 1882, having been introduced by Thomas Sexton, a signatory of the No Rent Manifesto. Forster proposed renewing the act indefinitely to deal with the crisis, but the rest of the government disagreed, and negotiations began with Parnell. These lead to the \\"Kilmainham Treaty\\", which ended boycotting such that the act was allowed to expire. Both Forster and the Lord Lieutenant, John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer, resigned in May 1882. The act was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1894.

He has 17 other criminal convictions. He was known by various pseudonyms. Early life Dixie was born in Streatham, South London. His parents separated when he was 18 months old. When he was eight, his mother remarried; she had two sons by her new husband. He admits to having been a heavy drinker and user of cannabis and cocaine for years. Criminal record and deportation He has a long criminal record. His first conviction was for robbery ‚Äì he mugged a woman at knifepoint in Stockwell in 1986, for which he was sentenced to six weeks' detention. In 1987, he moved to Sidcup and was convicted of burglary and robbery. In 1988, he was convicted of indecent assault and indecent exposure and sentenced to two years' probation. Later in 1988, he was convicted of indecent assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In 1989, he was convicted of indecent exposure and sentenced to 80 hours' community service. In 1990, he was convicted of assaulting a police officer. Dixie lived in Australia from 1993 and overstayed his visa. He was deported in 1999 after being convicted of a sex offence, for which he was fined. Dixie was accused of a sexual assault in 2001, where it is believed he masturbated in front of a woman in a telephone booth. He was not prosecuted for this. Personal life Dixie has three sons. Murder conviction Sally Anne Bowman was stabbed to death yards from her home after a night out with friends. Dixie worked as a chef at the Ye Old Six Bells in Horley, Surrey. His DNA was taken when he was arrested in Crawley, West Sussex, after being involved in a fight in a pub while watching a World Cup football match almost a year later, and matched with DNA found on the body of Sally Anne Bowman. In October 2006, Dixie's DNA was sent to Western Australia to be tested against that of the DNA evidence in the Claremont serial killer case between 1996 and 1997, as it is believed he was in the area at the time of the killings, and may have committed them. At his trial for the murder of Sally Anne Bowman, an unnamed Thai woman gave evidence that Dixie had stabbed and raped her in Australia in 1998; Dixie has yet to be formally charged with this attack, though a DNA sample from the woman's underwear has been matched to him. Dixie denied the murder but, as part of his defence, claimed that he had spent the night on drink and drugs and had gone out to buy more cocaine. He claimed to have come across the body of Sally Anne Bowman, who was already dead, he said, by a third party, and had sex with her after she was killed. In 2007, Dixie's DNA was matched to the rape of a woman in Fuengirola, Spain, in August 2003. A Dutchman ‚Äì Romano van der Dussen ‚Äì had already been sentenced to 15 years in prison for this rape and two sexual assaults that were committed nearby and in the same way as the rape. By 2015, van der Dussen was still in prison and Dixie not yet charged with the rape In June 2015, the Dutch newspaper the Volkskrant reported that Dixie confessed to this rape, but not to the two sexual assaults. van der Dussen was finally exonerated and freed in February 2016 after spending over 12 years in prison. Dixie was found guilty of murdering Sally Anne Bowman on 22 February 2008 and was sentenced to life imprisonment at the Old Bailey, where Judge Gerald Gordon recommended that Dixie should not be released for a minimum of 34 years, by which time he will be 70 years old. This means he is likely to remain in prison until at least 2040. Following Dixie's conviction, Detective Superintendent Stuart Cundy, who had led the Bowman investigation, said: \\"It is my opinion that a national DNA register ‚Äì with all its appropriate safeguards ‚Äì could have identified Sally Anne's murderer within 24 hours. Instead it took nearly nine months before Mark Dixie was identified, and almost two-and-a-half years for justice to be done.\\" The calls for such a register were, however, turned down by ministers and other politicians who claimed that it would raise practical as well as civil liberties issues. Dixie confessed to the murder in January 2015. Rape convictions In 2017, Dixie was convicted of two rapes ‚Äì one of which happened in 1986 and the other in 2002. He received two life sentences.

At the 2006 census, Highbury had a population of 493. History Like many towns, Highbury came into existence with the construction of the Great Southern Railway, when a siding was built here in 1894. Highbury was originally called Wolwolling, after Wolwolling Pool, a permanent pool in the bed of the Arthur River 7 km to the south-southeast. It was gazetted under that name in 1905, but the local progress association complained that the name was too similar to others, causing letters and goods to go astray to other places. At a public meeting the names submitted to ballot were Highbury, Scottdale, and Linton. Linton was the preferred name, however it was renamed Highbury from August 1906. The Wolwolling State School was opened in 1904, with a permanent school building and teacher's quarters constructed in 1905. The school operated until 1946. Present day The town today is little more than a stop on the highway, with a store, tavern and hall utilised by the surrounding agricultural district in the southern Shire of Narrogin. A group called Highbury District Community Council report to council on issues affecting the area, and in 2006 successfully proposed the construction of a war memorial next to the hall to honour those from the district who had fought and died overseas.

The church provided clothes and shoes and the team was required to attend mass. The team, known at the time as Renaissance, won the Brazzaville city championship each year from 1945 to 1950 led by team-captain Dominique Sombo. They played at Ebou√© stadium, which was owned by the mission. =Controversy= The players, being colonized, were not compensate at all for their efforts. The mission would collect money at the gates, and did not pay for medical treatment or transport to games. In 1951, the players decided to write to the Director of Social Services to request to leave the mission and to be sponsored by a cultural center. After threatening to boycott colonial administrators assuaged their demands to avoid popular outcry. Renaissance won another city championship and independence from the FAC. To celebrate their new autonomy, the team changed their name to L‚Äô√âtoile, in respect to a star Brazzaville team from the 1930s. The name Renaissance was given to reserve team of younger players.

Burnett was elected governor almost one year before California's admission to the United States as the 31st state in September 1850, and was the last governor during the interim period that began with US military occupation during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War.California was never a U.S. Territory; it was occupied territory under military authority. A new representative government began when California ratified its Constitution in 1849 and Gov. Burnett took office following the election in November, as the 33rd governor in the continuous sequence since Portol√°. Early life Burnett was born in Nashville, Tennessee, but raised in rural Missouri. He was raised in a family of slave owners, later owning two of his own. In 1828, he married Harriet Rogers. Burnett did not receive any formal education aside from elementary school, but educated himself in law and government. After owning a general store, he turned to his law career. Defending a group of Mormons‚Äîincluding Joseph Smith‚Äîwho were accused of treason, arson and robbery, Burnett requested a change of venue for the court proceedings. During transportation to the next venue, the defendants escaped. =His move to the West= In 1843, having failed as a merchant and heavily in debt, Burnett became part of the exodus of Easterners moving westward, moving his family to Oregon Country (now modern- day Oregon) to take up farming in order to solve growing debts in Missouri, an agricultural endeavor that failed. While in Oregon Country, Burnett began his forays into politics, getting elected to the provisional legislature between 1844 and 1848. In 1844, he completed construction of Germantown Road between the Tualatin Valley and what became Portland.Baron, Connie and Michelle Trappen. Paths linking past and present. The Oregonian, March 6, 2008. It was during his time in Oregon that Burnett, a traditional Southern Protestant, began to question the practices of his faith, his religious views drifting more to Roman Catholicism. By 1846, Burnett and his family made the complete transition from Protestant to become Catholic. While in the Legislature, and later as Provisional Supreme Judge, Burnett signed Oregon's first exclusion laws. Under an 1844 law passed by the provisional government‚Äîjust after the same government abolished slavery‚Äîslave holders could keep their slaves for up to three years, after which all black people, free or slave, had to leave Oregon Country or face flogging. Upon news of the discovery of gold in Coloma, California on January 24, 1848, Burnett and his family moved south to participate in the rush. After modest success in getting gold, Burnett envisioned a career in law in San Francisco, a rapidly growing boomtown thanks largely to the Gold Rush. On the way to the Bay Area, Burnett met John Augustus Sutter, Jr., son of German-born Swiss pioneer John Sutter. Selling his father's deeded lands in the near vicinity of Sutter's Fort, the younger Sutter offered Burnett a job in selling land plots for the new town of Sacramento. Over the next year, Burnett made nearly US$50,000 in land sales in Sacramento, a city ideally suited due to its closeness to the Sierra Nevada and the neighboring Sacramento River's navigability for large ships. In 1848, Burnett was among those who founded the city of Oregon City in Butte County, California.http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=21391 Governorship Portrait of Burnett by William F. Cogswell In 1849, Burnett announced his intentions to return to politics. 1849 saw the first California Constitutional Convention in Monterey, where territorial politicians drafted documents suitable to admit California as a state in the United States. During the 1849 referendum to adopt the California Constitution, Burnett, now with name recognition in Sacramento and San Francisco, and a resume that included the Oregon Provisional Legislature, decided to run for the new territory's first civilian governor, replacing the string of military governors and bureaucracy from the U.S. military. Burnett easily won the election over four other candidates, including John Sutter, and was sworn in as California's first elected civilian governor on December 20, 1849 in San Jose in front of what would soon (after statehood in 1850) become the California State Legislature. =The Burnett Administration= In the first days of the Burnett Administration, the governor and the California Legislature set out to create the organs of a state government, creating state cabinet posts, archives, executive posts and departments, subdividing the state into 27 counties and appointing John C. Fremont and William M. Gwin as California's senators to the federal U.S. Senate. Despite home proclamations and bureaucratic reorganizations that recognized California now as a U.S. state, the U.S. Congress and President Zachary Taylor had in fact not even signed authorization of statehood for California. Part of this miscommunication was due to California's relative remoteness to the rest of the U.S. during the time, but also to over-enthusiastic attitudes by politicians and the public alike to get California into the Union as quickly as possible. Following long contentious debates in the U.S. Senate, California was admitted as a (non- slave) state on September 9, 1850 as part of the Compromise of 1850. Californians did not learn of their official statehood until one month later, when on October 18, the steamer Oregon entered San Francisco Bay, with a banner strapped to her rigging reading \\"California Is a State\\". During those advancements into statehood, Burnett's popularity among the legislature, the press, and the public plummeted. Relations between the Legislature and Burnett began to immediately sour in early 1850, when bills pressing for the incorporation of Sacramento and Los Angeles as city municipalities, with Los Angeles being a special incorporation due to its earlier pueblo status during the previous Spanish and Mexican rule, passed the State Assembly and Senate. Burnett vetoed both bills, citing special incorporation bills as unconstitutional and that reviews for municipal incorporation were best left to county courts. The legislature failed to override Burnett's veto of the Los Angeles bill but succeeded in overriding the Sacramento bill making it California's first incorporated city. For California's legal system, Burnett recommended to the first session of the state legislature that California should implement a hybrid legal system mixing significant elements of both civil law and common law. He advocated for enacting California versions of the Louisiana Civil Code and the Louisiana Code of Practice (Louisiana's name for what Americans would call a code of civil procedure), and adopting American common law for crimes, evidence, and commercial law. This touched off an uproar among the American lawyers who had flocked to California, with the majority pushing for common law and a minority (led by John W. Dwinelle) advocating adoption of civil law. The Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Elisha Oscar Crosby, published a report in February 1850 recommending adoption of the common law through the enactment of a reception statute; Burnett signed the resulting bill into law on April 13, 1850. Characterized as an aloof politician with little support from the Legislature by the San Francisco, Sacramento and Los Angeles press, Burnett grew frustrated as his agenda ground to a halt, and his governance style was increasingly criticized. He became a regular fixture of ridicule in the state's newspapers and on the floor of the Legislature. With little over a year in office, Burnett, the first governor of the state, became the first to resign, announcing his resignation in January 1851. Burnett cited personal matters for his departure. Lieutenant Governor John McDougall replaced Burnett as the Governor of California on 9 January. =His policies= As in Oregon, Burnett pushed for the exclusion of blacks from California, raising the ire of pro-slavery supporters who wanted to import the Southern slave system to the West Coast, but his proposals were defeated in the legislature. From Burnett's First Annual Message to the Legislature, December 21, 1849:\\"First Annual Message of the Governor of the State of California\\" (San Francisco), Daily Alta California, 26 December 1849, 1 (this address should not be confused with Burnett's Inaugural Address, which can also be found in this issue). Similarly, Burnett also pushed for heavy taxation on foreign immigrants. An 1850 Foreign Miners Tax Act, signed into law by Burnett, required every miner of non-American origin to pay US$20. Burnett also argued heavily for increased taxation and for the expansion of capital punishment to include larceny. Burnett also attempted to remove Native Americans as well as foreign miners. In 1851, federal commissioners negotiated treaties with Native tribes in California, which were then blocked by the governor for being too generous in reserving land for the tribes. Instead, the greed for gold wealth led to a second option, which he called a \\"war of extermination\\". He declared that warfare would not cease with Native Americans \\"until the Indian race becomes extinct\\"Hine, Robert V. and Mack Faragher, John, The American West: A New Interpretative History, (Yale University Press: 2000), pp. 249. Accessed July 26, 2020. Post-governorship Picture taken in his later years, when he served as president of Pacific Bank. One year after leaving the governorship, Burnett was finally able to repay the heavy debts he had incurred in Missouri nearly two decades before. He entered a number of careers, serving briefly as a justice in the California Supreme Court between 1857 and 1858, the Sacramento City Council, as well as becoming a San Jose- based lawyer, a noted proponent of Catholicism during the Victorian period, and then the president of the Pacific Bank of San Francisco. Although never venturing into politics much after the 1860s, Burnett was an active supporter of the federal Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. In 1880, he published an autobiography, Recollections and Opinions of an Old Pioneer. He died May 17, 1895 at the age of 87 in San Francisco, and is buried in the Santa Clara Mission Cemetery at Santa Clara, California. Legacy Burnett's legacy is largely mixed. While regarded as one of the fathers of modern California in the state's early days, his open-racist attitudes towards blacks, Chinese, and Native Americans have tarnished his name today. Burnett's period in the Oregon Provisional Legislature helped facilitate the exclusion of blacks from the state until 1926. In 1844, one of his Oregon proposals was to force free blacks to leave the state and to institute floggings of any who continued to remain. Referred to as \\"Burnett's lash law\\", it was deemed \\"unduly harsh\\", and it was never enforced, voters rescinding it in 1845. Also, his open hostility to foreign laborers influenced a number of federal and state California legislators to push future xenophobic legislation, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act, 30 years after his departure from the governorship. Burnett was also an open advocate of exterminating local California Indian tribes, a policy that continued with successive state governmental administrations for several decades, which offered US$10 to US$25 for evidence of dead Natives. From Burnett's Second Annual Message to the Legislature, January 7, 1851:\\"The Governor's Message (Transmitted January 7, 1851)\\", Sacramento Transcript, 10 January 1851, 2. San Francisco's Burnett Avenue near the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood is named after him. The Burnett Child Development Center, a preschool in a predominantly black San Francisco neighborhood, had been named for Burnett. However, when Burnett's racist positions were rediscovered, the school was renamed in 2011 to the Leola M. Havard Early Education School, in honor of San Francisco's first African-American principal. Similarly, the Peter H. Burnett Elementary School in Long Beach has been recently renamed, due to Burnett's views. It is now named after Bobbi Smith, the first African- American member of the Long Beach Unified School District's board.

Biography Born in Jaboat√£o dos Guararapes, on the Northeast side of Brazil, Britto lived and grew up among a big family of eight brothers and sisters. However, his innate creativity allowed Britto to fill his life with images of a bigger and more beautiful world beyond his own at an early age, he painted what he saw and what he imagined on surfaces such as newspapers, cardboard or any scraps that he could find. With an inordinate passion to excel, he prospered academically. Still, Britto's artistic nature eventually led him to seek experiences outside the classroom. In 1983, Britto went to Paris, France where he was introduced to the works of Matisse and Picasso, Britto was encouraged to travel to the United States where Pop Art was flourishing.Britto's Website 2015 Britto has lived in Miami, Florida since 1989. Shortly after Britto arrived in the United States, Michel Roux, founder of Absolute Vodka's Absolute Art Ad Campaign, happened to stop by Britto's first studio in Coconut Grove, Florida. Roux quickly asked Britto to reinterpret the famous bottle, which would be published and seen by millions. Britto was part of major international art fairs, among them were FIAC Paris and Art Salon Hong Kong. His exhibitions were shown around the globe some of which were the 2016 Presidential campaign of Governor Jeb Bush as well as for Monsanto, Bain Capital, Movado, Philip Morris, Academi (formerly Blackwater), Disney, Enrico Coveri, Pepsi, the United Nations, BMW, and Royal Caribbean Cruises.Minkara 2004 Britto has one main art gallery in Miami, on South Beach on Lincoln Road.

Bush's campaign during the 1988 United States presidential election. Along with the racially-charged Willie Horton (\\"Weekend Passes\\") commercial, it is considered to have been a major factor in Bush's defeat of Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis. The ad was produced by political consultant Roger Ailes with help from Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater, and first aired on October 5, 1988. \\"Revolving door syndrome\\" is a term used in criminology to refer to recidivism; however, in the ad, the implication is that prison sentences were of an inconsequential length. Synopsis The ad shows a line of convicts (portrayed by actors) casually walking in and out of a prison (filmed in Draper, Utah) by means of a revolving door. The narration states that as governor of Massachusetts, Dukakis vetoed mandatory minimum sentencing for drug dealers, that he vetoed the death penalty, and that he gave weekend furloughs to first-degree murderers. The narrator goes on to point out that while furloughed, many of the convicts committed crimes including kidnapping and rape, and are still at large. The ad concludes with the phrase: \\"Now Michael Dukakis says he wants to do for America what he's done for Massachusetts. America can't afford that risk.\\" The disclaimer at the end indicates the ad was paid for and endorsed by the Bush/Quayle campaign. Impact A CBS News/New York Times poll showed that of all of the political ads of the 1988 presidential campaign, this one had the greatest impact on respondents. The percentage of poll respondents who felt Bush was \\"tough enough\\" on crime rose from 23 percent in July 1988 to 61 percent in late October 1988 while the proportion saying Dukakis was \\"not tough enough\\" on crime rose from 36 to 49 percent during the same period. The ad itself was first shot with real prisoners. But as they included \\"too many blacks\\", the ad was reshot with actors, including only \\"one or two\\" black men. Many, such as Jesse Jackson, called the \\"Revolving Door\\" ad racist. Furlough program The original State inmate furlough program, for which convicted first-degree murderers were ineligible, was actually signed into law by Republican Governor Francis W. Sargent in 1972. After the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that this right extended to first-degree murderers, the Massachusetts legislature quickly passed a bill prohibiting furloughs for such inmates. However, in 1976, Dukakis vetoed this bill. The program remained in effect through the intervening term of governor Edward J. King and was abolished during Dukakis' final term of office on April 28, 1988. This abolition only occurred after the Lawrence Eagle Tribune had run 175 stories about the furlough program and won a Pulitzer Prize. Dukakis continued to argue that the program was 99 percent effective; yet, as the Lawrence Eagle Tribune pointed out, no state outside of Massachusetts, nor any federal program, would grant a furlough to a prisoner serving life without parole.

The figure of Judith is believed to be a self-portrait. Fede Galizia, better known as Galizia, (c. 1578‚Äì c.1630) was an Italian Renaissance painter of still-lifes, portraits, and religious pictures. She is especially noted as a painter of still-lifes of fruit, a genre in which she was one of the earliest practitioners in European art.  Life  Fede Gallizia was born in Milan most likely sometime before 1578. Her father, Nunzio Galizia, also a painter of miniatures, had moved to Milan from Trento. Fede (whose name means \\"faith\\") learned to paint from him. By the age of twelve, she was sufficiently accomplished as an artist to be mentioned by Gian Paolo Lomazzo, a painter and art theorist friend of her father, who wrote, \\"[T]his girl dedicates herself to imitate the most extraordinary of our art.\\"Gian Paolo Lomazzo, Idea del tempio della pittura, Milan 1590, p. 163, \\"dandosi all'imitazion de i pi√π eccellenti dell'arte nostra.\\" At a young age, Galizia was already an established portrait painter handling many commissioned works. Perhaps it was her father's influence as a miniaturist that led to Galizia's attention to detail in her portraits. Her treatment of jewels and clothing made her a very desirable portrait painter. She was often commissioned to paint religious and secular themes as well. Several of her paintings based on the deuterocanonical story of Judith and Holofernes, a popular theme in art of the period, survive in private collections. Perhaps her earliest was Judith with the Head of Holofernes painted in 1596 which is now in Sarasota Florida at the Ringling Museum of Art. She also created miniatures and altarpieces for convents. Galizia never married. On June 21, 1630, she made her will and is thought to have died of the plague in Milan shortly afterward.Segal 1998.  Style  Peaches in a pierced white faience basket (1578‚Äì1630) Portrait of Paolo Morigia (1592‚Äì1596) Close-up of reflection in the glass lenses of Portrait of Paolo Morigia (1596) The style of her painting derived from the naturalistic traditions of the Renaissance in Italy with a sharply realistic approach. Galizia's artistic skills are evident in her portrait of Paolo Morigia, a Jesuit scholar, writer and historian, and one of her earliest patrons and supporters. Her 1596 Portrait of Paolo Morigia depicts the subject writing a poem about the picture Galizia was painting. She received several public commissions for altarpieces in Milanese churches, including the Noli me tangere (1616; Milan, S Stefano) made for the altar of Santa Maria Maddalena Church. When not painting portraits, Galizia was primarily interested in painting still lifes, a genre in which she was a pioneer and for which she is best remembered. Although very few contemporary sources mention Galizia's still life paintings, they are the majority of her surviving works. Sixty-three works have been catalogued as hers, of which 44 are still lifes. One of her signed still lifes made in 1602 is the first known dated still life by an Italian artist.Harris, A. (2003). \\"Galizia, Fede\\". Grove Art Online. However, her paintings were not given the recognition they deserved until well into the 20th century, when special attention was given to her work in studies made in 1963 and 1989. Galizia shows a style related to the Lombard mannerism of the late 16th century, centered in Mantua, but known internationally, especially in France. Galizia‚Äôs still lifes are among the earliest examples of painting in a new genre in which women, partly because they were excluded from other kinds of painting, would excel. Galizia‚Äôs still lifes differ from her father's works in their greater detail and more vibrant colors. Most of these works featured fruit centerpieces in simple, frontal arrangements. They were often composed of a basket or bowl filled with a single type of fruit, such as peaches or pears, with a few fruit, sometimes sliced, scattered at the base of the bowl. Many of her still lifes had fresh flowers or other fruits set on the counter to provide a noticeable contrast and scale as seen in her work titled, Still-life with Peaches and a Porcelain and a Bowl. Galizia's work displayed the influence of such works as Caravaggio's Basket of Fruit. Associating with the more restrained style of the Counter Reformation period, she did not explore the more lavish compositions and forms taken up by many of her contemporaries working in this genre; she preferred instead a severe compositional style like that seen in Francisco de Zurbar√°n's slightly later still life paintings. Portrait of Federico Zuccari (1604) Galizia‚Äôs paintings were deft with detail, perfectly balanced, and her attention to shadow, light, and texture was unrivaled at the time. She was particularly good at creating inviting space in her paintings. Her compositions are not crowded. They look as if one could reach out and touch the fruit, grasp it, and pull it from the painting without disturbing the rest of the work. Her graceful, flowing arrangements were natural and poetic. Portrait of Paolo Morigia (1596) was painted when Galizia was only eighteen. Each detail of the figure is painted in analytic detail. Galizia employs mimesis (imitation of reality), in the depiction of Morigia‚Äôs glasses: lenses' reflection shows the room Morigia is sitting in, and thus heightening the illusion of reality. Galizia is recognized as a pioneer in the treatment of still-life in European painting. Currently, it is unknown the number of paintings Galizia executed. Many works that could have possibly been hers have been attributed to her male counterpart Panfilo Nuvolone, who drew significant inspiration from Galizia. She may have inspired the Bergamese Francesco Codino and the Baroque still life painter Giovanna Garzoni.

Her family fled the Nazi regime, and she arrived in the U.S. in 1939 at the age of 15. She worked as a literary critic and taught at the University of Chicago, Elmhurst College and Goddard College. She began writing poetry in the 1950s and published her first collection in 1965, after years of self-study. She received awards including the National Book Award in 1981 and the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1997, as the only German-born poet awarded that prize.  Life and career  Mueller was born Elisabeth Neumann in Hamburg. Her father, Fritz C. Neumann, was a teacher at the . He was a progressive educator and delivered a speech in 1933 to an assembly of Hamburg teachers, warning of the dangers of Nazi ideology. When the Nazis came to power, he was dismissed. Her mother, Ilse (Burmester), an elementary teacher, sustained the family. In 1935, her father was interrogated by the Gestapo for four days. He emigrated, first to Italy, then to the U.S., where he was accepted in 1937 as a political refugee. He became a professor of French and German at Evansville College. She followed with her mother and her younger sister Ingeborg, arriving on 9 June 1939. In the U.S., she used the name Lisel. She graduated from the University of Evansville in 1944. Her mother died in 1953, and she then began to write poetry, publishing the first small collection, Dependencies, in 1965 after twelve years of self-studies. In 1943, she married Paul Mueller. The couple built a home in rural Lake Forest, Illinois, in the 1960s, and she wrote: \\"Though my family landed in the Midwest, we lived in urban or suburban environments\\". They raised two daughters, Lucy and Jenny. She made money by working as a receptionist in a doctor's office and writing book reviews for the Chicago Daily News, which hired her in the 1970s. Mueller taught at the University of Chicago, Elmhurst College in Illinois, Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont, and Warren Wilson College. She stopped publishing after her husband died in 2001 and her vision deteriorated. During her last years, Mueller resided in a retirement community in Chicago, Illinois. She died on February 21, 2020, at the age of 96.  Books  = Poetry = Mueller's poems often depart from seemingly simple observations. While her work is in English, it reflects her German roots. She sometimes alludes to German fairy- tales by the Brothers Grimm, and quotes Bertold Brecht. In her 1992 autobiographical poem \\"Curriculum Vitae\\", she writes: \\"My country was struck by history more deadly than earthquakes or hurricanes\\". Her poems have been described as extremely accessible, yet intricate and layered. While at times whimsical and possessing a sly humor, there is an underlying sadness in much of her work.Lisel Mueller at Western Illinois University Web site, accessed October 29, 2006Curriculum Vitae by Lisel Mueller 1992 at Academy of American Poets Web site, accessed October 29, 2006 * Dependencies (1965) * Life of a Queen (1970) by Northeast/Juniper Books * The Private Life (1975) Lamont Poetry Selection * Voices from the Forest (1977) * The Need to Hold Still (1980) ‚Äî winner of the National Book Award * Second Language (1986) * Waving from Shore (1989) * Learning to Play by Ear (1990) * Alive Together: New & Selected Poems (1996) ‚Äî winner of the Pulitzer Prize = Translation = She has published several volumes of translation, including * Selected Later Poems of Marie Luise Kaschnitz (1980) * Circe's Mountain, stories by Marie Luise Kaschnitz (1990)  Awards  * 1975: Lamont Poetry Prize for The Private Life * 1981: National Book Award for Poetry for The Need to Hold Still \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1981\\".

The river valley (dale) gave its name to the Ryedale shire district, which extends southwest into the Vale of Pickering along the River Derwent. River Rye near Nunnington, swollen after heavy rain. Course Church Bridge at Hawnby crossing the upper reaches of the River Rye. The river rises at Rye Head near Snilesworth Lodge on Snilesworth Moor in the Cleveland Hills and collects the River Seph which flows along Bilsdale. It passes Rievaulx Abbey and enters the Vale of Pickering at Helmsley. In its eastward course from Helmsley, the Rye receives the River Dove from Farndale which has previously added the Hodge Beck from Bransdale. Hodge Beck is partly swallowed by the limestone aquifer in Kirkdale and issues again further down the valley. Kirkbymoorside is on the River Dove which, like Hodge Beck has a partly subterranean course. Rosedale sends down the River Seven which comes by Sinnington to join the Rye. The steep-sided Newtondale gives Pickering Beck which joins the Costa Beck before it enters the River Rye just before its mouth into River Derwent. Areas For management purposes the River Rye is divided into two units, Ness and Howe Bridge. =Ness= Ness is the upstream area and covers . It covers the River Rye and its tributaries from its source to its confluence with the River Dove near the village of East Ness. The Ness area is mainly rural with dispersed settlements. It has varied topography, the northern part is dominated by upland moors which are over in height in the North York Moors National Park. Here the land use is largely managed grassland. Downstream, as the river approaches Rievaulx and Helmsley the land is around in height and falls to at East Ness. In the lower part, land use is a mixture of managed grassland and arable farming with pockets of forestry and woodland close to the river. Abstraction from the river is mainly to supply a fish farm at Harome and this water is returned to the river. Wastewater treatment works have been built at Helmsley and Sproxton. The ecology and fisheries are highly sensitive to changers in water flow. =Howe Bridge= The Howe Bridge area covers . It covers the River Rye from East Ness to its confluence with the River Derwent just beyond Howe Bridge. In this area the main tributaries are the River Riccal, River Dove (with Hodge Beck), River Seven, Costa Beck and Pickering Beck. The market towns of Pickering and Kirkbymoorside are the largest settlements. Otherwise the area is rural with a varied topography. To the north is the upland moorland of the North York moors with the valleys of Bransdale, Farndale, Rosedale and Newtondale. Much of the moorland is over in height with the highest point being . To the south the tributaries from the valleys converge and the land becomes flatter. It is mainly lower than . To the south-west the Howe Bridge area covers the undulating landscape of the Howardian Hills. The largest abstractions are for fish farming. Wastewater treatment works are at Pickering, Harome and Kirkbymoorside. Geology At source the River Rye and its tributaries run over Corallian limestone which outcrops on the hills surrounding the Vale of Pickering. In places the major aquifer is exposed in the river bed and river water is lost through swallow holes at Kirkdale and Kirkby Mills. Beneath the course of the Rye and its tributaries in the Vale of Pickering lie the lacustrine deposits from the last ice age. Newtondale was a melt water channel draining the North York Moors at the end of the ice age and its valley is much more deeply incised than the flow of the present Pickering Beck would suggest. History Rye Valley at Rievaulx Abbey The upland streams of the Rye and its tributaries have powered water mills for centuries. There were three mills at Pickering and others at Kirkby Mills, near Kirkbymoorside. A mill at Bransdale is owned by the National Trust, though not open to visitors. Rievaulx Abbey was established on the banks of the Rye on land given by Walter l'Espec of Helmsley and took its name from a literal translation of Rye Valley from the French. The monks of Rievaulx diverted the river away from the abbey buildings. On the Costa Beck south of Pickering traces of a prehistoric settlement were excavated in the late-19th century. Economy The main economic value of the River Rye lies in its use as a water source for agriculture, domestic supply, fisheries and leisure pursuits. It also drains the water discharged by wastewater treatment works. Nature protection Farndale is a Site of Special Scientific Interest There are many sites in the Rye catchment area which have designated status. North York Moors are designated as a Special Protection Area, providing protection to birds, their nests, eggs and habitats and a Special Area of Conservation, contributug to biodiversity by maintaining and restoring habitats and species other than birds. Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the area include Farndale; Cropton Banks and Howlgate Head Woods; Newton Dale; The Ings of Amotherby; Duncombe Park; Ashberry and Reins Woods; Rievaulx Woods; Ryedale Windy Pits and North York Moors. Duncombe Park is a National Nature Reserve (NNR), while the Howardian Hills are an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

A period as a public puppeteer led him to take a position teaching crafts through the WPA. This led to other positions in the WPA, and it was through one of these roles, as a field supervisor of craft programs, that he again met Mary, who was directing a ceramics studio at the Big Stone Gap Federal Art Gallery in Abingdon, Virginia. They were married on August 19, 1937, eventually resigned their posts with the WPA, and after a period as itinerant puppeteers, established a long-term partnership as fine ceramicists.Phoenix New Times - Arts - Four Hands, One Heart  New Hampshire  As the Scheiers learned to collaborate, with Edwin's sculptural work being bonded to Mary's thrown works, their reputations grew. They received an offer to take positions at the University of New Hampshire, where Mary became Artist-in-Residence. The couple taught there for over 20 years before moving to Mexico to study Oaxacan Indian arts and crafts. During the summer of 1945, the Scheiers were invited to travel to Puerto Rico to train ceramic arts students, for a small pottery that the Puerto Rican government intended to establish. The Scheiers visited briefly, after which an administrator of the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company, or PRIDECO, traveled in America with Edwin, learning more about the ceramics industry.  Oaxaca  The Scheiers spent most of the 1960s in Oaxaca.University of New Hampshire Library - Milne Special Collection & Archives - Scheier Pottery Collection They examined, studied, and learned the techniques of the Zapotec peoples in weaving, painting, sculpture, and pottery. Many of Edwin's themes are enhanced in these mediums by the play of positive and negative space.  Later life  After years in Oaxaca, the Scheiers returned to the United States, settling in Green Valley, Arizona, where Edwin and Mary resided until their deaths. Until about a year before his death Edwin continued to create art work, though due to age and health, he was then creating \\"computer paintings\\" in his studio. The computer paintings came about primarily out of frustration and his deep desire to create. Though his heart would no longer allow him to lift heavy blocks of clay, his mind was still active. On an impulse he went to a computer store, purchased a computer, a color ink jet printer, and a graphical sketch pad - from this he began to create what he would call \\"computer paintings.\\" As with pottery, his use of the computer was self-taught. Here was a man in his early 90s starting a new artistic method. He did not ask for help, he just did it. Filmmaker Ken Browne examined the lives and works of the Scheiers in his 2000 documentary, Four Hands, One Heart. Mary died in May 2007 at 99.Heydarpour, Roja Mary Scheier, 99, Creator of Elegant Pottery, Is Dead.The New York Times, May 19, 2007. Accessed May 19, 2007. Edwin died less than a year later in April 2008 at the age of 97. About 40 pieces of the Scheirs' work are on display at the University of New Hampshire Library, and the couple's work is also found in the permanent collection of the Currier Museum of Art and the Herberger College of the Arts at Arizona State University. Their works have also been shown at the Newark Museum, Minneapolis Institute of Arts, and the Cranbrook Art Museum.  Themes and motifs  Edwin Scheier's work often employed symbols for life, birth, and rebirth. The figures applied to the thrown vessels often involve people within people, womb-like, or within animals. Scheier often utilized stylistic techniques learned during his time in Oaxaca. His designs were often compared to those of Pablo Picasso and Paul Klee but ultimately, as an artist, they were his own. In 1988, Edward Lebow described Scheier's figure work as showing ‚Äúthe humorous lyrical primitivism of the personal subconscious.‚Äù Notes References * American Potters: Mary and Edwin Scheier by Michael K.

They currently play in Malawi's TNM super league. History The BE FORWARD Wanderers F.C is one of the more successful teams in the Malawi Premier Division, based in Blantyre. They have won 6 titles in the league, and they are the current defending Champions as of January, 2018. In 2005 and 2006 their leading striker, Aggrey Kanyenda was the top goal scorer in the 2005‚Äì06 season. They boast to have the second largest support base after their arch rivals and sworn enemies on the field Big Bullets. Even though there are no real stats on the number of fans the two teams have, it is estimated that Big Bullets have a slightly bigger fan base than Wanderers. The most popular striker to have played in this club is Yasin Osman the current head coach. The most serving player is Joseph Kamwendo who has played for the team from early 2000s up to 2018/19 Recent memorable derbys The rivalry between Big Bullets and BE FORWARD wanderers starts to kick off every time both clubs meet in 2006‚Äì07 both clubs met wanderers went ahead in the first half. Deep second half Bullets scored a goal but it was offside. The Bullets fans went angry started throwing things on to the pitch and the ref in charge abandoned the game, Wanderers had won that match 3‚Äì0 because of disqualification. The two teams have met domestic in cup finals few times since the early 1990s, most notably the 1999 Malawi Carlsberg Cup final. The match ended 1‚Äì1 after 90 minutes and went to extra time, Wanderers scored a dramatic golden goal to lift the cup. Few years later Bullets got their revenge when they beat Wanderers 1‚Äì0 in 2001 final of the same cup, to make matters worse it was Wanderers' old boy Mc Donald Yobe who scored the only goal against his former employers. The infamous 2003 final, probably the most anticipated, the two teams clashed in final of the same competition, Wanderers took an early lead in the first half when their wonderkid Joseph Kamwendo scored, he was only 17 at the time. Bullets equalized through their veteran striker Ganizani M'bobo Malunga. Wanderers scored two more goals but were disallowed for offside. This caused the fans to clash in the terraces, the match was abandoned and has never been replayed. Due to crowd troubles Carlsberg ended their sponsorship and other companies have also terminated contracts most notably Bp Top 8, Malawis biggest football competition in terms of prize money to date. The pair clashed again in the semi final of this trophy, wanderers won 3‚Äì1 to reach the finals. This time it was Bullets fans against the riot police in the stands and went on to the streets of Blantyre. Wanderers went on to win the trophy after beating northern regions biggest club Moyale Barracks FC 1‚Äì0 in Lilongwe. In 2014, the club won a sponsorship of about 70 million Malawi Kwacha from BE FORWARD, a Japanese Car Exporter. Due to sponsorship reasons, the team was previously known as Limbe Leaf Wanderers, Telecom Wanderers, MTL Wanderers and currently BE FORWARD Wanderers.

Hierarchical modulation is particularly used to mitigate the cliff effect in digital television broadcast, particularly mobile TV, by providing a (lower quality) fallback signal in case of weak signals, allowing graceful degradation instead of complete signal loss. It has been widely proven and included in various standards, such as DVB-T, MediaFLO, UMB (Ultra Mobile Broadband, a new 3.5th generation mobile network standard developed by 3GPP2), and is under study for DVB-H. Hierarchical modulation is also taken as one of the practical implementations of superposition precoding, which can help achieve the maximum sum rate of broadcast channels. When hierarchical-modulated signals are transmitted, users with good reception and advanced receivers can demodulate multiple layers. For a user with a conventional receiver or poor reception, it may only demodulate the data stream embedded in the base layer. With hierarchical modulation, a network operator can target users of different types with different services or QoS. However, traditional hierarchical modulation suffers from serious inter-layer interference (ILI) with impact on the achievable symbol rate. Example Layered Modulation Constellation For example, the figure depicts a layering scheme with QPSK base layer, and a 64QAM enhancement layer. The first layer is 2 bits (represented by the green circles). The signal detector only needs to establish which quadrant the signal is in, to recover the value (which is '10', the green circle in the lower right corner). In better signal conditions, the detector can establish the phase and amplitude more precisely, to recover four more bits of data ('1101'). Thus, the base layer carries '10', and the enhancement layer carries '1101'. Inter-layer interference For a hierarchically-modulated symbol with QPSK base layer and 16QAM enhancement layer, the base-layer throughput loss is up to about 1.5bits/symbol with the total receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at about 23 dB, about the minimum needed for the comparable non- hierarchical modulation, 64QAM. But unlayered 16QAM with the same SNR would approach full throughput. This means, due to ILI, about 1.5/4 = 37.5% loss of the base-layer achievable throughput. Furthermore, due to ILI and the imperfect demodulation of base-layer symbols, the demodulation error rate of higher-layer symbols increases too.

It contains elements of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz. As both neo-bop and post-bop categories denote eclectic mixtures of styles from the bebop and post-bebop eras, the standards for separating the two categories are not clear. In the United States neo-bop is associated with Wynton Marsalis and \\"The Young Lions,\\" although they have also been referred to as post-bop. Neo-bop was also embraced by established musicians who either ignored the avant-garde and fusion movements, or returned to music based on more traditional styles after experimenting with them. The return to more traditionally-based styles earned praise and also criticism. Miles Davis called it \\"warmed over turkey\\"The Guardian and others deemed it to be too dependent on the past. The movement, however, received praise from Time magazine and others who welcomed the return of more accessible forms of jazz.University of Dayton There were also those who deemed it a valid evolution from hard bop. Influences Some bebop and post-bop musicians eschewed both the avant-garde explorations of the 1960s and the electronically-based, pop-influenced sounds of jazz fusion to work within more traditional jazz forms. Most prominent among these was the drummer Art Blakey, whose Jazz Messengers group was a stylistic incubator for like-minded younger musicians. Drummer Cindy Blackman credited Blakey with keeping jazz from being completely eclipsed by fusion during the 1970s. Many of the younger musicians who went on to form the core of the neotraditionalist \\"Young Lions,\\" including Wynton Marsalis, were Jazz Messengers alumni. Dexter Gordon returned from an extended stay in Europe, where he had continued to play styles mostly ranging from bebop to hard bop, to New York in 1976. His \\"homecoming\\" generated a great deal of enthusiasm, reviving interest in musical forms that he and others had kept alive in Europe while they had fallen out of prominence in North America. Gordon would release a series of live and studio recordings through the late 1970s and the Savoy and Blue Note labels re-released recordings from their Gordon catalogs. Albert Murray, in his 1976 book Stomping the Blues, contended that true jazz was based on three elements, swing, blues tonalities, and acoustic sounds. His ideas influenced Stanley Crouch who, along with Marsalis, became a militant advocate of the core jazz elements as defined by Murray. Crouch went on to contend that many of the devices of avant-garde and fusion were grandstanding and used as a cover for lazy-mindedness or lack of musicianship. Crouch wrote, \\"We should laugh at those who make artistic claims for fusion.\\" In 1987 Murray, Crouch, and Marsalis founded the Jazz at Lincoln Center program in New York, where Crouch and Marsalis would serve as Artistic Directors. JALC would become one of the main institutional promoters of the neotraditionalist movement.

A student of Christopher Hill, his best known work was The English People and the English Revolution. Biography Manning's father was sports writer Lionel Manning and his half-brother was Daily Mail sports columnist and one- time Conservative candidate J. L. Manning. Manning was the uncle of Doctor Who actor Katy Manning. Manning himself went to Lancing College, winning the Brackenbury Scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. He was appointed to a lectureship at Manchester in 1959, and, in 1980, became professor at the University of Ulster, becoming emeritus upon his retirement in 1992. From its foundation until his move to Manchester, Manning served on the editorial board of the journal Past & Present, which had been set up in 1952, largely by the Communist Party Historians Group, to elaborate \\"history from below\\" ‚Äì the past as the story of generations of workers and peasants, women and men, struggling to make themselves and their world.Obituary in The Guardian. Manning's work drew largely on the Thomason collection of pamphlets held in the British Library and on Royalist propaganda about the social origins of their opponents in the English Civil War. Many of the themes that appeared in his work in the 1950s continued to dominate his publications even though the focus of historians' work had moved elsewhere. The rise of 'revisionist' historiography in the 1970s with its dismissal of Marxist approaches was a development he deplored, but which he was unable to overturn. His own work, as a result, became increasingly out of tune with the dominant themes of historical research from the mid-1970s onwards. Manning nevertheless remained prominent as a vigorous Marxist polemicist and political activist until the end of his life. In a group dominated by Hill and his fellow Communists, Manning was an odd man out, eschewing the CP and embracing instead the emerging New Left. After moving to Ireland he joined the Irish Socialist Workers Party.Obituary in Socialist Worker.

He was born in the town of Salamiyah of Hama Governorate in Syria to an Isma'ili family. Muhammad Maghout was credited as the father of the Arabic free verse poetry, liberating the Arabic poems from the traditional form and revolutionizing the structure of the poem. He penned his first poems on cigarette papers while in prison in the 1950s, he wrote it as his personal memoir of the prison experience later to be discovered as revolutionary poetry. Without formal education, he tapped into his vivid imagination, innate mastery of words and intuition in his future work. He wrote for theater, TV and cinema. Maghout's work combined satire with descriptions of social misery and malaise, and what he viewed as an ethical decline among rulers in the region. Some of his themes included the problems of injustice and totalitarian governments. The struggles of the marginalized was at the heart of all his work. His first theatrical production \\" The Hunchback bird\\" was originally a long poem that he wrote while in hiding in a small low ceiling room. A dialogue emerged within the poem transforming it to his first theatrical production. This was followed by another play \\"The Clown\\" played by the renowned lebanese actor Antoin Kerbaj.

Local forces, including police, qualified for many of the clasps, as could units of the Indian Army prior to 1947. The GSM was equivalent to the 1915 Naval General Service Medal. Both these medals were replaced by the General Service Medal in 1962.  Description  The 1918 GSM is a circular silver medal, in diameter, with following design: * The obverse shows the crowned effigy of the reigning monarch with an appropriate inscription. * The reverse bears the standing winged figure of Victory in a Corinthian helmet and carrying a trident, bestowing a wreath on the emblems of the Army (the sword) and the RAF (the wings). It was designed by E Carter Preston. * The wide ribbon has three equal stripes of purple, dark green and purple. * The service number, rank, name and regiment or corps of the recipient are impressed on the rim of the medal in small block capitals. A bronze oak leaf emblem is worn on the ribbon of the medal to signify a mention in dispatches or King's/Queen‚Äôs Commendation for a campaign for which the GSM was awarded.  Clasps  A total of eighteen clasps were awarded, the medal never being awarded without a clasp. The clasps consist of silver bars bearing the name of the relevant campaign or theatre of operations. They were attached to the medal's suspension bar. Where a minimum qualifying period was laid down for a clasp, it did not apply to those killed or wounded due to operations, or to those decorated for bravery or distinguished conduct, including a mention in dispatches and a Queen‚Äôs Commendation. The clasps and the award criteria for each are: * S. Persia :* Service at or near Bushire with Major-General J.A. Douglas and Brigadier-General A. M. S.

This was opposed by the Jewish settlers in Palestine, and in 1944 a guerrilla war was launched against the British forces there, principally by the Irgun and Lehi. While service in this conflict prior to May 1945 is counted as World War Two service, service between 27 September 1945 (the date a \\"state of emergency\\" was declared) and 30 June 1948 (when the last British troops departed) is acknowledged by this clasp to the GSM. * Berlin Airlift :As a result of the 2012 Independent Medal Review conducted by Sir John Holmes, from 1 March 2015 a Berlin Airlift clasp has been awarded to RAF or civilian aircrew with at least one day's service in the Berlin Airlift operation from 25 June 1948 to 6 October 1949 inclusive. * Malaya :For service in Malaya and Singapore against communist guerrilla forces. :The qualifying dates for service were between 16 June 1948 and 31 July 1960.

As a result of the 2012 Independent Medal Review conducted by Sir John Holmes, from 1 October 2014 the qualifying period was reduced to 90 days service, to bring it into line with the Africa General Service Medal awarded for the Kenya campaign. * Near East :This clasp was awarded for service in Egypt during the period 31 October to 22 December 1956. This conflict is often referred to as the Suez Crisis, or by its codename of Operation Musketeer. * Arabian Peninsula :Due to a disagreement about land and associated oil rights, the Iman of Oman rebelled against the Sultan of Muscat.

It is sometimes considered to be conspecific with the long-eared owl (Asio otus). Description The Madagascan owl is similar in appearance to the Holarctic long-eared owl in that it sits tall and at rest shows prominent ear tufts. The plumage is mainly brown with darker streaks and bars. It has distinctive bright orange eyes. The adults are brown above, and mottled with buff, especially across the mantle. The face is plain dark buff, with darker brown feathers around the eyes, on the edge of the facial disc, and on the ear tufts. The underparts are light brown with darker brown streaks which fade away towards the vent. The juvenile is covered in white down contrasting with a black facial disk and dark brown wings. It ranges from in length, making it the largest of the country's owls; females are larger than males. Its call is usually a series of barks, varying in pitch and volume, but sometimes it will utter a series of more hoot-like notes, described by some as ulooh. Distribution and habitat The Madagascan owl is endemic to Madagascar, where it is widespread in the west and centre of the island. It is generally found at elevations ranging from sea level to , though it occasionally ranges as high as . It inhabits a variety of woodland habitats, mainly in the drier western forests, although it appears quite adaptable, and also occurs in degraded habitats, even on the central plateau where the forest cover has been fragmented. Habits Like most owls, the Madagascan owl is nocturnal, roosting by day in dense foliage. It feeds mainly on small mammals, hunting either in the forest or in open areas nearby. Pellets collected from a roost site in south eastern Madagascar were examined and contained the remains of insects; frogs (Boophis); geckoes (Uroplatus), birds (broad-billed roller and Malagasy bulbul); rodents, including tufted-tailed rats (Eliurus spp.);and black rat Rattus rattus); Commerson's leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros commersoni); and mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.). Little is known about its breeding biology. It is thought to lay its eggs in stick nests created by other animals, like the closely related long-eared owl.

In 1967 eligibility was widened to include those who served in a supporting role in Aden.British Battles and Medals, p 262. =South Arabia= :This campaign is related to the Radfan Campaign, because both were Egyptian-inspired attempts to end the British presence in Aden and end the embryonic Federation of South Arabia. This 3-year long campaign saw numerous terrorist attacks on both civilian and military targets. In both Rafan and Aden, the British Army suffered 90 personnel killed and 510 wounded. :The qualifying period was 30 days service in the Federation of South Arabia between 1 August 1964 and 30 November 1967. =Malay Peninsula= :This campaign was an extension of the conflict in Borneo where British and Malaysian troops were operating against Indonesian insurgents.

Between 1963 and 1965, at least 68 members of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) and 232 members of the RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam qualified for the clasp. However, a decision in 1966 relating to the institution and award of the Vietnam Medal led to the stripping of the award from the RAAF personnel. A Royal Warrant dated 8 June 1968Royal Warrant, Australian Dept of Defence website retrospectively changed the qualifying periods to: :Between 24 December 1962 and 29 May 1964: :* 30 days' service in ships operating in inland waters or off the Vietnamese coast. :* 1 day in the service of a land unit. :* 1 operational sortie. :* 30 days' service on an official visit. :For service after 29 May 1964, personnel were awarded the Vietnam Medal.

The revolt worsened in 1967 when the British left the adjacent State of Aden, with the new communist government in Yemen providing an important base for the rebels. With the Sultan clearly losing the war, his son staged a coup on 23 July 1970, after which he expanded the armed forces with British assistance. :The British Special Air Service (SAS) ostensibly provided training for local forces (BATT), but in reality was an operational fighting unit, the Royal Artillery installed mortar locating radars and a sound ranging base at Salalah, the Royal Engineers provided military and civil engineering, and RAF officers provided the backbone of the new Sultan's air force. The RAF Regiment, as well as airfield ground staff and the Royal Signals, were a continuous presence at the air base in Salalah from 1970 to 1976. In addition, many British officers were seconded to the Sultan's Armed Forces (SAF). Jordan and Iran also provided assistance. :During this period, the British forces suffered 24 killed and 55 wounded. :The qualifying period for the clasp was 30 days service between 1 October 1969 and 30 September 1976. =Lebanon= :In June 1982, in an attempt to remove PLO bases which were attacking Israel, Israel invaded Lebanon and advanced towards Lebanon's capital Beirut.

In a normal coordinate system, the Christoffel symbols of the connection vanish at the point p, thus often simplifying local calculations. In normal coordinates associated to the Levi-Civita connection of a Riemannian manifold, one can additionally arrange that the metric tensor is the Kronecker delta at the point p, and that the first partial derivatives of the metric at p vanish. A basic result of differential geometry states that normal coordinates at a point always exist on a manifold with a symmetric affine connection. In such coordinates the covariant derivative reduces to a partial derivative (at p only), and the geodesics through p are locally linear functions of t (the affine parameter). This idea was implemented in a fundamental way by Albert Einstein in the general theory of relativity: the equivalence principle uses normal coordinates via inertial frames. Normal coordinates always exist for the Levi-Civita connection of a Riemannian or Pseudo-Riemannian manifold. By contrast, in general there is no way to define normal coordinates for Finsler manifolds in a way that the exponential map are twice-differentiable . Geodesic normal coordinates Geodesic normal coordinates are local coordinates on a manifold with an affine connection defined by means of the exponential map \\\\exp_p : T_{p}M \\\\supset V \\\\rightarrow M and an isomorphism E: \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\rightarrow T_{p}M given by any basis of the tangent space at the fixed basepoint p ‚àà M. If the additional structure of a Riemannian metric is imposed, then the basis defined by E may be required in addition to be orthonormal, and the resulting coordinate system is then known as a Riemannian normal coordinate system. Normal coordinates exist on a normal neighborhood of a point p in M. A normal neighborhood U is a subset of M such that there is a proper neighborhood V of the origin in the tangent space TpM, and expp acts as a diffeomorphism between U and V. On the normal neighborhood U of p in M, the chart is given by: \\\\varphi := E^{-1} \\\\circ \\\\exp_p^{-1}: U \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^n The isomorphism E can be any isomorphism between the two vector spaces, so there are as many charts as there are different orthonormal bases in the domain of E. = Properties = The properties of normal coordinates often simplify computations. In the following, assume that U is a normal neighborhood centered at a point p in M and x^i are normal coordinates on U. * Let V be some vector from T_p M with components V^i in local coordinates, and \\\\gamma_V be the geodesic at t=0 pass through the point p with velocity vector V, then \\\\gamma_V is represented in normal coordinates by \\\\gamma_V(t) = (tV^1, ... , tV^n) as long as it is in U. * The coordinates of a point p are (0, ..., 0) * In Riemannian normal coordinates at a point p the components of the Riemannian metric g_{ij} simplify to \\\\delta_{ij} , i.e., g_{ij}(p)=\\\\delta_{ij}. * The Christoffel symbols vanish at p, i.e., \\\\Gamma_{ij}^k(p)=0 . In the Riemannian case, so do the first partial derivatives of g_{ij} , i.e., \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{ij}}{\\\\partial x^k}(p)=0,\\\\,\\\\forall i,j,k. = Explicit formulae = In the neighbourhood of any point p=(0,\\\\ldots 0) equipped with a locally orthonormal coordinate system in which g_{\\\\mu u}(0)= \\\\delta_{\\\\mu u} and the Riemann tensor at p takes the value R_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma u\\\\tau}(0) we can adjust the coordinates x^\\\\mu so that the components of the metric tensor away from p become g_{\\\\mu u}(x)= \\\\delta_{\\\\mu u}- \\\\frac 13 R_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma u\\\\tau}(0) x^\\\\sigma x^\\\\tau + O(x^3). The corresponding Levi-Civita connection Christoffel symbols are {\\\\Gamma^{\\\\lambda}}_{\\\\mu u}(x)= -\\\\frac 13 (R_{\\\\lambda u\\\\mu\\\\tau}(0)+R_{\\\\lambda\\\\mu u\\\\tau}(0))x^\\\\tau+ O(x^2). Similarly we can construct local coframes in which e^{*a}_\\\\mu(x)= \\\\delta_{a \\\\mu}- \\\\frac 16 R_{a \\\\sigma \\\\mu\\\\tau}(0) x^\\\\sigma x^\\\\tau +O(x^2), and the spin- connection coefficients take the values {\\\\omega^a}_{b\\\\mu}(x)=- \\\\frac 12 {R^a}_{b\\\\mu\\\\tau}(0)x^\\\\tau+O(x^2). Polar coordinates On a Riemannian manifold, a normal coordinate system at p facilitates the introduction of a system of spherical coordinates, known as polar coordinates. These are the coordinates on M obtained by introducing the standard spherical coordinate system on the Euclidean space TpM. That is, one introduces on TpM the standard spherical coordinate system (r,œÜ) where r ‚â• 0 is the radial parameter and œÜ = (œÜ1,...,œÜn‚àí1) is a parameterization of the (n‚àí1)-sphere. Composition of (r,œÜ) with the inverse of the exponential map at p is a polar coordinate system. Polar coordinates provide a number of fundamental tools in Riemannian geometry. The radial coordinate is the most significant: geometrically it represents the geodesic distance to p of nearby points. Gauss's lemma asserts that the gradient of r is simply the partial derivative \\\\partial/\\\\partial r. That is, :\\\\langle df, dr\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial r} for any smooth function ∆í. As a result, the metric in polar coordinates assumes a block diagonal form :g = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1&0&\\\\cdots\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&&\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots &&g;_{\\\\phi\\\\phi}(r,\\\\phi)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&& \\\\end{bmatrix}.

The √ñtztaler Ache river flows through the valley in a northern direction. The √ñtztal separates the Stubai Alps in the east from the √ñtztal Alps in the west. The valley is long. The northern end of the valley is at the confluence of the √ñtztaler Ache and Inn rivers, 8 km east of Imst and 50 km west of Innsbruck. The only railway station of the valley, √ñtztal railway station, is located here and connects the √ñtztal with the Arlberg railway (Innsbruck-Bludenz) and also a motorway interchange to the A12 (E60). The southern end of the valley, also called the Gurglertal, terminates at the border with Italy. The valley is formed by the main chain of the Alps, with many glaciers and high peaks, including the Wei√ükugel and the Similaun. The village of Obergurgl at the southern end of the √ñtztal is the highest parish in Austria. The √ñtztal consists of five municipalities (from north to south): Sautens, Oetz, Umhausen, L√§ngenfeld, and S√∂lden. The main industry in the valley is tourism. The mountains around the valley are popular with both mountaineers and skiers. There are ski resorts in the upper part of the valley at S√∂lden, Hochs√∂lden, and Hochgurgl. The Timmelsjoch mountain pass connects the √ñtztal with the Passeier Valley and Merano in the province of South Tyrol, Italy. The √ñtztal Glacier Road is the highest paved road in the Alps. It is the access road from S√∂lden to the Rettenbach glacier and the Tiefenbachferner glacier. The highest point of the glacier road is at southern end of the ski tunnel (). History Berghof (about 1920) Umhausen (about 1920) The oldest tool finds in the region, evidence of human settlement are approximately thousands of years old. Most famous example is a well-preserved natural mummy of a man who lived around 3,300 BCE with the nickname √ñtzi; he is also called the Iceman, the Similaun Man, the Man from Hauslabjoch, the Tyrolean Iceman, Homo tyrolensis, and the Hauslabjoch mummy. √ñtzi was found in 1991 in the nearby Schnalstal glacier near the Fineilspitze and the Similaun. The √ñtzi monument is located about an hour's walk from the Similaun Hut. Umhausen is the oldest village in the √ñtztal area. S√∂lden as we know it today grew out of 20 buildings in the 13th century AD. One of these buildings, which still exists today, is the Berghof. A building on the site of the Berghof was first mentioned in 1370. In 1588, the Berghof was mentioned in the records of St. Petersberg Castle as one of the original farmsteads. Hedwig von Trapp / The Sound of Music Hedwig von Trapp, member of the Trapp family, lived and worked after the dissolution of the family choir in Farst, above Umhausen. This workplace, located at 1470 meter above sea level was designed to alleviate the asthma-related Hedwig von Trapp. Hedwig von Trapp was known from the film and musical The Sound of Music, in this film the experiences of the Trapp family have been filmed. Hedwig von Trapp was portrayed by the character \\"Brigitta\\" in the film. The school, Hedwig von Trapp worked, is still in its original condition.

Webkinz were originally released by the Canadian toy company Ganz on April 29, 2005. The toys are enjoyed by a wide variety of age groups and are similar to many other small plush toys; however, each Webkinz toy has an attached tag with a unique \\"Secret Code\\" printed on it that allows its owner to play with their pet in the \\"Webkinz World\\" website. On Webkinz World, the Secret Code allows the user to own a virtual version of the pet for online play. Lil' Kinz are smaller, less expensive versions of Webkinz, while the Signature collection is larger, higher-quality, and slightly more expensive. Sales of plush Webkinz toys are limited to the United States and Canada, but international users can buy virtual pets from the online eStore.Webkinz eStore In 2006, Webkinz had one million online accounts, and according to one estimate published in Wired they made $100 million in 2006. In 2011, Webkinz made its first commercial on TV. Webkinz was updated in 2015 to Webkinz X, making it more kid-friendly.  Types of Webkinz There are many types of Webkinz: regular pets, wild animals, mythical creatures, and made-up ones. They all come with codes that can be entered on the computer at www.webkinz.com Along with the regular Webkinz toys, there are also smaller, less expensive versions called Lil' Kinz as well as larger, slightly more expensive versions in the Signature collection launched in April 2009. The Signature collection later ended in December 2013. In May 2009, Birthstone Pets were released. One new Birthstone Pet was released for every month. In April 2010, Ganz replaced the Birthstone Pets with the Zodiac Pets. Again, one Zodiac Pet will be released every month. In 2011, CandyKinz were released. In June 2012, Rockerz Pets were released. In 2019, Ganz announced that no new plush pets would be released as of now, but purely virtual pets can still be purchased, accounts can be made, and the website still operates.  Gameplay  Each Webkinz stuffed animal and Webkinz accessory comes with an 8-character code. By registering this code at www.webkinz.com, the customer \\"adopts\\" this pet in the virtual Webkinz World. Without the code, the user will not get access to the full Webkinz World, but they can create a free account. On January 19, 2011, Ganz announced that Webkinz World accounts would no longer expire, meaning users would not have to buy a new pet each year to renew their account. However, some games, furniture, and other features are limited with a free account. Young adults who had active accounts on the website, have even revisited their pets to catch up on their health as an online trend.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBgF8l08SR4 The Webkinz World is an online play area with its own economy completely controlled by Ganz. The user receives money (called KinzCash) by adopting new pets, playing online games, answering general knowledge questions, and through daily activities like clicking \\"I love my Webkinz!\\", spinning the Wheel of WOW, playing Wishing Well 2, or completing jobs (minigames) available once every 8 hours. Each day, there is a Game of the Day which can be played for bonus KinzCash, and other bonuses are available each hour, full days on weekends and afternoons only on weekdays. With each Webkinz toy purchased, more KinzCash, rooms, and items are added to the user's account. The online world also contains many rare or exclusive items. Some of these items require developing a friendship with the Curio Shop owner to purchase, while others are obtained by registering other Webkinz accessories purchased in the real world. Each type of pet gets a special item and food available exclusively for them. Also, a Pet of the Month is announced at the beginning of each month. If a person registers the announced pet in that month, they will receive other exclusive items. Many of the tasks in Webkinz World involve collecting items. For example, recipes are released for the players through cookbooks or one of the TV shows called The Secret Chef. \\"Gems\\" can be mined once a day at the Curio Shop, with a full set of gems being turned into the Webkinz Crown of Wonder and buy exclusive items. A similar feature called Alyssa's Star Challenge, involves users clicking on colored stars to find valuable stars. Other features of Webkinz include: * The ability to create shows with the Webkinz Studio, and enter to be chosen to appear on the Webkinz TV. * Buying a swimming pool, a trampoline, and a treadmill where Webkinz can improve their health. * Sending gifts or letters to friends on a peer-to-peer network. * Inviting a friend over to one's house, where users can chat and interact with each other and play games. * Participating in the hourly events, which can earn the user prizes, KinzCash, and coupons, among other things. * Brushing, washing, and bathing one's pet. * Setting up a party, inviting guests, playing games and giving out loot bags. (a Party Pack costs 750 to 1000 KinzCash) * Playing a variety of games such as gem mining. * Trading items with other players. * Reading virtual books exclusive to the Webkinz World. * Enrolling one's virtual pet in school, or \\"The Kinzville Academy\\" where they can learn and develop skills to help them compete in tournaments. * Decorating pets' home. Furniture can be purchased via the W-shop in the Webkinz World. * Interacting with other players via the Webkinz Clubhouse, where players can play games such as \\"Link'd\\" (Connect four), Checkers, and much more. * Shopping for clothes with one's pet. = Webkinz Studio = * The Webkinz Studio generally costs 1000 KinzCash in the W Shop. * There are currently 18 characters and 9 sets. One can buy more from the W Shop. * In 2008, a very strict dictionary was added to secure the words used in the studio. * In March 2010, Webkinz announced that the Studio had been \\"enhanced\\" with more features, including \\"slide transitions\\", the \\"who speaks first\\" option, and character entrances and exits. * Also, the Studio can be found in the Curio Shop on a rare basis for less than 1000 KinzCash.  Membership  When a pet is registered at www.webkinz.com (or \\"adopted\\"), it gives or renews an account's full membership features for one year. When the membership of a pet expires, the account becomes a free account, missing the ability to play some games, buy certain items, and do other things in the world. However, a player can renew their account again whenever. There is also an upgrade to regular memberships called the Deluxe Membership which is available at the Ganz eStore. This is a premium membership with many features, benefits, games, and prizes to which regular accounts do not have access. Deluxe Members also receive free Webkinz eStore points at the time of purchase and at the beginning of each month afterward for the extent of the Deluxe Membership. If one wants to register an account at www.webkinz.com without a pet code, they are permitted to select from 9 Ganz eStore Pets. Several limitations exist on free accounts that make many challenges and activities impossible. Free accounts can be upgraded to regular memberships or Deluxe Memberships at any time.http://webkinznewz.ganzworld.com/announcements/help/  W-Plus & Trading Cards  Aside from the Webkinz, Lil' Kinz, Signature, and Rockerz Pets, Ganz also has made other toys that can be used on Webkinz World. These are called W-Plus items, and all W-Plus items come with a secret code that can be used in the Code Shop in Webkinz World. These codes unlock items for the Webkinz Pets, like new room themes, clothing for pets, KinzCash, and other prizes. = W-Plus = These are all of the W-Plus items Ganz has released:Webkinz Collection Catalog * Body spray and lip gloss‚Äîunlocks a piece of furniture for the Glam Boutique theme * Clothing for the Webkinz stuffed toys‚Äîunlocks the KinzStyle bag, which can be used to access the KinzStyle Shop.

The cards come in booster packs, with 5 playing cards and a code card in each pack. In these packs, there are also chances of getting special cards as well, like free pet codes. In Series 1, players can also get Curio Shop Curiosities and Webkinz Doodlez.Webkinz - Webkinz Trading Cards In Series 2, there is At Paw Level and W-Tales Snapshots instead. These special cards are foil. For Series 1, 80 base cards have been released, 12 challenges, 8 Curio Shop Curiosities, and 8 Webkinz Doodlez. In Series 2, there are 85 base cards, 15 challenges, 8 At Paw Levels and 8 W-Tales Snapshots.Webkinz - Trading Cards Series II Available Now! Read all about it! The cards are also W-Plus items, and they each come with 2-5 codes. 1 code on each card is for a virtual pack of Trading Cards, while the other 1-4 can unlock prizes like rare and exclusive themes or coupons. Series 3 changed the format, with only 1 feature code per pack, and no code for a virtual pack. The packs also included stickers and a chance to win a previously unheard-of Pet, the Magical Retriever. Also, Ganz has said that each Series 3 code gives users an item they cannot find anywhere else in Webkinz World. Series 4 has also been released, and the prize Pet, the Mystical Panda, replaces the Magical Retriever.  Ganz eStore  The Ganz eStore is targeted to an older audience of the website, it can be used to purchase virtual pets, furniture and items with real currency. Sales of plush Webkinz and Lil' Kinz are limited to the United States and Canada, however, virtual pets can be purchased from the Ganz eStore by international residents. Secret Codes issued in conjunction with virtual pets can be used the same way as Secret Codes attached to plush pets. Deluxe Members get free Ganz eStore points every month.  Webkinz games  Webkinz World has many games in which players can play to earn KinzCash. The website also has a wide range of multiplayer games for users to play against their friends and anyone else who wants to play at the time. There are some games specifically reserved for a premium tier of users, called Deluxe Membership.  Criticism  Concerns have been raised about children's use and overuse of the toys. Parents may worry that children will become addicted to the game. Some parents have voiced concerns about the website's online chat system. The KinzChat chat system has various safety precautions, with restrictions on who can send messages. Additionally, users cannot type, but can choose phrases to say from a list. Concerns have also been raised about the toys being a distraction in school, occasionally resulting in them being banned from school grounds. Concerns were also raised when the once advertisement-free site started displaying advertisements, previously only for their own additional game-related products, but now also for movies, such as Alvin and the Chipmunks and Bee Movie.CCFC News - Webkinz takes heat for taking advertising There is an option that members can use to block ads that promote sites not sponsored by or affiliated with Webkinz or Ganz. However, if enabled, this option can not be changed until 30 days have passed. Rumors have circulated that malware is present.Davis, Lisa (28 September 2007). \\"Interactive Toys Like Webkinz Are Drawing Young Kids, Worrying Some Parents.\\" Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Ed.)\\". Tanager Books Description The Abyssinian owl has yellow eyes, a black bill and gray eyebrows. It is similar in appearance to the long-eared owl, Asio otus, but their ranges do not overlap, and the Abyssinian owl is darker. It has prominent dark brown, white- edged ear tufts that are slightly centrally located on the head.del Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; Sargatal, J. 1999. Handbook of the Birds of the World, vol. 5: Barn-owls to Hummingbirds. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona, Spain Behavior and Reproduction Asio abyssinicus is a nocturnal owl. It uses the nests of other birds to raise its offspring. The claws of the Abyssinian owl are significantly stronger than other members of the genus; as a result a wider range of prey is available, including smaller birds, field mice, and shrews. Distribution The Abyssinian owl prefers open grasslands or moorlands with oak or cedar forests, and it is found in mountain valleys and gorges at elevations of up to 3900 meters (12,800 ft.) above sea level. It lives in the Albertine Rift montane forests, Ethiopia and northern Kenya. This species is classified as least concern by IUCN due to its very large range. However, the species is described as \\"rare to scarce\\" when looking to identify one.

The band was considered one of the most prominent and creative groups to emerge from Minneapolis in the 1990s. Billboard writer Deborah Russell called Ackerson and Polara the front of \\"the emergence of a new local (Twin Cities) scene\\" more interested in pop music and postpunk than the punk rock of bands like H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements. Formation Ackerson's previous band, the 27 Various, blended 1960s mod-rock influences with Syd Barrett-style psychedelia, and released five albums between 1987 and 1992‚Äîthe first two limited releases on Ackerson's own Susstones label, and the others on the larger label Clean (Twin/Tone). Despite an increasingly visible profile and critical praise over the course of its career, the band's prospects suffered when Twin/Tone's distributor, Rough Trade, went out of business. Nevertheless, Ackerson was seen as a rising star. Trouser Press writer Ira Robbins, in an overview of Ackerson's career, called the Various' album Approximately a turning point \\"for Ackerson, who was on his way to becoming an assured and able multi-faceted rocker,\\" and noted that the heavier sound Ackerson would pursue in Polara was starting to be apparent on the 27 Various' final album, 1992's Fine. After a short stint as second guitarist in Blake Babies singer John Strohm's band Antenna, Ackerson formed Polara in 1994 with guitarist Jennifer Jurgens, bassist Jason Orris, and Trip Shakespeare's Matt Wilson on drums, continuing his interest in 1960s psychedelic pop but adding a heavy element of Krautrock-inspired electronics and keyboards. Career First Avenue Polara was Ackerson's first band to gain significant national attention. The group released a self-titled debut in 1995, which Allmusic writer Rick Anderson called \\"weird but lovable\\" and \\"as fresh and bracing as a bucket of ice water in the face.\\" Billboard writer Chris Morris called it \\"the first truly great album (I have) heard in 1995.\\" Strohm also contributed to the debut album. Critical acclaim for Polara led to a bidding war by several major labels; Polara eventually signed to Interscope for its second album, C'est La Vie, in 1997, with Peter Anderson replacing Wilson on drums. Though Ackerson produced most of C'est La Vie himself, the band also worked with prominent producers Alan Moulder (Smashing Pumpkins), Sean Slade, and Paul Q. Kolderie on several tracks. Ackerson took a holistic approach to making music, viewing composition, performance, recording and post-production all as steps in a single process of creating a song. He told an interviewer in Guitar Player magazine, \\"It's all part of the same thing‚Äîamps, guitars, effects. You're playing it all.\\" Ackerson believed that constant experimentation with new sounds was at the heart of his songwriting approach with Polara, which he stated \\"would never make the same record twice.\\" In contrast to Polara, his intention on C'est la Vie was to play more straightforward rock. \\"The first album had no lead (guitar parts), and that was very deliberate. I was kind of politicized about it. But when we started to get this record together I realized that I am a rock guitar player, and we felt like making a record more related to rock.\\" A third album, Formless/Functional, followed in 1998. Despite a generally warm reception by critics (Trouser Press' Ira Robbins called it \\"stylish and sophisticated\\"), the album received little support from its record label. Corporate mergers involving Interscope soon led the label to drop many bands, including Polara. Ackerson put Polara on hold in favor of other projects, but Jurgens and new bassist Dan Boen rejoined Ackerson for 2002's Jetpack Blues, released on Susstones. Greg Winter of CMJ called Jetpack Blues \\"exquisite,\\" with \\"short but sweet guitar solos and beautiful vocal harmonies.\\" A final album, Beekeeping, came out in 2008. Polara has been honored with a star on the outside mural of famed Twin Cities club First Avenue. Ackerson himself was a sound engineer at the club in the 1990s. The stars recognize performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \\"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\\" according to journalist Steve Marsh. Polara composed an original score for the silent film The Fall of the House of Usher , which they performed live at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre as part of the 2002 Los Angeles Film Festival. Polara's song \\"Scorched Youth Policy\\" appears on the soundtrack to the 1996 Jackie Chan film Supercop. After Polara, Ackerson started a new group, BNLX (named after the abbreviation for Belgium-Netherlands-Luxembourg) with his wife Ashley Ackerson. He also released two solo albums, Ed Ackerson and Ackerson2, in 2007 and 2008, as well as a 2002 instrumental album, Oblivion And Points Beyond, under the name Sideways. Ackerson died on October 4, 2019, of pancreatic cancer. =Tribute album= On October 5, 2020, the first anniversary of Ackerson's death, the Susstones label released a 30-song tribute album via Bandcamp, Closer To Heaven: A Tribute To Ed Ackerson, featuring 30 bands reinterpreting Ackerson songs. Artists included The Jayhawks, Motion City Soundtrack, Tanya Donelly, Dandy Warhols, and The Ocean Blue. The title was taken from Polara's last single, which had been released as a digital-only track in 2009 and was nearly forgotten until its rediscovery during work on the tribute album; Susstones re-released it also on the same day as the tribute album's release. Profits from Closer To Heaven went to an education fund for Ackerson's daughter.

It saw the first playing of the University match and the introduction of roundarm bowling as an accepted way of delivering the ball. The controversy surrounding roundarm bowling came to a head before the season began and three trial matches were played between Sussex and All- England. No firm conclusions were drawn in the immediate aftermath of the trials and it was many years before roundarm was formally legalised, but in practice roundarm was adopted in 1827 as its practitioners, especially William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge of Sussex, continued to use it with little, if any, opposition from umpires. Underarm bowling did not cease and continued into the twentieth century with George Simpson-Hayward being the last major exponent. On 22 August, George Rawlins playing for Sheffield against NottinghamNottingham v Sheffield in 1827 became the first batsman to be out hit the ball twice in a first-class game.Wynne-Thomas, Peter; The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records; p. 93 This has since occurred only six more times in English first-class cricket, and not since 1906.

WCNS broadcasts with a daytime power output of 500 watts, and a nighttime power of 1,000 watts. The station broadcasts non-directionally during the daytime, and uses a four-tower directional antenna pattern at night. History =Beginnings as WTRA= Beginning in 1956, WTRA signed on four years after the debut of another Latrobe AM station, WKHJ, known then as WAKU. The station was owned by Latrobe Broadcasters, Inc., a company headed by Martin Barsky, and maintained studios and offices at 204 Main Street in downtown Latrobe. The station was later sold in 1966 to WTRA Broadcasting Corporation and relocated to the historic Miller Hotel on Ligonier Street, where it remained until the hotel was destroyed by a fire in 1974. WTRA general manager Albert Calisti would go on to start his own radio station, WBCW in Jeannette that same year. WCNS would then relocate to 317 Depot Street, where it would remain until the turn of the 21st Century. Three years after WTRA signed on, a substitute DJ by the name of John Longo was hired as an employee, and 30 years later, Longo would assume the ownership of this station. Though Longo would later leave what would later become WCNS to pursue advancement opportunities at other neighboring stations, he would later return in November 1983 as an equity partner, four years after the station was sold by WTRA Broadcasting to Advance Communications Corporation . With the ownership change came a new set of call letters...WCNS. The newly named station, now boasting a new country format, saw its most dramatic changes under Advance's ownership and Longo's leadership. =Night broadcast hours added= The station operated as a daytime-only radio station competing against WQTW for much of its existence, until it received permission in 1984 to broadcast with nighttime power. With this move, WCNS became one of only 15 affiliates in the United States at the time to affiliate with the Transtar Radio Network. The move was made to avoid a costly expense of hiring additional on-air personalities, putting the existing announcers to local news and sports duties, where their talents would be better utilized. The station then affiliated with Transtar's 'Country Coast to Coast' format. It was a bold move indeed, because stations utilizing satellite-delivered music formats were more music-intensive FM stations, and WCNS was one of the very few AM's that went the satellite route. A nearby AM station north of Latrobe, WCCS, (known then as WRID and licensed to Homer City in Indiana County) had achieved success less than a year before using the same concept. With the addition of nighttime power, WCNS also built a new transmitter facility adjacent to the Westmoreland County airport, increasing the amount of its towers from one to four. WCNS also had the advantage of being the only radio station in Latrobe on the air at around this time, as the studios and offices of WQTW had been consumed in a fire the year before, which left that station silent for approximately nine months. One by one, WCNS began to add regional sports franchises to further augment its position as a full-service station for Westmoreland County, though it was not licensed to the county seat of Greensburg. WCNS signed affiliate agreements for Pittsburgh Steelers football, University of Pittsburgh football and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball. =Sale to Longo Media Group= In January 1989, John Longo, having by this time established a solid reputation as a successful sales manager, programming and marketing consultant, and a general manager, bought out his fellow partners at Advance Communications and purchased the very station where he began his career 30 years ago under the name of his newly formed company, Longo Media Group. It was a family-owned business in every sense of the word. Longo managed the station and sold airtime, his wife Donna served as the station's business manager, and his adult children, John Paul and Lisa, also sold airtime. Recognizing the need for an adult contemporary music format to complement the full-service elements of WCNS, Longo Media Group switched affiliation agreements to Transtar's AC II format. Later that year, Longo acquired an FM station 13 miles north in Blairsville, known then as WNQQ, giving WCNS an FM sister station (though not co-located until years later) for the first time in its history. The new station was assigned the call letters WLCY-FM. In an unusual move that eventually paid off, WCNS agreed to affiliate with the Post-Gazette Radio Network, which started up during a 1992 strike that stopped the presses at both the Post-Gazette and its separately owned but co-managed affiliate, the Pittsburgh Press. After the strike had settled, the newspaper decided on short notice to cease the Post-Gazette Network's operations and sell its satellite-delivery network to the KBL Sports Network, the local cable TV network in Pittsburgh that carried Pittsburgh Penguin hockey. Because KBL had also acquired the radio rights to broadcast Penguin hockey, they offered the old PGN affiliates first right of refusal for carrying the broadcasts, many of which were not already carrying the games. Because WCNS and WLCY were both PGN affiliates, Longo Media Group agreed to carry the games on both stations. WCNS had exclusive radio game rights for Westmoreland County, and WLCY had the exclusive radio game rights for Indiana County...taking the game broadcasts from respective competitors WHJB (now WKHB) and WCCS. This locked up the third and final Pittsburgh pro sports franchise for WCNS in 1993. The next year, WCNS switched its format to oldies and took the moniker \\"Oldies 1480 WCNS\\". In 2006, following the lead of many oldies-formatted stations, WCNS chose to discard the \\"oldies\\" portion of the moniker and switched to \\"My Radio 1480\\", though the music format remained the same until early 2009, when it switched to adult standards. Despite a very successful run of 13 years that demonstrated long-term profitability for Longo Media Group, John Longo in 2002 decided to sell WLCY to Pittsburgh-based Renda Broadcasting Corporation, which had been looking to establish a foothold in the Indiana County market. Longo Media did retain possession of WCNS. =Sale to Laurel Highland Total Communications= In a story that ran in the February 7, 2014 issue of the Tribune-Review, John Longo announced on January 30 that he was planning to retire and move to Florida. After stating that he was seeking a local buyer for WCNS, he received multiple offers from prospective buyers immediately. On June 19, Longo Media Group entered into an agreement with Laurel Highland Total Communications, Inc. (dba LHTC Media, Inc.) of Stahlstown to sell WCNS at a price of $450,000. The FCC approved the sale on August 15, with both parties closing on Monday, September 2, 2014. WCNS today On February 15, 2016, WCNS switched to a news-talk format, using the slogan Westmoreland's News Talk 1480. Local news is reported hourly by Hank Baughman, Aaron Anderson and the SRN and Townhall News Networks owned by Salem Media Group. According to the station, Baughman is a \\"long-time Pittsburgh news anchor.\\" Dow Carnahan, who won two Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters awards in 2013 and 2014 for Best Local Newscast, was the station's main morning news and sports voice for 32 years, until his passing on Friday, April 29, 2016, at age 56. Quinn in the Morning, with veteran Pittsburgh radio personality Jim Quinn, continues to air Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 am and a new show, Talk Westmoreland, hosted by Baughman, airs Monday through Friday from 10 am to noon. From noon until 6 am Monday through Friday, WCNS airs six nationally syndicated talk shows: The Dennis Prager Show, The Savage Nation, The Mark Levin Show, The Hugh Hewitt Show, AAR's Daily Defense Hour, and Red Eye Radio, all of which are also streamed online at 1480wcns.com. The station also continues to cover local sports, including Greater Latrobe High School football, basketball and wrestling, St. Vincent College football and men's and women's basketball, and WCNS continues to be the local outlet for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Steelers. In late November 2017, WCNS dropped its news/talk format and began stunting with Christmas music, with a switch to an adult contemporary format after the holidays.WCNS Drops News/Talk; Prepping Post-Christmas Flip Radioinsight - December 7, 2017 Previous logo 175px (WCNS' logo under previous news/talk format) References * Pittsburgh Tribune-Review: Radio Days * Pittsburgh Tribune- Review: One Joke * 1957 Broadcasting Yearbook * 1967 Broadcasting Yearbook * 1981 Broadcasting Yearbook * Pittsburgh Tribune-Review: Latrobe Broadcasting Legend Dedicated to Craft, Community * The Latrobe Bulletin: Former Station Owner Shares Memories of Dow External links *WCNS Website CNS Category:Radio stations established in 1956 Category:1956 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Latrobe, Pennsylvania Category:Adult contemporary radio stations in the United States ","title":"WCNS"},{"id":"7680184","text":"Vane may refer to: People * Vane (surname) * Vane Featherston (1864‚Äì1948), English stage actress * Ivan Vane Ivanoviƒá (1913‚Äì1999), Yugoslav-British athlete, shipowner, political activist, and philanthropist * Vane Pennell (1876‚Äì1938), English rackets and real tennis player * Viscount Vane, an extinct title in the Peerage of Ireland Places * Van√´, a settlement in Albania * Vane, Avatime, a populated place in Ghana * VƒÅne Parish, Latvia * Vane Glacier, Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica Other uses * Vane (album), the only album by Bleak, released in 1995 * Parts besides the shaft in a pennaceous feather * A plastic fin on an arrow * D-alanine‚ÄîD-serine ligase, an enzyme (VanE) * Vane, singular form of Vanir, a group of gods in Norse mythology * Vane (video game), a video game released for the Playstation 4 See also * Vane display, a type of 7-segment display * Vane anemometer * Vain (disambiguation) * Cooper vane * Rotary vane pump * Weather vane ","title":"Vane"},{"id":"7680204","text":"The Perini Building Company is a division of Tutor Perini Corporation.

Tombstone of John Lawson After leaving the Navy in July 1865, he returned to the Philadelphia area, where he raised a large family and earned his living as a huckster. He died in Philadelphia on May 3, 1919 and was buried in Mount Peace Cemetery, Lawnside, New Jersey. He was 81. Over time, the tombstone which marked his grave subsided, fell, or was worn to the point that it became unreadable; additionally a fire at the cemetery offices destroyed burial records and the cemetery map, and his exact resting place is not known.

They may be of varying ethnicities and religions, including Arabs, Assyrians, Iraqi Turkmens, Kurds, Armenians, Jews, Mandeans, Muslims, and Yazidis. As of 2015, the number of Iraqi Americans is around 145,279, according to the United States Census Bureau. According to the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, 49,006 Iraqi foreign born immigrated to the United States between 1989 and 2001 and 25,710 Iraqi-born immigrants naturalized between 1991 and 2001. However, the 2000 United States Census reported that there were approximately 90,000 immigrants born in Iraq residing in the United States. History Overseas Iraqis in Maryland voting in the 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election The Iran‚ÄìIraq War, the Persian Gulf War, 13 years of sanctions, and the Iraq War resulted in many more Iraqis seeking refuge in the US. However, according to the 2000 US Census, in which it states that just under 90,000 people born in Iraq are resident in the United States. It has also covered information on the residents ancestry or ethnic origin, which show 33,000 people claiming only \\"Iraqi\\" ancestry, nearly 38,000 if those who wrote in another reply as well as \\"Iraqi\\" are included. A further 82,000 people were reported as \\"Assyrians/Chaldean/Syriac,\\" who are Christians. Nearly 206,000 others gave their ancestry as \\"Arabic\\" without specifying a country of origin, and many of them are likely to be from Iraq. Of those reporting Iraqi ancestry, 29 percent live in Michigan; 22% live in Texas and 20% in Illinois. Of those people reporting Assyrian ancestry, 42 percent live in Michigan. California has nearly 20 percent of the Iraqi American population. =Recent migration= The United States expedited the process in accepting Iraqi refugees since October 2007, but did not achieve its target of 12,000 such people for fiscal year 2008 as of February 2008. According to the State Department‚Äôs special coordinator for refugees from Iraq, 375 Iraqis arrived in the United States in January 2008 with refugee status, increasing the total of refugees absorbed since October to 1,432 at the beginning of the fiscal year. Whereas in the fiscal year of 2007, only a total of 3,040 refugees were received. Congress and other non-governmental organizations have criticized the US Administration for dealing with the pending issue of Iraqi refugees in such a slow manner, particularly those whose life is threatened for cooperating with US Forces. They also criticized the issue of the restricted number of Iraqi refugees allowed into the United States. The United States had set a target to receive 500 Iraqis annually who have worked for the US Government through a special visa program. To add to this issue, Congress recently introduced a new law to receive 5,000 Iraqis each year in the United States for having worked for the US Government or in the name of the United States and are facing dangerous threats in Iraq. Since the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the US has promised to increase the number of Iraqi refugees who will be allowed to settle in the United States from 500 to 7,000. There is a sizable Iraqi refugee population in Memphis, Tennessee. Demographics The states with the largest Iraqi foreign born populations are Michigan, California and Illinois. The cities with the largest Iraqi immigrant populations are Detroit, Chicago, San Diego and Phoenix. Nashville has the largest Kurdish population, with much of them emigrating from Iraq. More than one third of Iraqis now living in the United States entered as refugees or were granted refugee status after entering. Iraqi immigrants approximately represent 14 per cent of all immigrants from Western Asia, but compromise less than one per cent of the total foreign-born population in the United States. =Chicago= The largest and oldest Iraqi community in America is Chicago, home to the largest Assyrian population in the United States, numbering in the tens of thousands. Chicago's first Assyrians, primarily Christian, arrived around the turn of the twentieth century and settled along the northern lakefront, establishing a community church in Lincoln Park. While a majority of the early Assyrians came from Iran, beginning in the 1960s a growing number of Iraqi Assyrians began to migrate to Chicago. In the mid-1970s, nearly 1,000 Iraqi-born Assyrians were resettled in Chicago as refugees from the Lebanese Civil War, and throughout the 1980s and 1990s larger groups of refugees came to escape the Iran-Iraq War and the Gulf War of 1991. The new arrivals have sought residence along the lakefront in Uptown, Edgewater, Rogers Park, and nearby neighborhoods, while a growing number have moved to northern suburbs. Some community leaders have estimated up to 100,000 Assyrians in Illinois as of 2010. Arabs constitute the second largest group of Iraqi migrants to Chicago. Most of Chicago's estimated 6,500 Iraqi Arabs came to the United States in the late 1970s and early 1980s in search of economic opportunities. Highly educated Muslims, these Arab migrants have entered a range of professional occupations and settled largely in Northbrook and nearby suburbs. After the Persian Gulf War, a new wave of Arabs migrated to Chicago from southern Iraq to escape political persecution. Many of these new arrivals were prisoners of war who were flown to the United States from Saudi Arabia, and a large portion were Muslim Shi‚Äòa who had staged a failed uprising against Saddam Hussein in 1991 and feared reprisal. Arabs were leaders in establishing the Iraqi-American Association, which has a membership of 3,000 predominantly Arab Iraqis and offers assistance to community members. Kurds and Turkmens constitute small communities in Chicago, both groups are Muslim, but owing to their small size, less than 300 Kurds and 50 Turkmens attend the mosques of other communities. Each group maintains a distinct cultural identity and close ties with brethren outside of Chicago. =Outside Chicago= Iraqi Americans live across the U.S. with other hubs of Iraqis living in the Detroit, New York City, Nashville, Philadelphia, Boston, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. areas. Atlanta has developed a large Iraqi community in recent years. Over 20,000 Iraqi Americans reside in California (many tens of thousands live in San Diego and Los Angeles areas) but with the most concentrated in the communities of Modesto, Ceres and Turlock in Stanislaus County in Central Valley, mainly are descendants of agricultural laborers invited to work in the US in the 1920s. A quarter of Iraqi refugees to the U.S. settle in San Diego County. In 2010, Iraqis made up about one- quarter of El Cajon‚Äôs population of 96,000, with an estimated 7,000 Iraqis arriving in 2009. The city is believed to have the second-largest number of Iraqis in the country, most of them Assyrians belonging to the Chaldean Catholic Church. Religion =Iraqi Muslims= The Iraqi Muslims who migrated from Iraq are mostly Shia. They have large populations in Michigan (the majority in Detroit and Dearborn). Most Iraqi Muslims migrated following the 1991 uprisings in Iraq during Saddam Hussein's rule. Iraqi Muslims are very active today in Dearborn, MI. There are many mosques including Karbalaa Islamic Education Center, Imam Ali Center, Al-Rasool Community Center, Aljomhoor Alhusainy, and many more Islamic Mosques, Organizations, and Institutes. =Iraqi Christians= The Iraqi Christians who migrated from Iraq are mainly Assyrians (Chaldo-Assyrians). They have large populations in Michigan (the majority in Detroit), Illinois, New York, New Jersey and California. Many began migrating to the USA after the Assyrian Genocide during World War I. There are also some Iraqi Armenian Christians in the USA. Over half of the 64,000 Iraqi Americans in Michigan are Christian. =Iraqi Mandaeans= Several thousand Mandaean Iraqis currently live in the United States.Grant, David: Ancient Iraqi sect struggles to keep culture in US, Associated Press/AINA The majority live in Detroit, Michigan with communities in Chicago, Illinois (esp. in a section called Little Iraq); Worcester, Massachusetts; Paterson, New Jersey (Little Ramallah section); Long Island, New York; Houston, Texas; and perhaps in the largest Iraqi-American communities of Los Angeles, California; Orange County, California (Little Arabia in Anaheim, California) and San Diego, California. =Iraqi Jews= One of the oldest Iraqi communities in the United States follow Judaism. Jewish residents from Iraq began to emigrate to the American Continent at the turn of the twentieth century. The first known Iraqi Jewish immigrants to the United States arrived between the years 1900‚Äì1905. About twenty families immigrated from Baghdad to New York City. World War I (1914‚Äì1918), brought more Jewish immigrants from Iraq, in addition to the already existent Iraqi Jewish communities in the United States. Among them were at least sixty young individuals seeking education as well as business people looking for new and better opportunities. The eruption of World War II in 1939, resulted in more than seventy Babylonian Jewish families immigrating to the United States from Iraq. Other Jewish immigrants of Baghdadian ancestry arrived in Southern California from the Far East in the early 1920s. It is estimated that the total Iraqi Jewish population in the US exceeds 15,000 people, with large concentrations in California, New York, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts and New Jersey. Smaller known groups of Iraqi Jews, can also be found in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas, as well as other States. The members of the community are driven by ambition to succeed in businesses and as professionals, and this urge has been taking precedence over most other aims in life apart from family cohesion and religious observance during the High Holidays. High education is greatly valued, and almost every school graduate enters College after high school where he or she tends to specialize in a profession. In the early 1990s, a magazine called The Periodical Publication of Congregation Bene Naharayim was published in New York and it reaffirmed the pride of the Iraqi Jews in their ancient heritage, by linking it directly to the glorious traditions of the Babylonian Jewry. Another newsletter for the local Babylonian Jewish community in Los Angeles called \\"Yosef Haim\\" began to be published in 1996. It reports on what is taking place in the local Iraqi Jewish community.

Members live in alternative cooperative housing that they personally own and maintain. These houses are designed to lower housing costs while providing an educational and community environment for students to live and grow in. They are, in general, nonprofit, communal, and self-governing, with students pooling their monetary and personal resources to create a community style home. Many student housing cooperatives share operation and governing of the house. As with most cooperatives, student housing coops follow the Rochdale Principles and promote collaboration and community work done by the members for mutual benefit. Most student housing coops in Canada and the United States are members of North American Students of Cooperation. History Several of the earliest US student cooperatives (e.g. at Northwestern University and Wellesley College) had begun by at least 1915, for the purpose of housing female students.The Dean of Women By Lois Kimball Mathews Rosenberry Most student housing cooperatives are formed to provide an alternative dorm for students who are unable to afford college due to housing costs. For example, the Harriet E. Richards House Harriet E. Richards House at Boston University (1928) was established to provide a cheap alternative to dorm life for women scholars. The Berkeley Student Cooperative, amongst others, started during the Great Depression to help provide affordable food and housing for Berkeley students. Other early examples that started in the Depression years: the Cooperative Living Organization at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida founded in 1931 and the Michigan Socialist House at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan founded in 1932. Others were formed to provide a more inclusive and supportive environment for students. Many student housing cooperatives are focused around socialist principles or political activism (Michigan Socialist House), veganism or vegetarianism, racial or ethnic identity (Biko), or environmental concerns. Throughout the twentieth century, student housing cooperatives expanded, but some floundered. Many formed coalitions in the face of rising debt or bankruptcy. The North American Students of Cooperation (NASCO) was formed in 1968 as a way to link existing cooperatives together while educating and improving cooperatives across North America. Today, NASCO primarily serves as an association that promotes development and communication amongst coops and promotes communal living. Management of Student Housing Cooperatives There is not a standard way of running a housing cooperative. Most student housing cooperative members have full voting privileges on issues such as rent, future members, and community activity and then maintain an elected board of committee members who oversee the running of the cooperative. Many student housing cooperatives require work shifts that help lower the overall cost of living. These may include chores or cooking. Some coops award points to the type of chore and members are required to complete a certain number of points a week. All cooperatives expect members to contribute assistance throughout the year to keep the cooperative running smoothly and efficiently. It is up to the individual coops as to whether the members elect a board or committee to oversee the entire cooperative. Partial List of Student Housing Cooperatives =Canada= Student co- operatives are situated in close proximity to colleges and universities.

All operating coops and initiatives are members of Students for Cooperation, a UK wide federation of student co-operatives which includes a number of other groups across the UK working to establish student housing co-operatives. Students for Cooperation have conducted a primary report and are seeking to establish a National Body of Student Housing Cooperatives (NBSHC) to help support and grow the UK student housing cooperative movement.Creating a National Body of Student Housing Co-operativesFeasibility Study for a National Body of Student Housing Co-ops An unsuccessful plan to launch a student housing co-operative took place in 2004, when MMUnion partnered with the National Union of Students and Confederation of Co-operative Housing Confederation of Co-operative Housing to offer cheaper cooperatively owned alternatives to city housing for Manchester Metropolitan University students.

Shot over three years, Drowned Out follows one family‚Äôs stand against a government dam project which is set to destroy their home and their village. Plot The documentary follows the villagers of Jalsindhi ‚Äì a village in Madhya Pradesh on the banks of the Narmada River about 30 miles upstream from the Sardar Sarovar project - through their battle against the dam. The lead character is Luharia Sonkaria, who is the village‚Äôs medicine man, a role that was his father‚Äôs and grandfather‚Äôs before him. The government provides them no viable alternatives - they offer unusable land a hundred miles away or a small sum of money in compensation for their river-side land. The film documents hunger strikes, rallies, and a six-year Supreme Court case, and finally follows the villagers as the dam fills and the river starts to rise. The documentary features Arundhati Roy, who has been an outspoken activist bringing international attention to the controversy. Production The documentary was shot over three years on three separate trips to India by Franny Armstrong. Assisted by her sister in the first year and by an Australian camera operator in the second, Armstrong shot 80% of the film herself. There was no electricity ‚Äòon location‚Äô so Armstrong used a portable solar charger she purchased in the UK. Armstrong was put in jail for one night after the first day of filming. As she wrote in a feature article for The Guardian newspaper, she continued to live and work alongside the villagers and found this almost anthropological way of working helped her capture candid interviews; \\"Most of the best interviews were done in the last year - when I was on my own - because people really got to know and trust me\\". =Screening in Jalsindhi village= In August 2003, the Spanner Films crew returned to Jalsindhi village, where Drowned Out had been shot, to screen the film for the villagers. They made a makeshift cinema on the side of the village school, with a diesel generator for electricity, a bedsheet for a screen and a simple sound system. About 120 people from Jalsindhi and surrounding villages came to the screening, and for almost all of them it was the first time they had seen a moving image. Reception Time Out (London) chose Drowned Out as their Critics Choice, describing the documentary as \\"compassionate, disturbing and yet empowering\\". The Bermuda Royal Gazette, reviewing the film for a screening at the Bermuda International Film Festival said \\"Documentaries rarely, if ever, come better than this.\\" The San Francisco Chronicle called it \\"Heartbreaking\\" and Film Journal International said it is \\"A real eye opener.\\" The OneWorld Media Awards Jury called the documentary \\"a powerful and masterfully crafted study\\", and New Internationalist described it as \\"Quiet, fierce, beautiful.\\" Awards Nominated for Best Documentary in the BIFAs Runner up in San Francisco Film Festival Best Documentary Distribution Drowned Out has been screened in numerous cinemas and on numerous TV channels around the world. Producers estimate millions of people have seen the film, primarily on TV round the world (including PBS in America). It was released on DVD in 2004 and can be downloaded or streamed from the Spanner Films website.

While still a child, Ansanus was secretly baptized by his nurse Maxima (venerated as St. Maxima of Rome) and was secretly brought up as a Christian. Ansanus openly declared his Christian faith during the persecutions of Diocletian, when he was nineteen years old. According to tradition, St. Ansanus preached the Gospel in Bagnoregio (then Bagnorea) and the church of Santa Maria delle Carceri outside the Alban Gate was said to have been built above the prison in which he was confined. According to tradition, Ansanus and Maxima were scourged; Maxima died from this. Ansanus, however, survived this torture, as well as the next one: being thrown into a pot of boiling oil. He was then taken to the city of Siena as a prisoner. He managed to preach Christianity there and make many converts to this religion. He was decapitated by order of Roman Emperor Diocletian. It is also said that his own father denounced him to the authorities, but Ansanus managed to escape, and converted many at Bagnorea and later at Siena.

It is located in the Marcia and John Price Museum Building in Salt Lake City, Utah on the University of Utah campus near Rice- Eccles Stadium. Works of art are displayed on a rotating basis. It is a university and state art museum. Overview Many free public programs are continuing through the closure period, including the museum's popular Third Saturday for families,Third Saturday educational outreach, K‚Äì12 educational outreach and ARTLandish: Land Art, Landscape, and the Environment.ARTLandish: Land Art, Landscape, and the Environment The UMFA's Dumke Auditorium, museum store, and museum cafe have reopened to the public. UMFA is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. It has a cafe and store located inside the building along with more than 20 galleries. The museums permanent art collections include over 17,000 works of art. The different cultures represented include African, Oceanic and the New World, Asian, European, American, and the Ancient and Classical World. History The creation of a formal art gallery on the top floor of the University of Utah's Park Building in the early 1900s marks the beginning of the Utah Museum of Fine Arts. In the beginning, paintings by local artists filled this three-room gallery. Through the next six decades, the art department at the University of Utah received major art gifts and specific requests from donors to remodel the gallery into a museum. After the renovation of the gallery was finished, the University‚Äôs president, A. Ray Olpin, established it as the Utah Museum of Fine Arts on May 6, 1951. In 1967, Frank Sanquineti was appointed as the first professional director. By this time, the museum had entered a new period of growth which resulted in the building of a new museum. After the museum‚Äôs relocation in 1970, its goal was to expand its collections, and the Annual Friends of the Art Museum Acquisition Fund was formed. Over the years this annual fund has helped support the expansion of the museum‚Äôs collections and its ability to offer art education programs. Due to donations from patrons, local and national foundations, the University community, and the citizens of the State of Utah, the UMFA‚Äôs collection now encompasses 5,200 years of artistic creativity. Since the mid-1900s, when the collection was around 800 objects, it has grown to over 13,000 art objects. This huge expansion required the building of yet another museum, and construction of a new building was started in 1997. The UMFA opened in the Marcia and John Price Museum Building on June 2, 2001, and David Dee was appointed Executive Director the following year. Since the second relocation, the UMFA has experienced unprecedented growth in all areas of operation. In February 2005, the Utah State Legislature declared the UMFA as an official state institution, confirming the importance of the museum‚Äôs role as a center for art, culture, and education in the state of Utah. In April 2009, David Dee resigned from the museum and Gretchen Dietrich was named Executive Director effective August 2010. Collections Works of the European tradition from the 14th to the 19th centuries include such artists as Filippo Lippi, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Jan Brueghel the Younger, Anthony van Dyck, Giovanni Paolo Panini, Hyacinthe Rigaud, Jean- Honor√© Fragonard, √âlisabeth Vig√©e Le Brun, Thomas Gainsborough, Jean-Baptiste- Camille Corot, and Auguste Rodin. Represented American artists include Benjamin West, Gilbert Stuart, Thomas Cole, Albert Bierstadt, and John Singer Sargent. Modern and contemporary holdings include Helen Frankenthaler, Yayoi Kusama, Nancy Holt, and Robert Smithson. The museum's non-Western collections have particular strength in works from India, Polynesia, and Mesoamerica. Restitution of art stolen in the Holocaust In August 2004, the museum learned that an oil painting that had been stolen during The Holocaust had found its way into the museum's collection by donation in 1993. The museum returned the art to the heirs of its original owner. The piece was the 18th- century Les Amoureaux Jeunes by Fran√ßois Boucher.

As a basketball player at the University of California, Los Angeles, Stanich was a guard and led his team to its first NCAA tournament appearance in 50. He scored 9 points in the East- West All-Star Game and was a first-team all-American (as named by Converse), the first of 24 Bruins who would earn this honor under John Wooden. As a Bruin baseball player, he was a pitcher for 3 seasons, including throwing a 5-hit shutout as a sophomore as UCLA beat USC for the first time in five years. He would become a professional baseball player after graduation, pitching for the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, as well as Idaho Falls Russets and Stockton.

It was also published under the title Island of the Aunts. It was a Publishers Weekly bestsellerLatest Children's Fiction Books Best Sellers on Publishers Weekly - 12/24/2001 and a School Library Journal Best Book of 2000.Best Books 2000 - 12/1/2000 - School Library Journal Plot The three sisters take care of injured and sick creatures, but the work is getting too much for them as they get older. They decide to go to London to \\"choose\\" (kidnap) children to help them. Etta kidnaps a young girl named Minette, whose constantly bickering parents are separated. Coral brings a boy named Fabio, originally from Brazil, where he is learning to be an \\"English gentleman\\" at the horrible Graymarsh Towers. Myrtle is forced to bring a boy named Lambert, whom she thinks is horrid, after he accidentally sniffs chloroform. When Dorothy is released from prison, Betty sends the spoiled Boo-Boo and Little One with her to the island to be looked after when she breaks her hip and apparently kills herself. On the island, Minette and Fabio are quickly put to work on the bed. they carry stranded jellyfish back to the sea and holding an eel with scabies. Meanwhile, Lambert is kept in his room because he refuses to help so he does other inappropriate things . One day, though, Etta introduces them to a small family of mermaids, part of the menagerie of exotic creatures who sought refuge on the island. The children also meet the Stoorworm, a wingless Icelandic dragon, the egg-bound boobrie (a bird apparently similar to the dodo, but vastly larger) and even talking with the selkies (seals) who can change into humans (they were told if you stab a selkie with a knife it will turn into a human.) Lambert is shocked at the discovery, but Fabio tells them they are hallucinations caused by drugs put in their food. This keeps Lambert quiet, but more determined to be rescued. After some time, the Great Kraken begins swimming the seas to bring peace to the waters once more. Initially accompanied with his child, he leaves it with the Aunts (\\"blessing\\" the island) and because it is too young to travel the world with its father. The little Kraken instantly misses his father but quickly befriends Minette and Fabio. Back in London, word spreads about the two \\"kidnappers\\". Minette's parents have a \\"war\\" as they try to outdo each other's \\"sorrow for their loss\\" in the news and Fabio's strict grandparents consider suing the police for not doing their job. Lambert, though, finally gets a hold of his mobilephone, which he uses to call his father, Mr. Sprott, for help. When Sprott reaches his son and sees all the fantastical creatures on the Island as a chance, he captures them. He reports the island's location to the police who immediately fly off to rescue Minette and Fabio. The two quickly come up with an idea and lead the police to believe Boo-Boo and Little One are the aunt's victims. They are quickly flown back to London and leave the real children free to attempt to rescue their friends, though eventually the Kraken returns and overpowers Sprott's yacht just when all hope is lost. Everyone is rescued, though Sprott and Lambert believe everything that happened was all a hallucination. The Kraken chooses to bring his son with him on his journey. With the \\"kidnappers\\" finally revealed, the aunts are put on trial. Minette and Fabio, however, present an argument that convinces the jury that they are innocent. Fabio is allowed to return home to Brazil, and Minette's parents call a truce. The aunts write a will, leaving the island to both Minette and Fabio, who promise to return one day.
