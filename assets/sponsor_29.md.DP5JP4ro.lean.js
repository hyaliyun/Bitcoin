The song was Glenn Miller's first known composition and was an early collaboration between Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman, who would become the most successful bandleaders of the Big Band Era during the 1930s and 1940s.

The instrumental was recorded on June 23, 1928 in New York and was released as a 78, 4013, on Brunswick, paired with \\"Jungle Blues\\".In the liner notes to the 1950 Brunswick LP, Chicago Jazz Classics, BL 58015, by Benny Goodman and His Boys, music critic and historian Irving Kolodin gives the recording date as June 4, 1928, and the location as New York. The album was also released as a 78 RPM album B-1007. The instrumental, Matrix # E27639=C, was described as a \\"shimmy one-step\\" on the original Brunswick 78 label as released in 1928. The personnel that made up \\"Bennie Goodman's Boys\\" for the studio recording of \\"Room 1411\\" was made up of an all-star ensemble that featured Glenn Miller on trombone, Ray Bauduc on drums, Dick \\"Icky\\" Morgan on guitar, Fud Livingston on tenor saxophone, Jimmy McPartland on cornet, Vic Breidis on piano, Harry Goodman on tuba, and Benny Goodman on clarinet and baritone saxophone. The band continued to record in 1928 and 1929. Tommy Dorsey on trombone, Bud Freeman on tenor saxophone, Wingy Manone on trumpet, and Ben Pollack on drums, were also members of the group on other sessions. Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman lived in the same suite at the time in the apartments in The Whitby in New York whose number was 1411. The title of the composition derives from the apartment number. In Hear Me Talkin' To Ya: The Story Of Jazz As Told By The Men Who Made It (1955) by Nat Shapiro and Nat Hentoff, Jimmy McPartland recalled how the title originated: \\"[A]fter a couple of weeks we moved into the Whitby Apartments, where Gil Rodin, Dick Morgan, Benny Goodman, and Glenn Miller had a suite. We all moved into that, practically the whole band. ... The number of that apartment was 1411. And that is how that title came up, Room 1411, by Benny Goodman's Boys.\\"Kolodin gives a different explanation for the origin of the title in his liner notes to the 1950 Brunswick LP, BL 58015. He wrote that \\"[a]ccording to legend\\", the title refers to the room number where Chicago publisher and lyricist Walter Melrose stayed during an illness at the Hotel Manager (later the Taft) in New York City. Because he bought the tune from Goodman and Miller, they named the song after the room in gratitude. He quoted Glenn Miller as noting: \\"When we sold this thing and divided the proceeds, we decided that the song-writing racket was a push-over.\\" Benny Goodman played baritone saxophone \\"on the more straight-ahead Chicago-style 'Room 1411'\\".Firestone, Ross.

Organization The organization was established under the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA), which was sponsored by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and was ratified in 1985. Its mandate was renewed by the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994 and again by the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006, which aims to promote sustainable management and legal harvesting of forests that produce tropical timber, and to promote expansion and diversification of international timber trade from these forests. The governing body is the International Tropical Timber Council (ITTC). Half the votes on the ITTC are assigned to producing countries and half to consumers. Within each block, votes are assigned based on market share. Mandate and activities The ITTO was at first primarily a commodity organization, regulating the international trade in tropical timber. The original mandate mentioned conservation but did not give any details. In 1990 the ITTC proposed that by 2000 all exports of tropical timber would come from sustainably managed sources, and this goal was adopted. In 1987 the ITTO commissioned the Harvard Institute for International Development to prepare a review of current knowledge of multiple-use management of tropical forests. Of interest was the potential for non-timber forest products and services that could assist in sustaining the forests. HIID completed the study in 1988 and issued updated versions in 1990 and 1992.

St. Louis also played a role in the American Civil War. James Wilkinson, first governor of the Louisiana Territory, including St. Louis Changes in government and politics After the last Spanish lieutenant governor surrendered upper Louisiana and St. Louis to Amos Stoddard, representative of France and the United States, Stoddard was given civil command of the territory (march-october 1804) until the U.S. Congress acted further.Primm (1998), 72. Stoddard quickly established a citizens' committee (led by leading Creole families) to write local regulations. However, Congress passed an organization law that separated the Louisiana Purchase at the 33rd parallel, with the upper part including St. Louis to be called the District of Louisiana and governed by officials from the Indiana Territory. The district was divided into subdistricts that included St. Louis, St. Charles, and Ste. Genevieve, among others. The act also banned the foreign slave trade and nullified any land grants greater than 640 acres made after October 1, 1800.Primm (1998), 73. Most wealthy Creoles found the new organization law to be particularly repulsive, if not for its threat toward slavery then due to its reduction of the significance of St. Louis. The Creole families and Americans who held large Spanish land grants thus petitioned Congress in 1804 to review the system. The petition received support from the territorial governor, William Henry Harrison, and in July 1805, Congress reorganized the District of Louisiana as the Louisiana Territory, with its territorial capital at St. Louis.Primm (1998), 76. The new reorganization also created a land claims board that would review large land grant claims to determine their legitimacy. Jefferson quickly appointed James Wilkinson as the new territorial governor, with John Coburn, Rufus Easton, and John Baptiste Charles Lucas as territorial judges.Primm (1998), 78. Both Easton and Lucas remained fixtures of St. Louis government well into the 19th century. By 1806, Wilkinson had become widely unpopular in St. Louis due to his interference with the land claims review board and refusal to convene a territorial legislature.Primm (1998), 80. Wilkinson also had befriended Aaron Burr, which provoked rumors that the two were planning a western rebellion. Wilkinson thus was removed from office in May 1806 and replaced in early 1807 by Meriwether Lewis, explorer and co-namesake of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, who took office in March 1808.Primm (1998), 81. Lewis's tenure was short, however, as he died on a trip to Washington, D.C. in late 1809.Primm (1998), 100. The population of the city expanded slowly after the Louisiana Purchase, but with expansion came increased desire to incorporate St. Louis as a town, allowing it to create local ordinances without the approval of the territorial legislature.Primm (1998), 96. After a failed effort in 1808, the local district court approved a petition from the town to incorporate, and on November 27, 1809, the first Board of Trustees were elected to represent the citizens of the town. The Board of Trustees was composed primarily of members of the Creole elite and newly arrived Americans: Auguste Chouteau, William C. Carr, Jean Cabanne, Edward Hempstead, and William Christy, with Chouteau chosen as the chairman. The Board primarily concerned itself with slave control, except for one ordinance banning horse racing on city streets.Primm (1998), 97. Other ordinances created volunteer fire department companies, required the removal of dead animals from the town, and created a streets overseer who was able to order males to work on streets adjacent to their property.Primm (1998), 99. The town also enacted a small property tax and obtained some revenue from issuing business licenses. The Board of Trustees established a constabulary to enforce its ordinances, which consisted of four men who served without pay, chosen on a rotating basis from among the adult men of the town. The district and town jail was located in the former masonry tower, known as Fort San Carlos, built by Leyba for the Battle of St. Louis in 1780. Crime remained relatively rare until the 1810s; the city's first murder occurred in 1817. In 1812, the Louisiana Territory was renamed the Missouri Territory, and from 1812 to 1821, St. Louis remained the capital of the territory.Primm (1998), 101. In addition to renaming the territory, all subdistricts (such as St. Louis, St. Charles, Ste. Genevieve, etc.) were renamed as counties. In the new territorial legislature, St. Louis County (which at that time included the town of St. Louis) was entitled to four representatives, the most of any county. The St. Louis Courthouse, completed in 1828 after a land donation by Auguste Chouteau After the end of the War of 1812, the population of St. Louis and the Missouri Territory began expanding quickly. Between 1804 and 1810, the town increased from 1,200 to 1,400, while from 1810 to 1820, the town population more than tripled from 1,400 to 4,600.Primm (1998), 104. It was during this influx of population that Auguste Chouteau and J.B.C. Lucas subdivided their land the west of Third Street, adding lots west through Seventh Street and doubling the width of the east-west streets. Chouteau and Lucas also donated a lot to be used as a county courthouse, where in 1828 the Old St. Louis County Courthouse was constructed. The population increase also stirred interest in statehood for Missouri; nearly all of the St. Louis elites (both Creole and American) supported statehood as a way of increasing their political power in the region.Primm (1998), 114. In December 1818, Congress debated over the admission of Missouri, ending its debate with the Missouri Compromise and an Enabling Act in March 1820 that authorized Missouri to elect a state government and create a state constitution.Primm (1998), 116. The constitutional convention of Missouri began work on June 12, 1820 in the Mansion House Hotel on Third Street in St. Louis, completing and adopting the Missouri Constitution on July 19, 1820.Primm (1998), 117. After statehood, the first General Assembly met at the Missouri Hotel in St. Louis, where the legislature selected St. Charles as a temporary home for the state capital until Jefferson City was completed as the permanent capital. St. Louisans had \\"no apparent regrets\\" at their loss of capital status, as they made little attempt to garner it. William Carr Lane, first mayor of St. Louis (1823‚Äì1826) Among the early decisions of the General Assembly was to take up a petition from St. Louis for incorporation as a city with a charter. The first St. Louis city charter was approved by the legislature on December 9, 1822, which was subject to city voters approval (which then passed by a margin of 107 to 90).Primm (1998), 118‚Äì119. The first mayor of the city was a recently arrived American physician, William Carr Lane, who defeated city founder Auguste Chouteau by a vote of 122‚Äì70 in April 1823.Primm (1998), 120. A nine-member Board of Aldermen also were elected (replacing the earlier Board of Trustees), and the city limits were expanded west to Seventh Street and north and south by approximately 5 blocks each. The focus of the early city government was on improvements to the riverfront and city health conditions. In 1823, the aldermen voted to regrade and pave Main (First) Street, and in 1824 voted for a general ordinance to pave streets and sidewalks and to create alleyways in all city blocks. However, the paving progress was slow and most streets remained dirt through the 1830s. In addition to the paving program, the aldermen voted to rename the streets, with north-south streets officially being given numbers, while east-west streets being named after trees.Primm (1998), 122.East-west streets, aside from Market, had not been given names by Laclede in the original system, and instead locally were given a north-south designation along with a letter (North A Street, South B Street, etc.). Mayor Lane and two aldermen were originally Pennsylvanians, and so persuaded the Board of Aldermen to adopt the Philadelphia system of tree names for east-west streets. Catholic revival and growth of Protestantism in St. Louis The transfer of Louisiana to the United States caused the Catholic Church in St. Louis considerable financial hardship; prior to the transfer, the Spanish government had paid all church operating expenses, and so no tithing was necessary among the citizens.Primm (1998), 91. Thus the resident priest of St. Louis left in 1804, and local Catholics were given periodic services by a traveling priest from Ste. Genevieve roughly six times a year until 1818. In spite of the problems, baptisms continued at the church in St. Louis, with roughly 400 whites and 100 blacks baptized between 1804 and 1816.Primm (1998), 92. In 1815, Louis William Valentine Dubourg, the apostolic administrator of New Orleans, was assigned to the bishopric of the newly created Diocese of Louisiana and the Floridas (which had been separated from the Diocese of New Orleans, and he established his episcopal see in St. Louis. Upon his arrival in early January 1818, Bishop Dubourg ordered the demolition of the decayed log church built under Cruzat and replaced it with a brick church on the same church block.Primm (1998), 93. The new church, 135 by 40 feet in size, cost more than $24,000 and its interior was never completed, although the first mass was celebrated in it on December 25, 1819.Primm (1998), 94. Dubourg departed St. Louis to return to New Orleans permanently in 1822, but his recruitment of resident priests, establishment of a seminary, and the reconstruction of the church improved the standing of the Catholic Church in St. Louis. By 1826, a separate St. Louis diocese was created with Joseph Rosati named as the first bishop in 1827. Protestants began to receive services in their homes led by itinerant ministers starting in the late 1790s, but most were quickly required to remove to American territory prior to the Louisiana Purchase. After the purchase, the Baptists organized a congregation in 1807 and built a log church in 1815 on Fee Fee Creek (well beyond St. Louis town limits). Only in 1818 was a Protestant church built within St. Louis, organized by Baptist missionary John Mason Peck with eleven members claiming membership in the First Baptist Church.Primm (1998), 95. Itinerant Methodist ministers also reached the town during the early years after the purchase, but only formed a congregation in 1821. The third Protestant group to affect St. Louis was the Presbyterian Church, which was organized originally as a Bible reading society in 1811 by Charles Gratiot Sr., William C. Carr, and Stephen Hempstead (father of Edward Hempstead). Two Presbyterian missionaries preached in St. Louis in 1816, but it was only December 1817 before a church was organized. The fourth Protestant group to take root was the Episcopal Church, founded in 1825 when Thomas Horrell became the first rector of the Christ Church Episcopal Church. Regardless of the new churches and revival of Catholicism, however, most of the population was uninterested in organized religion or were agnostic.Primm (1998), 96. Early commerce and the Panic of 1819 The commerce of the town after the Louisiana Purchase remained focused on the fur trade; trade operations in St. Louis were led by the Chouteau family and its alliance with the Osages and by Manuel Lisa and his Missouri Fur Company.Primm (1998), 123. These early operations largely depended on trading posts near Indian villages, where Indians and some white trappers could exchange furs for goods.Primm (1998), 125. Benefiting from the expertise of these traders was the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which left St. Louis in May 1804, reached the Pacific Ocean in the summer of 1805, and returned on September 23, 1806. The fur trade remained the basis of the wealth of elite St. Louis Creole families such as the Chouteaus well into the early 1820s. An 1814 photo engraving of the St. Louis fur trading post. The photo is believed to be the oldest of St. Louis as of at least 1964 according to the St. Louis Post Dispatch. Starting in the early 1810s with the growth of American families moving to St. Louis, brick buildings began to be built in the town.Primm (1998), 83. Architecture reflected the American style as well, with more frame houses and log buildings than the Creole style of the original village. American business practices also took hold, with signage and advertising of services on buildings present by about 1810. These early American and immigrant families began opening new businesses, including printing and banking, starting in the 1810s. Among the early printers to settle in St. Louis was and Irish immigrant named Joseph Charless, who published the first newspaper west of the Mississippi, the Missouri Gazette, in St. Louis on July 12, 1808.Primm (1998), 86. Charless printed government proceedings, international news, birth and death notices, and his own editorials, but generally refused to print information about duels.Primm (1998), 88. Also during the 1810s, St. Louis merchants began facing the problem of too little bullion currency and an increase in the supply of unreliable paper currency issued by banks in Kentucky and Ohio.Primm (1998), 105. To improve upon the de facto barter economy of St. Louis, in December 1816 a group of merchants formed the Bank of St. Louis, which was chartered by the territorial legislature and accepted furs as collateral. However, the bank failed as a result of mismanagement and fraud on the part of its cashier.Primm (1998), 106. In early 1817, another group of merchants formed the Bank of Missouri, which initially was successful and became a United States depository bank with $150,000 in guaranteed deposits. However, the Second Bank of the United States contracted its currency policy in late 1818, causing the Panic of 1819 and the eventual closure of the Bank of Missouri.Primm (1998), 107. The effect of the Panic of 1819 and subsequent depression slowed commercial activity in St. Louis until the mid-1820s.Primm (1998), 122. By 1824 and 1825, however, St. Louis businesses began outfitting an increasing number of farmers going west, while other merchants supplied military forces going to western outposts.Primm (1998), 108. St. Louis also had increasing connections with eastern markets after the introduction of the steamboat; the first steamboat to arrive in St. Louis, the Zebulon M. Pike, docked on August 2, 1817. By the time of the economic recovery of the mid-1820s, steamboats were common on the Mississippi and at the St. Louis docks. Rapids north of the city made St. Louis the northernmost navigable port for many large riverboats, and the Pike and other ships soon transformed St. Louis into a bustling inland port.Primm (1998), 135. Henry Lewis. Antebellum economic expansion Diversification in products available in St. Louis took place during the economic recovery, largely as a result of the new steamboat power.Primm (1998), 134. Confectioneries, jewelers, bookstores, musical instrument shops, lumber yards, and mortuaries all opened for the first time in the late 1820s and 1830s. Banking began to reestablish itself in the late 1830s with brokerage and insurance firms also offering deposits, until a banking crisis again forced liquidation of several companies in the early 1840s.Primm (1998), 139. Wholesalers also began to operate during the 1830s, supplying retail establishments from large company warehouses in the city.Primm (1998), 141. The city's Merchants Exchange, founded in 1836, was the first commodity- trading exchange in the United States. Also, the fur trade continued as a major commercial venture through the 1820s and into the 1830s. After the Panic of 1819 and the economic depression, the fur trade had shifted from being based on trading with Indians and trappers to one based on directly trapping and shipping furs. Among the pioneers of this method was the company known as the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, which departed from St. Louis in April 1822 and included mountain men such as Jim Bridger, Jedediah Smith, Thomas Fitzpatrick, Jim Beckwourth, and Etienne Provost.Primm (1998), 126. The Rocky Mountain group eventually was forced from business by the American Fur Company, owned by John Jacob Astor, but the western fur trade remained headquartered in St. Louis.Primm (1998), 128. However, by the late 1830s and early 1840s, changes in fashion meant that beaver fur no longer was in demand, although St. Louis continued as a hub of buffalo hides and other furs. As commercial trade resumed, so did construction and physical development of the city.Primm (1998), 132. The construction of the Old St. Louis County Courthouse in the late 1820s encouraged other growth, with an addition of western lots to Ninth Street and a new city hall adjacent to the river in 1833. Between 1833 and 1845, another 31 additions were made to the city, extending the western edge to 14th Street. The military post at Fort Bellefontaine (north of the city along the Missouri River) moved and expanded in 1826 to Jefferson Barracks, roughly ten miles south of St. Louis on the Mississippi River.Primm (1998), 133. In tandem, the army purchased 37 acres three miles south of the city to build an armory, prompting an industrial addition and railroad line south to Iron Mountain, Missouri.Primm (1998), 144. Another addition to the north of the city connected the town of Bremen, which was then annexed by St. LouisPrimm (1998), 145. The 1830s saw dramatic growth in the city's population: by 1830, the city population had increased to 5,832 from roughly 4,500 in 1820. By 1835, the city population reached 8,316, doubled by 1840 to 16,439, doubled again by 1845 to 35,390, and again by 1850 to 77,860.Primm (1998), 143.Primm (1998), 147. By 1850, St. Louis had become the largest U.S. city west of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the second-largest port in the country, with a commercial tonnage exceeded only by New York City. The St. Louis levee on the Mississippi River in 1857 Infrastructure improvements In large part due to the rapid growth of the 1830s and 1840s, cholera became a significant problem in St. Louis. In December 1848, cholera cases were reported after several steamboats crowded with immigrants likely brought the disease.Primm (1998), 155. In the spring and summer of 1849, cholera spread throughout the population to epidemic proportions, killing nearly 5,000 people.The 1849 cholera epidemic also was responsible for the death of Pierre Chouteau, the last of St. Louis's original settlers. Primm (1998), 157. As a solution to the cholera problem, city officials constructed a sewer system to drain sinkholes that had become clogged with sewage and garbage.Primm (1998), 157. In addition to the nearly 31 miles of sewer pipe built by 1861, cemeteries were removed to the outskirts of the town to Bellefontaine Cemetery and Calvary Cemetery to reduce groundwater contamination, and a large mill pond was drained in 1851.Primm (1998), 146. In the same year of the 1849 cholera epidemic, a large fire broke out on a steamboat on the levee, spread to 23 other boats, then destroyed a large portion of the center city.Primm (1998), 167. Property losses were estimated at $6.1 million, while thousands became unemployed, hundreds lost their homes, and dozens of major businesses were destroyed. In response to the fire, streets were widened, the wharf was improved,Primm (1998), 168. and a new building code required structures to be built of stone or brick. The levee also saw significant improvement during the 1850s. In the first half of the 19th century, a second channel developed in the Mississippi River at St. Louis.Primm (1998), 149. An island (nicknamed Bloody Island for the duels fought there) formed between the two channels, and a smaller island (Duncan's Island) developed below St. Louis.Primm (1998), 150. It was feared that the levee at St. Louis might be left high and dry, and federal assistance was sought and obtained with a grant of $50,000 in 1851. Using the engineering planning of Robert E. Lee, levees were constructed in 1852 and 1853 on the Illinois side to direct water toward Missouri and eliminate the second channel, joining Bloody Island to the land on the Illinois side and washing away Duncan's Island by 1855. One final component of city infrastructure that was created before the Civil War was the city's water system. Originally, city residents used river water, hauled directly from the riverbank slightly north of the city.Primm (1998), 151.Although water from springs and the mill pond west of town was cleaner, St. Louisans believed drinking the muddy river water promoted health; no less than Mark Twain noted that the water was \\"too thick to drink and too thin to plow,\\" except that native citizens would \\"stir it up and take the draught as they would gruel.\\" Primm (1998), 151. Starting in 1830, a pumping station and reservoir was built on top of a Native American mound, but it quickly became inadequate to the city's needs. In 1843 and 1845 the station and reservoir were expanded, but again proved inadequate.Primm (1998), 152. Four new reservoirs were built between 1849 and 1860, but prior to the Civil War, there was no significant improvement in water quality or supply. Central High School, built in 1855 at the northeast corner of Olive and 15th streets, was the first public high school in St. Louis. Education before the Civil War Joseph Charless, printer of the Missouri Gazette, also published the first book in the Missouri Territory (about territorial laws) and operated a bookstore.Primm (1998), 89. In addition, most wealthy individuals in St. Louis also owned private book collections. However, a sizable proportion of adults remained illiterate. Early schools in St. Louis were all fee-based and mostly conducted lessons in French.Primm (1998), 90. The first substantial educational effort came about under the authority of the Catholic Church, which in 1818 opened Saint Louis Academy, later renamed Saint Louis University, offering courses in divinity, philosophy, languages, and mathematics.Primm (1998), 91. However, the academy primarily catered to seminary students rather than the general public. Later, in the 1840s and 1850s, Catholic schools offered education to more than 3,000 students in at least ten parochial schools.Primm (1998), 166. Public education in St. Louis began in 1838, when the city Board of Aldermen voted to levy a common lands income tax to support two elementary schools, known as North and South schools.Primm (1998), 315. A third school opened in 1841, called Benton School, offering instruction in basic writing, reading, and mathematics. Initially the schools required students to pay fees, but by 1847 tax levies allowed for free public education and expansion of the system. By 1854, the system had 27 schools and served nearly 4,000 students, in 1855 a high school was opened with considerable fanfare, and by 1860, nearly 12,000 students had enrolled in the St. Louis Public Schools. The district also opened a normal school in 1857, which later became Harris-Stowe State University.Primm (1998), 316. Slavery and racism in St. Louis Missouri was admitted as a slave state in 1821. Many slaveholders had migrated to the territory from Kentucky and Tennessee, and settled with slaves along the central Missouri River, in an area that became known as \\"Little Dixie\\", as well as in the delta area of the Bootheel. Many free blacks and slaves lived and worked in St. Louis, as domestics, artisans, crew on the riverboats and laborers at the wharves. After the admission of Missouri as a slave state, the owning and sale of slaves continued in St. Louis, although as the town grew, the percentage of the population held as slaves declined.Hodes (2009), 15. The treatment of slaves in St. Louis as compared with other areas is unclear; some evidence suggests mild to harsh treatment, and it is clear that many slaves attempted to escape. Slave sales occurred usually through advertising in newspapers, with transactions conducted in hotels or private homes.Hodes (2009), 16. Slaves often were held in the St. Louis jail prior to their movement to a particular farm or to a dealer.Hodes (2009), 16. Many slaves worked on steamboats as crew or as laborers on the riverfront, and some escaped across the river to the free state of Illinois, continuing via the Underground Railroad to Canada. Some slaves also were hired out by their owners for farm or commercial work for periods of up to a year. Dred Scott, whose famous case to gain his freedom began as a lawsuit filed in St. Louis in 1846 The availability of work meant that slaves could earn wages, and some were able to save money to purchase their freedom or that of relatives.Hodes (2009), 20. One such example was that of John Berry Meachum, a cooper who purchased his own freedom, then worked to purchase his family and others from slavery. Meachum later became a Baptist minister and founded the African Baptist Church of St. Louis. Other slaves were freed via manumission after some period of service, such as was the case of a slave named Francis who was emancipated by Auguste Chouteau in 1826. From 1828 to 1865, just under 1,000 slaves gained their freedom, out of a total population of slaves never higher than 2,600.African American Life in Saint Louis, 1804‚Äì1865 from the Records of St. Louis' Courts, National Park Service (See links for list of 1,000 emancipations, escapes, slave sales, etc.), accessed 12 January 2011 In addition to the practice of manumission and self- emancipation, some slaves gained their freedom through freedom suits, lawsuits allowed under an 1824 Missouri state law designed to protect free blacks from enslavement by allowing them to sue for their freedom. Among the earliest of these freedom suits was brought by the Scypion family.Hodes (2009), 18. Marie Jean Scypion, an enslaved half Indian, should technically have been freed at the beginning of Spanish rule in the 1760s with the O'Reilly decree; in 1805, her daughter Marguerite sued for freedom and initially won in court, a decision which was reversed by the Missouri Territorial Court. After statehood, Tayon sold the family to Jean Pierre Chouteau (brother of Auguste Chouteau). In 1825, Marguerite again filed a freedom suit, this time under the 1824 Missouri state law. After several appeals, including to the Missouri Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court, Marguerite Scypion won her case in 1836, freeing the Scypion family and ending Indian slavery in Missouri. In 1846, the slaves Dred Scott and his wife Harriet sued for freedom, in a case heard at the Old Courthouse, based on their having traveled and lived with their master in free states. Although the state ruled in his favor, an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court resulted in an 1857 ruling against them. The Supreme Court ruled that slaves could not be counted as citizens. This decision overturned the basis of the Missouri Compromise. The year of the decision, both of the Scotts were emancipated by their master's family. Including the Scypion family case and the Dred Scott case, three hundred and one freedom suits were filed in St. Louis courts from 1814 to 1860. However, slaves gained freedom in less than half of them.\\"Freedom Suits\\", St. Louis Circuit Court Records, Missouri Historical Society (St. Louis, MO), accessed 4 January 2011, See link to searchable database\\"Freedom Suits\\", African-American Life in St. Louis, 1804‚Äì1865, from the Records of the St. Louis Courts, Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, National Park Service, accessed 11 January 2011 Immigration and nativism in St. Louis Adolphus Busch, photographed by fellow German-Americans Hermann Hoelke and Robert Benecke, c. 1860s During the economic expansion of the 1830s, Irish and German immigration to St. Louis increased substantially.Hodes (2009), 8. In particular, the writings of Gottfried Duden encouraged German immigration to the Midwest, and St. Louis in particular.Hodes (2009), 11. By the early 1830s the German population of St. Louis had become significant enough to be regarded as a bloc by the Americans and French.Hodes (2009), 12. Indeed, on a single day in December 1833 more than 500 immigrants from Germany arrived in the town.Hodes (2009), 13. German immigration continued in the 1840s and 1850s, particularly after the failure of the Revolutions of 1848.Primm (1998), 164. The second major group of pre- Civil War immigrants came from Ireland, including both Catholic and Protestant Irish.Hodes (2009), 14. Although in other regions Irish immigrants were equated with poverty during the 1820s and 1830s, the early Irish community of St. Louis in the 1830s often included wealthy, politically powerful and influential members, such as John Mullanphy, Alexander McNair, and John O'Fallon. However, starting in the mid-1840s large numbers of Irish fled poverty abroad and arrived in St. Louis with little money or skills. Many of these Irish were motivated by the Great Famine of 1845‚Äì1846 and the failed Irish uprising of 1848.Primm (1998), 164. Nativist sentiment increased in St. Louis during the late 1840s, leading to a mob attack in 1844 on Saint Louis University and attacks on naturalized citizens in the April 1844 election.Primm (1998), 165. However, the increased number of naturalized citizens led to the election of Democratic mayors supportive of the immigrants in 1847, 1848 and 1849. In spite of this, nativist sentiments led to another riot in 1849, in which nativist mobs attacked immigrants and their property.Primm (1998), 167. In a third riot that took place in 1852, German immigrants were accused of attacking nativist Whig Party supporters at a polling place in Soulard MarketPrimm (1998), 168.Primm (1998), 169. For its part, the Whig Party was supported with the wealthy Creoles and Irish leaders of St. Louis, and Germans had accused the Whigs of discrimination. However, the worst nativist riot in St. Louis, which took place in 1854, combined the problems of anti-immigration and the slavery issue.Primm (1998), 170. Thomas Hart Benton, who had formerly been a Missouri senator, was running for reelection as U.S. representative of Missouri's 1st congressional district. Benton was a solid member of the Democratic Party and was supported by newly naturalized and lower-class Germans and Irish. He faced Luther M. Kennett, who had garnered the support of the disintegrating Whig Party (including the wealthy St. Louis elite class) and the nativist Know Nothing movement. On August 7, 1854, election day in St. Louis, a nativist mob began attacking Democratic Irish voters and Irish property in south St. Louis. The Irish began fighting back, when the riot moved to the riverfront where dockworkers began fighting the nativist mob, which had grown in size to several thousand.Primm (1998), 171. The Irish and dockworkers retreated to boarding houses, at which point the nativists began attacking Saint Louis University and German newspaper offices. The St. Louis police department and local militia eventually quelled the riot, though not before 10 were killed, 33 wounded, and 93 buildings were damaged.Primm (1998), 172. Regulations on elections (such as closing saloons on election day) prevented fighting in future elections in 1856 and 1858. St. Louis in the American Civil War Militarily, the Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) barely touched St. Louis; the area saw only a few skirmishes in which Union forces prevailed. But the war shut down trade with the South, devastating the city's economy. Missouri was nominally a slave state, but its economy did not depend on slavery, and it never seceded from the Union. The areas of \\"Little Dixie\\" and the border with Kansas were a base for insurgency and guerrilla activity during the war. The state also had people who resisted slavery, as with the foundation of the militant Knights of Liberty in 1846. The arsenal at St. Louis was used during the war to construct ironclad ships for the Union. Notes References Further reading * Anderson, Galusha.

Designed by Edward Blore, it was built in 1841 by Manchester businessman George Holland Ackers, to replace a large timber-framed building that had been the home of the Bellot family since 1602. The house is designed in the style of a Palladian villa, except that the Great Hall is one of a number of rooms off a large central space, rather than being at the centre of the building. Great Moreton Hall is built in two storeys, interspersed with three and four- storey towers. The service wing to the left of and adjoining the main part of the building is slightly lower than the rest of the structure. The main entrance is via a broad flight of steps from a porte-coch√®re, leading to the entrance lobby and a large central hall. A triple arcade at one end of the hall leads to the main staircase, opposite a hooded fireplace decorated with the arms of the Ackers family. The Library, Drawing Room, Billiard Room, Saloon, and the Great Hall are arranged symmetrically around the central hall. \\"Dark narrow internal corridors\\" allowed the servants, whose quarters were in the cellars, to reach all the rooms without having to pass through the central hall. Great Moreton Hall was designated a Grade II* listed building on 14 February 1967. Since 1931 the house has served first as a school and then as a hotel and conference centre.

The diamond‚Äîoriginally ‚Äîis said to have been discovered in the early 19th century in India. It supposedly featured as one of the eyes in a statue of the Hindu god Brahma in Pondicherry, until it was stolen by a Jesuit cleric. According to legend, this theft caused the diamond to be cursed. In 1932, diamond dealer J. W. Paris reportedly took the diamond to the United States, and soon after committed suicide by jumping from a skyscraper in New York City. Later owners of the diamond included two Russian princesses, Leonila Galitsine-Bariatinsky and Nadia Vygin-Orlov (after whom the diamond is named). Both women allegedly jumped to their deaths in the 1940s. The diamond was later bought by Charles F. Winson, and cut into three pieces in an attempt to break the curse; the 67.5-carat Black Orlov was set into a brooch of 108 diamonds, suspended from a necklace of 124 diamonds. The diamond was purchased by diamond dealer Dennis Petimezas in 2004; Petimezas said he was \\"pretty confident that the curse is broken\\".

It lies just north of the Kabul River and is part of the city District 2. History Murad Khane was named after two Murad Khans: one the brother of a 17th-century Mughal governor and the second an 18th-century general. The area was developed in the 18th century by Ahmad Shah Durrani, the founder of the Durrani Empire. As part of this development, many ornate structures were constructed to serve as housing for members of the Qizilbash tribe. The district was laid out in a traditional Islamic pattern, around a mosque, bath-house, garden and bazaar. Soviet modernization efforts in 1975, neglect and civil war, threatened and destroyed many buildings in the area. Despite these threats, \\"Murad Khane retains much of its original fabric with a network of small streets connecting the bazaar, religious structures, caravanserai and houses in a layout that represents the area's unique ties to Islamic design and nearly four hundred years of Afghan history.\\" It is one of the few surviving historic commercial and residential neighbourhoods in Kabul. Conservation In 2006, the Turquoise Mountain Foundation began restoration work in Murad Khane, headed by Rory Stewart. By then, it had become one of the poorest areas in Kabul and in 2008 it was added to the World Monuments Fund's Watch List of the world's most endangered sites. Turquoise Mountain began to clear out the garbage that had accumulated over the years and set to work restoring the historic houses. Turquoise Mountain has now restored or rebuilt 150 damaged homes, documented built and intangible cultural heritage, opened the Institute for Afghan Arts and Architecture to train young people in traditional crafts, opened a Primary School and Family Health Clinic for the local residents, and hosted thousands of visitors to the revived neighbourhood. Turquoise Mountain's work in Murad Khane was shown as part of an exhibit, Turquoise Mountain: Artists Transforming Afghanistan, at Washington, D.C.‚Äôs Arthur M. Sackler Gallery.

OHS used the former Delivery Depot for processing and storage for 15 years, but after Pearl District property values began rising due to redevelopment that started in the late 1990s, the organization began receiving multiple offers to sell the property and ultimately accepted one. OHS sold the former Delivery Depot for $12.7 million in 2000 and moved to a new warehouse in suburban Gresham during the first half of 2001. The building then entered a long period of disuse.

Over his MLB career, DeBus, an infielder, compiled a .229 batting average with nine runs scored, 30 hits, five doubles, four triples, seven runs batted in (RBIs) and two stolen bases in 38 games played. Originally, Debus signed with the MLB St. Louis Cardinals out of the Northern League, but his contract was waived after never making an appearance. He then signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates and made his MLB debut on July 14, 1917, against the Brooklyn Robins. During his career, DeBus weighed and stood at . He batted and threw right-handed. Early life Adam Joseph DeBus, Jr. was born on October 7, 1892, in Chicago to Josephine and Adam DeBus, Sr., both of Germany. Josephine DeBus, who came to the United States in 1882, became a naturalized citizen in 1931. Adam DeBus, Sr., who came to the United States in 1878 and was naturalized in 1887, worked as a cook in Chicago. Adam Joseph DeBus, Jr. was his parent's only child. He was raised to speak German. Baseball career Bob Unglaub (pictured) served as DeBus' manager during the 1916 season. DeBus' professional baseball career began in 1914 as a member of the minor league Green Bay Bays of the Class-C Wisconsin‚ÄìIllinois League. He was under the management of Robert Lynch with the Green Bay club. Two of Debus' teammates on the Bays roster, Frank Scanlan and Joe Weiss, had experience in Major League Baseball (MLB) one time or another over their careers. On the season, DeBus compiled a .234 batting average with 91 hits, 14 doubles, three triples and three home runs in 108 games played. All of his 108 games were played at shortstop. His next professional baseball season came two seasons later in 1916 as a member of the minor league Fargo-Moorhead Graingrowers of the Class-C Northern League. The Graingrowers represented Fargo, North Dakota and Moorhead, Minnesota. Three of his teammates on the Graingrowers, Ralph Bell, Moxie Meixell and Bob Unglaub, were MLB players at one time in their careers. The Fargo-Moorhead club was managed by Bob Unglaub, who also played first base for the team. DeBus batted .284 with 96 hits in 100 games played. DeBus made his MLB debut against Brooklyn pitcher Rube Marquard (pictured) In 1917, DeBus re-signed with the Fargo-Moorhead Graingrowers. On July 2, he was sold by the Fargo-Moorhead club to the MLB St. Louis Cardinals. On July 11, DeBus was waived after never making an appearance with the club. He was then signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates and reported to the team in Brooklyn, New York. He made his MLB debut in the second game of a doubleheader on July 14, 1917, against the Brooklyn Robins at Ebbets Field. He was sixth in the Pirates batting order. In four at-bats against Brooklyn pitcher Rube Marquard, DeBus went hitless. His first MLB hit came on July 17 against Boston Braves pitcher Art Nehf. On July 20, The Pittsburgh Press wrote that DeBus was a \\"better than ordinary hitter\\" and that he could \\"field with the best of them\\". In August, it was reported that Pittsburgh manager Hugo Bezdek was pleased with the services of DeBus. The syndicated column \\"Diamond Dust\\" compared DeBus to former MLB player Art Devlin. His final MLB appearance came on September 1 against the St. Louis Cardinals. In two at-bats against St. Louis pitcher Oscar Horstmann, DeBus went hitless. On the season with the Pirates, he batted .229 with nine runs scored, 30 hits, five doubles, four triples, seven runs batted in (RBIs) and two stolen bases in 38 games played. Defensively, he played 21 games at shortstop and 18 games at third base. DeBus committed 19 errors, 92 assists and 61 putouts. He also converted 10 double plays. Despite initial success in impressing Pirates manager Hugo Bezdek, by the end of the season The Pittsburgh Press wrote that DeBus \\"[had] probably donned a Pirate uniform for the last time\\". Later life At the end of the 1917 baseball season, DeBus joined the United States Military to fight in World War I. He served with the 86th Infantry Division, and played with the division's baseball team. After his baseball career was over, he was working for an electrical company based in Chicago. By 1930, he was living with his parents in Chicago working as an electrical auto mechanic. On August 1, 1931, DeBus and his mother boarded the ocean liner in New York City to Germany. By 1942, DeBus was working for Stewart-Warner, a manufacturer of electrical automotive parts. DeBus died on May 13, 1977, in Chicago. He was buried at St. Boniface Cemetery in Chicago.

Formed in 1905, the SP&S; was commonly known as the North Bank Road (or North Bank road, \\"road\\" being short for railroad) during the period in which these buildings were in use. The Portland buildings' passenger facilities were also used by the Oregon Electric Railway after that railway was acquired by the SP&S.; Located in what is now known as the Pearl District, the buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. They were in use by the SP&S; and its successor, Burlington Northern Railroad, from 1908 until the 1980s. Only the east building was used as a passenger station, and this usage lasted from 1908 until 1931. Location The two matching, two-story brick buildings face one another on opposite sides of NW 11th Avenue immediately north of Hoyt Street, the east building being at 1029 NW Hoyt Street and the west at 1101 NW Hoyt. Historically, they were known as the East and West Freighthouses of the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway. In references to passenger services, the east building was formally referred to as the North Bank Station (or North Bank Passenger Station), but alternatively was known by various other names, including North Bank depot, Hoyt Street depot, Hoyt Street terminal, 11th & Hoyt Streets depot, 10th & Hoyt depot, or similar. Each building measures by . Background The east facade of the west building in 2011, after being converted into housing in the late 1990s. A steel awning that provided partial cover for loading docks remains in place. The SP&S; was formed jointly by the Northern Pacific Railway (NP) and Great Northern Railway in 1905, originally as the Portland & Seattle Railway, to build and ultimately operate new railroad lines connecting Portland with Seattle and with Spokane, but was renamed Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway in early 1908, before opening any track sections. The planned new railroad was commonly referred to as the \\"North Bank road\\" (road being short for railroad or railroad line), or North Bank line, because the Seattle line would follow the Columbia River's north bank as far as Kelso and the Spokane line would also follow the north bank, running east from Vancouver. East from Portland, the south bank of the Columbia already had a rail line, owned by the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company (later absorbed by Union Pacific Railroad). By September 1905, Northern Pacific had already acquired the property for the future terminal buildings and rail yard‚Äîa strip of land two blocks wide, from 10th to 12th avenues, and stretching north from Hoyt Street to the Willamette River. Construction of the railroad itself began in early 1906. The new company needed freight storage and handling facilities in Portland, and to this end it built the two \\"freight houses\\" at 11th Avenue and Hoyt Street, in 1908. SP&S; passenger train service was originally expected to terminate at Union Station, located about to the east, but lengthy negotiations between SP&S; and Union Station's operator, the Northern Pacific Terminal Company, eventually reached an impasse. The Terminal Company was only partially owned by SP&S; parent Northern Pacific Railway, and partially by competing railroads. With only a few weeks to go until passenger service to Portland was to be started, it was reported that SP&S; would instead equip one of its new freight houses for use as a passenger station, in place of access to Union Station, at least temporarily. Period of active use The west building in 2011 Passenger trains began using the new station‚Äîthe east building, at 1029 NW Hoyt Street‚Äîin November 1908. The west building, used exclusively for freight, came into use at the same time, as SP&S; initiated its operations in Portland. Trains operating from this station served routes within the Pacific Northwest, including to Seattle, Spokane and Seaside via Astoria. The Portland‚ÄìSpokane train, named the Inland Empire Express, connected in Spokane with Great Northern's Oriental Limited to and from Chicago Note: Advertisement. and was advertised as the \\"Portland‚ÄìChicago\\" service. SP&S; began shifting some of its passenger trains to Union Station in 1920, and additional trains were shifted in 1922, after new platforms and train sheds were constructed at Union Station for that purpose. However, only some trains used Union Station, including the long-distance services to Chicago (which began carrying through sleeping cars, Portland‚ÄìChicago, at this time), while other trains continued to use the Hoyt Street station for a time. Note: Advertisement. SP&S; inaugurated passenger service between Portland and Vernonia in March 1923, with two round trips per day; a passenger-only train ran to and from Union Station, but a mixed freight-passenger train operated instead from the Hoyt Street station. The south ends of the two matching buildings In 1912, Oregon Electric Railway (OE) interurban passenger trains began serving the North Bank Depot, after that company laid new track through downtown Portland along Salmon Street and 10th Avenue to reach the terminal. OE was owned by SP&S; (acquired in 1910). Electric interurbans departed from this station on journeys west to Hillsboro and Forest Grove, and south through the Willamette Valley to Salem and Eugene. The last OE service to this station operated on June 19, 1931, after the company requested, and received, permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon that section of route because of declining ridership and worsening traffic congestion. The service was cut back to Front and Jefferson streets the following day, and OE moved its ticket office to that location. The tracks along 10th and Salmon streets were abandoned and soon removed. Just two years later, in May 1933, the Oregon Electric discontinued all its remaining passenger service, becoming exclusively a freight railroad. SP&S; was merged with other railroads in 1970 to form Burlington Northern Railroad (BN). The former North Bank Depot Buildings continued to be used by the railroad for freight purposes until the 1980s, and then were vacant for a time, until at least the mid-1990s. Preservation and conversion During the course of the 1980s, usage of the railroad yards adjacent to and north of the two now-Burlington Northern-owned warehouses declined to the point of their being nearly vacant. Redevelopment of the area as a mixed-use neighborhood with residential and retail uses was envisioned, and in 1989, the Portland Planning Commission approved a rezoning of a tract, along with a master plan to foster such change. By then, the Glacier Park Company, a property-development subsidiary of Burlington Resources, had taken over the former North Bank Depot Buildings from BN, and it was reported that the new master plan for the area would include renovation of these two Hoyt Street warehouses. In November 1990, Glacier Park sold the 40-acre site to a Portland-based development company, Prendergast & Associates. It was determined that extensive clean-up of contaminated soil from decades of industrial use would be needed before most redevelopment could proceed. Prendergast & Associates were predicting an approximately 20-year timeframe for redevelopment of the entire area of former railyards and associated buildings. The two former-SP&S; freighthouses were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996, as the North Bank Depot Buildings. At that time, they were vacant and had not yet been renovated. In the late 1990s, they were renovated and converted for residential use.

She is currently financial markets director at the Initiative for Policy Dialogue,Initiative for Policy Dialogue website based at Columbia University in New York and associate fellow at the Overseas Development Institute. Previously she was professorial fellow at the Institute of Development Studies at Sussex University. She has held the position of deputy director of International Finance at the Commonwealth Secretariat and has worked at the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and in the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. She started her career in 1970 at the Central Bank of Chile. Before joining the Institute of Development Studies, she worked at Barclays Bank International in the UK. She has acted as senior consultant to governments in Eastern Europe and Latin America and to many international agencies, including the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the European Commission, UNICEF, UNDP and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. She was also a member of the Warwick Commission on international financial reform.Warwick Commission bio She has published over 20 books and written many scholarly and journalistic articles. Her latest book, edited jointly with Jos√© Antonio Ocampo and Joseph Stiglitz, Time for the Visible Hand, Lessons from the 2008 crisis, was published in 2010. Contributions to economic analysis and policy Griffith-Jones has contributed to research and policy suggestions on how to make the domestic and international financial system more stable so it can better serve the needs of inclusive economic development and the real economy. One of her first articles, The Growth of Multinational Banking, the Euro-currency market and their effects on developing countries in the Journal of Development Studies, published in 1980, warned of the risk of excessive international bank lending to developing economies. Her 1986 book with Osvaldo Sunkel, Debt and Development Crises in Latin America: The End of An Illusion, showed the negative effects of the 1980s Latin American debt crisis on the region's economic development.Debt and Development Crises in Latin America: The End of An Illusion, with Osvaldo Sunkel, Oxford University Press, 1986 She was an early advocate of debt relief in Latin America and Sub-saharan Africa. Writing with Ricardo Ffrench-Davis in the 1990s she contributed to the debate on how Latin America could curb and manage volatile capital flows.Coping With Capital Surges: The Return of Finance to Latin America, edited with Ricardo Ffrench-Davis, Lynne Rienner, 1995 She again warned of the risks of costly financial crises if sufficient measures such as capital controls were not implemented. After several financial crises, mainly in developing countries, she started in the mid-1990s to advocate capital flow regulations in capital source countries as a way to curb excessive and volatile capital flows.How Can Future Currency Crises Be Prevented or Better Managed?, in Teunissen, Jan Joost, Can Currency Crises Be Prevented or Better Managed? Lessons from Mexico, FONDAD, 1996 She believed this would reduce the risk of major reversals of capital flows and the financial crises that result from them. This is further discussed in her 1998 book Global Capital Flows, should they be regulated?Global Capital Flows, should they be regulated? with preface by Nobel prize winner James Tobin, Macmillan and St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 1998 In the discussion on reform of the international financial architecture she contributed to the analysis of crisis prevention, especially through financial regulation and more effective financial crisis management. For example, she advocated special drawing rights issues by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a means to provide official liquidity when private capital flows fall sharply. She also advocated expanded and less conditional IMF lending so countries do not have to unnecessarily adjust their economies, especially in the face of financial crises or other external shocks. Writing with Jos√© Antonio Ocampo since the late 1990sWhat Progress on International Financial Reform? Why so Limited? - written with Jos√© Antonio Ocampo and Jacques Cailloux, EGDI, 1999 they expanded the concept of counter-cyclical reform of the international financial system to help stabilise capital flows and domestic private lending. The aim was to avoid frequent costly crises, facilitate macro-economic management and to achieve stable and inclusive economic growth in developing countries. She has worked on practical policy applications of these ideas. She has advocated reform of compensatory financing at the IMF in the face of external shocks to make it larger, speedier and with less conditionality. Similarly she was an early supporter of expanding development banks - nationally, regionally and multilaterally - and their role in counter-cyclical lending. She has also advocated the issue of GDP-linked bonds as a counter-cyclical mechanism to reduce the risk of financial crises.\\"A bond that insures against instability\\", with Robert J. Shiller, The Financial Times, July 10, 2006 She has long supported the idea of counter-cyclical regulation. These and other practical measures are aimed at reforming the financial system so that it supports stable inclusive economic growth without costly financial crises.

Design and development The F.1 was designed as a fighter for the Royal Flying Corps and it was a large tractor biplane powered by a Rolls-Royce Mk III piston engine. It had two tandem open cockpits with unusually the observer forward and the pilot behind. A rectangular aperture was cut-out of the upper wing above the observer's cockpit which would allow the observer to use a gun.Bruce 1965, pp. 154, 156. It was tested at Martlesham Heath in July 1917, where it demonstrated good handling but was criticised for the awkward crew arrangement.

He was selected by the Buffalo Sabres in the 5th round (145th overall) of the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. Valent played for BK Mlad√° Boleslav from the 2010‚Äì11 Czech Extraliga season until October 2014. He had previously played for HC Sparta Prague. Career After joining Mlad√° Boleslav he spent much of the first two seasons as back-up to local born goalie Marek Schwarz. Schwarz then left the club and Jaroslav H√ºbl came in to take his place. Valent, therefore, remained second choice for the majority of the 2010‚Äì11 season. At the end of that season the club was relegated to the Czech Prvn√≠ Liga, the second highest Czech league, in 2012 he remained with the club and was initially set to form a partnership with new signing Vlastimil Lakosil,http://www.bkboleslav.cz/clanek.asp?id=Brankarska-dvojice-pro- nadchazejici-sezonu-Vlastimil-Lakosil-a-Michal-Valent-2882 (in Czech) but junior goaltender Roman Will was given a place in the team when he unexpectedly returned from Canada, leaving Valent's position uncertain. For that reason he was loaned out to other teams including HK Nitra in his native Slovakia.http://www.bkboleslav.cz/clanek.asp?id=Michal-Valent-bude-hostovat-v- Nitre-3013 (in Czech) Lakosil failed to impress, but youngster Will proved extremely capable and secured the number one spot. When Will was unable to play due to illness, Valent was recalled from Nitra early.http://www.bkboleslav.cz/clanek.asp?id=3162 (in Czech) He subsequently built a solid position in the club and the Will-Valent partnership excelled. Lakosil would eventually leave the club to play in Kazakhstan.http://www.bkboleslav.cz/clanek.asp?id=3178 (in Czech) By the time the club won promotion back into the Extraliga at the end of the 2013-14 season, Valent had cemented his place as the team's first choice goaltender and signed a contract with the club for the following season. With Will heading to the US at the beginning of the 2014-15 season however, newcomer David Rittich was handed the reigns as the team's number one goal tender leaving Valent once again as back-up. He made two starts earning an 0-1-1 record,http://www.bkboleslav.cz/zapas.asp?id=Boleslav-znovu-nezvladla- koncovku-Hradec-dokonal-obrat-v-prodlouzeni-3105 (in Czech)http://www.bkboleslav.cz/zapas.asp?ID=Slavia-vyucovala-Bruslare-z- produktivity-3106 (in Czech) as well as twice coming in to replace Rittich part way through a game in the first 12 games of the season. In early October the club signed veteran goalie Roman M√°lek on loan from HC V√≠tkovice Steel on loan until the end of the season,http://www.bkboleslav.cz/clanek.asp?id=4136 (in Czech) leading to speculation that there may have been some tension between Valent and Rittich, or that Valent was clearly unhappy as number two behind the rookie, though there has not been any clear evidence of this. M√°lek's arrival, however, further complicated the goal-tending situation and it was unlikely that the three could all get a chance to play. Finally, on October 16, 2014 it was announced that Valent would shortly be leaving the club http://www.bkboleslav.cz/clanek.asp?id=Michal-Valent-a-David-Kveton- odchazeji-z-Mlade-Boleslavi-4159 (in Czech) and returning to his native Slovakia to join HK Nitra, one of the clubs he represented while on loan from Mlad√° Boleslav in the 2012-13 season.http://hknitra.tipsportextraliga.sk/novinky/aktualne-v-klube/michal- valent-opaet-oblecie-dres-hk-nitra.html (in Slovak) In the 2014‚Äì15 season Nitra reached the play-off semi-finals and during the off-season Valent signed a contract to remain at the club for another season. On December 19, 2015, Valent made his debut for the Slovakian national team at the Arosa Challenge in Switzerland. Facing the home team, Slovakia eventually succumbed by a score of 3-2 after a shootout. On April 22, 2016, Valent's current team HK Nitra became champion of the Slovak Extraliga, beating Bansk√° Bystrica in 6 games.

In the same year he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn. He was a pupil of Mr. Duval, an eminent conveyancer. He acquired a high reputation as an equity draftsman and conveyancer, and, though he never took silk, had for nearly half a century an extensive practice at the junior bar. He was one of the commissioners appointed to reform the procedure of the Court of Chancery in 1853, his large experience of chancery business rendering his suggestions of the highest value in the work of framing the rules of practice issued under the Chancery Amendment Acts. In the chancery proceedings by which, in 1867, the celebrated Orton or Castro first sought to establish his claim to the Tichborne baronetcy and estates, Barber held a brief for the defendants, as he did again in the first of the two actions of ejectment which were subsequently brought in the court of common pleas for the same purpose, in the well-known case of Tichborne v. Lushington, decided in 1872 after a trial which lasted 103 days. He also acted as one of the counsel for the crown in the prosecution for perjury which followed, and which occupied in the hearing from first to last 188 days. In 1874 he was appointed judge of county courts for circuit No. 6 (Hull and the East Riding), but resigned the post almost immediately, and resumed practice at the bar.

FLEC aims at the restoration of the self-proclaimed Republic of Cabinda, located within the borders of the Cabinda province of Angola. Background The area of modern-day Cabinda was first explored by navigator Diogo C√£o in 1483, later falling under Portuguese influence. In 1853 a delegation of Cabindan chiefs unsuccessfully requested the extension of Portuguese administration from the colony of Angola to Cabinda. Local chiefs continued their attempts at cooperating with Portugal until the 1884 Berlin Conference and the 1885 Treaty of Simulambuco, following which the Cabindan enclave became a Portuguese protectorate. Despite the fact that Cabinda held a semi independent status, a new Portuguese government elected in 1956 transferred the region's administration to Angolan without a prior agreement with Cabinda's local leadership. The first Cabindan separatist movement known as Associa√ß√£o dos Ind√≠genas do Enclave de Cabinda (AlEC) was formed in 1956, AIEC advocated the creation of a union between Cabinda and Belgian Congo or French Congo. Associa√ß√£o dos Ressortissants do Enclave de Cabinda (AREC) was founded in 1959 as humanitarian organisation, AREC was renamed into Freedom Movement for the State of Cabinda (MLEC), shifting its role into a political movement promoting self-determination. The National Action Committee of the Cabindan People (CAUNC) and the Mayomb√© Alliance (ALLIAMA) joined the growing political scene in the same year. In 1963, MLEC, ALLIAMA and CAUNC merged into the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC), which had since been the largest self-determination movement in the region. On the same year, the Organisation of African Unity declared that Cabinda is an independently governed state with its own independence movement. On 10 January 1967, FLEC formed a government in exile based in the town of Tshela, Zaire. In August 1974, FLEC absorbed the Democratic Union of Cabindan Peoples and the Democratic Party of Cabinda, becoming the sole political organisation in Cabinda. In January 1975 under pressure from Angolan liberation movements, Portugal accepted Cabinda as part of Angola in the Alvor Agreement where the 3 Angolan independence movements (MPLA, UNITA and FNLA) were present, denying Cabinda the right to self-determination previously granted by the U.N. Chart/Right to Self-determination and the Treaty of Simulambuco. On 1 August 1975, FLEC president Luis Ranque Franque announced the formation of the Republic of Cabinda, an independent state. The MPLA troops controlling the region at the time ignored the statement. In November 1975, Angola gained independence from Portugal, claiming Cabinda as part of its territory. The provisional Cabindan government, led by the FLEC, was overturned. On 8 November 1975, FLEC responded by initiating armed struggle, aiming at creating a separate Cabindan state. Conflict In the course of the Angolan Civil War, FLEC split into five independent factions. FLEC-Posi√ß√£o Militar (FLEC-PM) was later renamed into FLEC-Renovada (FLEC-R), FLEC-N'Zita, FLEC-Lubota, Uni√£o Nacional de Liberta√ß√£o de Cabinda (UNLC) and the Communist Committee of Cabinda. As the war continued the MPLA led government attempted to gain the support of the various FLEC factions and enter negotiations. On the other hand, UNITA rebels directly collaborated with FLEC-FAC, while seeking to broaden its alliance with the group. The above did not stop UNITA from occasionally collaborating with MPLA in anti-FLEC operations. In 2002, the Angolan government signed a peace deal with UNITA officially ending the civil war. Cuba, East Germany and the Soviet Union entered the civil war on MPLA's side in 1975, soon invading Cabinda. According to U.S. intelligence services, France and Belgium allegedly supported FLEC by providing training and financial aid, despite the fact that Zaire remained FLEC's main foreign supporter. FLEC-Renovada received support from a number of US, South African and Japanese right wing organisations as well as the World League for Freedom and Democracy. In 1956, oil was first discovered in the region; by 1966, Gulf Oil Company began commercial exploitation. The large amounts of revenue generated by oil royalties contributed to the rise of Cabinda's geopolitical significance. By 1970, oil revenues amounted to $16 million and were expected to rise to $32‚Äì50 million by 1972. Oil continued to play an important role; by 2011 it represented approximately 86% of the Angolan state‚Äôs total earnings. The marginalisation of the local population in favor of Portuguese and later Angolan interests played an important role in the rise of separatist militancy in the region. On 18 July 2006, the Cabinda Forum for Dialogue (FCD) and FLEC- Renovada led by Ant√≥nio Bento Bembe signed a second definite cease fire with the Angolan government known as the Memorandum of Understanding for Peace in Cabinda. The event took place in Macabi, Cabinda. The agreement assured Cabinda's status as a part of Angola, provided special economic status and local governance powers to Cabinda, and condemned further acts of insurgency and separatism. The treaty received criticism from Bembe's opponents within the movement. The peace accord marked a sharp decrease in the conflict's intensity. According to the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, Cabinda is under military occupation,UNPO Resolution Concerning the Cabinda Enclave Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, July 7, 2005 reinforced in recent times by Angolan forces. This was especially true after the Togo national football team was attacked by the FLEC, when Angola was hosting the 2010 African Cup of Nations. Rebel forces claimed it was a mistake. In 2012, FLEC-FAC announced its readiness to declare a ceasefire and pursue a negotiated resolution to the conflict.AfricaReview ‚Äì Angola's Cabinda rebels to 'lay down arms', May 2, 2013. Retrieved January 5, 2015. International intervention in the conflict has been limited, with Portugal offering a mediation role and letting the FLEC rule a delegation in Lisbon.

The arrested included six members of the Angolan military who were charged with desertion and carrying out armed attacks, as well as a former Voice of America journalist, known for his criticism of the government. The detainees were denied contact with legal professionals or their families for prolonged periods of time. The above are considered to be a violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. A Bertelsmann Stiftung investigation covering the period between 2011 and 2013, indicated that systematic human rights violations have taken place, with journalists, civil rights activists and clergy members receiving harassment after being accused of supporting FLEC. Reports by Freedom House, Bertelsmann Stiftung and Human Rights Watch also pointed out at violations committed by FLEC.

Career =Amateur career= Ruijgh was born in Heerlen, and liked to watch cycling on television as a youth. After visiting the local velodrome in Geleen, he started racing at the age of 9. In 1998, he became Dutch Youth Champion for 12-year-olds in Oldenzaal. With continued good results, he came into the picture of the former Dutch national coach Egon van Kessel. As he became older, van Kessel invited Ruijgh to compete against foreign opponents of his age, which are also among the best in their country. Ruijgh did not disappoint, winning the highly regarded World Cup Giro della Lunigiana in 2004. Shortly after that he also rode the Men's Junior World Championships in Verona, Italy. In 2005, Ruijgh rode for Belgian team Amuzza.com, where former top sprinter Wilfried Nelissen was his team leader. He won one race during the season, before joining the in 2006. Due to a virus, he could not keep up his good results, which took him out for a few months. In 2008 Ruijgh joined the German Team Sparkasse; hestarted to perform well again and rode for the Dutch national team at under-23 level. In 2009 he continued his good results at Team BPL‚ÄìBelisol, where he won Roms√©e‚ÄìStavelot‚ÄìRoms√©e and the 1st stage of the Tour de Li√®ge. Thereafter, team manager Daan Luijkx from the offered him an internship in mid-2009.

On 21 July 1826 he was indicted for publishing in the 'Northern Whig' a libel tending to bring into disrepute the character of a certain 'improving' landlord. The libel consisted in a letter purporting to be by a small farmer in which the improvements alleged to have been effected by the landlord in question were denied to be improvements at all, and in which a character for litigiousness was imputed to the landlord. Finlay was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, without the option of a fine, and the publication of the 'Northern Whig' was suspended from August 1826 until May 1827. From the first Finlay advocated the emancipation of the Roman Catholics, and it was in the columns of the 'Northern Whig' that William Sharman Crawford propounded his celebrated views on tenant-right. Some comments in the 'Northern Whig' on the conduct of Lord Hertford's agent led to another prosecution for libel in 1830, which, however, was abandoned when it transpired that Daniel O'Connell had volunteered for the defence. On a similar charge he was found guilty on 23 July 1832 and sentenced to three months' imprisonment and fined 50l. In spite, however, of these proceedings, the 'Northern Whig' continued from time to time to give expression to similar views which were adjudged libellous and occasioned its proprietor very heavy legal expenditure. To the extension of the suffrage, the disestablishment of the Irish church, and the reform of the land laws Finlay through his paper gave a steady and zealous support ; but, though a personal friend of O'Connell, he opposed the movement for the repeal of the union and the later developments of Irish disaffection, such as the Young Irelandism of Mitchell and the agitation which resulted in the abortive insurrection of Smith O'Brien. The Finlay family entertained the famous author Mark Twain when he visited Ulster. Death He died on 10 Sept. 1857, bequeathing his paper to his younger son, Francis Dalzell Finlay,Charles Dickens Belfast Ulster Scots Academy. by whom it was conducted until 1874, when it was transferred to a limited company. Finlay married in 1830 Marianne, daughter of the Rev. William Porter, presbyterian minister, of Newtonlimavady, County Londonderry, his elder son was named William Porter Finlay. Finlay is buried in Clifton Street Cemetery, Belfast.

It is heavily influenced by American hip hop, and started in late 1990. In recent years, Bangladeshi hip hop artists have begun to emerge in underground scenes in large cities such as Dhaka, Khulna Comilla, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The lyrical expression of cultural identity, with lyrics addressing Bangladesh's political and social problems, make this genre a popular and growing one. Jalali set Ifug Damn Yeasin Noman Shuvo History Hip Hop first took root in Bangladesh during the late 1990s at the Sheikh Kamal Complex in Dhaka which houses the Bangladesh Basketball Federation, part of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Basketball Amateur (FIBA). Basketball players and Hip hop heads from St Francis Xavier's Green Herald International School were drawn to this space which housed the country's first and only wooden floor basketball gymnasium at the time. This group of youth from SFX were brought together by their love for the game where they continued on to play for 1st Division League Teams in the country such as the Dhaka Gladiators, Dhumketu Club, Eagles Club, Rangers Club, Lal Bagh and The Gregs Club. Two particular returning international students, G.A.K returning from Dallas, TX, Richland College, and currently an XO affiliate and R.A. (currently residing in Tokyo, Japan) returning from Sydney, Australia influenced the scene along with other locals from Greenherald school. Like any hip hop head, the groups love for sneakers was deep. They were rocking Nike Air Max, Air Jordan's, Air Force 1s, Flights, Adidas shell toes and Puma kicks back then. Their hiphop music influences were the likes of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., 2 Live Crew NWA, Cypress Hill, House of Pain and the Wu-Tang Clan. While the culture took root in this limited space it was further propelled by the introduction of American television and distribution of Hip Hop music within cd shops. In early 2000, online social networking such as Facebook and Myspace also played a heavy role in bringing together various underground Bangladeshi rappers together in sharing their music. Early hip-hop was not led by corporate interests, but rather was largely ignored by major record companies. An important spark for Bangladeshi hip-hop music scene occurred in 2005, when Stoic Bliss released their debut album 'Alok Borso durey'. Then Deshi MC's introduced gangsta rap. Until early 2009 there were some good few awesome Bangla Hip Hop Music in the market but the only thing was still missing back then a proper hip hop music video which was fulfilled by Yousuf Mony who released his Moja titled music video in May 2009 from Ireland under Sangeeta Music. Now there are many rappers and hip-hop crews out there in Bangladesh and outside the country. =Dhaka= Dhaka is the birthplace and hub of Bangladeshi Hip-Hop. Almost all mainstream rappers and hip-hop crews are from Dhaka City. Dhaka hip hop artists include Deshi Mc's,Black Zang, Taura Safa,Shib-B ShihaB,D.33,CDL,APD,Tri-Gang, Rajotto, Rap Hood Goonstaz, East Side Souljaz, Jalali Set, Krazy Noize, The Elite, R.I.S, Lyrical Assassins, Stunnerz, Cataclysm, Fat Kabs, Official KGS, Twin-B,Poetic Syndicate, D-Briggaz, GSR, Fly-O-Logy, Street Kings, and Abir Mollaand. =Khulna= Khulna is the beautiful city in Bangladesh. 5 Best Rapper Representing His Country 1Noman Shuvo ( He is The Most Talented Rapper Bron 2002 February 25 Khulna His Best songs, Noman Gang, Realty, MitthaHasi,Cute Nari,sopnerBalucor =Sylhet= The Sylhet Hip Hop scene is very different from others in Bangladesh.

Then Lal Miah brought Sylheti hip-hop to Bangla Hip-hop largely. Sylhet Hip-Hop artist includes Lal Miah, Badboys Crew, Rhyme Shooterz. =Chittagong= Chittagong Hip Hop artists includes Sinister, R.O.C [Rapperz Of Ctg], Hustlerz Hood, Duke Of Chittagong, High Rollers, Chainlezz Fellaz. =Artists outside Bangladesh Noman Shuvo is The Best Rapper/HipHoper in Khulna city YouTube Channel Name Noman Shuvo official He representing Bangladesh =Elsewhere= There are many crews in Savar, Comilla, Narayangong, and Cox's Bazar. The style of music, lyrics and culture associated with hip-hop wasn't something one would consider compatible with the social norms of Bangladesh. But before long, artists such as Stoic Bliss and Deshi MCs emerged and started producing rap music in Bangla, which quickly became popular among the youth. Fast forward to 2018, although the tag of being an underground scene remains, hip-hop has garnered widespread recognition. A quick search on YouTube will provide a large list of practicing rappers, b-boys and beatboxers. Various events now regularly host hip-hop artists, some have even made it to the mainstream media. But Bangladeshi Hip Hop culture is misunderstood in the country and lags behind the scenes elsewhere in the world. In 2019 Tabib Mahmud came to limelight with the song \\"Dhakaiya Guli Boy\\" which left behind many tracks in Bangladeshi Hip Hop scene regarding popularity.

In his early career he won a series of cross country races in Europe (taking the first IAAF World Cross Challenge title) and twice represented Kenya at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships. He also ran the 5000 metres on the track, competing at the World Championships in Athletics and winning a bronze medal at the 1991 All-Africa Games. He won the San Silvestre Vallecana 10 km road race three times during this period. A serious car accident in 1995 left him unable to compete for two years, but he returned to action with a world record for the run in late 1997. On his debut over the distance, he won the 1998 Chicago Marathon with a time of 2:06:54 hours, which ranked him as the third fastest ever at that point and was the fastest ever debut run for the marathon. He was third in Chicago in 1999 and came fourth at the 2000 Boston Marathon. He was picked for the Kenyan Olympic team at the 2000 Sydney Games, but was shot in the neck during a carjacking in Kenya a month before the competition. He began running again in 2001, but the kidnapping of his son and a bout of malaria reduced his competitive appearances. Although nerve damage from the shooting meant he ran with a constant lean to the right, he placed third at the 2002 Honolulu Marathon and won the San Diego Marathon in 2003.

Early settlements The earliest settlements in the St. Louis area were built by the people of the Mississippian culture, who constructed more than two dozen burial mounds within what would become the city of St. Louis.Primm (1998), 1. The earliest mounds in the area date to approximately 1050, but much about the mound builders in St. Louis is unknown. Although some of the St. Louis area settlement is preserved at the Cahokia Mounds site in Illinois, the mounds in St. Louis were nearly all demolished.Hodges (Jan. 2011) Only one mound remains within the city (Sugarloaf Mound), although St. Louis retained the nickname \\"The Mound City\\" well into the 19th century. One of the primary causes of settlement for indigenous peoples was the presence of the Mississippi River and its tributaries, especially the Missouri River.Norris (1997), 74. Native Americans used the large forests located along the river to construct canoes, which were then used for transport on the rivers.Norris (1997), 75. After the end of the Mississippian culture in the 14th century and due to pressures from French Canadian settlers, Siouan- speaking groups such as the Missouri and Osage migrated to the Missouri valley, living in villages along the Osage and Missouri rivers. Both groups lived in conflict with northeastern tribes such as the Sauk and Fox, and all four groups confronted the earliest explorers of Missouri. European exploration of the Mississippi valley European exploration of the area began nearly a century before the city of St. Louis was officially founded. In the early 1670s, Jean Talon, the Intendant of New France, ordered an exploration of the potential of the Mississippi River after hearing of rumors that it connected to the Pacific Ocean.Primm (1998), 2. On this mission, explorer Louis Joliet and Jesuit priest Jacques Marquette arrived at the Mississippi River in June 1673 and traveled past the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi to the mouth of the Arkansas River.Primm (1998), 3. At this point Joliet returned north after determining the river would not reach the Pacific and fearing attack by Spanish settlers. Nine years later, French explorer La Salle led an expedition south from the Illinois river to the mouth of the Mississippi and claimed the entire valley for France. La Salle named the Mississippi river basin Louisiana after King Louis XIV; the region between and near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi was named Illinois Country. As part of a series of forts in the Mississippi valley, in 1699 the French built a settlement on the east bank of the Mississippi at Cahokia, Illinois, near the Cahokia Mounds complex. The next year, the Kaskaskia tribe established a village at a small river within the present area of St. Louis. With them two Jesuit priests, Pierre-Gabriel Marest and Francois Pinet, built a small mission at the site, naming the river the River Des Peres (River of the Fathers). However, by 1703 the site was abandoned as the Kaskaskia moved to the east bank and further south to a new settlement named Kaskaskia, Illinois. French settlements and forts in the Illinois Country in 1763 with current U.S. state boundaries for reference French settlements and the Seven Years' War Organized development of the Mississippi valley began with a grant of a trade monopoly in 1712 to Antoine Crozat, with the goal of finding and mining precious stones, gold and silver.Primm (1998), 4. However, Crozat's venture failed by 1717 due to Spanish interference, and he relinquished his charter. The next company to be granted a trade monopoly for the region was led by John Law, a Scottish financier. In 1717, Law convinced Louis XIV to provide the Company of the West a 25-year monopoly of trade and ownership of all mines, while promising to settle 6,000 whites and 3,000 black slaves and build churches throughout the region. The company founded New Orleans as the capital of Louisiana in 1718, and merged with other companies in 1719 to form the Company of the Indies. In spite of a financial crisis and the ouster of Law in 1720, the Company of the Indies established a capital of the Illinois Country (upper Louisiana) at Fort de Chartres, 15 miles north of Kaskaskia on the east bank of the Mississippi.Primm (1998), 5. Another early settlement near present-day St. Louis, Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, was built in 1732 across from the Kaskaskia village as a convenient port for salt and ore mined on the western side of the Mississippi. Although the Company of the Indies began making trade ties with Missouri River tribes in the early 1720s and 1730s, French economic policy focused on trade with the Spanish colony of New Mexico to the southwest.Primm (1998), 6. Several trade expeditions between New Mexico and the Mississippi valley occurred between 1739 and the Seven Years' War of 1756‚Äì1763. However, the war had destroyed the wealth of many French trading firms and merchants based in New Orleans, and the French governor of Louisiana began granting trade monopolies in several areas at the conclusion of the war to stimulate growth.Primm (1998), 8.

Biography  Yisraeli was born in 1927 in the town of Motal in Belarus (then part of Poland). He was named after his uncle Rabbi Meir Haim Dolenko (1882‚Äì1917), the rabbi of Motal (who died in his prime during the First World War from typhus). Following the Soviet annexation of Eastern Poland, Yisraeli's family was exiled to Kazakhstan and, as a result, his family avoided the fate of the majority of the Jewish residents of the town whom were murdered by the Nazis during World War II. Following the war, the family received permission to move to Poland and, soon afterwards, they contacted the Berihah network. They subsequently reached a transit camp in Germany, where Yisraeli met his future wife, Sarah. From the transit camp, the family managed to flee to Mandate Palestine. After Yisraeli arrived in Palestine, which was later to become the State of Israel, he was not drafted to the IDF for health reasons. As a result, he was initially assigned to work temporarily in the archive of the Prime Minister's Office. He later managed to convince the doctors in the IDF recruiting office to enlist him, and, in 1950, he was sent to work, as part of his military service, in the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Yisraeli became a close aide of Nehemia Argov, the military Adjutant of the Defense Minister and first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, and, during his career, he worked in the service of 14 defense ministers. Yisraeli's autobiography was published in 2005.

Career Tillmann Uhrmacher started his career as a light jockey in a well- known little club, worked in a record shop and went on to become an internationally renowned DJ. Musical recognition was first achieved when Uhrmacher was one of the founding members of the electronic group Mysterious Art, along with members Michael Krautter, Mike Staab, Nicole Boe√∫f and Stephanie Trautmann. In 1988, the band's first single \\"DasOmen\\" became a number one hit in Germany, selling over 400,000 copies. It spent 29weeks in the German charts and was the second most successful single of the year. This was followed by a second single \\"\\", which also reached the top 10. In 1990, the band supported Madonna's Blond Ambition World Tour. In June 1990, Uhrmacher began his own radio-show broadcast every Saturday evening on RPR1. Later, this show was broadcast on sunshine live. This ran from its inception in 1990 until 18 March 2011 and is the longest-running electronic music show on German radio. In 1994, he entered into the Guinness Book of Records for an 80-hour non-stop broadcast. In addition, Tillmann Uhrmacher also produced a compilation series called Maximal in the mix. The last issue appeared in April 2009, after the tenth edition. Uhrmacher published his first solo single \\"Bassfly\\" in 1999. In 2001, the single \\"On the Run\\" did well on the UK club charts and attained number 16 in the UK singles charts. A collaboration with Mauro Picotto under the pseudonym of Lava brought about two singles Autumn and Spring Time. Between 2000 and 2002, he presented the Tillmann Uhrmacher Show on Hitradio RPR1. He was chosen to be a judge for the German Dance Awards in Hamburg, and also became the stadium speaker of the 1. FC Kaiserslautern Bundesliga football outfit. Tillmann Uhrmacher also appeared at both small and large festivals in the field of electronic music. Since 1999, he had appeared at least once every year on one of the main stages at Nature One and additional performances on smaller stages. In addition, he hosted the live coverage of the Nature One on Sunshine Live. An appearance had been planned for Nature One 2011.

In its simplest forms, it can be described by the concept of see and avoid,See and Avoid, Skybrary in the case of human-piloted aircraft, or sense and avoid,Rosenkrans, W. \\"Detect, Sense and Avoid\\". FlightTech, pp. 24-29, July 2008. in the case of non-human piloted aircraft (such as UAVs). However, because of several factors such as weather, instrument flight rules and air traffic complexity, the self-separation capability involves other elements and aspects such as rules of the air,Rules of the Air, Annex 2 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, ICAO. communication technologies and protocols, air traffic management and others.  Context and historical background  Pilots of modern aircraft cannot rely only on visual abilities and piloting skills to maintain acceptably safe separation from other aircraft, thus a considerable proportion of contemporary flights are performed under instrument flight rules with the responsibility for separation belonging to air traffic control (ATC). However, as the air traffic growth in the end of the 20th century and in the beginning of the 21stEUROCONTROL Long-Term Forecast Flight Movements 2010 - 2030The world of Civil Aviation 2003-2006. ICAO Circular 307 AT/129, 2005Air Transport, Air traffic growth trends and forecasts. UNESCAP FAA Aerospace Forecast Fiscal Years 2010-2030 is straining the ATC capacity, researchers on aviation and air transport are trying to propose operational and technological improvements in order to cope with this strain, one of which is self-separation. Self-separation started being considered as a potentially feasible operational concept within the Free Flight initiative.RTCA Task Force 3 Final Report on Free Flight Implementation. October, 1995 Its key technological enabler is automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), in which aircraft spontaneously transmit periodic position and state reports, including absolute horizontal position information, which is not used as information source for the pre- existing Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). In relation to the current implementations of TCAS, which is intended only for collision avoidance, self- separation requires a leap in processing logic, time anticipation and procedure changes. Its feasibility is dependent on confidence in automation and its co-existence with the human role in the cockpit. Some studies have been conducted to assess this relationship, and the results show that the concept is well acceptable from the pilot point of view without imposing unreasonable workload. An aligned but less radical and more implementable approach was later proposed and named as Distributed Air-Ground Traffic Management (DAG-TM),NASA, Concept definition for distributed air-/ground traffic management (DAG-TM), Version 1.0, Advanced Air Transportation Technologies project, Aviation System Capacity Program, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, 1999 keeping ATC still with a significant role, but allowing more freedom in en-route airspace.NASA. DAG-TM Concept element 5 en-route free maneuvering for user-preferred separation assurance and local TFM conformance operational concept description, AATT Project Milestone 8.503.10, NASA Airspace Systems Program Office, Washington D.C., 2004. Besides, other relevant aspects in a wider context have been studied in the Mediterranean Free Flight projecthttp://www.eurocontrol.int/eec/public/standard_page/proj_MFF.htmlhttp://www.medff.it (MFF) which had, as one of the main conclusions, that self-separation would be overall beneficial, but it should have to be limited to low- or medium-density airspace.http://www.asas-tn.org/workshops/2nd-asas- tn2-workshop/session-3-b/1_MFFresults.ppt Since the beginning of the association between self-separation and ADS-B, it has been also associated with another technical concept called Airborne Separation Assistance Systemhttp://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Airborne_Separation_Assurance_Systems_%28ASAS%29(ASAS) which, in short words, performs the core logic of Self-separation and other related applications. With this association, the concept of aircraft Self- separation in the full technological and operational context is more clearly distinguishable from the already cited see and avoid and sense and avoid basic concepts. ASAS was an assumption in the MFF project and also in subsequent studies such as the series from Consiglio et al.,M. Consiglio, S. Hoadley, D. Wing and B. Baxley, Safety Performance of Airborne Separation: Preliminary Baseline Testing, Proc. 7th AIAA ATIO Conf., Belfast, Northern Ireland, 2007M. Consiglio, S. Hoadley, D. Wing, B. Baxley and D.

Congress of the Aeronautical Sciences (ICAS 2010), 2010 which went deeper in the human factor aspects and set the foundations for separating strategic and tactical conflict management processes in self-separation. Other projects provided complementary contributions, such as the Advanced Safe Separation Technologies and Algorithmshttp://www.asstar.org/(ASSTAR), which carried out performance, safety and cost-benefit analyses for ASAS applications, including a limited version of Self-separation, resulting in positive findings. Based on the above-mentioned and other studies, ASAS-based self-separation has been selected as one of the goals to be pursued by major development programs in air traffic management, such as Single European Sky ATM Research & Development (SESAR) and the U.S. Next Generation Air Transportation Systemhttps://www.faa.gov/nextgen/(NextGen), even if limited to certain conditions and airspaces.  Recent developments  More recently, the iFly projecthttp://ifly.nlr.nl/ defined a new concept of operations of self- separation in higher density airspace, based on the works described above, and evaluated it quantitatively using advanced stochastic simulation methods. The results obtained from these studies indicate that self-separation can be safely used in an airspace with thrice the density of European en-route airspace as of in the year of 2005, if the ADS-B dependability level improves by a factor of five or if the TCAS dependability improves by the same factor.  Outstanding issues  Some of the most relevant issues to be solved for Self-separation are: * How to safely transition from controlled airspace to self-separation airspace? * What is the right balance between trajectory predictability and flexibility in order to achieve practical efficiency and acceptable safety? Although these topics have been researched and there are some solutions proposed for them, the complexity of the problem have prevented to achieve definitive responses.

Biography =Early life and education= Bishop Brungardt was born on July 10, 1958 in Salina, Kansas to Francis Balthasar and Virginia (n√©e Burton) Brungardt, where he was one of six brothers and sisters in a strong Catholic family. He chose his Confirmation Saint as Saint Joseph because he is a great role model for Catholic men and boys. He graduated from Benedictine College with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics with a minor in mathematics in 1980. He furthered his studies at Iowa State University, earning a Master of Science in physics in 1983, and at Kansas State University, earning a Doctor of Philosophy in curriculum and instruction. Brungardt had his \\"first career\\" as a science and computers teacher, moving to Wichita, Kansas in 1985 and teaching at Wichita Collegiate School and then at Kapaun Mt. Carmel High School. In 1990, Brungardt's mother died and that caused him to go through a spiritual reawakening, where he went to Fr. Paul Coakley for spiritual direction and vocational discernment. He entered priestly formation at Pontifical College Josephinum, where he earned a Master of Divinity and Master of Arts in Moral Theology in 1998. =Ordination and ministry= Brungardt was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Wichita by Bishop Eugene Gerber at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on May 23, 1998. As a diocesan priest, he served numerous assignments, including chaplain and religion teacher at Bishop Carroll Catholic High School, Director of the Office of Respect Life and Social Justice, and pastor of seven different parishes. In 2003, he spent five months in Mexico, studying the Spanish language and culture. From 2005 until 2010, he was Chancellor of the Diocese and Moderator of the Diocesan Office of Hispanic Ministry. =Bishop of Dodge City, Kansas= In November 2010, Father Brungardt received a call from Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Apostolic Nuncio to the United States. saying that Pope Benedict XVI had selected him to be sixth Bishop of Dodge City, replacing Bishop Ronald Gilmore, who had served there since 1998. On February 2, 2011, he was consecrated bishop by Archbishop Joseph Naumann, at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Guadalupe with Bishops Michael Jackels and Ronald Gilmore acting as co-consecrator. Brungardt chose his episcopal motto, \\"Filled With Compassion\\", from the story of the Prodigal Son found in the Gospel of Luke. The left side of his coat of arms is the shield of the Diocese of Wichita. The right side is divided into two halves. The superior side features a sun, which has a two-fold meaning: the sun symbolizes the light of God and the sunflower, which is the state flower of Kansas. The lower half features a rose, which also has a two-fold meaning. It shows the bishop's devotion to Mary, who is sometimes referred to as the \\"Mystical Rose\\" and is a representation of the Castilian roses given to St. Juan Diego by Our Lady of Guadalupe, who is the patron of the Diocese of Dodge City. Brungardt joins two other recent episcopal appointments from the Diocese of Wichita, Archbishop Paul Coakley of Oklahoma City and Bishop James Conley of Lincoln.

It was once part of the more sizable Irgens Estate. History The estate had its origin in a crown property which in 1666 was transferred to Joachim Irgens von Westervick as part of his acquisition of all the crown estates located in Helgeland, Salten, Lofoten, Vester√•len, Andenes, Senja, and Troms. When Joachim Irgens von Westervick died in 1675, the Irgens Estate was divided to satisfy creditors. In 1677, the Troms√∏ properties were taken over by Chancellor Gjert Lange (1649-1732), co-owner of R√∏ros Copper Works. The newly created estate consisted of approximately 120 farms and 90 Sami clearings (Norwegian: finnerydning). In 1705, Baroness Cornelia de Bickers von Westervick (1629-1708), the widow of Baron Joachim Irgens von Westervick, bought the Troms√∏ estate. She sat as a proprieterian until her death in 1708. In 1713, her brother, Baron Jacob de Petersen (1607-1659), took over the estate. His sons sold it in 1751 to the estate to merchant Johan Christian Hvid (1714-1765) from Trondheim. His father, Michael Hvid (1680-1757), had been the estate manager since 1716 and remained so until his death in 1765. In 1764, Johan Hysing bought the estate, and he was in 1771 followed by his son, Ahlert Hysing. His brother-in-law, Andreas R√∏st, bought the estate in 1772, and in 1777 and 1781, it was sold to Georg Wasmuth (1724-1800). On 10 June 1783, the Troms√∏ Estate was divided into three separate estates: * Skjerv√∏y Estate (Skjerv√∏ygodset) : The northern part, including Skjerv√∏y and K√•fjord up to the border of Finnmark, was taken over by Ahlert Hysing. * Karnes Estate (Karnesgodset): The middle part, including Helg√∏y, Karls√∏y, Ullsfjord and Lyngen, was taken over by Georg Wasmuth and later his son Ulrik Wasmuth (ca. 1765 1801). * Bentsjord Estate (Bentsjordgodset): The southern part, including Hilles√∏ and Troms, was taken over by Hans Andreas Moursund (1738-1802), who was married to Georg Wasmuth's daughter Elisabeth Margrete Wasmuth (1749-1786).

He also held the title of Count of Glatz.  Life  Johann Berger family was a member of the M√ºnsterberg branch of the noble Podƒõbrady family. His parents were Charles I, Duke of M√ºnsterberg-Oels and Anna of Sagan, daughter of Duke John II \\"the Mad\\" of ≈ªaga≈Ñ. On 20 February 1536 John married Christina Catherine of Schidlowitz (; 1519‚Äì1556). Later that year his father died. Initially, John ruled M√ºnsterberg-Oels jointly with his brothers Joachim, Henry II and George II. In a joint deed dated 25 June 1535, they awarded the city of Srebrna G√≥ra, which belonged to M√ºnsterberg, the status of free mining town. Unlike their father, Joachim and his brothers followed the Lutheran doctrine. In 1537, they expelled the Catholic priests from M√ºnsterberg and appointed an evangelical vicar. In 1542, Joachim and his brothers pledged the heavily indebted Duchy of M√ºnsterberg to their uncle Duke Frederick II of Legnica. That same year, the other possessions were divided: Henry II received the Duchy of Bernstadt, Joachim, the oldest of the brothers became Bishop of Brandenburg, while John continued the government in the Duchy of Oels. There he led the rebuilding of the castle into a Renaissance castle and the construction of a four storey Front Castle that would be used as Wittum. After the Duchy M√ºnsterberg was returned to the Podƒõbrady family in 1559, it was again ruled by John. After the death of his first wife he married on 8 September 1561 with Margarete, a daughter of Duke Henry II of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel who survived John by fifteen years. After John's death in 1565, he was succeeded by his only son, Charles Christoph as Duke of M√ºnsterberg. The Duchy of Oels was inherited by John's nephew Charles II, the Duchy of Bernstadt by his brother Henry III, who sold it in 1574. In 1557, after the death of his first wife, John had a sandstone tomb built for Christina and himself in the church in Oels. It was built by the sculptor Johannes Oslew from W√ºrzburg and is decorated with floral patterns and coats of arms. At the foot of the life-size figures of the Duke and Duchess are two lions. John's son, Charles Christopher died in 1569 after a brief reign as Duke of M√ºnsterberg at the age of 24 years. He was the last male descendant of the House of Podƒõbrady. After his death, the Duchy M√ºnsterberg reverted to the Crown of Bohemia.

The inscription describes a Ioudaios of Greek religion; such that in this context Shaye J. D. Cohen states the word must be translated as \\"Judean\\". Ioudaios (; pl. Ioudaioi). is an Ancient Greek ethnonym used in classical and biblical literature which commonly translates to \\"Jew\\" or \\"Judean\\".Jewish Encyclopedia The choice of translation is the subject of frequent scholarly debate, given its central importance to passages in the Bible (both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament) as well as works of other writers such as Josephus and Philo. Translating it as Jews is seen to imply connotations as to the religious beliefs of the people, whereas translating it as Judeans confines the identity within the geopolitical boundaries of Judea.James D. G. Dunn Jesus, Paul, and the Gospels 2011 Page 124 \\"6.6 and 9.17, where for the first time Ioudaios can properly be translated 'Jew' ; and in Greco-Roman writers, the first use of Ioudaios as a religious term appears at the end of the first century ce (90- 96, 127, 133-36). 12.\\" A related translation debate refers to the terms (verb), literally translated as \\"Judaizing\\" (compare Judaizers),Young's Literal Translation of and (noun), controversially translated as Judaism or Judeanism. Etymology and usage The Hebrew term Yehudi () occurs 74 times in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible. It occurs first in the Hebrew Bible in where Rezin king of Syria drove the 'Jews' out of Elath, and earliest among the prophets in Jeremiah 32:12 of 'Jews' that sat in the court of the prison.\\" In the Septuagint the term is translated Ioudaios. Ioudaismos The Ancient Greek term Ioudaismos (; from , \\"to side with or imitate the [Judeans]\\"),. often translated as \\"Judaism\\" or \\"Judeanism\\", first appears in 2 Maccabees in the 2nd century BCE. In the context of the age and period it held the meaning of seeking or forming part of a cultural entity and resembles its antonym Hellenismos, meaning acceptance of Hellenic (Greek) cultural norms (the conflict between Ioudaismos and Hellenismos lay behind the Maccabean revolt and hence the invention of the term Ioudaismos). Shaye J. D. Cohen wrote: > We are tempted, of course, to translate [Ioudaismos] as \\"Judaism,\\" but this > translation is too narrow, because in this first occurrence of the term, > Ioudaismos has not yet be reduced to designation of a religion. It means > rather \\"the aggregate of all those characteristics that makes Judaeans > Judaean (or Jews Jewish).\\" Among these characteristics, to be sure, are > practices and beliefs that we would today call \\"religious,\\" but these > practices and beliefs are not the sole content of the term. Thus Iouda√Øsmos > should be translated not as \\"Judaism\\" but as Judaeanness.Cohen, Shaye J.D. > (1999) The Beginnings of Jewishness: Boundaries, Varieties, Uncertainties > University of California Press. 105-106 Translation implications As mentioned above, translating it as \\"Jews\\" has implications about the beliefs of the people whereas translation as \\"Judeans\\" emphasizes their geographical origin. The word Ioudaioi is used primarily in three areas of literature in antiquity: the later books of the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple literature (e.g. the Books of the Maccabees), the New Testament (particularly the Gospel of John and Acts of the Apostles), and classical writers from the region such as Josephus and Philo. There is a wide range of scholarly views as to the correct translations with respect to each of these areas, with some scholars suggesting that either the words Jews or Judeans should be used in all cases, and other scholars suggesting that the correct translation needs to be interpreted on a case by case basis. One complication in the translation question is that the meaning of the word evolved over the centuries. For example, Morton Smith, writing in the 1999 Cambridge History of Judaism,Cambridge History of Judaism volume 3 page 210 states that from c.100 BCE under the Hasmoneans the meaning of the word Ioudaioi expanded further: > :For clarity, we may recall that the three main earlier meanings were: :(1) > one of the descendants of the patriarch Judah, i.e. (if in the male line) a > member of the tribe of Judah; :(2) a native of Judaea, a \\"Judaean\\"; :(3) a > \\"Jew\\", i.e. a member of Yahweh's chosen people, entitled to participate in > those religious ceremonies to which only such members were admitted. :Now > appears the new, fourth meaning: :(4) a member of the Judaeo-Samaritan- > Idumaean-Ituraean-Galilean alliance In 2001, the third edition of the Bauer lexicon, one of the most highly respected dictionaries of Biblical Greek,Rykle Borger, \\"Remarks of an Outsider about Bauer's W√∂rterbuch, BAGD, BDAG, and Their Textual Basis,\\" Biblical Greek Language and Lexicography: Essays in Honor of Frederick W. Danker, Bernard A. Taylor (et al. eds.) pp. 32‚Äì47. supported translation of the term as \\"Judean\\", writing: > Incalculable harm has been caused by simply glossing Ioudaios with ‚ÄòJew,‚Äô > for many readers or auditors of Bible translations do not practice the > historical judgment necessary to distinguish between circumstances and > events of an ancient time and contemporary ethnic-religious-social > realities, with the result that anti-Judaism in the modern sense of the term > is needlessly fostered through biblical texts.Danker, Frederick W. > \\"Ioudaios\\", in A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early > Christian Literature. third edition University of Chicago Press. In 2006, Amy-Jill Levine took the opposite view in her Misunderstood Jew, writing: \\"The translation 'Jew', however, signals a number of aspects of Jesus' behavior and that of other 'Jews', whether Judean, Galilean, or from the Diaspora: circumcision, wearing tzitzit, keeping kosher, calling God 'father', attending synagogue gatherings, reading Torah and Prophets, knowing that they are neither Gentiles nor Samaritans, honoring the Sabbath, and celebrating the Passover. All these, and much more, are markers also of traditional Jews today. Continuity outweighs the discontinuity.\\"Amy-Jill Levine. The Misunderstood Jew: The Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 2006, page 162 Academic publications in the last ten to fifteen years increasingly use the term Judeans rather than Jews. Most of these writers cite Steve Mason's 2007 article, \\"Jews, Judaeans, Judaizing, Judaism: Problems of Categorization in Ancient History\\". Mason and others argue that \\"Judean\\" is a more precise and a more ethical translation of ioudaios than is \\"Jew\\".Adele Reinhartz, \\"The Vanishing Jews of Antiquity\\" \\"Marginalia\\", L.A. Review of Books, June 24, 2014. Much of the debate stems from the use of the term in the New Testament where Ioudaios is often used in a negative context. Translating Ioudaios as \\"Judeans\\" implies simple people living in a geographic area, whereas translating the term as \\"Jews\\" implies a legalistic religious and ethnic component which in later Christian works was characterized as a religion devoid of \\"grace\\", \\"faith\\", and \\"freedom\\". It is this later understanding which some scholars have argued was not applicable in the ancient world. They argue that the New Testament texts need to be critically examined without the baggage that Christianity has associated with the term \\"Jew\\". Others such as Adele Reinhartz argue that New Testament Anti- Judaism cannot be so neatly separated from later forms of Anti-Judaism. Language comparison The English word Jew derives via the Anglo-French \\"Iuw\\" from the Old French forms \\"Giu\\" and \\"Juieu\\", which had elided (dropped) the letter \\"d\\" from the Medieval Latin form Iudaeus, which, like the Greek Ioudaioi it derives from, meant both Jews and Judeans / \\"of Judea\\". However, most other European languages retained the letter \\"d\\" in the word for Jew; e.g. Danish and Norwegian j√∏de, Dutch jood, German Jude, Italian giudeo, Spanish jud√≠o etc. The distinction of translation of Yehudim in Biblical Hebrew between \\"Judeans\\", and \\"Jews\\" is relevant in English translations of the Bible. {class=wikitable style -align:center !English !Modern Hebrew !Modern Standard Arabic !Latin !Ancient Greek -align:center !Jew ◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊ô Yehudi ŸäŸáŸàÿØŸä Yahudi Iudaeus  Ioudaios -align:center !\\"of Judea\\" or \\"Judean\\" ◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊ô Yehudi ŸäŸáŸàÿØŸä Yahudi Iudaeus  Ioudaios -align:center !Judea ◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊î Yehudah ŸäŸáŸàÿØŸäÿ© Yahudiyya Iudaea  IoudaiƒÅ } See also *Race of Jesus *Who is a Jew *Jew (word) *King of the Jews *Hellenistic Judaism *Judaizers *Proselytes *History of the Jews in the Roman Empire *Hebrews *Israelites Notes and references ;Notes ;References External links General references     Ioudaioi in the Gospel of John  * Uses of Ioudaios in the New Testament Category:Greek words and phrases Category:Jews and Judaism in Greece Category:Jewish Greek history Category:Hellenistic Jews Category:Ethnonyms ","title":"Ioudaios"},{"id":"32043322","text":"Shikufitzky is a comic strip appearing in the weekly Jewish magazine Mishpacha.

Carbonell's inexhaustible vision and his ever-changing style is the product of a brilliant talent with an academic background. Ceaselessly searching for the essence of form and the absence of details, he empowered a sense of strength and monumentality to his work. Until the age of 92, he had continued to work daily in his studio. Childhood Carbonell was born on October 25, 1918, in Sancti Spiritus (\\"Holy Spirit\\"), Cuba.Soler, Frank (2005). Carbonell, Futurcom,Inc, Key Biscayne, . He had two sisters the older, Josephine and the younger Angela. His father came from a family of eighteen brothers and sisters. The family history has its roots in early sugar farming, from the early 1800s. At an early age the family moved to the city of Cienfuegos and Carbonell went to study at \\"Monserrat\\" a primary school in the city. This proved to be the beginning of many lasting friendships. Since his early childhood he was recognized for his interest in drawings and carvings. Continuing on to his more formative academic years, in Havana he attended El Colegio de Belen,\\"Carbonell Sculpture as Door Prize\\", The Jewish Floridian, Boca Raton, 26 December 1980. a Jesuit Preparatory School where he excelled in the classes involving art and history. Creativity Carbonell first realized he wanted to be a sculptor when he was eight or nine years old. He was always making little figures with clay and whenever he found a piece of paper, he would doodle little figures on it. His harshest punishment as a child was when his mother took away his pencils and paper. Having the understanding that a piece of paper could be torn apart and disappear, ingrained in him that permanence could be achieved better by sculpting. Depression would set in when he was not involved in the process of creation.

But, as we all know, imagination can be very treacherous.\\" Education In 1937, he wanted to learn about art and found out about \\"San Alejandro\\", the renowned Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (National Academy of Fine Arts) in Havana. When he arrived, they asked him what previous training he had? Explaining, he told them he had none. The school wanted him to go through a preliminary process for two years prior to attending, however he managed to prove himself with a clay carving that he had made that following weekend and they accepted him as a student on the spot. Carbonell was eighteen years old and barely beginning at San Alejandro when he fell down some stairs. The injury was very severe; one of his kidneys had ruptured as a result of the impact. He spent nearly one year partly paralyzed, unable to move easily. He couldn't attend classes of course, the despair he felt, lying there, all that time was immeasurable. But little by little he learned to walk again, he just stubbornly refused to give up, finally able to return to San Alejandro. At the Academy Carbonell studied under the guidance of Juan Jos√© Sicre, a former student of Antoine Bourdelle, Rodin's favorite disciple.Santistevan,Alvaro. \\"Hands On, A visit with master sculptor Manuel Carbonell\\", Local Color, Miami, May 2003. In 1945 at the age of 27 Carbonell graduated with the title of Professor of Drawing and Sculpture. Carbonell met and worked alongside some great artist, Fidelio Ponce, Victor Manuel, Amelia Pelaez,Roberto Estopi√±an and many more. At San Alejandro, artistic excellence, meant one must measure up to maximum standards or smash it into pieces and start again, that was the norm. Beginnings as a sculptor His classical and religious period developed between 1945 and 1959 some of his many important commissions included the stone carvings as bas-reliefs of the Twelve Stations of the Cross, along with The Last Rites located at Las Lomas Del Jacan in San Miguel de los Ba√±os, Matanzas province. Last Rites,\\"White House Gets Carbonell Eagle\\", The Times of the Americas, Washington D.C., 7 July 1976. was exhibited at the National Capitol in Havana. He also sculpted a statue of the Virgin Mary for the Association of Catholic University students in Havana.Alvarez,Ana Maria. \\"Tragedy and trauma of exile reflected in sculptor's work\\", Times/Guide, Coral Gables, 26/27 June 1976. A life size wood carving of a crucifixion for the chapel at the Covadonga sugar mill in Las Villas, Cuba. Carbonell's work received immediate recognition. Dr. Roberto Lopez-Goldaras, the art critic of Havana's Diario De La Marina, in Havana, said in 1951 about his work, \\"We foresee for the young and distinguished sculptor Manuel Carbonell a great future; (he) who had been able to conceive a sculpture like \\"Eternity\\", will without a doubt, earn himself a glorious name, which is already a euphoric name, accredited among the literary and artistic names of Cuba.\\" Carbonell carving out of Capellania stone, typical of Cuba, this resembles granite because of its density. Carbonell participated in numerous national competitions and was the recipient of many awards. The life-size stone carving Fin de Una Raza (End of A Race) earned him his first international award in 1954, for the III Bienal Hispanoamericana de Arte, in Barcelona, Spain. The sculpture became part of the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Havana; it appeared on the cover of Reader's Digest magazine in May 1956.Barnell,J.D.. \\"Palacio de Bellas Artes-Patio, La Habana..Cover\\", Reader's Digest, Havana, May 1956. Professional journey Manuel Carbonell (right) with Wifredo Lam. For the first commercial television broadcast, \\"Union Radio Television\\", Carbonell was the host and interviewer for a weekly television program where he interviewed artist as his topic of discussion, to include Wifredo Lam, amongst others. He worked in various aspects of television and production whereby he won an award in set design for the 'Union De La Cronica Tele-Radial Diaria\\" in the second festival. By 1954 Carbonell left for Europe visiting countless museums with the goal of experiencing for himself the opportunity to stand in front of great masterpieces to appreciate them and learn. He was able to explore countries such as Spain, Italy, France and England and understand their unique cultures. Europe proved to inspire Carbonell as he studied the art of the Impressionist and Abstract artists, which inspired a change in direction to give form a sense of movement.Roiz,Carman Teresa. \\"Manuel Carbonell Creates a New Miami Landmark\\", The Miami Herald, Vista Magazine, May 1995. In addition to his accomplishments as a sculptor, he owned an operated his own interior design business \\"Carbonell Studio\\".Jacobson,Ellen. \\"Cuban Finds Success Here\\", The Record, New Jersey, 30 September 1968. Here he designed from French to Modern furniture, incorporating his other beloved interest of creating an environment. He also had a high-end luxury boutique of decorative objects, which ultimately provided him with an ulterior motive of a purchasing trip, he was granted a visa to travel to the United States. The perfect opportunity for defecting and leaving his homeland. Exile to New York City In 1959, Carbonell fled Cuba where he could no longer live under a totalitarian regime. Leaving behind his wealth, his established positions, his sculptures, and most importantly his family. He arrived in New York City with only his tremendous talent and $200 in cash and initially took up residency at the YMCA. Carbonell moved away from his classical and religious period, in Cuba in the late 1940s and 1950s through the commencement and development of his modern expressions of the 1960s. Although at the beginning deeply depressed, this new trajectory first moved him to a unique form of figurative abstraction where the anatomy was subjected to the anatomical elongation of the subject matter. Carbonell's new career in America started almost haphazardly and by chance. As payment to his then public relations manager Ted Materna and Associates he provided one of his first sculptures in clay that he had created. A very prominent doctor, Paul Henkind,Wolff,Millie. \\"Carbonell Carves His Creativity Into Any Material\\", Palm Beach Daily News, Palm Beach, 19 February 1989. then Chief of the Department of Ophthalmology at Monte Fiore Hospital, NYC, noticed the incredible sculpture and stated to Mr. Materna \\"I didn't know you owned a Rodin\\"? Which was actually a Carbonell. He insisted on meeting Carbonell to see his work and showed up unannounced at his studio in SoHo, that same evening with his wife they purchased their own Carbonell and became long lasting patrons. Shortly after in 1961, Manuel Carbonell was introduced to Dr. Fred Schoneman, the influential and renowned gallery owner, who was impressed with what he saw of Carbonells work, and invited him to become the gallery's first and only sculptor and he is quoted saying \\"He is indeed, as the critics have acclaimed and posterity will confirm, one of the Masters of Sculpture of our times\\". The gallery exhibited Carbonell's sculptures alongside European Masters and French Impressionist paintings of the 19th and 20th centuries, such as Braque, Chagall, Monet, Degas, Pissarro, Picasso, Gauguin, Renior and others. Professional artistic success came with his new figuration sculptures when in 1963, he celebrated the first of his several \\"One Man Show\\" at the renowned Schoneman Gallery, Madison Avenue, in New York City, and collaborated in One Man Show's with other galleries, exceeding ten years, until Dr. Schonemans' passing. For his first exhibition at Schoneman Galleries, Carbonell departed from clay and plaster forms and worked in hammered metals. During this time, one sensed the influence of Pablo Gargallos' figurative abstract modern sculptures. In 1967 he extended his frontier to include another one-man show in San Francisco at the Maxwell Galleries. By 1971,Carbonell held two exhibits, one again at Schoneman and the other at the Bacardi Galleries in Miami, Florida. At this time, Carbonell moved from his previously acclaimed hammered metals and bronze finishes to high-polished bronzes sculptures.Von Maurer,Bill. \\"A varied Talent\\", The Miami News, Miami, 20 February 1973. This new work took on a completely different aesthetic, becoming more abstract. Rounded volumes replaced the elongated anatomical shapes, present in Lovers, Madonna of the Moon and Figurative Form. During an exhibition at Galerie Moos, in 1972, in Montreal, Canada, the artist unveiled new subject matters through his high-polish bronze sculptures of Sea Horses, a Sea Lion, Snail and Mermaid. Renamed as Randall Galleries, a former employee of Schoneman Galleries took control over the gallery in 1973, while Carbonell was preparing an exhibition that would pay tribute to dance. The dancer series was a means to show his appreciation of dance as an art form, embracing the two art forms. The delicate lines of the ballet dancers are executed from a single point of balance. The graceful forms portray the excitement of their movement and beauty which is captured in reflective golden bronze. The opportunity to amplify this series turned into a benefit for The City Center in New York City to have an exhibition titled \\"Homage to Ballet\\" in 1974.Sheppard,Eugenia. \\"Eugenia Sheppard Around the Town\\", New York Post, New York City, 19 November 1974. Reuniting with family Carbonell took in his two nephews, in 1960, Ricardo 15 and Luis 13 to live with him in New Jersey to save them from being inducted into Castro's military army.Lindley,Daniel. \\"A Wonderful Life, An expatriate sculptor in Miami reflects on his life, times and public and private art in Cuba, Brickell Key and beyond\\", Coastal Elegance & Wealth, Naples, Summer 2006. Soon enough, nine months later his father Manuel and his sisters Angela and Josefina with her 2-year-old daughter, Clara were able to leave Cuba and come to Miami. After so many years living apart Carbonell was anxious to rejoin his family, he moved his studio to Miami in 1976. Keeping a much lower profile he continued creating and selling his sculptures and concentrated on important private commissions. During 1977 Carbonell was given the challenge to construct the \\"Virgin of Fatima\\", for the Blue Army Shrine, in Washington, New Jersey. The 26-foot, 12,000 pound bronze sculpture was placed on top of a 150-foot shrine, considered one of the largest sculptures cast in America in the 20th century. His first commissioned bronze monument in the United States:Soler, Frank. \\"What's Up Miami, Prominent Cuban Artist\\", The Miami Herald/Local New Section, Miami, 18 July 1977.Stevens,Jean M.. \\"Shrine leaders ponder raising of 26-foot statue\\", The Forum, Cliffton, 5 August 1979. A special and personal monumental sculpture during this same time was a composition of a 10-foot in height horse and rider, balanced on two points, which was commissioned by Burt Reynolds of himself for the entrance of the Burt Reynolds Jupiter Theatre, Jupiter, Florida. The two men had a very fond and enduring friendship.Fischer, Bonnie. \\"International Sculptor Manuel Carbonell Honored at Burt Reynolds Jupiter Theatre\\", The Palm Beacher, Palm Beach, 15 October 1986. The awards formally presented by The South Florida Entertainment Writers Associations (SFEWA), an organization of major media theater critics from Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties, on November 15, 1976, they selected Carbonell as the namesake. He was the creator of the award and The Estate of Manuel Carbonell continues to be the major benefactor of the \\"Carbonell Awards\\". They represent the highest achievement awards that annually recognizes and honors excellence in South Florida theater. The organization considered this tribute to Carbonell, as he signified and represented one who devotes his life to art.Zink,Jack. \\"New Season Waiting in Wings As Past Season Gets Awards\\", Fort Lauderdale News Sun Sentinel, Fort Lauderdale, 14 November 1976.http://carbonellawards.org/about . In 1976, Carbonell held a monographic exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum and Art Center, in Miami, Florida, on view at the opening of their newest gallery, where he introduced more than 20 of his latest works.Smith,Griffen. \\"Carbonell's Sensusous Sculptures Are Much More Than Movement\\", The Miami Herald, Miami, 12 September 1976. (Now incorporated into, The Frost Art Museum). Between the late seventies and mid-eighties, the artist worked on private commissions and ventured creatively in designing jewelry and furniture. At that time, he had several one-man shows that were also presented at different galleries during this decade, including Steiner Gallery in Bal Harbor, West Avenue Gallery in Palm Beach, Camino Real in Boca Raton, all in Florida and the Ann Jacob Gallery, in Marietta, Georgia. The White House Internationally known Cuban Sculptor Manuel Carbonell, presenting his bronze eagle, as a symbol of freedom. In 1976 Carbonell created the \\"Bicentennial Eagle\\", which he gifted to the United States of America, during a ceremony on the West Lawn of the White House in honor of the nation's Bicentennial Anniversary. During the bicentennial celebrations the sculpture was on display in the Great Hall of Commerce in Washington D.C. This sculpture is now part of The Gerald R. Ford, Presidential Library, Ann Arbor, Michigan, which is technically a branch office of The National Archives and Records Administration Collection, that the Federal government oversees.Carmen Teresa Roiz,Dorthy Gaiter. \\"President To Receive Bicentennial Eagle\\", The Miami Herald, Miami, 29 June 1976. Beaux Arts Gallery A formal representation begun in 1987 as Beaux Arts Gallery, Miami Florida, became the exclusive worldwide representative of Carbonell's work, under the Owner/Director, Ricardo J. Gonzalez III, an architect and Carbonell's nephew. During the following years, his endless creative imagination took him to follow in the steps of European Masters such as Moore, Brancusi, and Arp and other artist of the figurative abstract movement. In Carbonells' sculptures you can experience the monumentality of the works of Henry Moore, and the simplicity found in the works of Brancusi, Archipenko and Arp, but in his oeuvre, he sought a different form of figuration, where he searched for the essence of the form and the absence of details while empowering a feeling of monumentality to his sculptures. At this time Carbonell moved from his high polished bronzes to dark patinas. His figurative abstract sculptures created an impression or illusion of form and space, which are representational and based on the anatomical simplification of the form from a variety of sources. His distinctive personal style is easily identifiable and recognized by the consistency in the originality of his works, the uniqueness of his interpretations and the sense of universal appeal that he imparted to his sculptures. The years between 1987-88 marked a very creative and productive period for Carbonell. Lovers, mother and child, dancers and the female figure intensified as subject matter in his artistic vision. He redefined forms and contours, while maintaining the anatomical essence of the human figure, bringing female sensuality to a point of abstraction, while displaying a sense of aesthetic basic principles in a simplified form. A continuance of one-man shows and exhibits along with art fairs nationally and internationally have since to date been part of this relationship.Gonzalez,Ricardo III. \\"Carbonell Sculptures: An important component of any serious Fine Art collection\\", Miami Art Guide Magazine, Miami, December 2004. Having won a competition in 1989 to create a statue of the Cuban Apostle Jose Mart√≠ for the San Carlos Institute in Key West, Florida. Carbonell returned for this commission to his classical period to create the statue. A subject very close to Carbonell's heart: the artist struggled with the challenge of translating the human Mart√≠ into the idealized and heroic universal figure that Mart√≠'s philosophy and spirituality represented. Conquering this challenge, in 1990 Carbonell moved to Pietrasanta, (Holy Stone) Italy to carve a 6-foot marble sculpture that portrays Mart√≠ with his left arm extended, as if to greet visitors, while the right hand rest on a bundle of wheat surrounded by the Cuban flag. The symbolism conveyed by the statue is that a cause, like one stalk of wheat, may become weak, but becomes strong when its supporters band together.Von Maurer,Bill. \\"Mart√≠ Statue marks historic center's rebirth\\", Sun-Sentinel, Miami, 4 January 1992. The Miami River Bridge This bridge on Brickell Avenue was the first time that the Florida Dept. of Transportation incorporated architecture, art and engineering in a bridge design. Carbonell was selected in a competition in 1992, this was to create one of the largest bronze monuments in the State of Florida, the artwork for Miami's Brickell Avenue Bridge, Miami Florida.Chardy,Alfonso. \\"Miami's Rainbow City's past shines as Brickell Bridge opens\\", The Miami Herald, Miami, 9 December 1995. Carbonell created the 53-foot bronze public monument \\"The Pillar of History and the Tequesta Family\\", located mid-span on the bridge. The pillar illustrates a carved graphical narration of the lives of the Tequesta Indians, Miami's first inhabitants, featuring 150 figures. At the top stands a 17-foot bronze sculpture, \\"Tequesta Family\\" portraying a Tequesta Indian warrior aiming an arrow to the sky with his wife and child at his side. In the niches at the supporting piers are four 4-foot by 8-foot bronze bas reliefs honoring the quintessential Miami pioneers Henry Flagler, Dana A. Dorsey, William and Mary Brickell, Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Julia Tuttle, depicting them in their historical perpetual settings. Twelve bronze bas-reliefs of Florida fauna are located at the base of the flagpoles on the walk ways of both sides of the bridge.Parks, Arva Moore (2008).

It was the first or second film directed by Hermann Kosterlitz, who left Germany before the film was completed and later worked in the United States under the name Henry Koster, and the last German film in which Dolly Haas appeared; she also later emigrated to the US. A riot broke out at the premi√®re to protest the male lead, Max Hansen, who was supposedly \\"too Jewish.\\" The film's representation of the \\"ugly girl\\" as outsider has been described as a metaphorical way to explore the outsider existence of Jews.  Background and reception  Das h√§√üliche M√§dchen was filmed at the Avanti Tonfilm studios in Grunewald, Berlin in January-February 1933, the first months of Hitler's term as Reich Chancellor. Between filming and the 8 September premi√®re at the Atrium-Theater,Sabine Hake, Popular Cinema of the Third Reich, Austin: University of Texas, 2001, , p. 24. the Nazis had begun to define and institute their official policies of anti-Semitism in relation to the cinema. In March, the Propaganda Ministry had been created and Goebbels had declared that German cinema must become a v√∂lkisch art form. In June, the Film Credit Bank had been founded to control the staffing of films through their funding and the Aryan clause had forbidden non-Germans and non-\\"Aryans\\", with few exceptions, from participating in the production or distribution of German films.Hake, p. 27. In mid-July, the Reich Film Chamber had been formed, with membership required for continued employment in cinema.Hake, p. 28.Mary- Elizabeth O'Brien, Nazi Cinema as Enchantment: The Politics of Entertainment in the Third Reich, Studies in German Literature, Linguistics, and Culture, Rochester, New York: Camden House, 2004, , pp. 6-7.

Kosterlitz, who was Jewish, had left Germany months before the premi√®re, without seeing the final cut. His name was removed from the credits and replaced by an \\"Aryan\\" pseudonym, \\"Hasse Preis\\".Karsten Witte, Lachende Erben, toller Tag: Filmkom√∂die im Dritten Reich, Berlin: Vorwerk 8, 1995, , p. 57 He went to Paris in April, then via Budapest and Vienna to Hollywood in 1936.

The male lead, Max Hansen, was reputed to be part-Jewish and the previous year had performed a comic song implying that Hitler was homosexual; at the opening, in a riot orchestrated by the Nazis, members of the audience attacked him as \\"too Jewish\\", shouting \\"We want German movies! We want German actors!\\",Hake, p. 37. and he was pelted with tomatoes.Bock and Bergfelder, p. 178.Bock and Bergfelder, pp. 180-81.Klaus Kreimeier, The Ufa Story: A History of Germany's Greatest Film Company, 1918-1945, tr.

In the words of the review in Film-Kurier: > [W]histling was heard from various sides. The applause stopped. The > whistling continued. The curtain remained closed because rotten eggs were > thrown at the stage. Someone called from the balcony: \\"We want German > movies! We want German actors!

Hansen also soon left Germany, for Vienna and then Denmark. Dolly Haas was an exclusively comedic actress with an androgynous persona well suited to a film about appearance and the performance of identity; there were rumours about her racial heritage, too, but they were squashed with statements that she came \\"from a good Aryan family\\". Upset by the treatment of her co-star, she accepted an invitation to work in England in 1934 and left Germany for good in 1936.George Grosz and Max Herrmann-Neisse, ed. Klaus V√∂lker, \\"Ist schon das Leben\\": der Briefwechsel, Berlin: Transit, 2003, , p. 142 Hake, p. 236, note 25.Witte, p. 57 presents it as an immediate response: \\"Dolly Haas ging ins Exil nach England unmittelbar nach den Tumulten um die Premiere ihres Films Das h√§√üliche M√§dchen, bei der Nazihorden faule Eier auf die Leinwand warfen, weil Haas mit dem als j√ºdisch angegriffenen Komiker Max Hansen zusammen spielte\\" - \\"Dolly Haas went into exile in England immediately after the tumult surrounding the premi√®re of her film Das h√§√üliche M√§dchen, at which Nazi hordes splattered the screen with rotten eggs because Haas played alongside the comedian Max Hansen, who was under attack as Jewish\\". The film did receive praise for its humour, and reviews included phrases such as \\"pleasant\\", \\"amusing\\" and \\"full of delightful ideas\\". The Film-Kurier review noted that there was applause when the film ended, and an ovation for Haas, before she brought out Hansen.Gerhard Stahr, Volksgemeinschaft vor der Leinwand?: der nationalsozialistische Film und sein Publikum, Berlin: Theissen, 2001, , p. 144 During this transitional year, Nazi control over the film industry had yet to be consolidated and practices and attitudes varied.Hake, p. 26. Otto Wallburg was Jewish and was to die in Auschwitz, but continued to work in films in Germany until 1936 under the exemption for veterans of the First World War; in this film his role was simply characterised in the press as a typically sex- and money-obsessed member of the Berlin nouveau riche.  Plot summary  Lotte M√§rz (Dolly Haas) is hired as a secretary at an insurance company because she is ugly; introducing her to the (male) accountants, the personnel manager says, \\"I hope that you will finally be able to work in peace.\\" The men harass her and conspire to lure her into a compromising position by having one of them, Fritz Mahldorf (Max Hansen) pretend to find her attractive. The manager discovers her in an embrace with Fritz and fires her. The self-absorbed Fritz, showing remorse that is unusual for him, arranges for her to be rehired as assistant to Director M√∂nckeberg (Otto Wallburg, a comical figureHolger Schettler, Arbeiter und Angestellte im Film: die Darstellung der sozialen Lage von Arbeitern und Angestellten im deutschen Spielfilm 1918-1939, TRI-ERGON Schriften zum Film 1, Bielefeld: Verlag f√ºr Regionalgeschichte, 1992, , p. 192 ). Lotte has fallen for him, but he makes a date at his flat with the Director's girlfriend, Lydia (Genia Nikolaieva). Soon after she arrives, so does Lotte, and then so does the jealous Director. Farcical misunderstandings ensue, including the discovery of Lydia's fur coat and a fancy-dress ball at the Director's villa in which Lotte dresses as a pirate (just like the Director). Lotte undergoes a complete makeover at a beauty parlour: haircut, perm and facial--and is transformed into an attractive flapper. (As the New York Times reviewer put it, \\"As always, however, the ugly duckling becomes a disturbingly graceful swan.\\"The New York Times Film Reviews, 1913-1968, 6 vols., Volume 2, New York: New York Times, 1970.) Fritz falls in love with her and love triumphs, although he remains a flatterer and a deceiver and she has contemplated suicide.Hake, pp. 32-38.  Critical theories  The film has been seen as a treatment of the exclusion of Jews through the metaphor of the familiar trope of sexism and the need for women to self-present as acceptably feminine. Lotte's initial ugliness translates as \\"she looks too Jewish.\\"Hake, p. 31. Early in the film, she protests, \\"But I haven't done anything to you!\\", which applies also to the situation of the Jews.Hake, p. 35. Hansen, the presumed Jew with characteristically \\"Jewish\\" features, playing Fritz, the tormentor with the stereotypically German name, and Haas, the blonde and childish-looking Lotte being excoriated as \\"ugly\\" (i.e. Jewish) effect a displacement of the problem of otherness in order to enact a narrative of accommodation making use of the traditional romantic comedy plot of the girl getting a makeover to attract the boy.Hake, p. 36.  Unrealised Brecht project  Bertolt Brecht wanted to make a film of the same title featuring Valeska Gert, but this project never came to fruition.Frank-Manuel Peter, Valeska Gert: T√§nzerin, Schauspielerin, Kabarettistin; eine dokumentarische Biographie, 2nd ed.

Finlayson was born in Scotland in 1770. His descendants make him the second son of Colonel John Hamilton M'Finlay, who married, about 1765, Lady Elizabeth Mary Alexander, eldest sister of the last Earl of Stirling. He was originally a writer at Cupar, Fife, and removed thence to Edinburgh. His relations with Brothers, which began in 1797, are detailed in the article on that enthusiast. He printed at Edinburgh a couple of pamphlets before repairing to London. In London he was 'in considerable practice as a house agent.' Brothers led him to change the spelling of his name, by telling him his ancestors had some 'fine leys' of land granted them for deeds of valour. Brothers, who died (1824) in Finlayson's house at Marylebone, made it his dying charge to his friend that he should write against a rival genius, Bartholomew Prescot of Liverpool. This Finlayson did, describing Prescot's 'System of the Universe,' very correctly, as a 'misapprehended mistaken elaborate performance, or book.' Publications He printed a variety of pamphlets, reiterating Brothers's views, and developing his own peculiar notions of astronomy, for which he claimed a divine origin. The heavenly bodies were created, he thinks, partly 'to amuse us in observing them.' The earth he decides to be a perfect sphere, 'not shaped like a garden turnip, as the Newtonians make it;' the sun is a created body 'very different from anything we can make here below;' the stars are 'oval-shaped immense masses of frozen water, with their largest ends foremost.' Finlayson printed: # 'An Admonition to the People of all Countries in support of Richard Brothers,' 8vo (dated Edinburgh, 7 Sept. 1797). # The same, 'Book Second,' containing 'The Restoration of the Hebrews to their own Land,' 8vo (dated Edinburgh, 27 Jan. 1798). # 'An Essay,' &c.; 8vo (on Dan. xii. 7, 11,12; dated London, 2 March 1798). # 'An Essay on the First Resurrection, and on the Commencement of the Blessed Thousand Years,' 8vo (dated London, 14 April 1798). # 'The Universe as it is. Discovery of the Ten Tribes of Israel and their Restoration to their own Land,' 1832, 8 vo. # 'God's Creation of the Universe,' 1848, 8vo (contains some of his letters to the authorities respecting his claims on Brothers's estate ; Mason and Prescot were angry at this publication, but Finlayson had 'a dream and vision' of Brothers, approving all he had done). # 'The Seven Seals of the Revelations.' # 'The Last Trumpet,' &c.;, 1849, 8vo (incorporates No. 7 ; there are several supplements, the latest dated 21 Feb. 1850). Also nine large sheets of the ground plan of the New Jerusalem (with its 56 squares, 320 streets, 4 temples, 20 colleges, 47 private palaces, 16 markets, &c.;); and twelve sheets of views of its public buildings; all these executed by Finlayson for Brothers (the original copper-plates were in the hands of Beauford, whose price for a set of the prints was 38l.) Finlayson's pamphlets are scarce; he deposited his stock with Mason, after whose death it was destroyed. Personal life He married, in 1808, Elizabeth Anne (d. 1848), daughter of Colonel Basil Bruce (d. 1800), and had ten children. His eldest son, Richard Brothers Finlayson, who took the name of Richard Beauford, was a photographer at Galway, where he died on 17 Dec. 1886, aged 75. Old age and death Finlayson was reduced in extreme and widowed age to a parish allowance of 3s. 6d. weekly, supplemented by 5s. from Busby, in whose house Brothers had lived from 1806 to 1815. Prescot and John Mason (a brush-maker), though a disciple of Brothers, refused to assist him. He died on 19 Sept. 1854, and was buried in the same grave as Brothers at St John's Wood.

Its mission is to help religious minorities from all forms of persecution through assistance, advocacy, and awareness. History ICC was founded in 1995 by Steve Snyder, former president of the USA Division of Christian Solidarity International. In 2002, Snyder was succeeded as ICC President by Jeff King, who had served 11 years with Campus Crusade for Christ. The organization has issued reports on persecution of Christians in countries such as China, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Algeria. In recent years ICC has also worked to raise the profile of religious persecution in Mexico, Pakistan, Egypt, and India along with individual cases such as Sudanese Christian mother Meriam Ibrahim and Pakistani Christian Asia Bibi. Mission International Christian Concern (ICC) works to raise public awareness and provide advocacy for persecuted Christians and other religious minorities around the world. ICC assists victims of religious persecution through direct assistance, awareness, and advocacy initiatives. The organization also assists Congress and the Executive Branch in providing research and evaluation to effectuate policies to safeguard religious freedom.  Areas of focus  = Advocacy = ICC strives to work with various government entities, both domestically and internationally to enact change through the legislative process, pressure countries who persecute Christian minorities, and secure the release of the prisoners of conscience. ** August, 2012: Saudi Arabia releases 35 Ethiopian Christians arrested at an underground church service in Jeddah after an extensive advocacy campaign. ** August 2013: interview on Fox News Special Report with Brett Baier discussing the torching of 40+ Christian churches in Egypt. ** November 2013: The U.S. designates Boko Haram a \\"Foreign Terrorist Organization\\", putting in place economic sanctions and travel bans against the group. ** March 2014: 70 members of Congress write to President Obama urging him to address human rights and religious freedom in Saudi Arabia.

The formalism describes entities, which may exist in different states, which in turn have various properties. In addition there is a set of \\"contexts\\" (corresponding to measurements) by which an entity may be observed. The formalism has primarily found use outside of physics as a theory of concepts, in particular in the field of quantum cognition, which develops quantum-like models of cognitive phenomena (such as the conjunction fallacy) that may seem paradoxical or irrational when viewed from a perspective of classical states and logic.  State COntext Property (SCOP) formalism  Our minds are able to construct a multitude of imaginary, hypothetical, or counterfactual deviations from the more prototypical states of particular concept, and the State COntext Property (SCOP) can model this. The SCOP formalism was inspired by the need to incorporate the effect of context into the formal description of a concept. It builds on an operational approach in the foundations of quantum mechanics in which a physical system is determined by the mathematical structure of its set of states, set of properties, the possible (measurement) contexts which can be applied to this entity, and the relations between these sets. The SCOP formalism is part of a longstanding effort to develop an operational approach to quantum mechanics known as the Geneva-Brussels approach. With SCOP it is possible to describe situations with any degree of contextuality. In fact, classical and quantum come out as special cases: quantum at the one end of extreme contextuality and classical at the other end of extreme lack of contextuality. The SCOP formalism permits one to describe not only physical or conceptual entities, but also potential entities of a more abstract nature, which means that SCOP aims at a very general description of how the interaction between context and the state of an entity plays a fundamental role in its evolution.  SCOP entities  The description of SCOP entities seeks for a general description of an observable entity that evolves with time. Thus, the description of the entity needs to consider the different states that the entity can assume. In order to establish the differences among the states, we need to consider the properties that the states can hold. Note that a complete description of the states in terms of their properties requires that each state must hold a different properties, but in principle this is not the case. In order to observe the entity, we need a mechanism that permits us to measure properties on the states, i.e. there must exist a set of useful measurements or contexts that permits us to observe what properties are held by the current state the entity. However, the context can affect the state of the entity, and change its state (this is well known as the observer effect). Formally, a SCOP entity consists of a 5-tuple (\\\\Sigma,\\\\Mu,\\\\mathit{L},\\\\mu, u), where \\\\Sigma represents the set of states that the entity can assume, \\\\Mu represents a set of contexts (measurements), \\\\mathit{L} represents a set of properties that the entity can hold, \\\\mu:\\\\Sigma\\\\times \\\\Mu\\\\times \\\\Sigma\\\\to [0,1],~(p,e,q)\\\\mapsto \\\\mu(p,e,q) is a state-transition probability function that represents the likelihood to transition from the state p to the state q under the influence of the context e, and u:\\\\Sigma\\\\times\\\\mathit{L}\\\\to[0,1],~(p,a)\\\\mapsto[0,1] is a property- applicability function that estimates how applicable is the property a to the state p of the entity.  Special states and contexts  It is possible to identify relations among the states and contexts, that recall the basic elements of the quantum formalism: = Unitary context and ground state = It is possible that the entity is in a situation of no contextual influence. We identify such situation by the unitary context, denoted by \\\\mathbf{1}. Moreover, the state of the entity in this situation is identified by the ground state \\\\hat{p}. We have that \\\\mu(\\\\hat{p},\\\\mathbf{1},\\\\hat{p})=1, and thus \\\\mu(p,\\\\mathbf{1},\\\\hat{p})=1 for all p\\\\in \\\\Sigma, p eq \\\\hat{p}. Thus, the interaction of the entity with any context different from the unitary context will lead to an evolutionary process of the state's entity. = Eigenstates and potentiality = If for some context e there is a state p such that \\\\mu(p,e,p)=1, we say p is an eigenstate for the context e. Any state q that is not an eigenstate, it is referred to as potential state.  Order theory and SCOP  It is possible to describe the elements of SCOP using order-theoretic structures. In it has been shown how to obtain a pre-ordered set of states and properties. In it is shown that the set of contexts and properties can be equipped with an orthocomplemented lattice structure. By imposing axioms on the order-theoretical structures of the former elements of a SCOP entity it is possible, via representation theoretical techniques, to obtain the Hilbert space description of the entity.  SCOP concepts  The SCOP approach to concepts belongs to the emergent field of quantum cognition. In a SCOP model of a concept we are able to incorporate all of the possible contexts that could influence the state of a concept. The more states and contexts included, the richer the model becomes. The level of refinement is determined by the role the model is expected to play. It is outstanding that in SCOP, unlike other mathematical models of concepts, the potential to include this richness is present in the formalism, i.e., it can incorporate even improbable states, and largely but not completely irrelevant contexts. The SCOP formalism has been successfully applied to model conceptual entities. It has been used shown how to solve the inconsistencies of other mathematical model of concepts, and at the same time it permits to join different perspectives coming from psychology and phylosophy. = Contextual dependence = Early concept theorists such Eleanor Rosch have noted that the context in which a concept is elicited plays a fundamental role in the meaning that it takes in natural reasoning tasks such as learning or planning. While in some theories, such as G√§rdenfors or Nosofsky theories of concepts, the context is modeled as a weighting function across attributes or properties, in SCOP any effect of context occurs by way of its effect on the state. = Typicality, membership and similarity = Many researchers in concepts such as Hampton, Kamp and Partee, Osherson and Smith, among others, have noticed that measures of typicality and membership in concepts are not equivalent. Typicality refers to how common or representative is an instance of a concept. Membership, rather than measuring representativeness, only measures the allegiance or inclusiveness of a conceptual instances in the category determined by the concept. It is well known that both measures are context-dependent, and they have been related to the notion of similarity of concepts, in that concept- similarity would be a more fundamental notion and will imply determine their values. But no satisfactory mathematical theory of concept-similarity has been developed yet. In SCOP, similarity, membership, typicality, and any other measure, is modeled as a measurement-operator that acts on the state of the concept, in the same way as context do. This general manner of approach the measurement of quantities that permits to differentiate states are called \\"experiment-contexts\\". = Concept combination and emergence = Emergence of meaning in context theory: Guppy is neither a typical PET nor a typical FISH, but contrary to classical logic, it is a typical PET-FISH. The emergence of meaning when concepts are combined is at the core of the drawbacks in concept theories. For example, it has been shown that Guppy is neither a typical instance of concept PET, nor of concept FISH, but it is a highly typical instance of the combined concept PET-FISH. It has been proven that no logical- based approach can explain the ways these effects in concept combination. The SCOP-based approach to concepts has been shown to model the concept combination in a satisfactory manner, by embedding the states of the combined concept in tensor space formed by the Hilbert spaces representing each concept.

The statue was brought from the village Kƒôb≈Ço WƒÖwolnica, hence its name. Figurine The Gothic sculpture of the Madonna and Child dates from the first half of the fifteenth century (around 1420 to 1440). It was made from a trunk of the lime tree with a height of 85 cm and a diameter at its widest point 27 cm. Its prototype was a stone statue of the Madonna from Vimperk. This style of sculpture is characterized by elegance and courtliness in presenting subtly, drawing a regular face and the richness and decorative draperies into the system. The mother figure is shown presenting the child Jesus to the world. History of worship The tradition of the cult of Our Lady of Kƒôb≈Ço and WƒÖwolnica probably dates back to the period of invasions by the Tatars at the end of the 13th century. According to parish records, in the first days of September, 1278, Tartar raiders were sent to the vicinity of WƒÖwolnica. In the village of Kƒôb≈Ço, the Tatars set up camp to gather stolen goods and hold people captive. They set on a huge boulder, a stolen statue of the Virgin Mary. At the same time the G≈Çuskiem Opole Polish troops under the command of Otto Jastrzƒôbczyk had taken up resistance to the invaders. The Poles won the battle. When the defeated Tatars wanted to flee with their stolen goods and prisoners, the figure of the Virgin Mary lifted itself into the air, moved a considerable distance and hung above them. Terrified, the Tartars abandoned their stolen goods and prisoners and escaped. After their escape, the figure stood once again at its original location. Seeing this, the prisoners decided that it was God himself who had restored their freedom. The location of the event became the object of a pilgrimage, and the local landowner Otto Jastrzƒôbczyk decided to build a wooden church, in which the figure was placed. On 8 September, 1700, the statue was transferred to the parish church in WƒÖwolnica after the superior of the Benedictines from the Basilica of the Holy Cross (Bazylika mniejsza pw. Tr√≥jcy ≈öwiƒôtej), Father Chrystyn Mirecki, obtained permission from Pope Clement XII. This was because the old church was falling apart, it had insufficient capacity in relation to the needs of an expanding cult, and the need for greater custody for the miraculous statue. The figurine was placed on the altar, while the church was demolished in Kƒôb≈Ço. In modern times, only the chancel remained from the original 14th-century church, rebuilt in the Renaissance style to the chapel, which is now the sanctuary of Our Lady.

Incident  Sarfaraz Shah was shot by members of the Sindh branch of the Pakistan Rangers in Karachi in 2011. The incident was recorded by a local television cameraman, Abdul Salam Somroo. After the channel he worked for, Samaa TV, refused to air the footage, Somroo had the footage broadcast on another Pakistani national channel. After the footage of the incident spread, other media companies, national and international, aired the footage as well. The cameraman left Karachi with his family after receiving numerous threats. The video shows Sarfaraz Shah in a black T-shirt being dragged by his hair in a public park by a man in plain clothes. He was then pushed towards a group of uniformed Rangers disembarking from a pick-up truck, one of them approaching him aggressively, armed with G3 battle rifles. Shah, who did not appear to be armed, pleaded for his life as one of the Rangers pointed a gun at his neck. The Ranger then shot him twice at close range with the rifle and hit him in the thigh and arm. Shah can be seen writhing on the ground, screaming in pain, bleeding heavily, and begging for help as the video ends (he is not taken to hospital by the rangers). He died of blood loss.  Aftermath  Shortly after the incident it was not clear who made the video, which led to some reports suggesting that the cameraman had gone into hiding. The incident sparked public outcry, especially in Shah's local area, with some politicians calling for the Rangers involved to be prosecuted. The Rangers and park employees alleged that the young man had been caught trying to rob someone, which Shah's family denies. His brother, Salik Shah, said Sarfaraz had been the victim of an extrajudicial killing, saying \\"My innocent brother has been killed brutally by the Rangers.\\" and \\"What harm has he inflicted on anybody? His crime was that he was just strolling in the public park because there was no power in the house.\\" A later investigation revealed that a toy gun was recovered from the victim. The whole episode was also recorded incidentally by the crew of a Sindhi TV channel, Awaz Television Network. They were at the Benazir Shaheed Public Park, Clifton near the American Consulate in Karachi, at around 17:30 pm, recording their program \\"Walk & Talk\\". Someone claimed to be a security guard at the park and brought Shah to the Rangers who drove a white-coloured vehicle numbered 1543. The Rangers appeared to be 'hyper', and their physical and mental condition could not be ascertained by an independent medical examination, as they were taken into 'protective' custody by their own comrades. They were handed over to the Police after 2 days, by which time it was no longer possible to examine the mental state of the Rangers at the time of the incident. Ali Dayan Hasan, the Pakistani researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the killing \\"provides chilling evidence of the abusive, trigger-happy practices of Pakistan's military, paramilitary and civilian agencies\\". Ajaz Chaudhry of the DG Rangers claimed that an inquiry would be underway and those responsible would be brought to justice. Iftakhar Ahmad Chouhdary, the chief Justice of Pakistan, transferred the case to the court of anti-terrorism. Also shortly after the incident, the chief of the Sindh Rangers, Fayaaz Leghari, was fired from his post by the Pakistani Government on orders of the Supreme Court. The chief Inspector General of the Sindh Police who allegedly misconducted the investigation was also fired from his post. Shahid Zafar, the Ranger who shot Salfaraz Shah, was convicted of murder in the Sindh High Court where he was later sentenced to death after being found guilty of the offence. The Ranger and his lawyer later appealed the verdict in the Supreme Court of Pakistan which upheld the death sentence against the accused upon reviewing the case, while punishments for others involved were adjusted. The Government authorities has petitioned the President of Pakistan for pardon for all the accused under the Article 45 of the Constitution. It was reported in some sections of the media that the pardon has been granted, but was refuted by the President's office.

The building that contains the library and the Grundy Art Gallery has been designated a Grade II listed building by English Heritage. History In 1908, a site was picked for a new library and art gallery on Queen Street. It was partly financed by Bury artists Cuthbert and John Grundy. Construction started on the building in 1909, and it was completed in 1911. It was designed by Scottish architecture firm Cullen, Lochhead and Brown, who had won a competition for the project. In August 2010, the library closed to the public to undergo a year-long renovation that cost ¬£3 million. It reopened on 26 September 2011. The Library celebrated its centenary on 26 October 2011. Architecture The library is in the Edwardian Baroque style. It is on two storeys and is constructed of red brick with stone dressings and striped pilasters. The library occupies the corner part of the building; the west and south walls have flanking pylons on plinths made of stone. The corner entrance is flanked by three ionic columns on each side. Over the doorway is a large, rectangular window, and above that, a frieze carved with the words \\"\\". At the top, there is an octagonal leaded dome, which has a finial shaped like an urn.

It entered service in 1939 flying trans-Pacific routes. Like other long range Clipper aircraft in Pan-Am it aided US military during World War II. In service with the US Navy it made a forced landing 650 miles east of Oahu on 3 November 1945 and when the subsequent salvage attempt was abandoned, the Honolulu Clipper was deliberately sunk by gunfire. Passengers flying aboard the aircraft over its service life of 18,000 flying hours included Clare Boothe Luce, Eddie Rickenbacker, Thomas Kinkaid, Chester Nimitz, and Peter Fraser. Prototype Pan Am initiated trans-Pacific airmail service on 22 November 1935; and began carrying passengers in October 1936. Pan Am requested Boeing to design a longer range flying boat to improve service offered by the original Martin M-130s; and Boeing completed NX18601 with the canceled Boeing XB-15 wing design and a single vertical tail fin on 1 June 1938. A twin rudder tail was substituted after the initial test pilot reported adjusting engine power was the only way to turn the aircraft; and that was subsequently replaced with the triple tail used on production aircraft. Boeing also modified the hull-step and sponsons to provide satisfactory performance during takeoff and landings. Service history thumb290px Model Honolulu Clipper, still in the experimental phase (identified as NX-18601) and which would be operated by Pan American Airways with registration NC-18601, until it crashed on November 3, 1945. Pan Am accepted the modified prototype to replace Hawaii Clipper. The plane's first trans-Pacific flight as NC18601 began on 16 March 1939. The plane set a record at the time by carrying 45 persons, including thirty paying passengers, on the final leg of the trip from Manila to Hong Kong. Pan Am purchased five more production Boeing 314s and three improved Boeing 314As to extend transoceanic service to the Atlantic. Pan Am hired experienced nautical navigators for oceanic flights. These men continued to fly the aircraft after the United States Navy assumed control of the Clippers in 1942. Honolulu Clipper flew between California and Hawaii and to Australia via Canton Island, Fiji, Noum√©a and New Zealand after Japan gained control of the pre-war Pan Am facilities at Wake Island, Guam and Manila Bay. Pan Am crews maintained a unique line-crossing ceremony flying to New Zealand and Australia. Passengers crossing the equator for the first time provided a banknote to be endorsed by those who had made the passage before. The endorsed banknote, known as a short snorter, was returned to the initiate as a credential for future crossings. Loss Honolulu Clipper departed Hawaii on 3 November 1945 with an Operation Magic Carpet flight carrying 26 military personnel returning to the United States after service in the Pacific. The aircraft lost power in both starboard engines after five hours of flying, and successfully landed 650 miles east of Oahu shortly before midnight. The merchant tanker Englewood Hills maintained radio contact, found the aircraft and removed the passengers on the morning of 4 November. The escort carrier Manila Bay arrived and sent over aircraft mechanics who were unable to repair the engines at sea. Manila Bay then attempted to tow the aircraft; but the tow line parted as weather deteriorated. The seaplane tender San Pablo was assigned to tow the flying boat into port. The tow proceeded slowly until 7 November when Honolulu Clipper rode down the crest of a wave and smashed into the side of San Pablo. The collision crushed the airplane's bow and sheared off the starboard wingtip. Honolulu Clipper was intentionally sunk on 14 November by perforating the hull with 1200 20mm Oerlikon shells after salvage was deemed impractical.

Biography Of Basque origin, Viana started his military career in 1735 and fought in Italy during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748), reaching the rank of colonel. On his return from that campaign, he was named first governor of Montevideo by King Ferdinand VI of Spain, in 1750, taking office in that city on March 14, 1751. The following month he faced a revolt of the Charruas Indians, who were defeated at the Battle of Tacuar√≠ on 16 April. Viana's appointment took place in the course of certain political circumstances in the R√≠o de la Plata by the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, by which the government of Fernando VI ceded to Portugal the Jesuit missions of upper Uruguay, in exchange for the delivery of Colonia del Sacramento. This fact is part of the second pacifist policy of the Spanish Bourbons, who tried to approach Portugal diplomatically to end the border disputes at various points in the Americas, especially in the R√≠o de la Plata. In compliance with the treaty stipulated above, in January 1752 work began on the new demarcation of the boundary line between the two empires in the area. However, Indians continued to be slaves of the Portuguese farmers who were in need of manpower for agricultural labor in Brazil, leading to a war in 1754 and 1756, called the Guaran√≠ War, in which Spanish and Portuguese together had to deal with indigenous rebels. Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Viana personally shot dead Chief Sep√©. Upon returning, Viana founded the city of Salto, Uruguay in November 1756 and San Fernando de Maldonado, in 1757, which was so named in honor of King Ferdinand VI. During military operations in the Rio de la Plata led by Pedro de Cevallos, in the framework of the Seven Years' War (1762 and 1763), Viana was under the command of the Spanish commander in that victorious campaign for the Spanish arms. In 1764, Viana was replaced by Agust√≠n de la Rosa, who remained in office until 1771 when the governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Jose Vertiz, dismissed him, he sent Viana back to the government of Montevideo. During his second term, Viana issued a series of administrative measures to curb smuggling. In early 1773, he resigned and died shortly afterwards. He was replaced by Joaqu√≠n del Pino.

Life and career Schmid in 2014 Schmid studied Visual Communication at Fachhochschule f√ºr Gestaltung Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd and Berlin University of the Arts from 1976 to 1981. He began his career as a freelance critic and the publisher of Fotokritik, an iconoclastic and original contribution to West German photography. In the pages of Fotokritik and in his regular articles and lectures for other venues, Schmid argued articulately and at times vehemently against prevailing, predominantly conservative notions of 'art photography' and in favour of a broad, encompassing critique of photography as a form of cultural practice. After ceasing publication of Fotokritik in 1987, Schmid focused on his own art production, based primarily on found photography and public image sources. Living near one of the largest flea markets in Berlin, he had already amassed a rich, deep, and varied collection of vernacular photography which formed the raw material for many of his works. Schmid‚Äôs use of extended series reflects his concern with photography as an encompassing, culturally dispersed and ubiquitous social and aesthetic discourse that runs throughout the public and private spheres of modern life. Yet the fundamental richness of Schmid‚Äôs photographic raw material ‚Äì along with the sardonic wit he so often displays ‚Äì derails any attempt to read his work as pure anthropology or social science. His artistic preoccupations reflect a close observation of photographic history and a fascination with photographic images themselves in all their alternately bizarre and conventionalized aspects. Schmid's work has been exhibited internationally and is held in the collections of many major international institutions. In 2007 Photoworks and Steidl published a comprehensive monograph Joachim Schmid Photoworks 1982‚Äì2007 on the occasion of his first retrospective exhibition at The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery in Saratoga Springs, NY. He has published more than one hundred artist's books, and at the end of 2009, Schmid founded the ABC Artists' Books Cooperative, a group of artists dedicated to self-publishing using print-on-demand technology.

The Isuledda (Sardinian for Little Island), also called Isola dei Gabbiani (Italian for Island of Seagulls), is an almost-island in northern Sardinia, Italy, facing the Sardinian channel. Covering an area of approximately 180,000 m¬≤, it is almost completely surrounded by the sea, and connected to the mainland by a narrow isthmus of sandy terrain, hence, despite the name, it is in fact a peninsula. It is situated close to the localit√† of Porto Pollo and Barrabisa. The name \\"Isola dei Gabbiani\\" comes from the name of the camping that occupied the whole surface up to 2008. The area is administered by the comune of Palau. Due to its windy climate, it is a common destination for windsurfers and kitesurfers. The place is particularly favorable to the practice of these sports thanks to the optimal exposition to winds from north-west, which are dominant in the Mediterranean Sea (especially mistral). Geography Isola dei Gabbiani as seen from San Pasquale. The peninsula divides two wide bays: baia di ponente and baia di levante (western and eastern bay respectively). With respect to the mistral, the western bay is upwind of the isthmus, and is characterised by \\"choppy\\" water surface. On the other side, the eastern bay is downwind of the isthmus, close to Porto Pollo, and its flat water condition makes it favoured by freestyle windsurfers.

Soaring Society of America, August 1974. USPS 499-920 The Diamant is noted as the first glider that was built entirely from fiberglass, with no other materials, such as balsa, used as a sandwich. Design and development The initial student prototype design used the wings from a Schleicher Ka 6, but these were replaced on production aircraft with Glasfl√ºgel H-301 wings. FFA started manufacture of the wingspan Diamant HBV model as its first attempt to build a sailplane. The Swiss company had been part of Dornier Flugzeugwerke, but was split off as a separate company after the Second World War and was pursuing new lines of business. FFA built three different models of the Diamant, the HBV, the 16.5, and 18. The early model 16.5 and 18s had issues with structural flutter at high speeds, but this was rectified by FFA for customer aircraft. The HBV and 16.5 were type certified in the United States, while the 18 was in the Experimental - Racing category. The type certificate for the HBV and 16.5 requires that \\"all external portions of the glider exposed to sunlight must be painted white. Registration and Competition numbers must be painted blue-gray, or in any other light colours.\\" Operational history Diamant 18s were entered in the 1968 World Gliding Championships, held in Leszno, Poland and placed third and fourth. Ross Briegleb won the 1970 US Nationals at El Mirage, California flying a Diamant 18. He also set the national speed record for the at . In June 2011 there were still five Diamant HBVs, 20 Diamant 16.5s and five Diamant 18s registered in the United States. Variants ;Diamant HBV :With a wingspan the HBV was designed for the Standard Class. It uses the wings from a Glasfl√ºgel H-301 Libelle and mates them with a fully reclined cockpit and a new T-tailed fuselage. The model also has water ballast and a retractable monowheel landing gear. Thirteen were built before it was replaced in production by the 16.5. Certified by the FAA on 7 June 1967. ;Diamant 16.5 :The 16.5 is named for its wingspan, which placed it in the Open Class at the time of its construction. The aircraft was introduced in 1967, and unlike the HBV, the wings of which were built by Glasfl√ºgel, the 16.5 was entirely built by FFA. It was this model that was the first all-fiberglass sailplane. Forty-three were built. Certified by the FAA on 1 July 1969. ;Diamant 18 :The Diamant 18 is identical to the 16.5, but with a wingspan. The airfoil is a modified Wortmann section designated as the FX 62-K-153m. The wing was extended inboard, with new flap sections added and new wing tip fairings. First flown in 1968, about 30 were built. ;Pierson Diamant 19 :Dan Pierson of Los Angeles, California purchased a Diamant 18 and modified it through a drag-reduction and performance enhancement program, including fairing, reshaping the wingroots and T-tail junction, plus giving it a pointed nose and of water ballast. The landing gear was strengthened for higher gross weights and the wingspan increased to , including aileron extensions. Control configuration was modified to allow new configurations of flaps and drooped ailerons to improve thermalling performance. The resulting aircraft out-performed the unmodified Diamant 18. In 1983 it was reported that Pierson was planning to use the wings for a two- seat glider and build new wings for the existing fuselage. This aircraft was registered with the US Federal Aviation Administration as an experimental.Said, Bob: 1983 Sailplane Directory, Soaring Magazine, page 52. Soaring Society of America, November 1983.

The documentary is written and directed by Stephen K. Bannon. The Undefeated was released on , 2011. Synopsis The film is constructed in three acts. The film opens with a montage. The first act concerns itself with Palin's term as mayor of Wasilla. The second act is about Palin's half term as governor of Alaska. The third act, titled \\"From here, I can see November,\\" revolves around her candidacy for vice-president and her rise to national prominence. It goes into detail how she became the darling of the Tea Party movement. The film ends with clips of the Madison rally where Palin challenged Republicans to: \\"Fight like a girl.\\" The last shot is of Palin saying into the camera, \\"Mr. President, game on!\\" Production Stephen K. Bannon wrote and directed The Undefeated, which was independently financed by Victory Film Group. Sarah Palin was familiar with Bannon because of his Tea Party documentary Generation Zero. After the United States elections in November 2010, when the Republican Party increased their seats in Congress, Palin asked her aide, Rebecca Mansour, to contact Bannon about creating a series of videos to explain Palin's stepping down as Governor of Alaska and to \\"protect her legacy\\" to set up for a potential campaign for the 2012 United States presidential election. Bannon instead decided to produce a feature film about Sarah Palin and provided of his own financing. For the documentary, he interviewed Palin's supporters, including Alaskan residents and conservative bloggers like Andrew Breitbart. While Sarah Palin and her team were not part of the production, they gave Bannon's documentary their blessing. Bannon bought audio rights to Palin's book Going Rogue so he could include clips of Palin's voice in the documentary. While he considered titling the documentary Take a Stand after Palin's campaign slogan during the 2006 Alaska gubernatorial election, he chose The Undefeated as a \\"more triumphant\\" title. Wes Little of CNN describes some of the imagery in the film: \\"Clockwork Orange\\"-esque evocative images sprinkled throughout (shark attacks, bodies being buried, warfare both modern and ancient).\\" Release Arc Entertainment released The Undefeated on , 2011 in AMC theaters in Dallas, Denver, Oklahoma City, Orlando, Atlanta, Orange County, Phoenix, Houston, Indianapolis, and Kansas City. Before the commercial release, the documentary had one-night screenings at select theaters in the states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. On June 17, the movie premiered to attendees of the RightOnline convention in Minneapolis. There are two versions of the documentary: one version rated PG-13 by the MPAA, and an unedited version featuring anti-Palin clips from Rosie O'Donnell, Matt Damon, Bill Maher, David Letterman, Howard Stern and Louis C.K. Reception The Politico reported that professional film critics greeted it with \\"a chorus of boos\\", describing the film as 'biased', 'hagiographic', and \\"propaganda\\". The film currently holds a 0% approval rating on the movie review website Rotten Tomatoes and a 32 out of 100 on the review aggregator Metacritic. John Wilson, creator of the Golden Raspberry Award, said in a pre-screening comment, \\"Sarah Palin is what the Razzies are all about.\\" New York Post critic Kyle Smith described the film as \\"massively flawed\\", and said, \\"I don't know why Sarah Palin called her movie 'The Undefeated'. She lost the vice presidency, she quit the governorship of Alaska and she cut her bus tour short. The title makes no sense. Time critic Richard Corliss, who panned the film, stated \\"Bannon applies so much idolatrous airbrushing to his portrait of the divine Sarah that the movie might be called Going Rouge. But he is canny in identifying the 2¬Ω-year governor of Alaska as both a faultless heroine and, even better, a victim of the omnipotent American left... in Bannon's version of things, Palin fights the good fight, beats the fat cats and trumpets the pioneer independence of Alaskans from the predatory federal government ‚Äî a government that, by the way, returns $1.84 in aid to the state for every dollar it sends to Washington...\\" The film was given a limited theatrical release in ten AMC theaters located in areas with strong Tea Party support, and was received positively there, Victory Film Group reported that the film averaged $5,000 per screen in the first two days of release. The Undefeated grossed $60,000-75,000, averaging $6,000 to $7,500 per screen. In larger markets, the film surpassed $10,000 per screen, and at least one theater played the film on two screens to meet demand. However, by the second week of release box office revenue declined by 63% despite a 40% increase in theaters showing the film, with a total gross of only $24,000. Palin announced she would not run for president on October 5, 2011, shortly before the film's DVD release. Conservative political commentators generally praised the film. Tony Lee wrote in Human Events that Undefeated will \\"reaffirm what Palin supporters like about her while presenting a solid case to those who may be on the fence about Palin that she cannot only be a strong executive but that she can and has had a history of winning over independents.\\" He found the pivotal moment in the movie was when Mark Levin compared Palin to Ronald Reagan noting that Palin and Reagan share the same type of detractors.

Purported signs and symptoms According to some authors, PRS symptoms have common characteristics with other psychiatric disorders, but (according to these authors), current psychiatric classification schemes, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders cannot account for the full scope of symptoms seen in PRS. Purported symptoms include partial or complete refusal to eat, move, talk, or care for oneself; active and angry resistance to acts of help and support; social withdrawal; and school refusal. Hypothesized causes Trauma might be a causal factor because PRS is repeatedly seen in refugees and witnesses to violence. Viral infections might be a risk factor for PRS. Mechanism Some authors hypothesize that learned helplessness is one of the mechanisms involved in PRS. A number of cases have been reported in the context of eating disorders.

The population as of the 2010 Census was 813.Virginia Trend Report 2: State and Complete Places (Sub-state 2010 Census Data). Missouri Census Data Center. Accessed 2011-06-08. It was built beginning in 1960 as a resort community around a man-made lake, Lake Louisa.  History  The land encompassing Blue Ridge Shores (BRS) was originally part of the estate of Thomas Ellis, whose vast holdings by 1800 included a mill, cobbler's shop, wheelwright, blacksmith shop, general store, and boasted an efficient stage coach line to such destinations as Orange Springs and the University of Virginia. The idea of creating a recreational and retirement development originated with Dr. I.E. Byrd, an educator from Washington, D.C. He bought over 700 acres of land and planned an elaborate complex consisting of a hotel, golf course, shopping and dining facilities and well as an area for vacationers. His dreams were larger than his funds, however, he was forced to abandon the project. He sold the property by 1958 to the American Realty Corporation and within a year Blue Ridge Shores, Inc. (not to be confused with Blue Ridge Shores Property Owners Association) was formed. By 1960 the first dam was built filling the lake, an office and a few cottages were built, and than advertising campaign started. In April 1960 the present Blue Ridge Property Owners Association (BRPOA) was established with a three-person Board of Directors, the first act in the long process of disassociation from the realty company and becoming an independent community. By 1963 control of the development was turned over to the new association by American Realty. Many problems faced the fledgling community as they established a dues structure, repaired existing buildings and docks, and staffed administration and management positions. August 1969 brought hurricane Camille that nearly destroyed the development. Eleven inches of rain fell in a twelve-hour period. The dam collapsed draining the lake. The Board of Directors immediately took steps to rebuild the dam, set up a fund to finance the project, and reassure residents about the future of the development. The new dam was completed and dedicated on Memorial Day, 1970. Two years later, Hurricane Agnes severely damaged the spillway. The lake was lowered and repairs were made.

Laurens was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2004. Within two years he began competing for the Great Britain para dressage team. He won the National Grade III Disabled Dressage title in 2006 and 2007 and also won both team and individual freestyle golds at the 2007 World Para Championships. Selected to compete at his first Paralympic Games in 2008, Laurens entered the individual freestyle test grade III and was part of the Great Britain quartet for the overall team championship. Competing on his horse Ocean Diamond he won the silver medal in the individual event behind Hannelore Brenner of Germany. In the team open Laurens, with teammates Lee Pearson, Anne Dunham and Sophie Christiansen won the gold medal. This meant that Great Britain has won a gold medal in that event at four consecutive Games. Following his success in Beijing he was named the BBC South West Disabled Sports Personality of the year for 2008. In 2009 Laurens won three medals at the European Championships held in Kristiansand, Norway, and was one six people whose efforts were recognised with the award of a medal of honour for \\"activities connected with international endeavour in relation to equestrian sport\\".

There are 1,355 counties in Mainland China out of a total of 2,851 county-level divisions. The term xian is usually translated as \\"districts\\" or \\"prefectures\\" when put in the context of Chinese history. This article, however, will try to keep the terminology consistent with the modern translation and use the term \\"county\\" throughout, though this is not conventional practice in Sinology literature.  History  Xian have existed since the Warring States period and were set up nationwide by the Qin Dynasty. The number of counties in China proper gradually increased from dynasty to dynasty. As Qin Shi Huang reorganized the counties after his unification, there were about 1,000. Under the Eastern Han Dynasty, the number of counties increased to above 1,000. About 1400 existed when the Sui dynasty abolished the commandery level (ÈÉ° j√πn), which was the level just above counties, and demoted some commanderies to counties. The current number of counties mostly resembled that of the later years of Qing Dynasty. Changes of location and names of counties in Chinese history have been a major field of research in Chinese historical geography, especially from the 1960s to the 1980s. In Imperial China, the county was a significant administrative unit because it marked the lowest level of the imperial bureaucratic structure; in other words, it was the lowest level that the government reached. Government below the county level was often undertaken through informal non-bureaucratic means, varying between dynasties. The head of a county was the magistrate, who oversaw both the day-to-day operations of the county as well as civil and criminal cases.  Autonomous counties  Autonomous counties () are a special class of counties in Mainland China reserved for non-Han Chinese ethnic minorities. Autonomous counties are found all over China, and are given, by law, more legislative power than regular counties. There are 117 autonomous counties in Mainland China.  Government  As the Communist Party of China is central to directing government policy in Mainland China, every level of administrative division has a local CPC Committee. A county's is called the CPC County Committee () and the head called the Secretary (), the de facto highest office of the county. Policies are carried out via the People's government of the county, and its head is called the County Governor (). The governor is often also one of the deputy secretaries in the CPC Committee.

He was a former hairdresser from Hartlepool, County Durham, England. Ward believed he should not sell his material directly or allow unsupervised research due to the potential for reverse engineering, and he maintained that he should keep 51% ownership of the formula for Starlite because he valued the material to be worth billions; this is believed to have stunted its commercial success. Starlite is considered by many to be a lost invention, a technology which might have revolutionised the world of aerospace and materials science. Thermashield, LLC claims to have purchased the secret formula and all rights from Maurice's widow Eileen in 2013. Biography Maurice Ward worked as a hairdresser during the 1960s, and he took pride in his work. He once said in an interview, \\"What L'Oreal and Garnier are doing today, I was doing 50 years ago.

He was a tinkerer, and liked to invent things in his spare time. This hobby led to him purchasing an extruder from ICI during the early 1980s.

The material that Ward extruded was a failure, and it was granulated and forgotten about, until the aforementioned air crash, at which point Ward became inspired. \\"It interested me because it was an air disaster on the ground, and because it was the smoke and toxicity that killed people, not the fire. Fifty-five people died in 40 seconds. We thought we'd like to find something that doesn't burn very much, that would be useful.\\", Ward mentioned in an interview. He began to try to mix different formulations of heat-resistant, non-toxic plastics, which he casually referred to as \\"Gubbins.\\" He was highly productive in this, mixing up to 20 formulations a day. Eventually, he produced a formulation that seemed promising, and used the extruder he had bought years before to make it into sheets. He tested it with a blowtorch, and it dissipated the heat perfectly. This is the material that became known as Starlite. This invention gained much publicity in the 1990s, after he was featured on the British television series Tomorrow's World, holding a blowtorch directly to an egg that had been coated in Starlite. After five minutes under direct contact with the flame, the egg was cracked open, revealing a completely raw egg inside. The invention worked so well that the egg had not even begun to cook.

The anime was aired across Japan on Fuji TV Sundays at 6 p.m. from 4 October 1981 to 26 December 1982. In Japan, it was one of Tatsunoko's most successful shows of the 1980s in terms of ratings, regularly scoring around 15-20%, but it achieved even greater success when it was adapted for the Italian TV market in 1983 under the title Gigi la Trottola. Due to the anime's success in Italy, the complete manga was also released there (keeping the original Japanese title and character names) in 2001. Italian dubbed version of the anime also aired in Poland in the early 90s with Polish voice-over, where it was known under its Italian name. The anime also became a hit in two separate Spanish dubs, one aired in Spain and the other in Latin America, both titled Chicho Terremoto. The anime was very successful in Spain and in Italy. Story The hero of the story is Kappei Sakamoto, a high school student with amazing athletic abilities who joins the basketball team of Seirin High School and quickly becomes one of the most skilled players. Kappei has one unusual handicap for a basketball player - his height; he stands not even one meter tall. His Achilles' heel is female undergarments; he has a particular interest in white panties, and is even more enthusiastic about joining the basketball team when he discovers that the team's female coach, Coach Natsu, wears white panties (although his inventive attempts to sneak a peek at said panties usually result in a physical beatdown from the hot-tempered coach). Eventually, Kappei's athletic prowess extends beyond basketball, and he tries out for - and excels at - every sport the school offers. In the first episode, Kappei meets and becomes enamored with Akane Aki, a sweet, pretty girl who is quite athletic herself (she later joins the school's ping-pong team) and signs on as assistant coach of Seirin's basketball team. Much to Kappei's delight, not only is Akane pretty, but she also wears white panties, and Kappei sets his sights on winning her heart. Kappei eventually moves in with Akane and her family after his parents (who are rarely around) leave for the United States. However, Kappei has an unusual rival for Akane's heart - Akane's dog, Seiichiro, who has often fantasized about marrying his owner and, resenting Kappei, immediately seeks to sabotage his relationship with Akane through various tricks. Seiichiro can also speak, although only Kappei can understand him. Characters * Kappei Sakamoto (ÂùÇÊú¨ ÂãùÂπ≥, Sakamoto Kappei) - The protagonist of the story. Not only he excels in basketball, he also excels in every sport and loves to be in the spotlight, especially when he is admired by the girls. He is obsessed with white women's panties, for him a \\"symbol of purity.\\" Falls in love with the beautiful Akane, and wants to marry her. He is voiced by Mayumi Tanaka in the anime, and is known as Gigi Sullivan in the Italian and Latin American versions and Chicho Terremoto in the Spanish version. * Akane Aki (Áßã „ÅÇ„Åã„Å≠, Aki Akane) - Pretty, sweet, popular, and even- tempered, Akane-chan, a transfer student to Seirin High, becomes the assistant coach of the school's basketball team.

He is also enamored of Akane and dreams of marrying her (despite the fact that she is human and he a dog) and, resenting Kappei's muscling his way into her life, becomes Kappei's sworn enemy, but also his best friend. He often appears in brief entr'actes to explain the rules of whatever sport Kappei happens to be playing at that time. Seiichiro is voiced by Toru Ohira in the anime and is known as Salomone in the Italian version and Bobby in the Spanish dub. * Coach Kaori Natsu (Â§è „Åã„Åä„Çä, Natsu Kaori) - The basketball team's hot-tempered coach.

She emigrated to Canada in 1921 with her father, Leone Caetani, and her mother, Ofelia Fabiani. Leone, an Italian nobleman (Prince of Teano and Duke of Sermoneta), brought his second family to Canada due to irreconcilable differences in philosophy ‚Äî he was a radical socialist and the regime in Italy was fascist.http://www.heidithompson.ca/sveva.htmSveva's father, Leone Caetani Duke of Sermoneta, was a distinguished scholar and a Socialist Deputy of the Italian parliament. In Italy between the two World Wars he sensed the growing power of Fascism and decided that Canada would provide a more liberal and healthy environment for himself, his common-law wife, Ofelia, and his daughter Sveva Biography Of Italian, English, French, Spanish, and Polish descent, Sveva Ersilia Giovanella Maria Fabiani was born in Rome.Full birth name given in Charles Quest-Ritson, Ninfa: The Most Romantic Garden in the World (Frances Lincoln, 2009), page 31 Her father, Leone Caetani, Prince of Teano (he became 15th Duke of Sermoneta shortly after her birth), was already married, to Princess Vittoria Colonna Caetani, and would remain so until his death. Her mother was his mistress, Ofelia Fabiani, daughter of a wealthy engineer in Rome. She had one half-sibling by her father's marriage, a brother, Onorato, 16th Duke of Sermoneta, but lived with disabilities. Sveva bore her mother's surname, per Italian law, though it was changed to Caetani later in her childhood in Canada.Change of surname cited in Charles Quest-Ritson, Ninfa: The Most Romantic Garden in the World (Frances Lincoln, 2009), page 31Change of surname cited in Marella Caracciolo Chia, The Light in Between (Pushkin Press, 2010), page 181 Though she spent her first years at Villa Miraggio, a five-story mansion built by her father on the Janiculum Hill in Rome, her parents left Italy to settle in Canada in the town of Vernon, British Columbia in 1921.Marella Caracciolo Chia, The Light in Between (Pushkin Press, 2010), page 181 There the duke purchased a late-19th-century wood house in the neighbourhood of East Hill.http://memorybc.ca/sveva-caetani-fonds;radSveva first arrived in Vernon, B.C. in June, 1921. Oblivious to the political and personal motivations which may have compelled her parents to leave their homeland, Sveva's childhood was one of wealth and privilege. Sheltered in their large house on Pleasant Valley Road,... As her father wrote to a friend about the move, \\"This is not an abandonment of my country and my affairs but a return to simple nature, to a primitive life, a longing for peace and rest after the torment of war and the post-war period. A spiritual rest ...\\"Quote cited in Marella Caracciolo Chia, The Light in Between (Pushkin Press, 2010), page 181 Sveva was educated by private tutors and governesses, as well as Crofton House School in Vancouver.http://memorybc.ca/sveva-caetani- fonds;radSveva's childhood was one of wealth and privilege. Sheltered in their large house on Pleasant Valley Road, Sveva's early education was conducted by tutors and English governesses who lived with and accompanied the Caetani family wherever they travelled.http://memorybc.ca/sveva-caetani-fonds;rad During the first 10 years after arriving in Canada, the Caetani family frequently commuted back and forth between Canada and Europe, largely because Ofelia \\"found Canadian life rather too simple for her cosmopolitan tastes ...\\"Quote from Charles Quest-Ritson, Ninfa: The Most Romantic Garden in the World (Frances Lincoln, 2009), page 31 Combining business with pleasure, the family's trips to Europe included visits to friends and relatives and stops at various real estate holdings. It was through this exceptional education that Sveva learned a love of art.http://memorybc.ca/sveva-caetani-fonds;radIt was during the family's trip to Monte Carlo in 1929-1930, that Sveva was given private instructions in painting and drawing. Sveva shared a close and loving relationship with her father, as well as a deep intellectual bond - a love of history and literature. During her childhood, Leone encouraged Sveva to read and write, to paint, and experience life.http://www.vernonpublicartgallery.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=65&Itemid;=73For instance, while the family were vacationing in Monte Carlo in 1929, Russian artist Andre Petroff imposed a rigorous daily schedule which involved Sveva drawing from a live model and painting still lifes on canvas. In Paris, Sveva attended the Academie Ranson for six months between 1929-1930, where she was exposed to the work of Modernist painters, namely the Nabis. These important individuals were to instil in Sveva a level of artistic self-discipline and dedication that she would maintain her entire life. The Duke of Sermoneta lost much of his fortune in 1929, and when he died of throat cancer in 1935, Sveva's life changed dramatically. Her mother became mentally and physically ill, and it was at this time that Ofelia Fabiani began demanding Sveva stay at home, avoiding all contact with the outside world.http://www.caetaniculturalcentre.org/caetani.htmlLife became difficult for eighteen-year-old Sveva after the death of her father from cancer in 1934. Her mother Ofelia suffered both physically and mentally from the loss and chose a reclusive life, forcing Sveva to join her. Her mother was so distressed that she would suffer severe physical ailments, such as heart palpitations, whenever Sveva would leave.http://www.artistsincanada.com/php/article.php?id=746Each time Sveva endeavored to leave, her mother would suffer severe heart palpitations and anxiety. After a brief period where her mother permitted Sveva's artistic pursuitshttp://www.vernonpublicartgallery.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=65&Itemid;=73Initially, Sveva was permitted to write and paint, producing in the 1940s a series of small paintings that were primarily religious in content, with titles such as 'Carpenter Christ' and 'Virgin Mary at the Cross'. However, Ofelia became increasingly threatened by her daughter's artistic output until she forbade it altogether. Sveva later recounted, 'in order to have peace I gave it up for fifteen years it was like death in life'. Sveva was not allowed to engage in making artwork, and for the years she remained captive in the family home, books were virtually her only connection to the outside world.http://www.caetaniculturalcentre.org/caetani.htmlSveva was not allowed to leave the house at first, but after a time, she was allowed to walk around the garden and eventually into town for banking. Sveva was effectively housebound from 1935 until 1960 when her mother passed away. In 1960 her mother died, leaving Sveva to pursue both independence and her artistic pursuits. After completing her teaching degree, she served the local area as an art instructor at Lumby's Charles Bloom Secondary.http://www.caetaniculturalcentre.org/caetani.htmlIt was only after Ofelia's death that Sveva was free to pursue her own interests. Rejoining the community, she earned her teaching degree at the University of Victoria and went on to instruct Visual Arts at Charles Bloom Secondary School in Lumby. However, that wasn't the end of her contributions, as Sveva began painting a series of 56 watercolours intended to reflect her life. This series was titled \\"Recapitulation\\".http://www.vernonpublicartgallery.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=65&Itemid;=73While driving to work one morning in 1975, Sveva was struck with an idea that would consume her for the next fourteen years. She conceived of a project that would recount the story of her life, with the figure of her father playing a major role. Drawing on Dante's Divine Comedy as a model for the overarching format, an outline began to formulate in her mind. She would call the series Recapitulation. By 1983, it was clear that Sveva could not continue teaching because of her ill health and she was forced to retire. Sveva would spend the next seven years deeply engrossed in producing the fifty-six paintings for Recapitulation, despite her failing health.http://www.caetaniculturalcentre.org/caetani.htmlShortly before her retirement from teaching, she began painting the Recapitulation series. In the latter years of her life, she became ill and used a wheelchair. Nevertheless, she continued painting until the series was completed. With the assistance of Keith and Vanessa Alexander and the Government of Alberta, and when she could not find a B.C. gallery or curator to adopt her Recapitulation series, Sveva donated the complete series of 56 paintings to The Alberta Foundation for the Arts. Works * Recapitulation, 1989 Legacy Sveva's Recapitulation series was bequeathed to the Alberta Foundation for the Arts, and her remaining paintings and her estate were donated to the City of Vernon upon her death in 1994.http://www.caetaniculturalcentre.org/caetani.htmlSveva Caetani passed away on April 24, 1994. She bequeathed the Caetani House and grounds to the City of Vernon in her Will, with the wish that they be utilized for the benefit of the residents of Vernon and the surrounding area for use in all artistic pursuits. Sveva Caetani's image is depicted in downtown Vernon along with her family in a mural painted by Michelle Loughery.http://www.1075kiss.com/local-first/kiss-news/3196-caetani-mural- dedicated?fontstyle=f-largerThe Captive Artist'--on the side of the Culos building at 3006 32nd Ave--celebrates the life of Vernon artist Sveva Caetani, who died in 1994.

History  American businessman, Dr. Munr Kazmir, who was born in Pakistan, founded the American International School System in 2006.Sunita Sohrabji, Seven S. Asians Honored with Ellis Island Awards, indiawest.com, April 21, 2011 Construction began later that year on 11.5 acres of land in Hurbanspura, purchased from the Government of Punjab. The school was launched in 2007 with just seven pre- school and kindergarten students. Today, there are one hundred and twenty-five students from pre-school through eighth grade. Enrollment is expected to grow to 1,200 students by 2016.  Curriculum and teaching  The school's curriculum is based entirely on the U.S. curriculum model and taught in English, however Urdu and Islamiat classes are provided due to the Ministry of Education's requirement.City 42 News, American International School System offers an American Curriculum in Pakistan, May 9, 2009 The school is in the process of being accredited by Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. AISS brings certified teachers from the U.S. who follow American standards of education. The school also recruits teachers from the U.S. as visiting instructors. These guest teachers observe classroom instruction and provide feedback on the curriculum and teaching practices. The George Washington University (GWU), School of Human Development and Education has partnered with AISS to make available a comprehensive professional development program for faculty, and has created a sophisticated curriculum ranging from literacy, conflict resolution, and peace-studies. Five courses upgrade faculty content knowledge and instructional expertise, develop capacity in the use of interactive technology, and establish professional collaborations with U.S. faculty. GWU Professor Judy Findlay leads the program.  Campus and facilities  The school building was designed by Mr. Zeeshan of Lahore and resembles a crescent, depicting Pakistan‚Äôs Islamic heritage. With a $10.2 million investment including a $2.5 loan from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), AISS built one of the most modern and state-of-the-art campuses in Pakistan. The campus contains an amphitheater, swimming pool, cafeteria, a hi-tech auditorium, libraries, a main computer lab and computers in all classrooms. AISS is the first Pakistani educational institution to be handicap accessible. In addition to classroom education, the facilities are used for other advanced educational and civic activities sponsored by the school, which includes basic and advanced teacher training and mentoring programs for children and adults. Civic activities include community outreach and the use of the facility as a community center.  Financial support and foundation  With over 87% of its students attending on scholarship, the school relies on the American International School System Foundation financially. The AISS Foundation is a U.S. non-profit 501(c)(3) that supports student scholarships and financial assistance to support AISS for its academic programs and facilities. The Foundation also creates programs and services that foster a favorable image of the United States, increase understanding between the people of the United States and the Muslim world, and train independent thinkers to stand up against violence and extremism. The American, AISS and Pakistan flags greet visitors at the school.  Notable support and visitors  On August 25, 2010, Senators Joe Lieberman, John McCain, Ben Cardin and Kirsten Gillibrand co-signed a letter to Mian Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif, the Chief Minister of Punjab, in support of the school. In the letter they stated, \\"We believe that this school represents an extremely important educational initiative and a critical bond of friendship between the United States and Pakistan.\\" On April 28, 2009, Senators Joe Lieberman, and Congressmembers Donald Payne, Steve Rothman, Gary Ackerman, Carolyn Maloney, Scott Garrett, and Joseph Crowley co-signed a letter to Yousaf Raza Gilani, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, thanking him for his support of AISS.

Most Gallet Clamshell chronographs measure 34.2 millimeters in diameter (not measuring the winding crown) by approximately 42 millimeters in overall length, with a few smaller and larger examples released during the 1940s. The Clamshell's 15-year history began in 1936 when Gallet purchased the rights to a patent for the \\"waterproof\\" watch case design (Brevet N¬∞ 189190), invented by the Swiss firm of Schmitz Fr√®res & Cie in the neighboring city of Grenchen. By inserting gasket sealed pushbuttons into the side of this unique watch case design, Gallet was able to expand the water resistant characteristics of the Schmitz Fr√®res concept to the more complex wrist-worn chronograph. Originally engineered by Gallet for the adverse conditions of the battlefield, the Clamshell chronograph derived its nickname from the way that the upper and lower sections of the watch case compressed together over a specially flared crystal, protecting the delicate inner mechanisms from the intrusion of water, dirt, dust, and caustic chemicals. The \\"waterproof\\" Clamshell filled such a critical void in the area of military, industrial, and sports related timekeeping that its popularity helped Gallet's overall sales of wrist-worn watches and hand-held timers exceed 100,000 units per year for over 15 years. Gallet also supplied privately labeled versions of its Clamshell chronograph to other watch companies, as well as retailers that included C. Bucherer of Lucerne, T√ºrler in Zurich, Tiffany & Co. of New York, and T. Eaton of Canada. In spite of the Clamshell's effectiveness at preventing water intrusion to a submerged depth of over 100 meters, it was eventually replaced by more easily serviceable versions with full screw-on case backs and readily available generic crystals. Clamshell Dials During the 15 years of the Clamshell's production, numerous dial or face variations were released. Styles ranged from basic military specification black to more exotic two-toned and multicolored versions with tachymeter, telemeter chronograph, and heart rate indications.Gerd R. Lang and Reinhard Meis, Chronograph Wristwatches to Stop Time, (Schiffer) Germany 1993 A relatively small number were released with luminous numbers, accompanied by radium-filled minute, hour, and sweep second hands for low-light conditions. The Gallet Clamshell is a popular item for collectors of vintage timepieces with examples trading from $1000 to over $10,000. Current market values for classic Clamshells are based on a number of factors, the most important being the style and condition of the dial (face). An example with a non-original restored or refinished dial can lose between 25 and 40% of its value, while a Clamshell with an exotic original dial will command a premium. Original dials alone often trade in the hundreds with a few unusual styles selling for over $1000. Due to the effectiveness of the Clamshell's water resistant case at protecting the watch's inner mechanism against the elements, vintage examples occasionally appear on the market and at auction in fully functional condition, often with non-degraded original dials. Two early Gallet Clamshells are on permanent display at the National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia, Pennsylvania. Related Watches A particularly desirable \\"Clamshell\\" style wrist watch with collectors is Gallet's very first series of Flight Officer Chronographs with rotating bezel for multiple time zone calculation. Built around the waterproof design of the MultiChron 30 Clamshell, the Flight Officer's two-tone dial, printed with the world's major cities and inner telemetry scale, is rumored to have been designed in part by 33rd US president Harry S Truman while still a senator.http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/nwcm-62500-Presidential- Timepieces-Exhibit-pres-exhib-flas-Education-ppt-powerpoint/ The Flight Officer chronograph worn by Truman is now housed within the collection of the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum. Whether or not the Truman Flight Officer should be designated as a Clamshell has been a long-standing argument among collectors. While most timekeeping historians and purist collectors feel that only the waterproof version of the early MultiChron model 30 should have this designation, a few site the shared compression case design of the two watches as possible justification for the early Flight Officer's inclusion into the Clamshell category. The fact that the Flight Officer only utilized the Clamshell style water protection system for the first decade of the watch's seven decades of production appears to support the former argument. This is further reinforced by the Gallet Company's distinctly separate nomenclature for these two different watch models. This argument also arises in regards to the MultiChron Pilot Petite as well as Gallet's early time-only waterproof watches, since these two additional model groups also utilized the 4 screw Clamshell compression system for a brief period during the early 1940s.

The History of Louisiana Tech University began when the Industrial Institute and College of Louisiana was founded in Ruston, Louisiana in 1894. The institute was founded to develop an industrial economy in the state of Louisiana. Four years later, the school was renamed the Louisiana Industrial Institute when Louisiana adopted the Constitution of 1898. When the Constitution of 1921 was passed, the school changed its name again to Louisiana Polytechnic Institute to reflect the school's evolution from a trade school into a larger and broader technical institute. Although the university was informally called Louisiana Tech for about five decades after the 1921 name change, it was not until 1970 when Louisiana Polytechnic Institute officially changed its name to Louisiana Tech University. Over the course of its history, the school grew from a small industrial institute with one building to a university with five colleges and an enrollment of around 11,800 students. Establishment of the University After the end of Reconstruction in Louisiana in 1877, the only two notable universities in the state were Tulane University and Louisiana State University (LSU). A few small colleges populated the rural areas of north Louisiana, such as Mount Lebanon University in Mount Lebanon, Keatchie Female College in Keachi, and Ruston College. The Louisiana state government began to support the creation of higher education colleges and universities across the state including the establishment of Southern University in 1880 and Louisiana State Normal School in 1884. On May 14, 1894, one year after a fire destroyed the old Ruston College, the Lincoln Parish Police Jury held a special session to outline plans to establish an industrial institute for Lincoln Parish and to introduce the plans during the upcoming session of the Louisiana State Legislature. The police jury decided at the meeting to move forward with the plans and called upon the local State Representative George M. Lomax to introduce the legislation during the next session. During the legislative session, State Representatives Lomax and J. T. M. Hancock from Jackson Parish, and lawyer and future judge John B. Holstead fought for the passage of the proposed bill. On July 6, 1894, the legislature passed the bill as Act 68 of the General Assembly of Louisiana. The act established The Industrial Institute and College of Louisiana to be located in Ruston, LA. The institute was established \\"for the education of the white children of the State of Louisiana in the arts and sciences\\". The original skills to be taught at the industrial institute included telegraphy, stenography, drawing, industrial applications of designing and engraving, needlework, and bookkeeping. Because the school was the only state college north of Natchitoches, admission standards were lenient. Students who were admitted into the general preparatory class were required to be fourteen years of age and to be able to read, write, speak and spell with \\"tolerable correctness.\\" The Industrial Institute and College of Louisiana named Colonel Arthur T. Prescott as the institute's first president in 1894.Biography of Colonel Prescott Colonel Prescott, the former commandant of the student cadet organization at the University of Virginia, moved to Ruston to oversee the establishment of the industrial institute in Ruston. After the school secured $20,000 from the Louisiana Legislature, Lincoln Parish, and the City of Ruston and twenty acres of land through a donation by Francis P. Stubbs, Prescott led the school's efforts to construct the first buildings on the Tech campus. The first building constructed on the Tech Campus, The Old Main Building, was a two-story brick building that contained eight large classrooms, an auditorium, chemical laboratory, and two offices. Prescott also set aside a reading room in the Old Main Building furnished with tables, chairs, and 125 books donated from his own personal collection to serve as the school's first libraryBeginnings of Prescott Library . A frame building was also built near the Old Main Building to be used for the instruction of mechanics. In 1898, Hale Hall was constructed as a two-story girls dormitory. During Colonel Prescott's five years at the institute, the school's student enrollment grew and the first diplomas were awarded. On September 23, 1895, the school held its first classes with six faculty members and 212 students from 22 parishes. Although there were no classes offered for music studies at first, student demand led to the administration offering courses in piano, voice, and violin. For the 1897‚Äì1898 academic year, the student enrollment grew to 300 students while the faculty expanded to 12 teachers. In the spring of 1897, Colonel Prescott awarded the school's degree to Harry Howard. Harry Howard received a Bachelor of Industry degree after two years of study. Mr. Howard would become an instructor at the college as well as the College Treasurer and the Director of the Business Department for over 25 years. The first graduation ceremony was held in 1898 when ten graduates received their diplomas at the Ruston Opera House. Louisiana Industrial Institute (1898‚Äì1921) Robinson Hall - Named in honor of W.C. Robinson who was a professor of mathematics and for a short time the second president of Louisiana Tech University ( though named Louisiana Industrial Institute at the time.) In 1898, the state of Louisiana passed the Constitution of 1898. Article 256 of the new constitution changed the name of the school from \\"The Industrial Institute and College of Louisiana\\" to the Louisiana Industrial Institute. The following year, Colonel Prescott resigned as the institute's president to return to his alma mater, LSU, where he became a professor of government and the first head of the Government Department. W. C. Robinson, one of the original faculty members in 1894 and a professor of mathematics, succeeded Prescott as President of the Louisiana Industrial Institute in 1899. The Louisiana Industrial Institute suffered in its early years as a result of politics and inadequate financial support from the state government. Although the student enrollment and faculty grew through the first decade of the 1900s, the Louisiana Industrial Institute had frequent changes in its faculty and presidents as a result of low salaries and the state's inadequate support of the school. From 1899 to 1907, the institute installed four presidents. Of the four presidents during the eight-year period, only one, James B. Aswell, served longer than two years. The Ropp Center - Named after president Ralph L. Ropp and constructed in 1911, it is the oldest existing structure on campus. In 1900, the Louisiana Industrial Institute reorganized the academic studies curriculum into two years of preparatory work and three years of college level courses. Students could select the general business course, the mechanical course, or the domestic science course after they completed the two years of preparatory studies. High school graduates were admitted into the third year of studies (first college level year) without examination. By 1905, the minimum age for admission was raised for incoming students. Young ladies had to be at least fifteen years old to enter the First Year. Young men had to be at least sixteen years old to enter the First Year, fifteen years old to enter the Second Year, and fourteen years old to enter the Third Year. By 1909, all young men had to be at least sixteen years old to gain admission to the institute. Student life continued to develop at the school as the student enrollment expanded to over 800 students in the 1904‚Äì1905 school year. About 250 female students lived at the Hale Hall Girls' Dormitory while 125 male students lived at the Boys' Hall. Four literary societies were organized by the higher classes as part of their English studies. The Young Men's Christian Association and the King's Daughters were the two Christian organizations on the campus at that time. The students and faculty assembled at the chapel before the start of each school day for Bible reading, prayer, and singing. Every student was required to attend the Sunday service at the church of their choice and encouraged to attend one of the Sunday School services conducted by the institute's faculty members at one of the local churches. The school also maintained football and baseball teams on the newly purchased athletic field. In 1905, the first edition of The Lagniappe, the school's yearbook, was published. The Mechanic Arts Building was constructed in 1904 following a rapid period of growth of the Mechanical Arts Department. The building would house the Mechanical Arts Department and the School of Engineering until the erection of Bogard Hall in 1940. The Ropp Center, the original President's home, named for president Ralph L. Ropp and the oldest existing structure on the campus, was constructed in 1911. The Italian-style, wood-frame building was the home of Louisiana Tech's presidents for nearly sixty years. Starting in the late 1910s, the Louisiana Industrial Institute started to reorganize some of the degree programs, including engineering. As a result of the changes, bachelor's degrees were offered in the fields of engineering, business administration, education, and home economics. In 1919, the trustees enlarged the curricula and started granting a standard baccalaureate degree. On June 15, 1921, the first bachelor's degree, the Bachelor of Industry in General Engineering, was awarded to a graduate. Change to the Louisiana Polytechnic Institute (1921) The state of Louisiana adopted a new constitution on June 18, 1921. The Constitution of 1921 changed the name of the school from the Louisiana Industrial Institute to Louisiana Polytechnic Institute. After the name change, the institute continued to reorganize its courses of study. In 1926, the curricula of Louisiana Polytechnic Institute was organized into three schools: The School of Education, The School of Engineering, and the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences. =Growing Pains= By the mid-1930s, the institute was beginning to show \\"growing pains\\". Student enrollment grew by almost 60% from 1933 to 1937 while funding from the state increased by only 17% during the same period. The on-campus dormitories and dining hall struggled to meet the needs of the growing student body. The situation was so bad that the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the school's accrediting agency, placed the school on probation in 1937. Among the factors cited by the agency were a high student-teacher ratio, crowded classrooms, library facilities that failed to meet the minimum standards, and a low teaching cost. Additional problems included turning away male students from admission into the agriculture department as a result of inadequate farm facilities and a decrease in the operating budget of the School of Engineering between 1933 and 1937 despite a 268% increase in student enrollment.Louisiana Polytechnic Institute Building Boom After the probation was imposed on the school, the student body and Louisiana Polytechnic Institute President Edwin Richardson sought additional appropriations from the State legislature to expand the infrastructure at the school's campus. The first major construction project on the Tech campus would be the construction of a new administration building to replace \\"Old Main\\". On January 6, 1936, a fire completely destroyed the Old Main Building, the home of the institute's administrative offices and the first building constructed on the Tech campus. The building was completed in 1937 and named after Richard W. Leche, the Governor of Louisiana at the time. Around 1940, the building was renamed Keeny Hall in honor of John Keeny, a former president of the school from 1908 to 1926 who had died the previous year. Another reason for the building's name change was due to Governor Leche having been imprisoned along with a number of state officials in the infamous Louisiana Scandals of 1939. =Building Boom of 1939‚Äì1940= Despite the completion of the Keeny Hall in 1937, Louisiana Polytechnic Institute still faced problems as it tried to fit the growing student body onto the undersized campus. For years, the school lobbied the State Legislature in order to obtain increased funding from the state government. School officials also sought the assistance of the Federal Government through appropriations from the New Deal relief funds. The school's initial proposal was to build twenty new buildings on campus which would have doubled the number of buildings at the school from 20 to 40. Although the initial proposal was scaled back due to high demand for Federal funds, many of the major buildings were approved with about $2,000,000 to be used for the construction of the six campus buildings. The new buildings constructed on the Tech campus between 1938 and 1940 were: Howard Auditorium, a 3,000 seat auditorium and classroom building named after Tech's first graduate Harry Howard; Bogard Hall, the large three-story building for the School of Engineering that marked the first expansion of the engineering school's facilities since 1905; Robinson Hall, a men's dormitory; Tolliver Hall, also known as Toliver Dining Hall, a large dining hall designed to serve 800 students compared to the old dining hall which only seated 250 students; Reese Hall, also known as Reese Agriculture Building, a two-story classroom and lab building for the school of agriculture; and Aswell Hall, a women's dormitory. Most of the new buildings were built in the heart of the old campus in the Colonial Revival style. The only exceptions were Reese Hall which was built on the Tech Farm campus and Howard Auditorium which was a Streamlined Moderne building. In 1936, the Student Government Association was formed as the governing body of the institute's students. Four years later, the Student Union (now the Union Board) were created to build campus spirit, promote a well-rounded campus program, and assure personal development for every Tech student. In 1998, all these buildings were individually added, along with Keeny Hall and the former Prescott Memorial Library (now University Hall), to the National Register of Historical Places as part of \\"The 1930s Building Boom at Louisiana Tech\\" Multiple Resource Area. with a photo and a map.

The Super Famicom version of the game would become the prequel to Koutetsu no Kishi 2: Sabaku no Rommel Shougun and Koutetsu no Kishi 3: Gekitotsu Europe Sensen. There was an expansion pack for the original NEC PC-9801 version titled ; which added a new scenario. Summary The player has to prepare his troops for battle. He does so by researching the map and then assigning the soldiers to their appropriate platoons. The player controls German Waffen-SS and Heer officer who was responsible for commanding troops in major World War II operations like Operation Barbarossa (which are included in the game). Before each mission, a basic summary is given in Japanese in addition to unit strengths, and the locations of major cities. Players must assign a starting location for all of his units and must seek out the AI opponent; who has placed his units according to their historical starting locations. Each mission has the player either invade the enemy, withdraw from an untenable position, or defend occupied territory. The rate of accuracy in combat is entirely dependent on the distance between the opponents along with a degree of luck (to determine whether the bullet penetrates the target for a hit or not). The concept of endurance is completely absent for all units in this game. Cover art (Super Famicom) Players have to in-mission help and the option menu. Attack, defense, and speed statistics are covered for each unit. Like in real history, the game ends after the player is scripted to lose the Battle of Moscow, which saw nearly 1.6 million casualties on both sides of the battle. The player is given a brief message by a man in a motorcycle, then a game over screen appears. The timespan of the Super Famicom version of the game is from June 1941 to September 1943; approximately the duration of Nazi Germany's forward offensive moment in the Eastern Front of World War II. However, the NEC PC-9801 version of the game extends the timespan to March 1945, when the player has to defend the Third Reich from the invading Anglo- American forces.

It is roughly triangular in shape, bounded on the south by the Borman Expressway, on the west by Maryland Street, and on the northeast by the Norfolk Southern railway. It is separated by an industrial corridor from Aetna to its east and Emerson to its north; it directly adjoins the neighborhoods of Midtown and Glen Park. As of 2000, Pulaski's population was 6,777, which was 96.7% African-American, 1.4% white, and 1.3% of Hispanic ethnicity. Pulaski was originally settled by white ethnic millworkers from the 1920s to 1950s. It was one of the first neighborhoods in Gary to be integrated, as upwardly-mobile African-American families moved in from neighboring Midtown in the 1950s. In 1970, the neighborhood's population was 11,825, nearly double what it is today. The neighborhood was the site of Gary's first experiment with urban renewal, beginning in 1963. This experiment caused considerable damage to the community. There is little retail in the neighborhood, apart from a small cluster of shops at 21st and Virginia. The housing stock consists primarily of single-family homes, although there are also several apartment complexes. Pulaski's housing stock has a 96% occupancy rate and a 40% owner-occupancy rate. The neighborhood includes a large subdivision called Marshalltown. There are three elementary schools and a middle school. The neighborhood includes a portion of the Little Calumet River floodplain in its southeastern corner, where there is significant open space. There are also several small community parks. As with many Gary neighborhoods, illegal dumping is a serious problem in disused areas.

It was built in 1913 by William P. Heryford, a local rancher and businessman. The building has changed hands several times over the years, but it has remained in continuous use since it was constructed. Today, the Heryford Building is an active commercial structure for a number of small businesses. Because of its importance to local history, the Heryford Building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  The town of Lakeview was established in 1876. The community grew slowly because of its isolated frontier location. In May 1900, a large fire destroyed 64 of the town's 66 buildings, leaving 700 residents homeless. However most of the homes and business structures were replaced by October of that year. Much of the reconstruction was financed by Doctor Bernard Daly, a local physician, banker, and businessman.\\"\\", National Register of Historic Places Inventory ‚Äì Nomination Form, Statewide Inventory of Historic Sites and Buildings, Oregon State Historic Preservation Office, Salem, Oregon, 21 February 1980.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L.

In 1908, a new county courthouse was built in the center of town on the south side of Center Street (the town's main east-west street) between E Street and F Street (the town's main north-south streets). In 1911, the Nevada‚ÄìCalifornia‚ÄìOregon Railway reached Lakeview, spurring commercial growth in the community. In the two years following the arrival of the railroad, over $200,000 was invested in Lakeview's downtown business area. Almost half of that investment was made by William P. Heryford, a local rancher and businessman. In 1913, Heryford commissioned the construction of a new three-story commercial building on the north side of Center Street, across the street from the Lake County courthouse. Heryford's building cost approximately $100,000 to construct. When it was completed, the building was the largest and most expensive structure in Lakeview. It was also the most modern, with its own power generator, central stream heat, elevators, electric lights, hot water, and telephones.Cooper, Forest E, Introducing Dr. Daly, Lakeview Historical Society, Maverick Press, Bend, Oregon, 1986, pp. 62‚Äì63.Tonsfeldt, Ward, Historical Resource Survey of Lakeview, Oregon, study prepared for the Town of Lakeview Planning Office, Bend, Oregon, 1 August 1989, p. 16.Bach, Melva M., History of the Fremont National Forest, Fremont National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Lakeview, Oregon, 1981, p. 126. The Heryford Brothers Building was dedicated on 14 March 1913. Over 600 people attended the ceremony. After the dedication ceremony, Heryford hosted a community party that lasted from 7:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m the next morning. According to the Lake County Examiner, the event was \\"without a doubt the largest assemblage of beautifully gowned women ever gathered in Lakeview\\". The Examiner went on to speculate that Lakeview would never witness another such affair. The Heryford building was the largest structure in Lakeview when it was built in 1913, and it is still one of the city's most important commercial building today. Because the Heryford Brothers Building played an important role in the commercial development of Lakeview, the structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 30 April 1980.\\"Heryford Brothers Building\\", Oregon Historic Sites Database, State Historic Preservation Office, State of Oregon, Salem, Oregon, 6 June 2012.  Structure  The Heryford Brothers Building is a three-story Classical Revival style structure with of interior floor space. It was designed by San Francisco architect F. S. DeLongchamp, and constructed by I. A. (Andy) Underwood, a prominent Lakeview builder. When it was opened, the first floor was occupied by the Lakeview Mercantile Company, Lakeview's post office, and the Hall and Reynolds drug store. The United States Land Office and the local Elks Lodge occupied the second floor with professional offices on the third floor. The building included many features that were considered very modern, especially in an isolated eastern Oregon community in the early 20th century. These features included an electric power generator, central stream heat, elevators, telephones, electric lights, and hot water throughout the building. Heryford Building before sidewalk awning was removedThe building is a steel and masonry structure with a footprint measuring by . The main entrance faces Center Street. It is flanked by rusticated stone pillars and matching arch with a classical header above the double-door entry. There are rusticated stone pillars between the ground floor windows with brick pilasters above. There is also an inset entryway at the southwest corner of the building, facing the Center Street and F Street intersection. A heavy wooden awning suspended over the sidewalks along the first floor frontage was added sometime after the original construction. It was removed sometime after 2001, restoring the exterior to its original form. The second floor has square-framed triple window groups with upper transom windows above the main panes. The windows are all mounted in pine casement frames. On the third floor, the triple window groups are repeated, but within rounded arch frames. The building's sheet metal cornices have elaborate entablature, frieze, and dentil elements. The building also has a full basement.Tonsfeldt, Ward, Historical Resource Survey of Lakeview, Oregon, study prepared for the Town of Lakeview Planning Office, Bend, Oregon, 1 August 1989, pp. 42‚Äì4. Over the years, the first floor has been extensively remodeled to accommodate new commercial tenants. The mercantile store was replaced by a restaurant, and then new commercial space. Later, the Elks Lodge expanded to the first floor. The first floor modifications include dropped ceilings, new sheetrock walls, wood paneling, and new bathrooms. The first floor space occupied by the drug store has changed hands several times, but retains its original configuration. With the exception of fire code modifications the second and third floors generally retain their original configurations as well.  Location  The Heryford Brother Building occupies Lot A, Section 15, Township 39 South, Range 20 East of the Willamette Meridian in Lake County, Oregon. It is located on the north side of Center Street between E Street and F Street in Lakeview, Oregon. The building faces the Lake County Courthouse in the center of town.

History On the Red Carpet was originally launched in 2002 as an effort by KABC to brand their local coverage of the Academy Awards leading into the national coverage from ABC. They decided to continue the site and build the traffic. On March 14, 2010, the Sunday after the Academy Awards, On the Red Carpet was launched as a weekly series for KABC. Seven other ABC Owned Television Stations soon carried the show, with San Diego ABC affiliate KGTV San Diego also following. The show began to be carried by the national digital subchannel, the Live Well Network, also owned by AOTS, in the fall of 2010, with the addition of Chris Balish, as co-host. Balish left the show in 2012. The series produced their live Oscar special in 2012, which featured the college journalist winners of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences's Red Carpet Journalist Contest assisting in the interviews. The show moved from the Live Well Network to national syndication on September 14, 2013 with a return to a single host, mainly on ABC affiliates and usually airing on Saturday or Sunday afternoons against sports on other networks. On June 27, 2014, the OTRC.com website was shut down with the show using social media instead for content releases. The syndicated program ended production with their September 13, 2014 edition, but the On the Red Carpet banner will remain for KABC's Oscars coverage in the future. Format In its form, On The Red Carpet aired for half an hour every Sunday evening at 6:30 p.m. on KABC and is designed as a weekend slotted show with stations scheduling it in the access hour and late-fringe time-slots. The series was sold on an all-barter basis to stations with the ad split, 4 minutes local and three three-and-a-half minutes national per episode. It was hosted by Miss USA 2007 winner Rachel Smith and produced by KABC-TV‚Äôs news department. The episodes are shot on location instead of in studio. The show is composed of celebrity news, exclusive set visits, first looks at upcoming film and television projects, and one-on-one interviews with Hollywood talents and celebrities.

It has been described as promoting a conservative view of the United States Constitution. History BRI was founded in September 1999 by industrialist Charles Koch and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation. BRI's first president, Victoria Hughes, was a teacher who had also held a number of executive roles in other non-profit organizations. Hughes led the organization for a decade until her departure, after which Tony Woodlief filled her position as president. David Bobb, a former Hillsdale College professor and head of its Allan P. Kirby, Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship, became BRI's president in December 2013. Koch has explained that he became concerned with education in the field of constitutional law after he saw that many high school teachers had inadequate resources to develop educational materials on the principles, institutions, and ideas upon which the United States was founded. Organization operations =Professional development= BRI runs educational programs for teachers around the country. BRI conducted 64 constitutional seminars in the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, often held at historic sites such as George Washington‚Äôs Mount Vernon or James Madison‚Äôs Montpelier. Seminars include instruction from a university professor and training by a BRI master teacher. BRI professors include BRI board member and Professor of Law at George Mason University Todd Zywicki; author and professor of public policy at Pepperdine University Dr. Gordon Lloyd; University of Texas School of Law and Professor Dr. H.W. Perry, Jr. BRI says it has reached over 22,000 teachers through professional development seminars. =Online educational resources= In August 2014, Bill of Rights Institute launched Documents of Freedom, a free digital course on history, government, and economics. The course builds on excerpts from over 100 primary sources, including the Federalist and Anti- Federalist papers, presidential speeches, Supreme Court cases, and the Founding documents; and it offers an extensive set of original essays, focusing on principles such as federalism, separation of powers, limited government, checks and balances, republican government, consent of the governed, natural rights, rule of law, and due process, as well as virtues like self-governance, humility, integrity, justice, perseverance, respect, contribution, and responsibility. =Student programs= In 2006, BRI began a high school essay contest which asks students to reflect on civic values. Individuals who have taken part in the awards weekend include Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor and Clarence Thomas, journalist John Stossel, journalist and political analyst Juan Williams, Judge Andrew Napolitano, and NBA player Antawn Jamison. Other student programs run by BRI include the Constitutional Academy which provides students with a six-week study of the Constitution in Washington, D.C. In 2011 the Ford Motor Company Fund provided scholarships to 11 students to attend the Constitutional Academy.

Contini & Son (also known as A. J. Contini & Son) was a fine art plaster mold casting firm founded by Italian American Attilio Contini and his son Cesare. Based in New York, New York, United States, A. Contini & Son made plaster molds for sculptors around the world including James Earle Fraser, Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, Herbert Haseltine, A. Stirling Calder, Adolph Weinman, among others. It was the first casting facility of its kind in the United States. History Attilio Contini (1884-1960) founded A. Contini & Son. Contini's father was Augusto Contini, a caster who worked for the Vatican. Attilio Contini was credited with bringing Italian-style casting to the United States in the 1890s. The studio was located on East 12th Street in New York City. The firm worked with many notable public art sculptures including works by James Earle Fraser who worked closely with Attilio in the 1920s to create The End of the Trail.Douglas, 258. Cesare would later restore and create the molds for a re-installation of The End of the Trail at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. =Victor M. Contini= Victor Contini learned casting and molding as child, apprenticing under his father at the family's studio. Contini served in World War II and participated in the Invasion of Normandy. When he returned, he worked for his father, but had to get a job at Republic Aviation as a result in a decline in demand for monuments and cheaper casting options being available. He worked at the family firm when called by his brother Cesare Contini, who ran the company after the death of Atillio and until his own death in 1989. His most notable casting works were Georg J. Lober's Hans Christian Andersen and Paul Manship's Alice in Wonderland, both in Central Park. Other notable works of Victor Contini's include Rocket Thrower and The Lone Sailor. Victor Contini lived in Esopus, New York. He died September 10, 1995 at Vassar Brothers Medical Center of complications from a stroke. Gallery of works molded by A.

Unlike other remains assigned to the family Thylacosmilidae (a group of metatherian predators equipped with \\"saber teeth\\") that had been found previously, Anachlysictis is the first record of such borhyaenoids in northern South America, and also most primitive and ancient in the family (in fact, it is the first confirmed record that did not belong to the genus Thylacosmilus, until the official publication of Patagosmilus in 2010).Forasiepi A. & Carlini A.

Description  Anachlysictis, unlike its better-known relative Thylacosmilus, was smaller, weighing around ,Wroe, S., Argot, C., & Dickman, C. (2004).

Otherwise it can be assumed that their anatomy was generally not as specialized as that of his later relatives, but it had carnassial teeth to process more effectively meat and flat fangs, located just below the nose, without being cross-rounded as in other unspecialized mammal carnivores, while the accommodation area of the masseter muscle (involved in the movements of the jaw) was reduced.Goin, F.J. 2003. Early marsupial radiations in South America. En: M. Jones, C. Dickman y M. Archer (eds.), Predators with Pouches, The Biology of Carnivorous Marsupials, CSIRO Publishing, Australia, pp. 30-42. This is because, as in other related predatory saber-toothed species, such as Thylacosmilus and the cat Smilodon, this muscle is reduced, leaving more space for the jaw joint to increase its opening angle, which although affecting mandibular power is compensated because they do not need such a large bite force to use their canines because they let the well-developed neck muscles bring down the skull and allow the fangs to cross through the flesh of their prey.  Taxonomy  Notably, until its discovery it was supposed that Thylacosmilus was a close relative of the family Borhyaenidae, or even a specialized member of the same, having emerged in the Late Miocene; the most primitive characteristics and age of Anachlysictis suggest a previous origins of the thylacosmilids at the base of the superfamily Borhyaenoidea, whose monophyly needs review. In fact, the pattern of the molars of Anachlysictis is very similar to the little-known methatherian Hondadelphys, also from the Honda Group at the Konzentrat- Lagerst√§tte La Venta that was considered early as a rare species of opossum and now considered a primitive member of the Sparassodonta, so Hondadelphys could well represent the sister clade of Thylacosmilidae.

He was a mulatto but was very light-skinned. He was educated at the secondary school (lyc√©e) in Saint-Pierre, then in Paris at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand. After rejecting a career as a teacher, he enrolled at the Sorbonne and then at the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris. L√©mery became a lawyer in 1898 and joined the bar of Paris in 1899. In May 1902 his whole family died during the eruption of Mount Pel√©e. He twice married French women. In 1902 L√©mery entered the office of Ernest Vall√©, the Minister of Justice, as deputy to Henry de Jouvenel. He joined the French Section of the Workers' International in 1906 and ran unsuccessfully for Deputy of Martinique that year. He again failed to be elected in 1909 for the 12th arondissement of Paris. In January 1914 he was elected deputy for Martinique. =World War I= During World War I (1914‚Äì18) L√©mery was exempt from military service as a colonial, but enlisted as a private soldier. He served in Champagne, Verdun and the Somme, was promoted to officer and was awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honour and the Croix de Guerre. He returned to the Chamber of Deputies in 1917, where he was vocal on subjects related to the war. He was offered but refused the portfolio of Minister of War for the Army by Paul Painlev√©, whom he had criticized harshly. On 16 November 1917 he accepted the position of Minister of State for Maritime Transport and the Merchant Marine in the second cabinet of Georges Clemenceau. He resigned on 28 November 1918 on the basis that his job was done. =Inter-war period= On 18 January 1920 L√©mery was elected Senator of Martinique in place of Am√©d√©e Knight, who had died. He was defeated in the election of 6 January 1924, but returned to the senate after his opponent's election was invalidated. L√©mery spoke in favor of making the colonies of Martinique and Guadeloupe departments of France, saying they had been part of the French Empire for so long that they were more French than France itself. The senate voted for the change, then backed off and dropped it. He was reelected on 10 January 1933. He was a member of the Democratic, Radical and Radical Socialist Left. He was involved in a broad range of issues, and sat on many committees. He was briefly Minister of Justice in the second cabinet of Gaston Doumergue, from 15 October 1934 until the government fell on 8 November 1934. L√©mery became a tireless critic of foreign policy, where he felt that France was weak and inconsistent, and supported Western European unity and the League of Nations. He approved the policy of non- intervention during the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39). He interviewed General Francisco Franco in April 1938, who told him, \\"Nationalist Spain has made no appeal to any power. It was only when the Russian tanks made their appearance in Madrid [...] that the Generalissimo of the Nationalist forces decided to allow foreign volunteers to enlist.\\" L√©mery became a moderate conservative and a close friend of Marshal Philippe P√©tain. L√©mery approved the Munich Agreement. =World War II= World War II (1939‚Äì45) began in September 1939, but there was a considerable delay before Germany attacked France, a period called the Guerre d'attente (The Waiting War - known as the Phoney War in English). In his memoirs L√©mery wrote that a month after the war had begun he visited Marshal P√©tain in Spain and tried to persuade him to form a new government. P√©tain said he was willing to take charge of the armed forces but was not qualified to lead a government, and would not know who to appoint to his cabinet. L√©mery said he could find reliable men such as Pierre Laval, Rapha√´l Alibert and Adrien Marquet. Although P√©tain continued to object, L√©mery thought that in the end he would agree, and after returning to Paris continued to work towards arranging a potential cabinet for a P√©tain government. A list of ministers was ready by 9 October 1939. On 16 November 1939 L√©mery wrote in Paris-Soir that Germany would be slowly strangled if she waited, but would be overwhelmingly defeated if she attacked. On 10 May 1940 Germany launched an invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, and ten days later reached the English Channel at Abbeville. The German army broke through the Somme/Aisne line on 5‚Äì7 June 1940. Prime Minister Paul Reynaud resigned on 16 June 1940 and P√©tain was asked to form a new government. The armistice between France and Germany was signed on 22 June 1940. On 10 July 1940 in Vichy L√©mery voted for granting P√©tain the increased powers that he was seeking. L√©mery was appointed Colonial Secretary in P√©tain's government on 12 July 1940. He did what he could to prevent the Gaullists from taking over the French colonial empire, and transmitted P√©tainist messages that called for respect for authority and for the people to leave the cities and \\"return to the soil\\". On 15 July 1940 he sent a call for unity to all \\"loyal\\" colonial governors. On 16 August 1940 he wrote to the governor of Senegal, \\"I ask you to ensure that in Dakar a strong discipline and rigorous order be maintained, as well as a respect of leaders. You are to prevent the all too frequent and unnecessary desertion of the village, undertaken out of a desire to escape obligations. The net effect has been the swelling of urban centers.\\" His influence in the French West Indies is indicated by a comment by the American vice consul there, who said in August, L√©mery extended the laws of 18‚Äì19 August 1940 to the colonies, prohibiting \\"extraordinary sessions\\" of elected councils and banning secret societies (eg. freemasons, of whom the Vichy regime disapproved). He was dismissed on 6 September 1940 during a cabinet reshuffle, and was succeeded by Rear-Admiral Charles Platon. L√©mery later claimed, presumably correctly, that he had been dismissed due to German pressure because of his \\"colonial origins\\". That is, for racist reasons. His mandate as Senator expired on 31 December 1941. L√©mery sent a letter to Pierre Laval on 28 August 1942 in which he proposed to introduce the Conseil Local to the Antilles, and to make Guadeloupe and Martinique French d√©partements. By doing so the islanders would be assured that the government intended to preserve their status as anciennes colonies. =Last years= After the war L√©mery was sentenced to five years of \\"national indignity\\" for his support of the Vichy regime. He was tried by the High Court and was acquitted in 1947. In 1964 he published D'Une R√©publique 'a l'Autre: Souvenirs de la M√™l√©e Politique 1894-1944 in which he defended his political career. A reviewer wrote, \\"To those who are still interested in the war-time political divisions, this personal account may have some nostalgic appeal, for it does evoke certain authentic attitudes of the Third Republic.\\" In 1965 he was accused of insulting the Head of State (General de Gaulle, who had returned to power in 1958) in this book, and defended himself in court at the age of 90. Henry L√©mery died in the 7th arrondissement of Paris on 26 April 1972 at the age of 97.

The film is directed by Takehiko Shinjo, and it stars actors Keiko Kitagawa, Osamu Mukai, Yusuke Yamamoto.  Plot  The movie setting and date takes place in Tokyo, year 2010. Yukari Hayasaka (Keiko Kitagawa) is a high school student who has become tired of her life of constant schooling. The only thing that hasn't become boring is her crush for Hiroyuki Tokumori (Yusuke Yamamoto) - a classmate. One day, on her way home after school, Arashi Nagase (Kento Kaku) spots her and upon his confrontation she runs away thinking he is a gangster because of his dress style. Whilst running, Yukari trips and falls into the arms of Isabelle (Shunji Igarashi), a friend of Aarashi who's dressed as a woman, that carries her back to their studio \\"Paradise Kiss\\" after she faints. When Yukari gains consciousness, she meets Arashi's girlfriend Miwako Sakurada (Aya Omasa) who gives her the nickname 'Caroline', and is formally introduced to everyone known as the ParaKiss group. The trio then explain that they are a group of student fashion designers in need of a model for their clothing label (Paradise Kiss) and for a fashion show competition being held at their institution. Yukari refuses to be their model because she feels that it is a \\"waste of time\\" and that fashion designers are \\"slackers\\" and decides to leave but not before she meets Jouji 'George' Koizumi (Osamu Mukai) standing at door. The next day, George meets Yukari at her school and takes her for a haircut by a friend at his institution as well as a trip to a fabric store with the ParaKiss members all in the hope that she might change her mind. Yukari knows nothing about the fashion world and is taken back by the group's eccentric ways but eventually agrees to become their model after George takes her to a 'love hotel' and confronts her for acting prideful, when she places the blame on others for her miseries and does not know what she wants out of life. Yukari soon comes to admire the groups free thinking ways and ability to pursue their dreams with a one track mind which inspires her to become independent and create her own path in life. At the same time, Yukari finds out that Hiroyuki, Arashi and Miwako were childhood friends but when Hiroyuki moved away, Arashi and Miwako grew closer and became a couple thus resulting in Hiroyuki not being able to make contact with them anymore when he moved back due to a bet he and Arashi had made as children. Yukari's strict mother, Yasuko (Michiko Hada) confronts Yukari about her studies upon which Yukari mentions the modeling project and that she does not want to study much for her next mock exam. Yasuko slaps Yukari which results in her moving out of her house and moving in with George. Yukari decides to drop out of school and find a job which to her surprise, requires applicants to have completed school. George arranges a 'one-day' modelling job for Yukari via his hairdresser friend which she successfully completes due to George's positive encouragement. George then shows Yukari his \\"special closet collection\\" which contains all of the dresses he's ever made but no one has worn them because he wants someone \\"special\\" to wear them. Eventually, Yukari begins to develop feelings for George. When George's rival, Kaori Asou (Natsuki Kato) decides to visit, Yukari is instantly jealous and confronts Kaori about her feelings for George. Kaori denies having any feelings for him and mentions that she is more of a \\"career woman\\" whose only love and goal is fashion as well as the upcoming competition. George changes the groups' design at the last minute and the ParaKiss group is left to complete the dress on the day of the competition. At the same time, this is their last project as a group because their designer clothes that were placed in stores, were all returned due to no sales and the group made a decision beforehand that if the clothes were not sold, they would go their separate ways meaning that George will fulfill his dream of going to Paris once they graduate. Yukari also calls home and tells her younger brother to give their mother Yasuko message about the fashion show. During the runway practice, Yukari struggles to walk due to her nerves which results in her regretting that she did not take the show seriously and George reprimanding her for being her usual, uncaring, not-so-serious self. Isabelle cheers up Yukari and tells her his life story that when he was a child, he never felt right as a boy and George made him his first dress which made him never wear men's clothing again. Isabelle goes on to explain that clothes are \\"magical\\" and give people courage which is why they've continued to make them for so long and maybe Yukari will find courage in the dress they've made for her. Yasuko and Hiroyuki attend the fashion show eagerly awaiting Yukari's turn. Before her walk, George gives Yukari a butterfly ring (which is also a symbol on the Paradise Kiss logo) and tells her that she should create her own walk and be like a \\"butterfly\\". Yukari completes the runway walk with elegance and poise and in turn receives a standing ovation. George is mesmerized by Yukari's walk and they share a kiss. Despite Yukari's mesmerizing walk, Kaori wins the fashion competition and the Paradise Kiss group is officially disbanded. Yukari meets Yasuko after the show and is asked to go back home. Yukari packs and leaves Georges apartment without saying goodbye but coincidentally meets George outside. She tells him that she is meeting Hiroyuki and he takes her to buy clothes, make up and does her hair for their meet. Upset by how George is acting, Yukari runs away with George following her and confronts him outside about his confusing actions referring to his kiss after the show and him getting her ready for a date with someone else. Yukari tells George that she knows what she wants out of life and has decided to pursue a modelling career. George wishes Yukari all the best and they part ways. Meanwhile, Hiroyuki is waiting with Miwako and is planning to confess his feelings to Yukari. George goes back to his place to find Isabelle waiting with his bags packed. Isabelle decides to follow George to Paris and work together with him. The two eventually leave for Paris and Yukari is left somewhat heartbroken and upset by the recent events. Yukari receives a package with a butterfly logo (from George) containing a key and an address. She rushes off to the place and finds an abandoned building with an upstairs room. Yukari enters the room using the key to find all of Georges clothes from his \\"special closet collection\\" and recalls him saying that he wants someone \\"special\\" to have them. Yukari cries realising Georges feelings for her and treasures the wonderful gifts he gave her. A few years later, posters of Yukari are all over Tokyo and Hiroyuki is shown crossing the street with a girl. He mentions how Yukari rejected him when he confessed his feelings on the day they met years before. Yukari, now a successful model worldwide, mentions how she did her best to become a model and how she keeps a copy of all her magazine covers on a table in the old ParaKiss studio, in hope that she can one day show them to the ParaKiss members, especially George. One day, Yukari travels to New York for work and discovers a poster of a model wearing a dress with a \\"butterfly\\" print on it outside a theater. She finds George's name on the poster and spots Isabelle going through the back entrance of the theater. Yukari pursues Isabelle and finds out that George and he were in Paris for a while but decided to shift to New York. He gives Yukari George's studio / apartment address and she goes over to find that he's not there but decides to look around. A wind blows through the opened window making George's designs spread all over the place. As Yukari tries to tidy them up, she discovers a large pile of magazines that have her photo on them. She realises that George had been keeping track of her career and had purchased all her magazines from Japan and around the world, throughout the years despite being abroad. George arrives and is surprised to see Yukari. They share an eye lock moment then run and hug each other. The movie ends on a happy note with George and Yukari sharing a kiss.

He has written for media outlets including The Sun, The Mirror, The Guardian, Mojo, Wax Poetics and the Huffington Post. From 2011 to 2019, he worked at Yellow Advertiser. In 2018, he won the first Ray Fitzwalter Award for early career journalists in the UK outside of London, for his investigation into the cover up of a historic paedophile ring. \\\\- \\\\- Work =Shoebury sex ring investigation= Thomson spent years investigating the cover-up of a historic paedophile ring in Shoebury, Essex, eventually finding evidence that the leader of the ring had been a police informant. The investigation began when he discovered a series of compensation payments authorised by Essex County Council for \\"alleged abuse\\" linked to its children's departments between the 1970s and the 1990s. His campaign for transparency over the payments led to a whistleblower coming forward with concerns about how authorities had handled an investigation into a 1980s paedophile ring in Shoebury. When other whistleblowers came forward with corroborating stories, Thomson arranged for them to meet the then Essex Police and Crime Commissioner, Nick Alston, who in turn introduced them to the Chief Constable of Essex Police and a senior detective. These meetings resulted in police reopening the case and a man being arrested. Further work by Thomson later caused police to reopen the case a second time. Thomson discovered a link between the Shoebury ring and the sex offender Lennie Smith, a member of the \\"Dirty Dozen\\" paedophile gang, which was responsible for the deaths of Jason Swift, Barry Lewis and Mark Tildseley in the 1980s. Thomson also discovered old files that documented the cover-up of the Shoebury case in real-time. The documents included a confession by a police officer that the leader of the paedophile ring had been a \\"registered informant\\", despite decades of sexual offending against children. In 2019, Thomson appeared as a guest speaker at the Nations and Regions Media Conference in Media City to deliver a talk about the investigation. =Court reporting= Thomson has covered numerous court cases, including high profile murder trials. They include the trial of Jordan Taylor, who stabbed his girlfriend Laura Davies to death in a jealous rage, and the trial of Joram Bakumanya, who stabbed a man to death during a tantrum because a young woman had refused to give him her phone number. \\\\- http://www.charles-thomson.net/Portfolio-Court-Jordan-Taylor.html / http://www.charles-thomson.net/Portfolio-Court-Joram-Bakumanya.html Thomson also covered the case of Internet predator Lewis Daynes, who sexually assaulted and then murdered 14-year-old schoolboy Breck Bednar. In 2019, Thomson contributed to a Channel 4 documentary about the Daynes case called \\"Shocking Emergency Calls\\". \\\\- Thomson also reported on Lord Hanningfield's successful lawsuit against Essex Police, for unlawfully arresting him over allegations that he had wrongly claimed expenses from Essex County Council. \\\\- =Feature writing= Thomson first won praise for his feature-writing shortly after graduating from university, when he was handed a \\"Special Commendation\\" in the Feature Writer of the Year category at the Guardian Student Media Awards, 2009. The award was created in 2009 especially to acknowledge the strength of Thomson's article, \\"James Brown: The Lost Album\\", which pieced together the final recording sessions of the so-called \\"Godfather of Soul\\". One competition judge later commented, \\"I thought it was the best piece of student journalism I'd read in a long time, if not ever.\\"In pictures: Guardian Student Media Awards 2009 winners, The Guardian, 26 November 2009Young journalist praised for 'extraordinary piece of work', Basildon Recorder, 19 December 2009 Shortly after winning the award, Thomson became one of the youngest journalists ever to be given their own blog at the US Huffington Post, where he wrote features about subjects including Michael Jackson, Hunter S Thompson and the execution of Troy Davis.Charles Thomson, Huffington Post \\\\- \\"Strange Fruit Still Falling in the Southern States\\", Huffington Post, 27 September 2011] \\\\- \\"Animals, Whores & Dialogue: The Resurrection of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson\\", Huffington Post, 26 July 2010] Thomson's Huffington Post article, \\"One of the Most Shameful Episodes in Journalistic History\\", was published on the fifth anniversary of the verdict in the 2005 trial of Michael Jackson. Comparing trial transcripts to media reporting he argued that journalists had deliberately skewed their reporting in favour of the prosecution. It is frequently mentioned in Michael Jackson biographies. In addition to investigative features, Thomson specialises in in-depth interviews. His subjects include Jermaine Jackson, the jailed peer Lord Hanningfield, the Motown star Martha Reeves, the gay rapper Cazwell, the death row lawyer Clive Stafford-Smith and the funk legend Bootsy Collins. Thomson's series of interviews with Lord Hanningfield formed part of a portfolio of work which won him a \\"Highly Commended\\" award in the Newcomer of the Year category at the EDF Energy Regional Media Awards in 2012. Thomson has used a first-person, \\"gonzo journalism\\" approach to recount unusual interviews, such as when his attempted interview with the former TV presenter Michael Barrymore went awry. Thomson was told Barrymore had agreed to be interviewed but the star refused to co- operate on Thomson's arrival. He instead invited Thomson to sit in on a radio recording as an observer, but then turned the tables and started grilling him on-air. Thomson recounted the story in a first-person article that formed part of a portfolio that won him a \\"Highly Commended\\" award in the Newcomer of the Year category at the EDF Energy Regional Media Awards in 2012. He also used a \\"gonzo\\" approach to describe an \\"unconventional\\" interview with the artist Ralph Steadman, and to recount \\"crazy\\" backstage antics at Britain's V Festival. \\\\- =James Brown= In 2008, Thomson interviewed Brown's former co-writer Fred Wesley for Wax Poetics magazine. During the interview, Wesley spoke about working on Brown's final album in 2005. The interview inspired Thomson to research the album, spending several months interviewing more than a dozen people who were directly involved in the its production. The resulting article, \\"James Brown: The Lost Album\\", won a special commendation award in the feature writing category at the Guardian Student Media Awards in November 2009. In October 2010, Tomi Rae Brown, the widow of James Brown, gave Thomson the most in-depth interview she had ever given. In the article published by Sawf News, Brown spoke about her husband's 2004 arrest for domestic assault and how she nursed him through cancer in 2005. She also claimed that Brown's legs had been sawn off after his death to obtain DNA to prove her son's paternity. Thomson has also written about Brown for Mojo magazine and spoken about the singer on the Los Angeles radio station KPFA-FM. In February 2013, Thomson published an in-depth feature, titled \\"The Big Payback\\", about Brown's humanitarian work and his family's efforts to carry it on after his death. Brown's friend and producer, the gospel singer Derrick Monk, said the piece brought years to his eyes. In an article published in the Huffington Post, Thomson was critical of the James Brown biopic Get on Up, which he said contained significant inaccuracies that were detrimental to Brown's legacy. He also interviewed a selection of Brown's former musicians for the Huffington Post, before the HBO documentary Mr. Dynamite, by Alex Gibney. \\\\- =Michael Jackson= Throughout 2009, he contributed regularly to The Sun newspaper in the UK as a Michael Jackson expert. His work for The Sun began in March 2009 when he received insider information on Jackson's imminent arrival in the UK to announce his \\"This Is It\\" concerts and helped the paper to obtain exclusive pictures of Jackson disembarking from his private jet. Thomson was contacted by a British tabloid to supply information about the 1993 sexual abuse allegations against Jackson, only to have the tabloid replace his carefully researched information with common myths he had advised them to avoid. He noted that when Jackson's FBI file was released, the contents were portrayed media wide as giving an impression of guilt even though the file strongly supported his innocence. He noted how Gene Simmons' 2010 allegations about Jackson molesting children received over a hundred times more coverage than the interview with Jackson's guitarist, Jennifer Batten, rebutting Simmons' claims. Thomson has interviewed several of Jackson's former collaborators including the tour guitarist Jennifer Batten, \\"This Is It\\" dancer Kriyss Grant, his former manager Dieter Wiesner and the publicist Stuart Backerman for Sawf News. \\\\- \\\\- On the fifth anniversary of Jackson's acquittal, Thomson's Huffington Post article \\"One of the Most Shameful Episodes In Journalistic History\\" was published, uncovering the media's inaccurate reporting during the trial by comparing trial transcripts to the news reports about the proceedings at the time. The piece was later incorporated into an anti-bullying curriculum on words and violence by the Voices Education Project. The article was praised by Jackson's former defence attorney Thomas Mesereau and has been cited in Michael Jackson biographies. \\\\- In 2011, Thomson interviewed Jackson's brother Jermaine Jackson. During the interview, Jermaine said of Thomson, \\"He knows more than I do!\\" Two years later, before Jacksons' first performance in London for 40 years, Jermaine granted Thomson his only solo promotional interview. Thomson has been critical of the Michael Jackson Estate, writing in Huffington Post articles that releasing posthumous albums is a direct contradiction of Jackson's beliefs and wishes, as stated in several interviews and writings during his lifetime. \\\\- Thomson's work on Jackson's 2005 trial was cited heavily in Randall Sullivan's 2012 Jackson biography Untouchable. His work was also cited in other Jackson biographies including Joseph Vogel's Man in the Music, Mike Smallcombe's Making Michael and J. Randy Taraborrelli's The Magic and the Madness. \\\\- In 2016, Thomson created an audio documentary investigating the origin of false claims that Jackson was booed off the stage at the 2006 World Music Awards. He interviewed Jackson's personal manager and photographer, as well as witnesses from the event, and scrutinised audio and video evidence. Interviews with Thomson have been included in a series of documentaries about Jackson, including Square One: Michael Jackson, Neverland Firsthand: Investigating the Michael Jackson Documentary, Leaving Neverland: The Aftermath and Lies of Leaving Neverland.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXOfz1YkWeA In 2019, Thomson was invited to speak at UCLA's \\"Truth Be Told\\" event ‚Äì a seminar about honesty in documentary filmmaking ‚Äì regarding the TV show Leaving Neverland. Other speakers included the Oscar nominee Taylor Hackford, the court reporter Linda Deutsch and the executor of Jackson‚Äôs estate, John Branca. \\\\- \\\\- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6KWrdm1uIY Awards In 2009, Thomson won the Special Commendation Award in the feature writing category at the Guardian Student Media Awards, for his article \\"James Brown: The Lost Album\\". The award was presented by The Guardian writer Hannah Pool and the radio presenter Colin Murray at the ceremony at Proud Galleries in Camden Town, London. The Special Commendation Award was created in 2009 especially to acknowledge the strength of Thomson's article, and one competition judge later commented, \\"I thought it was the best piece of student journalism I'd read in a long time, if not ever.\\"The panel of judges added, \\"The feature was an extraordinary, sustained piece on James Brown, a poignant portrait of a man in his last days.\\" In 2015, he was named Weekly Print Journalist of the Year at the East of England Media Awards, organized by HoldTheFrontPage. In 2016, Thomson won the \\"Highly Commended\\" award in the Local Heroes category at the British Journalism Awards, described as \\"the UK's equivalent to the Pulitzer Prize\\". In 2018, Thomson was shortlisted in the category for the second time. \\\\- \\\\- In 2017, he was named Highly Commended Weekly Reporter of the Year at the Society of Editors Regional Press Awards. In 2018, he won the commendation for the second consecutive year. In 2018, Thomson won the inaugural Ray Fitzwalter Award for Investigative Journalism. The award, created in honour of the World in Action journalist Ray Fitzwalter, was sponsored by ITV and Channel 4. Thomson won for his Shoebury sex ring investigation. It was presented by the Channel 4 commissioner Dorothy Byrne and the ITV journalist Lucy Meacock. The other shortlisted investigations were both BBC projects, one of which was the Panama Papers investigation. The judges praised Thomson's \\"resourcefulness and determination\\". His work was described as \\"brilliant\\" and as demonstrating \\"that resourcefulness, determination and the nose for a story are far more important than big budgets\\". His campaign led the police to reopen their investigation into this case. In 2019, Thomson won two awards at the Society of Editors Regional Press Awards. He was named Weekly Reporter of the Year for work including his Shoebury sex ring investigation. The investigation also won a public vote for the Making A Difference People's Choice Award. The Society of Editors praised Thomson's \\"tenacity, intelligence, and courage\\". \\\\- A month later, he was awarded a commendation in the MHP 30 to Watch awards, which identifies Britain's \\"most talented and influential journalists\\" aged 30 and under. He was shortlisted for the Paul Foot Award 2020 for his Yellow Advertiser investigation into a paedophile police informant. On 19 June 2020, Thomson was announced, for the third year in 4 years, as \\"highly commended\\" in the weekly reporter section when the winners of Regional Press Awards for 2019 were announced.Mariella Brown, \\"Winners of Regional Press Awards for 2019 announced\\", Society of Editors press release, 19 June 2020.

Few hypothetical carbon allotropes denser than diamond are known. All these allotropes can be divided at two groups: the first are hypothetically stable at ambient conditions; the second are high-pressure carbon allotropes which become quasi-stable only at high pressure. According to the SACADA database, the first group comprises the structures, called hP3, tI12, st12, r8, I41/a, P41212, m32, m32*, t32, t32*, H-carbon and uni. Among them st12 carbon was proposed as far as 1987 in the work of R. Biswas et al. MP8, OP8, SC4, BC-8 and (9,0) carbon allotropes belong to the second group - they are hypothetically quasi-stable at the high pressure. BC-8 carbon is not only a superdense allotrope but also one of the oldest hypothetical carbon structures - initially it was proposed in 1984 in the work R. Biswas et al. The MP8 structure proposed in the work J. Sun et al., is almost two times denser than diamond - its density is as high as 7.06 g/cm3 and it is the highest value reported so far. Band gaps All hypothetical superdense carbon allotropes have dissimilar band gaps compared to the others. For example, SC4 is supposed to be a metallic allotrope while st12, m32, m32*, t32, t32* have band gaps larger that 5.0 eV. Carbon tetrahedra These new materials would have structures based on carbon tetrahedra, and represent the densest of such structures. On the opposite end of the density spectrum is a recently theorized tetrahedral structure called T-carbon. This is obtained by replacing carbon atoms in diamond with carbon tetrahedra. In contrast to superdense allotropes, T-carbon would have very low density and hardness.

Design and development Bruno Nagler began wind tunnel experiments into helicopter design in 1926 and developed the first practical swash plate. The Nagler NH-120 was developed to test the idea of counteracting rotor torque with a small separate rotor. The engine was mounted above the main rotor on a shaft, and the anti-torque rotor was mounted above both. The NH-160 had a conventional helicopter engine and rotor layout, with the exception of the smaller anti-torque rotor mounted under the fuselage between the landing skids. Yaw control on both was effected through changing the difference in rotational speed between the two rotors, using a series of disc brakes. A small tail surface provided directional stability in forward flight. The smaller rotor would spin at a higher rpm, with about 60 percent of the load,. the main rotor being adjustable for lift control. The NH-160 proved to be much more stable in tests than the NH-120 which had a higher center of gravity.

A fl√®che fa√Æti√®re is a carved rooftop spear or spire or finial that adorns Kanak houses, particularly the Great Houses of the Kanak Chiefs, in New Caledonia. The ceremonial carving is the home of ancestral spirits and is characterized by three major components. The ancestor is symbolized by a flat, crowned face in the centre of the spear. The ancestor's voice is symbolized by a long, rounded pole that is run through by conch shells. The symbolic connection of the clan, through the chief, is a base, which is planted into the case's central pole. Sharply pointed wood pieces fan out from either end of the central area, symbolically preventing bad spirits from being able to reach the ancestor. It evokes, beyond a particular ancestor, the community of ancestors. The fl√®che fa√Æti√®re was depicted on a 2007 New Caledonian stamp. Etymology Fl√®che is a general architectural term for \\"spire\\". It is used to define a small but tall post that is fixed at the crossing of the nave and transepts in cathedrals and large churches. Fl√®che fa√Æti√®re means \\"carved roof top spear\\", which adorns the grande case or the \\"Great Hut\\" of the Chief of a Kanak clan. Symbolism The ' is wood sculpture that represents the spirit of Kanak culture, which resembles a small totem pole. As it represented the power of the clan Chiefs of Kanaks over their subjects, it was adopted as part of the flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The Grand Huts also known as ' (chef's hut) are decorated with a ' as a filial, representing the ancestral spirits, symbolic of transition between the world of the dead and the world of the living. The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at the end to insert threaded shells from bottom to top; one of the shells contains arrangements to ensure protection of the house and the country. During wars enemies attacked this symbolic finial. After the death of a Kanak chief, over whose Great House the ' is fixed, it is removed and his family takes it to their home. Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect, it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at the mounds of abandoned grand houses. Flag Kanak community, showing a fl√®che fa√Æti√®re (a spear‚Äìlike wooden totem monument placed atop traditional dwellings). The fl√®che fa√Æti√®re also adorns the official flag of the Kanak people. As it represented the power of the Chiefs over their subjects, it was adopted as part of the flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The flag of Kanaky is set in three colours namely, green for earth and flora, red for blood and sacrifice of people and blue signifying sea and sky. The solar disk with the hut inscribed, with the ridge pole in black, which is the symbolic fl√®che fa√Æti√®re, is set in the middle of the flag. The flag representing the indigenous movement of the Kanak people was endorsed by the territorial congress to be flown alongside the national flag of France, and the Prime Minister of France was set to hoist the Kanak flag during his visit to New Caledonia in July 2010. The indigenous Kanak flag and the French tricolour were hoisted above the high commission in Noum√©a, the capital of New Caledonia. It is one of the few countries to have two national flags. However, there is a strong move now to evolve a new flag for New Caledonia, which would represent elements of the \\"Tricolor and the Kanak flags as a common destiny\\". Notable examples The Mwa Ka is located in a landscaped square opposite the Mus√©e de Nouvelle-Cal√©donie and has a 12-metre pole, topped with fl√®che fa√Æti√®re; its carvings represent the eight customary regions of New Caledonia.

It was assigned to the Pacific in World War II where it transported supplies, personnel and munitions around the islands in the Southern Solomon Islands. It was under constant threat of air, sea and submarine attack. Class notes On 19 January 1942, the Chief of Naval Operations directed the construction of 50 AMc coastal minesweepers, AMc 150‚Äì199. In February 1942, the Bureau of Ships issued specifications for modified design for the AMc 150‚Äì199. On 13 April 1942, the Chief of Naval Operations requested that the 50 vessels be constructed as \\"raider transports, AP,\\" for use in the South Pacific. On 20 April 1942, the District Craft Development Board recommended the following three uses for the redesigned APc transport vessels: #. Transportation of two officers and 74 men (possibly a raiding party) for maximum for each of 24 hours. #. Transportation of two officers, 15 men, and a cargo of 1,500 cu. ft. for 24 hours. #. Carrying a cargo of 4,000 cu. ft. (17 tons) and no passengers on a voyage of 2,500 miles. AMc-161 was thus redesigned as APc-25. Assignment in World War II APc-25 was assigned to the Pacific in World War II where it transported supplies, personnel and munitions around the islands in the Southern Solomon Islands. The Navy Special Collections & Archives contains two declassified Ship Action Reports regarding APc-25 during August 1943. The first report, dated 15 August 1943 (11 pages in length), pertains to rescue work by APc-25 following the sinking of , on 13 August 1943. The second report, dated 18 August 1943 (11 pages in length), deals largely with enemy aircraft attacks sustained by APc-25. The Ship Action Reports were written by Commanding Officer Lieutenant John D. Cartano, and include sworn statements by other officers. =Rescue of the survivors of John Penn= According to the first Ship Action Report dated 15 August 1943, APc-25 was stationed half a mile off Lunga Point, Guadalcanal. It received orders to take medical supplies and mail to American forces stationed at Enogai on the western side of New Georgia Island, and to evacuate casualties and convoy LCT 325 and LCT 327 to the same place with supplies and equipment. On 13 August 1943, APc-25 received a condition red, and enemy action ensued. A Japanese torpedo bomber made a hit on John Penn and was hit in so doing. It crashed into the water a few hundred feet from John Penn. APc-25 immediately gave the ship emergency full speed ahead. APc-25 left its convoy, and was beside John Penn in approximately three minutes. APc-25 was the first ship of any kind to arrive. Fire had broken out at the stern of John Penn, and oil from that ship on the water had caught fire. APc-25 stopped just short of the burning oil near the stern of John Penn where a large number of her crew were swimming, floating or struggling in the water. Many were injured and were having difficulty staying afloat. Without waiting for life rafts to be launched, at least four of the men from APc-25 dived over the side to rescue whomever they could. The first to go over the side was Lieutenant E. L. Burdick, third officer and engineering officer of APc-25. He was followed by William Lavern Hull, Thomas Francis Blake, Willard Daniel Persson, and possibly other men. Each was able to take in tow at least one of the injured men. All suitable gear was immediately put over the side of APc-25, including a rubber life raft, two ten-men life rafts, and a wherry. The crew of APc-25 manned the rafts and boat. They were quickly filled with men taken in tow. The crew of APc-25 was able to pick up numerous others by paddling around. Cargo nets were put over the side of APc-25, which were used by survivors able to swing to the side of the ship and climb up. Stretchers were lowered to raise those were too severely injured to climb aboard and those who could not otherwise be raised. The Commanding Officer of arrived on the scene at about the time that John Penn sank, although they picked up no casualties. Higgins boats (LCVP) and ducks were dispatched from shore and assisted materially in the rescue operations. The most severely injured survivors were put aboard the Higgins boats and sent ashore for immediate treatment after crew members of APc-25 administered what first aid it could. The crew members included a doctor and two extra pharmacists mates, J. D. Johnson and H. G. Hubbert. Those who were able to make the grade were sent ashore in the Higgins boats to receive hospitalization. Some were kept aboard in crew's bunks until receiving first aid treatment, and until Dr. Johnson was certain that they could safely be sent ashore. Parts of six Higgins boats were filled with these casualties. The number of survivors picked up and sent ashore was conservatively numbered at 35. There may have been more. While first aid was being administered aboard, the life rafts and boats were searching for additional injured men. Some were picked up in a semi-conscious condition, talking incoherently, and badly injured and bleeding. Many were shock victims resulting from the explosion. Others had leg injuries, concussions, and deep gashes on the head and face. A few were severely burned. None died or drowned to the knowledge of the crew of APc-25. After the crew was satisfied that there were no more men who could be rescued and no more survivors in the water, and after APc-25 had sent ashore its last case, APc-25 returned to its convoy which had been ordered by APc-25 to stand by. APc-25 then proceeded to carry out its orders and mission, departing Laguna Point on 13 August 1943, at 10:49 p.m. During the rescue operation, APc-25 had pressure in its fire mains. However, there was no possibility of saving John Penn. The fire spread quickly, and in approximately eight minutes, according to Commanding Officer Lieutenant John D. Cartano, John Penn began settling by the stern. In approximately a half an hour, at 9:55 p.m., the ship sank. =Other South Solomon Islands naval action= A second Special Action Report dated 18 August 1943 detailed enemy action and engagement on the trip from Lunga Point to New Georgia Island. APc-25 left Lunga Point, Guadalcanal Island, in a convoy with LCT 325 and LCT 327. These two ships were loaded with supplies and rations for American forces stationed at Enogai, New Georgia Island. The trip was approximately 235 miles. The ships proceeded via Russell Islands, Segi Point, Mongo Entrance, and Visu Visu Point. The convoy arrived at Enogai on 16 August 1943. On 15 August 1943, aircraft were heard off the port bow of APc-25, approximately two miles beyond Lever Harbor. There was almost constant enemy air activity from that time until approximately early morning on 16 August 1943. On 15 August 1943, a flare was dropped over Vila, Solomon Islands on Kolombangara. A second flare was dropped over Rice Anchorage. Two additional flares were dropped about two points off the starboard bow of APc-25, at about 1,500 yards distance. At approximately the time of the last two flares, a bomb, not over 500 pounds, was dropped off the port bow at a distance of approximately 300 yards. The concussion was felt. No shrapnel hit APc-25 or the crew. APc-25 had passed Visu Visu Point approximately half an hour previously, entered Kula Gulf, and was near Wilson Harbour, 1 miles offshore at the time of the engagement. On 16 August 1943, three aircraft attacked APc-25 and its convoy at low altitude. The convoy had just arrived at Enogai Harbor, New Georgia Island, and was unloading mailbags at that time. Approximately 12 bombs were dropped in the area. Two strafing attacks were made by at least one of the aircraft. One of the crew members of LCT-325 was hit in the right knee and his left leg was broken near the thigh by a shell fragment. Another member of the same crew sustained a superficial shell wound. A Japanese Zero floatplane strafed the PT boats that were screening the convoy on the same date, and then strafed the LCT-325 and LCT-327. When the aircraft came in at low altitude of approximately 500 yards, the LCTs opened fire. The aircraft dropped a bomb at that time and then proceeded in the direction of APc-25. The APc-25 opened fire with three 20 mm Oerlikon machine guns and two .50 caliber machine guns when the aircraft came within range at a distance of about 500 yards. The remaining guns were not in position to open fire. APc-25 fired about five magazines of 20 mm ammunition and about 150 rounds of .50-caliber ammunition. Some of the crew believed that the aircraft was hit after seeing a short burst of flame. Rev. Paul Redmond, chaplain of the 4th Marine Raiders Battalion found the remains of a Japanese aircraft the following morning, shot down on the shore in that area near Enogai. However, Commanding Officer John D. Cartano reported that he could not positively state whether APc-25 had shot down the aircraft. APc-25 reported much aircraft activity over Rendova Island and Munda, Solomon Islands. At least one Japanese aircraft was clearly illustrated by searchlights. Anti-aircraft fire was also seen over those areas. On 16 August 1943, the crew of APc-25 unloaded its passengers, cargo and mail and left the LCTs to unload the following day. The APc-25 departed from Enogai. They reported continuous enemy activity for several hours. Flares were dropped off Lever Harbor and aircraft were heard overhead at intervals until 5 a.m. in the morning. At one point, a Japanese bomber flew overhead, at low altitude of approximately 1800 yards, but was not within range. APc-25 did not open fire in order to keep its location undisclosed. No bombs were dropped. There were two PT boats that were most helpful to APc-25 and saved it from serious damage. When the Japanese aircraft came in for attack or dropped flares, these boats increased their speed and weight, and exploded smoke charges for the purpose of attracting attention and drawing the attack. This was in order to let the convoy get through safely. It was very effective in diverting the attack from APc-25. At least once, their smoke charges were heavily bombed by the Japanese aircraft. No additional damage was done to any of the ships. Robert Kelly, Commander Naval Motor Torpedo Base at Lever Harbor, New Georgia Island, reported 12 bombs dropped and three Japanese aircraft engaged in the attack. APc-25 anchored at Lever Harbor on its return from Enogai. It returned the next night to pick up LCT-325 and LCT-327, escorted the two ships back to Renard Sound, Russell Islands, and left of the North entrance on 18 August 1943. APc-25 arrived at Tulagi on 18 August, and discharged 74 ambulatory cases and three stretcher cases. Its mission was then completed. APc-25 then returned to Carter City for water. APc-25 was decommissioned on 13 May 1946 at Seattle, and struck from the Naval Register on 23 April 1947. Post-war career In 1947 APc-25 was sold to Bryce Little of Seattle, and then in 1948 to Coastal Trading Co. Inc. of Juneau, while operating under the name Coastal Trader II. In 1949 she was transferred to Canada and renamed Cape Scott while under the ownership of the Canadian Fishing Co. Ltd. (CANFISCO) of Vancouver between 1949‚Äì1972 and 1975‚Äì1985, and was also owned by several other Vancouver-based companies up until 2008, when she returned to American ownership, and was renamed Cape Cross. Fate On 26 July 2010 Cape Cross grounded on an uncharted pinnacle in Main Bay, Prince William Sound. A salvage crew removed fuel and oil from the vessel, and after being refloated she was towed to a point south of Seward, Alaska, where she was beached.

Vaikuntha-Kamalaja (or Lakshmi-Narayana) is a composite androgynous form of the Hindu god Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi. Though inspired by the much more popular Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati, Vaikuntha- Kamalaja is a rare form, mostly restricted to Nepal and the Kashmir region of India. Like Ardhanarishvara, Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is depicted as half male and half female, split down the middle. The right half is the male Vishnu, illustrating his traditional attributes. The icon symbolises the oneness or non-duality of male and female principles of the universe. Unlike the Ardhanarishvara icon much celebrated in Hindu scriptures, Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is mentioned in few Tantric and iconographical texts and no tale of the origins of this form is found in Hindu legends. Names The androgynous form of Vishnu is known by several names including: Vaikuntha Kamalaja, (Vaikuntha is the abode of Vishnu, here name of the Vishnu side and Kamalaja is \\"she who is born of a lotus\\" ‚Äì Lakshmi), Vaishnava Ardhanari (\\"the Ardhanari ‚Äì \\"half- woman\\" of the Vaishnava sect, which is dedicated to Vishnu), Ardhanari- Narayana (\\"Narayana (Vishnu) who is half-female\\"), Ardhanari-Vishnu (\\"Vishnu who is half-woman\\"), Ardha-Lakshmi-Narayana (\\"Vishnu who is half-Lakshmi\\"), Vasudeva-Kamalaja (\\"Vishnu-Lakshmi\\"), Vasudeva Lakshmi (\\"Vishnu-Lakshmi\\") and Ardha-Lakshmi-Hari (\\"Hari (Vishnu) who is half-Lakshmi\\"). Development Lakshminarayana statue from Nepal, 10th-11th century (Dallas Museum of Art). The concept as well as iconography of Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is derived from Ardhanarishvara ‚Äì the popular androgynous form of the god Shiva and his consort Parvati. P. Pal suggests that the concept of Vaikuntha-Kamalaja originated in Eastern India and then migrated to Nepal, however according to Deo, the concept originated in medieval Nepal, which D. C. Sircar refutes citing an 11th-century Gaya inscription. A late 11th century inscription of the local ruler Yakshapala in the Shitala Gaya Temple in Gaya, India says that Yakshapala built the temple to house a number of deities, including Kamalardhangina-Narayana, \\"Narayana (Vishnu) whose half body is Kamala (\\"Lakshmi\\"). According to another theory, Kashmir was the birthplace of Vaikuntha-Kamalaja. Although relevant Indian texts and icons of Vaikuntha- Kamalaja are found in Nepal, hardly any exist in India except Kashmir. Some notable Indian icons of Vaikuntha-Kamalaja are found at Bijbehara (late 10th‚Äì11th century), Anantnag, Kashmir; Jaintipur, Haryana; Baijnath Temple, Himachal Pradesh (1204 CE) and the Sayana Thakura icon of Jagannath Temple, Puri. Vaikuntha-Kamalaja icons are found in Nepal since 13th century. The earliest known Nepali depiction of Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is in a 1263 AD pata (cloth panel), now in the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Kolkata, India. Some Nepali bronze sculptures of Vaikuntha-Kamalaja are housed in some museums. Notable among Vaikuntha-Kamalaja icons are icons in Indreshvar Temple, Panauti; Narayan Temple, Patan and Saraswati Temple, Sankhu. While Ardhanarishvara's legends and iconography are recalled in the Puranic scriptures, Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is not mentioned in them. The Vaikuntha- Kamalaja is hinted implicitly in many Pancharatra treatises and Tantric texts. Tantric iconographic texts like Saradatilaka (10th‚Äì11th century-in a dhyana mantra -a mantra mentioning a deity's iconic form), the 17th century Tantrasara of Krishnananda (in a dhyana mantra) as well as the 16th century Shilparatna mentions the iconography of this androgynous form of Vishnu. Iconography and symbolism North Indian-style mural of Vaikuntha Kamalaja in Podar Haveli Museum, Nawalgarh, Rajasthan. As explained in Saradatilaka and Tantrasara, Vaikuntha-Kamalaja, like Ardhanarishvara, symbolise the oneness or non-duality of male and female principles of the universe. The Shilparatna specifically talks about the oneness of Vishnu and Lakshmi. It also denotes the combination of Sat (truth) and Cit (consciousness), producing ananda (bliss) (See Satcitananda). Like Ardhanarishvara, the left half is female signifying Lakshmi, the right is the male Vishnu. The icon is depicted standing on a lotus pedestal or may be seated on the Garuda or Garuda (the vahana ‚Äì mount ‚Äì of Vishnu) as well as a tortoise or Kurma, often associated with Vishnu, but aligned with Lakshmi as her mount in this particular iconography. Sometimes, the Garuda and the tortoise may be depicted kneeling to the deity on male and female side respectively of the standing deity. Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is eight-armed, has a fuller female breast and a longer floral-patterned waist-garment on the left, while the male half wears a plain shorter waist-garment up to the knee or a same length garment but with a different design. The Vishnu half holds the four traditional attributes of Vishnu: chakra(discus), shankha (conch), gada (mace) and lotus. The female half holds a kalasha (coconut-mango leaves atop a pot) or kumbha (water-pot) filled with gems, mirror, manuscript or book and a lotus. The goddess side may also hold a bell or a rosary. The manuscript and mirror are never associated with Lakshmi's iconography, however they are traditionally associated with other goddesses, suggesting their influence on the iconography of female side. The manuscript is the attribute of goddess Sarasvati, while the mirror is the traditional attribute of Parvati, especially in Ardhanarishvara icons. The necklace, anklets, waist-belt are common on both sides; the ear-rings, shape of the crown and arm ornaments differ.

It was based on a database of 55 private documents leaked by The Daily Telegraph that purported to show that Ed Balls played a central role in a plot, launched two months after the 2005 general election dubbed \\"Project Volvo\\", to oust Tony Blair as prime minister and replace him with Gordon Brown. The files included private letters between Blair and Brown, and also purported to show that the government went ahead with plans to increase public spending, despite receiving advice to the contrary. The day following the revelations Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell sanctioned an investigation into the leaking of the papers, after receiving a complaint from Balls, who maintained that the documents referred only to attempts made by him and agreed with by Blair and Brown, \\"to ensure a 'stable and orderly transition'\\" between the two Labour politicians. Background In May 2009 The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph published details of MPs' expenses. This led to a number of high-profile resignations from both the ruling Labour administration and the Conservative opposition. The release of the 66 documents in June 2011 was the second time in recent history that the Telegraph Group had made available to the public documents that could be potentially damaging to political figures. Balls had been a key figure in New Labour's economic reform agenda. However, he and Brown had differed from the Blairites in being more keen to stress their roots in Labour party intellectual traditions such as Fabianism and the co-operative movement, in addition to taking a modernising approach when it came to policy. The files On the evening of 9 July 2011 The Daily Telegraph published the first set of files, consisting of more than 30 documents, which allegedly showed that Balls, and to some extent Ed Miliband and Douglas Alexander, had played a \\"key role\\" in undermining Tony Blair in the wake of the 2005 New Labour general election win, \\"in a plot codenamed Project Volvo\\". The cache of documents also appeared to reveal in handwritten notes made by Brown his negative feelings towards Blair; material which had previously only been the subject of considerable media speculation. The following day, 10 July, the newspaper released a further 19 documents \\"obtained from the personal files of Mr Balls\\" which purportedly provided evidence that Brown took decisions to press ahead with increased public spending, despite receiving advice that \\"any increase in taxpayer expenditure should only be in line with inflation\\". Another memorandum appeared to show that Brown and Balls were warned \\"that plans to scrap the 10p tax rate would hit millions of poorer Britons and pensioners.\\" Denial of allegations Balls maintained both before and after the documents were leaked that he had not been part of a campaign to replace Blair with Brown. In July 2010, Balls dismissed as \\"total, absolute nonsense\\" that he had taken part in a coup to oust Blair, and in a BBC interview on 15 June 2010 with Andrew Neil Balls responded to the question \\"Andrew Rawnsley says the coup was not run by Gordon. It was run by Ed. Is that made up too?\\" by answering \\"Complete and utter total balderdash and rubbish\\". Subsequent to the documents being published by The Daily Telegraph, Balls again denied any involvement in any role to unseat Blair, calling the allegations \\"\\"false and mendacious\\" and saying \\"The idea that there was a plot or a coup is untrue and not justified by these papers\\". Balls claimed that his role at that time was to \\"hold things together\\" and that the differences between Blair and Brown amounted to \\"creative tensions\\". Media reaction In the immediate aftermath of the release, The Guardian stated that the controversy raised questions as to whether O'Donnell's investigation \\"will raise questions about whether the new government was involved in the leaking of the papers\\", an insinuation that was lent support by Michael White in the same paper. Toby Young, in The Daily Telegraph, wrote that the leak of the documents had shown that there had been a cover up and suggested that Balls' position as shadow chancellor was untenable. Steve Richards, writing in The Independent, wrote that \\"the documents are not incriminating. Indeed, the context in which they were written shows why it would be more of a shock if such memos had not been composed as Labour's long internal battle reached a d√©nouement\\". The New Statesman wrote \\"there is no doubt that they are damaging to the shadow chancellor. They contradict his public insistence that he never sought to undermine Blair\\", and also questioned the timing of the information coming to light.

Fertilization proteins are acrosomal proteins involved in various roles during the fertilization process. Structurally these proteins consist of a closed bundle of helices with a right-hand twist. Lysin and SP18, both characterised in abalone, are two evolutionarily related fertilization proteins that have distinctive roles. Following its release from sperm, lysin binds to the egg vitelline envelope (VE) via the VE receptor for lysin (VERL), then non- enzymatically dissolves the VE to create a hole, thereby allowing the sperm to pass through the envelope and fuse with the egg. Lysins exhibit species- specific binding to their egg receptor, possibly through differences in charged surface residues. SP18 is also released from sperm, acting as a potent fusagen of liposomes to mediate the fusion between the sperm and egg cell membranes. Despite a similarity in the overall fold, the variation in the surface features of SP18 and lysin account for their different roles in fertilization. The molecular basis of VERL-lysin interaction was revealed in June 2017 by researchers at Karolinska Institutet and ESRF, who reported X-ray crystallographic and biochemical studies of both species-specific and non- species-specific complexes between the two proteins.

Most widely known for his European performances in the 1980s. He is sought after in Hollywood for film scoring and now primarily focuses on piano composition. Early life and education Larsen was born in San Francisco, California, and began piano studies at the age of six. Composing music in his teens, Larsen graduated from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, pursuing a dual career as composer and pianist. He studied composition under John Adams and piano under Milton Salkind (Conservatory president) and Mack McCray. Post Conservatory, he worked with Peter Feuchtwanger and Ruth Nye in London, and Vlado Perlemuter (Maurice Ravel's assistant) in Paris. Musical style and compositions Larsen is known for creating a new style of 21st-century romanticism which combines 19th-century romanticism with influences of the 20th century, such as jazz, minimalism and world music. His group of compositions, Fantasia Suite, is seen as a Neo-Romantic reaction to the violence and dissonance of the last century, emphasizing beauty and fantasy with idealism at its foundation.Malibu Times, 27-09-06, Melonie Magruder, \\"A 'Fantasia' Vision\\", Malibu, California. He composed more than 150 substantial solo piano works in Fantasia Suite establishes Larsen as one of today's most prolific solo piano composers. These compositions represent a continuous cycle of cinematic, yet classically written music in a bold, new contemporary idiom. Andrea Van de Kamp, Chairman Emeritus of the Music Center in Los Angeles, declares, ‚ÄúFantasia Suite is the music of the future. Larsen is creating a breakthrough with his twenty-first century Neo-Romantic approach. He has embraced the summation of our classical culture in music, while exploding into another dimension of creativity.‚Äù Scott Epstein insists, ‚ÄúLarsen composes music for our age that is personal, deeply felt and sophisticated. Resisting conventional labels, his music pursues its own path with intense inspiration. It reaches us and reflects us. Larsen is a composer for out times.‚Äù In Larsen's compositions, the melody, harmony, rhythm and instrumental virtuosity attains a level of complexity that is richly satisfying. Larsen's approach to the piano, though modern and individual, has its antecedents in the pianism of the great classical and romantic composers. The music is sometimes vocal, sometimes orchestral and sometimes peculiarly pianistic in figuration. The forms are clear and accessible and the music is always at the service of the emotional content, whether serious or capricious, bitter or sweet, worldly or spiritual. Performances and appearances Starting in 1980, Larsen became renowned in Europe for his piano performances of the High Romantics. In particular, his interpretations of Liszt, Grieg, Rachmaninoff and Saint-Sa√´ns made significant contributions to the Romantic Revival and won acclaim from both audiences and critics.The Times, 21-10-86, Noel Goodwin, \\"Review of Carter Larsen at the Queen Elizabeth Hall\\"Der Bund, 10-11-87, \\"Der Londoner Pianist Carter Larsen im Berner Konservatorium\\" BernLondon Evening Standard, 27-06-91, Christopher Grier, \\"Romantically Inclined\\" Carter Larsen conducted and performed as soloist with major concerts including the Royal Philharmonic OrchestraHamstead and Highgate Express, 06-08-93, Nicky Bolster, London and the London Symphony Orchestra.Barbican Centre, London, 29-11-87 His featured presentation in London performing Chopin's music, was broadcast on BBC television's prestigious \\"Omnibus \\" program in 1986. Renowned for several world premieres and recordings of previously unknown works of Liszt and Saint- Sa√´ns, Larsen became the first pianist to make a complete cd recording of Saint-Sa√´ns' solo piano music in 1989. Carter Larsen established himself as a serious composer premiering four original compositions alongside the classics, which were first broadcast on the UK's Classic FM \\"Platform Live\\" in 1994. He also served as conductor in the 70th Academy Awards. Further expanding his musical influence, in 2010 Larsen was invited to perform during the Shanghai Expo 2010, at the Shanghai Grand Theatre June 21, the closing night of the International Film Festival and the Shanghai Music Festival. Larsen performed the classics, original compositions, and improvisations. It was the first time CNN had interviewed an artist for the Grand Theatre. The concert was covered by two television stations broadcasting to a total estimated audience of 500 million and included the Shanghai International Channel and the Shanghai Arts Channel filming a documentary of the concert.

The population as of the 2010 Census was 649.Virginia Trend Report 2: State and Complete Places (Sub-state 2010 Census Data). Missouri Census Data Center. Accessed 2011-06-08. History Dante (pronounced \\"Daint\\" as in rhyming with \\"paint\\", sometimes \\"Dant\\" rhyming with \\"pant\\" but never \\"Don-tey\\") was originally called \\"Turkeyfoot\\" due to the confluence of hollows. It was originally settled in the late 1700s and early 1800s by western frontiersmen. Explosive growth occurred in the early 1900s with the discovery and exploitation of numerous bituminous coal seams. Southern industrialist George L. Carter made it the northern terminus of the Clinchfield Railroad and the headquarters of the Clinchfield Coal Company, which began to mine the nearby hollows (mainly Bear Wallow and Straight Hollow) during the early part of the 20th century. As a result, immigrants from Germany, Hungary, Greece, Poland and other central European countries flocked to the area. In 1912, the construction of the Sandy Ridge Tunnel just north of Dante allowed the Clinchfield Railroad to extend all the way to Elkhorn City, Kentucky. The coal seams surrounding the community were largely exhausted by the mid 1960s and were closed in favor of new mines such as Moss #3 (A,B,C and D mines) in Duty, Virginia. Dante was mostly a decaying coal town until 2016, when a renewed interest from its residents prompted community organizations to begin discussions on a path to revitalization. This plan has included reestablishment of a general store and redevelopment of the many abandoned Clinchfield Railroad grades and mine tramways into ATV trails. CSX Transportation still operates the Dante Yard, and the Clinchfield Coal Company offices are now apartments.  Revitalization  In early 2016 the Dante Community Association was formed with citizens of Dante and representatives from Russell County. The goal of the organization is to promote the revitalization of Dante and the surrounding area by investing in infrastructure, economic development, and the community at large, they are currently in the process of applying for a planning grant. Geography Dante is located in northwestern Russell County. The Dante CDP extends west into Dickenson County to include the settlement of West Dante. The communities are located in the valley of Lick Creek, which flows south to the Clinch River at St. Paul, and is thus part of the Tennessee River watershed. Sandy Ridge, overlooking Dante to the north, lies along the Tennessee Valley Divide, with waters on the opposite side flowing north via the McClure River to the Russell Fork/Levisa Fork/Big Sandy River system, reaching the Ohio River near Huntington, West Virginia. Dante is north of St. Paul and south of Clinchco via Virginia State Route 63. Climate The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Dante has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \\"Cfa\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Dante, Virginia References External links * West Dante WPA Sewing Project Category:Census-designated places in Russell County, Virginia Category:Census-designated places in Dickenson County, Virginia Category:Census-designated places in Virginia Category:Coal towns in Virginia ","title":"Dante, Virginia"},{"id":"32046430","text":"Arturo Far√≠as Barraza (September 1, 1927 in Santiago, Chile - October 19, 1992) was a former Chilean footballer who played for Colo-Colo and Santiago Morning of Chile and in the Chile national football team in the FIFA World Cup Brazil 1950.

He came to prominence during the Australian federal election in 2010 when Australian Broadcasting Corporation director Mark Scott referenced his blog during a speech. He was subsequently outed by News Limited journalist James Massola, a move that provoked widespread condemnation and criticism amongst the Australian blogging community. After a break from blogging following his outing, Jericho has resumed blogging and providing opinion items for other outlets, including the ABC. Early life Jericho spent his early years in Cairns, including a stint working at the Cairns Casino as a table dealer. During this time, Jericho wrestled with the issue of taking money from problem gamblers, and \\"sent (him) very close to the edge\\". He later referred to his period working in the casino as \\"the most depressing time of my life\\". Jericho has an honours degree in economics and a PhD in English literature, which he completed at James Cook University in 2005. Between 2006 and 2011 he worked in Canberra in the Australian Public Service, mostly in the film-policy division. Among other things, Jericho has said that he has wanted to be Prime Minister of Australia, captain of the Australian cricket team and a winner of the Booker Prize, but eventually settled for just being a blogger. Blog Jericho began blogging as Grog's Gamut in July 2008, his first post being on the Tour de France. His blog primarily discusses classic films, sports and Australian politics, and has no fixed update schedule, although a new article is usually posted every few days. When blogging on politics, Jericho is frequently critical of Australia's conservative Coalition parties, and has been described as \\"partisan\\". Outing During the campaign for the 2010 federal election, ABC managing director Mark Scott cited a posting by Jericho in a speech on the topic of the media coverage of the election. Jericho's opinion was that coverage of the election had been driven by polls rather than policy, and that the public interest was suffering as a result. At the same time, Jericho attended and live-blogged the \\"media140\\" conference, which was also attended News Limited journalist James Massola. During the conference, Massola and Jericho were seated at the same table, although Jericho states that the two did not speak on the day. On 27 September, Massola wrote an article in The Australian entitled \\"Controversial political blogger unmasked as a federal public servant\\". In it, Massola revealed Jericho's real name and that he was an employee of the Australian Public Service, justifying the outing on the grounds that \\"The prolific blogger shows a strong preference for the ALP, despite the Public Service code of conduct stating that \\"the APS is apolitical\\"\\". In a follow-up article on 28 September, Massola expanded further on his reasons for naming Jericho, claiming that \\"the fact he had a partisan point of view, worked in the public service and wrote about his department was a matter of public interest\\" and \\"Jericho's decision to 'live blog' the Media 140 conference (was it a sick day, a day in lieu, annual leave, did he clear it with his supervisor?) made my mind up.\\" Reaction to Massola's article was scathing. Bernard Keane wrote in Crikey that rather than discuss the content of Jericho's blog, Massola had just launched \\"a malicious, hypocritical ad hominem attack on him.\\" and pointed out the hypocrisy of The Australian running anonymous opinion columns itself. ABC journalist Jonathon Green opined that \\"Jericho made the fatal mistake of making them angry, of impugning the conduct of Australian journalism during an election campaign in which the media slowly became a significant part of the story; not so much for what it did but for the debate it let rot and degenerate. Outing him is payback\\", while journalist Tim Dunlop argued that \\"It is not their (The Australian's) role to deprive someone of their privacy when they are engaged in a legal activity.\\".

However, there is no precise technical definition of what the terms mean and different authors disagree about the implied meaning of the terms and the relative rankings of the \\"strength\\" of the type systems of mainstream programming languages. Generally, a strongly typed language has stricter typing rules at compile time, which implies that errors and exceptions are more likely to happen during compilation. Dynamically typed languages (where type checking happens at run time) can also be strongly typed. Most of these rules affect variable assignment, return values and function calling. A weakly typed language has looser typing rules and may produce unpredictable results or may perform implicit type conversion at runtime. A different but related concept is latent typing.  History  In 1974, Liskov and Zilles defined a strongly-typed language as one in which \\"whenever an object is passed from a calling function to a called function, its type must be compatible with the type declared in the called function.\\" In 1977, Jackson wrote, \\"In a strongly typed language each data area will have a distinct type and each process will state its communication requirements in terms of these types.\\"  Definitions of \\"strong\\" or \\"weak\\"  A number of different language design decisions have been referred to as evidence of \\"strong\\" or \\"weak\\" typing. In fact, many of these are more accurately understood as the presence or absence of type safety, memory safety, static type-checking, or dynamic type-checking. \\"Strong typing\\" generally refers to use of programming language types in order to both capture invariants of the code, and ensure its correctness, and definitely exclude certain classes of programming errors. Thus there are many \\"strong typing\\" disciplines used to achieve these goals. = Implicit type conversions and \\"type punning\\" = Some programming languages make it easy to use a value of one type as if it were a value of another type. This is sometimes described as \\"weak typing\\". For example, Aahz Maruch observes that \\"Coercion occurs when you have a statically typed language and you use the syntactic features of the language to force the usage of one type as if it were a different type (consider the common use of void* in C). Coercion is usually a symptom of weak typing. Conversion, on the other hand, creates a brand-new object of the appropriate type.\\" As another example, GCC describes this as type-punning and warns that it will break strict aliasing. Thiago Macieira discusses several problems that can arise when type-punning causes the compiler to make inappropriate optimizations. There are many examples of languages that allow implicit type conversions, but in a type-safe manner. For example, both C++ and C# allow programs to define operators to convert a value from one type to another in a semantically meaningful way. When a C++ compiler encounters such a conversion, it treats the operation just like a function call. In contrast, converting a value to the C type is an unsafe operation that is invisible to the compiler. = Pointers = Some programming languages expose pointers as if they were numeric values, and allow users to perform arithmetic on them. These languages are sometimes referred to as \\"weakly typed\\", since pointer arithmetic can be used to bypass the language's type system. = Untagged unions = Some programming languages support untagged unions, which allow a value of one type to be viewed as if it were a value of another type. = Static type-checking = In Luca Cardelli's article Typeful Programming, Luca Cardelli, \\"Typeful programming\\" a \\"strong type system\\" is described as one in which there is no possibility of an unchecked runtime type error. In other writing, the absence of unchecked run-time errors is referred to as safety or type safety; Tony Hoare's early papers call this property security.Hoare, C. A. R. 1974. Hints on Programming Language Design. In Computer Systems Reliability, ed. C. Bunyan. Vol. 20 pp. 505‚Äì534. = Dynamic type-checking = Some programming languages do not have static type-checking. In many such languages, it is easy to write programs that would be rejected by most static type-checkers. For example, a variable might store either a number or the Boolean value \\"false\\".  Variation across programming languages  Note that some of these definitions are contradictory, others are merely conceptually independent, and still others are special cases (with additional constraints) of other, more \\"liberal\\" (less strong) definitions. Because of the wide divergence among these definitions, it is possible to defend claims about most programming languages that they are either strongly or weakly typed. For instance: * Java, Pascal, Ada and C require all variables to have a declared type, and support the use of explicit casts of arithmetic values to other arithmetic types. Java, C#, Ada and Pascal are sometimes said to be more strongly typed than C, a claim that is probably based on the fact that C supports more kinds of implicit conversions, and C also allows pointer values to be explicitly cast while Java and Pascal do not. Java itself may be considered more strongly typed than Pascal as manners of evading the static type system in Java are controlled by the Java virtual machine's type system. C# and VB.NET are similar to Java in that respect, though they allow disabling of dynamic type checking by explicitly putting code segments in an \\"unsafe context\\". Pascal's type system has been described as \\"too strong\\", because the size of an array or string is part of its type, making some programming tasks very difficult. * Smalltalk, Perl, Ruby, Python, and Self are all \\"strongly typed\\" in the sense that typing errors are prevented at runtime and they do little implicit type conversion, but these languages make no use of static type checking: the compiler does not check or enforce type constraint rules. The term duck typing is now used to describe the dynamic typing paradigm used by the languages in this group. * The Lisp family of languages are all \\"strongly typed\\" in the sense that typing errors are prevented at runtime. Some Lisp dialects like Common Lisp or Clojure do support various forms of type declarations and some compilers (CMUCL and related) use these declarations together with type inference to enable various optimizations and also limited forms of compile time type checks. * Standard ML, F#, OCaml, Haskell, and Rust are statically type-checked, but the compiler automatically infers a precise type for most values. * Visual Basic is a hybrid language. In addition to variables with declared types, it is also possible to declare a variable of \\"Variant\\" data type that can store data of any type. Its implicit casts are fairly liberal where, for example, one can sum string variants and pass the result into an integer variable. Visual Basic is weakly typed. * Assembly language, Forth can be characterized as untyped. There is no type checking; it is up to the programmer to ensure that data given to functions is of the appropriate type. Any type conversion required is explicit. * Tcl can be characterized as manifestly-typed: The type of a value is derived exclusively from its representation, the assessment of which is context-dependent. For this reason, writers who wish to write unambiguously about type systems often eschew the term \\"strong typing\\" in favor of specific expressions such as \\"type safety\\".

Biography  From the ages of four to eighteen, Grallier studied classical piano in Lens, France. During adolescence, he worked as a drummer with the amateur y√©y√© group, Les Chaps (\\"The Guys\\"). After some preparatory classes, he enrolled in the engineering school at the ISEN in Lille, where he met the bassist Didier Levallet through whom he discovered jazz. In 1968, with a diploma in electrical engineering, he moved to Paris. He played in clubs, most notably at the Cam√©l√©on, in a trio with Aldo Romano and Jean-Fran√ßois Jenny-Clark. He made his first recording in 1969 with Steve Lacy. For three years, he accompanied violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. His first album for Agartha Records appeared in 1970, on which he was accompanied by Alby Cullaz and Bernard Lubat. During the same he year, he recorded Pianos Puzzle with Georges Arvanitas, Ren√© Urtreger, and Maurice Vander. Due to personal problems, he withdrew from performing for a period of time. In 1972, he was invited by drummer Christian Vander to play piano in his group Magma, which he did for two years. Following that, he played with Christian Escoud√©, Fran√ßois Jeanneau, and others. For several years, he was the regular pianist at the club Riverbop. Here he had the opportunity to play Americans in Paris who were on tour, such as Philly Joe Jones and Steve Grossman. He performed at the club Dr√©her in Paris and at Magnetic Terrasse, usually in trio with Alby Cullaz and Christian Vander, but also with Barney Wilen or Jacques Pelzer. In 1977 saxophonist and flutist Jacques Pelzer, whose daughter Micheline was married to Graillier, introduced him to Chet Baker. For the next ten years, Graillier accompanied Baker. In addition, he played with √âric Le Lann, Philip Catherine, Jacques Thollot, Richard Raux, Jean-Pierre Debarbat, Alain Jean-Marie, Paolo Fresu, and Pharoah Sanders. He appeared regularly in duo with bassist Riccardo Del Fra and in trio with Alby Cullaz and Simon Goubert. In the course of his career, he accompanied singers Julos Beaucarne, Jacques Bertin, Maxime le Forestier, Eddy Mitchell, St√©phanie Crawford, Elisabeth Caumont, and Stella Vander. He died in February 2003.  Style  According to Graillier, he was influenced most by pianists Bud Powell, Bill Evans, and McCoy Tyner, and somewhat later Herbie Hancock in the Miles Davis quintet. But Graillier has also said of his influences, \\"Of course, the influences are there, but it is not worth talking about them, they are part of the normal evolution of any musician. A musician simply wants to play, regardless of his knowledge of the language. He is therefore obliged to learn the language that others have developed over decades and this language becomes more and more intelligible over time, just as a kid learns to write. Above all, the influence of the great pianists and musicians is mainly of value in showing one how to find one's own voice.\\" In his short autobiography, Le Monde la Musique (The World and its Music), Graillier cited a phrase from Pascal Anquetil, \\"There floats through all his music, a dreamy and sweetly drifting mist. A climate of peace that restores one on a summer night without knowing exactly why.\\" Xavier Pr√©vost wrote in the Dictionnaire du Jazz, \\"Michel Graillier constructed an internal dialogue of breathing that knew how to make room for silence.\\" Dictionnaire du Jazz, Bouquins, Robert Laffond, 2000  Awards * Prix Django Reinhardt Prize of the Acad√©mie du Jazz, 1978 * Grand Prix de l'Acad√©mie Charles Cros, jazz, 1983 * Grand Prix du Disque, 2000 * Prix Boris Vian de l'Acad√©mie du Jazz, 2000  Discography * Pianos Puzzle (Saravah, 1970, 1991) * Agartha (Saravah, 1970) * Ad lib (Musica, 1976) * Libra, (1976) * In a Spring Way, (1978) * Toutes ces choses (Open, 1979) * Dream Drops (Owl, 1981, 1992) * Oiseaux de nuit with Alain Jean-Marie (Le Chant du Monde, 1991, 2004) * Fairly ‚Äì The Complete Session (Le Chant du Monde, 1991, reedited in 2005) * Fairly (Le Chant du Monde, 1991) * Portrait in Black and White with Alain Jean-Marie (EmArcy, 1991, 2005) * Sweet Smile (1996; Sketch, 2006) * Soft Talk (Sketch, 2000) With Chet Baker * Mr. B (Timeless, 1983) *At Capolinea (Red, 1983 [1987]) *Chet Baker Sings Again (Timeless, 1985) * Candy (Sonet, 1985) References Category:French jazz pianists Category:French male pianists Category:1946 births Category:2003 deaths Category:People from Lens, Pas-de-Calais Category:20th-century pianists Category:20th-century French musicians Category:20th-century French male musicians Category:Male jazz musicians ","title":"Michel Graillier"},{"id":"32046464","text":"Regan Elizabeth Hartley is an American beauty pageant titleholder from Dover, New Hampshire.

The city is at the southern edge of the Maowusu Sands of the Ordos Desert, on what was formerly a strategic site in the center of the Ordos Plateau. Tongwancheng, which means the \\"city ruling ten thousand\\", is the largest urban center of the Southern Xiongnu that has ever been found. The city's ruins are well preserved and located in Jingbian County, Shaanxi Province, near the border with Inner Mongolia. The city has been surveyed and has had some elements restored, but not yet fully excavated. The city was built by around 100,000 Xiongnu of the Xia kingdom under the command of Helian Bobo in 419. Helian Bobo, also known by his sinified surname as Liu Bobo, was a descendant of the Xiongnu chanyu (\\"king\\") who founded their steppe empire in the 3rd century BC. Helian Bobo died in 425 AD, and Helian Chang succeeded him as ruler of the city. The Great Wall of China was built to contain the Xiongnu threat, and Tongwancheng was the main Xiongnu capital that stood on other side of that wall. The city was largely of wood construction and had very thick outer walls which were colored white with white clay earth and powdered rice. From a distance the white city was said to have had the appearance of a giant ship. At its center the city had a lake. Jin Shu gives us a contemporary eyewitness description of the city... :\\"The hill is beautiful, in front of it the plain is wide, and around this there is a lake of pure water. I have wandered in many places, but I have not seen a land whose beauty can compare with that of this place\\". Fresco of Sogdians from Central Asia in a religious procession, probably a Buddhist or Zoroastrian ritual, in an ancient tomb at Tongwancheng. At its height the population was around 10,000, likely to have been greatly supplemented by an encircling encampment of nomadic kin groups at certain times of the year. White cities were generally ceremonial and status centers built following conquest, rather than outright military positions, white being a holy color for the Xiongnu. Yet the thickness of the walls was certainly required since the city was originally built at a time of perpetual warfare. The threat was also internal as well as from the Chinese - for instance, Helian Bobo was attacked with an army by his deputy Helian Gui in 424 following a dynastic dispute. In 426, the Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei made a surprise attack on Tongwancheng. Although a brief incursion into the city succeeded only in burning the main temple, the surrounding hinterland was devastated. The city's site was on the fertile upper reaches of the Wuding River, but the river and lake died up, possibly due to deforestation that might be traced back to Taiwu's devastation. The city was then gradually buried by the sands of the desert. This 'wandering' (Wuding) gave the river its current name. The Xiongnu continued to live in the region until the 7th or 8th century. In 786 the city was besieged by Tibetan forces, and it was invaded by Jurchen soldiers in 1206. There is no record of the site in Chinese records after the early 15th century.

The MƒÅori women called her Mata Wiremu (Mother Williams). Early life Marianne Williams, n√©e Marianne Coldham, was born in Yorkshire, England 12 December 1793. Marianne was the oldest child of Wright and Anne Coldham. Wright Coldham and Thomas Williams (Marianne's father-in-law) were hosiers in Nottingham, and both were Sheriffs. The family had moved to Nottingham from Norwich. Her father, Wright Coldham, was an active member of the Presbyterian High Pavement Chapel in Nottingham. Wright Coldham received recognition as a Burgess of Nottingham in 1796; as a Sheriff of Nottingham in 1798; and as the Mayor of Nottingham in 1809. In 1810 Anne Coldham died and at the age 16 Marianne took over raising her three sisters, Sarah, Maria and Anne, caring for her blind grandmother Mrs Temple, the running of the mayoral household and acting as Lady Mayoress at civic events.

Edward Marsh, a member of the Church Missionary Society. Marianne and Henry shared a Christian faith and they joined the Church Missionary Society (CMS), with the decision eventually being made that Henry would become an ordained minister and CMS missionary in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand. In a letter to the Committee of the CMS of 6 August 1822, Henry said of Marianne: \\"she does not accompany me merely as my wife, but as a fellow-helper in the work\\".Sarah Marianne Williams.

Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand in Dictionary of New Zealand Biography (DNZB) The early years in the Bay of Islands Watercolour painting by Henry Williams of the CMS mission house at Paihia On 11 September 1822 Henry and Marianne and three children embarked on the Lord Sidmouth, a convict ship carrying women convicts to Port Jackson, New South Wales, Australian. After a short stay with Rev. Samuel Marsden, he accompanied them on ship the Brampton from Sydney to the Bay of Islands, New Zealand where they arrived at Kerikeri on 7 August 1823.Letters from the Bay of Islands (7 August 1823) p. 54 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2004) The CMS had an established mission at Kerikeri where they stayed while Henry and other CMS members and built a store of plank and timber and a raupo hut on Paihia beach. On 15 September 1823 the family moved into the raupo hut, which Marianne described as having the appearance of a beehive. In 1830 a more substantial house was built using lath and plaster.Letters from the Bay of Islands (3 September 1830) p. 192, (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2004) Chickens, ducks, goats and a horse were brought from Sydney. A garden was soon cultivated. Food was either cultivated or imported on the infrequent ships from Sydney. Pork and Kumera could be traded from the MƒÅori, however in the early days muskets were the item of barter which MƒÅori wanted to trade, but Henry Williams refused to trade muskets. The supply of pork and other food was withheld in an attempt to pressure Henry to trade muskets for food.Rogers, Lawrence M., (1973) Te Wiremu: A Biography of Henry Williams, Pegasus Press pp. 60 & 75-76Letters from the Bay of Islands (11 February 1824) p. 82 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2004) The protection of the mission by the chiefs of the NgƒÅpuhi The members of the mission were under the protection of Hongi Hika, the rangatira (chief) and war leader of the NgƒÅpuhi iwi (tribe). The immediate protector of the Paihia mission was the chief Te Koki and his wife Ana Hamu, a woman of high rank and the owner of the land occupied by the mission at Paihia. In 1827 Hongi Hika lead the NgƒÅpuhi against the tribes at Whangaroa which caused anxiety amongst the missionaries as they feared they would be caught up in the fighting.Letters from the Bay of Islands (14 Dec 1826) p. 121, (11-19 Jan 1827) p. 123-131 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2004) The fears of the missionaries were increased when some of the warriors of Hongi Hika, acting contrary to his orders, plundered and burnt the Wesleyan mission at Whangaroa.Journal of William Williams, (1 March 1827) p.89 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2011) During a skirmish Hongi Hika was shot in the chest by one of his warriors, which resulted in the missionaries fearing that they would suffer in the event that a muru occurred following his death (an attack launched out of respect for a deceased chief).Journal of William Williams, (1 March 1827) p. 89 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2011) On 6 March 1828 Hongi Hika spent his last moments \\"exhorting his followers to be valiant, and repel any force, however great, which might come against them - telling them this was all the utu, or satisfaction, that he desired\\".Journal of James Stack, Wesleyan missionary (and later CMS missionary), (12 March 1828) p. 99 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2011) The death of Tiki, a son of P≈çmare I (also called Whetoi) and the subsequent death of Te Whareumu in 1828 threw the Hokianga into a state of uncertainty as the other NgƒÅpuhi chiefs debated what revenge was required. Henry was asked to mediate between the combatants. As the NgƒÅpuhi chiefs did not want to escalate the fighting, a peaceful resolution was achieved. In 1830 there was a battle, at Kororareka (Russell), that is called the Girls' War,online at NZETCSmith, S. Percy ‚Äì Maori Wars of the Nineteenth Century.

The Paihia mission The missionary work of Henry Williams and his attempts to act as peacemaker in intertribal conflicts meant that he spent months at a time travelling through the North Island of New Zealand. Marianne shared mission responsibilities with her sister-in-law, Jane Williams, together they cared for and educated their families. Together with Jane Williams, Marianne set up a boarding school for MƒÅori girls;Letters from the Bay of Islands (16 October 1826) p. 112 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2004) and provided classes to the children of CMS missionaries in the morning with schools for MƒÅori children and adults in the afternoon.Letters from the Bay of Islands (6 Nov 1826) pp. 116 & 133 (Caroline Fitzgerald 2004) Schools were established in the communities inland from the Bay of Islands. Marianne trained and supervised the teachers, who included the wives of other CMS missionaries, her daughters, nieces or future daughters-in- law. In 1832 Marianne and Janes Williams, together with Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Fairburn, and Mrs. Puckey, continued in charge of the Native Girls' School, and of an Infant School at Paihia.

She played a role in the desegregation of the Boston public schools. Early life and education Sullivan Alioto is the daughter of Billy Sullivan, founder and long-time owner of the New England Patriots. She grew up outside Boston. She graduated from Manhattanville College. She has a doctorate from Harvard Graduate School of Education. Boston School Committee Sullivan Alioto taught school for six years before being elected to the School Committee, first as a teacher of disabled children in Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant, then at the John Marshall School in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, where she taught children with behavioral issues. While serving on the School Committee, Sullivan Alioto earned her doctorate at Harvard. She is credited with having been a dedicated member of the School Committee (an elected, unpaid job,) Sullivan Alioto worked full-time to improve the quality of the school. Sullivan Alioto was regarded as the \\"most liberal\\" of the five members of the Boston School Committee when, in December 1974, it voted 3-2 to refuse to comply with the order of Federal District Judge Wendell Arthur Garrity Jr. to desegregate the Boston Public Schools. At the height of the School Committee debates over whether to comply with the Federal Court order to desegregate the Boston Public Schools, in 1974 and 1975, Kerrigan was the leading liberal on the committee, as described in Newsday by reporter John Treen, \\"the argument is between Kerrigan and Sullivan. Sullivan is the most liberal of the Committee, Kerrigan the most vocally conservative. Kerrigan accuses Sullivan of questioning an appointment... Sullivan explodes.\\" The University of Massachusetts, Boston, in a report as part of its Collaborative History of Segragation in Boston, described Sullivan Alioto as \\"an outsider\\" who \\"entered the Boston School Committee in 1974 and completely challenged the status quo, altering the committee for the better. ... By taking a look at Kathleen Sullivan‚Äôs role in the move to desegregate Boston Public Schools, we gain an often overlooked narrative because of how she did not quite fit in with her contemporaries at the time.\\" Sullivan Alioto was succeeded on the school committee by her sister, Jean Sullivan McKeigue. Later career She was a Democratic Party primary election candidate for the United States Senate in Massachusetts in 1978, finishing third. Sullivan Alioto served as executive director of the Foundation of the City College of San Francisco. In 2016, Sullivan Alioto was a member of an advisory panel that recommended that the federal Department of Education sever ties with the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools because the group was accrediting predatory and fraudulent for-profit colleges. Personal life From 1974 to 1976, Sullivan Alioto dated the then-closeted Barney Frank. In April 1976, Sullivan Alioto's father suggested that, while she was attending a convention in San Francisco, she lunch with former San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto. She and Alioto married in 1978 and remained together until his death in 1998. Because Alioto was divorced, the wedding was performed by excommunicated Catholic priest and activist Joseph O'Rourke. Sullivan Alioto has two children, Patrick Joseph Sullivan Alioto and Domenica Alioto.

Recent molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, suggests that Gliophorus is monophyletic and forms a natural group distinct from Hygrocybe sensu stricto. It is therefore likely to be adopted more widely in the near future, as noted in the most recent (2010) European guide to waxcaps.

The album was released on June 7, 2011 by Telarc Digital label. Music As Hiromi says, \\"I called this album Voice because I believe that people‚Äôs real voices are expressed in their emotions. It‚Äôs not something that you really say. It‚Äôs more something that you have in your heart. Maybe it‚Äôs something you haven‚Äôt said yet. Maybe you‚Äôre never going to say it. But it‚Äôs your true voice. Instrumental music is very similar. We don‚Äôt have any words or any lyrics to go with it. It‚Äôs the true voice that we don‚Äôt really put into words, but we feel it when it‚Äôs real.\\" Reception Derk Richardson of The Absolute Sound stated \\"On Voice, her seventh album, Hiromi‚Äôs energy shines like never before. Much credit goes to Michael Bishop‚Äôs recording, which pushes the piano, synths, bass, drums, and cymbals right into your room where their presence‚Äîsharp-edged or rounded and burnished at exactly the right moments‚Äîpulsates against the silence. But Voice is more than one of best- engineered piano records this side of ECM; it is an hour of virtually nonstop excitement, rising to peak after peak, capped by a perfectly placed five- minute denouement that allows your burning ears to cool down.\\" Ian Patterson of All About Jazz commented, \\"Voice presents Hiromi as a maturing composer spreading her wings, confident and open to all manner of influences. This is a highly satisfying addition to Hiromi's discography, and one that leaves the tantalizing sensation that her already fascinating musical journey is maybe only just beginning.\\" Phil Wain of No Treble stated \\"We certainly feel it. Hiromi‚Äôs latest album, Voice is convincing music ‚Äì it has the air of authenticity, the musicians believe in what they are creating and what they have created here is a record that stands fairly unique, both in contemporary jazz and in Hiromi‚Äôs recorded output to date. You can hear the Ahmad Jamal influence fairly explicitly, while at the same time it‚Äôs definitely Hiromi‚Äôs voice here.\\" In his review for The Guardian, John Fordham wrote, \\"Though she can't resist hurtling through a jaw-dropping obstacle race of swing, classical adaptations and thundering blues, it's hard to resist the childlike glee with which she does it all. Voice doesn't feature any vocals, but the theme is her journey towards a voice of her own.\\" Track listing  Personnel  * Hiromi Uehara - Piano * Anthony Jackson - Bass * Simon Phillips - Drums References External links *Official website Category:2011 albums Category:Hiromi Uehara albums ","title":"Voice (Hiromi album)"},{"id":"32046802","text":"Darren Tarczon (born 28 February 1971) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Carlton in the Australian Football League (AFL).

A native of Bonn, he offered his services to Austria and won an award for bravery in 1790. While a field officer in the Italian campaign, he led the rear guard at Primolano in September 1796. Badly outnumbered by the French, he and his soldiers put up a vigorous fight until he was wounded and captured. At Arcole in November 1796, he commanded a brigade on the field of battle against Napoleon Bonaparte's French army. Promoted to general officer in the spring of 1800, he led a powerful brigade at Hohenlinden during that year's fall campaign in Bavaria. Though the battle ended in a decisive defeat, Gavasini's troops fought well before being forced to retreat. The 1805 campaign in Italy found him directing a reserve brigade at Caldiero. After briefly retiring, the warrior returned to lead a brigade at the battles of Sacile, Piave River, and Graz during the 1809 war. That year he retired from the army and did not return. French Revolutionary Wars =Primolano= Map showing the action at Primolano (upper right) on 7 September 1796 Born in 1762 at Bonn in the Electorate of Cologne, Gavasini joined the army of Habsburg Austria. He won the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 19 December 1790. It is not specified whether the award was given for fighting against the Ottoman Turks or the Brabant Revolution. By September 1793, he had risen to the rank of Major. His next promotion was to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 1 April 1796.Smith & Kudrna, Alois Gavasini In September 1796, Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser's army descended the Brenta Valley as it marched from Trentino in the Italian Tyrol to Bassano del Grappa in the Po Valley. Peter Quasdanovich, who led a division, dropped off Gavasini with a rear guard at Primolano near Cismon del Grappa to hold off Pierre Augereau's French pursuit. Gavasini's command included one 1,108-man battalion of the Michael Wallis Infantry Regiment Nr. 11, 561 soldiers in four companies of the Erbach Infantry Regiment Nr. 42, one 100-strong company of the Mahony J√§gers, a half- company of pioneers, and 90 troopers of the Erd√∂dy Hussar Regiment Nr. 9. Another column of troops under Oberst Georg von Stentsch arrived, bringing the total number of troops available to about 2,800. Gavasini drew up his troops behind an entrenchment in a narrow valley with a loop of the Brenta partly protecting his front.Boycott-Brown, 429-430 On 7 September, Augereau's division appeared and began attacking the Austrian defenses. After clambering over the ridges and wading the river, the French skirmishers soon put the Austrian position in peril. The 5th Light and the 4th Line Infantry Demi- Brigades soon forced Gavasini to pull back to the Covelo fort, which perched atop an outcrop high. The 5th Light circled the Austrian left flank, while a strong party of the 4th Line climbed to a site on the Austrian right rear where it poured fire into the fort. After holding out for an hour, the wounded Gavasini led his men out of the trap only to fall captive to √âdouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud's 5th Dragoon Regiment.Boycott-Brown, 430-431 Against \\"light\\" French casualties, the Austrians lost 1,500 men and five guns captured in the combat, including the greater part of the Wallis and Erbach battalions. Austrian total strength in the area was 4,000, including the 9th Battalion of the Karlstadt Grenz Infantry Regiment, the 4th Battalion of the Warasdiner Grenz Infantry Regiment, and the grenadiers of the Pellegrini Infantry Regiment Nr. 49. Augereau's 8,200-man division consisted of twelve battalions in two brigades under Jean-Baptiste Dominique Rusca and Claude Perrin Victor. The Battle of Bassano occurred the following day.Smith, 123. Smith's list of French regiments is at odds with the units named by Boycott-Brown. =Arcole= Fanciful painting by Horace Vernet showing Bonaparte leading his troops across the Arcole bridge After being freed in a prisoner exchange, Gavasini rejoined the army for the third relief of the Siege of Mantua. His name does not appear in the Austrian order of battle, which lists six divisions of about 4,000 men each.Boycott-Brown, 444 On the morning of 15 November 1796, the French army of Napoleon Bonaparte initiated the Battle of Arcole by crossing the Adige River behind Jozsef Alvinczi's left flank. From there, Augereau's division drove north toward Arcole village while Andr√© Mass√©na's division moved northwest in the direction of Belfiore.Boycott-Brown, 459-461 In response to orders from Alvinczi, Gavasini moved his brigade to Belfiore at 11:00 AM. Leading the Spl√©nyi Infantry Regiment Nr. 51 along a causeway through the marshes, Gavasini ran into Mass√©na's advance at Bionde, midway between Belfiore and the French crossing site at Ronco all'Adige. At first the Spl√©nyi Regiment drove back the French, capturing two cannons. However, a second Austrian column under Adolf Brabeck mistakenly fired into Gavasini's men from an adjacent causeway, throwing them into panic. Mass√©na followed the retreating Austrians and temporarily captured Belfiore.Boycott- Brown, 463-464 On the second day of battle, Alvinczi ordered six battalions under Giovanni Marchese di Provera to advance from Belfiore while Anton Ferdinand Mittrowsky's 14 battalions attacked south from Arcole. At 5:00 AM, Provera's attack was underway, but it was quickly blunted by Mass√©na. The French skirmishers riddled the Austrian infantry formations and soon only the Habsburg cannoneers were holding back the enemy almost singlehandedly. Then Brabeck was killed and the entire force fled back to Belfiore, which the French captured again, along with five guns. Mittrowsky's attack also miscarried, but he managed to hang onto Arcole until nightfall after savage fighting.Boycott-Brown, 468 On the third day, Provera's attack on Mass√©na failed again and this time the Austrian position unraveled. The French general diverted the bulk of his division to help Augereau and the two finally seized Arcole about 5:00 PM on 17 November, thereby winning the battle.Boycott-Brown, 473-475 =Hohenlinden= Battle of Hohenlinden Gavasini was promoted to Oberst (colonel) on 4 December 1796 and to General-major on 6 March 1800. On 3 December 1800 he led a brigade in Michael von Kienmayer's corps-sized Right Column at the Battle of Hohenlinden. His brigade was part of Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's division and comprised one battalion of the Ligne Infantry Regiment Nr. 30; two battalions each of the Clerfayt Infantry Regiment Nr. 9, Beaulieu Infantry Regiment Nr. 58, and Murray Infantry Regiment Nr. 55; and three battalions of the Gemmingen Infantry Regiment Nr. 21.Arnold, 276Smith, 189. Smith lists only two battalions of Gemmingen. The battle ended in an Austrian disaster, but alone among his fellow division and column commanders, Schwarzenberg handled his division with skill.Arnold, 255 While some Austrian leaders proved irresolute, Schwarzenberg thrust boldly at Paul Grenier's left wing divisions of Louis Bastoul and Michel Ney. Gavasini's Gemmingen Regiment quickly seized the village of Forstern and had to be driven out. Schwarzenberg's fight centered on a series of hamlets north of Hohenlinden. The Murray Regiment carried Kronacker in an impetuous assault, lost it to Ney's counterattack, and captured it again.Arnold, 233-235 Later in the day, the French retook Kronacker before losing it again to a charge by the Murray Regiment. By this time, Kienmayer found out that the French had smashed Johann Kollowrat's Left Center Column and he issued orders to retreat. In spite of the difficult tactical situation, Schwarzenberg was able to withdraw his division in good order.Arnold, 248-249 Napoleonic Wars Archduke Charles at the Battle of Caldiero From 1801 to 1805, Gavasini commanded in Carniola, which roughly corresponds to modern-day Slovenia. His headquarters was located in Ljubljana (Laibach). In the War of the Third Coalition, Gavasini led a seven battalion brigade in Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen's Army of Italy. At the time of the Battle of Verona, his unit was assigned to the Left Wing under Paul Davidovich.Schneid, 164-166 After a reorganization, he fought in Eug√®ne-Guillaume Argenteau's Reserve at the Battle of Caldiero on 29-31 October 1805. His brigade included four battalions of the Archduke Rudolf Infantry Regiment Nr. 16, three battalions of the Lattermann Infantry Regiment Nr. 45, and eight squadrons of the Stipczic Hussar Regiment Nr. 10.Schneid, 169-171 Battle of Piave River showing 8 May 1809 afternoon positions Gavasini resigned from the army in 1806, but was recalled up to service before the outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition. At the beginning of the conflict he commanded a brigade of Landwehr that comprised two battalions from Trieste, two battalions from Gorizia (G√∂rz), and four battalions from Postojna (Adelsberg).Bowden & Tarbox, 108 After the eruption of the Tyrolean Rebellion, the Austrian high command dispatched Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles and a division to the aid of the rebels.Schneid, 66 In the consequent reorganization of Archduke John of Austria's Army of Inner Austria, Gavasini emerged as brigade commander in the IX Armeekorps of Ignaz Gyulai. His brigade was made up of three battalions of the Reisky Infantry Regiment N. 13 and one and one-half battalions of the Otocaner Grenz Infantry Regiment Nr. 2. He led this unit at the Battle of Sacile on 16 April 1809.Smith, 287Schneid, 182-183 The VIII Armeekorps of Albert Gyulai absorbed the main attack of Eug√®ne de Beauharnais' army while the IX Armeekorps waited in reserve. In the afternoon, Archduke John unleashed Ignaz Gyulai's troops and they pressed back the outmatched Franco-Italian left flank to win the contest.Schneid, 72-74 At the Battle of Piave River on 8 May 1809, he commanded two battalions of the Otocaner Regiment in the IX Armeekorps.Bowden & Tarbox, 113Smith, 300 None of the sources specify where Gavasini's brigade deployed. However, Albert Gyulai's two VIII Armeekorps brigades held the right flank near Mandre while Johann Kaln√°ssy's IX Armeekorps brigade formed the extreme left flank at Cimadolmo.Schneid, 81 Late in the afternoon, the Franco- Italian army broke through Ignaz Gyulai's line in the center and forced Archduke John to commit his reserve brigade of grenadiers. When these elite troops failed to stop their enemies, the Austrian army was forced to retreat.Schneid, 81-82 After the Piave, Archduke John retreated to Villach with his main body while sending Ignaz Gyulai to Laibach to sustain the defense of Croatia. After a reorganization, Gavasini found himself leading a brigade in Anton von Zach's division of Ignaz Gyulai's army corps. He commanded two battalions of the Otocaner Regiment, two battalions of the Archduke Franz Karl Infantry Regiment Nr. 52, and eight cannons of a 3-pound brigade battery.Bowden & Tarbox, 116 On 24 June, the Otocaner and Archduke Franz Karl Regiments skirmished with Jean-Baptiste Broussier's division at Karlsdorf, now a suburb of Graz. The troops also fought in the Battle of Graz on 25 and 26 June.Smith, 318 Gavasini retired again on 10 December 1809 and never returned to military service. He died at Klagenfurt on 28 November 1834.

The community between Fairfax City and Chantilly dates from the late 1960s, when it was developed by Levitt & Sons.\\"Greenbriar: Chantilly's Levitt town\\" The Washington Post, 2011-03-04. The community is famous for having only one road within its territory that does not start with an \\"M\\" or \\"P\\", which is Acorn Hill (added in 1994 with the addition of five mansions to the community). A popular (but not proven) belief is that the roads were named after the architect's two children. One drawback for residents of the community is that with nearly identical sounding named roads (for example, Mayport and Maylock) in such close proximity to each other and house numbers being the same, the US Postal Service along with UPS and FedEx sometimes deliver items to the wrong house. Geography Greenbriar is located in western Fairfax County, bordered by Chantilly to the west, Fair Lakes to the south, and Fair Oaks to the east. U.S. Route 50 forms the northern border of the CDP. US 50 leads east to the center of Fairfax, and to downtown Washington, D.C. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Greenbriar CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.54%, is water. Amenities The area has its own community pool, but pool memberships are not available for sale from the Pool Club. Instead, one may choose to purchase their membership from another member who is selling their membership. Residents sometimes list those memberships for sale in the community newspaper Greenbriar Flyer. As a member, one makes an annual payment to cover the costs of the pool's maintenance and staff, as well as for hosting swim meets for residents of other communities around Fairfax County. The swim teams at Greenbriar are known as the Greenbriar Dolphins. Unlike most communities which are bound to a homeowners' association, Greenbriar has only a civic association which collects a strictly voluntary $25 annual donation from each owner, which pays for events that the community hosts throughout the year, including Bands in the Park, where during the summer, local music groups will play for residents at Greenbriar Commons Park; as well as the annual community phone Directory. The Civic Association, however, has no bylaws for residents, which makes it attractive and a high demand-market community to live in within western Fairfax County.

After almost 40 years of debate and delays in building it, the City of Omaha built the Market House in 1904. The local National Guard squatted in the building for almost 20 years, and afterward it was entirely demolished by 1930.  History  The market square is a feature of many European and colonial towns.The World's Best Squares, PPS website, Making Places, December 2005 It is an area where market stalls are traditionally set out for trading of a variety of goods, commonly on one particular day of the week known as market day. In Omaha, there was agitation for a market square as early as 1860, but nothing happened for more than two decades. The 1846 plat for Winter Quarters and the 1856 plat for the town of Florence both included market squares. Today, the North Market Square Park in Florence commemorates the historic location.(1975) Omaha North Freeway Completion, Lake St. to I-680, and Airport Connector Serving Eppley Airport, Douglas County: Environmental Impact Statement. Federal Highway Administration. p. 2-82. = 1860s = Jefferson Square was platted as a park in the original Omaha City plat of 1854. Despite being the only park in city limits, it was often the target of ambitious politicians and others. For instance, in 1858 the Omaha City Council passed a resolution to build the first public school in Omaha in the park. In 1867, the city council changed its mind and recommended the building be removed, and it was. The next January, the first proposal for a market house in Omaha came from J. L. Williams, a government director with the Union Pacific Railroad. The city council accepted the measure with the stipulation that the City of Omaha could buy the building in six years. However, the offer was never enacted.James Woodruff Savage and John Thomas Bell Munsell (1894) History of the City of Omaha, Nebraska. p. 435. = 1870s = In 1870, an industrialist named Lyman Bridges first came forward with a proposition to build a market house on the square, which proposition was indefinitely postponed by the council.James Woodruff Savage and John Thomas Bell Munsell (1894) History of the City of Omaha, Nebraska. p. 438. In 1877, the city council held an election for voters on whether to establish two market houses, including one on Jefferson Square and the other south of Farnam Street. Many of the young city's leaders jumped on board with Lyman's idea. Experience Estabrook advocated the universal building idea, with one structure housing the market house, public offices, city hall and the police court. John A. Creighton suggested the market house could be beautified with trees, while John I. Redick suggested rent could bring in $40,000 annually.\\"Century flashback: Citizens consider building,\\" Omaha World-Herald. April 16, 1970. Voters opposed the plan and no further action happened.James Woodruff Savage and John Thomas Bell Munsell (1894) History of the City of Omaha, Nebraska. p. 438. = 1880s = In 1881, a former Union Pacific official named Webster Snyder proposed that he would personally secure money for a market house be built in Omaha's first park, Jefferson Square.James Woodruff Savage and John Thomas Bell Munsell (1894) History of the City of Omaha, Nebraska. p. 438. Costing US$200,000, Snyder said he could get \\"enough money out of New York and Boston to build a half dozen market houses [in Omaha].\\"\\"A Pretty Pile the Jefferson Square Market House to Cost Two Hundred Thousand Dollars Interview with Webster Snyder,\\" Omaha Daily Herald. August 12, 1882. Snyder's plan included housing the market house with a new city hall, and he committed to contracting popular Omaha architect Louis Mendelssohn to design the building. The plan was quickly dismissed by the city council. Snyder's plan hitched the concept to a 50-year-lease, and apparently the idea of forcing city offices to be located in the building for so long was unappealing. In early 1882, the issue was put to a public vote in which the ballot asked, \\"' 'Shall the city lease Jefferson Square for the erection of a market house and city hall. Yes or No.\\" The popular vote passed.[nebnewspapers.unl.edu/lccn/sn99021999/1882-06-08/ed-1/seq-4.pdf \\"Market house and city hall,\\"] The Daily Bee. June 8, 1882. Retrieved January 12, 2017. However, Snyder reportedly withdrew his offer due to the drawn out nature of the process, and the plan went nowhere. He also moved away from Omaha.James Woodruff Savage and John Thomas Bell Munsell (1894) History of the City of Omaha, Nebraska. p. 435. Snyder's proposal was cited by the proponents in the early 1900s effort to get a market house built.\\"The Market House: Councilman Prince Gives His Ideas on the Subject,\\" September 4, 1893. Development of the market house stalled by 1884, and nothing was built. The issue was raised again in 1887, this time with a glass and steel building rising in the middle of Capitol Avenue over a full basement, all of which would be packed with vendors. It didn't take off, either.\\"Market house project,\\" Omaha World-Herald. December 9, 1887 = 1890s = Beginning in the early 1890s, some advocates began calling for a market house to sell their wares. When the Omaha Commercial Club began canvassing local sources, they discovered many prominent Omaha families were shipping their own produce and wares directly to Omaha from Atchinson, Kansas, where there was a market square. They wanted that access to fresh produce and more for more Omahans, and began canvassing the county. A national survey of cities with market houses done by the Omaha World-Herald in 1894 shared responses from Columbus, Ohio; Indianapolis, Indiana; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; St. Joseph and Kansas City, both in Missouri. Each city reported wild success with their markets, quickly recuperating the cost of building them and easily maintaining their success over a number of years.\\"Ghost of a Market House It Rises up and Walks Once More into Open,\\" Omaha World-Herald (Published as Morning World-Herald), December 20, 1894. Only the Pittsburgh Market Square still operates today, more than 120 years later. Later, the citation of Boston's Faneuil Hall earning $85,000 annually around 1890 assuaged many concerns for the future of Omaha's market house.\\"The Market House: Councilman Prince Gives His Ideas on the Subject,\\" September 4, 1893. An Omaha City Councilman named Prince championed the cause. There were initial plans made to construct a temporary market to test the concept, but were killed within a month of the proposal to the city council. The next plan involved building a two-story brick building in the middle of Capitol Avenue, but after learning that other cities designated entire blocks to their market houses, that idea was nixed. In November 1892, the Omaha Commercial Club received permission from the City of Omaha to build the market house. In 1893, the Omaha Commercial Club set the cost to the city at $200,000 to secure the land and build. The market house itself was going to be 50 feet wide by 260 feet long. Made of local red brick, it was set to be two stories tall.\\"The Market House: Councilman Prince Gives His Ideas on the Subject,\\" September 4, 1893. Consensus on the location of the market house supported the Capitol Avenue location, with approval from a variety of figures including Alvin Saunders, the last Governor of the Nebraska Territory, who suggested there would \\"probably be three\\" market houses within a decade.\\"A Market House Popular the Lower Part of Capitol Avenue Agreed upon as a Site,\\" Omaha World-Herald. May 18, 1893. The 1887 City of Omaha Board of Trade reported that residents in the city still wanted a market house. People believed they would save money on produce and meats, and they thought a market house would bring those savings.<.City of Omaha Board of Trade. (1887) Annual Report of the Trade and Commerce of Omaha. p 17. = 1900s = The topic of building a market house didn't ever quite go away. A 1900 editorial suggested that the construction of the Omaha Auditorium should dovetail with the erection of a market house, perhaps even combining the two. It wound up being built in 1904 almost a mile from the site of the market house.Omaha Public Library. \\"Omaha Auditorium,\\" Gateway to the West. Retrieved January 11, 2017. In early 1902, the Omaha Grocers' Association stated their firm opposition to a market house. They were the force behind the present-day Old Market, which was housed in Dr. Mercer's buildings almost a mile away. Harry Fisher, the organization's leader, said that retail grocers would \\"fight the building of the market house to the bitter end.\\"\\"Combat Market House; An Injunction Threat Retail Grocers and Certain Property Owners Propose to Prevent,\\" Omaha World- Herald. November 13, 1902 A long editorial in the December 1901 edition of the Omaha World-Herald advocated locating the Market House in the middle of Capitol Avenue again in order to avoid the cost of land acquisition. Citing the advice of Senator Charles F. Manderson of Omaha, the writer was a grocer who signed the article L.V. Morse, and they had a concrete plan. Capitol Avenue was 146 wide at this point. The writer proposed two market house buildings, each 264 feet long, or taking a total of two city blocks, that were 40 feet wide. They wanted four rows of stalls in each one totally 176 stalls that were 12 feet wide and eight feet long. The lots would extend 40 feet into the street, leaving one lane on each side of the market for wagon traffic on market days. Advocating for two stories, Morse suggested the initial structure should cost no more than $30,000 to build. In October 1892, Dr. Samuel D. Mercer again led the opposition. He and a group of opponents sought an injunction against the Commercial Club building the market house. The group contested that there were four main issues: * The lifespan of the building's roof wouldn't be long enough; * Traffic on Capitol Avenue would be restrained too much by the location of the building; * The cost of the building was too high, the City didn't have the right to use general funds to build it, and the City's funds were too low;\\"That $15,000 for Market House City Attorney Connell Says City Has Legal Right to Take,\\" Omaha World-Herald. May 28, 1902. and * The City government didn't have the right to change the usage of the land from the original owner's intentions. They believed the land it was sited on wasn't intended for usage as a market house in the original plat of the city made by the Council Bluffs and Nebraska Ferry Company Dr. Mercer and his crew quickly pounced on the opportunity to launch a trial, which quickly veered public sentiment and legal favor against the market house. In early November 1902, the courts awarded Mercer an injunction against the market house by ruling that the City of Omaha effectively could not build on that specific land \\"in perpetuity.\\" It probably wasn't a coincidence that Mercer was a property owner in the area where the city's early markets were located around South 11th and Jackson Streets. However, on November 27, 1902, a local judge named Dickinson found against the injunction and approved the project. Mercer's group dropped their objections.\\"City Can Build Market House on Capitol Avenue Judge Dickinson Dissolves the Mercer Restraining Order,\\" Omaha World-Herald. November 27, 1902. However, another court case arrived within a year. = Construction = A year later Dickinson also ruled in favor of the idea that the City of Omaha could order produce sellers to use the market house. Grocers protested that giving up their neighborhood wagon stalls and spots in the warehouse district (present-day Old Market) would cost them business.\\"The diary,\\" Omaha World-Herald. September 4, 1978. p 35. On August 30, 1903, the Capitol Avenue Market House opened. It was Omaha's first public market house, and was competition to the private Omaha Wholesale Market House Company housed in Dr. Mercer's building at South 11th and Jackson. The Omaha World-Herald 's resistance continued, with a facetious commentary about the stalls staying empty a week after its opening.\\"Omaha's New Capitol Ave. Market House,\\" Omaha World-Herald. August 30, 1903. The new building was 240 feet long, with a single story for the first 140 feet and a second story over the second part of the building. There were dozens of stalls on the first floor, along with a restaurant and small storefronts underneath the second story. The second story had a meeting room.Benjamin F. Thomas (1905) Thomas' Revised Ordinances of the City of Omaha, Nebraska. Klopp & Bartlett Company, p 264. The grocers' resistance eventually worked though. After opening in 1904, within a year the facility was declared a failure by the Omaha Retailer Grocers' Association.Worcester Board of Trade. (1913) The Worcester magazine: Devoted to good citizenship and municipal development. Volume 15. Worcester Chamber of Commerce. p 243. Market house was apparently never used as a market. = Re- use and Demolition = Ideas were floated for the re-use of the building almost immediately. In 1906, a real estate schemer suggested it be used as an ice house. With the majority of the city's ice controlled by a monopoly, this salesman suggested the city form a public ice company to control the prices of ice.\\"Municipal Ice Plant in Old Market House is Proposed as a Check,\\" Omaha World-Herald. July 28, 1906 That plan didn't move forward.

Its lessons weren't totally lost though: In 1933, longtime city parks commissioner Joseph Hummel cited the case of using Jefferson Square in the city council's bid to replace it with a parking lot. When asked about the city's plans, he remarked, \\"It can't be done! Didn't they try to put a market house on Jefferson Square some years ago?\\" The implication was plain: In the 1880s, the court ruled against using Jefferson Square for anything other than a park, including the market house. Almost 50 years later, Hummel employed that logic against removing it.\\"End of Jefferson Square?\\" Omaha World-Herald. September 20, 1933.

Founded in 1978 by the regional council of Piedmont, it occupies a wide area between the Stura di Lanzo torrent and the north-western part of Turin and Venaria. It is the second largest enclosed park in Europe, with a surface of some 3,000 hectares, bounded by a 30 km long wall built in the mid-19th century by Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia, who had moved in the castle here (the Borgo Castello) the residence of his morganatic wife, Rosa Vercellana. The park included one of the last relics of the large forest which once covered the whole Po Plain. Fauna includes wild boars and deers. The park has also breeds of horse races which are considered in risk of extinction. There are many accesses to the park: the gate of the avenue Bella Rosina, Fiano and the gates of Robassomero: Oslera Cascina, Cascina La Falchetta and Royal Park I Roveri, and of course those from Turin. Borgo Castello Mandria castle The existence of a building in the wood is documented since the 18th century, when Victor Amadeus II of Savoy built here the stables of the nearby Royal Palace, within a royal hunting reserve active since the 16th century. Filippo Juvarra worked at the castle in the 1720s. In 1860 Victor Emmanuel ordered the enlargement of the village (designers included Ernesto Melano), turning it into a castle with a surface of 35,000 m¬≤. The new structure had a rectangular shape measuring 280 x 100 m with three internal courtyards. The king wanted here a private residence (not belonging to the royal estates) to live with his morganatic wife, Rosa Vercellana. An apartment was built for her family by Domenico Ferri. In 1861 the structure was expanded with the \\"Villa of the Lakes\\", a neo-Gothic wing and a fountain of a sea horse fighting a triton by Vincenzo Vela. All the edifices, similarly to the Palazzo Carignano in Turin, are in brickwork. In the late 19th century La Mandria and its buildings were sold to the Medici del Vascello family. After World War II, a testing track owned by FIAT, a golf court and a residential center were added. It became a regional estate in 1976.

The stations were branded as GET (channel number), for example, DDQ/SDQ was known as GET 10-4-5a. The network was formed as a response to rising programming coasts incurred by regional stations in the 1970s. The network was dismantled in the mid to late 1980s, although by the close of the decade, NRN/RTN and DDQ/SDQ were co-owned and at one point, DDQ's operations were to be largely based out of Coffs Harbour, before becoming part of the RTQ licence in the regional Queensland market. Today, they are now affiliated with metropolitan networks as part of larger ownership groups.

It was founded in 2005 by Rishad Bathiudeen. The All Ceylon Makkal Congress is a member of the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG). History Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) member Rishad Bathiudeen was elected as a United National Front (UNF), of which the SLMC was a member, MP at the 2001 parliamentary election. He was re-elected at the 2004 parliamentary election. However, the UNF was defeated by the newly formed United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) at the election. After the election differences arose among SLMC MPs as to whether they should join the UPFA government. SLMC MP Hussein Ahamed Bhaila defected to the UPFA on 18 May 2004. The SLMC suspended three MPs - M. N. Abdul Majeed, Rishad Bathiudeen and Bhaila and - over their opposition to the leadership of Rauff Hakeem. The SLMC started disciplinary proceedings against the three MPs and party activist M. Inamullah. The quartet were expelled from SLMC on 30 May 2004. The expelled MPs started legal proceedings to regain their SLMC membership and on 30 July 2004 the Supreme Court announced that it had reserved judgement on the case. On 30 October 2004 Abdul Majeed and Badhiutheen, together with another dissident SLMC MP, Ameer Ali, were appointed non-cabinet ministers in the UPFA government. Abdul Majeed, Ali and Badhiutheen were expelled from the SLMC on 23 March 2005 for accepting the ministerial positions. Another legal battle ensued and on 1 July 2005 the Supreme Court ruled that the three MPs expulsion from the SLMC was invalid. The dissident SLMC MPs founded a new political party, the All Ceylon Muslim Congress (ACMC), later in 2005. In January 2007 Badhiutheen was promoted to the cabinet whilst Bhaila became a deputy minister - Abdul Majeed and Ali remained non-cabinet ministers. Abdul Majeed rejoined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in 2007. Contesting under the UPPA, the ACMC secured three seats in Parliament - Badhiutheen, Hunais Farook and M. L. Alim Mohammad Hisbullah - at the 2010 parliamentary election. After the election Badhiutheen remained in the cabinet whilst Hisbullah became a deputy minister. The All Ceylon Muslim Congress was later renamed All Ceylon Makkal Congress (All Ceylon People's Congress). Farook left the UPFA and joined the opposition United National Party on 26 November 2014 in order to support common opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena at the presidential election. Ali was appointed as a UPFA National List MP in Parliament in December 2014. The ACMC left the UPFA on 22 December 2014 to support Sirisena at the presidential election. Hisbullah however remained in the UPFA to support President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Rajapaksa dismissed Badhiutheen from the cabinet. After the presidential election newly elected President Sirisena rewarded the ACMC by appointing Badhiutheen to the cabinet and Ali as a deputy minister. In July 2015 the ACMC joined with other anti-Rajapaksa parties to form the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) to contest the parliamentary election. Contesting on its own in one electoral district, Ampara District, the ACMC received 33,102 votes (0.30%), but failed to win any seats in Parliament. The ACMC did however secure five seats under the UNFGG - Ali, Badhiutheen, Abdul Rahuman Izak, M. A. M. Maharoof and M. H. M. Navavi.

He is the author of a memoir, Romantic Violence: Memoirs of an American Skinhead, which details his time as a leader of the white power movement in the U.S. An updated version of the story was published in 2017, titled White American Youth: My Descent into America's Most Violent Hate Movement--and How I Got Out. His next book, Breaking Hate: Confronting the New Culture of Extremism, was released on February 25, 2020, and provides an inside look at how extremists recruit the vulnerable to their causes, details Picciolini's disengagement process, and serves as a guide for how anyone can help intervene.  Early life and education  Picciolini was born and raised in Blue Island, Illinois, the son of Italian immigrants. His father was a hair salon owner and his mother is a restaurant owner. At age 14 in 1987, Picciolini was recruited to join the Chicago Area Skinheads (CASH) by the group's founder, Clark Martell. Two years later, after Martell had gone to prison for a second time, Picciolini became the group's leader at age 16. He facilitated a merger between CASH and the Hammerskins, a more violent and well-organized white supremacist skinhead organization. He would go on to head the white supremacist punk band, White American Youth (W.A.Y.) and, eventually, a hate rock band called Final Solution. Final Solution was the first American white power skinhead group to perform in Europe. The concert was held in a former cathedral in Weimar, Germany, attended by 4,000 people, and was made up of several other white supremacist bands. In 1994, Picciolini opened a record store called Chaos Records where he primarily sold white power music. He officially renounced ties to the American neo-Nazi movement in 1996 at the age of 22. Picciolini attended DePaul University later in life, earning a degree in international business and international relations.  Career  Picciolini founded another, non-racist punk rock band called Random55 after leaving the white power movement. The band toured with Joan Jett in the mid 1990s. In 1999, Picciolini began working for IBM. He eventually left IBM to start his own record label, Sinister Muse. Sinister Muse is part of the broader entertainment firm Goldmill Group. Picciolini managed Flatfoot 56, a Celtic punk band from Chicago and The Briggs, a Los Angeles punk band. After graduating from DePaul University, Picciolini spent time writing his personal memoirs about his experience as a youth involved in the early American white power skinhead scene. In 2010, he co-founded Life After Hate, a peace advocacy and counter-extremism consulting group, with former neo-Nazi, Arno Michaelis. That same year, he took over as the executive producer and general manager of JBTV, a music-themed television program and entertainment media network based in Chicago. Picciolini is responsible for changing the show's basic format, securing a national distribution deal with NBC, and earning the show multiple Regional Emmy Award nominations. He would stay at the show until 2012. In 2011, Picciolini spoke at the Summit Against Violent Extremism (SAVE) in Dublin, Ireland which was presented by Google Ideas and the Tribeca Film Festival. Also in 2011, Picciolini served as the executive producer and film director for the Smashing Pumpkins' DVD re-issues of Gish and Siamese Dream. He also served as the producer for The Frantic's music video for \\"Blackout Brigade\\" and, later, as the producer for Dead Town Revival's music video for \\"Johnny\\". Picciolini had previously served as producer for The Frantic's music video for \\"Audio & Murder\\" and for Dead Town Revival's music video for \\"The Rain.\\" Picciolini released Romantic Violence: Memoirs of an American Skinhead in April 2015. Over the course of his career, Picciolini has contributed to a variety of nationally broadcast programs as a subject matter expert, commenting on issues related to far-right, white supremacist extremism. He appeared on the CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley, on Anderson Cooper 360¬∞ on CNN where he discussed the Charleston church shooting, as well as several appearances on DemocracyNow!. He has also recently appeared on Chicago Tonight on WTTW, The Afternoon Shift on WBEZ, NewsMax TV's MidPoint with Ed Berliner, Al Jazeera, WGN Radio, and The Adam Carolla Show. He has also been profiled in online publications like Vice and The Blaze. Picciolini left the Life After Hate organization in August 2017, intending to explore international groups that encourage violent extremists to leave their lives of hatred and find better lives. He went on to establish the Free Radicals Project, a global, multidisciplinary extremism and violence prevention, intervention, and disengagement platform and practice. Picciolini has criticized president Donald Trump for sharing tweets by white supremacists, using \\"pejorative language to describe other people\\", intentionally instilling fear, and emboldening racist language, saying \\"It's as if Trump kicked over a bucket of gasoline on all of those small fires that have existed for 400 years and created one large forest fire.\\"  Awards and recognition  In his role as executive producer of JBTV, Picciolini helped the show earn five Regional Emmy Award nominations (three in 2010 and two in 2011). The show won a technical Emmy award in 2010 for motion graphics. In 2016, Picciolini won a Regional Emmy Award for his role as executive producer and director of ExitUSA's \\"There is life after hate\\" anti-hate campaign.

During the First World War, he was credited with being the first Royal Flying Corps (RFC) pilot to land in France, and of being the first RFC pilot to down an enemy aircraft. He was eventually shot down during Bloody April and died of head wounds in a German hospital. The aircraft he flew while a lieutenant, the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2, along with a plaque, hangs in the main hall of the Imperial War Museum in London. Early life Bay was the son of Colonel H.H. Harvey-Kelly (Indian Army), and nephew of General Lionel Dunsterville. Although the Harvey-Kelly family were from County Westmeath, Ireland H.D. was born in Devon, and lived a while at Berry Pomeroy, the Dunsterville family home in Devon. He attended Bedford Modern School with his brother Charles Hamilton Grant Hume Harvey- Kelly.The Eagle vol. xiii, no. 2 (July, 1916), p. 24. On leaving Sandhurst, he applied to the Royal Irish Regiment, joining them on 5 October 1910 and being commissioned on 23 October 1910. He gained his Royal Aero Club aviation certificate No.501 on 30 May 1913 in a Maurice Farman Biplane at the Central Flying School, Upavon. He was commissioned into the RFC Reserve on 14 August 1913 before joining No2 Squadron based in Montrose, Scotland, a new base set up to patrol the North Sea and protect the fleet. HD Harvey-Kelly. Taken 1913 Early war Lieutenant H D Harvey-Kelly seen resting by the haystack, was the first British pilot to land in France after the outbreak of war At the outbreak of the First World War, 'Bay' was with No. 2 Squadron RFC. They were ordered to cross the channel into France. He flew a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 from Montrose in Scotland and a photograph of his aircraft, with him lying next to a haystack smoking a cigarette, is in the main Hall of the Imperial War Museum in London. It reads \\"Lieutenant H D Harvey-Kelly, the first British pilot to land in France after the declaration of war, rests his BE2A near Whitby, Yorkshire, in August 1914, during a stop in a flight south from Montrose\\". No2 Squadron RFC, Harvey-Kelly top left Although his squadron took off from Montrose on 3 August for Farnborough they were scattered by bad weather and Lt Harvey-Kelly damaged the undercarriage of his BE2a (347) whilst landing at Kettering. He abandoned his aircraft and was assigned BE2a (471) from the central flying school, eventually arriving in Dover 9 August 1914. His historic flight was on 13 August 1914 from Dover, England, United Kingdom to Amiens, France in 1 hour 55 minutes. This was the first RFC aircraft to arrive in France.War in the Air, Volume I, 1922, (revised 1939) Page 286, W. A. Raleigh archive.org Whilst Major Burke planned to be the first to land in France, Harvey Kelly took a short-cut over some woods and landed just before him.The Fated Sky, Air Chief Marshal Sir Philip Bennet Joubert de la Fert√©, White Lion, 1977, Commanding Officer Major Charles Burke wrote in his diary: \\"Just as I was gliding down I saw another machine. Landed at 8.22. It was Harvey Kelly.\\" The route was straightforward, however given the limited range and reliability of the aircraft it kept close to points of safety: Swingate Down, Boulogne, south hugging the coast, then east along the Somme valley to Amiens. At 06.25 on 13 August, No 2 took off led by Major Burke flying Dover ‚Äì Boulogne. From Boulogne they followed the coast as planned ‚Äì except for Bay, who continued inland, apparently following a pre-planned cross country route. He landed, together with Air Mechanic Harris, in Amiens at 08.20, Major Burke arrived 2 minutes later. Although understandably annoyed at the flagrant disregard for his orders Burke took it as yet another example of Bay's playfully competitive nature and nothing further was said. A fellow pilot, Archibald James, described Bay as \\" .... the funniest man I have ever met. He kept me in roars of laughter the whole time\\". It's very likely that Bay's impact on Squadron morale also came into Burke's thinking. BE2 dedicated to HD-H-K, Imperial War Museum, London Shortly after, on 26 August 1914, he gained the first ever British victory in air-to-air combat despite flying an unarmed aircraft. By maneuvering as if to hit the German Taube 2, other aggressive flying and using his pistol he forced the aircraft to the ground. Having chased off the crew he set fire to the plane and took off. In the early part of the war this method of taking victories became a fad. Harvey-Kelly was a character well regarded by those who know him, as 'One of the \\"Mad Majors\\" whose doings became almost mythical among the infantry'. He always took a potato and a reel of cotton with him when he went over the lines. The Germans, he said, would be sure to treat him well if he had to land on the other side and they found him provided with such useful and scarce commodities. He reportedly had a habit of spitting over the side of his aircraft if 'archie' (anti aircraft fire) came too close, one day he came back because, he said, he \\"had no spit left\\". On 18 February 1915 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for \\"services in connection with operations in the field\\". He was promoted captain on 23 May 1915, and major in January 1916. Final Flight Harvey-Kelly was not due to fly on the day of his final flight, 29 April 1917. Partly due to a rule that Squadron commanders did not fly (although many did) and partly due to a last minute switch. He was instead due to meet with Commander of the RFC Hugh Trenchard and Captain Maurice Baring. However because Richthofen was operating in the area he went up and became a victim of what the RFC called Bloody April when they lost over 250 aircraft. SPAD SVII aircraft of type used when Harvey-Kelly was shot down In the attack HD Harvey-Kelly, with Lieutenants Hamilton and Applin, spotted eight Albatros D.IIIs. Although outnumbered the attack was pressed when Harvey-Kelly spotted six Sopwith Triplanes of No 1 Sqn RNAS. However there are conflicting reports of whether these engaged or sheered away. During the dog fight Major Harvey-Kelly being shot down by Lt Kurt Wolff of Jasta 11. Major Harvey-Kelly and Lieutenant Applin were reported as killed in action, although Harvey-Kelly died of head wounds three days later in a German Hospital. He is buried in the Browns Copse Cemetery, Roeux, France. His cigarette case and other personal belongs were sent by the Germans back to his unit, and then sent on to his mother and remain with the Harvey-Kelly family to this day. Personal possessions of HD Harvey-Kelly. Most sent back by the Germans after he was shot down Von Richthofen paid an unintended compliment to Harvey-Kelly as he perceived the new SPAD unit to have been a special squadron organised to deal with his Staffel.

Bhumika Chawla makes a special appearance and Sudha Belawadi plays a prominent role. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by A. R. Rahman. It ran for 175 days in India and overseas. The film is remake of the 2006 Tamil hit Varalaru that starred Ajith Kumar, Asin Thottumkal and Kanika Subramaniam in the lead roles. A. R. Rahman, who composed music for the original Tamil version, is the composer of the songs, with all songs except one being re-used from the original. Rajesh Ramanath composed the background score. The film was released on 27 July 2012 and opened to a large number of highly positive reviews from the critics. Upendra's performance of a Bharatha Natyam dancer and as an old man bound to his wheelchair was highly acclaimed by critics and is considered one of the best performances of his career. Godfather performed moderately well at the box office and was declared a \\"Super Hit\\". Plot Shivasagar (Upendra), a wheelchair user, has a son, Vijay (also Upendra) who is playful and irresponsible. To teach him a lesson, he sends Vijay to Bhamapura to help the poor. Vijay doesn't want to go, but a local pizza restaurateur convinces Vijay and his friends that the village is one big brothel. In reality, Bhamapura is a sacred village and the restaurateur had purposefully deceived Vijay and his friends. Divya (Soundarya Jayamala) and her classmates also visit the village. They come for their social activity course to improve the village's health and hygiene. A large building is reserved for him and the girls are asked to stay in the poor families' houses. Vijay and his friends arrive and start to woo the girls, whom they mistake for Bhamapura's prostitutes. When Divya discovers their plan, she and her friends decide to teach Vijay and his friends a lesson. Vijay and his friends are wooed by Divya and the other girls. They are led to separate rooms where the girls inject a serum that makes them itch all over. They leave, screaming and scratching. Vijay tells Divya to leave her profession and offers to save her honour by marrying her in the village temple the next day. Divya doesn't come, but Vijay and his friends happen to see her leaving on a bus bearing the name of the girls' college, revealing that they have been duped. When Vijay returns home, Shivsagar discovers that his son has fallen in love. With his influence, Vijay and Divya get engaged. Later, Vijay goes to Divya's house in a drunken state. Her family prevent him from talking to her. This eventually leads to a fight. Vijay then goes to Divya's cousin's house to meet Divya and apologise for his behaviour but suddenly attempts to rape Divya's cousin. Then on the same day at night, Vijay tries to kill Shivasagar, but is luckily stopped by Ko Thanda (Ramesh Bhat) and is stabbed by Vijay. Disappointed with Vijay's behaviour, Shivasagar sends Vijay to a therapist. Here enters Ajay (Upendra's third role), Vijay's twin. Assuming Vijay's identity, he had taken money from the bank, got drunk and went to Divya's place and attempted to rape Divya's cousin. Ajay hates Shivasagar for leaving him and his mentally-challenged mother (Catherine Tresa). Later, Divya manages to sneak into Vijay's room in the hospital and believes his explanation that he is innocent. She leaves and shortly afterwards, Ajay appears, smuggles and dumps Vijay out of the hospital, takes over his identity and goes to kill Shivasagar. The father notices that it's not his son and gets out of his wheelchair to defend himself. Vijay arrives at the scene, surprised that his father is able to walk and demands an explanation. Shivasagar tells him that he was a dancer who behaved effeminately due to dancing. His mother had arranged for Shivasagar to marry her friend's daughter (Ajay's mother). He agreed but the girl rejected Shivasagar for being too feminine and insults him in front of the wedding crowd. Unable to bear the embarrassment, Shivasagar's mother died on the spot. Shivasagar, enraged, raped the girl, a deed that resulted in her becoming pregnant. The doctor refused to give her an abortion and so Vijay was born. Shivasagar takes his child from her mother saying the child would be the only hope of his life. Shivasagar says he is ignorant of Ajay's existence and the reason for his resemblance to them. Ajay escapes and threatens Vijay and Divya's wedding. Shivasagar attempts to stop him when Ajay's grandmother arrives and explains that Ajay is also Shivasagar's son and Vijay's twin and that Ajay's mother went mad when Ajay was about to get hit by a lorry. Ajay realises his mistake. He wants Shivasagar to shoot him, but the police misunderstand and think that Ajay is pointing a gun at Shivasagar and they fire at Ajay. Shivasagar intervenes and is shot instead. Ajay accepts Shivasagar's apology and is then arrested. Ajay's mother does not accept food from anyone, until Vijay comes dressed up as Ajay and feeds her. The film ends with Vijay stating that Shivasagar is the godfather of the family.

Another budding actress, Catherine Tresa was also roped in to reprise the role originally played by Kanika Subramaniam in the Tamil version. It was P. C. Sreeram who insisted his longtime friend A. R. Rahman compose the music for the movie. Initial reports wrongly reported that cinematographer P. C. Sreeram would be the director of the film.

The soundtrack album became very popular, and received highly positive critical reviews and met with many positive responses from audiences. Rahman got his first nomination in Kannada, by getting nominated in the Best Music Director category in the 2nd SIIMA Awards. Release As Upendra played lead roles in two films Katari Veera Surasundarangi and Godfather, the producers of those films had discussions over the back-to-back release of two films with the same lead actor. As per reports, the producer pushed the release date of Godfather to 3 May 2012. However, the mounting spar of the tussle over which film must release first was left unsolved. KFCC, part of South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce intervened the matter and stated that the film getting censored first would be released first. The producer of the film stated the production to be continuing for over 12 months and naturally wanted Godfather to release before Katari Veera Surasundarangi. The release was rescheduled in the second week of May 2012. However, after several rounds of discussions, avoiding clashes with Upendra's other films, the release was confirmed for the second week of June 2012 as censoring was pending. The production house was unsatisfied with promotional activities done before release of the film, and the release date was pushed to 27 July 2012.

The current church was built in 1612 by Augustinian friars to replace a wooden chapel. It also serves as the seat or central church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Laoag. History The first church of Laoag was made of wood and thatch when the Augustinians established the parish in 1580. The foundations of the current church was laid on 1612. It was damaged by fire in 1843 and was restored from 1873 to 1880 by the Obras Publicas under Engineer Antonio de la Camara and Father Santiago Muniz. The church was occupied by the revolutionists in 1898, and by the American forces in 1899. The ownership of the church was contested by the Aglipayans from the Roman Catholic from which the Catholic church won ownership. The church facade was renovated by adding lime plaster in 1936. It became a cathedral when the Diocese of Laoag was created in 1961. The church was again renovated from 1971 to 1972. It was slightly damaged by an earthquake in 1983. Features The Sinking Bell Tower The church is known for its Italian Renaissance design. It also has an unusual two-storey fa√ßade, supported by two pairs of columns on each side of the arched entrance. The top of the fa√ßade holds a recessed niche that showcases the image of the city's patron saint, San Guillermo el Ermita√±o. It has windows made from capiz with wrought iron screens.

Birth Born in Copenhagen on 12 January 1787, Peter Nicolay Skibsted was the son of the brewer and alderman, Andreas Skibsted. Early career Skibsted entered the Danish Navy in 1798 as a volunteer cadet; he formally enrolled as a cadet in 1799 at the age of 12. He was a good swimmer and his senior officer reported in July 1801 that he had completed a swim of 2880 alen (1800 meters in modern measurement) in 63 minutes. In 1802 he received a promotion to junior lieutenant, which led to his service on Friderichssteen in the Danish West Indies in 1803 and 1804. From 1806 to late February 1808 Skibsted taught at the Naval Cadet Academy. He spent part of his time on Prins Christian Frederik, a ship-of-the-line that was then serving also as a cadet training ship. Skibsted interrupted his teaching in August and September 1807 with service as commander of the gunboat Holb√¶k at the defence of Copenhagen.After the British had defeated the Danes the British took Fredericksteen into service. British records show the gunboat Holb√¶k as having been surrendered and destroyed. However, Danish records have Holbek running aground in Norway with the Norwegians later recovering her and adding her to their gunboat squadrons. In 1808 Skibsted commanded the gunboat Nyk√∏bing at Ulfshale, south of Copenhagen. On 9 December 1808 he was promoted to senior lieutenant.Tops√∏e-Jensen og Marquard, Vol. 2, pp. 519-20. Assault By 1809 Skibsted was commanding officer of a squadron of gunboats based at Kors√∏r in the Great Belt. It was here that a local blacksmith, Knud Eskildsen, laid charges of assault against him. Reportedly, Skibsted struck the blacksmith, who had been extremely rude to him in the presence and hearing of many of Skibsted's crew. Although his senior officer reported that Peter Skibsted never lost his temper, and that the blacksmith was known to be a very impertinent fellow, the court found Skibsted guilty of unlawful and violent assault. In judgement, the court fined Skibsted one month‚Äôs pay ‚Äì to be donated to the hospital for injured sailors ‚Äì plus court costs. 1810 ‚Äì success and failure By 13 April 1810, Skibsted was stationed in the Kattegat. On that day his four gunboats were escorting a small fleet of merchant ships from Udbyh√∏j at the mouth of Randers fjord southward to the island of Sams√∏ when a British gunboat sought to raid the convoy. Skibsted initially concealed his gunboats behind the merchant ships. Then when the British ship (which turned out to be ) was close enough, the Danes were able to capture her after 90 minutes of hard rowing in the relatively windless air.With I P pp119-120 The press of Denmark, Germany and Great Britain reported Skibsted's capture of Grinder,The Times, 14 May 1810.Morning Chronicle (London), 14 May 1810. and it was to this achievement that Skibsted owed his appointment on 28 May 1810 as senior officer of a squadron of three newly completed armed luggers: Husaren, L√∏beren and Flink.Garde p552 Senior Lieutenant N. H. Tuxen, who in the previous year had captured the brig , became captain of L√∏beren. Acting Lieutenant Thaysen commanded Flink. Each lugger carried one long gun and four brass howitzers, and had a crew of 28 men. Skibsted decided to follow the safer route south and west from Copenhagen via B√∏gestr√∏m, Svendborgsund, the Little Belt and Aarhus Bay to get the squadron safely to the hunting grounds of the Kattegat off eastern Jutland. Unfortunately, he encountered , and , which chased him into the harbour of Gren√•. Skibsted planned to load provisions and thereafter travel at night northwards, hugging the land. To protect his ships while they were at Gren√•, he received the assistance of a company of troops who were in barracks there. The troops, together with some field guns, were stationed on shore nearby. However, before Skibsted could implement his plan to leave, a little after midnight 10 enemy boats, some equipped with carronades, and manned by some 200 sailors and marines attacked the Danish luggers. The attackers heavily outnumbered the Danes, who also were not as experienced at close combat. As soon as the enemy came into sight Skibsted brought his luggers as close to the shore as he could. Unfortunately, the luggers could not get near enough to land to be well-supported by the soldiers. The British opened fire on the luggers with grape shot from the carronades and with small-arms fire, which the Danes could only return with their howitzers and small arms, as they were unable to bring the luggers‚Äô guns to bear on the British boats. The British came alongside the luggers and now the troops on shore had to check their fire for fear of hitting their own countrymen. The defenders on the three luggers were soon overwhelmed. Almost one third of the Danes were casualties in that six had been killed and Tuxen and Thaysen and 14 other men were wounded. The British losses were one dead and three wounded. Despite fire form the soldiers on the shore, the enemy refloated their prizes and took them out to where the ships-of-the-line were anchored two miles away.C F Wandell pp. 260-261 The Danish record agrees in its essential details with a letter in London Gazette from Captain Pointz of Edgar.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 24, pp.255-6. Prize money was paid in 1812.The London Gazette report of 25 February 1812 makes two mistakes in the spelling of the captured ships' names and quotes the date of the battle incorrectly as occurring in September 1810 when all other evidence is that it took place on the 7 July 1810, with the climax in the very early hours of 8 July 1810. After the battle Lieutenant Skibsted was taken on board Edgar along with the other prisoners, some to be exchanged and some to be held as prisoners of war. On 19 July a decision was made by the (Danish) Admiralty that Skibsted should face a court martial on his return from captivity. Skibsted arrived as a prisoner at Yarmouth on 7 August 1810, from where he was taken to Northampton. One year later, on 26 August 1811, he was released and returned to the Fredericksv√¶rn Naval Headquarters. After a few days service at Arendal he returned to Copenhagen to the court of inquiry into the loss of the three luggers. The court ordered that he receive a reprimand and pay court costs. Six months later, on 2 April 1812, a royal decree released him from any threat of further action relating to the events at Gren√• but still required him to repay the court costs.Tops√∏e's book records that full details are held in Danish Admiralty archives at reference I.S.Adm. 802/1812 Thereafter he served with the gunboat flotilla at Helsing√∏r, where there may have been some degree of ill-feeling as Skibsted complained of being refused service at a restaurant in the town.

His widow, whom he married in 1813, continued to receive a pension until his three sons had been commissioned as naval officers, or had otherwise left the naval cadet corps.

He was born at Barr, on 23 January 1697, the second son of Thomas Fisher, minister of Rhynd. He was educated at University of Glasgow. He was licensed by the Presbytery of Perth on 31 October 1722 and subsequently called (5 October) and ordained on 23 December 1725. He dissented and joined with his father-in-law Ebenezer Erskine in his appeal and complaint to the Assembly of 1733. He was one of the four original members of the Associate Presbytery founded at Gairney Bridge on 6 December 1733. He was deposed by the General Assembly on 15 May 1740, but continued to preach in the parish church till 13 August 1741, when he was forcibly ejected on a sheriff's warrant. He then preached in a tent on Kinclaven brae during the time he remained in the district. On 8 October 1741 he became minister of Shuttle Street Associate Congregation, Glasgow (later Greyfriars United Free Church). He was deposed by the Associate (Antiburgher) Synod on 4 August 1748 over the question of the Burgess Oath. He was appointed Professor of Divinity by the Associate (Burgher) Synod in 1749. He died on 28th September 1775. Life Fisher was born on 23 January 1697 at Barr, Ayrshire, where his father, Thomas, was minister, studied at Glasgow University, and was ordained minister of Kinclaven, Perthshire, in 1725. In 1727 he married the daughter of the Rev. Ebenezer Erskine of Portmoak, Kinross-shire, with whom he was afterwards associated as a founder of the secession body. Fisher concurred with Erskine and other likeminded ministers in their views both as to patronage and doctrine, and in opposition to the majority of the general assembly, by whom their representations were wholly disregarded. In 1732 Erskine preached a sermon at the opening of the synod of Perth, in which he boldly denounced the policy of the church as unfaithful to its Lord and Master. For this he was rebuked by the general assembly; but against the sentence he protested, and was joined by three ministers, of whom Fisher was one. The protest was declared to be insulting, and the ministers who signed it were thrust out of the church, and ultimately formed the Associate Presbytery. The people of Kinclaven adhered almost without exception to their minister, and the congregation increased by accessions from neighbouring parishes. Fisher was subsequently translated to Glasgow (8 October 1741), but was deposed by the associate Anti-Burgher synod 4 August 1748. In 1749 the associate burgher synod gave him the office of professor of divinity. It is in question whether died on the 28th or 29th day of September, at the age of seventy-eight in either case. Family He married 4 July 1727, Jean (died 1st Dec. 1771), daughter of Ebenezer Erskine, minister of Portmoak, and had issue ‚Äî Ebenezer, born 1739, died at Newbern, North Carolina, 1767 ; Ralph, West India' merchant, born 1743, died 1792 ; Margaret, born 1745 (married 1768, Walter Ewing Maclae of Cathkin), died 1815; Jean (marr. 1754, James Erskine, minister of Secession Church, Stirling), died 1762 ; Alison (married Robert Campbell, Secession minister, Stirling); Ann (married 1773, William Wardlaw, Glasgow); Mary (marr., proc. 22nd May 1763, John Gray, printer, Edinburgh); and eight others. Works Fisher's eponymous catechism was designed to explain the Shorter Catechism of the Westminster Assembly. Fisher's Catechism (2 parts, Glasgow, 1753, 1760) was the result of contributions by many ministers of the body, which were made use of by the Erskine brothers (Ebenezer and Ralph) and Fisher. Fisher survived the other two and gave final form to the work, which passed through many editions; it was long the manual for catechetical instruction in the secession church; and it was a favourite with evangelicals outside the secession such as John Colquhoun of Leith (1748‚Äì1827) and Robert Haldane.

Having few other options, he joined the Royal Navy as a boy seaman in 1923 after time at the training centre for boys at Shotley in Suffolk.Invergordon Mutineer. Despite the low pay and low peacetime prospects, the navy provided him with a degree of security. His service record up to the end of 1929 is at The National Archives (piece ADM 188/861) and shows a model seaman. Invergordon Mutiny, September 1931 In September 1931, as part of its attempts to deal with the Great Depression, the new National Government launched cuts to public spending. Navy spending cuts were translated into a 10% pay cut (matching 10% cuts across the board for public sector workers). However, the cuts were not applied equally to all ranks. Sailors of the Atlantic Fleet, arriving at Invergordon (on the Cromarty Firth in Scotland) in the afternoon of Friday 11 September, learned about the cuts from newspaper reports. Wincott ‚Äì then a 24-year-old able seaman serving on the Norfolk, organised meetings which prevented the cruiser from moving for two days.Invergordon Mutineer.

Although the mutiny was entirely peaceful, the Royal Navy imprisoned dozens of the ringleaders and dismissed hundreds more, Wincott among them.Socialist Worker: Retrospective article on Invergordon Communist Party activist Shortly after being discharged from the Royal Navy, he became involved with the Communist Party speaking at meetings up and down Britain. During this time according to The National Archives, he was being followed, and his mail was intercepted by MI5.The National Archives Wincott mentions in his memoirs that he was aware of being followed and of his letters being read, he named one of the informers as disaffected shipmate, Terry Gentry. Partly as a result of being under surveillance by MI5, he decided to defect to the Soviet Union in 1934. In his memoirs he claims to have done so on the advice of Harry Pollitt the General Secretary of the British Communist Party, who reportedly assured him that it was only a matter of time till the whole world became Communist, and that he was lucky to jump the queue.Invergordon Mutineer. In the Soviet Union In the Soviet Union, Wincott was given the status of a hero and received VIP treatment. Soviet propaganda elevated him to a symbol of the British working class, struggling for their rights. He settled in Leningrad where he joined the Anglo-American section of the International Seamen's Club. His job here was to indoctrinate Western crew members on shore leave into the virtues of Communism. During the Second World War he survived through the nearly 900 days Siege of Leningrad, but shortly after the war his luck ran out. In 1946, he was accused of being a British spy and duly arrested by the NKVD. After a show trial he was sentenced to a long term in the Gulag. At one time he was in the same labour camp as Victor Louis.All Them Cornfields and Ballet in the Evenings p. 131. After spending nearly eleven years in labour camps he was only rehabilitated during the onset of Nikita Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation campaign in 1956. After his release, he became a friend of Donald Maclean and contributed articles for the Anglo-Soviet Friendship Society magazine.All Them Cornfields and Ballet in the Evenings p. 131. Apart from a visit to England in 1974 Wincott spent the rest of his life in the Soviet Union. He met and married his fourth wife in the Gulag and he died in Moscow in January 1983. According to his last wishes, his ashes were scattered over Devonport Harbour.

It was first published in 2001.  Plot summary  John is a fourteen-year-old boy. He lives with his mother and his mother's boyfriend, Stan, who he calls the \\"Man Who is Not my Father\\". His real father left the home when John was young. Stan abuses John by assaulting him when nobody is around. As well as his family life, much of the book explores John's struggles to fit in at school and his relationship with his closest friend, whom John calls \\"Billy Beezer\\" because of his long nose. John is presented as a social outsider, his one interest being playing the tuba, which he was forced into when asked to choose an extra-curricular activity, but he has a crush on a very popular girl named Gloria, whom he calls \\"Glory Hallelujah\\". Billy also has a crush on Gloria. Billy Beezer is arrested for stealing an egg roll from a Chinese restaurant in the food court of a mall. With Billy out of the picture, John sees this as an opportunity to ask Gloria out, which he does the following day. She accepts and goes to a basketball game with him. Billy also attends the game and calls John a terrible friend. A riot breaks out in the gym and John and Gloria escape. Gloria brings John home and seduces him until John escapes from her and her angry father, but leaves clothes and money which he took from his stepfather Stan's bedroom drawer. Stan finds out and takes John to do some \\"business\\" as a way of paying back the money. John is forced to carry TVs into a truck and realises that Stan is handling stolen goods, which is how he affords the brand-new TV in their home despite not working. Stan tells John that he and John's mother are getting married. In school, Gloria humiliates John, Billy picks on him and he is in trouble for vocalizing a rude thought about a teacher out loud and making her cry. Soon John is asked to a dance by a girl in the school orchestra named Violet, who he had previously nicknamed \\"Violent\\" because of her bad saxophone playing. He goes with her, then home to her house, where her parents are much kinder than Gloria's. Violet stands up for John against Gloria and her new jock boyfriend. When John goes home, Stan is drunk and assaults John, but this time he fights back. Stan gets the better of the fight and beats John senseless. He is saved by his music teacher, Mr. Steenwilly, who had suspected John was being emotionally abused due to his negative attitude in orchestra, and came to check up on him. John wakes up in hospital surrounded by his friends and mother. His mother wishes he had told her about Stan's abusive behaviour before, and says that she loves him. John finally feels that his mother really knows him, because she decides to leave Stan. John attends the orchestra's end-of-year concert as a spectator (Stan punched him in the mouth, leaving him unable to play the tuba), where he cries at the end of a piece of music, because he finally figures out that it is a love story. Violet plays well during the piece and it is suggested that John is in love with her. Reception The New York Times said the book was a mixture between Stephen King's novel Misery and The Catcher in the Ryes main character Holden Caulfield. On the other hand, the Lodi News-Sentinel hoped that abused youth would be persuaded to look for help after reading this book. The Washington Post said overall You Don't Know Me was \\" a fast-paced, completely readable book\\".

It is named after the thousands of Serbs who were deported from the city of Belgrade in 1521 when it fell to the Ottomans. Geographically, the forest is located at the easternmost point of the Thracian Peninsula. Forest terrain is divided between Sarƒ±yer and Ey√ºp districts. Several historical reservoirs lie within the forest. History It was named after the thousands of Serbs that Suleiman the Magnificent transferred to Istanbul after the 1521 Siege of Belgrade. The migrants brought with them the relics of Parascheva of the Balkans. The forest still carries the Bulgarian etymology of Belgrade, since the name of the city in Bulgarian is ‚Ä≥–ë–µ–ª–≥—Ä–∞–¥/Belgrad‚Ä≥. Size and composition of the forest The marsh in the middle of the Belgrad Forest, Istanbul, Turkey. With a region around 5,500 hectares of forest it houses many plant, bird and animal species. The most common tree in the forest is sessile oak (Quercus petraea). Belgrad Forest is under protection and is one of the most visited recreational areas of Istanbul. The building of the western section of the motorway running over the 3rd Bosphorus bridge (opened 2016) which runs through the northern part of the forest, the expansion of Istanbul (Maslak etc. ), the settlements which surround the forest, and new roads question the practical effect of the protection.My Merhaba \\"Belgrade Forest\\" October 1, 2006 Aqueducts One of the many pathways in the forest, a favorite among Istanbulites for jogging and running. New Dam at the Bentler Nature Park inside the Belgrad Forest. Instead of finding many Byzantine remains of aqueducts, there are mainly only Ottoman dams remaining, which were all built over a period of 150 years. The Valens Aqueduct that straddles busy Atat√ºrk Bulvarƒ± as it runs uphill from the Golden Horn is the largest of the monuments commemorating the complex system needed to bring the water into the city during the 16th-18th centuries. In the forest there were two separate channeling systems. The older of the two was the Kƒ±rk√ße≈üme system that directed water into town Eƒürikapƒ± hard against the city walls. Many of the aqueducts and reservoirs that supported this system were originally built in Roman and Byzantine times, but in the 16th century Suleiman the Magnificent commissioned the Ottoman architect Sinan to upgrade it all for the new aqueduct system that would lead into his city. The result was a series of magnificent aqueducts that criss-cross the roads near Kemerburgaz. The Ma«ßlova Aqueduct is the largest, with its exceptional architecture, strength and structure, and with a little effort is accessible to the public from both ends and can be safely walked through on its lower level. The Kemerburgaz aqueduct can be similarly traversed. The newly restored Uzunkemer still stands right across a busy road in the forest (not traversable). As the population of ƒ∞stanbul grew, the water supply system also had to be expanded to cope with the increasing numbers of people living in the city, which resulted in a second supply line; the Taksim system. Most of its aqueducts and reservoirs were built in the 18th century well after the reconstruction that took place earlier in the 16th century. The most noticeable monument is the Mahmud I Kemer, erected in 1732, that stands right beside the road in Bah√ßek√∂y. The Taksim system ended at the large reservoir in Taksim Square that now acts as a small art gallery used for tourism.Pat Yale \\"Istanbul: Belgrade Forest\\" October 1, 2006 Crime In 2018, Turkish police stated that Jamal Khashoggi was murdered and dumped in this forest.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/18/search-for-khashoggis- remains-extends-to-saudi-consul-generals- residencehttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45909732 He had gone to visit the Saudi consulate in Istanbul but there was no CCTV of him walking away from the consulate. Recreation and tourism It is common to find historic ruins scattered around the forest, such as this church of St. George. Walking, Jogging & Hiking: One of the most popular activities to do in the Belgrad Forest besides looking at the beautiful trees and enjoying nature is the fact that you can easily jog and hike through the trails. There is a jogging track that begins at a fountain by the Neset Suyu (Neset Spring) and weaves a 6 ¬Ω km route with exercise equipment stationed along the way for public use, and the Istanbul Hash House Harriers often runs through this trail. There are many paths and tracks running through the Forest outside of the main recreational areas and a walker can pass hours in the Forest rarely meeting anyone else. The main complication is that there is no available map (satellite maps are useful for showing roads and the wider tracks but not for showing paths and fences) showing the paths and tracks - they have to be discovered. There are also some fenced-off areas and roads running through the Forest which can make finding a good walking route trickier. If going deeper into the Forest, a compass is recommended. A GPS device such as a smartphone is also very useful. The Forest is only mildly hilly and in many places can be walked through even where there is no path or track. The easiest place to start exploring the Forest is the small town of Bah√ßek√∂y which is almost in the middle of the Forest. Bah√ßek√∂y is well served by public buses. Most of the Ottoman dams and reservoirs are easily reachable from Bah√ßek√∂y. Atat√ºrk Arboretum: To see the forest‚Äôs foliage during the changing seasons, the best place to visit is the arboretum in the area, which is open during weekdays. In the facility, there is more than 2,000 plant species. The main attraction in the gardens is in the autumn when the collection of oak trees from all around the world can be viewed. As of 2016 the Arboretum is open every day except Mondays and entry is 5TL for students and 15TL for everyone else. The entrance is about a 20 minutes walk from the centre of Bah√ßek√∂y. A visit can easily take a couple of hours. Food (not water) is confiscated at the entrance but returned on leaving.Arboretum: Faculty of Forestry Eating & Drinking: One of the most common things for locals and travelers to do in Istanbul is to take a trip to the Belgrad Forest on the weekend to escape from the heat in the spring and summer months. There are areas specifically for recreation and travelers are even allowed to use portable barbecues to enjoy with friends and family. There are seven main picnic areas in the Forest; the most popular destination is B√ºy√ºk Bent. This area has its own cafe where you are able to bring your own food and cook on the long wooden tables; drinks and snacks are sold on-site.English.Istanbul.gov.tr If you are planning on cooking your own BBQ, it is suggested that you pay attention and use caution as firefighting facilities are not well prepared to deal with forest fires in the area.My Merhaba October 1, 2006 There are also a few other cafes scattered around the forest, making the area metropolis in some areas, however, most of the areas in the forest consist of wildlife. =Nature parks= There are nine nature parks in the Belgrad Forest: References See also * Bulgaria (theme) * Great Bulgarian Forest Category:Forests of Turkey Category:Sarƒ±yer Category:Ey√ºp Category:Tourist attractions in Istanbul Category:Geography of Istanbul Province ","title":"Belgrad Forest"},{"id":"32047679","text":"Andrew Phillips (born 27 January 1970) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Carlton Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).

It is native to an area stretching from North Carolina west to Texas in the United States and south to Nuevo Le√≥n and Tamaulipas in Mexico. Description False aloe is acaulescent, meaning the stem is extremely short. Leaves and flowering stems are from a bulbous herbaceous caudex. The fleshy green leaves are usually spotted or speckled with maroon. Sufficient precipitation yields an inflorescence up to tall in the period from early summer to late summer, rarely in the spring. The inflorescences bears 10‚Äì61 closely spaced flowers. Flowers are sessile or pedicellate, nearly erect, slender, with a fragrant sweet fruity odor. Seed capsules are globose and 1‚Äì1.7 cm diameter. Leaf shape and size in Agave virginica vary with soil type, amount of shade, length of cold period, and position of leaf in the rosette. Speckles and spots occur frequently on some leaves in most populations, and some authors have used the informal designation \\"forma tigrina\\" for such variants. Ecology Agave virginica is adapted primarily to nocturnal pollination by medium-sized moths and larger sphinx moths. Diurnal pollination by large bees results in significantly less seed set than nocturnal and open pollination. Hummingbirds are also attracted to the blooms.

It was part of the Allied Spring Offensive of the same year that was designed to break the stalemate on the Macedonian Front. Despite the considerable numerical and mat√©riel advantage of the attackers over the defenders, the Bulgarian and German defense of the positions in the loop of the river Crna remained a very formidable obstacle, which the Allies were unable to defeat not only in 1917 but until the end of the war itself. Background Military operations on the Macedonian Front in 1916 With the onset of the winter of 1916 all military operations on the Macedonian Front came to an abrupt end. The three-month-long Monastir Offensive provided the Allies with only limited tactical successes but it failed to knockout Bulgaria out of the war by a combined attack of General Sarrail's forces and the Romanian Army.–ö–æ—Ä—Å—É–Ω (1939). –ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç.–ò—Ç–æ–≥–∏ –∫–∞–º–ø–∞–Ω–∏–∏ 1916 –≥. –í–æ–µ–Ω–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç –ù–ö–û –°–°–°–†. On strategic level the overall result of the offensive was that it managed to keep over half of the Bulgarian Army and few German units on the Macedonian Front. On tactical level the front line was moved in favor of the Allies by only about 50 kilometers in the Sector of General Winkler's 11th German-Bulgarian Army. By the end of November however the Bulgarians and Germans were able to firmly establish themselves on the Chervena Stena ‚Äì height 1248 ‚Äì Hill 1050 ‚Äì Dabica ‚Äì Grade≈°nica defensive line and subsequently repel all Allied attempts to dislodge them of their positions.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg.3 This brought about the stabilization of the entire front line and forced the Allies to call off the offensive altogether. The opposing sides were now free to regroup their exhausted forces and fortify their lines. The strategic situation in the early spring of 1917 on all European theaters of war, except the Romanian portion of the Eastern Front, favored the implementation of the Allied offensive plans that were adopted during the inter-allied conference of November 1916 held in Chantilly, France. These plans included an offensive on the Macedonian Front designed to support main the Allied efforts on the other fronts and if possible completely defeat Bulgaria with the assistance of Russian and Romanian forces.–ö–æ—Ä—Å—É–Ω (1939). –ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç.–ü–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –°–∞–ª–æ–Ω–∏–∫—Å–∫–æ–º —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç–µ –≤ 1917 –≥. –ü–ª–∞–Ω—ã —Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–Ω –Ω–∞ 1917 –≥. –í–æ–µ–Ω–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç –ù–ö–û –°–°–°–†. The Bulgarians on their part asked the Germans to join an offensive against Salonika with six divisions but the German High Command refused and forced the adoption of a purely defensive stance of the Central Powers forces on the Balkan Front. Preparations =Allied plan= The commander of the Allied armies on the Salonika Front General Sarrail commenced preparations for the offensive as soon as he received his orders. By early spring 1917 he produced a general plan that envisaged a main attack delivered in the Serbian sector by the Serbian 2nd Army and at least two other secondary attacks ‚Äì the first by the British to the east of the Vardar and the second by the Italians and French in the Crna Bend.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg.8–î–∞–Ω–∏–ª–æ–≤(1933), pg.176 French and Greek forces to the west of the Vardar were also to undertake aggressive action. The commander of the French Army of the East General Paul Grossetti informed his superior that his forces would need at least 40 days to prepare for the operations which forced General Sarrail to set the start of the offensive for the 12 of April 1917.–î–∞–Ω–∏–ª–æ–≤(1933), pg.176 The bad weather conditions however soon forced him to change the starting date several times until it was determined that the British main attack should commence on 24 of April and the rest on 30 of April. In accordance the British began the 2nd Battle of Doiran according to schedule but were soon forced to call off their attacks as it became clear that the rest of the Allies were not able to deliver their attacks on time. The dates for the attacks were finally set for the 5 of May in the Crna Bend and 8 of May in the Serbian and British sectors.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg.9 In the Crna Bend sector the planned attack was assigned to the left right of the French Army of the East ‚Äì the so-called First Group of Divisions(under the command of General Georges Lebouc) and to the Italian Expeditionary Force. Its primary task was to penetrate all Bulgarian and German lines in the direction of the town of Prilep and thus threaten the rear of the Bulgarian forces around the Vardar and Monastir. General Sarrail had surveyed the area and determined that the Italians and French should deliver a frontal assault against almost the entire length of the defensive line which caused serious doubt about the final success of the operation among the Italian and French commanders.Villari (1922), pg.130 In order to strengthen the Allies Sarrail also attached a Russian infantry brigade to the Crna sector forces a few days before the attack.–î–∞–Ω–∏–ª–æ–≤(1933), pg.177 =Central Powers plan= The Bulgarians and Germans were well aware of the impending Allied offensive and decided to rely on the strength of their well prepared fortifications, strong artillery and machine gun fire while also placing as many troops as possible in the first lines and preparing sufficient reserves in case the Allies achieved a breakthrough and the need for strong counter-attacks arose.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg.9 The task of the defenders was to preserve their positions at all costs and protect the important lines of communication running along the Gradsko-Prilep road.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg.29 On February 12, the Germans had already launched a successful attack on Italian forces west of Hill 1050 using flamethrowers.

In 1917 the Central Powers forces in the area were part of the 62nd Corps of the 11th German-Bulgarian Army, both of which were commanded by German generals and staff. The first-line units assigned to the sector, along a 23 kilometer front, were the 302nd Division and the 22nd German-Bulgarian Brigade. These forces occupied a generally well fortified line which was especially strong in the points that were considered crucial for the defense such as Hill 1050, Hill 1060, Dabica etc. In such places the defense consisted of complicated networks of trenches protected by several lines of barbed wire that were each usually 3‚Äì5 meters thick but in some places reached a thickness of 10‚Äì15 meters. In addition there were good infantry shelters that were connected to each other by communication trenches. The troops were well supplied with ammunition and their morale was high.

Due to the calm and warm weather the entire defensive line was soon engulfed in a cloud of smoke and dust. The barrage lasted for the entire day and had mixed effects, depending on the ground and strength of the fortifications it was directed at. This was the case in the sector of the 302nd Division where the Bulgarian 2/2nd Infantry Brigade was defending lines situated in a flat plain and the shelters were not enough for all the soldiers. By contrast the bombardment hardly made an impression on the German 201st Infantry Brigade which occupied the important hills 1020 and 1050.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg50 Its infantry benefited from the rugged terrain and the excellent shelters, that were in some cases dug in the solid rock. The Allied artillery fire in the sector of the Bulgarian 3/7 Infantry Brigade caused serious damage on part of the barbed wire and collapsed several infantry shelters. Von Reuter's troops were also exposed to the heavy bombardment and had some of their first-line trenches and barbed wire severely damaged. The Allied artillery on this part of the front was forced to pause its barrage for some time in the afternoon due to the appearance of German fighter aircraft and the destruction of one of their observation balloons.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg53 With the coming of the night the Allied fire was significantly reduced in intensity which gave a chance to the defenders to repair part of the inflicted damage. At 6:00 On 6 of May the Allied artillery renewed its bombardment and continued in the same manner as the day before throughout the entire day. This time however the Italians, French and Russians also sent patrols to check the effect of the bombardment on the Bulgarian- German lines and test the strength of the fortifications. The Bulgarians and Germans managed to hold off their attempts to close on the lines by strong infantry and artillery fire. On this day the Central Powers artillery took a more active part in the battle and often engaged in counter-infantry and counter-battery work with the help of German reconnaissance planes.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg58-60 By the end of the day the Allied artillery once again reduced the intensity of its fire. In the morning on 7 of May the Allies renewed their bombardment once again. On this day the barrage was even more powerful than the previous days and the Italian and French guns fired more than 15,000 shells on the lines of the Bulgarian 2/2nd Infantry Brigade alone.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg58-60 Stronger reconnaissance patrols were dispatched but were once again held of by the Bulgarians and Germans, who answered with sending their own patrols to determine weather the Allies were preparing for a major infantry attack. The results of the three-day artillery barrage proved unsatisfactory and General Grossetti decided that it should be continued on the 8 of May with the help of four observation balloons. The day for the main infantry attack was finally set for the 9 of May. Overall the results of the four-day preliminary artillery bombardment proved unsatisfactory. The Allied fire did not cause severe damage to the Bulgarian and German defensive line while the greater focus of the artillery fire on some points of the line gave a clear indication of the directions where the main attack was to be delivered.Villari (1922), pg.130 The defenders also used every possible moment to repair the damage to their fortifications under the cover of their own artillery. The Bulgarian and German artillery and its observations posts were practically untouched by the Allied bombardment.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pp 101 While the Bulgarian infantry units suffered 945 casualties during the four day of bombardment, the losses of the artillery were only 10 men killed or wounded and several guns damaged or destroyed.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pp 128‚Äì129 =Infantry assault= The beginning of the infantry attack was set by the Allied command for 6:30 on 9 of May and as the infantry prepared the artillery resumed its barrage with much greater vigor, once again engulfing the entire defensive line in a cloud of smoke and dust.Villari (1922), pg.130–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 71–î–∞–Ω–∏–ª–æ–≤(1933), pg.178 At precisely 6:30 the Italian, French and Russian infantry moved out of their trenches and advanced against the Bulgarian and German positions along an 11-kilometer long line. The assault of the 35th Division The 35th Italian Infantry Division attacked the Bulgarian 2/2 Infantry Brigade and German 201st Infantry Brigade with its Sicilia and Ivrea infantry brigades(61st, 62nd, 161st and 162nd infantry regiments).Villari (1922), pg.130–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 73 The focal points of the assault were the powerful positions on Hill 1020 and Hill 1050. To the right parts of the 61st regiment took advantage of the dust cloud, left by the barrage, and managed to capture a forward trench that the Bulgarians had evacuated in order to preserve their infantry from the Allied artillery fire. The Bulgarian infantry responded soon after with a counter-attack that pushed back the Italians and recaptured the trench. Meanwhile, further to the right of these events the troops of the Italian 61st Regiment advanced against the Bulgarian I/9 infantry battalion but were repulsed by artillery fire. The 1st and 3rd battalions of this regiment however had greater success and managed to take control the first-line trench of the 9th German J√§ger Battalion, between Hill 1020 and Hill 1050.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 73 The Italian soldiers continued advancing towards the second-line of trenches and succeeded in entering it because most of the defenders were still in the trenches and galleries on the northern slopes of hills 1020 and 1050. Soon after the Bulgarian and German rifle, machine gun and artillery fire intensified and caused heavy casualties to the attackers as it hit the Italians not only from their front but also from their flanks.Villari (1922), pg.131 The commander of the 3rd Battalion Major Tonti was killed. At 7:40 the commander of the J√§gers requested reinforcements from the neighboring Bulgarian units and counter-attacked as soon as they arrived. The Germans and Bulgarians quickly regained control of their lost trenches(capturing 120 prisoners in the process), forcing the Italian 61st Regiment to fall back to its starting positions.Villari (1922), pg.131–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 74 In the center of the Italian front of attack the 161st Infantry Regiment was tasked with taking Hill 1050 but its advance met with a strong barrage delivered by the Bulgarian artillery. Still parts of the left flank and center of the regiment reached the first trenches while another detachment succeeded in getting round the hill from the east.Villari (1922), pg.131–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 74 While they advanced these troops were also subjected to very heavy artillery, trench-mortar and machine-gun fire which was the prelude for a counter-attack delivered by the German Guard Jaegers that saw the entire Italian regiment thrown back to its original positions. During the Italian attack and German counter-attack the 161st Regiment suffered very heavy losses. One of its infantry companies was almost completely destroyed by the explosion of a mine that was laid in the trenches by the defenders.Villari (1922), pg.131–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 74 On the right of the Italian front the attacking 162nd Italian regiment suffered much the same fate as the other attacking forces. It attacked a hill defended by troops of the German 45th Infantry Regiment and initially succeeded in overcoming the barbed wire and occupying part of the first line of trenches.Villari (1922), pg.131–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 74 To their right however the 16th French Colonial Division failed to permanently capture an important hill Piton Rocheaux which left the Italian flank unsupported and vulnerable. As result the Italians were met by a very heavy artillery, machine-gun and hand-grenade fire from behind, and by machine-gun fire coming from their right flank.Villari (1922), pg.131 This obliged them to fall back to their own starting trenches. By this time the total losses of the Ivrea Brigade(161st and 162nd regiments) were 40 officers and around 1000 soldiers.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 74 Thus the first assault on the Bulgarian and German positions ended in almost complete failure. General Pennella ordered the attack to be resumed with the help of the divisional artillery. At 9:45 the Italian infantrymen once again moved forward but as conditions hadn't improved in their favor, they achieved no better success and once again suffered heavy losses.Villari (1922), pg.132 By midday the attack had died off and General Pennella postponed it. By the end of the day the Italians had lost between 2,400–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 88 and 2700Villari (1922), pg.132 men, which amounted to about 21% of the committed infantry. One Italian observation balloon was also lost. During the infantry attack on 9 of May the Allied artillery in the Italian sector fired 31,235 shells against the defenders. The assault in the French sector Bulgarian soldier firing his rifle from a trench The 16th French Colonial Infantry Division, which was neighboring the Italian 35th Division to its east, was ordered to attack with its 12 battalions the positions of the Bulgarian 3/7 Infantry Brigade and parts of the German 201st Infantry Brigade (6 Bulgarian and German battalions in total).–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 75 The artillery preparation for the attack began at 4:30 and peaked in intensity about an hour later. The Allied bombardment destroyed many of the Bulgarian forward infantry observation posts, caused damage to the fortifications and covered the three hills, that were the objectives of the attack, in a dense cloud of smoke and dust. At 6:30 the French infantry advanced with three regiments in the first line and one regiment in reserve. On the right the 8th Colonial Infantry Regiment assaulted the hill \\"Dalag Greben\\"(its French designation was Piton Rocheaux) and infiltrated the trenches defended by two battalion of the German 201st Infantry Brigade. Following a costly hand-to-hand engagement however the French were driven out which left the flank of the attacking Italians to the left of these positions exposed and contributed to their defeat.Villari (1922), pg.131–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 76 In the center the 4th Colonial Regiment moved against the hill named by the Bulgarians \\"Shtabna Visochina\\"(its French designation was Piton Jaune)and managed to advance without initially being spotted as many of the Bulgarian observes had been killed or wounded.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 76 The few that had survived the French bombardment however were able to fire their red flairs and signal the defenders as the attackers reached the barbed wire lines. Almost immediately the Bulgarian infantry came out from its shelters or hide-outs into the trenches and opened heavy rifle and machine gun fire on the French. This caught the first wave of attackers by surprise and forced to retreat which in turn caused the next two waves of French infantry to waver and eventually withdraw. While they were retreating the French came under Bulgarian artillery fire and suffered heavy casualties. To the right the French 37th Colonial Regiment had better luck and managed to enter and occupy the trenches on Hill \\"Vaskova Visochina\\"(Tranchees rouges) undetected where they placed in position several machine guns. The reason for this was that nearby Bulgarian infantry was still mostly in its shelters. A general alert was sounded when an observer from a nearby Bulgarian company spotted the French. The troops of the Bulgarian battalion, that was responsible for the defense of the hill, immediately came out of their shelters and counter-attacked under a hail of rifle and machine gun bullets. With the help of some Bulgarian machin guns who were firing at the exposed French flank the Bulgarians managed to reach and enter the trenches where a difficult hand-to-hand combat ensued. Many Bulgarian officers were killed, including the battalion commander captain Vaskov.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 77 The counter-attack also began drawing in the battalions reserves, positioned some 600 meters to the north, that attempted to advance against the French flanks. On the left the Bulgarians managed to enter the trenches occupied by the French and neutralize or capture some of their machine guns. As more Bulgarian infantry and German machine guns became involved in the counter-attack the soldiers of the 37th Colonial Regiment were finally forced to abandon the hill and retreat. By 8:00 the attack of the 16th Colonial Division was beaten along the entire defensive line. Thus at 9:00 the division reinforced its attacking units and began a second attack against the hills \\"Shtabna Visochina\\" and \\"Vaskova Visochina\\" which was once again defeated. The losses of the Bulgarian 3/7 Infantry Brigade for the day were 134 killed and 276 wounded. The brigade captured 44 French troops in a half-drunken state and reported that its soldiers had counted 725 killed French soldiers.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 79 A few days following the attack General Sarrail reported a total of around 1,000 casualties in the 16th Colonial division for the attack on 9 of May. Further to the east of the 16th Colonial Division was the French 17th Colonial Division. On 9 of May this division was tasked with attacking the positions of the 22nd German-Bulgarian Infantry Brigade in conjunction with the Russian 2nd Independent Infantry Brigade. The artillery preparation in this sector began at 5:15 in the morning(guided by and observation balloon) and reached peak intensity at about 6:00 when it covered most of the German and Bulgarian lines. At precisely 6:30 the barrage lifted from the first line of trenches and moved on to their rear. At this moment the French infantry advanced in three waves with three regiments in the first line and one in reserve. Halfway across no man's land the attackers were spotted by Bulgarian artillery men and subjected to heavy artillery shelling.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pp 80‚Äì83 While one part of the attacking French soldiers were killed, wounded or seeking cover another part successfully reached and entered the first line of Bulgarian and German trenches. There they engaged the defenders in hand-to-hand combat but were defeated and pushed back. The French failed to take the important position named \\"Caesar\\" which gave a tactical advantage to the defenders who could concentrate their efforts on deflecting the Russian attack. At 8:45 the first French assault was decisively beaten. At 11:00 the French infantry attempted another attack but only 15 minutes later were forced to withdraw to their starting positions. The soldiers that were captured by the Bulgarians were found to be half-drunk and their canteens filled with wine or liqueur. A third French attack was carried out in the afternoon but was once again beaten back by 18:00. The total casualties suffered by the 17th Colonial Division during the day were about 700 men. Assault of the Russian 2nd Independent Infantry Brigade Out of the 18 battalions detailed for the attacked on the positions of the 22nd German-Bulgarian Infantry Brigade 6 belonged to the Russian 2nd Independent Infantry Brigade of General Dietrichs. This brigade was added to the Franco-Italian group in the Crna Bend a short time before the beginning of the Allied offensive.–î–∞–Ω–∏–ª–æ–≤(1933), pg.177 It occupied part of the front situated between the French 16th and 17th colonial divisions. On 9 of May the Russian infantry began its attack on the German and Bulgarian lines at 6:30, in close cooperation with the neighboring 17th Colonial Division. On the right flank of the brigade the 3rd Infantry Regiment advanced against the \\"Heintselman\\" hill which was occupied a battalion of the German 42nd Infantry Regiment while at the same time on the left flank the 4th Infantry Regiment attacked the important Hill \\"Dabica\\" which was defended by another battalion of the German 42nd Infantry Regiment. As soon as the Russians were spotted the German and Bulgarian artillery opened fire on their advancing waves of infantry which allowed only parts of the Russian 3rd Regiment to enter the \\"Heitselman\\" trenches while most of its soldiers had sought cover next to the barbed wire before the hill itself. At Dabica however the German artillery proved too weak to halt the attack of the Russian 4th Infantry Regiment, whose troops successfully penetrated into the main trench with the help of hand grenades and advanced so rapidly through it that by 8:00 the entire hill fell under their control.–î–∞–Ω–∏–ª–æ–≤(1933), pg.178–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 82 As result the headquarters of the 22nd German-Bulgarian lost connection with its troops in the area and received no clear information about the situation until late in the afternoon. While many of the German defenders managed to retreat from the hill and gathered around by the Bulgarian reserve, the Russians also took 4 German officers and 74 German soldiers from the II/42 German battalion as prisoners.–î–∞–Ω–∏–ª–æ–≤(1933), pg.178–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 82 The capture of Dabica was the greatest and most important Allied achievement of the battle. Unfortunately for the Russians this success was not expanded because the attack of the French against the \\"Caesar\\" position failed which allowed the Germans and Bulgarians to clear \\"Heintselman\\" of Russian presence. Thus by 8:45 most of the first major Allied attack was completely repelled leaving only Dabica in Russian hands.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 82 The situation of the 4th Regiment remained serious because the Bulgarians and Germans were encircling it from three sides. At 14:40 the commander of the Franco-Russian forces General Lebouc ordered the Russian Brigade to attack and capture \\"Heintselman\\" with its 3rd Regiment while the 17th Colonial Division carried out a new assault against \\"Caesar\\".–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 84 The attack, which was scheduled for 17:30, was preceded by a very short but powerful artillery barrage which caused damaged to the defensive line. Still once the attacking Russian and French infantry moved out of its trenches and reached the Bulgarian barbed wire it was hit by a very powerful artillery bombardment, coming from the nearby Bulgarian and German batteries, which caused great confusion among its ranks.–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 85 Thus three consecutive waves of attacking infantry were driven back to their starting trenches and the Russian infantry which managed to get to \\"Heintselman\\" was decisively repelled by its German defenders. By 18:00 the attack was called off all together. Despite this setback the Russians continued to hold their positions on \\"Dabitsa\\" but the initiative was now in German and Bulgarian hands. The commander of the 22nd Infantry Brigade colonel von Reuter planned to retake his lost positions by attacking from both the west and east sides of \\"Dabica\\". The artillery preparation for the attack began at 19:40 and delivered a devastating bombardment on the Russian positions.–î–∞–Ω–∏–ª–æ–≤(1933), pg.178–î–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤(1935), pg 86 Under its cover at 19:55 the infantry counter-attack began with the German J√§gers attacking from the west and the Bulgarians attacking from the east. The Russian positions proved untenable and by 20:10 the Germans and Bulgarians linked up on top of the hill. With the recapture of \\"Dabica\\" the integrity of the entire defensive line in the Crna Bend sector was restored and the battle on 9 of May ended in decisive victory for the Central Powers. Russian casualties were heavy and ranged from 975–î–∞–Ω–∏–ª–æ–≤(1933), pg.179 to 1325 men killed or wounded. Aftermath During the decisive Allied infantry assault the Bulgarians suffered 681 men killed or wounded, most of them in the 302nd division, which brought their total losses to 1,626 men for the period from 5 to 9 of May 1917. German losses during the attack are unknown but it is likely that they were heavy because the German units were usually caught in the thick of the fighting. The Allies on the other hand had sustained some 5,450 casualties during the attack on 9 of May for no gain at all. Despite the failure Generail Sarrail was not ready to give up on his offensive and new attacks were made by the Italians and French in the Crna Bend on 11 and 17 of May which ended in failure. Finally following the French defeat around Monastir and the British defeat at Lake Doiran General Sarrail called off the entire offensive on 21 of May.

The song mocks the stereotype of Berliners as unrestrictedly revelrous. According to music professor Lukas Richter the song is of the Schwank type common in German-speaking countries. (compare to Oh du lieber Augustin).Lukas Richter (Hrsg.): Mutter, der Mann mit dem Koks ist da. Berliner Gassenhauer ‚Äì mit Noten. Leipzig: Dt. Verl. f√ºr Musik 1977 The song makes references to Pankow which was a suburb in the middle of the 19th century. At that time it was a common conduct to board a Kremser van - the Berlin variant of a charabanc - to drive out of town to one of the inns, in the case of this song one of the many around the Sch√∂nholzer Heide park that were a popular destination for day- trippers. The name Bolle (meaning \\"onion\\" in Berlin dialect) refers to an indeterminate person, and there is no evidence that it refers to the Berlin merchant Carl Bolle or Fritze Bollmann. As common for a folk song there are a number of recordings available which show variants in wording as well as the number of verses.

It was also known as Palazzo di Raffaello, or Raphael's House, since the artist had bought it in 1517 and lived there until his death three years later,Gigli (1992) p. 46 although by then he was planning a much larger new palazzo elsewhere.

The upper floor had windows divided by double Doric columns, surmounted by a complete entablature. It was highly influential, providing a standard model for the integration of the rusticated ground floor with arched openings, characteristic of 15th-century Florentine palaces alla antica such as the Pitti Palace, with the classical orders. The decorative inclusion of large rusticated voussoirs and keystone instead of a lintel over the flat top of the lower rectangular openings in the end shop fronts was also a device with a long future. The apparent strength of a blind arched arcade with emphatic voussoirs on the rusticated ground storey gave reassuring support to the upper storey's paired Doric columns standing on rusticated piers, set against a smooth wall. The many buildings providing variations of the design include Somerset House in London.Summerson, 52-53 Notes Sources  *Summerson, John, The Classical Language of Architecture, 1980 edition, Thames and Hudson World of Art series, *[4] Herman Grimm, Leben Michelangelo's Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1510 Category:Houses completed in the 16th century Category:Renaissance architecture in Rome Caprini Category:Donato Bramante buildings Caprini Category:1510 establishments in the Papal States ","title":"Palazzo Caprini"},{"id":"32047792","text":"Andrew McKinnon (born 28 July 1968) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Carlton Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).

The species is known only to inhabit the coastal waters of China, primarily in estuarine tidal flats. The Chinese sillago was described in 2011 based on morphological and DNA barcode analysis of several specimens. Several detailed anatomic features distinguish it from other sillaginids, with Sillago parvisquamis its closest relative based on phylogenetic analysis. Nothing is known of the ecology or importance to fisheries of the Chinese sillago. Taxonomy and phylogeny The Chinese sillago is one of 31 currently recognised species in the genus Sillago, itself one of 3 genera of smelt whiting in the family Sillaginidae. The Sillaginidae are percoid fishes in the order Perciformes. The Chinese sillago was first described by a group of 6 authors in 2011 based on several type specimens collected from various parts of the East China Sea. The designated holotype is from near Wenzhou in the Zhejiang Province. The species specific epithet arises from the Latin word for China. The authors used the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene as a DNA barcode to further justify the assignment of a new species of Sillago. In doing so they also analysed the species position relative to several sillaginids with an overlapping geographic distribution. The results clearly indicated S. sinica was sufficiently genetically distant from other species to be considered a new species. S. parvisquamis is the closest species genetically which correlates with the similar overall morphology of these two species. The authors also demonstrated that the COI gene is a viable method of phylogenetically analysing the Sillaginide. Description The Chinese sillago is similar in external appearance to many other members of the genus Sillago, which have a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first made of feeble spines and the second of soft rays headed by a single feeble spine. The first dorsal fin has either 10 or 11 dorsal spines, a feature unique among Sillago which otherwise have 11 dorsal spines. The second dorsal fin has a single spine followed by 20-22 soft rays, while the anal fin has 2 spines and 21 to 23 soft rays. There are 37 to 39 vertebrae, while the otolith morphology is also distinctive. The body is covered in small ctenoid scales, with the anterior scales larger than the posterior. The pectoral and ventral fin bases both lack scales. The maximum known size of the species is 17.5 cm. The Chinese sillago grades from a yellowish brown above to a silvery grey on its underside. A weak lateral stripe may be present. The dorsal fins are yellow to hyaline with small dark spots on the first dorsal fin and 3 to 4 rows of dusky spots on the membranes. The remaining fins are yellowish, with the caudal fin becoming dusky and having dark margins. Distribution and biology The Chinese sillago is only known from one study which collected all material from the East China Sea, Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea within China. The species is presumed to inhabit tidal flats in estuarine areas. Other areas of the species biology and ecology are unknown, with further study required. The relative importance to fisheries is also unknown, although sillaginids in general are of importance in Chinese waters.

The series of twelve novels by Dennis Wheatley covers events from a dozen years before the French Revolution to the fall of Napoleon. Historically accurate, the series is written from the perspective of an aide-de-camp to Napoleon himself. The Roger Brook books were written after Wheatley had been a member of Winston Churchill's Joint Planning Staff during World War II. During that period, Wheatley had accumulated much distinctive knowledge on matters relevant to the war and politics, but he was not allowed to use this knowledge in his novels because of the Official Secrets Act. He discussed the subject with Air Commodore Kenneth Collier, who came up with a suggestion about placing Wheatley's stories in the Napoleonic times instead. Wheatley combined his habit of doing extensive research, in this case to gather accurate historical details about the Napoleonic era, with his wartime knowledge and experience. After completing the final book in the series, Desperate Measures (1974), Wheatley decided to retire from writing fiction.Dennis Yates Wheatley - Gale The twelve books, with the dates when first published, and the period covered by the plot of each book, are as follows: * The Launching of Roger Brook (3 July 1947) covers 28 July 1783 - November 1787 * The Shadow of Tyburn Tree (6 May 1948) March 1788 - April 1789 * The Rising Storm (13 October 1949) April 1789 - July 1790 * The Man Who Killed the King (8 November 1951) June 1792 - August 1794 * The Dark Secret of Josephine (16 March 1955) August 1794 - April 1796 * The Rape of Venice (19 October 1959) June 1796 - December 1797 * The Sultan's Daughter (19 August 1963) February 1798 - 31 December 1799 * The Wanton Princess (22 August 1966) 1 January 1800 - 30 November 1805 * Evil in a Mask (18 August 1969) February 1807 - September 1809 * The Ravishing of Lady Mary Ware (16 August 1971) September 1809 - 1 January 1813 * The Irish Witch (20 August 1973) 1812 - 1814 * Desperate Measures (2 September 1974) 1814 - 1815 References Category:Fictional secret agents and spies Category:Literary characters introduced in 1947 Category:Novels set during the French Revolutionary War Category:Novels set during the Napoleonic Wars ","title":"Roger Brook"},{"id":"32047869","text":"The MV Finch, also known as the Spirit of Rachel Corrie, was a blockade runner staffed by anti-Israel activists from Malaysia, India, Ireland, and Canada attempting to deliver supplies to Gaza in May 2011 ahead of the Freedom Flotilla Two mission in late June.

It was fought between Government backed forces of the Clan Ross against rebel the forces of the Clan Mackenzie and their allies the Clan Macrae. Background During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the chiefs of the Highland Clan Ross had supported the British-Hanoverian Government. The rising of 1715 was ultimately defeated at the Battle of Sheriffmuir and another rising had been defeated at the Battle of Glenshiel in 1719, where troops from the Clan Ross had fought in support of the Government and defeated the likes of the Jacobite Clan Mackenzie. William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth, chief of Clan Mackenzie, had been exiled in France for his part in the Jacobite rising of 1715 and had also returned briefly to Scotland to take part in the Jacobite rising of 1719, before returning to exile in France. In 1720 two members of the Clan Ross - William Ross, 6th of Easter Fearn (ex-Provost of Tain) and his brother Robert Ross (Baillie of Tain) - had been appointed factors on the estates of Mackenzie of Seaforth, Chisholm and Glenmoriston. The following year, in 1721, they went on an expedition to collect rents on these estates. The Rosses set off from Inverness with thirty armed men, picking up a further fifty armed men from Bernera Barracks. The Murchison family being a sept of the Clan Mackenzie, Colonel Donald Murchison was Mackenzie of Seaforth's factor who had been collecting rents and sending them to his master in France. The battle While on their journey to Mackenzie of Seaforth's lands in Kintail, the Rosses who were attended by just a small company of soldiers met three hundred men of the Clan Mackenzie and their allies the Clan Macrae in Glen Affric. Historian Alan Mackenzie says that the Rosses were \\"ambushed\\" at near Loch Affric. The Mackenzies and Macraes were commanded by Colonel Donald Murchison of Auchtyre and Lochalsh who had been sending the rents to Mackenzie of Seaforth in France. A skirmish took place between the two sides in which the Rosses were outnumbered. William Ross of Easter Fearn was the first to be wounded by shots fired at him from his right. However, he continued to give orders to his troops to advance and clear the ground of lurking clansmen. They had some success in this respect and were able to proceed to a narrow gorge in Kintail which led into Loch Affric, where they were ambushed by Murchison's men. William Ross's son Walter Ross and also his nephew William Ross (son of his brother Robert Ross) were also wounded. Realizing that further resistance was useless William Ross met Colonel Murchison between the lines and discussion took place. The Rosses agreed to return home, promising never again to officiate as factors and as a token of sincerity handed their commissions to Donald Murchison. Aftermath Walter Ross died of his wounds. Colonel Murchison insisted on escorting his foes past a thicket where he alleged a \\"blood thirsty\\" party from the Clan Cameron lurked. On reaching Beauly, Walter Ross was buried in Beauly Priory. A second unsuccessful attempt was made by Government troops to seize Mackenzie of Seaforth's lands by force, in which the Battle of Coille Bhan was indecisive.

West Philippine Sea is the official designation by the Philippine government of eastern parts of the South China Sea which are included in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. The term is also sometimes incorrectly used to refer to the South China Sea as a whole.  Background  The first use of the term \\"West Philippine Sea\\" by the Philippine government was as early as 2011 during the administration of then- President Benigno Aquino III. The naming was intended as symbolic gesture to dispute the China's sovereignty claim over the whole South China Sea. In September 2012, the Philippine government announced that it would start using the name to refer to waters west of the Philippines as \\"West Philippine Sea\\" in government maps, other forms of communication and documents. = 2016 PCA ruling = On July 12, 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of the Philippines. It clarified that it would not \\"...rule on any question of sovereignty over land territory and would not delimit any maritime boundary between the Parties\\". The tribunal also ruled that China has \\"no historical rights\\" based on the \\"nine-dash line\\" map.  Legal scope  In Philippine law, the West Philippine Sea refers to only portions of the South China Sea particularly parts of the sea which the Philippine government claims to be part of the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The naming of the area became official through Administrative Order No. 29 issued by then-President Benigno Aquino III on September 5, 2012. The order also cites Presidential Decree No. 1599 which was issued in 1978 during the tenure of then President Ferdinand Marcos which established the Philippine EEZ as well as the Republic Act No. 9522 or the Baselines Law which was enacted into law in 2009 during the administration of then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo which delineated the baselines of the Philippine archipelago. The administrative order asserts the Philippine claim over its EEZ in the South China Sea which conveys the Philippine government's position that it has sovereign rights under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea over the West Philippine Sea area and \\"inherent power and right to designate its maritime areas with appropriate nomenclature for purposes of the national mapping system\\". There is no exact demarcation for the area in the South China Sea which forms the West Philippine Sea.  Usage  Under the Administrative Order No. 29, the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority is mandated to use the designation West Philippine Sea in maps produced and published by the government agency. Other government agencies are also required to use the term to popularize the use of the name domestically and internationally. Prior to the issuance of the order, the Philippines' weather bureau, PAGASA, adopted the name in 2011 to refer to waters west of the country while remained using \\"Philippine Sea\\" to refer waters east of the archipelago.

In 2005 he was ranked 57 in the Power 100 listing published by Country Life magazine. Heller is notable for having run major rail freight providers in both North America and Europe. Heller was head of the Eastern Region of the Canadian National Railway, at the time the most successful privatised rail business in the world. In 2004, he moved to Europe and became chief executive of English Welsh & Scottish Railway, the largest rail freight operator in the United Kingdom, and subsequently DB Schenker Rail co-chairman and head of the Western Region, covering rail freight across Great Britain, France, Spain and Portugal. Personal life Heller's parents Lorne Nelson Heller and Mildred Sophia Heller (n√©e Schweitzer) married on 10 November 1945 and subsequently jointly ran a hardware store called \\"Rural Hardware\\" from 1953‚Äì1992. Keith Heller grew up on his father's farm in Ontario and attended Elmira District Secondary School. He was the oldest child. Heller married Dolores Smith, and together they had one son, who remains living in Canada. He also has two children from a previous marriage who reside in Canada. Career Heller's first job whilst still at school was working as a baggage porter. =Canada= Heller began with Canadian National Railway (CN) in 1966. By the end of 1993, he had become chief of transportation for CN's North American. In May 1997 CN removed one layer of management and so Heller moved from senior vice- president, CN East, to be senior vice-president, Line Operations. Following the merger between CN and Illinois Central Railroad, CN was split into five regions, and in May 1999 Heller was placed in control of the largest division, the new Eastern Canada Region, described as covering an area the size of Europe. Heller had the reputation of a hard-hitter, with aggressive determination. In 2001 Heller enabled the sale of of city-centre tracks connecting the Michigan Central Railway Bridge through Niagara Falls, Ontario, following diversion of Canadian Pacific Railway trains via CN's International Railway Bridge on 11 December 2001. On 14 February 2003 Heller with another CN executive, Scott Roberts, held a meeting with Gordon McGuinty of the Notre Development Corporation discussing potential plans to use the Adams Mine in Ontario for dumping landfill from Toronto, instead of shipping to Michigan. During a restructuring of CN's executives in mid-2003, Heller continued in his position as senior vice-president for the Eastern Canada Region, and reporting to the Canadian National CEO. Upon being due to retire Heller owned a large number of shares in Canadian National which by 2005 were worth eight-times their original value. =Europe= In January 2004 Heller became the CEO of English, Welsh & Scottish Railway (EWS), Great Britain's largest rail freight operator, taking over from Philip Mengel. Heller previously had his own private train in Canada, and commissioned Interfleet Technology to develop the EWS Company Train for use in Great Britain. In April 2005 Heller invited Queen Elizabeth II to name one of the British Royal Train locomotives 67006 Royal Sovereign in a ceremony at Bristol Temple Meads railway station. Heller was chairman of EWS and involved with its sale to Deutsche Bahn to become DB Schenker Rail (UK), and then DB Cargo UK. When Heller was CEO of EWS and the company was sold to Deutsche Bahn it had 4,900 employees and a turnover of 783 million euros. In 2007 Robert Wright of the Financial Times described Heller as being a \\"well-regarded chief executive\\". In 2009 he was a member of the Rail Safety and Standards Board Sustainable Development Steering Group. Heller initiated a programme of withdrawing British Rail Class 60 locomotives, then overhauling the locomotives as \\"Super 60s\\". Heller retired from Deutsche Bahn in January 2011 and was succeeded by Alain Thauvette also from Canada, who took over the Western Region covering the UK, France, Spain and Portugal. After retirement Heller continued as an adviser to DB Schenker. At the Rail Safety and Standards Board, in his appointment as a non-executive director he was replaced by Neil McDonald in early-2010, also from DB Schenker Rail UK. Heller had been based in the United Kingdom, something which did not occur with his successors until the appointment of Geoff Spencer as CEO of DB Schenker Rail UK in September 2013. =Other companies= Heller was a non- executive director of the company behind the Rail-Pod robotic track geometry car system, and was involved with the Rail-Veyor mining transportation system. Heller was a non-executive director of UK Coal, serving on the board of directors, on the audit committee, nomination committee and as chair of the health & Safety Committee. Heller's salary and fees for being a non-executive director of UK Coal were paid to the Canadian company S/Dolo, Inc. At the end of 2012 Heller transferred from the board of UK Coal Plc, to oversee the creation of the UK Coal Employee Benefit Trust responsible for 67% of the voting rights on behalf of former employees. Philanthropy In 2009 Heller made a donation of over $100,000 to the University of Western Ontario. In 2014 the Heller Family Foundation covered the cost of repainting the Canadian Railway Museum's locomotive number 1382 in traditional yellow and green livery. In 2016 the Heller's foundation funded computers for 256 pupils and staff at schools within Carrillo, in the Guanacaste Province of Costa Rica in conjunction with educational programmes arranged by the Quir√≥s Tanzi Foundation. Heller is a vice-president of the UK-based Railway Benevolent Institution/Railway Benefit Fund. He became a vice-president in 2011 at the same time as Matthew Parris and Tom Harris. Recognition Heller was invited by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport to deliver their annual Sir Robert Reid lecture on 6 February 2008. He became only the second lecturer from a freight background. The lecture was entitled \\"Creating a Stronger European Rail Freight Network\\", and was chaired by Richard Brown with Chris Green leading the formal vote of thanks.
