She was born Lady Anne Wesley, the only daughter of Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington, and the Hon. Anne Hill, daughter of Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon. On 7 January 1790 she married Henry FitzRoy, son of the first Baron Southampton and Anne Warren, the daughter and co-heir of Peter Warren (Royal Navy officer) and a descendant of the Schuyler family, the Van Cortlandt family, and the Delancey family, all from British North America. They had two daughters: * Anne Caroline Fitzroy, died 16 December 1835 * Georgiana Frederica Fitzroy (3 October 1792 - 11 May 1821), married 25 July 1814 Henry Somerset, Marquess of Worcester, with two daughters. FitzRoy died on 19 March 1794 in Lisbon due to consumption. Anne's brother Henry came down to Lisbon to bring her back to England. However, on their way back, their ship, the ship was captured by a French frigage and the siblings were taken prisoners. In January 1795, Anne was freed. Anne remarried on 2 August 1799 to Charles Culling Smith, having two more children: * Emily Frances Smith (3 March 1800 - 2 October 1889), married 29 June 1822 her half-sister's widower Lord Worcester, who succeeded his father as 7th Duke of Beaufort in 1835. They had one son and six daughters. * Frederick William Culling Smith (died 19 June 1828), a godson of the Duke of York. He was made a Page of Honour on 13 March 1812 and commissioned as a Cornet in the 2nd Dragoon Guards on 22 April 1819. He transferred into the Coldstream Guards as an Ensign on 18 January 1820 and reached the rank of Lieutenant in that regiment before promotion to the Royal Horse Guards as a Captain on 2 January 1823. On 1 August 1826 he was promoted to the rank of Major of Infantry on the unattached list, and joined the 80th Regiment of Foot on 17 January 1828. He died at Malta later that year, aged twenty-six. On 25 July 1814 Lady Anne's daughter Georgiana Frederica FitzRoy (born 3 October 1792) married Henry Somerset, Marquess of Worcester, who had served the Duke of Wellington as an aide-de-camp during the Peninsular War. Lady Worcester was Wellington's favourite niece, and her death in great pain (\\"I did not know death could hurt so much\\") on 11 May 1821 was a great blow to him and all her friends. On 29 June 1822 Lord Worcester married Lady Anne's other daughter Emily Frances (born 3 March 1800), greatly to the annoyance of Wellington, who was never close to his sister afterwards. On 23 November 1835 Emily Frances became Duchess of Beaufort. Lady Anne Culling Smith died on 16 December 1844, at Hampton Court.The Gentleman's Magazine, vol. XXIII (1845) p. 108.

The cemetery was used by Quakers, but the chapel is not a Quaker structure. Quakers generally refer to a structure built for worship as a meeting house, rather than as a chapel or church. History A meeting of the Religious Society of Friends was founded at the site in 1789, and served by a log meeting house until 1793 when a stone building was constructed. John Cope bought 15 acres for the use of the meeting in 1793. There were many early Quaker settlers in this area of southwestern Pennsylvania with nine Quaker meetings founded within 15 miles of Brownsville, which is about 9 miles southwest of this site. Few of these early Quaker structures survive, but several cemeteries are intact. The Quaker population in the area began to decline about 1830, caused by western migration, the \\"Great Separation\\" between Hicksite and Orthodox Quakers, and controversy surrounding Quakers during the abolition movement and the Civil War. Between 1850 and 1870 most Quaker meetings in the area were closed, with the Providence Meeting closed in 1870. By 1895 the meeting house was a ruin standing in the middle of an active cemetery. Elma Cope Binns organized the rebuilding of the meeting house into a smaller chapel constructed from the stone of the original building. Fourteen acres of the meeting's land was sold, leaving one acre for the cemetery. Architecture The chapel measures 20 feet by 30 feet. It is built in a simple vernacular style and the stone is roughly coursed. There is no steeple, but a fireplace and chimney were built at the east and west ends. The two windows on both the north and south sides are not glazed, but blocked by iron bars. No door is present in the doorway on the south side. The cemetery contains approximately 500 burials. In the early Quaker tradition, most graves were unmarked. About 50 tombstones are currently standing. The graves generally date from approximately 1790 to 1870, when the meeting house closed, though modern tombstones date as late as 2003. An iron fence surrounds the cemetery, except for a 125-foot section of modern chain link fencing. Note: This includes It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

It is part of the Ocotl√°n District in the south of the Valles Centrales Region Its population is less than 5,000, but it was the scene of a number of violent confrontations in the 2000s. The town is known for its crafts, especially fine embroidery and items made with a flower known as flor inmortal (\\"immortal flower\\"), so called because it does not lose its color when it is dried. The name San Antonino is in honor of Anthony of Padua, who is the town's patron saint. ‚ÄúCastillo Velasco‚Äù (sometimes ‚ÄúCastillo Velazco‚Äù) was added in honor of Jos√© Mar√≠a Castillo Velasco, who was born here in 1820 and played important roles in the Reform War and French Intervention in Mexico. History The town was founded in 1649 by Nicol√°s Hern√°ndez, Mart√≠n √Ångel Toledo and Manuel Salmer√≥n on lands which had been granted to their families earlier in the colonial era. The settlement was officially declared a town in 1889. Access to water has been a problem for farmers here since the 1960s, when severe restrictions on access were placed, and the sinking of groundwater dried up almost half of the wells. Farmers complain that the government is unfairly restricting access while businesses and housing divisions are given freer access. The Coordinadora de Pueblos Unidos por la Defensa del Agua is based in the town in order to protect farmers‚Äô rights. This group claims that the lack of water is making the farming of flowers and vegetables untenable and forcing farmers to migrate to the United States. The water commission says that many farmers‚Äô use of water is excessive and the restrictions are necessary. The early years of the 21st century have been a time of conflict and violence for the municipality. The police commander of the municipality was assassinated in 2003. The events of the 2006 Oaxaca protests have had serious impact on the municipality, as it was listed among the twenty-nine municipalities classified to be in social and political conflict by state electoral authorities. In 2006, the municipal palace was taken by APPO sympathizers who accused the municipal government of serious irregularities and corruption. A general assembly was called and the disavowal of municipal government was approved, replacing it with the ‚ÄúAyuntamiento Popular de San Antonino Castillo Velasco‚Äù (People's City Council of San Antonino Castillo Velasco). Municipal palace This government immediately declared sympathy with APPO and Section 22 of the SNTE teachers‚Äô union. This event divided the residents of the community, but with a majority supporting the new government and APPO. A rock smashed the window of the main door of the house of Gonzalo Alonso Garc√≠a, who was recognized by the PRI as the municipal president in 2006, but most of the violence since 2006 has been blamed on the ousted municipal government of Joel L√≥pez S√°nchez and the PRI political party which has ruled Oaxaca since 1929. In 2006, a 49-year-old voluntary policeman was killed by gunshots. The event was blamed on PRI sympathizers although no one was arrested. The People's council continued to govern and occupy the municipal palace, with a number of supporters protecting the building at night. In 2007, there was an attempt to dislodge these supporters during the night with one assault at around midnight and the other at about 5 am. The leader of the People's City Council, Juan Valent√≠n Aguilar P√©rez, stated that the 100 or so PRI supporters were led by the former municipal president personally. The attempt was not successful. The confrontation between the People's Council and PRI resulted in over 25 injured, including Aguilar P√©rez and three members of Radio Calenda. The PRI forces detained about a dozen or so, who were released later after intervention by the federal government. Later, Oaxaca state authorities arrested four PRI sympathizers accused of participating in the 2007 assault on occupiers of the municipal palace and the illegal detainment of several protesters during the event. This situation remained until the municipal elections of 2007, which required extra security. However, the violence has not completely ended. Radio Calenda (http://www.radiocalenda.com/radio.html) is one of a number of ‚Äúcommunity radio stations‚Äù which operate in rural areas of Mexico, often without a license. However, Calenda has an operating license. Most of the staff at the radio station are volunteers. The station reports local news and also broadcasts in local indigenous languages. The station has operated since 2006, when it was part of the social uprisings. Since that time, it has been a target of pro-PRI forces, especially those loyal to the former municipal president. In November 2008, the radio station was assaulted. Since then a number of the assailants have been arrested but threats continue. The Asociacion Mundial de Radios Comunitarias de Mexico (World Association of Community Radio of Mexico) or AMARC has issued a plea to federal and state authorities to protect the station and arrest the former municipal president, who they claim is behind the attacks. Since the early 2000s, there has been a boundary dispute between San Antonino and Ocotl√°n de Morelos. At that time, Ocotl√°n sold an area called ‚ÄúBarratillo de Ocotl√°n‚Äù to San Antonino, but the exact boundaries of the land sold have been in dispute ever since. In 2003, there was a confrontation between the two municipalities over that area, but a more significant one occurred in 2009. The confrontation was sparked by the placement of a sign on Federal Highway 175 by the Secretariat of Communication and Transportation and the municipality of San Antonino to indicate the latter's existence to travelers. However, Ocotl√°n claims the land on which the sign was being erected. The confrontation resulted in injuries to both parties and the use of tear gas by the state police to break it up. The social unrest since 2006 has hurt local craftsmen as tourists and other buyers are scared away by the violence. The town and its crafts Facade of the parish church San Antonio is a Zapotec community, which is a suburb of Ocotl√°n de Morelos. The parish church was built in the 17th century and dedicated to Anthony of Padua. This church is the focus of several religious celebrations including the feast of the Se√±or de la Sacrist√≠a on 19 February. The Day of the Dead is also an important commemoration here with music and offerings laid on the tombs of the dead. The town of San Antonino participates in the annual Martes de Brujas which takes place in San Bartolo Coyotepec. Women come to sell tamales and atole, which recalls the origins of the commemoration, when women served these foods to men working on the construction of a church. This event takes place during the period of Lent. The town also has a ‚Äúcasa de cultura,‚Äù literally ‚Äúhouse of culture,‚Äù called the Casa De La Cultura El Jard√≠n del Valle. This is a cultural center for residents, which offers classes in theatre, music, sculpture, painting and ceramics. It also hosts exhibits. There are two market days, Friday and Sunday. On these days, San Antonino's locally renowned breads are more available although they are often sold out by the afternoon. While craft stores are not common here like in other towns, crafts such as embroidered clothing and items made with dried flowers can be seen on these days. There is one permanent store called Artesanias de Castillo Velasco, which is on the entrance road to the town center from the highway. This store offers embroidered dresses, blouses, napkins and more. However, if visitors ask, locals can lead them to any of the various women known for their work here. The two main crafts of this town are embroidered clothing and arrangements and decorations with dried flowers. Most of the clothing which is embroidered is for women, but there are embroidered shirts for men as well. The dresses are the most expensive and most coveted and are used mostly by indigenous women of the area. They are often called ‚ÄúOaxacan wedding dresses‚Äù and are marked by their intricate designs with animas and flowers. These dresses sell at a minimum of US$100. The embroidery style is called ‚Äúa ver si puedes‚Äù (Let's see if you can) or ‚Äúhazme si puedes‚Äù (Make me if you can). Both names refer to the difficulty of the embroidery due to the large number of very small elements. Most embroiderers learn the craft from their mothers and grandmothers, with larger items such as dresses taking months of work to complete. Pieces of this style are on display at the Textile Museum of Oaxaca. The museum was organized by sisters Reina Cornelio S√°nchez and Antonina Cornelio S√°nchez. The purpose of the museum is to promote the craft and appreciation of it. One other craft associated with the town are arrangements made with a flower called the flor inmortal (\\"immortal flower\\"). The flower is called this because it does not lose its color when it is dried. These arrangements were originally made for religious purposes and still many objects made with this flower are of the religious type. Many of the orders for crafts made with the flor inmortal are for religious ceremonies, such as festivals for patron saints, such as church decorations. The flower primarily comes in three colors, yellow, red and white. Many of those who produce works in the flower, grow the primary material themselves, which takes about four months to mature. Crops are harvested in the fall, so the flower appears in abundance for Day of the Dead and the annual Noche de R√°banos (Night of the Radishes) festival in the city of Oaxaca. One other craft here is basketry, especially those items made in association with flor inmortal arrangements. The municipality As municipal seat, the town of San Antonino Castillo Velazco is the governing authority over the communities of Lachicuvica, Esquina de la Piedra, La Azucena and El Zompantle, as well as unsettled lands with total an area of 33.17km2. About 95% of the municipality's population of 4829 (2005) lives in the town proper. 874 people speak an indigenous language. The municipality borders the municipalities of San Juan Chilateca, Ocotl√°n de Morelos, Santa Catarina Minas, San Miguel Tilquiapam and San Baltazar Chichicapam. The municipality is located in a depression in the Sierra Madre del Sur. The main river is the Atoyac. The climate is classed as (K√∂epen) (A)(C(wo), moderately hot and semi arid. Average high temperature is 18C and average low is 7C, with a range of 22C to 5C. The rainy season extends from May to October. There is little wild flora or fauna because all the available flat land is used for agriculture or livestock. In more hilly areas there are grasslands and semi arid area plants such as mesquite and guaje (Leucaena leucocephala ). Fauna include marmosa, rabbits, squirrels and some snakes and birds. Agriculture is important here with principle crops being flowers, corn, beans and castor oil plants. There is also widespread production of cattle. This employs about 40% of the population. The soil here consists of a thin layer of decomposed volcanic rock with ten cm or less depth. Two important crops culturally are the ‚Äúflor inmortal‚Äù (lit. immortal flower) and radishes. The flowers are used for decorative purposes, especially in connection with religious festivals, and many of the craftspeople who make the decorations grow the flowers themselves. Radishes are grown for the annual ‚ÄúNoche de R√°banos‚Äù (Radish Night) festival, which is held in Oaxaca city each year. During this event, the radishes are carved into sculptures, which are often adorned with flores inmortales and other items, and judged. Mezcal and various crafts are made, but this only employs about 12% of the population. A large part of the population (46%) is employed in commerce.

Career Medany made her Olympic debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics at the age of 15. She was the youngest on the Egyptian team and the youngest out of any of the athletes competing in the pentathlon. She finished in 28th place overall. She won the Olympic test event in Beijing, China, meaning that she qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics. She went into the Olympics competing once more for Egypt after conducting pre-games training in South Korea. The pentathlon event was due to take place on the final day of the Games, and as Egypt had only won a single bronze medal up until that point, she was highlighted as a potential medal winner towards the end of the Games despite having only placed in the top three of junior competitions prior to that point. However on the day, Medany found the horse she was randomly assigned for the riding part of the pentathlon was unwieldy, resulting her in finishing in eighth place overall. She later said of the media response, \\"They put everything on the riding being bad, and me needing an improvement in riding. It wasn't really my fault.\\" She won the World Cup event held in Sz√°zhalombatta, Budapest in 2011, ahead of the Olympic champion Lena Schoneborn and British athlete Mhairi Spence who finished in third place.

In March 2013 she announced retirement. Personal life Medany began wearing a hijab after the 2008 Summer Olympics, despite the fact she says it gives her a disadvantage whilst running. She is considering retirement from the sport following the 2012 Summer Olympics due to the ban on full-body swimsuits imposed by the swimming federation FINA, which pentathlon takes its swimming rules from. Medany wants to swim in an outfit conforming to the Muslim faith, while the swimming requirements state that outfits \\"shall not cover the neck, extend past the shoulder, nor extend below the knee\\".

It opened on May 10, 2009. The ride was previously located at Six Flags New Orleans under the names Bayou Blaster and Sonic Slam; after the park closed due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the ride was moved to Great Escape. The current name is derived from the cryptid Sasquatch. Ride History The ride first opened in 2000 as Bayou Blaster and Sonic Slam at a new park called Jazzland. Then Six Flags took over the lease of the park in 2002 and changed the name to Six Flags New Orleans in 2003. After Hurricane Katrina hit the park on August 29, 2005, the park was severely flooded from the hurricane and has remained closed since. Six Flags decided to relocate several rides, such as Batman: The Ride, which was removed in 2007 and taken to Six Flags Fiesta Texas where it was refurbished and reopened on April 18, 2008 under the new name Goliath. The Bayou Blaster and the Sonic Slam were dismantled in 2008 and relocated to Great Escape, where the ride was refurbished, repainted, and renamed Sasquatch. The ride was officially opened on May 10, 2009 on the former spot of Rainbow, which closed after the 2007 season. Sasquatch is currently sponsored by Jack Link's Beef Jerky. Ride experience The ride contains two shafts or towers, a lift tower and a drop tower. On the drop tower, riders are easily brought to the top and then dropped extremely fast down most of it, then brought up not as high, then dropped at the same speed. This continues several more times before the ride ends. On the lift tower, riders are shot to the top in three seconds, then dropped not as fast as the drop tower drops, then brought back up at the same speed, then dropped slowly. This continues until the ride ends like the drop tower. The correct name for the two towers are Launch and Drop. The Launch Tower shoots passengers over into the air in 3 seconds and slowly drops them down. The Drop tower launches passengers slowly and drops them in three seconds.

It is in the Centro District of the Valles Centrales region about fifteen km south of the capital of Oaxaca. The town is best known for its Barro negro pottery - black clay pottery. For hundreds of years pottery has been made here with a gray matte finish, but in the 1950s a technique was devised to give the pieces a shiny black finish without painting. This has made the pottery far more popular and collectable. The town is home to the Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca (State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca) which was opened here in 2004, with a large portion of its collection consisting of barro negro pottery. There is also a barro negro mural on the recently opened Baseball Academy. History The area was the settled homeland of the ancient Mesoamerican Zapotec civilization going back at least 2500 years, with the oldest archeological finds being in the Valley of Oaxaca. Its Zapotec language name is Zaapeche, place of many jaguars (Panthera onca). In 1521, the area became an encomiendo under Bartolom√© S√°nchez who named the settlement, San Jacinto Leontepec. Later, this was changed to the current name. San Bartolo refers to the patron saint, Bartholomew and Coyotepec is from Nahuatl meaning \\"hill of coyotes.\\" Zaachila Zapotec is spoken in the town. at Ethnologue =Pottery community of 2,000 years= San Bartolo is a Zapotec community, which has been making pottery for about 2,000 years. The clay of this area produces a distinctive color, which for most of San Bartolo's history was a Grey matte. This clay has been used to produce utilitarian objects such as jars, dishes and other storage containers. The Church of San Bartolo, with ancient Zapotec civilization Pyramids in the left background.The techniques for making the pottery have changed little during these centuries, with plates serving as potters‚Äô wheels and design remaining traditional. One change has been the replacement of underground pits by kilns for firing the pieces. However, the most important innovation has been a polishing method devised by ceramic artist and potter Do√±a Rosa in the 1950s. Do√±a Rosa discovered that by polishing the nearly dry clay before firing, the gray color turned to a shiny black. This has made the pottery far more popular, and many pieces are produced now for decorative purposes rather than utilitarian. Since then, the aesthetic qualities of \\"barro negro\\" (black clay) pottery has become further appreciated due to the work of artisan- sculpture Carlomagno Pedro Martinez, who has displayed his barro negro work nationally and internationally. =Spanish era= The end of the Pre-Columbian era arrived with Spanish conquest and occupation of the Zapotec peoples region in 1521. It was first renamed 'San Jacinto Le√≥ntepec,' It then changed again to 'San Bartolom√© Coyotepec,' by Bartolom√© Sanchez, a soldier of Hern√°n Cort√©s awarded a local Encomienda. The first church was built in 1532. From its Spanish foundation was one of the larger settlements with three neighborhoods. This settlement was laid out by the same architect that designed the city of Oaxaca. Vicente Guerrero passed through here after he was taken prisoner, and Porfirio D√≠az hid here during the French Intervention in Mexico. The town The center of the town is similar to that of the city of Oaxaca, with a main plaza, parish church and municipal palace. The eastern side of the main plaza is dominated by a ceiba tree. In the tianguis or other markets, one can find regional dishes such as mole negro, mole coloradito, cequeza, higaditos and stews made from chicken or turkey. There are some pre-Hispanic remains of buildings which were ceremonial centers or houses for the ruling class. The rest of the town is divided into three neighborhoods called \\"centro\\" or \\"San Bartolo,\\" \\"San Mateo\\" and in the north \\"Santa Mar√≠a.\\" Very near there are two other communities called Animas Trujano and San Juan Bautistas la Raya founded around the same time as San Bartolo Coyotepec, but they are not considered part of the town proper. Next to the town is the hill called Zaapech or Jaguar Mountain which has always been considered sacred. One of the major festivals here is Candlemas. The patron saint, Bartholomew the Apostle is feasted in August. During festivals such as these, local traditional dances such as De la Pluma and De los Jardineros Moros y Cristianos can be seen. Both date from the Spanish Conquest. =Mercado Artesanal (Crafts Market)= However two of the main attractions for the town are Mercado Artesanal (Crafts Market) filled mostly with barro negro pottery and the Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca (State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca). =State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca - MEAPO= Display of local Textile arts at MEAPO - State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca.The Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca - MEAPO, the State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca, was founded in 2004 to promote and preserve the traditional crafts of this state. The museum was designed by and is cared for by a commission of craftsmen from San Bartolo Coyotepec. The museum sponsors events such as the \\"Tianguis artisanal\\", a crafts flea market, along with other civic groups. :The museum has three halls. *The first exhibits some of the finest pieces of barro negro pottery from San Bartolo Coyotepec as well as archeological finds from the area. *The second contains 92 pieces of prizewinners from the Concurso Estatal de Cer√°mica \\"Benito Ju√°rez\\" (Benito Juarez State Ceramics Competition) which is sponsored by the 'Artesanias e Industrias Populares del Estado de Oaxaca' -ARIPO, and contains various types of pottery and ceramics from Santa Maria Atzompa, San Marcos Tlapazola, Tamazulapan, Ocotl√°n, and San Antonino Castillo Velasco. *The third hall contains examples of the woodworking of the San Mart√≠n Tilcajete community. Craftsmen from this community helped with the building of the museum and Masks are the featured item here. The permanent collection contains pieces from about 300 artisans in Oaxaca. The museum's roots extend to 1905, when local resident Manuel Guzm√°n donated land for the establishment of a cultural center. The site was used first as a municipal library and then as a primary school. However, it was not until 1994 when a group of youths worked to build a museum that would be dedicated to barro negro pottery. That same year, the state government allocated 25,000 pesos to rehabilitate the building on the site, and local artist Carlomagno Pedro Martinez raised 80,000 pesos to install modern equipment. In 1996, the museum was founded as the community museum, with its initial collection. In that year, it sponsored, along with ARIPO - Artesan√≠as e Industrias Populares del estado de Oaxaca, the first crafts competition. The museum struggled for a while financially until it signed a cooperation agreement with the 'Instituto Oaxaque√±o de las Culturas,' the Oaxaca Institute of Cultures, which required a restructuring of the museum. In 2002, the community museum closed with the aim of building the current one. In 2004, the current museum opened with the aim of presenting the crafts history of the entire state of Oaxaca, Mexico. The museum has held temporary exhibits such as \\"Mujeres tejiendo historias\\" (Women knitting stories), \\"Grandes Maestros del Arte Popular de Oaxaca\\" (Grand Masters of Popular Art in Oaxaca) and \\"Historia y evoluci√≥n del barro negro\\" (History and evolution of barro negro pottery). The new museum opened with new furniture and designed to international standards. The idea is to create a collection of popular art that represents the eight regions of the state of Oaxaca. The mission is to promote Oaxacan handcrafts and popular art to the state's, Mexican, and international communities, as well as foster exchanges among artisans and promote tourism based on crafts. This includes the weaving and textile arts in Oaxacan traditions. The museum was built here to decentrale state cultural institutions. The museum offers guided tours in Spanish and English, workshops for adults and children, and spaces to rent for events. Barro negro pottery Barro negro pottery in the metallic finish at the Do√±a Rosa Workshop =Do√±a Rosa= For almost all of the town's history, the color of the local pottery was a dull dark gray, until Do√±a Rosa Real discovered a way to create a shiny black finish t create barro negro pottery. The innovation made the pottery more popular and famous, with Nelson Rockefeller having a collection of her pieces. Do√±a Rosa died in 1980, but the tradition of making the barro negro pottery is being carried on by Do√±a Rosa's daughter and grandchildren who stage demonstrations for tourists. The workshop is still in the family home, where shelves and shelves of shiny black pieces for sale line the inner courtyard. Despite being the origin of black polished clay, the pieces at the Do√±a Rosa Workshop are less expensive than in other parts of Mexico. =The Cantaro= A cantaro jar for serving mezcal. Two pottery pieces which are indicative of San Bartolo are the traditional Cantaro, a large jar which can be used for liquid storage or as a musical instrument and the \\"chango mezcalero\\" or mezcal monkey. This is a clay container in the shape of a monkey to hold mezcal, Oaxaca main distilled spirit, which has become a collectable folk art item. The container can be painted in bright colors or left in its gray color with detailed etching. The small opening at the top is plugged by a stopper of cork or corncob. These bottles are sized to hold about 700 to 1000 milliliters of liquid and were originally meant to serve as decorative containers in bars. Two families claim to have originated this clay bottle. The first is that of Do√±a Rosa. The family believes that Do√±a Rosa's husband, Juventino Nieto, invented the design at the request of cantina operators from the city of Oaxaca. Other animal forms were also designed as created as well, but the monkey one gained notoriety. The other family to lay claim to the mezcal monkey is that of Marcelo Sim√≥n Galan, now deceased. This family claims that he used to travel with his grey pottery pieces, which included water bottles and jars. Like the Do√±a Rosa family, this family claims the design was created upon request, with Marcelo doing the potting and others the painting. One of Marcelo's mezcal monkeys is on display at the state crafts museum. =Carlomagno Pedro Martinez= \\"Mural de la Conquista\\" by artist Carlomagno Pedro Mart√≠nez at the State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca- MEAPOAnother promoter of barro negro pottery from San Bartolo Coyotepec is Carlomagno Pedro Martinez. He was born here into a pottery-making family. He was named after Charlemagne by his grandmother, who was an admirer of the king. From a young age showed talent in fashioning figures in clay. When he was grown, he attended the Fine Arts Workshop of Rufino Tamayo in Oaxaca city. He has become the first potter-artist-sculptor in the medium, winning his first recognition in 1985 for his work Tlaquepaque, Jalisco. His fame increased with his development of human skulls made of barro negro in the years that followed. In Mexico, he has exhibited his work in dozens of expositions and has won three national level awards. His work has also been featured in five published books. Martinez's work has been exhibited in countries such as the United States, Colombia, Argentina, Lebanon, Germany, Spain, and Japan, with one of the latest exhibits in New York City in 2008. In that same year, he created a mural in barro negro at the Baseball Academy in San Bartolo Coyotepec sponsored by the Alfredo Harp Hel√∫ Foundation. Each piece Carlomagno makes is unique in some way, but certain themes such as oral histories, indigenous legends, certain Christian themes and death, called \\"our grandmother.\\" The municipality As municipal seat, the town of San Bartolo Coyotepec is the governing authority for the seven other communities: Reyes Mantec√≥n, Cuarta Secci√≥n, La Guelavaca (El Tule), El Guapo (San Francisco), La Magdalena, La Soledad, Paraje la Colorada and Paraje la Era. Together these communities cover an area of 45.93km2 and have a total population of just over 8,000 people.(inegi) The municipality borders the municipalities of Santa Mar√≠a Coyotepec, Santa Catarina Quiane, San Mart√≠n Tilcajete, Santo Tom√°s Jalieza, San Juan Teitipac and Villa de Zaachila. The most important elevations are Piedra Redonda, Chivaguia Grande, Chivaguia Chica, Guinise Grande, Loma del Cuche, La Pe√±as and Guibetes. The Atoyac and Valiente Rivers pass through here. The municipality has a temperate climate with winds mostly from the north. Agriculture employ about 19% of the population growing vegetables such as corn, beans and squash blossom, as well as decorative flowers such as daisies, Mexican marigolds and poinsettias. Orchards here produce oranges, mangos, mamey sapotes, black sapotes, guavas and other tropical fruit. Livestock includes domestic fowl, pigs, cattle and sheep. About 33% are involved in mining and industry, with most of this population dedicated to the making of barro negro pottery. The rest of the population, about 45% is employed in commerce. =Padre, family, and community= In 1997, Father Manuel Marinero announced that he was in love with a member of the parish church. The Catholic Church responded by immediately putting an end to Marinero's 24-year career as a priest. However, since then the local community has continued to support him as their spiritual leader. At least as of 2002, the town of San Bartolo Coyotepec has officially been without a priest as Marinero is not recognized. However, the people here still called him \\"Padre\\" (Father) and he continues to live in the house that has been traditionally reserved for parish priests with his wife and two children. The Church has asked him to move but the house belongs to the town and the residents want him to stay. It is not unknown for Mexican priests to have significant others, but it is kept hidden and numbers are not known. Marinero's case is unusual because it is public. Beginning in 2004, Marinero began to publicly support gay marriage as well =Academy of Baseball= In 2009 the Academy of Baseball was founded in San Bartolo Coyotepec by Alfredo Harp Hel√∫. The academy has six instructors and can accommodate sixty students of between fourteen and seventeen years of age. The goal is to prepare young people who hope to have a career in the sport, while supporting the completion of their education. It is the first of its kind in Mexico and the founder hopes that there will be more. The facilities cover more than ten hectares and include a library, computer center, three baseball fields, and living quarters for students. Murals were commissioned for the project including \\"El camino del Sol for el cielo\\" by Jos√© Luis Garcia and a barro negro mural by Carlomagno Pedro called \\"Juego en el inframundo.\\" See also *Category: Mexican potters **Category: Pre- Columbian pottery **Ceramic art *Valley of Oaxaca **Rodolfo Morales **Rufino Tamayo References External links * Danza de la Pluma Category:Municipalities of Oaxaca Category:Mexican potters Category:Mexican art ","title":"San Bartolo Coyotepec"},{"id":"23203733","text":"San Bartolom√© Ayautla Tierra del Achiote y el Mamey is a town and municipality in Oaxaca in south-western Mexico.

Various Franco-Indian alliances were formed between France and Indian polities between the 18th century to the ascent of Napoleon. Following the alliances of Dupleix, a formal alliance was formed between by Louis XVI's France during the late 18th century in an attempt to oust Great Britain from the Indian subcontinent. Later, numerous proposals of alliance were made by Tipu Sultan, leading to the dispatch of a French fleet of volunteers to help him, and even motivating an effort by Napoleon to make a junction with India, through the 1798 Campaign of Egypt. Early French involvement Dupleix meeting the Soudhabar of the Deccan, Murzapha Jung. In the 17th century, Fran√ßois Bernier (1625‚Äì1688), a French physician and traveler, became the personal physician of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb for 12 years. In the early 18th century, France was actively involved in the powerplay in India. The French General Dupleix was allied to Murzapha Jung in the Deccan, and Chanda Sahib in the Carnatic Wars, in the conflict against Robert Clive of the East India Company. These relationships were beneficial to the French, and French allies gifted areas such as the Alamparai Fort in return for the services provided by the French against the British. The French succeeded in the Battle of Madras in 1746, and the French and Indians fought together and vanquished Anwaruddin in 1749, but failed in the Battle of Arcot in 1751 and finally surrendered in 1752.Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare, p. 160 The French again had a success at the capture of Fort St. David in 1758 under Lally, but were finally defeated at Masulipatam (1759) and Wandewash (1760).Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare, p. 160 Alliance of Louis XVI The Maratha Peshwa Madhav Rao Narayan formed an alliance with Louis XVI in 1782. Here, in Poona in 1792. French had lost preeminence in India with the Treaty of Paris in 1763, although five trading posts were being maintained there, leaving opportunities for disputes and power-play with Great Britain. France was successful in supporting the American War of Independence in 1776, and wished to expel the British from India as well. In 1782, Louis XVI sealed an alliance with the Peshwa Madhav Rao Narayan. As a consequence Bussy moved his troops to √éle de France (Mauritius) and later contributed to the French effort in India in 1783.The influence of sea power upon history, 1660‚Äì1783 by Alfred Thayer Mahan p.461 Suffren became the ally of Hyder Ali in the Second Anglo-Mysore War against British rule in India, in 1782-1783, fighting the British fleet on the coasts of India and Ceylon.Britain as a military power, 1688-1815 by Jeremy Black, p Between February 1782 and June 1783, Suffren fought the English admiral Sir Edward Hughes, and collaborated with the rulers of Mysore.Britain as a military power, 1688-1815 by Jeremy Black, pCambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare, p.159 Suffren fought in the Battle of Sadras on February 17, 1782, the Battle of Providien on April 12 near Trincomalee, the Battle of Negapatam on July 6 off Cuddalore, after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender. An army of 3,000 French soldiers collaborated with Hyder Ali to capture Cuddalore. Finally, the Battle of Trincomalee took place near that port on September 3. These battles can be seen as the last battles of the Franco-British conflict that encompassed the American War of Independence, and would cease with the signature of the Treaty of Versailles of 1783 establishing peace and recognizing America independence. =Proposals of Tipu Sultan= Louis XVI receives the ambassadors of Tipu Sultan in 1788, Voyer after Emile Wattier, 19th century. Following the 1783 Treaty of Versailles and the removal of French support, Tipu Sultan, the son of Hyder Ali, was unable to recover Mangalore from the British, although he managed to re-capture it after a 10-month siege in 1784.Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare, p. 162 He finally made peace with the British in spring 1784.Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare, p. 162 In 1786, Tipu Sultan nevertheless sent an embassy to France through Constantinople, but the embassy had to be cancelled. In July 1787, Tipu Sultan sent a new embassy directly to Paris, formed of three ambassadors Mohammed Dervich Khan, Akbar Ali Khan and Mohammad Osman Khan, who were accompanied by the French trader from Pondicherry, M. Monneron. After arriving in Toulon, the ambassadors were able to meet with Louis XVI in August 1788 in Versailles. However, France, which was now at peace with London, did not wish to resume hostilities.Napoleon and Persia by Iradj Amini p.11 Elisabeth Vig√©e- Lebrun: Portrait of Mohammed Dervish Khan, Tipu's ambassador to France (1788) Tipu Sultan again proposed an offensive and defensive alliance to France in October 1794, and April 1796.Napoleon and Persia by Iradj Amini p.11 France was hampered in its support to India by the French Revolution, but contacts would resume with the rise of Napol√©on.Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare, p. 162 In 1794, with the support of French Republican officers, Tipu helped found the Jacobin Club of Mysore for 'framing laws comfortable with the laws of the Republic' He planted a Liberty Tree and declared himself Citizen Tipoo.

Great Britain signed a mutual defense treaty with Shah Shuja al-Mulk of Afghanistan on 17 June 1809 in order to better resist the Franco-Persian threat, but by that time Persia had already denounced its alliance with France and was moving towards Great Britain.The Islamic world in decline by Martin Sicker p.97-98 These last events rendered the Franco-Indian alliance impossible to pursue further. =Harohalli French Cemetery= There exists a French cemetery in Harohalli, where the French who came to aid Tipu Sultan are buried. The beautiful cemetery is more than 250 years old, but sadly lies in a state of neglect, with most graves vandalised by the local people. The French soldiers and family members died either by malaria, fatigue or in battle. The land for the French cemetery was granted by Tipu Sultan. Only 35 graves exist at present and most of them in a bad state. The locals have vandalised the graves to remove the iron grills, bricks, metal plaques and expensive marble. Many graves are left without any headstone.

Hancock of Rhyll Manor, East Anstey, where the kennels were located.https://eastanstey.org.uk/history/ A follower of the Devon and Somerset wrote that \\"the outstanding figure, with the widest knowledge of the sport and of all that it implied, the best supporter of it, the readiest friend of all, be they natives of the west country or visitors it, in a word the most respected, admired, popular man on Exmoor was Froude Hancock of Wiveliscombe.\\"Unpublished memoirs of H H Gordon Clark A memorial stone of granite was placed on Anstey Common two years after his death, on a spot from which Hancock watched the hunt in his old age. Rugby career Hancock with the first touring Barbarians. Hancock is back row, 2nd from right, with hat. Hancock began playing rugby for local club, Wiveliscombe, before playing for first class English side Richmond. In 1886 Hancock was selected for his first international game, when he was selected to represent England against Wales in the 1886 Home Nations Championship. He was reselected for the very next match against Ireland at Lansdowne Road, but missed the final game, the Championship decider, against Scotland. The 1886 Championship also saw the last international match for Hancock's brother, Frank, who had moved to Wales and represented the Welsh team. Frank missed the game against England which would have seen the brothers face each other, but was captain of the Welsh side that faced Scotland seven days later. Hancock played one final game for England, four years later, in the 1890 Championship. This game saw the reintroduction of England after two years away from the international scene, and resulted in the country's first defeat to Wales. In 1890, Hancock became an original member of William Percy Carpmael's newly formed invitational tourists, the Barbarians, becoming one of the few early members not to have a university background. Hancock went on several Easter tours with the Barbarians, scoring a try against Norman Biggs' Cardiff team in 1893. Although not reselected for the 1891 Championship, Hancock was chosen to represent the first official British Isles team on their first tour of South Africa. Hancock played in all three tests, which all resulted in wins for the tourists. In 1896 a second tour of South Africa was organised. The British Isles were led by Johnny Hammond, and he and Hancock were the only two players to have toured in 1891. Hancock was again chosen to play in all the Tests match, scoring a try in the Second Test at Johannesburg, his only international points. In total Hancock played in 33 matches for the British Isles teams over the two tours, the seven tests and 26 matches against invitational opposition.Philip Hancock personal profile Lionsrugby.com Notes References * Category:1865 births Category:1933 deaths Category:People from Wellington, Somerset Category:English rugby union players Category:England international rugby union players Category:British and Irish Lions rugby union players from England Category:Blackheath F.C. players Category:Barbarian F.C. players ","title":"Froude Hancock"},{"id":"23203784","text":"John Stuart, 12th Earl of Moray (25 January 1797 ‚Äì 8 November 1867), styled The Honourable John Stuart between 1810 and 1859, was a Scottish soldier and politician.

It is under the de facto control of Northern Cyprus. Angastina is perched on a gentle river terrace chalk escarpment over the Pedias river plain at 66 metres above sea level. Etymology The Church of Agios Therapon, Angastina, Cyprus, 2010. Photograph: C.Moisa It was suggested by Nearchos Clerides, in Villages and Cities of Cyprus, that Angastina had been named from the Frank word gastina for crust. This alludes to the thick rocky shell rock (kafkala-Greek Cypriot for crust) that covered the surrounding mesas and on which the last version of the village was built. He suggested that name was modified by the locals and made their own by adding the A. This is possible as the nearby village of Mora was \\"entirely a Frankish town under Frankish occupation. It was owned by the House of Moravit and it was named Mora for short. Cyprus at that time was ruled by the French House of Lusignan.\\" The Franks arrived in Cyprus \\"in the high and late Middle Ages, between 1192 and 1489. However, George Jeffrey speculated that the name (on ancient maps \\"Angestrina \\") may be from \\"neo- latin origin (1500‚Äì1900)\\". Christos Diakos in Angastina - History and Traditions agreed, pointing out that \\"The church of Agios Therapon existed at our village since Byzantine time.Diakosfirst=Christostitle=Angastina-History and Tradition, 1997, pp. 9-10. The name of the village was Agios Therapon. The name Angastina appears at the time of the Venetians. The main church of Angastina up to 1974 was Agia Paraskevi, which has since been converted into a mosque. Whatever is the case, Angastina is renowned for its long history which goes back to prehistoric times. Until 1950 it was on the rail line that connected Famagusta and Nicosia but now on that same carriageway is built a modern motorway. History =Early history= Prehistoric Jug, on display at the Cyprus Museum, Nicosia,. It was dug up at Vouno, Angastina, Cyprus in 1962. Drawing by C. Moisa,2012 Interior of the Church of Agios Therapon, Angastina, Cyprus 2012. Photograph C. Moisa Angastina is renowned for its Cypro-Mycenaean (10,000-800 BC) archaeological burial site of Vouno which was excavated 2 km east of the village in the 1962 when the new road to Famagusta was put through. According to Georgious Kyriakos in Cyprus Heritage, at the Cyprus Museum there are artifacts found in Vouno, such as \\"A Composite vase of White Painted V ware. It consists of four spherical parts joined to a common neck with a pinched mouth. A female figurine is attached to the neck; her right hand holding her breast and the left her abdomen.\\" This dates from the Middle Cypriot III period (1725‚Äì1625 BC). During the Crusades, the village or near it was a fort for the cavalry of the Knight Templars (1291) and locations still bear within living memory such names as The Stables of the Kavalirides (the stables of the cavalry) or The Kavalarides. However Angastina was not always perched over the plains. There are still remnants of an older location of the village, to the south east towards Assia, which are still called Halospita (Ruined Houses). It is thought that either the devastation of The Plague in the 1430s or flooding from the Pedias River forced the original inhabitants to relocate the village to its present location: Latitude 35.204 and Longitude 33.583, about 70 metres above sea level. =The murder of Nikoli Philippou= As many other villages in Cyprus, Angastina, until 1907, was bi- communal. On 17 August of that year a murder occurred that would eventually drive a wedge between the village's Christian and Muslim communities. A young Turk fell in love with a married Greek woman. He was warned off but took it to heart and stupidly fired upon a company of young Greek men very late at night while they were having a coffee in the village square. One the Greek young men suspecting the young Turk took the Police to the young Turk's house. The young Turk confessed and the father offered monetary retribution. The young Greek man refused to be bought off by the father so the young Turk was arrested by the Police. The father was furious that the young Greek man would not accept the money. That night he went with his son inlaw to the threshing field which the young Greek man was guarding with his mother-in-law nearby. The Turkish father murdered him while he was asleep by bashing his head in with a rock. Eventually the Turkish father was arrested and he and his son in law were tried, sentenced and hung by the British authorities of the island. The whole story is recorded in the ballad \\"The murder of Nikoli Philippou\\" by C. T. PalaisiGiagkoulli K.G. Corpus Cypriot Dilalect Poetic Pieces, Centre of Scientific Research, 1998, pp. 76‚Äì79. written at the time and the local press.Elephteria (Newspaper), Nicosia, Cyprus, 16 and 30 November 1997. After that event all Turkish Angastiniotes sold up and moved to nearby Turkish villages. =The Turkish invasion of 1974= Since the Turkish invasion in 1974, the village has been inhabited by Turkish Cypriots and Turkish mainland settlers. Agriculture Angastina is famous for its vineyards and until World War II cotton was grown extensively in the area.General History of Cyprus, Published 185, Alexandria. Wheat, barley and lentils were the main cereals grown before the 1974 Turkish invasion. Famous Angastiniotes Angastina has produced several renowned artists, poets and entrepreneurs.

The catalog is an essential tool of collecting as it provides information about the articles that many times cannot be extracted from them directly, such as the number of banknotes printed. In the 1950s, Robert Friedberg published the Paper Money of the United States. Friedberg devised an organizing number system of all types of U.S. banknotes; the system is widely accepted among collectors and dealers to this day, and the volume has been regularly updated. Another pioneer of cataloging banknotes was Albert Pick, a well-known German notaphilist (born 15 May 1922 in Cologne) who published a number of catalogs of European paper money, and, in 1974, the first Standard Catalog of World Paper Money. His collection of over 180,000 banknotes was eventually housed at the Bavarian Mortgages and Exchange Bank (Bayerischen Hypotheken- und Wechselbank, now HypoVereinsbank). This catalog underwent several incarnations, and currently is published as a three volume group. Volume I, called Specialized Issues, includes notes issued by local authorities, which circulated in a limited area. Volume II called General Issues covers notes issued on a national scope, dated 1368 through 1960. Volume III covers Modern Issues dated 1960 to present. Each of the volumes is updated regularly, with Volume III now updated every year, Volumes I and II every three or so years. From 1994‚Äì2015 George S. Cuhaj was editor, and Pick died in 2015, but the catalogs are still commonly referred to as 'Pick Catalogs' and dealers and collectors alike refer to banknotes by their 'Pick number.'

Origins Barry contacted three musicians with whom he had served in the Army and three local musicians and invited them to join his new band. The first line-up was: Barry (vocals and trumpet), Mike Cox (tenor saxophone), Derek Myers (alto sax), Ken Golder (drums), Fred Kirk (bass guitar), Ken Richards (lead guitar) and Keith Kelly (rhythm guitar). For a short time, the John Barry Seven became John Barry & the Seven when he introduced a vibraphone player, John Aris, but by the time the band began recording for EMI (Parlophone) the experiment had been abandoned. Early years The John Barry Seven (JB7) appeared on British TV shows such as Six-Five Special and Oh Boy! during 1957 and 1958, but discontent began spreading through the band. Jack Good proved to be a hard taskmaster on Oh Boy! Rehearsals were lengthy, intense and arduous to perfect what was a fast-paced show. When compounded by a tough touring schedule and regular recording commitments, morale began to suffer among the band's members. Some resentment towards Barry simmered to the boil, because he did not have to appear when accompanying other artists on the bill. Add the homesickness, caused by travelling, to the list of grievances plus irregular work, meant that the band had arrived back home in Yorkshire, by the time that the London-based Barry was in a position to call them south again for a few more dates. Moreover, they were losing a certain amount of work on Oh Boy! resulting in a substantial reduction in wages. As a consequence, Derek Myers accepted an offer to play with a big band in Scotland. Mike Cox also left; likewise, Fred Kirk (a trained aircraft fitter), after spotting a job in aviation. When Ken Richards announced he wanted to return to Scarborough, Ken Golder felt it was time for him to go too. New line-up Mike Peters and Jimmy Stead (both from Ossett, near Leeds) replaced Kirk and Myers respectively. Peters then introduced the Londoner Dennis King as a replacement for Cox, while Stead brought in Dougie Wright, a drummer with whom he had played in the Leeds-based Bill Marsden Big Band. It meant that with the exception of Barry and Keith Kelly, the original band line-up had disintegrated. Another Leeds lead guitarist, Jack Oliver, lasted a week, before Barry decided to approach Vic Flick, then working with The Bob Cort Skiffle Group. Flick arrived in time to rehearse for an important show at the Metropolitan in Edgware Road on 10 November 1958. The Seven was contracted to perform a 20-minute act as well as backing several other artists, including Marty Wilde. The line-up now read: John Barry (trumpet), Vic Flick (lead guitar), Mike Peters (bass guitar), Keith Kelly (rhythm guitar), Jimmy Stead (baritone sax), Dennis King (tenor sax) and Dougie Wright (drums). For a very short time they experimented with a female singer, Liza Page, the sister of the TV star Jill Day. Drumbeat Drumbeat was created to fill a spot in the BBC's summer schedules, and was intended to threaten the popularity of ITV's Oh Boy! Producer Stewart Morris offered the band an audition with a view to appearing in its own right and also to back a variety of other artists, just as in the early days of Oh Boy! Barry introduced a pianist into the group as a replacement for Keith Kelly, who had decided to try a solo career. Vic Flick suggested his flatmate Les Reed, then playing jazz piano in London night clubs. The new line-up lasted until 1961 when Barry became too busy arranging and composing to continue. He installed Vic Flick as the leader and brought in Bobby Carr on trumpet to take his place. The band enjoyed some success in the UK Singles Chart, as well as appearing regularly on radio and TV and on pop package tours ‚Äì often with Adam Faith. Further changes During 1962, Dougie Wright and Les Reed departed ‚Äì the former in search of more regular work and the latter to forge a career in writing and producing. Dickie Harwood and then Andy White replaced Wright for a short period, while Brian 'Rachmaninoff' Hazelby initially took over from Les Reed, before Kenny Salmon also joined the ensemble. With Barry concentrating on his own future, the band was unable to find the same amount of work, particularly after having severed links with Adam Faith. Also, after \\"The James Bond Theme\\" had peaked at No. 13 in the UK Singles Chart in late 1962, further chart success was proving elusive. Vic Flick had been with the Seven since late 1958 and had led the band on stage for the past two years, but increasing demands on his time as a session player led to his decision to leave. Although he gave three months notice, Barry was unable to find a suitable replacement, thereby forcing him to temporarily disband the group. Flick's last performance as a member of the Seven was at Torquay in August 1963. Final changes By October 1963, after a temporary hiatus, Barry was able to assemble the nucleus of a resurrected JB7 with the assistance of session drummer Bobby Graham. According to Graham, he had been requested by Barry to take over the leadership. Graham had been a member of The Outlaws, Joe Brown and The Bruvvers and Marty Wilde's Wildcats before moving into regular session work. At this point, the band consisted of Graham (drums), Ray Styles (bass guitar), Tony Ashton (keyboards), Ray Russell (lead guitar), Terry Childs (baritone sax), Bob Downes (tenor sax) and Alan Bown (trumpet). After only a few months, Dave Richmond was recruited to replace Styles on bass guitar, while Ron Edgeworth took over from Ashton on keyboards and vocals. In 1964, Graham ‚Äì like Flick and Richmond before him ‚Äì decided to concentrate on ever-increasing studio session work. At that point, Alan Bown took over as leader of the JB7, leaving only him and Terry Childs remaining from the Graham-led band. As soon as he took charge of the JB7, he was keen to book the new line-up into a studio, the result of which was the single \\"24 Hours Ago\\", the first JB7 vocal since Barry's early efforts seven years previously. This recording featured new vocalist and keyboard player Mike O'Neil, and apart from Bown and Childs, the line-up was Dave Green (tenor sax), Stan Haldane (bass guitar), Ernie Cox (drums) and Ron Menicos (lead guitar). The one remaining significant change to the line-up involved Mike O'Neil, who was replaced on keyboards/vocals by Jeff Bannister. Bown admitted to having been disappointed when Barry gave him three months' notice of intent to permanently disband the group. Bown formed the Alan Bown Set, which included Stan Haldane, Jeff Bannister and Dave Green from the remains of the group.

Early life William Parker Snow was born at Poole, England, on 27 November 1817. He was the eldest son of Lieutenant William John Snow (1788‚Äì1827), a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars and War of 1812, and Harriet nee Parker (1802‚Äì1835), a descendant of Oliver Cromwell. After his father's death in 1827, Snow attended the Royal Naval College at Greenwich. In 1833, he was apprenticed to the merchant marine, making his first two voyages to India and later voyages to New South Wales and the Dutch East Indies. Snow also spent a brief period in the Royal Navy on board the Cherokee class brig-sloop HMS Griffon and was one of the prize crew of the slaver Don Francisco captured off Dominica in 1837. Snow married a London housemaid, Sarah Williams, in 1839 and was consequently ostracised by his family. The couple emigrated to Melbourne where they managed a hotel in 1840. Returning prematurely to England due to ill health, an attempt to organise a return to Australia with three other young people including his younger sister and her husband (his wife's brother) failed, and saw him convicted of swindling in 1842 and gaoled for a year. After his release, the Snows became reconciled with his stepfather and they spent some years in Europe, where William Parker Snow worked for some time as librarian at the Baths of Lucca in Tuscany. Here he wrote his first book, a guide to the baths, in 1846. On returning to England, he performed editorial and transcription work for William Johnson Neale and Lord Thomas Babington Macaulay. Siblings A sister, Ellen Susannah Snow, became Mrs John Williams and died late in 1841 or early in 1842, aged about 16. A brother, George Henry Joel Snow (c. 1826‚Äì1904) was also a mariner, but spent his final years as a market gardener in Victoria, Australia. Searching for Sir John Franklin On 7 January 1850, Snow was working as a writer in New York when he claimed to have had a paranormal vision of the whereabouts of the missing Arctic expedition of Sir John Franklin. He immediately wrote to Lady Jane Franklin with a plan for a search. Consequently, she made him the civil officer of her expedition on board the ketch Prince Albert that explored the Boothia Peninsula for any sign of the missing expedition between June and September 1850, without success. On his return, Snow wrote Voyage of the Prince Albert in Search of Sir John Franklin that Lady Franklin used to promote further expeditions. Unable to secure a position on any of the other expeditions then searching for Franklin, late in 1852 the Snows sailed for Melbourne, where he organised a new expedition intending to cross the Pacific and pass eastwards from the Bering Strait. He purchased the 15-ton cutter Thomas in Melbourne for his expedition. Early June 1853, with A. Drummond Fenwick \\"next to himself in command\\" so far as Sydney, his steward and his wife, Snow left Melbourne for Sydney from where, after further alterations were made to the vessel, he sailed for the Arctic on 30 June 1853, accompanied by his wife and a crew of four. Storm damage and problems with his men forced him to enter the Clarence River, New South Wales, a month later, and the expedition was ultimately abandoned. Patagonian mission The Allen Gardiner at Cape Horn in 1855 On his return to England, Snow became master of the Patagonian Missionary Society's schooner Allen Gardiner, which sailed for Keppel Island in the Falkland Islands on 24 October 1854. His most important achievement was discovering the location of the Tierra del Fuego native Jemmy Button in November 1855. Disagreements with the society's management saw him sacked by the newly arrived missionary George Pakenham Despard in September 1856. In the aftermath, his wife suffered a nervous breakdown from which she never recovered. Snow published a successful book A Two Years' Cruise off Tierra del Fuego, the Falkland Islands, Patagonia and in the River Plate: A Narrative of Life in the Southern Seas in 1857 but ultimately lost a lengthy legal case for compensation for wrongful dismissal against his former employers. He correctly predicted that the society's method of operation would result in a massacre by the natives (see South_American_Mission_Society#The_Wulaia_Massacre). He became reconciled with his former employer's successor, the South American Missionary Society, in the mid-1880s. Aborted searches for the Franklin Expedition In 1857, Lady Franklin employed Snow as a travelling lecturer in support of her expedition using the auxiliary steamship Fox, which returned with confirmation of the tragic fate of the missing expedition in 1859. Snow immediately promoted a new expedition seeking the lost expedition's scientific records that were believed to have been buried under a cairn or in Sir John Franklin's grave. He acquired a small schooner, Triumver, which he renamed Endeavour, but a series of delays, ill-health and inadequate funds saw the expedition abandoned early in 1862, before it could leave Liverpool. Snow then proposed another overland expedition from Canada and travelled to New York, where he was soon in contact with Charles Francis Hall, who had been exploring the Canadian Arctic in much the way Snow had earlier planned. They planned another expedition while Snow edited Hall's account of his expedition, Arctic Researches and Life Amongst the Esquimaux, for the publishers Harper Brothers. Lack of finances and disagreements between the two men saw their expedition with its own 95-ton schooner Active aborted, and Hall left with a small, land- based expedition on the whaler Monticello in July 1864. Snow remained in New York writing and lecturing. Snow had presented an interesting relic to be interred in President Abraham Lincoln's coffin. In the 26 April 1865 New York Herald Page 1 Column 4, was the following article: \\"Captain Parker Snow, the distinguished commander of the Arctic and Antarctic exploring expeditions, presented to Gen. Dix, with a view of their being interred in the coffin of the President, some interesting relics of Sir John Franklin's ill fated expedition. They consisted of a tattered leaf of a Prayer Book, on which the first word legible was the word \\"Martyr,\\" and a piece of fringe and some portions of uniform. These suggestive relics, which are soon to be buried out of sight, were found in a boat lying under the head of a human skeleton.\\" Literary career While living in New York, Snow compiled his most successful book, on the military leaders of the Confederate States of America, first published as Southern Generals, Who They Are, and What They Have Done in 1864, being reprinted in at least two revised editions with slightly varying titles including Southern Generals, Their Lives and Campaigns (1866) and Lee and his Generals. Returning to England in 1867, Snow continued writing and publishing on diverse subjects until almost the day he died. His efforts met with mixed success and the last two decades of his life were spent in genteel poverty, aided by a small pension and donations from friends. He died at London on 12 March 1895, his Polar Medal being placed on his grave. Snow was a complex person ‚Äì quick to take offence in the face of authority, litigious and prone to paranoia. These characteristics led to the failure of many of his projects. However, to many observers he genuinely tried to do good for others, often causing himself legal and financial distress. He supported many good causes, including services to the poor in London and marine safety, including the efforts of Samuel Plimsoll and proposals for harbours of refuge and a system of linked floating relief stations around the globe. Though describing himself as a conservative, he publicly supported many radical causes including that of the Tichborne Claimant, Arthur Orton. His writings, preserved in several public collections including the Royal Geographical Society (London) and Mitchell Library (Sydney), include many valuable observations, especially on the native peoples of Australia, the Arctic and Patagonia.

Reports of footprints, video, and hair samples have been documented by enthusiasts. Mainstream biologists remain skeptical to the existence of such a creature. Mogollon Monster Wood Carving  Description  = Physical characteristics = The Mogollon Monster is reported to be a bipedal humanoid, over 7 feet tall, with inhuman strength, and large eyes that some claim to be \\"wild and red\\". Its body is said to be covered with long black or reddish brown hair, with the exclusion of the chest, face, hands and feet. Reports claim it has a strong and pungent odor described as that of \\"dead fish, a skunk with bad body odor, decaying peat moss and the musk of a snapping turtle\\". = Behavior = Stories say the creature is nocturnal, omnivorous, very territorial and sometimes very violent. It is generally reported to: walk with wide, inhuman strides; leave behind footprints measuring 22 inches in length; mimic birds, coyotes and other wildlife; emit unusual whistle sounds; explore campsites after dark; build \\"nests\\" out of pine needles, twigs, and leaves; and hurl stones from locations that are hidden from view. The creature has also been said to decapitate deer and other wildlife prior to consumption. In numerous reports, the monster has been said to emit a \\"blood-curdling\\" scream; described as sounding like a woman in \\"great distress\\". Accounts of the creature regularly describe an \\"eerie silence prior to the encounter, an appreciable stillness in the woods that commonly surrounds predatory animals.\\"  Reported sightings  The majority of Mogollon Monster sightings are said to occur in the Ponderosa pine forests of the Mogollon Rim. Heber, Arizona Reported sightings range along Arizona's Mogollon Rim, from Prescott north to Williams, southeast to Alpine, south to Clifton, and northwest back to Prescott. *The oldest known documented sighting of the Mogollon Monster was reported in a 1903 edition of The Arizona Republican, in which I.W. Stevens described a creature seen near the Grand Canyon as having \\"long white hair and matted beard that reached to his knees. It wore no clothing, and upon his talon-like fingers were claws at least two inches long.\\" Upon further inspection he noted \\"a coat of gray hair nearly covered his body, with here and there a spot of dirty skin showing.\\" He later stated that after he discovered the creature drinking the blood of two cougars, it threatened him with a club, and \\"screamed the wildest, most unearthly screech\\". *Another early documented sighting was recounted by cryptozoologist Don Davis. During the mid-1940s he was on a Boy Scout trip near Payson, Arizona, of which he gave the following account: \\"The creature was huge. Its eyes were deep set and hard to see, but they seemed expressionless. His face seemed pretty much devoid of hair, but there seemed to be hair along the sides of his face. His chest, shoulders, and arms were massive, especially the upper arms; easily upwards of 6 inches in diameter, perhaps much, much more. I could see he was pretty hairy, but didn't observe really how thick the body hair was. The face/head was very square; square sides and squared up chin, like a box\\". *Marjorie Grimes, a Whiteriver, Arizona resident, claimed to have sighted the creature a number of times between 1982 and 2004. She described the creature as black, tall, and walking in big strides. A number of people on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation also claimed to have seen the creature.  Scientific opinions  Professor emeritus of biology, Stan Lindstedt, of Northern Arizona University, dismisses the idea that a large humanoid creature would remain hidden in such a large area of the country. \\"I put that in the category of mythology that can certainly make our culture interesting, but has nothing to do with science.\\" Generally the scientific community attributes creature sightings to either hoaxes or misidentification. As recently as the early 1930s, grizzly bears roamed the forests of Arizona. These may account for the early day sightings while other large mammals such as black bears, mountain lions and elk may account for the sightings of today.  Appearances in local legend  *The Mogollon Monster has become an object of local campfire stories. One such story, told by Boy Scouts, involves Arizona pioneer, Sam Spade, building a log cabin on land adjacent to what is now Camp Geronimo, only to be attacked by the creature, and is mentally broken for the rest of his life. Later his son Bill Spade and his soon to be wedded wife are killed by the creature on their wedding day. The monster is said to still remain in the area, looking for its next victim. Other stories explain the origins of the Mogollon Monster implicating a tormented Indian bent on revenge, or an Indian chief transforming to scare away his former clan. Another story involves a pioneer who is attacked by Indians, escapes, but is cursed by the spirits and goes insane. Still another story describes the creature as the \\"phantom of a white man who, as punishment for murdering an Indian woman, was hung from a tree by his hands, stretched to a height of eight feet, then skinned alive and left to die. Damned by the spirits, his ghost continues to roam the woods as the tragically misnamed \\"Skinwalker\\"\\".  Media  The Mogollon Monster is a topic in folklore collections, guides on \\"local color\\", and works of fiction, including the following: * *\\"Weird Arizona: Your Travel Guide to Arizona's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets\\". Sterling Publishing. 2007. . The myth also lives on musically in the work of Dolan Ellis (Arizona's Official State Balladeer since 1966). Years ago, Dolan used a song named \\"Mongollon Monster\\" in a campaign against littering, especially in the wilderness areas of Arizona, claiming that the monster targeted those who carelessly littered in its territory.

Birendra Krishna Bhadra Birendra Krishna Bhadra, who will always be remembered for making Mahalaya memorable to one and all, is the voice behind the ‚ÄúMahisasura Mardini.‚Äù He recites the holy verses and tells the story of the descent of Durga to earth. It was on the day of Mahalaya, the beginning of \\"Devipaksha\\", that the gods and goddesses woke up to prepare themselves for Durga Puja. In 1931, Mahalaya was first broadcast over the radio in Akashvani, Calcutta. The programme was organised by Pankaj Kumar Mallik, Premankur Aatorthi, Birendra Krishna Bhadra, Nripendra Krishna Mukhopadhyay and Raichand Boral. So popular was his version of the recitation that when in 1976, the voice of noted Bengali actor, Uttam Kumar was employed for the programme and renamed it as Durga Durgatiharini did not get favorable response from the audience and it was shifted back to the original version of Birendra Krishna Bhadra.Timeless Tunes Indian Express, Sep 29, 2008. Bhadra died long ago, but his recorded voice still forms the core of the Mahalaya program. In a sonorous voice Bhadra renders the Mahalaya recital for one and half thrilling hours, mesmerizing every household with the divine aura of his narration, as the Bengalees submerge their souls in quiet moments of prayer. Musical Composition Though the theme is mythological and the mantras Vedic, this program is a landmark composition. It is scripted by Bani Kumar, and narrated by Birendra Krishna Bhadra while Dwijen Mukhopadhyay (Jago Durga Jago Doshoprohoronodharini), Manabendra Mukhopadhyay (Tabo Achinta), Sandhya Mukhopadhyay, Arati Mukhopadhyay, Utpala Sen, Shyamal Mitra and Supriti Ghosh (Bajlo tomar alor benu) sang in their melodious voices. The enchanting music is composed by Pankaj Mullick,. As the recital begins, the serene morning air resonates with the long drawn sound of the sacred conch shell, followed by a tune in Raga Malkosh, which ultimately leads to the start of the programme with the prayer to Goddess Chandi. Immediately an atmosphere is created full of assurance, respect and universal love and peace. This way, Mahisasurmardini took a permanent place in the heart of Bengali as well as Indian culture. =Artists= Main Artists * Bani Kumar - Script Writing * Pankaj Mullick - Music Composition * Birendra Krishna Bhadra - Narration and Recitation of Scriptures Singers * Dwijen Mukhopadhyay (Jago Tumi Jago, Jago Durga, Jago Dashoprohoronadharini) * Pratima Bandopadhyay (Amala Kirane) * Shyamal Mitra (Subhro Sankha Robe) * Sandhya Mukhopadhyay (Bimane Bimane Aloker Gaane) * Manabendra Mukhopadhyay (Tabo Achintya) * Arati Mukhopadhyay (Subhro Sankha Robe) * Supriti Ghosh (Bajlo Tomar Alor Benu) * Pankaj Kumar Mullick (Jayanti Mangala Kali & Aham Rudrebhirvasubhischara) * Utpala Sen (Shanti Dile Bhori) * Tarun Bandopadhyay (Hey Chinmoyi) * Krishna Dasgupta (Akhilo Bimane Tabo Jayagaane) * Sumitra Sen (Mago Tabo Bine) * Ashima Bhattacharya (Subhro Sankha Robe) * Shipra Bose (Ogo amar agomoni) * Bimal Bhushan (Namo Chandi Namo Chandi) * Dhananjay Bhattacharya (Rupang Dehi, Jayang Dehi) * Haimanti Shukla (Aham Rudrebhirvasubhischara, Jago Dashoprohoronadharini) References * Pragya Paramita. \\"Heralding The Goddess\\", expressindia.com, Indian Express Newspapers (Mumbai) Ltd, 15 September 2006.

The Mixteca  In 1906 the French scientist Leon Diguet published in Paris the following about La Mixteca:Contribution a l'Etude geographique du mexique pr√©colombien. \\"Le Mixtecapan\\" :The mountainous and hilly region which is the Mixtec Indians' country formed, after the Spaniards' establishment, La Mixteca province, was designated by the Nahuas with the Mixtecapan name, a word derived from the Nahuatl word Mixtlan (cloudy or foggy land), made up term by Mixtli (cloud) and the suffix tlan, locative, place. This name would have been given to the country because the cold weather frequently prevails over the elevated regions of the High Mixteca Mountains. :This territory includes the current geographical division, an important Oaxaca State part and a fraction of the States of Puebla and Guerrero. :The Mixtec name given to this country before the conquest is unknown, we only know by Father Antonio de los Reyes, missionary who settled in Teposcolula around 1593. A Mixtec grammar author, the Mixtecs were named Mixtoquijxi (wild cats) by their neighbors the Zapotecs, designation probably ironic and coming from the roughness of the places that these Indians had chosen to settle.  Achiutla  The Achiutla's man. Pre-Columbian piece. San Juan Achiutla. Leon Diguet also made historiography on Achiutla: :Two locations are identified as being the Mixtec country colonization focal point: Apoala and Achiutla. These settlements have grown and flourished as urban centres which although now reduced to simple towns, before the European conquest were flourishing cities. :Achiutla or Achutla (Achioztlan) is represented today - wrote Diguet 1906- by two towns located a short distance one from another San Juan Achiutla and San Miguel Achiutla, in that the total population barely reaches 1,800 individuals. The average altitude taken between the two populations is .more accurate current measurement: 1992 m The ancient city of Achiutla was north of the town of San Miguel, on the plateau where today the Church stands.The Church mentioned by Diguet belongs to the San Miguel convent which included a great dimensions walled garden. It is on the pre-Columbian temple platform, perhaps the main, and in front, used as cemetery which prevents appreciate what actually is, different levels and boards of another pyramid of huge dimensions of the same time, waiting for their study and restoration. :Before the conquest the population likely reached 14,000 inhabitants, but it significantly reduced following a \\"mazahuatl\\" Diguet text says mazahuatl, the correct way is matlazahualtl: epidemic that could be typhus, plague, hemorrhagic fever or smallpox brought this last by the Spaniards. At that time there wasn‚Äôt an accurate diagnosis. Achiutla never recovered its population the size that had in ancient times. epidemic. :Established in the High Mixteca center, Achiutla was the chief who ruled the Mixt√©capan residence. After the schism that divided the country into three principalities, this city was the spiritual center or the Taysacca or religious leader residence. The temple was famous, they came from everywhere to worship a deity considered to be a Quetzalcoatl personification. It was represented by a large dimension emerald on which were carved a bird and a snake. This jewel excited the Spaniards admiration by the job perfection. It was destroyed by the missionaries as described below. Stone Axe, obsidian arrowheads and malacate winch were found in San Juan Achiutla. :On the old city edge opens a cave the entrance suggest a tunnel that connects with the town of San Juan and for which, in times of war it could go from one to another. :The Achiutla Nahuatl name seems to come from this cave. Deconstructing it is in effect: achio means frequent, oztli, cave, tlan, locality or place: place of the cave frequented. Another possible etymology is as follows: Atl water, chipimi dripping, otli road, tlan locality or place: site were the roads oozing water.There are other Achiutla's meaning versions: a \\"cave which drips water\\" which is effectively linked with meanings explained by Diguet. Another \\"Where achiote (Bixa Orellana) is abundant\\", but achiote grows in tropical regions, between above sea level and this plant does not support the frosts, whereas Achiutla had 1,992 and freezes in winter. As condiment is not usually in the High Mixteca; in pre-colonial times was used to get the red color for codex and other pigmentation, but its use to that effect was low; that is why it is completely doubtful the achiote was copious in Achiutla, . :For the Mixtec name, Sundecu or Sundico Mixtec, nunu village, and dico pulverized made dust. This name would have been given to the city because the revered Emerald would have been reduced to dust by the missionaries. :Achiutla's geographical location splendor and religious importance are probably the causes have done, so to consider as the Mixtec nation origin place. Although nowadays the information doesn‚Äôt exist can prove their priority over Apoala. Jansen and P√©rez Jim√©nez refer to Achiutla in their Paisajes Sagrados: c√≥dices y arqueolog√≠a de √ëuu Dzaui as follows: :In the Codex A√±ute (Selden), p. 6-III, we see how the 6 Monkey Princess embarks on a journey underground. Apparently starts from an opening in the rock wall over a river, where it is venerated the El Coraz√≥n del Pueblo de la lluvia jewel (The rain people‚Äôs heart, √ëuu Dzaui, the Mixtec people); probably it is the cave √ëuu Ndecu (Achiutla) where the El Coraz√≥n del Pueblo packaging (1934 Burgoa, I: 319, 332-333) was preserved. The Princess began with asking for permission to √ëuhu, probably the entrance guardian to the underground hall: named Hueso-Coa, Yeque Yata, can decipher as \\"bone (yeque) before (yata)\\". Dzahui Pre-Columbian rain's deity is formed in raindrops, found in San Juan Achiutla. For its part Manuel A. Hermann Lejarazu explains in his work on the Codex Yucunama: :Focus on the High Mixteca area, the most mountainous and elevated √ëuu Dzaui part. In the pre-colonial era flourished here the √ëuu Tnoo (Tilantongo), Chiyo Cahnu (Teozacualco), √ëuu Ndaya (Chalcatongo), Ndisi Nuu (Tlaxiaco) and √ëuu Ndecu (Achiutla) kingdoms, among others. :The Sun and Venus gods threw darts from the sky with which drilled the big hill precious the place of sand. One of his darts fertilized the Earth and thus was born the first lineage ancestor. The Primordial Lord's granddaughter, married a prince, who was born from a big tree in the City on Flames, √ëuu Ndecu, the current Achiutla. :Achiutla, as is at the present known √ëuu Ndecu (\\"Burning City\\"), was in ancient times the High Mixteca spiritual center, the: :\\"This nation [Mixtec] Great Temple, where all its resolutions for peace and wars had his consultations Oracle [...];\\" \\"they came from other distant provinces to ask favour and ask him in his works, doubts and what must be done\\". The pre- Hispanic settlement was largest and most important: more than four thousand families lived in their beautiful valleys next to rivers, occupying in the work of the field, \\"and so they are not neglect, had indicated as criers, official elected for a year, so that every morning at the first light, uploaded on top of the House of his Republic\\"\\"with great shouts, they rang and excitasen all, saying: come out, come out to work, to work\\" (Burgoa, 1934b I: chaps. 23-26). :With qualifying √ëuu Ndecu as the Great Temple in √ëuu Dzaui - Mixtec nation-, chroniclers makes an implicit comparison with the Aztecs famous largest temple in their capital, Mexico-Tenochtitlan. Even today stands the old pyramid silhouette, a kind of Acropolis, which tradition referred to as the Sun Temple. All this is as we said, on a hill with promontory between rivers(which run north to South). On the Western side, the river Los Sabinos passes; on the eastern side the Yute Uha, \\"Salt River\\", and Yute Ita, \\"Flowers River\\" passes. At the foot of the convent's promontory, these streams come together and form the Yute Ndaa, \\"Extended River \\" or \\"Blue River\\". :The oral tradition of the place holds that √ëuu Ndecu valley was formerly a large lagoon, which barely lifted the promontory and the Siki Tinduu. It is the primordial lake concept, which like the darkness is a metaphor for the area which we see today the world's creation. Negrito Stone, Mixtec household utensil used from pre-Columbian times to the 20th century first half, to insert into the center firewood and light in the dark to do chores like grinding nixtamal early in the morning. Basalt. Diameter , height . San Juan Achiutla :The two priests led stones of power - the Rain's God stone and the Lizard stone--to the Yuta Tnoho sanctuary (Apoala), where they received blessings and instructions from the 9 Lizard Lady, who reigned there (Codex A√±ute, p. 1-III). We notice in passing the conceptual overlap between this lizard stone and the lizard relief in a building early Huamelulpan. √ëuu Ndecu (Achiutla), the priests placed these stones next to the primary lagoon at the great Ceiba foot, made their prayers spread her blood on paper and offered ground ‚Äúpiciete‚Äù. Then, the tree was opened and gave birth to the ancestor founder, Lord 2 Grass \\"Deceased which manifests as a Feathered Serpent\\". Six brothers, probably six noble A√±ute families (Jaltepec) ancestors followed him. I.e., this origin story tells us about a group of seven men who were born from the √ëuu Ndecu tree, the principal of which was the dynasty ruler (yaa tnuhu iya toni√±e) founder. In this regard, Jansen and P√©rez Jim√©nez, also depict: :By this magic and religious act grew in that place the Origin Great Tree, which lifted and holds the sky. It was the ‚ÄúTree of the Eye‚Äù, Yutnu Nuu, a ceiba or a pochote, surrounded by snakes of fog and darkness, that is to say by mysterious and impressive superhuman powers. They were offered to him - placed in basket and j√≠cara (a vegetal and natural bowl) - jade and gold, wealth in abundance -the eagle and the fire serpent - power to transform and fly into trance, as a ball of fire - as well as the hand with the knife and the rope - civilian authority. :With him were born: the Lord 1 Eagle, Water; the Lord 3 Water, Maguey; the Lord 5 Deer, Turkey; the Lord 5 Movement, Quail; the Lord 5 Lizard, Rain, and the Lord 5 Eagle, Rain. They were the primary founders and owners, which gave life to the region. They were the first Nuuddzahui (Mixtec). The god Dzahui consecrate a Mixtec ruler by pouring over him with his jug (Nutall Codex, page 5, back). Hermann Lejarazu continues: :The √ëuu Ndecu important position as the spiritual center of √ëuu Dzaui and kernel of his liturgical and political life in the pre-colonial era is also expressed in the main deity worshipped name here. The main sanctuary was at the highest mountain summit, where the high priest gave worship to the Sacred Wrapper called The People's Heart. Wrapped in precious fabrics was an ancient jade stone in a large chili pepper size, sculpted in a bird, and a coiled snake form. In other worlds, a Feathered Serpent picture the Mesoamerica divine power, known as Quetzalcoatl in Nahuatl. The People's Heart - say Burgoa - represented the Mixtec people lineage founder: :Making sacrifices and worshiped its first founder said he was the People¬¥s Heart and kept it in a safe place and sacrificed to it valuables things as gold and precious stones. Front of the Heart always burned wood, where they burned copal or incense too. :This People's Heart also appears in the √ëuu Dzaui pictorial manuscripts, specifically in the Codex A√±ute (Selden), page 6-III, where it is painted as a precious stone with \\" The People of the Rain Heart\\" name (Ini √ëuu Dzavui), in other words, \\"The Mixtec People‚Äôs Heart‚Äù. It is situated in a large cave on top of a river. √ëuu Ndecu path to and site, the City in Flames, Achiutla, colonial and pre-Columbian archaeological site P√©rez Ortiz quotes the historian and Dominican Francisco de Burgoa's description made about this piece in 1674, more than one hundred years after its destruction: ::‚Ä¶and between their infamous altars, they had one devoted to an idol, called The People¬¥s Heart, that was great veneration object, and a greatly appreciated matter, because it was an emerald as large as a big chili pepper from this earth, had carved above a little bird, with great gracefulness, and top to bottom coiled a little snake did with the same art, the stone was transparent. It shined from the bottom, where it seemed like a candle burning flame; it was a very ancient jewel, that there was no memory of the commencement of its worship and adoration .: :These historical references--continues Lejarazu - aren't sufficient to identify The People‚Äôs Heart worship exact place, nor their accurate relationship with the Achiutla‚Äôs Oracle. It is clear the river represents the √ëuu Ndecu deep valley. It appears in the 15th century, Achiutla was conquered by the Aztecs, who destroyed and burned their main temple, in 1462 the temple and the city suffered the fire, to this fact is due to carry the Mixtec name of √ëuu Nducu in one of their etymologies meaning burned town or city in flames. Achiutla, √ëuu Ndecu, is waiting for its historical and archaeological recovery, relevant to the Mixtec culture, the State of Oaxaca and Mexico; as well as claim linguistic and ethnic indigenous, of the Mixtec Indian, object sometimes of denial, rejection and self-destruction of the maternal ethnic, language and culture, effects of colonialism and racism, to supplant the dignity and wealth that involve to belong to this ancient culture, even alive.

Colonial period When in the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, took news of Hern√°n Cort√©s and his troops arrival to Veracruz - concerns Alfonso P√©rez Ortiz citing Jos√© Antonio Gay ‚Äì Moctecuhzoma (Moctezuma) sent an embassy with some gifts for \\"The People‚Äôs Heart\\" deity and consult the Oracle \\"to know the fate that was reserved for his people\\", the √ëuu Ndecu \\"Pontiff\\" came to the shrine and \\"The people that had been left to the party from outside\\"\\", they heard between confusing noise of voices\\" the fateful announcement that \\"the Moctezuma lordship is over...¬®.\\" The Lord 2 Vulture, Snake of Fire-Sun and Mrs. 13 House, Flower of Bat, ruled √ëuu Ndecu when in the Land of the Rain, were known these dire first news concerning the Spaniards. From 1522 to 1528 Achiutla, what would be San Miguel and San Juan, was subjected unduly by the conquer Mart√≠n V√°zquez who would be prosecuted for mistreating and threatening death to the people's chiefs by not delivering extraordinary tributes and pretended to be the legitimate encomendero. In 1528 Achiutla became part Francisco Maldonado's encomienda its real owner, √ëuu Ndecu contributed to him 48 gold dust \\"tejuelos\\". In 1550 his encomienda and \\"Achiotla\\" (Achutla) passed to do√±a Isabel Roxas (Rojas) his wife. In 1555 the viceroy don Luis de Velasco ordered to allow entering Santo Domingo religious order to Achiutla, since the encomendero's cleric of the place prevented. The Dominicans settled finally in 1557 in √ëuu Ndecu founded their community, at the time they would build the \\"doctrine-convent\\". Explosion chamber. In a large number were used in San Juan Achiutla from the colony until the early 20th century rather than rockets, it was filled with gunpowder and detonated by the hole in the side. Iron. 10 cm high, 4.5 cm wide at the base. Among the Dominican religious who came to Achiutla was Fray Benito Hern√°ndez who wrote his Christian catechism written in Mixtec,Fray Benito Hern√°ndez took the Dominican order habit in the San Esteban convent in Salamanca. Reached Mexico by Fray Vicente de las Casas. So they went to the Mixtec region where he learned the Mixtec language in a short time. He was sent to evangelize Achiutla because the father who was there didn‚Äôt know the language and therefore had not achieved good communication with the place inhabitants. Friar hadn‚Äôt a good reception and the people abandoned him almost to death by starvation, cause he intended to put end to the idolatry and destroyed the Chalcatongo's graveyard, situated in one La Mixteca highest hills. His Christian doctrine in Mixtec language was an attempt to understand indigenous people and teach them the new faith. Unfortunately, the single original in the world which is incomplete in the Burgoa Library in Oaxaca, lacks front cover and colophon. The work is written in the Teposcolula‚Äôs Mixtec variant. and to whom is attributed the evangelization of the Mixtecs of √ëuu Ndecu; people that continued practicing their ancient religious customs in a hidden form in the caves and hills close to the place making worship to \\"The People‚Äôs Heart\\" deity . Fray Benito heard about the existence of this image and rose to the summit in question, where destroyed the ceremonial center. ::‚Ä¶an immensity of several figures of idols, which were in niches, on stones stained foolishly of human blood and smoke of incense which sacrificed them. (Burgoa) And he got done in The People's Heart‚Äù deity. ::‚Ä¶and have a solemn day prevented, and together many towns, pulled the stone and he broke it with great difficulty, through instruments, because its hardness, sent grind it into powder there [‚Ä¶] and mixed with ground, he threw and stepped on, in front of the eyes of a huge crowd that attended the event, and then made them a big sermon‚Ä¶(Burgoa) So the pulverizing of this jewel, would be a little after 1557 (P√©rez Ortiz, 2009). 1580 There were few Spaniard settlers in the Mixtec communities in the mountains, because they avoided visit them for fear of its inhabitants. In 1584 San Juan Achiutla land titles were issued by the colonial government, that in 1748 issued communal titles. From this last period, the San Juan Evangelista's Church in San Juan Achiutla retains the following historical trail: an oil painting approximately 1.4 for 1.2 m whose lower part said \\"Don Juan Ortiz and his wife do√±a Mar√≠a Daniel devotion year 1749\\". The work has several levels; the top appears the Holy Trinity, in the central part an Archangel, then Saint Dominic and St. Francis of Assisi. At the next level the purgatory image: a man with the papal tiara, another with the bishop tiara, one cleric, a woman and a man, all burn between the flames; below represents a solemn mass attended by men on the right and women on the left. On the deteriorated work lower place we can read: \\"F. Garc√≠a Ruiz and Jos√© Isidro Ruiz, Jos√© de la Luz...\\", and more illegible words in red. It could be inferred that at that time there was sufficient financial capacity of some people as to order to do oil paintings possibly out of the town, probably in the San Miguel convent or Teposcolula, make solemn Eucharistic celebrations, and the existence of sufficient population and economic activity could be inferred to generate at least medium-sized wealth. The colonial period, the 19th century and the Mexican Revolution at San Juan Achiutla are pending of being researched and counted. At this point we know that in: * 1825, San Juan Achutla Nusu√±e (it was its name then) was part of the constituency of the called Partido Partido in this case means, according to the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language Dictionary: district or territory of jurisdiction or body that has a main town per head de Tlaxiaco. * 1844 was a village of the Achutla's Partido, sub-prefecture of Tlaxiaco, Teposcolula district. * 1858 again belonged to the Tlaxiaco's District. * 1891 was a municipality in the Tlaxiaco's District.  Contemporary period  San Juan Achiutla has no municipal archive so it is virtually impossible to do an history based on the documentary source. If we compare with people, we could say that the municipality works verbally; it would seem that municipality is in illiteracy in the absence of documentary collections. 1945, a peasant and his \\"jacal\\", a rural house mainly used at that time in San Juan Achiutla. 1945, family from San Juan Achiutla 1945, peasant of San Juan Achiutla with usual clothing at that time. 1945, Teodoro Trujillo, countryman of San Juan Achiutla 1948, San Juan Achiutla inhabitants, the young man with the deer was Jes√∫s A.

Un testimonio y documentos para la microhistoria de San Juan Achiutla y la Mixteca Alta en el estado de Oaxaca Ra√∫l Ruiz Bautista memoirs. Partially this book without being or pretending to be a site history, came to partially remedy the documents absence about San Juan Achiutla. For it we can retrieve some people and town events after the Mexican Revolution until 21st century first decade. San Juan history and the road Ixtapa - Tlacotepec construction are inseparable, Ra√∫l Ruiz Bautista released his proclamation for their construction and San Juan Achiutla led the project and this road construction with Rutilio Ruiz Hern√°ndez to the head. The following are the relevant facts from the 20th century. 1920 * In the decade beginning in 1920, due to resources scarcity for families livelihood in San Juan Achiutla, peasants migrated to R√≠o Blanco, Orizaba, C√≥rdoba, Potrero Viejo, Santa Rosa and other places in Veracruz State, Mexico, to find work in the field and in factories, they got job in fabrics and yarns factories and Cervecer√≠a Moctezuma, brewery, or in the field collecting coffee, cutting cane or other agricultural work. Returning to the village especially to be on December 27 at the town's feast. Many of them were rooted in those populations for many years, some permanently. * In 1929 it was built and established the first primary school where taught the teacher Rutilio Ruiz Hern√°ndez. One of the homes the school occupied was the premise and building called \\"La sala\\" owned by Bartolo Ruiz, who provided it for that purpose. This building no longer exists. 1930 * In 1935 the elementary school was converted into Rural Federal School Francisco I. Madero, being substituted Rutilio Ruiz Hern√°ndez as teacher by the professor Pedro Hern√°ndez, graduated from the Normal Rural School. At school existed only until the fourth grade. * In 1936 the young Eliseo Ruiz L√≥pez was carried by her father Tranquilino Ruiz to Normal Rural School of Cuilapan, near Oaxaca City to study for rural teacher, being the first to come out of San Juan Achiutla to study. So the San Juan Achiutla's Mayor, in an arbitrary way, decided to imprison and submit to penal labour Tranqulino his father with the claim that the boy did not was lose to the Catholic faith and return to the village to serve the municipality and to abandon his studies, which failed. * In 1938 Ra√∫l Ruiz Bautista and Natalio Ram√≠rez P√©rez left the town with the same goal, they were followed by many young people who would be teachers and professionals, employees in other parts of the country or in the United States of America. 1940 * On October 17, 1942 the municipality of San Juan Achiutla was established by presidential resolution. * On October 28, 1942 the communal property of the community of San Juan Achiutla, of the San Juan Achiutla municipality, were titled by presidential resolution published in the Official Gazette of the Federation on March 3, 1943. * The Municipal Palace was built in 1947 being Mayor Mr. Teodoro Jos√©. * In August 1949 from San Juan Achiutla Ra√∫l Ruiz Bautista launched its Road Manifesto calling for the towns of the region to the road San Felipe Ixtapa - San Agust√≠n Tlacotepec construction in order to get out of backwardness, poverty and the isolation deprived High Mixteca towns. The Manifesto was endorsed by don Rutilio Ruiz Hern√°ndez, who became the leader and road construction organizer in the region while Raul Ruiz would be the negotiator of financial resources and contact with authorities, organizations and politicians in the country's capital, both during the fifteen years that would last its construction. * The Regional Committee For the Ixtapa ‚Äì Tlacotepec Road was founded in 1949; it organized the towns of this route during the entire period that lasted its construction, Rutilio Ruiz Hern√°ndez was named Chairman of this committee. * On October 15, 1949 the San Jos√© de Gracia authorities adhere to the Manifesto, the other towns of the route, Santo Tom√°s Tecolotitl√°n, Santa Mar√≠a Ndoayaco, San Sebasti√°n Atoyaquillo, Santo Domingo Huend√≠o and San Agust√≠n Tlacotepec also would in due course, providing and at times to deny their collaboration for the construction. At the beginning, the work of the people was loaned free of charge as required by the Mexican Federal Government in their conventions, which provided one-third of its funding. After the first five years in which people worked for free, the workers were paid, though sparsely. * In December 1949 were sent letters to the Roads National Committee General Secretary Jos√© Rivera R. To ask resources for the road's construction and in the same month to the Communications and Transport Secretary Lic. Agust√≠n Garc√≠a L√≥pez. 1950 * In 1950 at the request of Rutilio Ruiz Hern√°ndez from San Juan Achiutla, Chairman of the Regional Committee For the Ixtapa ‚Äì Tlacotepec Road, several towns sent to the President of the Republic, Miguel Alem√°n Vald√©s, written to requesting resources for the road, neither the National Committee or the Secretariat of Communications had responded. * In that same year Rutilio Ruiz Hern√°ndez was appointed general organizer of the Indigenous Congress in the Mixtec region. * In January 1951 the Regional Committee For the Ixtapa ‚Äì Tlacotepec Road requests the Oaxaca State Governor financial resources and his influence before the Federal Government to obtain it. Not importing applications repeated during the construction of the road, never received a satisfactory response from the Government of Oaxaca, only contributed with an amount equivalent to less than half a kilometre, its attention to the project was sent the requests for resources \\"to the corresponding area\\" where fell into a vacuum. * 1951 San Juan Achiutla and the Mixtec Region were represented by Ra√∫l Ruiz Bautista in the Second National Congress of the Confederation of Indigenous Young People in Mexico City. It was a Congress to try to incorporate indigenous organizations for purely political purposes, as reported Ra√∫l recommending not participates in such organization. * The Regional Committee of Indigenous Youth and Communities was founded in may, 1951 in San Juan Achiutla and designating San Juan Achiutla as the official seat of the Mixtec Regional Congress in the same year. * On May 23, 1951 the Communications and Public Works Ministry orders the layout of the road but directs to the last section, the Huend√≠o - Tlacotepec is not done: \\"still important not to carry out the last segment with Tlacotepec, pursuant to the expressed desire of does not arise on the short road, the vehicles in the region of Chalcatongo and trying to have as a forced via the Tlaxiaco City.\\" (Note No. 324-RGB-1947, dossier 441.2 [727.2] / 5-1 folio 15362 signed by Manuel L√≥pez sailing from Secretary of Communications an Public Works, to keep traffic on the long road, by Tlaxiaco, the path would be a long alley without exit, without connection to Yosond√∫a and Chalcatongo. * In April 1951 the Regional Committee For the Ixtapa ‚Äì Tlacotepec Road joins to the Coalition of Mixtec ‚Äì Oaxacan Towns directed by Dr. Manuel Hern√°ndez Hern√°ndez, one of the major characters who due to his political position - Federal Deputy - help obtaining federal funds for the construction of the road. * On October 6, 1951 was received in San Felipe Ixtapa the first set of tools and materials by the Federal Government to begin construction of the road, so the work began this month and year. * San Juan Achiutla intervenes by Rutilio Ruiz Hern√°ndez in peacemaking, mediation and signing of the agreements of boundaries between San Miguel Achiutla and San Bartolom√© Yucua√±e, concluded between 1952 and 1953.

Such a centre was established in Tlaxiaco due to the community of San Miguel slow response to the INI. * On May 3, 1953, the Vanguardia Progresista de San Juan Achiutla en el Distrito Federal, headed by Ra√∫l Ruiz Bautista and other hard achiutlenses that would work to support their town with economic resources and materials for education and infrastructure, as well as for the annual Patron Saint festivities. * In May 1954 Alfonso Caso, National Indigenous Institute general director visits the Mixteca Alta and decides to support the construction of the road. * In August 1956 the Progressive Avant-garde of San Juan Achiutla in the Federal District identifies and invited 56 migrant achiutlenses in the State of Veracruz, to integrate an autonomous organization similar to the Progressive Avant-garde in the region of R√≠o Blanco and surrounding cities and towns, and systematically raise funds and send them to the municipality as a support for the town's development of public works and community services.

Ra√∫l Ruiz Bautista, published in 2010 and graded as high relevance by the library of the Congress of the United States.  Cultural traditions  The Mixtec culture, to which San Juan Achiutla and the achiutlecos belong, is a living culture, says Ronald Spores on the subject: :After the independence war the language √±u savi (√ëuu Dzaui) speakers retained their ethnic identity, their customs, and managed to adapt to the circumstances of the new country, initially in the Mixteca and eventually beyond: in Puebla, the central valleys, the North and Northwest Mexico; at present, can be found Mixtec everywhere in North America. This group tenacity and adaptability for more than 3,000 years deserves everyone's attention. Kiosk of San Juan Achiutla (demolished) :The Mixtec culture has developed and maintained for more than three millennia in a vast region which covers a territory of , which extends from South of Puebla to the Pacific coast and the Valley of Oaxaca to the East of Guerrero. The Mixteca region comprises three ecological zones: the High Mixteca ‚Äïescenario of the development of the main towns of this culture‚Äï, the Low Mixteca ‚Äïo √ëui√±e (\\"Tierra Caliente\\") ‚Äî and the Mixteca de la Costa. :We must remember that the Mixtec culture did not disappear with the conquest, during the colonial period, or in the 19th and 20th centuries radical national transformations. It exists today in the Mixteca, everywhere in Mexico and anywhere in the world where the Mixtecs have reached in its vast adaptation diaspora. Many have left the Mixteca, but their hearts, thoughts and feelings remain on their land and their tradition. :As reflected in La Canci√≥n Mixteca (a lyric) among multiple ethnic groups that form the Mexican Republic, perhaps the nation more sentimental, nostalgic and loyal to its roots is the √±u savi, the Mixtec nation. Following ancient cultural traditions are preserved in San Juan Achiutla: * The tequio, which is obligatory work as contribution to the town public works and services, that allows the people and the municipality to be clean and healthy place in an exemplary fashion. * The gueza (guelaguetza, give to receive) which is mutual support mainly in supplies or in cash between neighbors and relatives that bring to those who have a celebration, feast or compromise, such as weddings, baptisms, funerals or mayordom√≠as. The gueza reception is a solemn ceremony in which small speeches are addressed to deliver and receive the contributions, being a usual commitment to spontaneously to reciprocate the help at the moment in which the counterpart need it. * The mayordom√≠a which is the responsibility of an individual for the celebration of the Patron Saint San Juan fest, this custom however is of great economic burden for those who assume it. * The posadas are the festivities during eight days leading up to Christmas. Consist of put the nacimiento, give Posada to the pilgrims, with images of the pilgrims Mary and Joseph in a procession calling the Inn to the house inhabitants, who give after prayers and doubts, they offer to the pilgrims and the procession hot drinks, tamales, collations, gifts, breaking pi√±atas, pray the Rosary. * The pastorela of the town, staging Christmas performed with volunteer actors of the town prior to Christmas. * The danza del guajolote (Turkey dance), in which the salient mayordomo delivered a turkey as a gift through dancers to the new mayordomo. * The m√∫sica de viento (wind music band) of both religious and social present at every party. * The pre-Hispanic legend of El flechador del sol which Achiutla is mentioned.

He studied composition privately with David Del Tredici and Joseph Maneri, and at Harvard, where he earned a Ph.D. He is a member of the Common Sense Composers Collective. He is composer-mentor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic. In 1997, he composed a ballet version of Where the Wild Things Are in collaboration with Maurice Sendak and Septime Webre. He created three pieces for video and live instruments with directors Mary Harron (director of ‚ÄúAmerican Psycho‚Äù) and John C. Walsh. He has worked frequently with John Cale, notably on his score of American Psycho. He re-created four of Nico‚Äôs songs for Cale‚Äôs tribute concert ‚ÄúOn the Borderline‚Äù, sung by Peter Murphy, Lisa Gerrard, Sparklehorse, Stephin Merritt, Peaches, and Meshell Ndegeocello. He arranged over 40 of Cale‚Äôs songs for orchestra, including the entire Paris 1919 album (performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in January 2013), songs from The Velvet Underground and Nico, and \\"Music for a New Society\\". His works have been performed by Kathleen Supov√©, Jennifer Choi, Timothy Fain, Mary Rowell, Todd Reynolds, Ethel, conductor/flutist Ransom Wilson, Tara O‚ÄôConnor, Lindsey Goodman, the Brooklyn Philharmonic, the Kronos Quartet, Turnmusic, Fulcrum Point, the Pittsburgh New Music Ensemble, Sonic Generator, Bang on a Can/SPIT Orchestra, the American Composers Orchestra, NakedEye Ensemble, and others. Recordings and scores of most of Woolf's music are on his website, randallwoolf.com. His complete flute music is on http://flutterbyrandallwoolf.com/, an alluvial by CCA.

Its mission is to guarantee the readiness and deployment of the air force units based there. Since its opening in October 1959, the base has been home to the air force's jet fighter aircraft, with several of the units based there being equipped with F-86F Sabre, Fiat G.91, T-33 Shooting Star, T-38 Talon and A-7 Corsair II aircraft. The base is currently home to two F-16 Fighting Falcon squadrons. History The air base is located at the former installations of the aero club of Leiria, that existed from 1938 to 1941, when it became a military aerodrome of the Portuguese Army's aviation service. In 1952 the Army's aviation and the Portuguese Navy's aviation service were merged, resulting in the creation of the Portuguese Air Force, but the aerodrome wasn't actively used until the air base was established in 1959. Construction of the air base began in 1957 and was completed in 1959, it being officially inaugurated on 4 October by the President of the Republic Admiral Am√©rico Tom√°s. That same year the first Portuguese F-86F Sabre squadron, Esquadra 50 \\"Falc√µes\\", that was created the previous year, was transferred to Monte Real and was re-designated as 51 Squadron \\"Falc√µes\\" (Falcons). At the same time a second F-86F squadron, 52 Squadron \\"Galos\\" (Roosters), was also formed. Portuguese F-86F displayed at Monte Real Air Base Adopting the motto \\"Alcan√ßa Quem N√£o Cansa,\\" (attaining without ceasing) these two squadrons became part of the new Operational Group 501 and together totaled 50 F-86F combat aircraft. This number was later increased to 65 fighters. 52 Squadron was disbanded on 12 July 1961. Between 1974 and 1987 the Advanced Fighter Training Squadron (, E.I.C.P.A.C.), later re-designated as 103 Squadron, was based at Monte Real and operated the T-33A Shooting Star and T-38A Talon. On 24 December 1981, a new chapter began at Air Base No. 5 with the arrival of first nine A-7P Corsair II fighter aircraft. The number eventually grew to 20, and these aircraft formed 302 Attack Squadron, taking on the symbols and traditions of the 51 Squadron \\"Falc√µes.\\" On 28 June 1984, during a meeting of the NATO Commission of Infrastructures in Brussels, Monte Real was formally accepted as NATO infrastructure to be equipped with two attack squadrons of A-7P aircraft and a future interceptor squadron. On the 25th anniversary of the inauguration of Monte Real Air Base, 4 October 1984, the 304 Attack Squadron was officially activated and became the second attack squadron with A-7P aircraft. This squadron became the heir of the traditions, symbols, and deeds of the 93 Squadron \\"Magn√≠ficos\\" (Magnificents), deactivated at Air Base No. 9, in 1973 in Luanda, Africa. On 4 October 1993, the 201 Squadron was activated and equipped with F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters. This squadron resumed the mission of Air Defense, and inherited the traditions and symbol of the \\"Falc√µes.\\" On 25 November 2005, 301 Squadron was transferred to Air Base No. 5 from Air Base No. 11 in Beja and received the first F-16 fighters upgraded with the Mid-Life Update (F-16AM and F-16BM) of the Portuguese Air Force. The squadron maintained the symbols and traditions of the \\"Jaguares\\" (Jaguars). Work on the Portuguese Air Force's F-16 Mid-Life Update program is carried out at the workshops at Monte Real Air Base, namely the facilities designated as dock 4 (), as well the flight testing of the upgraded aircraft.

In this compound magnesium has an oxidation state of 2+. Magnesium acetate is the magnesium salt of acetic acid.Magnesium Acetate. Hazard.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-12. It is deliquescent and upon heating, it decomposes to form magnesium oxide.Magnesium Acetate Supplier & Tech Info American Elements Retrieved on 2012-04-12. Magnesium acetate is commonly used as a source of magnesium in biological reactions. Physical properties Magnesium acetate appears as white hygroscopic crystals. It smells like acetic acid and is soluble in water. When it is in an aqueous solution its pH will be on the alkaline side of neutral. Storage Due to the fact that it is very hygroscopic, it must be stored away from water. It is also incompatible with strong oxidizers and should not be mixed with them. Synthesis Synthesis of magnesium acetate from the reaction of magnesium hydroxide with acetic acid. :2 CH3COOH + Mg(OH)2 ‚Üí (CH3COO)2Mg + 2 H2O Magnesium carbonate suspended in distilled water with 20% acetic acid solution. :2 CH3COOH + MgCO3 ‚Üí Mg(CH3COO)2 \\\\+ CO2 \\\\+ H2O Reacting metallic magnesium with acetic acid dissolved in dry benzene causes magnesium acetate to form along with the release of hydrogen gas. :Mg +2 CH3COOH ‚Üí Mg(CH3COO)2 \\\\+ H2 Uses and applications In 1881 Charles Clamond invented the Clamond basket, one of the first effective gas mantles. The reagents used in this invention included magnesium acetate, magnesium hydroxide, and water. Magnesium acetate is commonly used as a source of magnesium or for the acetate ion in chemistry experiments. One example of this is when magnesium acetate and magnesium nitrate were both used to perform molecular dynamics simulations and surface tension measurements. In the experiment the authors found that the acetate had a stronger affinity for the surface compared to the nitrate ion and that the Mg2+ strongly repelled away from the air/liquid interference. They also found that the Mg2+ had a stronger tendency to bind with the acetate ion compared to the nitrate. One of the more prevalent uses of magnesium acetate is in the mixture called calcium magnesium acetate (CMA). It is a mixture of calcium acetate and magnesium acetate. CMA is thought of as an environmentally friendly alternative deicer to NaCl and CaCl2. CMA also acts as a powerful SO2, NOx, and toxic particulate emission control agent in coal combustion processes to reduce acid rain, and as an effective catalyst for the facilitation of coal combustion. Magnesium acetate has been found to cause a conformational change in Escherichia coli enzyme Primase. In this experiment Mg(OAc)2, MnCl2, CaCl2, NaOAc, LiCl, MgSO4 and MgCl2 were all compared to see what effect they had on the Escherichia coli enzyme Primase. The experimenters found that Mg(OAc)2 caused the best conformational change. MgSO4 and MgCl2 induced the effect slightly while the rest did not. When magnesium acetate is mixed with hydrogen peroxide it acts as a bactericidal. Magnesium acetate has been shown to be effective at ashing organic compounds in preparation for a fluorine analysis when high or low concentrations of fluorine are present. Safety Magnesium acetate is a relatively safe compound to handle and has been given a health hazard rating of zero. However, it should always be handled with gloves and safety goggles. If it gets in the eyes, the skin, ingested, or inhaled it will cause irritation in the respective areas: eyes, skin, gastrointestinal system, and lungs.

Environment The municipality covers an area of 945.4 km¬≤. The territory is rugged, with grazing and cultivation of coffee and corn practiced only the lower irregular plains. The Chiquito River runs through the northern part, a tributary of the Rio Grande. The climate is warm and humid, with rain almost all year round. The forested areas contain pine, cedar, and ceiba. People As of 2005, the municipality had 5,030 households with a total population of 22,478 of whom 10,712 spoke an indigenous language. The main town is now Mar√≠a Lombardo de Caso, located at a height of 140 meters above sea level. Although in a Mixe area, many of the people in this town are Mazatec or Chinantec who moved here after being displaced by the Miguel Alem√°n Dam in the 1960s. In the 1950s the remote municipality, accessible only via dirt track, drew visitors from the USA investigating use of hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms in the traditional Mixe ceremonies. Economy The main economic activity is coffee cultivation, followed by livestock raising. Some of the Mixe women of the village of San Juan Cotzocon use back strap looms to weave traditional huipil, rebosos, napkins, table cloths and other textile crafts.

Proving compensation for pure economic loss, examples of an economic tort include interference with economic or business relationships. Overview Economic torts protect people from interference with their trade or business. The area includes the doctrine of restraint of trade and has largely been submerged in the twentieth century by statutory interventions on collective labour law, modern antitrust or competition law, and certain laws governing intellectual property, particularly unfair competition law. The \\"absence of any unifying principle drawing together the different heads of economic tort liability has often been remarked upon.\\"p.509 Markesinis and Deakin's Tort Law (2003 5th Ed.) OUP) The principal torts can be listed as passing off, injurious falsehood and trade libel (see also Food libel laws), conspiracy, inducement of breach of contract, tortious interference (such as interference with economic relations or unlawful interference with trade), and watching and besetting. These torts represent the common law's historical attempt to balance the need to protect claimants against those who inflict economic harm and the wider need to allow effective, even aggressive, competition (including competition between employers and their workers). Two cases demonstrated economic tort's affinity to competition and labour law. In Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow & Co (1889) LR 23 QBD 598 the plaintiffs argued they had been driven from the Chinese tea market by a 'shipping conference', that had acted together to underprice them. But this cartel was ruled lawful and \\"nothing more [than] a war of competition waged in the interest of their own trade.\\"per Bowen LJ, (1889) LR 23 QBD 598, 614 Nowadays, this would be considered a criminal cartel. Workplace relations In English labour law the most notable case is Taff Vale Railway v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants.Taff Vale Railway v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants [1901] AC 426 The House of Lords thought that unions should be liable in tort for helping workers to go on strike for better pay and conditions. But it riled workers so much that it led to the creation of the British Labour Party and the Trade Disputes Act 1906 Further torts used against unions include conspiracy,Quinn v Leatham [1901] AC 495 interference with a commercial contractTorquay Hotels Ltd v Cousins [1968] or intimidation.Rookes v Barnard [1964] AC 1129 LegalDay Economic Torts Inducing breach of contract Several of the economic torts in English law, in particular inducing breach of contract and \\"tortious interference\\" (otherwise known as causing loss by unlawful means), have been reviewed and clarified by the House of Lords in the 2007 case of OBG v Allan.[2008] 1 AC 1, [2007] UKHL 21. *Lumley v Gye (1853) 2 E & B 216 *South Wales Miners‚Äô Federation v Glamorgan Coal Co Ltd [1905] AC 239, ‚ÄúIt would be idle to sue the workmen, the individual wrong-doers, even if it were practicable to do so.

Gafisa's predecessor company is Cimob Companhia Imobili√°ria (formerly known as Gafisa Participa√ß√µes S.A.), from whom Gafisa S.A. inherited brand name, assets, liabilities and market position. History Gafisa one of the leading companies in the ranking of the largest construction and real residential segment in Brazil, established in the developed markets more than 950 enterprises, among high-luxury residential condominiums, commercial buildings flats and shopping centers, representing approximately 10 million square meters of built area. Headquartered in S√£o Paulo and operations in other cities of the country, Gafisa was founded in 1954 in Rio de Janeiro, under the name Gomes de Almeida, Fernandes. At the end of the 80s became the Gafisa property and in 1997 from an association with GP Investments, has been called Gafisa SA In 2006 the Gafisa received a major shareholder: the Equity International Properties (EIP), a North American leader in real estate investment in Latin America, which belongs to Equity Group Investments (LLC), controlled by Samuel Zell. Decided to expand its area of operation and become a national company, in 2004, Gafisa created the Board of New Business to care exclusively for new markets beyond the Rio-S√£o Paulo. As a result of this strategy, the company is already present in Manaus (AM), Salvador (BA), Bel√©m (PA), Fortaleza (CE), Macei√≥ (AL), Goi√¢nia (GO), Porto Alegre (RS), Cuiab√° (MT ) in addition to cities in the interior of S√£o Paulo (Itu, Campinas, Santo Andr√©) and Rio de Janeiro (Maca√©). The beginning of 2006 was marked by the entry of Gafisa in the New Market of Bovespa corporate governance, from the completion of initial public offering of shares of the company. In 2007, the Gafisa made public offering of new shares, this time in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which became the first residential real Brazilian listed on NYSE. The event has consolidated its position as a company in line with global standards and global reputation in financial and operational excellence. Also in the first quarter of 2007, following the diversification of regional and residential products, the company strengthened the commitment to serve the segment of low income through the establishment of Fit Residencial, subsidiary of Gafisa ventures that will develop a low price in urban areas . The first release, the Fit Jacana, occurred in March. The Gafisa also signed a joint venture (JV) with Odebrecht, Brazil's largest engineering and construction, training of District New Ventures Real Estate. The new company will develop residential projects in large scale in the horizontal segment of people outside metropolitan areas. The Gafisa consolidates its position of leadership in the segment of middle and upper middle class and is now a more geographically diversified construction company of Brazil. The conclusion of the first phase of the acquisition of Alphaville further strengthened this position, expanding its presence in 18 states and 40 cities.

Slane Castle, Co. Meath, Ireland Fleming was a descendant of Archembald le Fleming of Bratton Fleming, Devon, who was alive in 1087. Archembald's grandson, Archembald fitz Stephen le Fleming, came to Ireland with King Henry II of England in 1171 and participated in Hugh de Lacy's plantation of the kingdom of Kingdom of Mide. He was the great-great grandfather of Simon. Simon was the son of Sir Baldwin Fleming, and Maud de Geneville, daughter of Simon de Geneville of Culmullin and Joan Fitz Leones. The elder Simon was a younger son of Geoffrey de Geneville, 1st Baron Geneville, Justiciar of Ireland. Simon was a member of the Irish Parliament of 1370. He became the lord of Slane in 1335 on the death of his father. In 1346 he served as Commissioner of the Peace in County Meath. In 1352 Slane was declared forfeit to the Crown, but Simon recovered it three years later. He had been knighted before 1365. He was in close attendance on Lionel of Antwerp, younger son of King Edward III, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, during his years in Ireland. He spent much of his time in England, and acquired extensive lands in Devon and Cornwall (he was related by marriage to a number of prominent local families, notably the Bassets and Champernownes). In 1363-4 he was a prominent member of the \\"reform party\\", which campaigned against the widespread corruption and maladministration of the Irish Government: he was part of a powerful delegation sent by the Irish House of Commons to England to outline their grievances, and King Edward III appointed him to a royal commission to consider what reforms to government were necessary. The reform party had some success: in particular they secured the removal from office, for a time, of Thomas de Burley, the notoriously corrupt Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Simon married Cecily Champernowne, daughter of Sir Thomas Champernowne, of Modbury, Devon and his wife Eleanor de Rohart. The Champernownes were a distinguished and long-established Devonshire family: notable later members included Kat Ashley, n√©e Champernowne, the much-loved governess of Queen Elizabeth I, and Sir Walter Raleigh, whose mother was a Champernowne. Simon was succeeded by his son, Thomas, born c. 1358, died c.1434/1435. He also had at least two daughters, Matilda, who married Luke Cusack, and Margaret, who married Sir William Basset of Tehidy, Cornwall.

This corneal layer, representing about 85-90% of corneal thickness, is built up from highly regular collagenous lamellae and extracellular matrix components. Keratocytes play the major role in keeping it transparent, healing its wounds, and synthesizing its components. In the unperturbed cornea keratocytes stay dormant, coming into action after any kind of injury or inflammation. Some keratocytes underlying the site of injury, even a light one, undergo apoptosis immediately after the injury. Any glitch in the precisely orchestrated process of healing may cloud the cornea, while excessive keratocyte apoptosis may be a part of the pathological process in the degenerative corneal disorders such as keratoconus, and these considerations prompt the ongoing research into the function of these cells. Origin and functions Keratocytes are developmentally derived from the cranial population of neural crest cells, from whence they migrate to settle in the mesenchyme. In some species the migration from neural crest comes in two waves, with the first giving birth to the corneal endothelium and the second invading the epithelium-secreted stromal anlage devoid of cells; in other species both populations come from a single wave of migration. Once settled in the stroma, keratocytes start synthesizing collagen molecules of different types (I, V, VI) and keratan sulfate. By the moment of eye opening after birth the proliferation of keratocytes is all but finished and most of them are in the quiescent state. By the end of eye development an interconnected keratocyte network is established in the cornea, with dendrites of neighbouring cells contacting each other. Quiescent keratocytes synthesize the so-called crystallins, known primarily for their role in the lens. Corneal crystallins, like the lens ones, are thought to help maintain the transparency and optimal refraction. They are also part of corneal antioxidant defense. Crystallins expressed by human keratocytes are ALDH1A1, ALDH3A1, ALDH2 and TKT. Different sets of crystallins are typical to distinct species. Keratan sulfate produced by keratocytes is thought to help maintain optimal corneal hydration; genetic disruption of its synthesis leads to the macular corneal dystrophy.MACULAR DYSTROPHY, CORNEAL, 1; MCDC1 - OMIM. According to one study, average keratocyte density in the human stroma is about 20500 cells per mm3, or 9600 in a column of 1 mm2 in section. The highest density is observed in the upper 10% of the stroma. The number of keratocytes declines with age, at a rate approximately 0.45% per year. After an injury to the cornea, some keratocytes undergo apoptosis, prompted by the signaling molecules secreted by the upper layers, such as IL1 alpha and TNF-alpha. Other neighbouring keratocytes, when acted upon by the same molecules, become active, proliferate and start synthesizing matrix metalloproteinases that cause tissue remodeling. These activated cells are designated in different sources either as \\"active keratocytes\\" or \\"fibroblasts\\" or are said to assume a \\"repair phenotype\\". After heavier injuries or at the advanced stages of healing process a number of keratocytes transforms into myofibroblasts actively secreting ECM components; this transformation is thought to be caused by TGF-beta. As soon as the basement membrane of corneal epithelium is restored, TGF beta inflow into the stroma drastically decreases and myofibroblasts disappear, after which the remaining activated keratocytes continue for some time to reshape the extracellular matrix, secreting IL1-alpha in order to maintain their \\"repair phenotype\\". Apoptosis of keratocytes, either in quiescent or active state, is a process that attracts special attention. In a healthy cornea the programmed cell death is a rare occasion, but immediately after an injury to the uppermost layer keratocytes directly under the injury site commit apoptosis. One hypothesis explains such rapid reaction by the need to stem the possible infection from spreading into the cornea, because due to the limitations of ocular immune system the immune cells take up to several hours to arrive at the site of injury. In a normal course of events, the lack of keratocytes is gradually replenished by the mitosis of the adjacent cells. Apoptosis is observed after eye operations, including keratotomy and laser surgery, and may play a role in the development of post-surgery complications.  Clinical significance  Alcohol dehydrogenase immunoreactivity in a healthy cornea (top), in Fuchs' dystrophy and keratoconic cornea. Diaminobenzidine stains keratocytes in the cross-section of cornea. From Mootha et al., 2009. Keratocytes may play a role in different corneal disorders. According to comparative research, their functions drastically diverge from the norm in keratoconus, the most frequent form of corneal dystrophy. In keratoconic corneas they have been shown to commit apoptosis far away from any epithelial injury; a hypothesis exists that presents excessive keratocyte apoptosis as a major pathological event in keratoconus. According to one study, patient's keratocytes have decreased levels of one of the alcohol dehydrogenase subforms, they secrete significantly less superoxide dismutase 3, according to another.

The second dedication to St Eadburgha may be relatively modern: A Topographical Dictionary of England (1848) lists it as being dedicated to St. Aldelme (sic) only.'Braodheath - Brockhall', in A Topographical Dictionary of England, ed. Samuel Lewis (London, 1848), pp. 389-392. British History Online [accessed 1 December 2019]. Old English and Medieval spellings are found in various forms, and St. Eadburgha is probably not to be confused with Edburga of Bicester, an English saint from the 7th century and a daughter of King Penda of Mercia. There are thought to be only two churches dedicated to her, in Bicester and Stratton Audley, both in Oxfordshire. The church's isolated position away from the village is thought to be because of an outbreak of the plague. The churchyard cross is also from the 13th century. The church also still houses the original wooden bier used at funerals over a century ago.

He worked in probability theory, specializing in interacting particle systems. Liggett had contributed to numerous areas of probability theory, including subadditive ergodic theory, random graphs, renewal theory, and was best known for his pioneering work on interacting particle systems, including the contact process, the voter model, and the exclusion process. His two books in this field have been influential. Liggett was the managing editor of the Annals of Probability from 1985-1987\\\\. He held a Sloan Research Fellowship from 1973-1977, and a Guggenheim Fellowship from 1997-1998\\\\. He was the Wald Memorial Lecturer of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1996, and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2008. He had been elected to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 2012, and in 2012 he also became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-01-27. Liggett moved at the age of two with his missionary parents to Latin America, where he was educated in Buenos Aires (Argentina) and San Juan (Puerto Rico). He graduated from Oberlin College in 1965, where he was influenced towards probability by Samuel Goldberg (b. 1925), an ex- student of William Feller. He moved to Stanford, taking classes with Kai Lai Chung, and writing a PhD thesis in 1969 with advisor Samuel Karlin on problems associated with the invariance principle. He joined the faculty at UCLA in 1969, where he spent his career until his death in May 2020.

He is mainly remembered for his kidnapping of the senior judge Richard Rede, from whom he extorted a large ransom. He managed to escape any punishment for the crime. Background Thomas was the son of Simon Fleming, 1st Baron Slane, and his wife Cecily Champernowne, daughter of Sir Thomas Champernowne of Modbury, Devon. He was the Commander of the Guardians of the Peace in County Meath in about 1385, and again in 1400. He was knighted in 1396. In 1412 he was licensed to hold a market and fair at Drumconrath in County Meath. Abduction of Richard Rede From what is known of his character, Thomas seems to have been ruthless, determined and unscrupulous. The marriage of the wealthy heiress Elizabeth Netterville of Dowth to Richard Rede, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, had given grave offence to other landowning families in Meath, who had hoped to marry her to one or other of their heirs. In 1394, some years before her marriage, Elizabeth had been abducted by the Cusack and Darcy families in an apparent attempt to gain control of her lands, and there were rumours of a similar plot in 1400. Slane and his son Christopher evidently settled on the simpler plan of extracting money from her husband. On April 1401 they ambushed Rede at Skryne, and imprisoned him in their castle nearby. He was not released until he paid a ransom of ¬£1000, a vast sum at the time, and he was also robbed of ¬£200 which he had on his person, and some valuable official records. So serious a crime, involving an assault on a senior judge by a Commissioner for the Peace, might have been expected to bring down severe retribution on the wrongdoers. The outraged Rede himself demanded the most severe penalties. At first the Crown appeared to take a grave view of the matter, and a powerful commission was appointed to arrest Slane and his wife. In that era however the nobility could generally win a royal pardon even for the most serious of crimes, and Slane was pardoned after paying a ¬£30 fine (a tiny sum compared to what he had extorted from Rede). Family He married Elizabeth Preston, daughter of Christopher Preston, 2nd Baron Gormanston and his wife Elizabeth de Londres: they had at least two sons: Christopher Fleming, 3rd Baron Slane, and Sir William Fleming. William was the father of James Fleming, 7th Baron Slane. Sources *G. E. C., ed. Geoffrey F. White. The Complete Peerage.
