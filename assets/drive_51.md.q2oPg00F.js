Geography The village lies at the head of Kinvara Bay, known in Irish as Cinn Mhara (or more recently Cuan Chinn Mhara), an inlet in the south-eastern corner of Galway Bay, from which the village took its name. It lies in the north of the barony of Kiltartan, close to the border with The Burren in County Clare, in the province of Munster. Kinvara is also situated in the territory of U√≠ Fiachrach Aidhne, which is coextensive with the diocese of Kilmacduagh ('). The civil parish is bounded on the north by Galway Bay, on the east by the parishes of Ballinderreen (Killeenavarra) and Ardrahan, on the south by the parishes of Gort (Kilmacduagh) and Boston (Kilkeedy) and on the west by the parishes of Carron and New Quay (Abbey and Oughtmama). It is roughly coextensive with the √ì hEidhin territory of Coill Ua bhFiachrach (wood of the U√≠ Fhiachrach) and this name was still in use in the mid-19th century as recorded by John O'Donovan in his Ordnance Survey letters. History=Dunguaire Castle= D√∫n Guaire castle Dunguaire Castle ( [lit, the Castle of Guaire]), a towerhouse of the ' (O'Hynes) clan, is located to the east of the village. A Fearadhach √ì hEidhin (Faragh O'Hynes) is recorded as the owner of the castle in a 1574 list of castles and their owners covering County Galway. This list was thought to have been compiled for the use of the Lord Deputy Sir Henry Sidney who planned the composition of Connacht. Eoghan Mantach √ì hEidhin (Eoin Mantagh O'Hynes), chief of the clan, is mentioned as the owner of the castle in the Indentures of Composition of 1585. A view of Kinvara from Dunguaire Castle. =Terry Alts= The Terry Alt agrarian resistance movement of the early 19th century was active in the Kinvara area. In 1831, a large force of Terry Alts gathered on the Galway/Clare border on Abbey Hill between Kinvara and New Quay, County Clare and challenged the (British) army to battle. They, however, dispersed before the arrival of the soldiers. They also unsuccessfully attempted to ambush a body of infantry at Corranroo in the west of the parish, which led to the death of one of their members. Population The electoral division population related to Kinvara according to the 2011 Census was 1,351. The Great Famine in the 1840s and a series of emigrations that continued until the 1960s reduced the population of the village - once a thriving port and a significant exporter of corn and seaweed - to no more than a few hundred people. From around the 1980s the population of the parish of Kinvara started to increase while the village started to grow in size. Religion In the Catholic Church, the Ecclesiastical parish of Kinvara is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora and comprises the civil parishes of, Kinvarradoorus and Killinny (Killina). The area is part of the Church of Ireland united Diocese of Limerick and Killaloe. Festivals Street of Kinvara in 2007 Kinvara is home every year to two festivals, ' (\\"the cuckoo festival\\") an Irish music festival at the start of May and the Cruinni√∫ na mB√°d (\\"gathering of the boats\\") in mid August.

Williamson played as a striker for Clydebank, Rangers, West Bromwich Albion, Rotherham United and Kilmarnock. He then became a manager at Kilmarnock, winning the 1996‚Äì97 Scottish Cup. Williamson moved to Hibernian in 2002, but had less success there and left in 2004 to manage Plymouth Argyle. He was sacked by Argyle after just over a year in charge. After a short stint with Chester City, Williamson became manager of the Uganda national football team. After a spell with Kenyan Premier League club Gor Mahia during which he won the league title, Williamson was appointed as the manager of Kenya national football team. Playing career As a player, Williamson was a striker. He began his career at Clydebank and scored 35 goals in 85 matches. Williamson earned a ¬£100,000 move to Rangers during the 1983‚Äì84 season. Five months after signing for Rangers, Williamson broke his right leg while on a night out during an end of season tour of Australia. The injury was initially expected to keep him out of action for two or three months, but Williamson did not return to full training until December 1984. After an injury-hit spell with Rangers, Williamson moved to West Bromwich Albion in 1986, in part-exchange for Jimmy Nicholl. Williamson also played in the Football League for Rotherham United. He returned to Scotland in 1990 to join Kilmarnock, which proved to be his last club as a player. Managerial career=Kilmarnock= Williamson became the manager of Kilmarnock following the departure of Alex Totten. In his first season as manager, the club won the 1997 Scottish Cup Final by beating Falkirk 1‚Äì0 at Ibrox. Kilmarnock finished highly in the Scottish Premier League and he guided them into Europe, playing a total of four two-legged ties over three seasons. He also attracted high-profile players including former Scotland internationals Ally McCoist and Ian Durrant, and the former French international Christophe Cocard. =Hibernian= Williamson took up a new challenge at Hibernian in February 2002, where he inherited a team that had gone 18 league games without a win. A win against St Johnstone in Williamson's first match in charge effectively removed the danger of relegation. Due to financial problems at the club, Williamson had to move on several senior players, but he did not endear himself to the Hibs fans. He lightheartedly joked about this relationship by referring to himself as a \\"weegie hun\\". Nonetheless Hibs produced several excellent young players, including Scott Brown, Derek Riordan, Garry O'Connor, Kevin Thomson and Steven Whittaker. Williamson guided his young team to the 2004 Scottish League Cup Final, but they were beaten 2‚Äì0 by Livingston. =Plymouth= Williamson moved to Plymouth Argyle on 20 April 2004. By winning his first match in charge, the club won promotion to the Football League Championship. After keeping the Pilgrims in the division in his first full campaign, a poor run of results at the start of the 2005‚Äì06 season led to his dismissal on 6 September 2005. Financial constraints at Plymouth Argyle resulted in a number of signings which contributed to his demise, most notably Taribo West. He was replaced by Tony Pulis, who had recently been sacked by fellow Championship side Stoke City. =Chester= Williamson appeared as a pundit on BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound before he was appointed as Chester City manager on 11 May 2007. Williamson's first Football League match in charge of Chester ended in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Chesterfield on 11 August 2007 and has established them as a promotion contender in the opening months of the season. After mid-season, Chester's form began to drop rapidly, winning only 1 out of 14 games since Boxing Day; Williamson was sacked on 2 March 2008. =Uganda= On 19 August 2008, Williamson was appointed by FUFA to be the coach of the Uganda national football team. Williamson replaced Csaba L√°szl√≥, who resigned in July 2008 to join Scottish Premier League side Hearts. Within days of being appointed, Williamson was given the ultimatum of winning his first two games against Niger and Benin to earn a longer contract. He succeeded in doing that, and their FIFA World Ranking steadily improved during his first two years in charge. Williamson led his Uganda team to the 2011 CECAFA Cup. Uganda almost qualified for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, losing on a penalty shootout in their qualifying playoff tie against Zambia. Uganda had a bad start to 2014 World Cup qualifying, taking just two points from three games. It was announced on 8 April 2013 that Williamson had been sacked by Uganda. =Gor Mahia= On 5 July 2013, it was announced that Williamson agreed terms with Tusker Premier League side Gor Mahia to join the club as their new head coach. He replaced Croatian counterpart Zdravko Logarusiƒá, who was sacked by the club 9 days earlier, on 25 June. Williamson led Gor Mahia to their first national league championship in 18 years. =Kenya= In August 2014, Williamson was appointed manager of the Kenya national team.Bobby Williamson appointed Kenya coach, BBC SportBobby Williamson signs contract to become Kenya coach, BBC Sport He took over the post after his last game with Gor Mahia in a league game against Sony Sugar on 24 August.

This device is a variation of Mueller's original crocodile clip design, which was invented by Ralph Mueller in the early 1900s. Standard clip Crocodile clips, also called automotive clips, on a set of jumper cables Three crocodile clips: a bare standard-sized clip; a miniature clip in a yellow plastic boot; a large red Square D multi-function clip. Pair of standard clips A crocodile clip (also alligator clip) is a sprung metal clip with long, serrated jaws which is used for creating a temporary electrical connection. This simple mechanical device gets its name from the resemblance of its jaws to those of an alligator or crocodile. It is used to connect an electrical cable to a battery or some other component. Functioning much like a spring-loaded clothespin, the clip's tapered, serrated jaws are forced together by a spring to grip an object. When manufactured for electronics testing and evaluation, one jaw of the clip is typically permanently crimped or soldered to a wire, or is bent to form the inner tubular contact of a ~4 mm female banana jack, enabling quick non- permanent connection between a circuit under test and laboratory equipment or to another electrical circuit. The clip is typically covered by a plastic shroud or \\"boot\\" to prevent accidental short-circuits. Small versions, ranging in size from 15‚Äì40 mm in length, are used in electrical laboratory work. Large versions of these clips, called automotive clips or battery clamps, are made of solid copper for low electrical resistance, and are used with thick insulated copper cables to make connections between automobile batteries. These jumper cables (a.k.a. 'jump leads') are capable of delivering hundreds of Amperes of current needed to directly power an automobile starter motor, or to transfer energy from a charged lead-acid battery to a discharged one.  Specifications  The United States Defense Logistics Agency specifies several types of electrical clips in Commercial Item Description (CID) A-A-59466. In this CID document, crocodile clips are designated type CC, alligator clips are designated types TCx, and other types of electrical clips have various other, unique designations.  Other uses  * Dentistry: crocodile clips are often used on the ends of a cord in dental offices to attach a protective bib over the patient's clothing. * Laboratory: crocodile clips are frequently used to quickly and cheaply assemble or modify experimental circuits. They are useful for connecting components to wires. * Education: like their laboratory use, crocodile clips are sometimes used with batteries, small lightbulbs and other small electrical devices in schools to teach students about electricity. * Fencing: crocodile clips are used in fencing to connect to participants' lam√© vests to touch-detection systems. * Hobby: crocodile clips can be used as miniature clamps to hold parts together for gluing or soldering. ** Helping hands typically have two crocodile clips. * Camping: crocodile clips may be designed to attach a rope to a tarp or other sheet of material. (While this serves the same purpose as a grommet, it may lead to premature wear at the point of attachment.) * Drug use: as a roach clip for holding burning cannabis to avoid burning fingers. * Erotic use: as a clamp upon one's nipples for sexual gratification. See nipple clamp for more information on this usage. * Film/animation: useful for airborne scenes in possible stop-motion or holding models of any sort in mid air. * Electronics: useful as a heat sink while soldering heat-sensitive devices.  Kelvin clip  A Kelvin clip is a special form of crocodile clip. The jaws of a Kelvin clip are insulated from each other, allowing 2 isolated wires to connect to a single test point. This enables 4-wire measurement of circuits with very low resistances.

The Badge of Military Merit was a military award of the United States Armed Forces. It is largely considered America's first military decoration, and the second oldest in the world (after the Cross of St. George). The award was only given to non- commissioned officers and privates. The Purple Heart is the official successor decoration of the Badge of Military Merit. History The Badge of Military Merit was first announced in General George Washington's general orders to the Continental Army issued on August 7, 1782, at the Headquarters in Newburgh. Designed by Washington in the form of a purple heart, it was intended as a military order for soldiers who exhibited, \\"not only instances of unusual gallantry in battle, but also extraordinary fidelity and essential service in any way.\\" =First awards= The writings of General Washington indicate that three badges, two Honorary Badges of DistinctionHonorary Badges of distinction are to be conferred on the veteran Non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the army who have served more than three years with bravery, fidelity and good conduct; for this purpose a narrow piece of white of an angular form is to be fixed to the left arm on the uniform Coat. Non commissioned officers and soldiers who have served with equal reputation more than six years are to be distinguished by two pieces of cloth set in to each other in a form; should any who are not entitled to these honors have the insolence to assume the badges of them they shall be severely punished. On the other hand it is expected those gallant men who are thus designated will on all occasions be treated with particular confidence and consideration. George Washington's General Orders of August 7, 1782 and a Badge of Military Merit, were created on August 7, 1782. This is thought to be the first time in modern history that military awards had been presented to common soldiers. The practice in Europe was to honor high-ranking officers who had achieved victory, rather than honoring common soldiers. But in America, as General Washington said, the \\"road to glory in a patriot army and a free country is‚Ä¶open to all.\\" The French Royal Army had however started awarding the Medal of the Two Swords (M√©daillon Des Deux √âp√©es), a woven breast badge for enlisted soldiers in 1771. On August 7, 1782, Washington issued a general order detailing the badge: Recipients Most historians indicate that only four people received the Badge of Military Merit during the American Revolutionary War, all of them noncommissioned officers, and the only ones who received the award from General Washington himself. Those soldiers are as follows: On May 3, 1783 *Sergeant William Brown of the 5th Connecticut Regiment of the Connecticut Line *Sergeant Elijah Churchill of the 2nd Regiment Light Dragoons On June 10, 1783 *Sergeant Daniel Bissell of the 2nd Connecticut Regiment of the Connecticut Line On June 30, 1783 *Sergeant Louis Marney, Col. Hazen's 2nd Canadian Regiment Period records, however, indicate that several others may have been awarded the Badge of Military Merit for service in the American Revolutionary War. Status of original badges Brown's badge was found in a Deerfield, New Hampshire barn in the 1920s. There is disagreement in published sources about what became of Brown's badge after that. A badge on display at the American Independence Museum in Exeter, New Hampshire on behalf of the Society of the Cincinnati, New Hampshire Branch is stated to be Brown's. Other sources say that Brown's badge was reported lost in 1924 while in the possession of Bishop Paul Matthews, and that the badge on display in Exeter belongs to a fourth, unknown recipient. As of 2015, Churchill's badge was owned by the National Temple Hill Association and on display at the New Windsor Cantonment State Historic Site. Churchill's badge was rediscovered when H. E. Johnson, a Michigan farmer and one of Churchill's descendants, wrote to the National Temple Hill Association about the badge. Bissell's badge was reportedly lost when his house burned in July 1813. Disuse After the Revolutionary War, the Badge of Military Merit fell into disuse although it was never officially abolished. In 1932, the United States War Department authorized the new Purple Heart Medal for soldiers who had previously received either a Wound Chevron or the Army Wound Ribbon. At that time, it was also determined that the Purple Heart Medal would be considered the official \\"successor decoration\\" to the Badge of Military Merit.

He batted and threw right-handed. During his playing days, Galarraga stood tall, weighing . Galarraga began his professional career in Venezuela at the age of 16. Despite several injuries that plagued Galarraga throughout his career, he was a very popular player both for his achievements on the field, and for his big and bright smile. He was nicknamed The Big Cat (textually translated from English as El Gran Gato, although his nickname in his native Venezuela was El Gato) for his impressively quick reflexes and seamless defensive skills as a first baseman in spite of his large physical size. Galarraga was a five-time National League (NL) All-Star, won two NL Gold Glove Awards and two NL Silver Slugger Awards, and won two MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award, the second time after his successful return to baseball following cancer treatment. Career=Venezuelan Winter League= Galarraga was signed by the Leones del Caracas as a catcher and third baseman. He made his debut in the ‚Äì season. Some of the players Galarraga had as teammates included big-leaguers Tony Armas, Bo D√≠az, Manny Trillo, Gonzalo M√°rquez, and Leo Hern√°ndez. Galarraga originally started as a utility player, but three seasons later he became the regular first baseman of the team. At the recommendation of team manager Felipe Alou, he was signed by the Expos in 1979. At that time, some MLB scouts thought the 17-year-old power-hitting prodigy was too overweight to play professionally. Galarraga played with this team until 1993, when he retired from Venezuelan Winter League. =Minor leagues= In Minor League Baseball (MiLB), Galarraga played for the West Palm Beach Expos (, ‚Äì), Calgary Expos (1979‚Äì), Jamestown Expos (), Jacksonville Suns (), and Indianapolis Indians (). Galarraga was named Double-A Southern League Most Valuable Player for Jacksonville in 1984, with a .289 batting average (BA), 27 home runs (HR) and 87 runs batted in (RBI). He also led the league in total bases (271), slugging percentage (.508), intentional base on balls (10), hit by pitches (9), and in double plays (130) and total chances (1428) at first base. Prior to his major league promotion, Galarraga hit .269/25/85, in 121 games with Indianapolis, being named as the Triple-A International League (IL) Rookie of the Year. =Montreal Expos (1985‚Äì1991)= Galarraga made his debut with Montreal on August 23, 1985. During that season‚Äôs last six-plus weeks, he struggled, hitting .187 (14-for-75), with two homers, and four RBI, in 24 games. Galarraga had a promising start in , but it was interrupted, when he suffered a knee injury; at the time, he had already posted eight home runs and was leading all NL rookies with 25 runs batted in. Galarraga underwent arthroscopic knee surgery, on July 10. He was activated one month later, only to be re-injured the following day after pulling muscles in his rib cage. Galarraga returned to action in September, ending with .271, 10 HR, and 42 RBI, in 105 games. Galarraga with the Phillie Phanatic in 1987 Overshadowed by some teammates, Galarraga survived a tough rookie year and quietly enjoyed a consistently strong season. He hit .305, 13 HR, 90 RBI, finishing second in the league in doubles (40). Despite his size, Galarraga displayed solid defense, being adept at scooping throws out of the dirt and excellent quickness turning the 3-6-3 double play. Cardinals' manager Whitey Herzog called him \\"the best-fielding right-handed first baseman I've seen since Gil Hodges.\\" In , Galarraga emerged from the shadows to become the best player on the Expos. He had an MVP-caliber season with a .302 batting average, 99 runs, 29 HR, and 92 RBI. Galarraga also led the league in hits (184) and doubles (42), and earned an All-Star berth for the first time in his career. He was named the Montreal Expos Player of the Year at the end of the season. was a rough season however for the Big Cat. Galarraga became a target of Montreal fans' frustration when he tailed off after the All-Star game. That year, Galarraga led the league in strikeouts (158), dropping his production to .257, 23 HR, and 85 RBI. He fell five RBI short of becoming the first Expo to string together three straight seasons with 90 or more RBI. Despite the rough season, Galarraga blasted his first grand slam, stole home for the first time in his career, and was rewarded with a Gold Glove Award for his stellar play at first base. Galarraga's season had Expos mumbling that the team should lower its expectations for the slick-fielding first baseman. For the second consecutive season, the Big Cat failed to repeat the standards he set in his first two full seasons. Galarraga hit .256 with 20 home runs and 87 RBI, almost a mirror image of his previous season. For the third consecutive year, he led the league in strikeouts; pitchers exploited Galarraga‚Äôs impatience at the plate and didn't give him good pitches to hit. Even without any improvement with the bat, Galarraga continued to make tremendous contributions on the field, scooping up infielder's errant throws, starting 3-6-3 double plays, and winning his second Gold Glove. That season he also had a six-RBI game, two four-RBI games, and hit his first career inside-the-park home run. Slowed by injuries, Galarraga struggled through the worst offensive season of his career in . Disabled with a strained left hamstring between May and July, he later had arthroscopic surgery to repair damage to the undersurface of his left kneecap. Montreal missed Galarraga‚Äòs glove as much as his bat, committing 43 infield errors in 53 games without him. That season, Galarraga hit .219, 9 HR, and 33 RBI, in 107 games. He stole home for the second time in his career and hit his 100th career home run. At the end of the season, Galarraga was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for starting pitcher Ken Hill. =St. Louis Cardinals (1992)= Galarraga had a second chance with the Cardinals; however, a pitch broke his wrist early in the season and he didn't recover until July. Galarraga batted .296 after the All-Star break and hit all ten of his homers after July 1 for a .497 second-half slugging percentage. He finished with a .243 BA and 39 RBI, but made a good impression on Cardinals batting coach Don Baylor. When Baylor became the first Rockies manager in the off-season, he recommended that Colorado take a chance on Galarraga and sign him as a free agent. =Colorado Rockies (1993‚Äì1997)=National League batting champion (1993) Galarraga with the Rockies in 1996 By joining the Rockies, Galarraga was given new life for his career. In a season full of remarkable individual achievements, he solidified his stature as an accomplished hitter, and flirted with the .400 mark for much of the season. Galarraga‚Äòs final .370 BA was a 127-point increase over his previous year mark. He led National League batters in batting average, and it was the highest average by a right- handed hitter since Joe DiMaggio batted .381 in . Despite missing 42 games with assorted injuries, The Big Cat compiled 56 multi-hit games to lead the league. He added 22 homers, 98 RBI, 71 runs, 35 doubles, four triples, a .403 on-base percentage, and his .602 slugging percentage was second in the league. Galarraga‚Äòs .370 mark made him the first player on an expansion team as well as the first Venezuelan to win a batting title. Tony Gwynn hit .358 to finish as runner-up in the title race. Galarraga's improvement began when Baylor drastically opened up his stance to make him quicker on inside pitches. The new stance also helped Galarraga generate more power to the opposite field. At the same time, facing the pitcher with two eyes gave him a better view at pitches, lowering his strikeout rate and making him much more consistent at the plate with better contact. Galarraga finished 10th in the MVP selection, but won The Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award. After the season, and for third time, he underwent arthroscopic knee surgery. In the strike- shortened season, Galarraga set a new National League record in April by driving in 30 runs in a month. He seemed to be on his way to a terrific year again, but he fractured his right hand on July 28. At the time of Galarraga‚Äòs injury, Colorado had climbed to within a half-game of the first place Los Angeles Dodgers. Without him however, the Rockies went 3‚Äì10 the rest of the way. Galarraga paced the club with 31 homers (fifth in the league), and batted .319 with 85 RBI. On June 25, 1995, Galarraga hit a home run in three consecutive innings to tie an MLB record. He finished the season hitting .280, with 31 homers, and 106 RBI. Galarraga‚Äôs numbers were helped by the fact that he stayed healthy for the first time in four years. That season, the Rockies had four players with 30 or more home runs, matching the Dodgers. On August 29 of the same season, in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Galarraga spoiled Paul Wagner's bid for a no-hitter, by singling with two out in the ninth; it was the only hit Wagner would allow in defeating the Rockies 4‚Äì0. Over the next few seasons, Galarraga developed into one of the best RBI-men in baseball, driving in a combined 411 runs between and (150, 140, and 121). In the same period, he batted .304, .318, and .305, with 47, 41, and 44 HR, respectively. Some critics argued that Galarraga‚Äòs achievements were possible thanks to the thin-air, mile-high, hitter-friendly Coors Field, but he also belted many homers on the road that traveled over . NL RBI leader (1997) Perhaps the most famous home run Galarraga hit was a mammoth grand slam off Kevin Brown on May 31, 1997, which landed 20 rows deep into the upper deck at Florida Marlins' Pro Player Stadium. It may also be his most debated home run with a distance initially measured at and then . At the time, it set a record for both the Rockies and the stadium. In 2011, ESPN's Home Run Tracker recalculated the distance to . Previously, Galarraga smashed two homers in two games that traveled and respectively, totaling , an average of each. The Rockies released Galarraga at the end of the season to make room at first base for prospect Todd Helton. At the time of his release, Galarraga was the club's all-time leader in home runs (172) and RBI (579). As a free agent, he signed a three-year contract with the Atlanta Braves. =Atlanta Braves (1998‚Äì2000)= During Galarraga‚Äôs first season in Atlanta (1998), he silenced his critics. Galarraga proved that he could still have great power production at lower altitudes, hitting .305, with 44 HR, and 121 RBI. This made him the first player in MLB history to hit 40 or more homers in consecutive seasons for two different teams. During spring training, Galarraga developed a sore back. Treatment from the team's trainers and team doctor included hydrobaths, massages, muscle relaxers, and stretching, but would not stop the nagging soreness. Galarraga was referred to a medical oncologist in Atlanta for a thorough physical exam and an MRI. When the diagnosis came in, the famous Galarraga smile disappeared. On the second lumbar vertebra in his lower back, Galarraga had a tumor known as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of lymphatic cancer. He missed the entire 1999 season receiving chemotherapy treatments. Rockies third baseman and ex-teammate Vinny Castilla switched briefly from his traditional number 9 to number 14 on his jersey, to honor Galarraga's cancer fight. In Spring , Galarraga returned to the field in high spirits and good physical shape after undergoing chemotherapy and a strict workout routine. In his third at-bat of opening day of the 2000 season, Galarraga knocked in the winning run with a home run, and he showed his big smile again. In April and May, he was tied for first place in home runs in the National League and he was batting .300. At the end of the season, Galarraga had batted .302, with 28 HR, and 100 RBI. He was awarded his second National League Comeback Player of the Year Award by The Sporting News. Galarraga asked the Braves‚Äô ownership for a two-year contract, but the most that it would offer was a one-year contract. Hence, he decided to become a free agent, and signed with the Texas Rangers, who were willing to offer Galarraga the contract for two years that he sought. =Rangers, Giants, and Expos (2001‚Äì2003)= The change of baseball leagues affected Galarraga badly in . At age 40, he found himself \\"lost\\" in a different league, facing different pitchers, and stuck in a back-up position with the star Rafael Palmeiro as the main first baseman for the Texas Rangers. Galarraga was used mainly as a designated hitter (DH), as a pinch-hitter, and occasionally as a starter against left-handed pitchers. After a disappointing .235 batting average, 10 home runs, and 34 RBI, in 72 games, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants, at mid-season. In , Galarraga signed with the Expos for the full season. He then returned to the Giants in , after signing a minor league contract, prior to the season. As a part-time player with the Giants, Galarraga batted .301, with 12 HR, and 42 RBI. =Anaheim Angels (2004)= In , Galarraga's cancer recurred and he underwent two three-week periods of chemotherapy and was hospitalized for 23 days for additional treatment. This was the same non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that had sidelined Galarraga in 1999, but he beat it for the second time and began play with the Anaheim Angels' Triple-A affiliate, the Salt Lake City Stingers. When rosters were expanded in September, Galarraga came back to the major leagues. Although he served mostly as a bench player in Anaheim, Galarraga was highly regarded in the clubhouse, especially among younger players such as Vladimir Guerrero, for whom Galarraga became a voice of experience. He saw action in a few games, hitting one HR ‚Äî the 399th and final home run of Galarraga‚Äòs storied big league career. =New York Mets (2005)= Galarraga (right) with the Mets during spring training in 2005 In , Galarraga again found himself with a new team, the New York Mets, who had invited him to spring training, not knowing if the 43-year-old would be a good fit for their roster. Galarraga showed that he had some gas left in the tank offensively by socking 3 home runs, but appeared very tentative on the defensive end. Galarraga eventually retired during spring training on March 29, 2005, saying it was \\"the right time to give a younger guy a chance to play.\\" He finished his career with a .288 batting average, 399 HR, and 1,425 RBI. Falling just one home run short of 400 career home runs, Galarraga ranked #36 all-time at the time of his retirement. Post-career=Hall of Fame consideration= Galarraga became eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010. He received 4.1% of the votes on the annual sportswriters‚Äô ballot; due to having received less than 5% of the votes Galarraga was removed from subsequent annual voting. Personal life Galarraga currently resides in West Palm Beach, Florida.

Life and career Legar√© was born in Charleston, South Carolina, of Huguenot and Scottish ancestry. Partly due to his inability to share in the amusements of his fellows, as a result of a vaccine-related deformity suffered before he was five that permanently stunted the growth and development of his legs; Legar√© was an eager student and was president of the Clariosophic Society at the College of South Carolina (now University of South Carolina at Columbia), from which he graduated in 1814 with the highest rank in his class and with a reputation for scholarship and eloquence. After graduation, he studied the law for three years, did advanced work in Paris and Edinburgh in 1818 and 1819 and in 1822 was admitted to the South Carolina bar. After practicing for a time in Charleston, he became a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives, serving between 1820 and 1821 and then again between 1824 and 1830. He also founded and edited the Southern Review between 1828 and 1832. From 1830 until 1832 he was the Attorney General of South Carolina, and he supported states' rights, he strongly opposed nullification. He was Attorney General until he was appointed charg√© d'affaires to Brussels in 1832, serving there until 1836. On his return he was elected to the 25th Congress as a Democrat, but failed in a re-election bid the following term. In 1841 President John Tyler named him Attorney General of the United States and he served in that office until his death. He also served as Secretary of State ad interim from May 8, 1843, until his death. He died in Boston while attending ceremonies for the unveiling of the Bunker Hill Monument. He was first interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was later re-interred in Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston. The USCGC Legare, which is a medium endurance cutter, was named in his honor.

Early life Peter (Pedro) Francisco, born July 9, 1760. Birth Certificate from the church at the town of Porto Judeu, Terceira Island, Azores, Portugal Francisco's origins are shrouded in mystery. It is believed he was born on July 9, 1760, at Porto Judeu, on the island of Terceira, in the Archipelago of the Azores, Portugal. In the case of the origin of his identification with the child named Pedro Francisco, his parents, Luiz Francisco Machado and Ant√≥nia Maria, natives of mainland Portugal (then an empire under the government of the Marquis of Pombal), a relatively wealthy and noble family, settled on the Island of Terceira (where he was born), distancing themselves more from personal or political enemies in the continent. According to the traditional version of his biography,Other versions hold that Francisco was taken to Ireland; as a youth, he became indentured to a sea captain, and traveled with him to City Point. Found abandoned, he was put in the poorhouse until taken in by Judge Winston. This version does not support the generally accepted dates given for Francisco's birth and transport; it is considered legend. he was found at about age five on the docks at City Point, Virginia, in 1765, and was taken to the Prince George County Poorhouse. Not speaking English, he repeated the name \\"Pedro Francisco\\". The locals called him Peter. They soon discovered the boy spoke Portuguese and noted his clothing was of good quality. When able to communicate, Pedro said that he had lived in a mansion near the ocean. His mother spoke French and his father spoke another language which he did not know. He and his sister were kidnapped from the grounds, but his sister escaped, while Francisco was bound and taken to a ship. Historians believe it is possible that the kidnappers intended to hold the children for ransom or that they had intended to sell them as indentured servants at their destination port in North America, but changed their minds. The Azorean legend says the Francisco family had many political enemies and set up Peter's abduction to protect him from accident or death by his parents' foes. Peter was soon taken in by the judge Anthony Winston of Buckingham County, Virginia, an uncle of Patrick Henry. Francisco lived with Winston and his family until the beginning of the American Revolution and was tutored by them. When he was old enough to work, he was apprenticed as a blacksmith, a profession chosen because of his massive size and strength (he grew to be six feet and eight inches in height, or 203 centimeters, and weigh some 500 pounds, or 227 kilograms, especially large at the time). It was also noted that his hair may have turned silver at an early age. He was well known as the Virginian Hercules or the Virginia Giant. American Revolutionary War At the age of 16, Francisco joined the 10th Virginia Regiment in 1776, and soon gained notoriety for his size and strength. He fought with distinction at numerous engagements, including the Battle of Brandywine in September. He fought a few skirmishes under Colonel Daniel Morgan, before transferring to the regiment of Colonel John Mayo of Powhatan. In October, Francisco rejoined his regiment and fought in the Battle of Germantown, and also appeared with the troops at Fort Mifflin on Port Island in the Delaware River. Francisco was hospitalized at Valley Forge for two weeks following these skirmishes. On June 28, 1778, he fought at Monmouth Court House, New Jersey, where a musket ball tore through his right thigh. He never fully recovered from this wound, but fought at Cowpens and other battles. Francisco was part of General \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne's attack on the British fort of Stony Point on the Hudson River. Upon attacking the fort, Francisco suffered a nine-inch gash in his stomach, but continued to fight; he was second to enter the fort. He killed twelve British grenadiers and captured the enemy flag. Francisco's entry into the fort is mentioned in Wayne's report on the battle to General Washington, dated July 17, 1779, and in a letter written by Captain William Evans to accompany Francisco's letter to the Virginia General Assembly in November 1820 for pay. As a result of being among the second man to enter the fort, he received 200 dollars. Following the Battle of Camden, South Carolina, Francisco noticed the Americans were leaving behind one of their valuable cannons, mired in mud. Legend says he freed and picked up the approximately 1,100-pound cannon and carried it on his shoulder to keep it from falling into the hands of the enemy. In a letter Francisco wrote to the Virginia General Assembly on November 11, 1820, he said that at Camden, he had shot a grenadier who had tried to shoot Colonel Mayo. He escaped by bayoneting one of Banastre Tarleton's cavalrymen and fled on the horse making cries to make the British think he was a Loyalist. The horse was later given to Mayo.\\"Letter of Peter Francisco to the General Assembly\\", William And Mary Quarterly historical magazine, Jamestown, VA: William and Mary College, 1905, pp. 217‚Äì219 Monument to Francisco, Guilford Courthouse National Military Park Hearing that Colonel William Washington was headed on a march through the Carolinas, Francisco joined him, seeing action at Guilford Courthouse, North Carolina. He allegedly killed eleven men on the field of battle, including one who wounded him severely in the thigh with a bayonet. In his own words, Francisco was \\"seen to kill two men, besides making many other panes [sic] which were doubtless fatal to others.\\" The feat is commemorated with a monument to Francisco at the National Military Park. =Francisco's Fight= Tarleton's British cavalry (1814 engraving) Francisco was sent home to Buckingham, Virginia to recuperate. He volunteered to spy on Tarleton and his horsemen, who were operating in the area. On this journey, he performed his best-known action: Francisco's Fight. He claimed to have defeated a band of Tarleton's Raiders and escaped with their horses. Legend has it that he killed or mortally wounded three of the eleven raiders. One night, nine of Tarleton's men surrounded Francisco outside of a tavern and ordered him to be arrested. They told him to give over his silver shoe buckles. Francisco told Tarleton's men to take the buckles themselves. When they began to seize his shoe buckles, Francisco took a soldier's saber and struck him on the head. The wounded soldier fired his pistol, grazing Francisco's side; Francisco nearly cut off the soldier's hand. Another enemy soldier aimed a musket at Francisco, but the musket misfired. Francisco grabbed it from the soldier's hands, knocked him off his mount, and escaped with the horse. However, in his 1820 letter to the Virginia legislature, Francisco reported having killed one and wounded eight of the nine raiders, and captured eight of their nine horses. In a brief 1829 petition to the United States Congress, he claimed to have dispatched or killed three Tarleton raiders and frightened the other six away while capturing eight of their horses. Francisco was ordered by his commanding officer to join the army in 1781 at Yorktown; he did not fight but was a witness to the British surrender. Later years Following Cornwallis' surrender at Yorktown, Francisco pursued his basic education. He went to school with young children, who were fascinated by his stories of the war. Legends of Francisco's strength abounded during his lifetime. Marriage and family In December 1784, Peter married Susannah Anderson of Cumberland County, Virginia. She was the daughter of Captain James Anderson and his wife Elizabeth Tyler Baker Anderson. The Andersons were of social distinction and owned a plantation called \\"The Mansion.\\" Peter and Susannah had two children: a son, James Anderson, born in the log house in 1786; and a daughter, Polly, born in 1788. Peter sold the 250 acres on Louse Creek in 1788. His wife Susannah died in 1790 of dysentery. In December 1794, Peter married Catherine Fauntleroy Brooke, who was a relative of his first wife, and they moved to Peter's home in Cumberland. Peter and Catherine had four children: Susan Brooke Francisco (born 1796), Benjamin M. Francisco (born 1803), Peter II, and Catherine Fauntleroy Francisco. After she died in 1821, he married in July 1823 for the third time, to Mary Grymes West. Death In his later years Francisco was poor and rather large, and had petitioned Congress and the Virginia legislature for a pension. He spent the last three years of his life working as the Sergeant-at-Arms to the Virginia State Senate. He died of appendicitis, January 16, 1831 and was buried with full military honors in Shockoe Hill Cemetery in Richmond. The Virginia state legislature adjourned for the day, and many legislators attended his funeral.

It was the temporary home of the expansion Houston Colt .45s for their first three seasons (1962‚Äì1964) while the Astrodome was being built, just to the south of it. After its use in Houston, it was dismantled and moved for use in two Mexican cities. Houston The stadium consisted of an uncovered one-level grandstand, stretching from foul pole to foul pole, with small bleacher stands in right and left field. One baseball annual published just before the season referred to it as \\"a barn-like thing.\\" It is best remembered for the horribly hot and humid weather (and attendant mosquito population) that had necessitated building the first domed stadium. The field was conventionally aligned northeast (home to center field) at an elevation of above sea level. Temporary from the outset, the stadium was abandoned when the Astrodome was completed for the 1965 season. The Astros occasionally used it for running and exercising to acclimatize players to warm weather before a road trip. However, the players had to be careful, as rattlesnakes would often take up residence on the field. Monsanto engineers also used it as a testing ground for its synthetic ChemGrass, later known as AstroTurf, inviting cars and horses to ride on the synthetic surface to gauge its durability. It sat abandoned for ten years, accumulating random odds and ends from nearby Astroworld and weathering in the blistering Texas sun. The right field corner of the stadium was located in what is now the northwest corner of NRG Center. Much of the northern half of the stadium (center field, left field and the third base stands) is occupied by a power station, and home plate was approximately located where a light pole in the adjacent parking lot is. =No-hitters= The stadium was the site of two no-hitters, both thrown by Houston, but the visitors scored in both and one was a Colts' loss. In 1963, Don Nottebart shut down the Philadelphia Phillies on May 17, but an error in the fifth inning and two sacrifices scored a run for the visitors; Houston won, The following year, Knuckleball thrower Ken Johnson kept the Cincinnati Reds hitless on April 23, but an unearned run scored by Pete Rose in the ninth broke a scoreless tie and the Reds won, With one out, Rose bunted and reached second on Johnson's throwing error, advanced to third on a fielder's choice, and scored after another =Low attendance= Against the hapless New York Mets late in both teams' first season, only 1,638 attended the first game of a doubleheader on Saturday, September 8, 1962. Colt Stadium junkyard, February 18, 1973 Season totals *1962: 924,456 (7th of 10 NL teams) *1963: 719,502 (10th of 10) *1964: 725,773 (10th of 10) The three seasons combined to 2,369,731; the first season at the Astrodome drew 2,151,470 in 1965. Mexico=Torre√≥n= By the early 1970s, Colt Stadium had become a county tax liability, with a lien on it. In 1971, it was sold to the owners of the Algodoneros del Uni√≥n Laguna, a Mexican League team, and was dismantled and shipped in pieces over the next four years to Torre√≥n, Coahuila, Mexico, for use as the team's home venue. Renamed Estadio Superior in a naming rights deal with a beer sponsor, Uni√≥n Laguna used the stadium between 1975 and 1981. It was located near the Estadio Corona soccer stadium on land used today for a soft drink company. The stadium was popularly known as the Estadio Mecano or Mill√≥n de Tuercas (Million Screws) due to its ability to be assembled and its resemblance to an Erector set. =Tampico= In 1981, the owner of Uni√≥n Laguna, Juan Abusaid R√≠os, had a falling out with Governor of Coahuila Jos√© de las Fuentes. Abusaid sold the team to the Sindicato de Trabajadores Petroleros de la Rep√∫blica Mexicana (Union of Oil Workers of the Mexican Republic), which moved the franchise to Tampico, Tamaulipas. While the stadium was taken down in Torre√≥n and moved to Tampico, the franchise spent the 1982 season in Monclova, Coahuila as the Astros de Monclova. In 1983, the Astros became the Astros de Tamaulipas, playing three full seasons at the stadium, known in Tampico as the Estadio √Ångel Castro. The franchise moved again after the 1985 season, this time without the stadium. The Mexico City Tigers bought the stadium with the intent of moving it yet again to serve as the club's new home, but with the venue already showing structural weakness after years in the humid Tampico climate, the plans were scuttled. Ultimately, some rows of seats were reassembled at a ballfield in Pasteje, Jocotitl√°n, State of Mexico, and the others remained in a Tampico playground until that, too, was demolished. El Mecano became the only major league ballpark to be sent down to the minors and the only one to play host to three professional teams in two nations.

Early life He was born in Alton, Hampshire (fifteen miles northeast of Winchester), in England on December 10, 1741. His father was an Anglican and his mother a Presbyterian, both strict Calvinists, and his home life was attended by religious severity. In 1751 the family settled near Cork, Ireland. In 1760 Murray returned to England and joined George Whitefield's congregation; but embracing, somewhat later, the Universalistic teachings of Welsh minister James Relly he was excommunicated. In 1770 he emigrated to \\"lose himself in America\\", and preached, as a Universalist minister, his first sermon in Good Luck, now Lacey Township, New Jersey, September 30, 1770, residing there with his patron and friend Thomas Potter until 1774, itinerating from Virginia to New Hampshire. Today the Potter farm is the site of the Murray Grove Retreat and Renewal Center . Mature life In 1774, he settled at Gloucester, Massachusetts and established a congregation there out of a Rellyite study group. There he met his second wife, the author and philosopher Judith Sargent Murray. He was suspected of being a British spy, but in 1775 was appointed chaplain of the Rhode Island Brigade before Boston by General George Washington despite petitions for his dismissal by other chaplains over his rejection of belief in hell. He participated in the first general Universalist Convention at Oxford, Massachusetts, September, 1785. On October 23, 1793, he became pastor of the Universalist society of Boston, and faithfully served it until October 19, 1809, when paralysis stopped his work. He was a man of great courage and eloquence, and in the defense of his views endured much detestation and abuse. In regard to Jesus, he taught that in him God became the Son; for \\"God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, are no more than different exhibitions of the self-same existent, omnipresent Being.\\" He taught that all men would ultimately be saved through the sacrifice of Christ, the basis for this being the union of all men in Christ, just as they were united with Adam, and therefore partaking of the benefits of his sacrifice. He was also a writer of hymns and a compiler of hymnals. Murray suffered a debilitating stroke on October 19, 1809, which compelled him to give up preaching and died in Boston, Massachusetts on September 3, 1815. His wife, Judith Sargent Murray, collected and finished his autobiography to publish posthumously. Murray is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge and Watertown, MA. Writings Sources are his own Letters and Sketches of Sermons, 3 volumes, Boston, 1812; Autobiography, continued by his wife, (also known as Life of Murray), Boston, 1816, centenary ed., 1870. Additional information and detailed writings from the letters of his wife Judith Sargent Murray were published in 1998 (edited by Bonnie Hurd Smith), in the book \\"From Gloucester to Philadelphia in 1790\\" with \\"Observations, anecdotes and thoughts from the 18th century letters of Judith Sargent Murray\\". This publication describes the life of the Murray family as they traveled in 1790, with the majority of time in Philadelphia.

Origin of term The term was popularized by William Gibson in his short story \\"Burning Chrome\\", which also introduced the term cyberspace, and in his subsequent novel Neuromancer. According to the Jargon File, as well as Gibson's own acknowledgements, the term ICE was originally coined by Tom Maddox. Description of ICE  When viewed in a cyberspace virtual reality environment, these constructs are often represented by actual walls of ice, stone, or metal. Black ICE refers to ICE that are capable of killing the intruder if deemed necessary or appropriate; some forms of black ICE may be artificially intelligent. Real-world usage Though real-life firewalls, anti-virus software and similar programs fall under this classification, the term has little real world significance and remains primarily a science fiction concept. This can be attributed to the fact that using the term \\"electronics\\" to describe software products (such as firewalls) is something of a misnomer. On the other hand, there is a strong connection between real-world cybercrime and cyberpunk literature. \\"The Gibsonian concept of cyberspace [...] fed back into both computer and information systems design and theory,\\" wrote Roger Burrows. The term ICE has occasionally been used for real-world software: * BlackICE, an intrusion detection system built by a California company named Network ICE in 1999, acquired by IBM Internet Security Systems, then discontinued in 2007. * The ICE cipher, an encryption algorithm, may be inspired by Gibson's ICE, but it is explained as meaning \\"Information Concealment Engine\\". On April 28, 2009, the Information and Communications Enhancement Act, or ICE Act for short, was introduced to the United States Senate by Senator Tom Carper to make changes to the handling of information security by the federal government, including the establishment of the National Office for Cyberspace. Usage in fiction The term ICE is widely used in cyberpunk fiction. =Anime= * Cyber City Oedo 808 * Ghost in the Shell, where ICE is referred to directly by name or else as an 'Offensive Firewall'. =Cartoons= * Phantom 2040, though in it \\"ICE\\" stands for \\"Integrated Cyber Environment\\", referring to cyberspace, rather than Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics =Card games= * Netrunner, where the corporate player uses ICE and the runner player uses icebreakers; while corps in Netrunner understand ICE to be an acronym for \\"Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics\\", the runner viewpoint is that the acronym should be for \\"Insidious Cortical Electrocution\\" * Android: Netrunner, an adaptation of the original Netrunner, formerly a Living Card Game. * Hacker and Hacker II - The Dark Side, where the players attempt to gain illicit access systems represented by playing cards arranged in a network while avoiding getting zapped by ICE and Black ICE. =Literature= * Neuromancer, original popularizer of the term * Count Zero the second novel of William Gibson's \\"Sprawl trilogy\\" * Hyperion, wherein black ICE is used to defend the TechnoCore * Trouble and Her Friends by Melissa Scott, wherein IC(E) refers to Intrusion Countermeasures (Electronic), solving the problem of implying that the measures are hardware-based =Roleplaying games= * Cyberpunk 2020, upon which the Netrunner card game is based * GURPS Cyberpunk * Shadowrun, called IC (The setting drops the \\"electronics\\" misnomer) but is colloquially named \\"Ice\\" by hackers in the setting. =Movies= * Johnny Mnemonic, mentioned in the opening crawl. * Track Down, wherein a friend of Kevin Mitnick says in a club that he is the hacker known as \\"IceBreaker\\" =Television= * Babylon 5, in the episode \\"Born to the Purple\\" * Max Headroom, in the episode \\"Security Systems\\", April 21, 1987 =Video games= * Anarchy Online features an item called \\"Hacker ICE-Breaker Source\\", which can be further upgraded to \\"Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics Upgrade\\". * BloodNet uses the term to describe the technology the player must overcome when hacking a computer system. * Deus Ex, where the player's hacking program is referred to as an \\"ICE Breaker\\" * Dystopia, wherein there are security programs called \\"ICE walls\\" * Mr. Robot, where \\"ICE\\" in its RPG part refers to shields or armor that can be attacked by various \\"ICE breaker\\"s * Neuromancer, where ICE, BlackICE, and ICE Breaking are highly featured. * Perfect Dark Zero, where players use ICE technology to bypass security. * Project Snowblind, features an ICE pick, to hack enemy cameras, turrets, and robots and use them against enemy forces. * Ripper has the player break into various cyberspace systems, which involves fighting the \\"ICE\\" security programs in the form of a rail shooter. * Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, an item called \\"ICE Breaker\\" can be obtained and used as a hacking tool during a sequence on the Leviathan, in which the player chooses one character to remain behind and attempt to rescue the other captured party members. * StarCrawlers features an ability called Black Ice, which the Hacker character may use. * System Shock, where ICE is represented in cyberspace as both autonomous security programs and ICE protection attached to data or software objects appearing as blue crystal formations. * System Shock 2, where an item that auto-hacks electronics is known as an \\"ICE-Pick\\" =Web Comics= * Schlock Mercenary, icewalls are a standard security measure.

Barnes was elected the party's national secretary in 1972, replacing the retiring Farrell Dobbs. He joined the SWP in the early 1960s as a student at Carleton College in Minnesota and quickly became a leading member of the party's youth wing. From the 1990s to the present, Barnes has directed his party to support the governments of North Korea and Equatorial Guinea; has instructed the party to abstain from antiwar or anti-racist activism; and in January 2016 lent his support to the occupation of federal lands, in Oregon, by militia movement members.Oregon actions demand ‚ÄòFree Hammonds,‚Äô open land use, The Militant Barnes was a key advocate of the party's \\"turn to industry\\" in the 1970s, its exit from the Fourth International in the 1980s and its orientation towards the Cuban Communist Party in the 1990s. Turn to Industry Barnes was one of the central organizers for the idea that the party should \\"turn to industry\\". In 1978 the party's National Committee approved a report by Barnes which argued that \\"we must subordinate everything else to immediately organizing to get a large majority of the membership of the SWP into industry and the industrial trade unions\\". SWP members took up union jobs in basic industries such as meatpacking, steel, mining and textile industries. Work within these industries became a condition of membership in the SWP, as the party attempted to penetrate the portions of the working class that it feels will be most combative and open to communist ideas in the future: those unionized in basic industries. Party members organized within these unions form factions within the party. The SWP asserts that this course follows the continuity of the communist movement from Marx and Engels to Lenin's time, which stresses a party based in the working class. Break with FI and Permanent Revolution Barnes's article \\"Their Trotsky and Ours\\" also underpinned the party's decisions in the 1980s to abandon its support for Leon Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution, and its withdrawal from the world Trotskyist movement and the reunified Fourth International. Barnes repudiated the traditional Trotskyist understanding of Permanent Revolution in favor of Lenin's pre-World War I position of \\"democratic-dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry\\", and a highly sympathetic view of the governments of Cuba, Nicaragua and Grenada. The change prefaced the expulsion of more than a third of the party's members in 1983 and 1984, and was regarded by the opposition as a complete break with the party's traditions.See George Breitman in the introduction to Don't Strangle the Party. As national secretary, Barnes played a key role in the expulsion those who supported the USFI. In 1990, he wrote on behalf of the SWP to withdraw it from close relations with the Fourth International and to recognize the reality that it was now part of a \\"Pathfinder tendency\\" consisting of the SWP and several Communist Leagues in other countries. Orientation to the Cuban CP Barnes has encouraged the SWP's growing interest in the Cuban Communist Party. In the 1960s he was a leader of the Fair Play for Cuba movement. This interest continues, and he wrote a 2001 book titled Cuba and the Coming American Revolution. The SWP views the Cuban Revolution and the Cuban Communist Party more sympathetically than do some other currents of the Trotskyist tradition, stressing the alleged vanguard role of Cuba's foreign policy and what socialists can learn from Cuba about building a socialist society.

It was colloquially known as Tarleton's Raiders, the Green Horse, and the Green Dragoons, after the British officer who led most of its day-to-day activities, Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton, and the green uniform coats of its officers. \\"Legion\\" was an 18th-century term for a military unit the size of a regiment, but consisting of infantry and cavalry, or infantry, cavalry, and artillery, all under one command, to make it more flexible for scouting or irregular operations than a regiment, which consisted of infantry or cavalry alone. Regiment formed This unit was raised in New York in July 1778 by Sir Henry Clinton\\"Oatmeal for the Foxhounds\\" website, http://www.banastretarleton.org in order to merge several small Loyalist units into a single force, a \\"legion\\" that combined infantry and cavalry forces and a battery of \\"flying\\" (light and fast moving) artillery. The infantry consisted of the Caledonian Volunteers, a partially mounted and partially foot unit raised in Philadelphia in late 1777 and early 1778, Ritzema's Royal American Reformers, the West Jersey Volunteers, and some members of the Roman Catholic Volunteers.\\"The King's Men: Loyalist Military Units in the American Revolution\\", https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/4171/kingsmen_03.htm&date;=2009-10-25+05:57:57 The cavalry combined, in whole or in part, elements of Captain Kinloch's independent troop of New York Dragoons, the Philadelphia Light Dragoons, Emmerich's Chasseurs, the Prince of Wales' American Volunteers, and the 16th Light Dragoons. The regiment was commanded by William, Lord Cathcart, as colonel; Banastre Tarleton was commissioned as lieutenant colonel. Once the unit left New York, Tarleton took full operational command. The Legion's peak operational strength was approximately 250 cavalry and 200 infantry.Babits, page 46, ‚ÄúBritish Legion Infantry strength at Cowpens was between 200 and 271 enlisted men‚Äù. However, this statement is referenced to a note on pages 175‚Äì176, which says, ‚ÄúThe British Legion infantry at Cowpens is usually considered to have had about 200‚Äì250 men, but returns for the 25 December 1780 muster show only 175. Totals obtained by Cornwallis, dated 15 January, show that the whole legion had 451 men, but approximately 250 were dragoons‚Äù. There would therefore appear to be no evidence for putting the total strength of the five British Legion Light Infantry companies at more than 200. The Legion in the Carolinas Campaign Elements of the Legion fought at the Siege of Savannah in 1779. The Legion as a whole was part of the British force that besieged and captured Charleston in 1780. The regiment participated in many battles in Clinton's South Carolina campaign, defeating General Isaac Huger and Lieutenant Colonel William Washington at Monck's Corner, dispersing another American force at Lenud's Ferry, and routing a column under the hapless Colonel Abraham Buford at the controversial Waxhaw massacre.From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South, Henry Lumpkin, Paragon House, 1981. During 1780, the Legion received reinforcements in the form of more drafts from Emmerich's Chasseurs and the Prince of Wales' American Volunteers and the permanent attachment of the Bucks County Dragoons. After Lord Cornwallis took command of the southern Crown forces, the Legion participated in his defeat of General Horatio Gates at the Battle of Camden, nearly caught Thomas Sumter at Fishing Creek, were hit by a surprise attack at Wahab's Plantation, and was pinned by a rebel force at Charlotte, until the remainder of the British force could come up. Throughout the autumn of 1780, the British Legion took part in anti-guerrilla operations, attempting to hunt down Francis Marion and Thomas Sumter and engaging in combat at Fishdam Ford and Blackstock's. The Legion seized and destroyed property in punitive attempts to suppress support for the guerrillas. In January 1781, the Legion was part of the force under Tarleton defeated by Daniel Morgan at the Battle of Cowpens. The regiment suffered heavily in this action, particularly its infantry arm. After Cowpens, the remaining Legion infantry either transferred to the cavalry or joined the garrison of Charleston.British Legion Biographical Sketches, Cavalry Officers, Donald J. Gara, reprinted at the On- Line Institute for Advanced Loyalist Studies, http://www.royalprovincial.com/military/rhist/britlegn/blcav1.htm From this point forward, the active British Legion was a cavalry force only. After regrouping, the regiment led Cornwallis' movement into North Carolina in search of the American army under Nathanael Greene, seeing action at Cowan's Ford and Tarrant's Tavern. The Legion was taken onto the American Establishment on March 7, 1781, as the 5th American Regiment.Encyclopaedia of British Provincial, and German Army Units 1775-1783, Phillip Katcher, Stackpole Books, 1973, p.83 This made them an official part of the British Army, rather than provincial (local) troops. On 15 March, the regiment fought at the Battle of Guilford Court House. The Legion in the Virginia Campaign As Cornwallis shifted his communications to the Chesapeake and abandoned the Carolinas for Virginia, the British Legion cavalry under Tarleton raided ahead of the British army, nearly capturing Virginia Governor Thomas Jefferson and the Virginia General Assembly at Charlottesville. The Legion again engaged in widespread destruction to punish rebel sympathizers and deny material support to the Continental Army and government. In July 1781 a skirmish, Francisco's Fight, took place between Peter Francisco and several of Tarleton's Raiders. When Cornwallis occupied Yorktown, the Legion was posted across the York River at Gloucester. It later fought a skirmish with French troops there and surrendered to the French at the conclusion of the siege.Christopher Ward, The War of the Revolution: Volume Two, The Macmillan Company, 1952, p.894-895 Lord Cornwallis sought terms of surrender that would have ensured no reprisals against the Loyalists in his army, but Washington refused to agree to them.Thomas H. Raddall, Tarleton's Legion, Collections of the Nova Scotia Historical Society, 1949, http://www.mersey.ca/tarletonslegion.html Some of the men of the Legion were evacuated, sent with Cornwallis' dispatches to New York after the surrender. Some officers were paroled. Some enlisted men, and at least four officers who volunteered to stay with their troopers, were sent to a prison camp in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Regiment disbanded and resettled in British Canada On December 25, 1782, the regiment was taken onto the British Establishment, suggesting that there may have been some thought to maintain the regiment as part of the postwar Army. The infantry of the Legion still in Charleston, and such of the regiment as had escaped to New York, were eventually evacuated to Nova Scotia in 1783.British Legion Biographical Sketches, Infantry Officers, Donald J. Gara, reprinted at the On- Line Institute for Advanced Loyalist Studies, http://www.royalprovincial.com/military/rhist/britlegn/blinf1.htm Some officers transferred to other regiments of the British Army. The British Legion was disbanded on October 10, 1783. Most of those discharged settled in Nova Scotia.

Federal Aviation Administration. Effective May 31, 2012. on the North Shore of Oahu in the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is operated by the Hawaii Department of Transportation under a 25-year lease from the United States Army. The airport is primarily used for gliding and sky diving operations, and also houses Civil Air Patrol (CAP) glider aircraft. Military operations consist largely of night operations for night vision device training and orientation flights for the United States Air Force Auxiliary (CAP). This airport is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017‚Äì2021, in which it is categorized as a basic general aviation facility. History Dillingham Airfield soon after construction during World War II A communications station called Camp Kawaihapai was established here in 1922 on along the Oahu Railway and Land Company line. In the 1920s and 1930s, the railroad transported mobile coast artillery to the site. By 1941, the Army leased additional land and established Mokulƒìia Airstrip. Curtiss P-40 fighters were deployed at North Shore airstrips at Kahuku, Haleiwa and Mokulƒìia when the attack on Pearl Harbor took place. Aircraft taking off from nearby Haleiwa destroyed several attacking aircraft. The runway was paved, extended to long, and a crosswind runway added from 1942-1945. By the end of World War II, Mokulƒìia Airfield could handle B-29 Superfortress bombers. In 1946, the Army acquired an additional . In 1948, the airfield was inactivated and renamed Dillingham Air Force Base in memory of Captain Henry Gaylord Dillingham, a B-29 airman who was killed in action over Kawasaki, Japan on July 25, 1945. Captain Dillingham was the son of Walter F. Dillingham and grandson of Benjamin Dillingham who founded the railroad which evolved into Hawaiian Dredging Company and the Dillingham Corporation. Nike missiles were installed in the 1950s, but were obsolete by 1970. In 1962, the State of Hawaii leased Dillingham for general aviation use. In the 1970s the base was transferred from the Air Force back to the Army. The state signed new leases with the Army in 1974 and 1983. In the 1980s, hangars, a control tower, and a fire station were built.  Facilities and aircraft  Dillingham Airfield covers an area of 134 acres (54 ha) at an elevation of 14.2 feet (4.3 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 8/26 with an asphalt surface measuring 9,007 by 75 feet (2,745 x 23 m). As a general aviation joint-use facility, the airfield has one runway, a UNICOM tower, powered aircraft and glider hangars, and a tie down area for recreation aircraft. Jet-A and Avgas are available in a self-serve facility utilizing credit cards for payment. There were plans to extend the taxiway to the end of the 26 runway, but funding was delayed. Air traffic, unless approved prior by the US Army, is limited to daytime operations by general aviation and sport parachuting operations. For the 12-month period ending June 30, 2015, the airport had 103 operators a day: 96% general aviation and 4% military. At that time there were 47 aircraft based at this airport: 24 single-engine, 20 glider, 1 helicopter, and 2 ultralight.

It is located five nautical miles (6 mi, 9 km) north of Lahaina, in Maui County. Most flights to Kapalua Airport originate from commuter airports on the other Hawaiian islands by commercial commuter services, unscheduled air taxis, and general aviation. As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 52,328 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 42,416 enplanements in 2009, and 40,060 in 2010. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017‚Äì2021, in which it is categorized as a general aviation facility.  History  Named for the Kapalua Resort a few miles to the north, the airport replaced the Kaanapali Airport, which had an even shorter runway, in 1987 to allow valuable coastal land to be developed. The airport code name JHM stands for John Henry Magoon, who was president of Hawaiian Airlines when that airline developed the airport. Hawaiian operated de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 turboprop aircraft on flights to Honolulu. The STOL capable, four engine, 50-passenger Dash 7 was the largest aircraft ever to operate scheduled passenger flights from the airport. Hawaiian discontinued service to Kapalua when the Dash 7 was retired from its fleet in 1994. Mahalo Air, which operated between 1993 and 1997, also served Kapalua with flights to Honolulu using ATR 42 twin turboprop aircraft. Island Air discontinued service to Kapalua on May 31, 2013 when it replaced its fleet of Dash-8 with ATR-72 aircraft. On November 2, 2016, Hawaiian Airlines announced they would resume service at Kapalua Airport beginning January 18, 2017 with flights to Honolulu and Kahului. Flights were to be operated by Hawaiian Air's Ohana by Hawaiian subsidiary utilizing 48-seat ATR 42-500 twin turboprop aircraft. On November 15, 2016, Hawaiian Airlines announced that it was temporarily suspending sales of its Honolulu to West Maui service pending securing a TSA presence at Kapalua Airport.

Like Galois connections, order embeddings constitute a notion which is strictly weaker than the concept of an order isomorphism. Both of these weakenings may be understood in terms of category theory.  Formal definition  Formally, given two partially ordered sets (posets) (S, \\\\leq) and (T, \\\\preceq), a function f: S \\\\to T is an order embedding if f is both order- preserving and order-reflecting, i.e. for all x and y in S, one has : x\\\\leq y \\\\text{ if and only if } f(x)\\\\preceq f(y).. Such a function is necessarily injective, since f(x) = f(y) implies x \\\\leq y and y \\\\leq x. If an order embedding between two posets S and T exists, one says that S can be embedded into T.  Properties  Mutual order embedding of (0,1) and [0,1], using f(x) = (94x+3)/100 in both directions. The set S of divisors of 6, partially ordered by x divides y. The embedding id: \\\\\\\\{ 1,2,3 \\\\\\\\} \\\\to S cannot be a coretraction. An order isomorphism can be characterized as a surjective order embedding. As a consequence, any order embedding f restricts to an isomorphism between its domain S and its range f(S), which justifies the term \\"embedding\\". On the other hand, it might well be that two (necessarily infinite) posets are mutually order-embeddable into each other without being order-isomorphic. An example is provided by the open interval (0,1) of real numbers and the corresponding closed interval [0,1]. The function f(x) = (94x+3) / 100 maps the former to the subset (0.03,0.97) of the latter and the latter to the subset [0.03,0.97]of the former, see picture. Ordering both sets in the natural way, f is both order-preserving and order-reflecting, as every affine function is. Yet, no isomorphism between the two posets can exist, since e.g. [0,1] has a least element, while (0,1) has not. For a similar example using arctan to order-embed the real numbers into an interval, and the identity map for the reverse direction, see e.g. Just and Weese (1996). A retract is a pair (f,g) of order-preserving maps whose composition g \\\\circ f is the identity. In this case, f is called a coretraction, and must be an order embedding.. However, not every order embedding is a coretraction. As a trivial example, the unique order embedding f: \\\\emptyset \\\\to \\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\} from the empty poset to a nonempty poset has no retract, because there is no order-preserving map g: \\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\} \\\\to \\\\emptyset. More illustratively, consider the set S of divisors of 6, partially ordered by x divides y, see picture. Consider the embedded sub- poset \\\\\\\\{ 1,2,3 \\\\\\\\}. A retract of the embedding id: \\\\\\\\{ 1,2,3 \\\\\\\\} \\\\to S would need to send 6 to somewhere in \\\\\\\\{ 1,2,3 \\\\\\\\} above both 2 and 3, but there is no such place.  Additional Perspectives  Posets can straightforwardly be viewed from many perspectives, and order embeddings are basic enough that they tend to be visible from everywhere. For example: * (Model theoretically) A poset is a set equipped with a (reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive) binary relation. An order embedding A -> B is an isomorphism from A to an elementary substructure of B. * (Graph theoretically) A poset is a (transitive, acyclic, directed, reflexive) graph. An order embedding A -> B is a graph isomorphism from A to an induced subgraph of B. * (Category theoretically) A poset is a (small, thin, and skeletal) category such that each homset has at most one element. An order embedding A -> B is a full and faithful functor from A to B which is injective on objects, or equivalently an isomorphism from A to a full subcategory of B.

He lives in California. Early life Jeff Stryker grew up in Springfield, Illinois. His father was a car salesman and his mother was a nurse. At age 13, he was sent to military school by his parents, who got a divorce while he was away. Pre- film career Jeff Stryker worked as a stripper and delivered balloon-o-grams before a local photographer sent shots of him to gay adult film director John Travis in California.\\"Jeff Stryker: Porn's Enigmatic Star\\", The Rialto Report, December 1, 2013 Film career and sexuality Stryker is primarily known as a performer in gay pornography films, although Jamie Loves Jeff was one of the biggest selling heterosexual adult movies of all time for its producer, Vivid Entertainment. He describes himself (in a somewhat joking fashion) as sexually \\"universal\\". He has also said, \\"I don‚Äôt define myself as anything.\\" He also tried acting, starring in a 1989 Italian-produced horror film called After Death (Revenge of the Zombies), in which he was credited as Chuck Peyton. Later in the American DVD release, the name Jeff Stryker was used as well. A trailer interview was added with Stryker's describing the experience he had while shooting this movie in Manila. Stryker also starred in the short film by German cult director Rosa von Praunheim Can I Be Your Bratwurst, Please? Stryker also appeared in a 1995 German television movie Der schwarze Fluch (Black Curse) starring James Brolin, as well as the 1988 Italian feature Dirty Love. Awards and tributes * AVN Hall of Fame inductee * GayVN Hall of Fame inductee * 2000 Grabby Wall of Fame inductee * 2004 Hustler Porn Walk of Fame * 1986 XRCO Best Actor (Gay) * Stryker was featured in a 1991 portrait by artists Pierre et Gilles. Merchandising The Jeff Stryker Cock and Balls, a dildo fashioned from a cast of his penis, is widely sold in sex stores. The dildo was academically analyzed in a paper presented at the 1995 Bowling Green State University Conference in Cultural Studies: Lesbian Pornography and Transformation: Foucault, Bourdieu, and de Certeau Make Sense of the Jeff Stryker Dildo, by Mary T. Conway, then a graduate student at Temple University. The sex toy is notable not only for being popular, but also as Stryker and the manufacturer of the item litigated for the rights to its likeness as part of Stryker's intellectual property. The case eventually reached a mutually acceptable resolution (see ). In a 1999 Salon article written by Jeff Stryker, a New York journalist and the porn actor's namesake, the dildo is even described as an object of higher culture. It was mentioned in Allan Gurganus' 1997 novel Plays Well with Others, where the novel's narrator cleans up a closet filled with dildos, the premium find being \\"a Jeff Stryker, a monster, but somehow Roman in its genial fluted civic beauty.\\" Stryker has released a compact disc (Wild Buck) of country music that he performed, and in his pornographic video Bigger Than Life, he performed a rock song of the same name. Reaction from other celebrities * Filmmaker and author John Waters called Jeff Stryker ‚Äúthe Cary Grant of porno.‚Äù * American comedian Margaret Cho's routines involve her love for his films. In her show, Assassin, she discusses in detail the many places one can use the dildo. Stryker had given Cho his commercially produced action figure. * In her autobiography, Traci Lords describes him as ‚Äúhandsome but rather dumb looking‚Äù after he gave her scornful looks backstage during a Century City Civic Center Thierry Mugler Fashion show. Legal battles Stryker later sued Health Devices Inc. and California Publishers Liquidating Corp. for over $1 million for breach of contract and piracy when they sold a bootleg dildo of his genitals without paying him sufficiently. The case was heard before a judge in Los Angeles, who eventually brokered a deal whereby the case was dismissed upon payment of $25,000 to Stryker and the return and right to reproduce all items which Stryker endorsed. Stryker has had arguments with Kulak's Woodshed, a folk-music nightclub, that is next door to his office. He claims that the club causes disturbance normally associated with large late-night urban venues: noise, drugs, unruly patrons, vandalism, graffiti, public urination and parking headaches. James Britton, who operates a floor covering business on the other side of the club, also complains that the club has damaged his business. In January 2009, the L.A. Weekly reported that Stryker blamed the nightclub for preventing him from completing his autobiography, as the noise and crowds disturbed his concentration. ‚Äú(My writing has) been put on perpetual hold until I can get myself back together,‚Äù he told the newspaper. ‚ÄúI got a $25,000 advance on (the book) but could never complete it.‚Äù But Paul Kulak counter claims (according to the L.A. Weekly) that Stryker has made threats to him and the club's customers: ‚ÄúHe constantly reminds me he‚Äôs a firearms expert and will hide behind his back door when I dump the trash. Once, he started making mechanical gun clicks. I could see he had a pistol in his hand as he was dry-firing it... I‚Äôm willing to risk my life to keep this [club] going.‚Äù Stryker responded to Kulak's claim and was quoted as saying, \\"That guy is so out there!\\"Mikulan, Steven. \\"The Porn Star's Revenge: Formerly Known as Jeff Stryker, Charles Peyton Has Turned His Toxic Feud Over the Folk- Music Club Kulak's Woodshed Into a Real-Life Online Obsession,\\" L.A.

GFS2 allows all members of a cluster to have direct concurrent access to the same shared block storage, in contrast to distributed file systems which distribute data throughout the cluster. GFS2 can also be used as a local file system on a single computer. GFS2 has no disconnected operating-mode, and no client or server roles. All nodes in a GFS2 cluster function as peers. Using GFS2 in a cluster requires hardware to allow access to the shared storage, and a lock manager to control access to the storage. The lock manager operates as a separate module: thus GFS2 can use the Distributed Lock Manager (DLM) for cluster configurations and the \\"nolock\\" lock manager for local filesystems. Older versions of GFS also support GULM, a server-based lock manager which implements redundancy via failover. GFS and GFS2 are free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.  History  Development of GFS began in 1995 and was originally developed by University of Minnesota professor Matthew O'Keefe and a group of students.OpenGFS Data sharing with a GFS storage cluster It was originally written for SGI's IRIX operating system, but in 1998 it was ported to Linux since the open source code provided a more convenient development platform. In late 1999/early 2000 it made its way to Sistina Software, where it lived for a time as an open-source project. In 2001, Sistina made the choice to make GFS a proprietary product. Developers forked OpenGFS from the last public release of GFS and then further enhanced it to include updates allowing it to work with OpenDLM. But OpenGFS and OpenDLM became defunct, since Red Hat purchased Sistina in December 2003 and released GFS and many cluster-infrastructure pieces under the GPL in late June 2004. Red Hat subsequently financed further development geared towards bug-fixing and stabilization. A further development, GFS2 derives from GFS and was included along with its distributed lock manager (shared with GFS) in Linux 2.6.19. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 included GFS2 as a kernel module for evaluation purposes. With the 5.3 update, GFS2 became part of the kernel package. , GFS forms part of the Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 and upwards and associated CentOS Linux distributions. Users can purchase commercial support to run GFS fully supported on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 5.3, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Advanced Platform has included support for GFS at no additional cost. The following list summarizes some version numbers and major features introduced: * v1.0 (1996) SGI IRIX only * v3.0 Linux port * v4 journaling * v5 Redundant Lock Manager * v6.1 (2005) Distributed Lock Manager * Linux 2.6.19 - GFS2 and DLM merged into Linux kernel * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 releases the first fully supported GFS2  Hardware  The design of GFS and of GFS2 targets SAN-like environments. Although it is possible to use them as a single node filesystem, the full feature-set requires a SAN. This can take the form of iSCSI, FibreChannel, AoE, or any other device which can be presented under Linux as a block device shared by a number of nodes, for example a DRBD device. The DLM requires an IP based network over which to communicate. This is normally just Ethernet, but again, there are many other possible solutions. Depending upon the choice of SAN, it may be possible to combine this, but normal practice involves separate networks for the DLM and storage. The GFS requires fencing hardware of some kind. This is a requirement of the cluster infrastructure, rather than GFS/GFS2 itself, but it is required for all multi-node clusters. The usual options include power switches and remote access controllers (e.g. DRAC, IPMI, or ILO). Fencing is used to ensure that a node which the cluster believes to be failed cannot suddenly start working again while another node is recovering the journal for the failed node. It can also optionally restart the failed node automatically once the recovery is complete.  Differences from a local filesystem  Although the designers of GFS/GFS2 aimed to emulate a local filesystem closely, there are a number of differences to be aware of. Some of these are due to the existing filesystem interfaces not allowing the passing of information relating to the cluster. Some stem from the difficulty of implementing those features efficiently in a clustered manner. For example: * The flock() system call on GFS/GFS2 is not interruptible by signals. * The fcntl() F_GETLK system call returns a PID of any blocking lock. Since this is a cluster filesystem, that PID might refer to a process on any of the nodes which have the filesystem mounted. Since the purpose of this interface is to allow a signal to be sent to the blocking process, this is no longer possible. * Leases are not supported with the lock_dlm (cluster) lock module, but they are supported when used as a local filesystem * dnotify will work on a \\"same node\\" basis, but its use with GFS/GFS2 is not recommended * inotify will also work on a \\"same node\\" basis, and is also not recommended (but it may become supported in the future) * splice is supported on GFS2 only The other main difference, and one that is shared by all similar cluster filesystems, is that the cache control mechanism, known as glocks (pronounced Gee-locks) for GFS/GFS2, has an effect across the whole cluster. Each inode on the filesystem has two glocks associated with it. One (called the iopen glock) keeps track of which processes have the inode open. The other (the inode glock) controls the cache relating to that inode. A glock has four states, UN (unlocked), SH (shared ‚Äì a read lock), DF (deferred ‚Äì a read lock incompatible with SH) and EX (exclusive). Each of the four modes maps directly to a DLM lock mode. When in EX mode, an inode is allowed to cache data and metadata (which might be \\"dirty\\", i.e. waiting for write back to the filesystem). In SH mode, the inode can cache data and metadata, but it must not be dirty. In DF mode, the inode is allowed to cache metadata only, and again it must not be dirty. The DF mode is used only for direct I/O. In UN mode, the inode must not cache any metadata. In order that operations which change an inode's data or metadata do not interfere with each other, an EX lock is used. This means that certain operations, such as create/unlink of files from the same directory and writes to the same file should be, in general, restricted to one node in the cluster. Of course, doing these operations from multiple nodes will work as expected, but due to the requirement to flush caches frequently, it will not be very efficient. The single most frequently asked question about GFS/GFS2 performance is why the performance can be poor with email servers. The solution is to break up the mail spool into separate directories and to try to keep (so far as is possible) each node reading and writing to a private set of directories.  Journaling  GFS and GFS2 are both journaled file systems; and GFS2 supports a similar set of journaling modes as ext3. In mode, only metadata is journaled. This is the only mode supported by GFS, however it is possible to turn on journaling on individual data-files, but only when they are of zero size. Journaled files in GFS have a number of restrictions placed upon them, such as no support for the mmap or sendfile system calls, they also use a different on-disk format from regular files. There is also an \\"inherit- journal\\" attribute which when set on a directory causes all files (and sub- directories) created within that directory to have the journal (or inherit- journal, respectively) flag set. This can be used instead of the mount option which ext3 supports (and GFS/GFS2 does not). GFS2 also supports mode which is similar to except that dirty data is synced before each journal flush is completed. This ensures that blocks which have been added to an inode will have their content synced back to disk before the metadata is updated to record the new size and thus prevents uninitialised blocks appearing in a file under node failure conditions. The default journaling mode is , to match ext3's default. , GFS2 does not yet support mode, but it does (unlike GFS) use the same on-disk format for both regular and journaled files, and it also supports the same journaled and inherit-journal attributes. GFS2 also relaxes the restrictions on when a file may have its journaled attribute changed to any time that the file is not open (also the same as ext3). For performance reasons, each node in GFS and GFS2 has its own journal. In GFS the journals are disk extents, in GFS2 the journals are just regular files. The number of nodes which may mount the filesystem at any one time is limited by the number of available journals.  Features of GFS2 compared with GFS  GFS2 adds a number of new features which are not in GFS. Here is a summary of those features not already mentioned in the boxes to the right of this page: * The metadata filesystem (really a different root) ‚Äì see Compatibility and the GFS2 meta filesystem below * GFS2 specific trace points have been available since kernel 2.6.32 * The XFS-style quota interface has been available in GFS2 since kernel 2.6.33 * Caching ACLs have been available in GFS2 since 2.6.33 * GFS2 supports the generation of \\"discard\\" requests for thin provisioning/SCSI TRIM requests * GFS2 supports I/O barriers (on by default, assuming underlying device supports it. Configurable from kernel 2.6.33 and up) * FIEMAP ioctl (to query mappings of inodes on disk) * Splice (system call) support * mmap/splice support for journaled files (enabled by using the same on disk format as for regular files) * Far fewer tunables (making set-up less complicated) * Ordered write mode (as per ext3, GFS only has writeback mode)  Compatibility and the GFS2 meta filesystem  GFS2 was designed so that upgrading from GFS would be a simple procedure. To this end, most of the on-disk structure has remained the same as GFS, including the big-endian byte ordering. There are a few differences though: * GFS2 has a \\"meta filesystem\\" through which processes access system files * GFS2 uses the same on-disk format for journaled files as for regular files * GFS2 uses regular (system) files for journals, whereas GFS uses special extents * GFS2 has some other \\"\\" system files * The layout of the inode is (very slightly) different * The layout of indirect blocks differs slightly The journaling systems of GFS and GFS2 are not compatible with each other. Upgrading is possible by means of a tool () which is run with the filesystem off-line to update the metadata. Some spare blocks in the GFS journals are used to create the (very small) files required by GFS2 during the update process. Most of the data remains in place. The GFS2 \\"meta filesystem\\" is not a filesystem in its own right, but an alternate root of the main filesystem. Although it behaves like a \\"normal\\" filesystem, its contents are the various system files used by GFS2, and normally users do not need to ever look at it. The GFS2 utilities mount and unmount the meta filesystem as required, behind the scenes.

His best known works include the song \\"Adiemus\\" and the Adiemus album series; Palladio; The Armed Man; and his Requiem. Jenkins was educated in music at Cardiff University and the Royal Academy of Music: of the latter, he is a fellow and an Associate. He joined the jazz-rock band Soft Machine in 1972 and became the groups lead songwriter in 1974. Jenkins continued to work with Soft Machine up to 1984 and has not been involved with any incarnation of the group since. Jenkins has composed music for advertisement campaigns and has won the industry prize twice. Early life and education Karl Jenkins was born and raised in Penclawdd, Gower, Wales. His mother was Swedish, and his father was Welsh. Jenkins received his initial musical instruction from his father, who was the local schoolteacher, chapel organist and choirmaster. He attended Gowerton Grammar School. Jenkins studied music at Cardiff University, and then commenced postgraduate studies in London at the Royal Academy of Music. Career overview=Early career: Graham Collier's group and Nucleus= For the bulk of his early career Jenkins was known as a jazz and jazz-rock musician, playing baritone and soprano saxophones, keyboards and oboe, an unusual instrument in a jazz context. He joined jazz composer Graham Collier's group and later co-founded the jazz-rock group Nucleus, which won first prize at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1970. =Soft Machine= In 1972 he joined the Canterbury progressive rock band Soft Machine. The group played venues including The Proms, Carnegie Hall, and the Newport Jazz Festival. The album Six, on which Jenkins first played with Soft Machine, won the Melody Maker British Jazz Album of the Year award in 1973. Jenkins also won the miscellaneous musical instrument section (as he did the following year). Soft Machine was voted best small group in the Melody Maker jazz poll of 1974. The albums in which Jenkins performed and composed were Six, Seven (1973), Bundles (1975), Softs (1976) and Land of Cockayne (1981). Jenkins composed most of the tracks on Seven and nearly all of the tracks on the subsequent three albums. After Mike Ratledge left the band in 1976, Soft Machine did not include any of its founding members, but kept recording on a project basis with line-ups revolving around Jenkins and drummer John Marshall. Although Melody Maker had positively reviewed the Soft Machine of 1973 and 1974, Hugh Hopper, involved with the group since replacing bassist Kevin Ayers in 1968, cited Jenkins's \\"third rate\\" musical involvement in his own decision to leave the band,Soft Machine: Out-Bloody-Rageous, Graham Bennett, 2008 () p. 246. and the band of the late 1970s has been described by band member John Etheridge as wasting its potential.Soft Machine: Out-Bloody- Rageous, Graham Bennett, 2008 () p. 324. = Other works= In November 1973, Jenkins and Ratledge participated in a live-in-the-studio performance of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells for the BBC. It is available on Oldfield's Elements DVD. Jenkins has created advertising music, twice winning the industry prize in that field. From the 1980s, he developed a relationship with Bartle Bogle Hegarty, starting with composing musics for their Levi's jeans \\"Russian\\" series. He composed a classical theme used by De Beers diamond merchants for their television advertising campaign focusing on jewellery worn by people otherwise seen only in silhouette. Jenkins later included this as the title track in a compilation called Diamond Music, and eventually created Palladio, using it as the theme of the first movement. Other arrangements have included advertisements for the Renault Clio. As a composer, his breakthrough came with the crossover project Adiemus. Jenkins has conducted the Adiemus project in Japan, Germany, Spain, Finland, the Netherlands, and Belgium, as well as London's Royal Albert Hall and Battersea Power Station. The Adiemus: Songs of Sanctuary (1995) album topped the classical album charts. It spawned a series of successors, each revolving around a central theme. In 2014 Jenkins released a tribute song for the 2014 Winter Olympics, performed by his new age music group also called Adiemus. Jenkins was the first international composer and conductor to conduct the University of Johannesburg Kingsway Choir led by Renette Bouwer, during his visit to South Africa as the choir performed his The Armed Man: A mass for peace together with a 70-piece orchestra. Jenkins' choral work The Peacemakers, features texts from Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela, Anne Frank and Mother Teresa, as well as words from the Bible and the Qur'an with some new text specially written by Terry Waite. On the 2012 record the London Symphony Orchestra is joined by different vocal forces including Rundfunkchor Berlin, the City of Birmingham Youth Chorus, and the 1000-strong \\"The Really Big Chorus\\" made up of members of UK choirs from across the country brought together in one day, in one studio, to contribute to two movements on the album. Guest artists include violinist Chlo√´ Hanslip, soprano Lucy Crowe, Davy Spillane on Uilleann pipes, Indian bansuri player Ashwin Srinivasan and jazz musicians Nigel Hitchcock and Laurence Cottle. The album was released on 26 March 2012. The world premiere of this seventeen-movement work took place, however, in New York City's Carnegie Hall on 16 January 2012. Jenkins conducted from the podium, and John H. Briggs, Sr. conducted the Children's Chorus from a seated position. Briggs was the Choral Arts Conductor of one of the participating schools and its two choruses: Il Bel Canto and Die Meistersingers of Gwynn Park Middle School, Maryland. Additional concerts in the UK and US took place later in the year. Album cover of The Bards of Wales (2012) Jenkins composed the music for the 2012 BBC Wales series The Story of Wales presented by Huw Edwards. A work entitled The Healer ‚Äì A Cantata For St Luke was premiered on 16 October 2014 (7:30 pm) in St Luke's Church, Grayshott, Hampshire, and was recorded and broadcast on Classic FM. The Healer received its US premiere at Carnegie Hall, New York on 19 January 2015. In September 2015, the recording of the premiere of The Healer was released on CD by Warner Classics as part of the 8-disc boxed set Voices. A compilation CD Still with the Music was also released in September 2015, coinciding with the publication of his autobiography of the same name. On 8 October 2016 Jenkins' choral work Cantata Memoria: For the children, a response to the 1966 Aberfan disaster with a libretto by Mererid Hopwood and commissioned by S4C, premiered at the Wales Millennium Centre. The concert was broadcast the following evening on S4C and was released as an album by Deutsche Grammophon. Awards and achievements Jenkins holds a Doctorate in Music from the University of Wales. He has been made both a fellow and an associate of the Royal Academy of Music, and a room has been named in his honour. He also has had fellowships at Cardiff University (2005), the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama, Trinity College Carmarthen, and Swansea Metropolitan University. In 2008 Jenkins' The Armed Man was listed as No. 1 in Classic FM's \\"Top 10 by living composers\\". He was awarded an honorary doctorate in music from the University of Leicester, the Chancellor's Medal from the University of Glamorgan and honorary visiting professorships at Thames Valley University, London College of Music and the ATriUM, Cardiff. Jenkins was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2005 New Year Honours and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours. In 2015 he was made a Knight Bachelor.Metro, 13 June 2015.

Johnson has accompanied George Gruntz extensively. As a leader, he released three albums during the 1990s for Verve Records, the first Arrival, a tribute to Pharoah Sanders. Biography In the 1960s he worked with Charles Mingus, Hank Crawford, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Archie Shepp, and Hank Mobley on the album A Slice of the Top. He also began a long association with Gil Evans in 1966. He was arranger of a horn section that backed Taj Mahal on Mahal's 1971 live album, The Real Thing, which featured three other tubists/multi-instrumentalists, Bob Stewart, Joseph Daley and Earl McIntyre. Johnson also played with The Band on their Rock of Ages live album, The Last Waltz and into the late 2000s with The Band drummer, Levon Helm's Band. During the 1970s, he was the live band conductor of the Saturday Night Live Band; he can be seen in several musical numbers, including playing bass saxophone in the King Tut sketch. He has also led three tuba bands, collaborated with Tomasz Stanko, Substructure, Tuba Libre and GRAVITY, perhaps his best-known band. He has recorded frequently. In 1981 he performed at the Woodstock Jazz Festival, held in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Creative Music Studio. In 1984, he appeared as part of the Gil Evans Orchestra, accompanying Jaco Pastorius at the Live Under The Sky Festival in Japan. He had a minor role in the 1983 film, Eddie and the Cruisers as Wendell's replacement. He has also appeared in episodes of Matlock and Hill Street Blues. Johnson famously accompanied James Taylor in a performance of Jelly Man Kelly on Sesame Street in 1983, and also on tin whistle when Taylor sings to Oscar The Grouch.Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street; Chapter 15 Howard Johnson has two grown children, David and Nedra. David (1964‚Äì2009) was an actor in New York, and lived in Brooklyn. Nedra is an accomplished and respected blues singer and musician.

Economic cost is used mainly by economists as means to compare the prudence of one course of action with that of another. The factors to be taken into consideration are money, time, and other resources cost is the sum of explicit cost. The comparison includes the gains and losses precluded by taking a course of action as well as those of the course taken itself. Economic cost differs from accounting cost because it includes opportunity cost. (Some sources refer to accounting cost as explicit cost and opportunity cost as implicit cost.)

It runs generally from north to south from the Ogmore Vale and Gilfach Goch, past Bridgend and Ogmore. The River Ogmore rises at Craig Ogwr (527 m) in the Ogmore Valley as the Ogwr Fawr before it links with the Ogwr Fach at Blackmill. The River Llynfi, the River Garw and finally the River Ewenny in its estuary are all tributaries of the Ogmore which flows into the sea between Ogmore-by-Sea and the Merthyr Mawr sand-dunes.  Geology and geography  The Ogmore has two major branches in its headwaters: the which flows south through Nantymoel, Ogmore Vale and Lewistown; and joining it from the east the which flows through . After the confluence with the , they join to form the at Blackmill. The Ogmore and its tributaries were confined to narrow concrete channels to prevent flooding Most of the headwaters flow over carboniferous coal measures overlain by glacial drift and fluvial gravels. The valleys are reasonably broad for a small river, and many of the tributaries meandered through their valleys in the past. The considerable urbanisation, especially in the 19th century, confined most rivers to rather narrow artificial channels, bordered in places such as Bridgend with concrete flood protection walls. Major tributaries=River Llynfi= The River Llynfi (), runs for around 10 miles from its source north of Maesteg and flows generally southwards through the Llynfi Valley to the confluence with the River Ogmore at Aberkenfig.Ordnance Survey Explorer maps 151 'Cardiff & Bridgend/Caerdydd a Phen-y-bont-ar-Ogwr' and 166 'Rhondda & Merthyr Tydfil/Merthyr Tudful' =River Garw= The River Garw flows broadly north-south and runs through Pontycymer to its confluence with the Ogmore (Ogwr) at Brynmenyn. =River Ewenny= The river enters the Bristol Channel at Ogmore-by-Sea, at a popular beach called Traeth-yr-Afon. The Ewenny River () rises to the north-east of Bridgend town and flows through Pencoed and Coychurch before entering the River Ogmore estuary just below Ogmore Castle. Environment The industrialisation of the valley of the Ogmore by mining and heavy industry severely damaged much of the natural environment of the river. However, there has been an improvement in recent years and it supports a healthy population of aquatic invertebrates. The river does still have some problems though, including its proximity to major industrial plants, insensitive development and invasive weeds. Estuary Mouth of the River Ogmore. Until some years ago, the adjacent sewage works discharged effluents into the estuary, but the water outlets have since been treated with ultraviolet light and do not flow frequently into the river. However, in periods of heavy rain, emergency outfalls pour into the river, releasing some sewage. Fishery In its industrial heyday, the Ogmore had no salmonid fish along much of its length, although brown trout survived in many of the smaller tributaries. From the 1980s onwards, salmon and sea-trout started returning to the main river and the River Garw in ever-increasing numbers, but continued to avoid the chronically polluted Llynfi. However, even on the Llynfi, native brown trout numbers increased upstream of Tondu, and these were occasionally supplemented by stocked rainbow trout. In all parts of the river, trout can now be found, with salmon and sea trout almost everywhere. In addition eels remain common, and Millers Thumb, Gudgeon, Stone loach and Minnow are found throughout.

Usage The purpose of generating artificial noise, whether intentional or not, may vary, depending on what is considered noise in a particular context. It can be used to experiment on a subject by controlling the frequency or amplitude of the artificial noise to ascertain how the subject interacts with external stimulation. For example, to test the sensitivity of a microphone noise-reducing filter, the test administrator could generate artificial noise in a laboratory setting to determine whether the microphone suppresses the noise (i.e. filters it out), or interprets the noise as something that is not noise (i.e. passes it through). In the context of urban dwellings or establishments, artificial noise might be called light pollution, or commuter traffic. In sport In the context of spectator sports, artificial noise is the use of artificial sound-making devices to show the audience's support. In organized sports' early years, noise, such as there was, came solely from the cheering of a team's supporters. Early in the history of American football, however, the practice of employing cheerleaders became standard, and these individuals soon began to use megaphones to lead the cheering. Even prior to the era of electronics, the use of horns and cowbells had begun in an attempt to make noise louder than that which could be created through the mere use of the human voice. The invention of the compressed air horn gave fans another weapon in their arsenal. As fan sophistication increased, they learned to make noise in a way which distracted the visiting team to the assistance of their own. College football teams, especially, which had their own marching bands, came to depend upon the band to play loudly at strategic times, which, while hardly sportsmanlike, could be very effective. Two developments more than any others led sports leagues to regulate artificial noise. The first was advances in electronics which put items like portable bullhorns within reach of the typical fan. These devices could create an incredible level of noise which could make game play almost intolerable. The second was the rise of fan interest in college basketball, which is of course played in indoor venues in which the sound typically dissipates far less than in outdoor ones. Leagues did not desire to end the vocal support of fans, but learned that they would have to regulate artificial noise made by electronics, horns, bells, and the like, to make game play tolerable. Most leagues eventually banned these devices altogether, banned cheerleaders from access to public-address systems, and prevented bands from playing while the ball was actually in play. Most leagues have also followed the lead of the National Football League and also banned the playing of recorded music while actual game play is occurring, limiting it to when the ball is dead. In 2007, the Indianapolis Colts were accused of adding artificial noise against the New England Patriots In football, the referee can call a \\"delay of game\\" penalty on the home team if, after being warned, the management of the venue does not or cannot do enough to prevent the use of artificial noisemakers. In basketball, a technical foul can be called on the home team if it is felt that they are not making a sufficient effort to prevent the generation of artificial noise. In the 2004 Arena Football League playoffs, the San Jose SaberCats organization was actually fined $10,000 for distributing cowbells prior to a game versus the Tampa Bay Storm. The most common devices used to create artificial noise today are \\"thunder sticks\\", long aluminized PET film balloons which make a sort of drumming noise when banged together. It seems likely that these will be banned at some point in the near future. Some groups of fans routinely defy bans on artificial noisemakers. The most notorious noise scofflaws in North American sports are football fans of Mississippi State University. The Southeastern Conference (SEC), has completely banned artificial noisemakers for many years; however, this has not stopped MSU fans from smuggling in cowbells (long a tradition at MSU) by the thousands and ringing them during games. However, they now generally restrict their ringing to times when the ball is dead.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed March 9, 2011 It drains about east of the Cascade Range. Together with its principal tributary, the Sprague River, it provides over half the inflow to Upper Klamath Lake, the largest freshwater lake in Oregon. The lake's outlet is the Link River, which flows into Lake Ewauna and the Klamath River.  Course  The Williamson rises from a large spring in central Klamath County, on the north side of Fuego Mountain, in the Winema National Forest, about northeast of Klamath Falls (nicknamed \\"Root Beer Falls because the water is laden with nutrients carried from the Klamath Marsh a few miles upstream\\" and \\"Foam that builds up at the base of the falls gives the appearance of a root beer float\\". ). It flows in a large arc north through the mountains, then west, then southwest through Klamath Marsh and the Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge. Downstream of the refuge, the river flows roughly parallel to U.S. Route 97, receiving Spring Creek from the right at Collier Memorial State Park, about north of Chiloquin. At Chiloquin, it receives the Sprague River from the left at about river mile (RM) 11 (river kilometer (RK) 18). The Williamson enters the northern end of Upper Klamath Lake near Modoc Point, about northwest of Klamath Falls.  Watershed  At lower elevations along big streams, the Williamson watershed supports irrigated pastures and other farmlands. Livestock grazing occurs in many locations in the basin. Forests, often cut for timber, cover about 81 percent of the basin and farms account for 6 percent, while range, wetlands, water, and urban areas cover a combined 13 percent. Precipitation in the basin, which lies in the rain shadow of the Cascade Range, averages a year along the Williamson above its confluence with the Sprague and about along the Sprague.  Recreation  The Williamson is known for especially large wild Great Basin redband trout, which move into the river to spawn and to escape Upper Klamath Lake when it gets warm. Three-year-old fish \\"commonly reach or better.\\" Smaller numbers of brown trout also thrive in the Williamson, especially below Spring Creek. Lost River suckers also populate the river but are protected and cannot be caught and kept legally. Smaller rainbow trout and brook trout live in the river above Klamath Marsh. Much of the land along the river is privately owned, and public access is limited.  History  Since 2003, The Nature Conservancy and other organizations have been working to restore about of wetlands in the Williamson River delta at the north end of Upper Klamath Lake. Formerly diked and drained for farming, the delta provides habitat for millions of migrating birds as well as many native species of fish, mollusks, and aquatic plants. In early Pleistocene times, the Klamath Marsh and Upper Klamath lake were much larger; and were maintained as shallow lakes and marshes by the continued subsidence of the basin in the face of abundant sedimentation and uplift along the eastern fault scarp. The eruption of Mt. Mazama about 7,700 years ago contributed an enormous amount of sediment to the lake and marsh basins, and filled the canyon of the Williamson River.

William Lawes (April 160224 September 1645) was an English composer and musician. Life and career Lawes was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire and was baptised on 1 May 1602. He was the son of Thomas Lawes, a vicar choral at Salisbury Cathedral, and brother to Henry Lawes, a very successful composer in his own right. His patron, Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, apprenticed him to the composer John Coprario, which probably brought Lawes into contact with Charles, Prince of Wales at an early age. Both William and his elder brother Henry received court appointments after Charles succeeded to the British throne as Charles I. William was appointed as \\"musician in ordinary for lutes and voices\\" in 1635 but had been writing music for the court prior to this. Lawes spent all his adult life in Charles's employ. He composed secular music and songs for court masques (and doubtless played in them), as well as sacred anthems and motets for Charles's private worship. He is most remembered today for his sublime viol consort suites for between three and six players and his lyra viol music. His use of counterpoint and fugue and his tendency to juxtapose bizarre, spine-tingling themes next to pastoral ones in these works made them disfavoured in the centuries after his death; they have only become widely available in recent years. When Charles's dispute with Parliament led to the outbreak of the Civil War, Lawes joined the Royalist army. During the Siege of York, Lawes was living in the city and wrote at least one piece of music as a direct result of the military situation ‚Äì the round See how Cawood's dragon looks, a vivid and defiant response to the Parliamentarian capture of Cawood Castle, about ten miles from York.Gameson, Paul (2017).

Despite this, he was \\"casually shot\\" by a Parliamentarian in the rout of the Royalists at Rowton Heath, near Chester, on 24 September 1645. Although the King was in mourning for his kinsman Bernard Stuart (killed in the same defeat), he instituted a special mourning for Lawes, apparently honouring him with the title of \\"Father of Musick.\\" The author of his epitaph, Thomas Jordan, closed it with a lachrymose pun on the fact that Lawes had died at the hands of those who denied the divine right of kings: Lawes' body was lost or destroyed and his burial site is unknown.

Biography Claude Hopkins was born in Alexandria, Virginia, United States, in 1903. Historians differ in respect of the actual date of his birth. His parents were on the faculty of Howard University. A talented stride piano player and arranger, he left home at the age of 21 to become a sideman with the Wilbur Sweatman Orchestra but stayed less than a year. In 1925, he left for Europe as the musical director of The Revue Negre which starred Josephine Baker with Sidney Bechet in the band. He returned to the US in 1927 where, based in Washington, he toured the TOBA circuit with The Ginger Snaps Revue before heading once again for New York City where he took over the band of Charlie Skeets. At this time (1932‚Äì36), he led a fairly successful Harlem band employing many jazz musicians who were to become famous in their own right, such as Edmond Hall, Jabbo Smith and Vic Dickenson (although his records were arranged to feature his piano more than his band). This was his most successful period, with long residencies at the Savoy and Roseland ballrooms and at the Cotton Club. In 1937 he took his band on the road with a great deal of success. The high-pitched vocals of Orlando Roberson (Orlando Herbert Roberson 1909‚Äì1977) brought the band a good part of its popularity. The band included Ovie Alston, Fernando Arbello, Shirley Clay, Vic Dickenson, Edmond Hall, Arville Harris, Pete Jacobs, Sylvester Lewis, Ben Smith, and Jabbo Smith. He broke up the band in 1940 and used his arranging talents working for several non-jazz band leaders and for CBS. In 1948/9 he led a \\"novelty\\" band briefly but took a jazz band into The Cafe Society in 1950. From 1951 until his death, he remained in New York City, working mostly as a sideman with other Dixieland bands at festivals, New York clubs, and recording. He died on February 19, 1984.

Plot  The central story is set centuries in the future, where after horrific nuclear wars humanity united to create a peaceful global society. Due to the establishment of a utopian society, humanity has been invited to join an alien organization known as the Symbiotry of Peaceful Beings. In the twenty-fourth century, time travel is realized by the Journeyman Project, the secret program to construct Pegasus, the world's first time machine. After a brief test period proves time travel is possible, the Journeyman Project is deactivated and the Pegasus device is put under the secret watch of the Temporal Security Agency or TSA for short (also the acronym of its base of operations, the Temporal Security Annex). The TSA exists to prevent temporal rips in the space/time continuum, by which changes in the past can alter the present. The player controls a character named Gage Blackwood, Agent 5 of the Temporal Security Agency. The games revolve around Agent 5's exploits throughout time to save Earth in the present. Release history Dr. Sinclair's robots at the Morimoto Mars Colony in The Journeyman Project = The Journeyman Project = In 1993, The Journeyman Project was one of the first PC games to use high quality rendered graphics. However, it suffered from performance problems and slow animations due to its early reliance on Macromedia Director. These problems were mostly overcome with the version 2.0 release that was retitled The Journeyman Project Turbo! and published by Sanctuary Woods in 1994. The story begins with an alien ambassador arriving to finalize Earth's admission into the Symbiotry of Peaceful Beings. However, when Agent 5 is on duty a temporal rip is detected, and Earth's history is changed. The result of the new timestream is that humanity is passed over for admission into the alien organization. = The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime = This complete remake of the original Journeyman Project was published by Bandai in 1997 with some of the actors from The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time. Originally announced as a \\"Director's Cut\\", Pegasus Prime featured enhanced graphics, sounds, movies, and puzzles. It was released solely for the Power Macintosh by Bandai Digital Entertainment in North America, although it was also developed for the Apple Pippin and PlayStation in Japan. 3DO and Sega Saturn versions were also mentioned in the original product announcement, but are presumed to have been canceled. In December 2013, the game was released on DVD-ROM for Mac OS X. Windows and Linux versions were made available in March 2014. On April 10, 2014, the game was released for digital download on GOG.com. On February 19, 2015, the game was Greenlit on Steam and released for digital download on February 20, 2017. = The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time = Published in 1995 by Sanctuary Woods, Buried in Time was a complete shift in direction for the series, moving away from futuristic environments and instead preferring to go to real-life historical locations. The game also featured a completely redesigned interface and contained many more live-action scenes than the first game. = The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time = Published in 1998 by Red Orb Entertainment, the final installment uses a unique 360 degree interaction system without resorting to 3D effects. It featured impressive production values with the actors and costumes. One of the first games to be developed for the DVD-ROM medium, the enhanced DVD edition featured twice the resolution of the CD-ROM version. In 1999, Red Orb Entertainment collected the Windows versions of The Journeyman Project Turbo!, Buried in Time, and Legacy of Time into an 8-disc trilogy box set. = The Journeyman Project 4: Resurrection= According to IGN in late 1998, \\"Mindscape confirmed that the rights of The Journeyman Project #4 have been returned to the series' developer, Presto Studios\\", as a result of financial problems at Red Orb Entertainment.https://web.archive.org/web/20000424101013/http://pc.ign.com/news/5085.html With the closure of Presto Studios in November 2002, there are no plans for more Journeyman Project games to be produced. However, a fourth game design document has been mostly written.http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/features/487/ Interview The game was originally projected for an October 2000 release and the story \\"illustrated one of the potentially dangerous outcomes of time travel technology\\", but the project was eventually put on hold to concentrate on Myst III: Exile.  Characters = Main characters = *Gage Blackwood - Blackwood is Agent 5 of the Temporal Security Annex (later Temporal Security Agency) who is charged with using time machines only to guard history from people who would use time machines to damage history. On June 22, 2311 he graduated from the University of Melbourne with a master's degree in world history with honors. On June 25, 2313 he graduated at the top of his class from the Special Forces Training Academy. Five days later he became the director of Tactical Teams for the Crime Intervention Commission. On March 12 of 2315 he transferred to the Temporal Security Annex of the CIC. Gage received the Paragon Medal for his performance in the line of duty on November 8, 2318, and on December 17 of that same year he was promoted to the rank of Captain of the Temporal Protectorate. He was later chosen to form and head the Deep Time Unit on July 1, 2325. In the first Journeyman Project game, the character was only addressed as \\"Agent 5\\" and was not represented by an actor. Todd McCormick played Gage in the remake of the first game, The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime, and in The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time. In The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time, Blackwood was played by Jerry Rector. *Michelle Visard - She is Agent 3 of the Temporal Security Agency, charged with protecting time from time travelers who want to change the events of history. She is also a member of the Deep Time Unit, a branch of the Temporal Security Agency which documents history. On February 11, 2310 she earned a black belt in Karate. Three years later on April 4 she earned another in Aikido. January 19 of that same year she won first place in the NIT intercollegiate gravball competition. On March 1, 2315 she was hired by the Temporal Protectorate, and on June 9, Visard graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University with a Ph.D. in pre-unification theory and a B.A. in social psychology. Ten years later on July 15 she transferred to the Deep Time Unit. In her free time, she enjoyed Symbiotry cultural exchanges, and existentialist literature. Actress Michele Scarabelli portrayed Visard in The Journeyman Project 2, The Journeyman Project 3, and Pegasus Prime, the 1997 remake of the first game. * Dr. William Daughton - TSA Chief Engineer, played by Victor Navone in The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time and David Fenner in The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time * Jack Baldwin - TSA Commissioner, played by Daniel Mann *Arthur - Arthur is an Artificial Intelligence created by Dr. Kenneth Farnstein on a derelict asteroid miner parked in the outer reaches of the solar system. Arthur was first introduced in Journeyman Project 2: Buried In Time. From the beginning, he was combination comic relief and interactive strategy or hint guide. In Buried in Time, he was present for a great deal of the game, and he returned in The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time for essentially the entire game. Players would click upon icons in his interface, which would present themselves at certain times. One icon would dispense a quip or general observation, and another would dispense a hint, and often as not a quip as well. His skills and knowledge include his talent an accomplished artist, knowledge about 20th century pop culture, and mastery of computers. For both The Journeyman Project 2 and The Journeyman Project 3, Arthur's voice was supplied by Matt Weinhold who also wrote additional dialog for his character. *Dr. Elliot Sinclair - Dr. Sinclair is popularly known in the world of The Journeyman Project as \\"the father of time travel\\" because he invented the first time machine, a large device known as Pegasus. His pioneering work became the basis of, and raison d'√™tre for, the Temporal Security Annex, which became the Temporal Security Agency. Dr. William Daughton later improved upon his initial work to create the JumpSuit time machines for the Temporal Security Agency. During most of the first part of the first game, The Journeyman Project, the player knows of Dr. Elliot Sinclair, if at all, only as the person who invented time travel. Only once the player is able to defeat one of the robots damaging history do they learn that Dr. Sinclair is the antagonist of the game. Dr. Elliot Sinclair spends the second game, The Journeyman Project 2, incarcerated in Vega Thalon, a prison colony on one of Saturn's moons. He, his robotic henchmen, and the Pegasus device are occasionally referred to but are not relevant to the story. He returns to the storyline for The Journeyman Project 3, where Blackwood learns that Sinclair was born in Atlantis, which was destroyed by the Symbiotry in 1262 B.C, explaining Sinclair's mistrust of them in the present. Although immortal thanks to an alien artifact hidden in Atlantis, Sinclair dies five days before the game begins, as his immortality slowly failed after leaving Earth. In all three games (although his entire appearance in the second game was portions of what he'd done in the first game) Dr. Elliot Sinclair was portrayed by Graham Jarvis. = Other characters = * Gail Yakamura - Agent 1, Security * Neil Geddy - Agent 2, Security * Allan Carver - Agent 4, Security * Roger O'Rourke - Agent 6, Research * Silene Flores - Agent 7, Security * Marcus Warner - Agent 8, Security * Vladich Yasignova - Agent 9, Security * Tamara Walsh - Agent 10, Research * Jhessela - Cyrollan Ambassador to Earth  Sources  The Journeyman Project 2 & 3 strategy guides.

He served as mayor from 1988 until he left office in 2004http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-01-03/news/0401030065_1_first- black-mayor-john-norquist-pratt to lead the Congress for the New Urbanism. Personal background Norquist was born in Princeton, New Jersey, where his father, Rev. Ernest O. Norquist was attending seminary. His mother is Jeannette Norquist. He is married to Susan Mudd and has one son, Benjamin, and one daughter, Katherine. Susan is the descendant of Samuel Mudd, the doctor who treated President Abraham Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth. Early political career He was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1975, where he served until seeking and winning a seat in the Wisconsin State Senate in 1983. In 1974 he ran against completing the Stadium South Freeway, which was to run from Milwaukee County Stadium south to I-894. In 1974, nearly 50% of the freeway segment was either built or the land was cleared for construction. Norquist opposed the Stadium South despite his constituents voting for completion in the November 1974 Milwaukee County freeway referenda. All five remaining Milwaukee County freeway segments passed in the November 1974 referendum (complementing the April 1967 city vote in favor of the Park East-Lake Freeway project). Norquist joined forces with emerging generation of legislators including James Moody (later a US representative) in opposing freeway expansion and was re-elected to the Assembly and advanced to the State Senate. While in the Senate, Norquist served on the powerful Joint Finance Committee and was recognized by Milwaukee Magazine as a leading legislator. Mayor of Milwaukee In 1988, Norquist campaigned and won the job of mayor of Milwaukee. His tenure as mayor of Milwaukee came on the heels of the 28-year reign by Henry Maier. Norquist can perhaps best be described as a \\"fiscally conservative socialist.\\"http://governing.com/poy/1998/ptnorq.htm He was strongly in favor of light rail as a solution for the city's transit problems and was known throughout the country for his anti-freeway stance and for the removal of the Park East Freeway, the largest highway ever purposely destroyed. He consistently reduced the property tax rate every year since becoming mayor and kept city budgets from growing beyond the rate of inflation. One of the first controversies of Norquist's tenure occurred in 1988, when he took a trip to Israel. The trip was paid for by local Milwaukee Jewish organizations, but as a result of the controversy, Norquist afterward paid much of the cost himself. On his return, the Milwaukee Sentinel printed a political cartoon showing him getting off a plane dressed as a Hasidic Jewish rabbi. The cartoon created an uproar, and the Sentinel published an apology for it. In December 2000, Norquist's future as mayor was thrown into doubt as a staff assistant, Marilyn Figueroa, alleged that the mayor had sexually harassed her. Norquist admitted to a five-year consensual affair, but whether it was consensual is contested. Eventually, in April 2002, Norquist announced that he would not seek a fifth term as mayor in 2004. In July, 2001, when the Communist Party held its 27th national convention in the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee student union, Norquist sent the convention his greetings, noting commonalities between the city's socialist heritage and the goals of the Communist Party. Norquist later released a statement saying he \\"does not endorse Communist ideology and condemns many elements of Communist history.\\" When presented in June 2003 with the opportunity to lead the Congress for the New Urbanism, Norquist said that he would resign at the beginning of the following year rather than serve out his full term. The announcement was timed to prevent a special election. Instead, the head of the common council, Marvin Pratt, served as acting mayor. His term was marked by public conflicts with other city leaders, including Bo Black, former head of Summerfest; Arthur Jones, his one-time bodyguard who became chief of police; and Bradley DeBraska, head of the police union. Despite some conflict, Norquist's legacy in Milwaukee includes a decline in poverty, a boom in downtown housing, and reforms in both education and welfare. Post mayoral career At the beginning of 2004, Norquist began working full-time as the head of the Congress for the New Urbanism, an urban planning and development reform organization based in Chicago, Illinois. He left CNU in 2014 after a decade with the organization. During his tenure, he spoke often and eloquently about the regulatory obstacles that continue to get in the way of good urbanism. Building on his experience taking down the Park East Freeway in Milwaukee, he championed a national CNU campaign that has helped advocates and local officials in their own highway teardown movements. Norquist is now the John M DeGrove Fellow at Florida Atlantic University and Adjunct Professor at DePaul University Real Estate Program. Works Norquist, John O. The Wealth of Cities (1998).

He is best known as the composer of the Norwegian national anthem, \\"Ja, vi elsker dette landet\\".Rikard Nordraak Store norske leksikon Biography Rikard Nordraak was born and grew up in Oslo, Norway. His family came from the Nordr√•k farm in the district Land in the county of Oppland. His father was a brother of Inger Elise Nordraach, the mother of the Norwegian writer and poet, Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson. Nordraak's musical gifts became evident at an early age, but as for many other artists at that time, a different career was already planned. He was going to pursue a career within business, and when he was fifteen he was sent to business school in Copenhagen. Nonetheless his musical interests prevailed and instead of studying business he ended up studying music, and in 1859 he went to Berlin for advanced studies. After six months he had to return home and he continued studies in Oslo, and his first compositions came during the winter of 1859‚Äì60. In 1861 he went back to Berlin to continue his studies, and he stayed there for two more years. The compositions that he himself marked opus 1 were published in 1863, and contained six songs with texts by his cousin Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson, amongst others. At this time Nordraak also composed Ja, vi elsker, which became the Norwegian national anthem. It was first performed publicly on 17 May 1864 in connection with the 50th anniversary of the Norwegian Constitution. The lyrics were written by Bj√∏rnson between 1859 and 1868.Rikard Nordraak ‚Äì Biography Music Information Centre Norway In 1864, he met Edvard Grieg in Copenhagen and inspired him with the idea of devoting his genius to Norwegian melody and the cultivation of a specifically national art. Nordraak later wrote incidental music for Bj√∏rnson's plays Maria Stuart i Skotland and Sigurd Slembe. He published his Fem norske Digte: Op. 2, consisting of songs and poems by Bj√∏rnson and Jonas Lie. This was the last of his compositions that would be published during his lifetime. Rikard Nordraak's first grave in Berlin In May 1865 he returned to Berlin to continue his education, but he was stricken with tuberculosis in October and died in Paris the following March, only 23 years old. He was buried in Kirchhof Jerusalem in the Berlin neighborhood of Kreuzberg (Friedhof IV der Gemeinde Jerusalem ‚Äì und Neue Kirche). In 1925, Nordraak's coffin was brought home to Norway and buried in the Honor Grove at V√•r Frelsers gravlund in Oslo.√Üreslunden 27 Rikard Nordraak V√•r Frelsers gravlund Nordraak did not live long enough to produce much music. About forty compositions, mostly smaller works like songs, pieces for male choir and a few piano compositions, have been preserved. The biggest of these compositions, is the Scherzo Capriccio for piano solo, given the opus number 3, published posthumously by Edvard Grieg. This is a kind of rondo, using several features from Norwegian folk music; rhythms typical in sl√•tter, and dissonances typical for the hardingfele. However, the thematic material does not have this connection with folk music. Rikard Nordraak. Samlede verker, a critical edition of Nordraak overall compositions were published by √òyvind Anker and Olav Gurvin (1942). Finn Benestad Rikard Nordraak. Norsk biografisk leksikon With his passionate patriotism and great love for folk music, Nordraak's main contribution to Norwegian music history was to be an inspiration for contemporary composers, such as Grieg. When Grieg heard of Nordraak's death, he composed the Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak (S√∏rgemarsj over Rikard Nordraak).

The Iraqi Interim Government itself took the place of the Coalition Provisional Authority (and the Iraq Interim Governing Council) on June 28, 2004, and was replaced by the Iraqi Transitional Government on May 3, 2005. Organization Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi. It was recognized by the U.S., the United Nations, the Arab League and several other countries as being the sovereign government of Iraq (see Iraqi sovereignty for more information). The U.S. retained significant de facto power in the country and critics contend that the government existed only at the pleasure of the United States and other coalition countries, whose military forces still remain in Iraq. The coalition did promise that its troops would leave if the new sovereign government requested it, but no such request was made. =The law and the head of government= The government's head of government was Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and his deputy was the influential and charismatic Barham Salih. The ceremonial head of state was President Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer. They were all sworn in at a second and more public ceremony on June 28, 2004, shortly after the small private one at which L. Paul Bremer, the Coalition Provisional Authority's administrator, formally gave chief justice Midhat Mahmoud the legal documents instituting the hand-over. Absent a permanent constitution, the new government operated under the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period. Allawi was a former member of the Iraq Interim Governing Council and was chosen by the council to be the Interim Prime Minister of Iraq to govern the country beginning with the United States' handover of sovereignty (June 28, 2004) until national elections, scheduled for early 2005. Although many believe the decision was reached largely on the advice of United Nations special envoy to Iraq, Lakhdar Brahimi, the New York Times reported that Brahimi only endorsed him reluctantly after pressure from U.S. officials, including Paul Bremer, the former US Iraqi Administrator. Two weeks later, Brahimi announced his resignation, due to \\"great difficulties and frustration.\\" Allawi is often described as a moderate Shia (a member of Iraq's majority faith) chosen for his secular background and ties to the United States. However, his image has been undermined with the media suggesting that Allawi was Washington's puppet. Actions of the Interim Government After his interim government assumed legal custody of Saddam Hussein and re-introduced capital punishment, Allawi gave assurances that he would not interfere with the trial and would accept any court decisions. In an interview with Dubai-based TV station al-Arabiya he said: \\"As for the execution, that is for the court to decide‚Äîso long as a decision is reached impartially and fairly.\\" =\\"Precedents\\" and accusations= In early July 2004, Allawi issued an unprecedented statement claiming that the Iraqi interim government had provided intelligence for the U.S. air strikers with 500 and 1000 pound (220 and 450 kg) bombs on Fallujah in July. Later he announced new security measures, including the right to impose martial law and curfews, as well as a new counter-terrorist intelligence unit, the General Security Directorate. Allawi vowed to crush the Iraqi insurgency, saying he would \\"annihilate those terrorist groups\\". On July 17, The Sydney Morning Herald alleged that one week before the handover of sovereignty, Allawi himself summarily executed six suspected insurgents at a Baghdad police station. The allegations are backed up by two independent sources and the execution is said to have taken place in presence of about a dozen Iraqi police, four American security men and Interior Minister Falah al- Naqib. Allawi reportedly said that the execution was to \\"send a clear message to the police on how to deal with insurgents.\\" Both Allawi's office and Naqib have denied the report. US ambassador John Negroponte did not clearly deny the allegations. On July 18, Iraqi militants offered a $285,000 reward for anyone who could kill Iyad Allawi. =Allawi's policies= In August, Allawi closed the Iraqi office of Al Jazeera for thirty days. His minister Hoshiyar Zebari deplored the \\"one-sided and biased coverage\\" and declared that the interim government \\"will not allow some people to hide behind the slogan of freedom of the press and media.\\" Allawi also appointed ex-Baathist and former Saddam intelligence officer Ibrahim Janabi as the head of the Higher Media Commission, a regulator of Iraq's media. The banning of Al Jazeera was widely criticised in the Arab world and the West, for example by Reporters Sans Fronti√®res who called it \\"a serious blow to press freedom\\". The negotiations that followed the fighting between Muqtada al-Sadr's militia and joint US/Iraqi forces in Najaf ended when Allawi withdrew his emissary Mouwaffaq al- Rubaie on August 14. An al-Sadr spokesman alleged that they \\"had agreed with Rubaie on all points but Allawi called him back and he ended the issue.\\" =Criticism= Allawi has been heavily criticised by members of his own government. Justice minister Malik Dohan al-Hassan resigned over the issue of an arrest warrant of Ahmed Chalabi. Vice president Ibrahim al-Jafari commented on the attacks against al-Sadr: \\"War is the worst choice, and it is only used by a bad politician.\\" Another Iraqi official said: \\"There are brush fires burning out of control all over the place from terrorists and insurgents, and he starts a new bonfire in Najaf.\\" While the strategy of \\"eliminat[ing] Moqtada Sadr's political movement\\" by \\"crushing his military power\\" instead of integrating him into the political process received mostly praise in the West, the Arab press levelled harsh criticism of Allawi's handling of the Najaf situation.

The now extinct Piro language is in the family of Tiwa languages. Some Piros were hospitable to the first Spanish colonists who arrived in 1598. As a result, the Spanish gave first one, then another, Piro pueblo the name Socorro, which means \\"aid\\" or \\"help\\" (in case of problems or difficulties). In later years, however, the Piros like most other Pueblo groups suffered increasingly from the strains of colonial rule. Local rebellions broke out on several occasions in the 1660s and 1670s, but the Spaniards always retained the upper hand. By the time of the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the Piro communities had declined to such an extent that the famous rebellion took place without them. Several hundred Piros (and Tiwas) accompanied the fleeing Spaniards south to El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico); others scattered and joined other Pueblo groups. None of the Piro pueblos were ever resettled by the original inhabitants. Today, the Piro people are part of the Piro-Manso-Tiwa Tribe of San Juan de Guadalupe Pueblo in Las Cruces, New Mexico as well as in Tortugas Pueblo. Currently, there is a long-term archaeological project at the Piro pueblo of Tzelaqui/Sevilleta north of present-day Socorro.

It lies between Socorro and San Antonio along the Rio Grande. History In 1667, Captain Luis L√≥pez was alcalde mayor (mayor) of the Piro Pueblo of Senec√∫. It appears that he had an hacienda on the east bank of the Rio Grande. During the 18th century the estancia was mentioned in the journals of a few travellers though it had been abandoned after the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. The village of Luis Lopez appears to have been founded by the early to mid 1830s. At that time it was located on the west bank of the Rio Grande just east of its present-day site.Marshall, Michael P. and Walt, Henry J. Rio Abajo: Prehistory and History of a Rio Grande Province, (Santa Fe: New Mexico Historic Preservation Program, 1984) pp. 277-278) Luis Lopez has been listed in United States census every decade at least as recently as 1980 since 1850, except for 1870. Since the village was not counted in that year, it is thought that it may have been abandoned for a short time and then relocated to its present position above the flood plain.Marshall, Michael P. and Walt, Henry J. Rio Abajo: Prehistory and History of a Rio Grande Province, (Santa Fe: New Mexico Historic Preservation Program, 1984) pp. 277-278) However, most of Luis Lopez remains in the flood plain, protected from the Rio Grande by levees. In May 1941, severe flooding required the evacuation of families in the floodplain.Staff (20 May 1941) \\"Rio Hits Again at Santone Bridge; Threatens Levee\\" Las Cruces Sun-News page 1, column 7 Luis Lopez was also listed in both the 1833 and 1845 New Mexico census, details of which can be found at Albuquerque Public Library, Main Library, 2nd floor Genealogy Center. In 1952 the Luis Lopez School District was consolidated with the Socorro School District and the school was closed.Staff (20 August 1952) \\"County Aid Powers of State School Board Challenged\\" Albuquerque Journal page 11, column 4 However, the building continued to be used as a community center for some years. Today, the community of Luis Lopez consists of farms and a small suburb. New wells have brought growth to the community. The community is a suburb of Socorro, New Mexico.
