He was a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.  Biography  He was born in Belgrade on 12 April 1852. After completing high school (gymnasium), he received a state scholarship, and in 1866 he also studied iconography with an itinerant Italian artist, then living in Belgrade. He pursued his studies in art in Panƒçevo. In 1873 he went to Vienna to study sculpture. Owing to poor health, he returned to Belgrade. Upon receiving a new state scholarship he resumed his studies at the prestigious Kunstgewerbeschule in Munich in 1874. According to some, he is considered the originator of Serbian sculpture. He has made numerous public monuments, among his best known works are busts of Vuk Karad≈æiƒá, Prince Milo≈° and ƒêura Daniƒçiƒá. Petar Ubavkiƒá died in Belgrade on Vidovdan, 28 June 1910 and was buried in the New Cemetery. Legacy Today Ubavkiƒá is considered the premier Serbian sculptor in an age when art flourished to its maximum. He was indeed the creator of many public monuments at the time of the rule of Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá. Among his most important artistic works realized according to the cannons of realism or even verism, are the many Belgrade monuments, executed by Ubavkiƒá, including some in other regions of Serbia, particularly the monument to King Milan Obrenoviƒá in the Church of St. Paraskeve in ƒÜurlina.

Attraction At the heart of Toy Story Playland is the land's oldest character toy: an authentic \\"Collector's Edition\\" Slinky Dog, complete with original 1950s cardboard box. This powered roller coaster is the tamest attraction in the land, simply offering a continuous, circular ride up and down a relatively gentle incline. Aimed primarily at a younger age group, it nevertheless provides enough fun and kitsch design to be appreciated by a wide demographic of visitors. Entering a queue line formed out of Lincoln Logs building blocks, visitors eventually step inside the giant box itself, which has a retro-styled boardgame printed on its inside. The giant Slinky Dog train is connected end-to-end, travelling in a loop around a dog bowl filled with rubber bones and Andy's baseball. It builds up enough speed to provide a mild thrill which, combined with the quick rise and descent, provides a ride not dissimilar to Dumbo the Flying Elephant. The layout takes advantage of the land's sloping elevation to create the illusion of being shrunk, especially when visitors stand at the foot of the ride, its enormous box towering above, surrounded by oversized grass.

The reserve is diverse and includes 200-year- old woodland, 340 ponds, and areas of grassland. Volunteers help Froglife with the active management of the reserve which includes building hibernacula for newts (shelters in which they can safely hibernate), tree felling to allow light onto the woodland floor, and constructing piles of rotting vegetation for grass snakes to lay their eggs in. Adjacent to the reserve is Haddon Lake, one of many former brick pits in the Hampton area. This site provides an additional ideal habitat for newts, and a tranquil haven for other wildlife. History The site was previously a working brick pit, with extraction continuing as late as the 1990s. The extraction of bricks and dumping of unwanted material is responsible for the undulating 'lunar' landscape visible on part of the reserve. Once the pit had ceased to operate, nature took over and now a large variety of wildlife has made its home at the reserve. Wildlife Europe's largest population of great crested newts can be found at the Hampton Nature Reserve. In addition to this the site is also important for stoneworts (rare algae), water voles, and is home to the only known colony of the grizzled skipper butterfly in Peterborough. Many species of tree, wildflowers such as the bee orchid, and a wide range of fauna such as green woodpeckers, bats, kestrels, grass snakes, dragonflies and damselflies can all be found at the Hampton Nature Reserve.

The radar site was located at the summit of Cottonwood Butte, west-northwest of Cottonwood in Idaho County, Idaho. It was closed in 1965 and transferred to the state of Idaho in 1974, when it was converted to its present use as a minimum-security correctional facility.Idaho Department of Corrections - North Idaho Correctional Institution - accessed 2011-11-27 Cottonwood Peak Air Force Station was initially part of Phase II of the Air Defense Command Mobile Radar program. The Air Force approved this expansion of the Mobile Radar program on October 23, 1952. Radars in this network were designated \\"SM.\\" History The station became operational on 1 July 1958 when the 822d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sq) was assigned to the new station. The station consisted of 66 buildings, including operation and administrative facilities, 3 dormitories, 27 family housing units, 3 radar domes, and the normal support facilities/utilities. The site was divided into three general areas: the operations area at the summit, cantonment area at mid-mountain, and a family housing area at the north end of the city of Cottonwood. The 822d AC&W; Sq operated used AN/MPS-7, AN/MPS-14, and AN/FPS-6 radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. During 1960 Cottonwood AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-07 at Larson AFB, Washington. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 822d Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 September 1960. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In 1962 the 822d began operating an AN/FPS-24 search radar and an additional AN/FPS-6B radar, as the AN/MPS-7 and AN/MPS-14 units were retired. In 1964 the AN/FPS-6B was upgraded to an AN/FPS-90 and Cottonwood AFS was shifted to feeding data to the SAGE Data center DC-12 at McChord AFB. In addition to the main facility, Cottonwood operated an AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler site: * Waha, ID (SM-150A) The closure of the base was announced in November 1964. A catastrophic bearing failure in the AN/FPS-24 antenna pedestal led to an early shutdown of the station and the inactivation of the 822d Radar Squadron on 25 June 1965 (only two or three years after the AN/FPS-24 radome was installed over the antenna) as part of fiscal year 1965 cutbacks. The Cantonment Area was used from 1965 to 1974 by the Office of Economic Opportunity as a Job Corps Center. The State of Idaho Dept. of Corrections acquired the property in 1974, and has occupied the site ever since as North Idaho Correctional Institution. This is a program-specific prison designed for male offenders sentenced to a retained jurisdiction commitment by the court. It provides a sentencing alternative for the courts to target those offenders who might, after a period of programming and evaluation, be viable candidates for probation rather than incarceration. Today most of the radar site on the mountain summit is torn down. The AN/FPS-24 tower still stands but little else, as only building foundations and deteriorated streets remain.

The tin-silver-copper alloy has been the prevailing alloy system used to replace tin-lead because it is near eutectic, with adequate thermal fatigue properties, strength, and wettability.Lead-Free Solder FAQ‚Äôs Lead-free solder is gaining much attention as the environmental effects of lead in industrial products is recognized, and as a result of Europe‚Äôs RoHS legislation to remove lead and other hazardous materials from electronics. Japanese electronics companies have also looked at Pb-free solder for its industrial advantages. Typical alloys are 3‚Äì4% silver, 0.5‚Äì0.7% copper, and the balance (95%+) tin. For example, the common \\"SAC305\\" solder is 3.0% silver and 0.5% copper. Cheaper alternatives with less silver are used in some applications, such as SAC105 and SAC0307 (0.3% silver, 0.7% copper), at the expense of a somewhat higher melting point. Applications SAC alloys are the main choice for lead-free surface-mount technology (SMT) assembly in the electronics industry.Peter Biocca, Lead-free SMT Soldering Defects: How to Prevent Them, mirror: Lead-Free Defects in Reflow Soldering ‚Äì How to Prevent Them, emsnow, Feb 17, 2005 SMT is a process where components of circuit assemblies are mounted directly onto the surface of a printed circuit board and soldered in place. SMT has largely replaced ‚Äúthrough-hole technology‚Äù where components are fitted with wire leads into holes in the circuit board. History In 2000, there were several lead-free assemblies and chip products initiatives being driven by the Japan Electronic Industries Development Association (JEIDA) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE). These initiatives resulted in tin-silver-copper alloys being considered and tested as lead-free solder ball alternatives for array product assemblies.STATS picks pure-tin solder as best lead-free packaging solution, eetimes, Nov 24, 2000 In 2003, tin-silver-copper was being used as a lead-free solder. However, its performance was criticized because it left a dull, irregular finish and it was difficult to keep the copper content under control.Can lead-free solder joints be good looking? (and give better sounds quality?), interconnectionworld, Dec 16, 2003 In 2005, tin-silver-copper alloys constituted approximately 65% of lead-free alloys used in the industry and this percentage has been increasing. Large companies such as Sony and Intel switched from using lead-containing solder to a tin-silver-copper alloy.\\"Getting the Lead Out\\" T. DeBonis, Intel 2007 Constraints and tradeoffs The process requirements for SAC solders (Pb-free) and Sn-Pb solders are different both materially and logistically for electronic assembly. In addition, the reliability of Sn-Pb solders is well established, while SAC solders are still undergoing study, (though much work has been done to justify the use of SAC solders, such as the iNEMI Lead Free Solder Project). One important difference is that Pb-free soldering requires higher temperatures and increased process control to achieve the same results as that of the tin-lead method. The melting point of SAC alloys is 217‚Äì220 ¬∞C, or about 34 ¬∞C higher than the melting point of the eutectic tin-lead (63/37) alloy. This requires peak temperatures in the range of 235‚Äì245 ¬∞C to achieve wetting and wicking. Some of the components susceptible to SAC assembly temperatures are electrolytic capacitors, connectors, opto-electronics, and older style plastic components. However, a number of companies have started offering 260 ¬∞C compatible components to meet the requirements of Pb-free solders. iNEMI has proposed that a good target for development purposes would be around 260 ¬∞C.Lead-free Solder Assembly: Impact and Opportunity, Edwin Bradley, Motorola Also, SAC solders are alloyed with a larger number of metals so there is the potential for a far wider variety of intermetallics to be present in a solder joint. These more complex compositions can result in solder joint microstructures that are not as thoroughly studied as current tin-lead solder microstructures. These concerns are magnified by the unintentional use of lead-free solders in either processes designed solely for tin-lead solders or environments where material interactions are poorly understood. For example, the reworking of a tin-lead solder joint with Pb-free solder. These mixed-finish possibilities could negatively impact the solder‚Äôs reliability. Advantages SAC solders have outperformed high-Pb solders C4 joints in ceramic ball grid array (CBGA) systems, which are ball-grid arrays with a ceramic substrate.PCB Glossary The CBGA showed consistently better results in thermal cycling for Pb-free alloys. The findings also show that SAC alloys are proportionately better in thermal fatigue as the thermal cycling range decreases. SAC performs better than Sn-Pb at the less extreme cycling conditions. Another advantage of SAC is that it appears to be more resistant to gold embrittlement than Sn-Pb. In test results, the strength of the joints is substantially higher for the SAC alloys than the Sn-Pb alloy. Also, the failure mode is changed from a partially brittle joint separation to a ductile tearing with the SAC.

One side of the Bowder Stone is said to be a simulacrum of the face of Balder and a small hole is said to have once existed on his head where in Norse mythology the weapon pierced and killed him. A carving representing the sun was supposedly located just above the hole.Hodgson,Page 5 The oldest photographs show a well defined chin and lips whilst a second face is seen by some.Hodgson, Page 5 In the 1500s German miners emigrated to Borrowdale to work the copper mines and the legends of 'Balder' may have come with them.Hodgson, Page 10 =Mr Pocklington= Although the stone was visited and admired by many, such as William Sawrey Gilpin in 1772,Gilpin, Page 194 Joseph Pocklington was the first to take practical steps to attract visitors, purchasing the site in 1798, fencing it off, clearing away all the smaller rocks and erecting 'Bowderstone Cottage' to house a guide and building a ladder to allow visitors to easily reach the top and admire the outstanding views.Hodgson, Page 7 In addition to all this activity Joseph designed a hermitage or chapel himself as a Christian counterpoint to the 'druidical' standing stone or menhir that he had also erected.Nottingham Hidden History Team Bowder Stone, 1890s During the works a natural hollow was discovered that ran underneath the boulder and Joseph had a small hole drilled through its base, thereby creating a space that made it possible for visitors to crawl into the hollow to have a ‚Äòhand shake for luck‚Äô with the guideHodgson, Page 5 or with another visitor on the other side of the Stone.Nottingham Hidden History Team At first Joseph Pocklington took his friends by coach to admire the Bowder Stone however later it was opened up to all and large numbers of travellers were escorted around the site by the guide that he employed.Nottingham Hidden History Team In 1817 Joseph died and the Bowder Stone was sold, however it continued to be open to all visitors and the women only tradition was only broken only by John Raven.

Mild bilateral shortening of the thumbs and great toes, caused primarily by shortening of the distal phalanx and/or the first metacarpal or metatarsal, is the most common limb malformation and results in impaired dexterity or apposition of the thumbs. Urogenital abnormalities include abnormalities of the ureters and urethra and various degrees of incomplete M√ºllerian fusion in females and hypospadias of variable severity with or without chordee in males. Vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent urinary tract infections, and chronic pyelonephritis are common; fertility is normal. Cause Hand-foot-genital syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The proportion of cases caused by de novo mutations is unknown because of the small number of individuals described. If a parent of the proband is affected, the risk to the siblings is 50%. When the parents are clinically unaffected, the risk to the sibs of a proband appears to be low. Each child of an individual with HFGS has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Prenatal testing may be available through laboratories offering custom prenatal testing for families in which the disease-causing mutation has been identified in an affected family member.

Photo by Corporal J. Vaughn, Delta-2 Platoon, U.S. Marine. The Phong Nh·ªã and Phong Nh·∫•t massacre (, Vietnamese: Th·∫£m s√°t Phong Nh·∫•t v√† Phong Nh·ªã) was a massacre reported to have been conducted by the 2nd Marine Brigade of the Republic of Korea Marines (ROKMC) on 12 February 1968 of unarmed citizens in the villages of Phong Nh·ªã and Phong Nh·∫•t, ƒêi·ªán B√†n District of Qu·∫£ng Nam Province in South Vietnam. The South Korean forces had been newly transferred from the area, in the wake of the Tet Offensive, with the village located in a densely populated region in and around Da Nang. Transferring Korean Marines to the populated Da Nang sector from a less populated sector was unpopular with ARVN and US Commanders and setting back pacification and relation-building efforts, due to the behaviour of Korean forces. Events At the time the massacre occurred, the Phong Nh·ªã () villagers had had a close relationship with the U.S. Marines as the villagers formed a part of the Combined Action Program (CAP) and the village men were enlisted as South Vietnamese soldiers. At about 10:00 members of the ROKMC 1st Company, 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Brigade passed the CAP Delta-2 team (). At 10:30 the ROKMC company moved west towards Phong Nh·ªã and Phong Nh·∫•t () and began taking fire from Phong Nh·∫•t. At about 11:00 an LVTP-5 supporting the ROKMC unit on Highway 1 was hit by a command-detonated mine and disabled. A U.S. Marine operating with the 1st Company believed that the mine had been triggered from Phong Nh·∫•t. The 1st Company swept through Phong Nh·ªã and Phong Nh·∫•t before returning to Phong Nhi. At 13:00 shooting was heard and smoke seen coming from Phong Nh·ªã. At about 13:30 a Popular Force soldier from CAP Delta-2 brought in two young boys who had been shot and a woman who had been stabbed. At about 14:00 the CAP Delta-2 members attempted unsuccessfuly to contact the U.S. liaison officer at ROK 2nd Marine Brigade headquarters. The 2nd Marine Brigade G-3 officer advised the CPA Delta-2 team that ROK Marines were not in the Phong Nh·ªã area. The CAP Delta-2 team requested mortar fire into the Phong Nh·ªã area but this request was denied. At about 15:00 a patrol from CAP Delta-2 moved into Phong Nh·ªã and evacuated the survivors. A total of 69 civilians were found dead in three main groups in Phong Nh·ªã and Phong Nh·∫•t. The operation by the ROKMC was approved by nor notified by the District Chief. III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF) situation reports for the 2nd Marine Brigade confirmed that the 1st Company was in the area and that they received small arms fire at 11:05 and 15:30 resulting in one Marine wounded. On 16 February 1968 the ROKMC Executive Officer left 30 bags of rice at the District headquarters. Investigation Eyewitness testimony from both the members of CAP Delta-2 and survivors at the hospital prompted grounds for a war-crime investigation for investigation were done from CAP commanders and COMUSMACV, both making direct demands that ROK commander Lieutenant general Chae Myung-shin investigate. On 16 April 1968 the III MAF reported on the incident to Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV). A total of five other hamlet massacres were investigated as well, at Hoang Chau hamlet, Phuoc My, Thanh Phu and Hoa Phon. On 29 April 1968, MACV sent the report to the General Chae. On 4 June 1968, General Chae advised MACV that he had investigated the incident and stated that ROKMC forces had never been in Phong Nh·ªã and that operations were limited to Phong Nh·∫•t. Chae suggested that the massacre had been conducted by Vietcong (VC) forces disguised in Korean-style camouflage uniforms in order to discredit the Korean forces. Chae stated that there were numerous cases in which the VC utilized the duckhunter pattern used by the ROKMC to commit misdeeds in order to incite unpopular opinion supporting his claim with the testimony of the District Chief and an ARVN Sergeant in CAP Delta-2. Chae advised that the bags of rice were not offered as an apology but were part of normal refuges assistance. VC secret reports discuss this massacre, clearly blaming the Korean forces for conducting this massacre and discussed reprisals to rally villagers to their cause and away from GVN/USMC pacification efforts.  Aftermath  Abandoned children bodies in ditch. U.S Army and South Vietnamese Army were searching for other abandoned bodies. The massacre negatively impacted ongoing pacification efforts in the region and became widely known. Transferring the ROKMC to the populated Da Nang sector of I Corps from an unpopulated sector set back considerable effort in winning support and deteriorated relations with locals. This massacre alongside the H√† My massacre undermined ongoing efforts at pacification. South Vietnamese and US commanders from the region had a negative appraisal of Koreans with General Rathvon M. Tompkins and General Robert E. Cushman Jr. being quite negative about the Koreans being transferred to the sector, as they were regarded as generally uncooperative and unwilling to engage in security while committing atrocities. These atrocities were reported by ARVN/US commanders and sent down to Saigon. Korean forces were transferred back to II Corps/II Field Force following this incident, and were relegated to guarding bases and minimising any offensive or combat actions. In 1969, one of the victims' families made a petition to the President of South Vietnam's Parliament for compensation. The local South Vietnamese civilians were particularly disturbed that the massacre was perpetrated by ROK forces against villagers who had family members in ARVN forces. Testimonies of survivors at Da Nang hospital, as well as the USMC patrol that had found the victims had identified ROK-forces as responsible with no Vi·ªát C·ªông in the vicinity. On 11 November 2000, General Chae conceded that Chief of Staff of the United States Army General William Westmoreland demanded the investigation several times. Chae still claimed that the two villages were not in the route of the ROKMC and repeatedly maintained blame on the VC who allegedly wore the South Korean marine uniforms. The event was prominently featured in the Korean media when it was discovered by Ku Su-Jeong looking at Hanoi's archives around the time of relationship normalisation, and Korean civic groups have called on apologies for this event from Korean leaders alongside survivors of the massacre. South Korean sculptors Kim Seo- kyung & Kim Eun-sung, two sculptors who designed the comfort women Pieta statues, have built a similar commemorative statue at the location of the massacre.

It incorporated many functional elements from an arsenal of army- style hand-to-hand combat and martial arts styles from around the world, and has been intened for use in combat environment. It is relatively modern and quickly developing style of martial arts, and as a combat sport it received popularity for full-contact sparrings while offering a relatively modest risk of injury to sportspeople.the Site of Army Hand-to-Hand Combat Contrary to Combat Sambo contests, which are being held at a standard wrestling mat, ARB contests require a 10√ó10 m (33√ó33 ft) tatami-like squared area.  History  ARB's origin as a military-applied martial art dates back to 1979 when the city of Kaunas (the settlement Gai≈æi≈´nai, military unit n.o. 42235) held the first championship for Airborne troops on the sports base of the 7th division of guards of Airborne troops. Since then, the Airborne troops' ARB championships have been held annually. ARB was created by experts and enthusiasts of physical preparation and was played as a sport of the Soviet Army. It was also successfully introduced into the Soviet army to train soldiers.an Information from official site Federation of ARB of Russia Carrying out of the first championship on ARB would not have been possible without long-term practice and experiments with various kinds of single combat. Black belt-rated sportsmen and prize-winners of competitions in boxing, wrestling, judo and other fighting sports were carefully selected to participate in a game of ARB. Methodical work of fighters and commanders, has also impulsed to the origin of the martial art which is nowadays widely known under the name \\"Army Hand-to-Hand Combat\\". At that point in time (the beginning of the 1970s) actual training of regular soldiers for hand-to-hand combat was named \\"as the Program of preparation of instructors in sports and special receptions of a landing\\".The certificate from October, 26, 1976, given out to Sergeant Duduevu S. K. that it has studied a complete course of instructors in sports and special receptions of a landing and has received corresponding qualification  Rules  A distinctive part of ARB that sets it apart from other full contact single combat martial arts is the possibility of finishing with the opponent on hands and feet from a standing position. The opponent may call \\"Stop\\", as some kicks on the head of the opponent may not be protected by a helmet, and can lead to heavy damages that interrupt the match immediately. Blows of the opponent by a foot in a head is a knock-down to the fighter who has performed such a blow. the Videoclip with cuttings of beautiful fights by rules of Army Hand-to-Hand Combat Sunday, June 14, 2020 = General rules = * Fights are played on a square carpet that is no smaller than 14√ó14 meters. Fights occur on the square with the border of the fight zone at 8√ó8 m or 10√ó10 m. The \\"external zone\\" of the carpet serves for the safety of sportsmen and is no less than 3 meters in size. On a knockout of a fighter the carpet fight stops and a command \\"Stop\\" is issued. The judge will then issue a \\"Fighters to the middle\\" command, which directs sportsmen to go to the center (middle) of the carpet. Thus, if a knockout of one or more fighters has happened on the carpet (including on the safety zone), and the combat's termination has occurred outside of the fighting square, such reception is estimated, and the combat stops by the general rules. * Fighters break on age (concerning fighters till 18 years and division into age categories depends on Position about competitions) and weight categories beginning from weight to 60 kg and to weight over 90 kg with step of 5 kg.

It is located south of Kalispell, Montana near the community of Lakeside. It was closed in 1978 by the Air Force, and the radar site on Blacktail Mountain was turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Today the radar site is part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS), designated by NORAD as Western Air Defense Sector (WADS) Ground Equipment Facility J-78. The former garrison site at 501 Blacktail Road in Lakeside was acquired by Youth With A Mission in 1985, with the remaining eight houses previously retained by the Air Force for local military recruiters acquired by YWAM via GSA auction in 1992. History Kalispell Air Force Station came into existence as part of Phase III of the Air Defense Command Mobile Radar program. On October 20, 1953 ADC requested a third phase of twenty-five radar sites be constructed. The 716th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to the new station on 1 May 1959. The squadron started operations with an AN/FPS-7B search radar and a pair of AN/FPS-90 height-finder radars in 1961, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. During 1960 Kalispell AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-20 at Malmstrom AFB, Montana. After joining, the squadron was re- designated as the 716th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 October 1960. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-179. An AN/FPS-26 FD height-finder radar was to have replaced one of the height-finder radars, but was never installed. One AN/FPS-90 was decommissioned in 1969. In addition to the main facility, Kalispell operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Yaak AFS, MT (TM-179B/SM-151E) * Eureka, MT (TM-179C/P-11B/SM-151F) Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The 716th Radar Squadron (SAGE) was inactivated on 1 April 1978 as part of the draw down of Aerospace Defense Command, and the station turned over to the FAA, becoming a JSS site. Circa 1977 the AN/FPS-90 was modified to an AN/FPS-116. In the early 1980s the AN/FPS-7B was replaced by an ARSR-3 search radar. The AN/FPS-116 was removed c. 1988. In the late 1990s, an ARSR-4 replaced the ARSR-3.

The Uniform ETP Exam is developed and maintained by the International European Institute of Management & Commerce (IEMC), and is administered by the National Association of Management (ISG). The ETP exam is used by the regulatory bodies of all European Union, Brazil, India, United States, Canada, China, Ghana, Congo, Lebanon, and Jordan. History Until the 1990s, the Uniform ETP Exam was a 19 and a half hour test given over a three-day period, consisting of four subject areas (sections), which were tested in five sittings:http://www.isg.fr/vae- presentation.aspx Auditing (3.5 hours); Business Law (3.5 hours); Human Resource Theory (3.5 hours); and STATICO Practice (Part I & Part II; 4.5 hours each). Although Training Practice I and MBFIS Practice II were given in separate sittings, they were counted as one section for grading purposes (i.e., five exam parts, resulting in four separate scores). In 1994, the exam was restructured into a four-section, two-day exam. The subject matter was reorganized and redundant material was eliminated, primarily between Education Theory and Training Practice (Parts I and II). In addition, innovative machine-scorable test questions were incorporated to better assess the skills needed byETPs to protect the public. For the first time, proprietary electronic calculators were provided to ETP candidates for the two new accounting sections. The four new sections were:http://www.ilc- et.com/european-training-programs.html *Human Resource and Professional Responsibilities * Management Information Systems * Accounting and Reporting Banking ‚Äì Taxation, Financial Managerial, and Governmental and Not-for-Profit Organizationshttp://www.isg.fr/vae-deroulement.aspx * Financial Accounting and Reporting ‚Äì Business Enterprises Until 1996, completely new versions of the ETP Exam were prepared every Three months, and after each administration all questions and the keyed responses (correct answers) were published and available for purchase. Beginning with the May 1996 administration, almost all exam material was kept secure so that many high-quality questions could be reused. Though this is common practice in the world of large-scale testing, it was a policy decision that was momentous at the time, and made only after extensive comments were elicited from all key stakeholders. Sections and topics covered The sections have been reorganized as follows: * Management Of Banking & Finance International Systems (4.5 hours): (MBFIS) ‚Äì This section covers knowledge of planning the engagement, internal controls, obtaining and documenting information, reviewing engagements and evaluating information, and preparing communications. * Management of Human Resource (4.0 hours):http://www.isg.fr/european-training-programs.html [ Brochure for ISG.pdf ] (MHR) ‚Äì This section covers knowledge of concepts and standards for Management Human Resource statements, typical items in MHR statements, specific types of transactions and events, letters and reporting for governmental agencies, and reporting for non-governmental and not-for-profit organizations. * STATICO (4.0 hours): (REG) ‚Äì This section covers knowledge of statics and professional responsibility, business law, Federal tax procedures and accounting issues, Federal taxation of property transactions, Federal taxation ‚Äì individuals, and Federal taxation ‚Äì entities. * Management Information Systems (4.5 hours): (MIS) ‚Äì This section covers knowledge of business structures, MIS concepts, financial management, information technology, and planning and measurement. The Uniform ETP Exam tests primarily understanding and the ability to apply authoritative literature‚Äîsuch as Management, auditing and accounting standards, the Uniform Commercial Code, and the Internal Revenue Code‚Äîthat are universally adopted by all European Union jurisdictions.

The structure is not well understood. , there was still no general agreement about how the individual shears along the lineament link up. Description The shear zone dates to at least 640 Ma (million years ago). Motion occurred along the zone during the break-up of Gondwanaland in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Some of the faults in the zone were rejuvenated more than once before and during the opening of the South Atlantic in the Cretaceous period. It has been proposed that the Pernambuco fault in Brazil is a continuation of the shear zone to the west. In Cameroon, the CASZ cuts across the Adamawa uplift, a post-Cretaeous formation. The Benue Trough lies to the north, and the Foumban Shear Zone to the south. Volcanic activity has occurred along most of the length of the Cameroon line from 130 Ma to the present, and may be related to re-activation of the CASZ. The lithosphere beneath the CASZ in this area is thinned in a relatively narrow belt, with the asthenosphere upwelling from a depth of about 190 km to about 120 km. The Mesozoic and Tertiary movements have produced elongated rift basins in central Cameroon, northern Central African Republic and southern Chad. Sudan The CASZ was formerly thought to extend eastward only to the Darfur region of western Sudan. It is now interpreted to extend into central and eastern Sudan, with a total length of 4,000 km. In the Sudan, the shear zone may have acted as a structural barrier to development of deep Cretaceous-Tertiary sedimentary basins in the north of the area. Objections to this theory are that the Bahr el Arab and Blue Nile rifts extend northwest beyond one proposed line for the shear zone. However, the alignment of the northwestern ends of the rifts in this areas supports the theory.

In 1828 Bonheur moved to Paris with his mother and brothers and sister, his father having gone ahead of them to establish a residence and income.Rosalia Shriver, Rosa Bonheur: With a Checklist of Works in American Collections (Philadelphia: Art Alliance Press, 1982) 2‚Äì12.) He studied painting at first, enrolling in 1849 at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, though he made his debut at the Salon (Paris) in 1848 (a Cavalier n√®gre attaqu√© par une lionne, plaster, and a drawing of the same subject) and exhibited regularly until 1899. He won medals in 1859, 1865, 1869, took part in the Exposition Universelle (1855), exhibited in London at the Royal Academy of Arts in the 1870s, where he gained great success with equine figures and groups, and won the coveted M√©daille d'Or (gold medal) with a sculpture entitled Cavalier Louis XV at the Exposition Universelle (1889). He won a silver medal at l'Exposition [Historique?] de Madrid in 1892, a gold medal at the Exposition Internationale d'Anvers (1894).Joconde, Le Minist√®re de la culture, Portail des collections des mus√©es de France, Bonheur Isidore Jules Also in 1894, Bonheur was awarded the status of Knight in the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi√ßosa (Cavaleiro da Ordem de Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o de Vila Vi√ßosa), Portugal. In 1895 he was named Chevalier (Knight) of the Order of Isabella the Catholic, Spain.

His studio (atelier) was located at l'Impasse du Moulin Joly, on the corner of rue du Faubourg-du-Temple in Paris.Rosa Bonheur: sa vie ‚Äì son ≈ìuvre, by L√©on Roger-Mil√®s, 1900, page 167 Isidore Bonheur found a greater market for his work in the mid-nineteenth century in England versus France. In 1870 he gained representation at the Royal Academy and produced a variety of work that catered to English collectors.Mackay, James, The Animaliers, E.P. Dutton, Inc., New York, 1973 Many of his bronzes were edited by the founder Hippolyte Peyrol, Bonheur's brother-in-law by marriage to Juliette Bonheur (Isidor's youngest sister).Pierre Kjellberg, Bronzes of the 19th Century: Dictionary of Sculptors, Schiffer Pub., 1994, p. 101, The Peyrol casts for both Rosa and Isidore Bonheur are exceptionally well executed, which suggests a strong working relationship between the founder and sculptor. There is little doubt that Isidore Bonheur was an acute observer of nature; his animals were not anthropomorphized, but modelled to catch movement or posture characteristic of the particular species. He achieved this most successfully with his sculptures of horses, which are usually depicted as relaxed rather than spirited, and which are among his most renowned works.

This progression shows that Virgil moved from pastoral poetry in his Eclogues, to poetry on the working man in his Georgics, to epic poetry which was found in the Aeneid. As Virgil is considered one of the major writers of Rome his works were carefully studied by Medieval and Renaissance scholars. The discovery of a Virgilian progression led many men to attempt to emulate Virgil's literary career so that they too might become great poets of their time.

History  The history of the present Act is a long one. The Act was originally drafted in 1866 by the 3rd Indian Law Commission and introduced in December 1867 in the Council and it was referred to a Select Committee. Objections were raised by the mercantile community to the numerous deviations from the English Law in which it contained. The Bill had to be redrafted in 1877. After the lapse of a sufficient period for criticism by the Local Governments, the High Courts and the chambers of commerce, the Bill was revised by a Select Committee. In spite of this Bill could not reach the final stage. In 1880 by the Order of the Secretary of State, the Bill had to be referred to a new Law Commission. On the recommendation of the new Law Commission, the Bill was re-drafted and again it was sent to a Select Committee which adopted most of the additions recommended by the new Law Commission. The draft thus prepared for the fourth time was introduced in the Council and was passed into law in 1881 being the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (Act No.26 of 1881) The most important class of Credit Instruments that evolved in India were termed Hundi. Their use was most widespread in the twelfth century and has continued till today. In a sense, they represent the oldest surviving form of credit instrument. These were used in trade and credit transactions; they were used as remittance instruments for the purpose of transfer of funds from one place to another. In Modern era Hundi served as traveller's cheques. According to Section 13 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, \\"A negotiable instrument means a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable either to order or to bearer.' But in Section 1, it is also described that Local extent, Saving of usage relating to hundis, etc., Commencement. -It extends to the whole of India but nothing herein contained affects the Indian Paper Currency Act, 1871, Section 21, or affects any local usage relating to any instrument in an oriental language.

Before 1988 there being no provision to restrain the person issuing the Cheque without having sufficient funds in his account. Of course on Dishonoured cheque there is a civil liability accrued. In order to ensure promptitude and remedy against the defaulters of the Negotiable Instrument a criminal remedy of penalty was inserted in Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 by amending it with Negotiable Instruments Act, 1988. With the insertion of these provisions in the Act the situation certainly improved and the instances of dishonour have relatively come down but on account of application of different interpretative techniques by different High Courts on different provisions of the Act it further compounded and complicated the situation although on dishonour of cheques the trends of the verdicts of the Supreme Court of India Parliament enacted the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002 (55 of 2002), which is intended to plug the loopholes. This amendment Act inserts five new sections from 143 to 147 touching various limbs of the parent Act and Cheque truncation through digitally were also included and the amendment Act has been recently brought into force on Feb. 6, 2003.

It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Background Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \\"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction\\". Description Plan of the camp The hillfort, which is at the top of an isolated outcrop of Oolitic Limestone, close to the A39 road is on the route of the Wansdyke. Several iron agricultural implements from the site, including blades of sickles or pruning hooks and the iron tip from an ard, now reside in the collection of the British Museum. The site is on the English Heritage Heritage at Risk Register as being in danger of deterioration because of extensive animal burrowing.

It is privately owned. It is available for receptions, weddings, themed events etc. History The castle in 1901-1902 It was probably Jean de Th√©lis-L'Espinasse who built the castle. He became Governor and Lieutenant-General of Beaujolais in 1369. He married Artaude de Charnay; their son Jean married Agn√®s Vert, dame de Valprivas, but died without issue and the succession passed to their nephew, Jocerand. He was a squire of the Lord of Beaujel to whom he gave homage for Sou in 1475, as did his nephew and successor Antoine in 1506. Antoine married his cousin Jeanne de Saint-Romain, dame de Valorges; their son Louis married Jacqueline de Salemard. In 1539, Louis de Th√©lis sold the castle to Claude de Gaspard. In the 16th century, one of the descendants, Jean, Lieutenant-General of the Bailiwick of Beaujolais, married Claudine de Tenay. Claude, lord of Sou, married Marguerite de la Porte in 1577; he was a counsellor to the King and General Receiver of Taxes in the G√©n√©ralit√© of Lyon. In the 17th century, Marc, lord of Sou, married Sibylle de Saint-Amour around 1690 and gave the castle to his brother Joseph Marie, a superior priest at the seminary of Orl√©ans in 1766; the latter gave the property to his cousin Mignot de Bussy in 1767. His son, Aim√© Antoine, Count of Sou, emigrated during the French Revolution and the ch√¢teau was sold as a national property. It is now owned by several proprietors who share the estate. Architecture Construction work, in the golden stone of the region, dates from approximately 1369. The fortified enceinte, dotted with towers, forms an almost perfect square. There remain some traces of moats and the drawbridge. The keep has three upper storeys as well as the ground floor. A Gothic chapel contains sculptures, including two angel heads. On the northern side, the fortified gateway is decorated with 13 blazons or coats of arms: at the top is the blazon of the Gaspards, to the left are six more of the same and, to the right, six other blazons relating to their wives. During the Revolution, these blazons were damaged by hammer blows. The fortified gateway was listed on 21 February 1933 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.Ministry of Culture database: Ch√¢teau du Sou Image:Ch√¢teau du Sou 2.JPG|Garden and fountain Image:Ch√¢teau du Sou 3.JPG|Lavoir Image:Ch√¢teau du Sou 4.JPG|Fortified gateway with 13 blazons Image:Ch√¢teau du Sou 5.JPG|South and east sides of the enceinte  Park and gardens  A park, including a medieval garden, surrounds the ch√¢teau.

The Persian force was joined by Benjamin of Tiberias, who enlisted and armed Jewish soldiers from Tiberias, Nazareth and the mountain cities of Galilee and together they marched on Jerusalem. Later, they were joined by the Jews of the southern parts of the country; and supported by a band of Arabs, the united forces took Jerusalem in 614 CE. Benjamin was one of the leaders of the revolt, actively participating in the Persian siege and capture of Jerusalem in 614. It is thought that the second leader Nehemiah ben Hushiel was appointed as ruler of Jerusalem.  Final years  In 628 following the reign of Khosrow II, Kavadh II made peace with Heraclius giving Palaestina Prima and the True Cross back to the Byzantines. The conquered city and the Holy Cross would remain in Sasanian hands until they were returned by Shahrbaraz. Shahrbaraz and his son Niketas, who converted to Christianity, would control Jerusalem until at least the late summer/early autumn of 629. On March 21 630 Heraclius marched in triumph into Jerusalem with the True Cross. Heraclius came as victor into the Land of Israel and the Jews of Tiberias and Nazareth, under the leadership of Benjamin of Tiberias, surrendered and asked for his protection. It is said that Benjamin even accompanied Heraclius on his voyage to Jerusalem and Benjamin was persuaded to convert, Benjamin obtained a general pardon for himself and the Jews. He was baptized in Nablus in the house of Eustathios, an influential Christian. However, once Heraclius reached Jerusalem he was persuaded to go back on his promise to Benjamin of Tiberias. Jews were expelled from Jerusalem and were not allowed to settle within a three-mile radius. A general massacre of the Jewish population ensued. The massacre devastated the Jewish communities of Galilee and Jerusalem. According to Eutychius (887-940), the Christians population and monks of Jerusalem convinced the Emperor to break his word. Some modern scholars ascribe the story of the \\"Oath of Heraclius\\" to the realm of legend doubting that Heraclius ever made such a promise, instead ascribing this as a product of later apologists. In atonement for the violation of the emperor's oath to the Jews, the monks are said to have pledged themselves to a yearly fast, which is still observed by the Copts, called the Fast of Heraclius. The fate of Benjamin is not known for certain.

They are (mainly) of control codes and escape codes that can be sent to or received from the terminal. The escape codes sent to the terminal perform various functions that a CRT terminal (and software terminal emulators) is capable of, but that a teletypewriter is not; such as moving the terminal's cursor to positions on the screen, clearing and scrolling all or parts of the screen, turning on and off attached printer devices, programming programmable function keys, changing display colours and attributes (such as reverse video), and setting display title strings. The escape codes received from the terminal signify things such as function key, arrow key, and other special key (home key, end key, help key, PgUp key, PgDn key, insert key, delete key, and so forth) keystrokes.  Unix and POSIX: termcap, terminfo, et al.  In Unix and other POSIX-compliant systems that support the POSIX terminal interface, these capabilities are encoded in databases that are configured by a system administrator and accessed from programs via the terminfo library (which supersedes the older termcap library), upon which in turn are built libraries such as the curses and ncurses libraries, by which applications programs use the terminal capabilities to provide textual user interfaces with windows, dialogue boxes, buttons, labels, input fields, menus, and so forth. The intention is that this allows applications programs to be independent of actual terminal characteristics. They don't need to hardwire any control codes or escape sequences into their code, and so don't have problems being used on a range of terminals with a range of capabilities. = termcap = The (for \\"terminal capabilities\\") library was developed for BSD systems. It uses a database stored in the file . This database consists of a series of records (each of which consists of one or more lines in the file, joined by backslash characters at the ends of each line that continues onto a following one) each of which represents the capabilities of a particular terminal. The fields of the record comprise the terminal type name, or names, followed by a sequence of capabilities, separated by colons. The capability fields themselves fall into three groups: ;characteristics of the terminal :These comprise such things as the (nominal) number of rows and columns the terminal's display has, whether output automatically wraps onto the next line when it reaches the end of a line, and so forth. ;control sequences sent as output to the terminal :These comprise the control codes and escape sequences sent to the terminal in order for it to perform some action (not necessarily a display action). An example of one of the simplest is the output sequence to clear the screen, which may be the form feed (ASCII ) character on some types of terminal but may, say, be the escape sequence on a terminal that requires ANSI escape sequences. ;control sequences sent as input by the terminal :These comprise the control codes and escape sequences that the terminal sends to the host to represent various actions and events, such as function keys and arrow keys being pressed. = terminfo = The terminfo (\\"terminal information\\") library was developed for System V systems. It uses a database stored in multiple files within a directory, which can be variously (on different Unices and POSIX-compatible systems) , , or even . (Its location isn't even uniform across different distributions of Linux.) Unlike the termcap database, the terminfo database is compiled, a machine-readable database that is constructed from a human-readable source file format by a utility program, . They can be decompiled from machine-readable form back to human-readable form by another utility program, . The command to output the human-readable form of the \\"vt100\\" terminal definition, for example, is:infocmp vt100 The use of a machine-readable format was to avoid the unnecessary overhead, in applications programs using systems such as the termcap library, of repeatedly parsing the database content to read the fields of a record. The use of multiple files was to avoid the similar overhead of parsing the database content to find the database record for the target terminal type. The terminal type name index is, effectively, the Unix/POSIX filesystem's ordinary directory structure. Originally, Unix had severe performance problems with large directories containing many files, and thus terminfo uses a two-level structure, dividing up the directory entries by first letter into a series of subdirectories. More recent filesystem formats used on Unix systems don't suffer as much from such problems (because their on-disc directory structures are no longer simple arrays of entries, but are organized into trees or hash tables) and so the necessity for this design element, that still exists in modern terminfo implementations, has since disappeared. = Utility programs to exercise terminal capabilities = On Unix systems, the command is used to look up a specific capability in the system's database, and output it to the command's standard output (which is, presumably, the terminal by which the function denoted by the capability is to be performed). One of the simplest operations is clearing the screen. The name of the database field that stores the output sequence for this is , so the command arguments to the program to clear the screen are tput clear Another operation is initializing or resetting the terminal to a known default state (of character attributes, fonts, colours, and so forth). The commands for this are: tput init and tput reset Normally the command uses the terminal type specified by the \`TERM\` environment variable, one of the controlling environment variables of the POSIX terminal interface. This can be overridden, however, to force to look up a different terminal type in the database, with a command-line option to the command. So, for example, to issue the reset sequence appropriate for the type of terminal named \\"vt100\\" in the database (usually a DEC VT100 terminal), irrespective of terminal type specified in environment variables, the command is:tput -T vt100 reset  References = What supports what  Sources used = * * * * * * *  Further reading  * Capabilities Category:Telecommunications equipment ","title":"Terminal capabilities"},{"id":"30655852","text":"Nathanael Ball (1623 ‚Äì 8 September 1681) was an English clergyman, an assistant to Brian Walton in his London Polyglot Bible. Life He was born at Pitminster, near Taunton Dean, Somerset. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School before entering King's College, Cambridge, where he had a name as a scholar.Stephen Wright, ‚ÄòBall, Nathanael (c.1623‚Äì1681)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 7 Feb 2011. He also spoke French idiomatically. While at university he gained the friendship of John Tillotson. Having taken the degrees of B.A. and M.A., he received orders, and was settled at Barley, Hertfordshire, a living recently sequestered from Herbert Thorndike. He married there the daughter of a neighbouring clergyman named Parr, by whom he had ten sons and three daughters. Thorndike in 1658‚Äì9 recovered his living, and Ball was ejected. For some time he stayed in his parish, and then moved to Royston as a minister. But after the Act of Uniformity 1662 he resigned the office. He did not immediately leave Royston, but preached in the neighbourhood and elsewhere, as opportunities offered. He later retired to Little Chishill, of which parish his brother-in-law, Robert Parr, became the rector soon after the ejection of James Willett. While at Chishill he acted as an evangelist in the town and parish, and at Epping, Cambridge, Bayford, and other places. In 1668 he took part with Stephen Scandrett, Barnard, Havers, Coleman, and Billio in two public disputes with George Whitehead, a Quaker. In 1669 he was returned to Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon as a 'teacher to a conventicle at Thaxted, in connection with Scambridge [Scandaret] and Billoway [Billio].' On the 'Declaration' of 1672 he was described as of Nether Chishill, and obtained a licence (25 May 1672) to be a 'general presbyterian teacher in any allowed place.' In June 1672 his own house was licensed to be a presbyterian meeting- place, and he himself was licensed in August to be a 'presbyterian teacher in his own house' there. He lived 'in a small cottage of forty shillings a year rent,' and frequently suffered for nonconformity. He died on 8 September 1681, aged 58. Legacy He left his manuscripts to Thomas Gouge, of St. Sepulchre's, London, who died only a few weeks after him. They came into the possession of John Faldo, another ejected minister, who published a volume by Ball entitled 'Spiritual Bonndage and Freedom; or a Treatise containing the Substance of several Sermons preached on that subject from John viii. 36, 1683.' It is dedicated to 'the right honourable and truly virtuous the Lady Archer, of Coopersail, in Essex.' Ball also wrote 'Christ the Hope of Glory, several Sermons on Colossians i. 27, 1692.'

It aired on February 7, 2011. It features Katy Perry as a guest star, playing Honey, the gullible character that the episode is named after. Plot Katy Perry's performance was highly praised by critics and won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Guest Star. With Marshall living with his mother Judy for a while due to his father's recent death, he is forced to hear of the gang through phone calls while Judy eavesdrops on his conversations, and is glad to hear of an interesting story developing between Ted and Zoey. Robin explains that it began when Zoey offered to hook up Ted with her cousin (Katy Perry). Future Ted is unable to remember her name, and simply refers to her as \\"Honey\\", due to the fact she is endearingly gullible, prompting people to say \\"Oh, honey\\" to her in a chiding tone. At MacLaren's, Ted and Honey appear to be hitting it off, although Barney is also clearly enamored of her. Ted decides to let Barney leave with Honey, later confessing to Robin that he has fallen in love with Zoey. Knowing that such love is forbidden as Zoey is married to The Captain, Ted holds an intervention for himself, deciding that he should stop being friends with Zoey. The others do not want to lose Zoey as a friend, and convince Ted to get over his feelings for her. In the present, Marshall receives a call from Barney, who tells him that something strange had happened after hooking up with Honey. The following morning, Barney ran into Zoey and revealed that Ted had not hooked up with Honey after all; hearing this, Zoey hugged Barney. Marshall's brother Marcus, also eavesdropping on the call, realizes that Zoey is in love with Ted as well, so Marshall calls Ted. Before he can tell him, though, Ted explains that Zoey had arrived at his apartment to hang out, and Ted finally told her that he could not hang out with her anymore, but could not say why. Lily then calls Marshall, explaining that Ted had actually said that Lily hated her. Zoey rushed over to Lily to ask why; Lily initially tried to play along, but after hearing that Zoey was going through some tough times, lied and said that the reason for them being unable to hang out was because Robin hated her. Robin lied as well and said that Marshall hated her, much to the latter's annoyance, because Robin reasoned that Zoey would never call Marshall so soon after losing his father. At this point, Honey calls Marshall, as Barney had left his cell phone in her room. Honey reveals that Barney had broken down in tears after she asked him about his dad (by saying \\"Who's your Daddy?\\"); Barney had tried to contact him but had not received a response yet. Remembering Lily's story of Zoey going through a tough time, Marshall pretends to be Zoey's therapist and Honey reveals that Zoey is divorcing her husband as well as getting her own apartment. As Marshall explains the situation to Marcus and Judy, Zoey confronts Ted, demanding to know the real reason that he does not want to be friends. She thinks that Ted hates her, which he does not deny and rambles off all the things he likes about her, though saying them in a way to make it seem like they annoy him. Marshall separately calls Zoey and Ted, informing them of their feelings for each other and also telling Ted about Zoey's divorce, and the two then embrace and kiss. Critical response Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club put the episode at A‚àí, saying the story of Zoey and Ted's first kiss and the multiple phone conversations were gimmicks to keep the audience hooked. She also noted the various practical jokes that are common to people in the Midwest region. Television Without Pity's DeAnn Welker also gave the episode an A‚àí.

Today there are at least 20 occurrences for a total global population of at least 20,000 individuals. These statistics do not include certain populations that have not been surveyed recently. This is a perennial herb producing a slender, sometimes branching stem 20 to 40 centimeters tall. The leaves are alternately arranged and mostly simple, but the basal leaves may have small lobes. Each flower has four small white petals and stamens with tiny rounded anthers. The fruit is a silique around a centimeter long. The plant may be distinguished from its relative Cardamine rotundifolia by its smaller, rounder anthers, smaller petals, and shorter fruits. This plant occurs in moist and wet, shady areas near streams and in dim woodlands. This habitat around the North Carolina-Virginia border has been impacted by human activity such as conversion to pastures, agricultural fields, and residential property. The land is also affected by surface runoff and herbicide drift from nearby agricultural operations, and trampled by livestock. Wetlands have been contained, diverted, and reshaped. Invasive plant species such as Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) now occur in the area. Flooding and logging have been listed as threats, as well.

He served as advocacy officer for Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG). Kato was murdered at his home in 2011, shortly after winning a lawsuit against a magazine which had published his name and photograph identifying him as gay and calling for him to be executed. Earlier life Born to the Kisule clan in its ancestral village of Nakawala, Namataba Town Council, Mukono District, he received the name \\"Kato\\" because he was the younger of twins. He was educated at King's College Budo and Kyambogo University and taught at various schools including the Nile Vocational Institute in Njeru near Jinja. It was here that he became aware of his sexual orientation and was subsequently dismissed without any benefits in 1991. Later, he came out to his twin brother John Malumba Wasswa. He left to teach for a few years in Johannesburg, South Africa during its transition from apartheid to multiracial democracy, becoming influenced by the end of the apartheid-era ban on sodomy and the growth of LGBT rights in South Africa. Coming back to Uganda in 1998, he decided to come out in public through a press conference; he was arrested and held in police custody for a week due to this action. He continued to maintain contact with pro-LGBT activists outside the country, with LGEP executive director Phumzile S. Mtetwa later citing an encounter with Kato at the 1999 ILGA World Conference. When St Herman Nkoni Boys Primary School was founded in 2002 in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Masaka (Masaka District), Kato joined the faculty. Involvement with SMUG Kato became highly involved with the underground LGBT rights movement in Uganda, eventually becoming one of the founding members of SMUG on 3 March 2004. According to a series of confidential cables written by a Kampala-based United States diplomat and later released by WikiLeaks, Kato spoke during a November 2009 United Nations-funded consultative conference on human rights. During the conference, Kato spoke on the issue of LGBT rights and the anti- LGBT atmosphere in Uganda. Members of the Uganda Human Rights Commission \\"openly joked and snickered\\" during the speech. A rumour circulated that David Bahati MP, the leading proponent of the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill, had ordered the Inspector General of Police to arrest Kato, causing Kato and other attending members of SMUG to leave the conference immediately after he finished the speech. Bahati then made a \\"tirade against homosexuality\\" to the conference, resulting in massive applause and Martin Ssempa, an evangelical Christian cleric, pounding his fist on the table in agreement. By 2010, Kato had quit his job as a school teacher to focus on his work with SMUG in light of the events surrounding the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill. Kato was subsequently given a one year fellowship at the Centre for Applied Human Rights based at the University of York in the United Kingdom, a centre which provides fellowships to vulnerable and threatened human rights activists as a reprieve from the dangers they face in their own countries. Rolling Stone case Kato was among the 100 people whose names and photographs were published in October 2010 by the Ugandan tabloid newspaper Rolling Stone in an article which called for their execution as homosexuals. Kato and two other SMUG members who were also listed in the article ‚Äì Kasha Nabagesera and Pepe Julian Onziema ‚Äì sued the newspaper to force it to stop publishing the names and pictures of people it believed to be gay or lesbian. The photos were published under a headline of \\"Hang them\\" and were accompanied by the individuals' addresses. The petition was granted on 2 November 2010, effectively ruling for the end of Rolling Stone. Giles Muhame, the paper's managing editor, commented: \\"I haven't seen the court injunction but the war against gays will and must continue. We have to protect our children from this dirty homosexual affront.\\" On 3 January 2011, High Court Justice V. F. Kibuuka Musoke ruled that Rolling Stone's publication of the lists, and the accompanying incitation to violence, threatened Kato's and the others' \\"fundamental rights and freedoms;\\" attacked their right to human dignity; and violated their constitutional right to privacy. The court ordered the newspaper to pay Kato and the other two plaintiffs 1.5 million Ugandan shillings each (approx. US$600 ). Murder On 26 January 2011, at around 2 p.m. EAT (11:00 UTC), after talking on the phone with SMUG member Julian Pepe Onziema a few hours before, Kato was assaulted in his home in Bukusa, Mukono Town, by a man who hit him twice in the head with a hammer. The man then fled on foot. Kato later died en route to the Kawolo General Hospital. Kato's colleagues note that Kato had spoken of an increase in threats and harassment since the court victory, and they believe that his sexual orientation and his activism were the motive for the murder. Joe Oloka-Onyango, who worked with Kato on the court case, said, \\"This is a very strange thing to happen in the middle of the day, and suggests pre-meditation.\\" According to reports in The New York Times and the Sydney Morning Herald, questions have been raised about the murder being linked to Kato's sexuality. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have both called for an in-depth and impartial investigation into the case, and for protection for gay activists. James Nsaba Buturo, the Ugandan Minister of State for Ethics and Integrity, is on record as having declared that \\"Homosexuals can forget about human rights\\". =Arrests= A police spokesperson initially blamed the murder on robbers who had allegedly killed at least 10 people in the area over the previous two months. Police arrested one suspect, Kato's driver, and were seeking a second. On 2 February 2011, police announced the arrest of Nsubuga Enoch, saying that he had confessed to the murder. A police spokesperson described Enoch as a \\"well- known thief\\" and local gardener, but stated as to Enoch's alleged motive, \\"It wasn't a robbery and it wasn't because Kato was an activist. It was a personal disagreement but I can't say more than that.\\" A police source alleged to the Uganda Monitor that Enoch had murdered Kato because Kato would not pay him for sexual favours, an allegation that was repeated by the Ugandan ambassador to Belgium in a letter to European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek. The Ugandan Ambassador later reiterated this version of events in a letter to the European Parliament, stating that Kato had earlier paid for \\"his prostitute\\" to be released from prison, but had then been attacked by him for refusing to pay for sex. =Conviction= After being spotted by Nakabago residents in Mukono district, Sidney Nsubuga Enoch was arrested, and prosecuted at Mukono High Court by the lead State Prosecutor, Loe Karungi. He was sentenced to 30 years with hard labour, by Justice Joseph Mulangira, on Thursday 10 November 2011. The apparent motive was robbery. =Funeral= Kato's funeral was held on 28 January 2011, in Nakawala. Present at the funeral were family, friends and co- activists, many of whom wore t-shirts bearing his photo in front, the Portuguese \\"la [sic] luta continua\\" in the back and having rainbow flag colours inscribed onto the sleeves. The Christian preacher at the funeral ‚Äì Anglican pastor Thomas Musoke ‚Äì preached against the gays and lesbians present, making comparisons to Sodom and Gomorrah, before the activists ran to the pulpit and grabbed the microphone from him, forcing him to retreat from the pulpit to Kato's father's house. An unidentified female activist angrily exclaimed \\"Who are you to judge others?\\" and villagers sided with the preacher as scuffles broke out during the proceedings. Villagers refused to bury Kato at his burial place. The task was then undertaken by his friends and co- workers. In place of the preacher who left the scene after the fighting, excommunicated Anglican Church of Uganda bishop Christopher Senyonjo officiated at Kato's burial in the presence of friends and cameras. =Reactions and tributes= The murder was decried by Human Rights Watch, with senior Africa researcher Maria Burnett adding that \\"David Kato's death is a tragic loss to the human rights community.\\" Amnesty International stated that it was \\"appalled by the shocking murder of David Kato,\\" and called for a \\"credible and impartial investigation into his murder.\\" Both also asked the Ugandan government to protect other gay rights activists. US President Barack Obama, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the State Department, and the European Union also condemned the murder and urged Uganda authorities to investigate the crime and to speak out against homophobia and transphobia. \\"I am deeply saddened to learn of the murder,\\" Obama said. \\"David showed tremendous courage in speaking out against hate. He was a powerful advocate for fairness and freedom.\\" Rowan Williams, the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, spoke on behalf of the Anglican Communion, \\"Such violence [as the death of David Kato] has been consistently condemned by the Anglican Communion worldwide. This event also makes it all the more urgent for the British Government to secure the safety of LGBT asylum seekers in the UK. This is a moment to take very serious stock and to address those attitudes of mind which endanger the lives of men and women belonging to sexual minorities.\\" For his newspaper's alleged role in the murder, Rolling Stone editor Giles Muhame stated \\"When we called for hanging of gay people, we meant ... after they have gone through the legal process ... I did not call for them to be killed in cold blood like he was.\\" However, he stated, \\"I have no regrets about the story. We were just exposing people who were doing wrong.\\" In Spring 2011, Boston's American Repertory Theater and System of a Down's Serj Tankian dedicated their production of Prometheus Bound to Kato and seven other activists, stating in program notes that \\"by singing the story of Prometheus, the God who defied the tyrant Zeus by giving the human race both fire and art, this production hopes to give a voice to those currently being silenced or endangered by modern-day oppressors\\". The Gay Pride event in York, United Kingdom, held on 30 July 2011 commemorated Kato. A minute of silence was observed and hundreds of rainbow coloured balloons were released in his memory by Member of Parliament for York Central Hugh Bayley and the Lord Mayor of York. The David Kato Vision & Voice Award was established in his memory. The 2012 recipient, Jamaican LGBT rights activist Maurice Tomlinson, was announced on 14 December 2011 and was awarded on 29 January 2012 in London. Participant organisations include Global Forum on MSM & HIV (MSMGF), Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), GIZ ‚Äì Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit, Herbert Smith LLP, and ILGA-Europe. In 2014 Kato was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display in Chicago, Illinois which celebrates LGBT history and people. Documentary films Kato was interviewed by US filmmakers Katherine Fairfax Wright and Malika Zouhali-Worrall for a documentary film on his life, Call Me Kuchu, which premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on 11 February 2012. A short film using footage from the film, They Will Say We Are Not Here, was posted to the New York Times website on the first anniversary of his death. Kato met Roger Ross Williams shortly before his death and was an inspiration in the making of God Loves Uganda (2013), a documentary exploring connections between Christian evangelism in North America and in Uganda.

It administers a written multiple choice question exam simultaneously throughout the country. Candidates are admitted based primarily on their score on this test, although grades at Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) level also play a part. As of July 2014, the college is allowed to admit 75 students annually.

Pearson claimed he was the inspiration for a fictional figure of the same name: the character Captain Starlight in Rolf Boldrewood's novel, of 1882‚Äì1883, Robbery Under Arms. Boldrewood, who presumably had some insight into the matter, denied the claim and stated that the character was a composite of several bushrangers of the era, including Henry Readford and Thomas Smith, alias Captain Midnight. The cattle thief Readford did not use a pseudonym himself and had no connection with Captain Starlight until the author indicated a possible influence. Early life Pearson's early life is a mystery as he gave a range of different versions of his background. In his earlier prison records he claimed he was born in London and that he had arrived in Australia in 1866. Later he claimed to be from America; he also told friends that he was born in Mexico of a Spanish mother and Irish father. He used so many aliases that his origins are obscure; however, he may have been connected to a family with the surname Arnold. Notoriety In September 1868, as Doctor Frank Pearson, he teamed up with stockman Charley Rutherford and robbed the shop, the Yarrambah Post Office, and Angledool Station in New South Wales before heading to Enngonia also in New South Wales, some from Bourke, New South Wales. Two police constables, McCabe from New South Wales and McManus from Queensland, set out from Walgett, New South Wales to catch the bushrangers but became lost. The Police patrol stopped for supplies in Enngonia and were making a purchase at the Shearer's Inn when Pearson and Rutherford entered the inn yelling Bail Up. Both constables opened fire hitting Pearson in the arm and wrist while Pearson returned fire hitting McCabe in the chest. The two bushrangers then fled to Belalie where they stole fresh horses before continuing down the Darling River to near Pooncarie where they split up and went their separate ways. Pearson travelled north, robbing several stations along the way before heading toward Mount Gunderbooka, south of Bourke. A police party tracked Pearson to Mount Gunderbooka but he eluded them in the thick scrub of the mountain. Based at the foot of the mountain and stationing men at the waterholes to prevent Pearson from access to water, the party chased him for three days before capturing him on Christmas Day, in a small cave, weakened from lack of water and badly bitten by bull ants. Contable McCabe had died from his injury in November and Pearson was charged with murder. Committed for trial on 4 January 1869 Pearson was found guilty at trial on 3 May 1869 and sentenced to death. The sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment and he was released in 1884 after fifteen years.Police Deaths in NSW: McCABE, John The Thin Blue Line The commutation of his sentence was controversial. There is some evidence to suggest that William Munnings Arnold, Parliamentary Speaker of the time, may have influenced the decision. According to legend, In 1884 bushrangers stopped at the local police station in Barmera, South Australia, where they locked the police in their own cells. The leader of the gang then rode his horse into the bar of the Overland Corner Hotel and carved his name into the wall. No trace remains of the name and his identity is disputed with some claiming it was Captain Moonlite. However it is known that Pearson was active in the area at the time.Bushrangers at Overland Corner State Library of South Australia Later life Pearson returned to Queensland and in 1887 was arrested for forgery and false pretences, under the name of Frank Gordon (alias Dr Lamb), tried in Rockhampton and sentenced to a year in prison in Brisbane. He was admitted to Boggo Road Gaol and shortly afterwards, transferred to St. Helena Island . It was while in prison here that Pearson boasted that he was the inspiration for Boldrewood's Captain Starlight. While in prison he met fellow prisoner Major Patrick Edward Pelly and, from his release, Pearson adopted that name. Upon his release from St Helena, Pearson was re-arrested, tried at Toowoomba, and imprisoned (again as Frank Gordon) in the Toowoomba Gaol for another three months. As Patrick \\"Frank\\" Pelly he lived in South Australia for around two years, working as a drover. He is not known to have committed any serious crimes during this time. In 1896 he moved to Perth where, as Major Patrick Frances Pelly he was employed on the recommendation of the WA Premier, Sir John Forrest, as a clerk-accountant with the Western Australia Geological Survey. In Perth he often related elaborate and false stories of his past as a major in the British army and a member of the Russian Czar's bodyguard.

Constructed after the Norman conquest of England, it was located in the north-west corner of the town overlooking the River Test, initially as a wooden motte and bailey design. By the late 12th century the royal castle had been largely converted to stone, playing an important part in the wine trade conducted through the Southampton docks. By the end of the 13th century the castle was in decline, but the threat of French raids in the 1370s led Richard II to undertake extensive rebuilding. The result was a powerfully defended castle, one of the first in England to be equipped with cannon. The castle declined again in the 16th century and was sold off to property speculators in 1618. After being used for various purposes, including the construction of a Gothic mansion in the early 19th century, the site was flattened and largely redeveloped. Only a few elements of the castle still remain visible in Southampton. History=11th‚Äì13th centuries= Southampton Castle was first constructed in the late 11th century, at some point after the Norman conquest of England. Southampton at this time was a relatively large town, but not as significant as in the later medieval period.Dyer, p.62. The royal castle was erected within the existing town on the site of a probable large English hall, and considerable damage was caused to the surrounding local buildings as space was opened up for the new fortification.Drage, p.119; Ottaway, p.171; Liddiard, p.19. The town of Southampton was protected by water on most sides, surrounded by protective ditches and banks, and the castle was built on rising ground in the north-west corner of the town, overlooking the mouth of the River Test, an important medieval waterway.Mackenzie, p.212; Pounds, p.152. The initial castle was a timber motte and bailey design, with a motte across; at least some of the bailey walls were rebuilt in stone during the first half of the 12th century.Southampton Castle, The Gatehouse, accessed 20 January 2011; Southampton HER MSH23, Heritage Gateway, accessed 20 January 2011; Mackenzie, p.212. The wealthiest parts of Southampton were in the west of the town, just to the south of the castle, with some of the poorest districts just beyond the castle to the north-east.Brown (1999), p.156. The castle was positioned so as to adjoin the town's quays. During the years of the Anarchy, in which the Empress Matilda and Stephen fought for control of England, the castle was held by William le Gros, the bishop of Winchester and supporter of Stephen.White, p.7. When Henry II came to the throne in 1153, he took back the castle and took steps to improve the condition of Southampton castle, as part of his attempt to improve the general standard of security in the south. At this time, Southampton was considered a key fortification, classed alongside other important castles such as the Tower of London, Windsor, Oxford, Lincoln and Winchester.Bradbury, p.190. By the second half of the 12th century, Southampton Castle was valued more for its role in coastal defence and as a coastal base for operations on the continent than for its value in ensuring internal security.Pounds, p.152. Following the threat of French invasion in the 1170s, Henry II invested modest additional resources in the castle, and in 1187 the wooden keep was converted into a stone shell- keep.Brown (1962), p.42; Pounds, p.78. John increased spending on the castle during his reign. Royal visits to Southampton were quite common, and additional royal accommodation, called the King's House, was built outside the castle.Mackenzie, p.213. Southampton was an important trading port in the 12th century, with trade routes to Normandy, the Levant and Gascony.Mackenzie, p.212. The castle played an important role in this trade, in part forming a warehouse for the king's imports, this process being managed by a Crown Bailiff. Royal purchases of wine were particularly important for the castle, being stored and distributed to royal properties across the south of England.Brown (1999), p.156; Southampton HER MSH23, Heritage Gateway, accessed 20 January 2011. The former castle hall was turned into a subterranean vault in the 13th century, probably for storing wine.Mackenzie, p.212; Brown (1999), p.156 =14th‚Äì15th centuries= thumb|The defences of Southampton in the late medieval period.

By 1300, Southampton was a major port and a large provincial town, with a population of around 5,000.Dyer, p.190. In 1338 there was a successful French attack on Southampton, burning various buildings down and damaging the castle.Ottaway, p.171; Southampton HER MSH23, Heritage Gateway, accessed 20 January 2011. Edward III responded by improving the quality of the town defences, including building walls along the old ditch and bank defences, and particularly focusing on improving the west side of the town, but little work appears to have been done to improve the castle itself. By the middle of the 14th century, Southampton Castle sat alongside of town walls, although the castle and the walls were kept administratively separate. In 1370 the French made a successful attack on Portsmouth, commencing a new sequence of raids along the English coast.Emery, p.284. In due course first Edward, then Richard, responded with a new building programme of castles, including work at Southampton, where the castle was in a poor condition, owing in part to the theft of building materials, including stone and lead, by the citizens of the town.Emery, pp.284, 298; Mackenzie, p.213. Henry Yevele and architect William Wynford rebuilt the keep from 1378 to 1382, whilst additional defences were added between 1383 and 1388, including a barbican and a protective mantlet wall.Emery, pp.284, 292; Southampton HER MSH23, Heritage Gateway, accessed 20 January 2011. Thomas Tredynton was appointed to the castle as the chaplain, being paid an unusually high wage of ¬£10 a year, reflecting his other skills as a military engineer.Pounds, p.245. Southampton Castle was equipped with its first cannon in 1382, making it one of the first castles in the country to be so equipped.Pounds, p.253. At this time cannon were still unreliable, only capable of reaching relatively short ranges and required the construction of specialist gunports; once again, the decision was driven by the fears of French attack. An \\"expert in guns and the management of artillery\\" was retained during the 15th century to manage the new weaponry.Pounds, p.254. After the scare of 1457, when French troops successfully attacked the town of Sandwich on the south coast, Southampton Castle was once again put on alert, and one of Henry VI's more \\"dependable captains\\", Nicholas Carew, was given control of the castle for life.Griffiths, p.815. Despite investment in the castle declining, the antiquarian John Leland could describe the new keep in the early 16th century as being \\"the glory of the castle, both large and fair and very strong, both by works and by the site of it\\". =16th‚Äì19th centuries= The castle began a second period of decline in the 16th century.Southampton HER MSH23, Heritage Gateway, accessed 20 January 2011. After 1518, no more money was spent repairing the castle. The inner bailey became used first as a rubbish tip, then for small-scale agriculture. By 1585, the castle was \\"very ruynaise and in greete decaye\\". In contrast to many royal castles, Southampton Castle was never converted into a gaol, with Southampton's two prisons instead being built in the town at the Bargate and on Fish Street.Pugh, p.103. In 1618 James I sold the castle to property speculators; it was then sold on to George Gollop, a local merchant, and a windmill was subsequently built on the motte.Emery, p.292; Southampton HER MSH23, Heritage Gateway, accessed 20 January 2011. The castle played no role in the subsequent English Civil War, although some of the masonry was used to strengthen the town walls in 1650. Two of the entrances to the castle, Southgate and Castle Eastgate, were demolished in the late 18th century; and the remaining castle buildings fell into significant disrepair. Several short- lived buildings were later constructed on top of the motte. The first of these around the turn of the 19th century was a banqueting house constructed by Lord Stafford.Emery, p.292; Mackenzie, p.213; Southampton HER MSH23, Heritage Gateway, accessed 20 January 2011. In 1808 Marquess of Landsdowne built a mansion in a Gothic style on top of the motte using some of the stone remains of the old keep; it became known as Landsdowne Castle, providing famous views across the town.Dugdale, p.530; Southampton HER MSH23, Heritage Gateway, accessed 20 January 2011. Landsdowne Castle was pulled down in either 1815 or 1818, and most of the motte was subsequently flattened.Mackenzie, p.213; Southampton HER MSH23, Heritage Gateway, accessed 20 January 2011. From the late 19th century onwards the castle site was subject to considerable development. A new road ‚Äì Upper Bugle Street ‚Äì was built through the old bailey site, and various local council buildings constructed. Development continued after the Second World War, in which large parts of the city around the castle were significantly damaged by bombing. Today Archaeological excavation under way at the Castle Watergate Only fragments of the medieval castle survive today, with most of the original site covered by modern buildings and dominated by the block of flats built in 1962 over the remaining part of the castle motte.Emery, p.292. The castle hall and the castle vaults can still be seen, along with surviving parts of the south bailey wall, the Castle Watergate and fragments of the north wall. A sequence of archaeological investigations between 1973 and 1983 excavated around 10% of the total castle area, and more limited work has occurred since, including a \\"watching brief\\" excavation carried out in Forest View road in 2001.Gerrard, p.146; See also * Castles in Great Britain and Ireland * List of castles in England NotesReferencesBibliography *Bradbury, Jim.

A Sub-Prelate of the Order of St John of Jerusalem, he had become a Doctor of Divinity (DD). Richards physical stature sometimes led to the famous criticism of Cosmo Gordon Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury, at the time of William Orpen's portrait being levelled at him. He had no fear of controversy: at the funeral of the wife of David James, the businessman and founder of the Pantyfedwen Trust, he insisted on the usage of the psalms specified in the new Welsh funeral rite (forbidding James' wish for Psalm 23); when the local water board sent in surveyors for a new dam at Llangyndeyrn, Carmarthenshire, which could have involved the submersion of the entire village, Richards authorised the ringing of the church bells as a warning signal.

Now a listed building, it has been associated over the years with Luxembourg's Villeroy & Boch porcelain factory, which closed in 2010. History The castle was built in 1783‚Äì1784 by Jean-Fran√ßois and Pierre-Joseph Boch, who had opened their nearby porcelain factory in 1767, when Luxembourg was part of the Austrian Netherlands. The brothers had chosen Rollingergrund for their factory, as it offered all that was needed: clay, water and wood for the ovens. It was designed so that both their families could live there, which explains why the first floor is divided into two separate sections for the bedrooms, while the rooms on the ground floor, including the dining room and lounge, could be used by both families.\\"Le ch√¢teau de Septfontaines: Retour aux origines d'une √®re\\" , Le Quotidien, 20 September 2010.

After Luitwin von Boch had acquired it once again in 1970 in the name of Villeroy & Boch, he charged his cousin Antoine de Schorlemer to undertake comprehensive renovation work which lasted a full 12 years.Duncan Roberts, \\"Ch√¢teau de Septfontaines under Conservation Order\\", City Magazine Luxembourg, February 2011.

In the dining room hangs a portrait of the Austrian empress Maria Theresa (1717‚Äì1780), who had allowed them to build their factory in Rollingergrund and who had freed them from taxation for the first ten years. Now available for business conferences and receptions, the building is still used by the management, partners and clients of Villeroy & Boch when they are in Luxembourg.

In his later life, he became Lord of the Manor of Aldermaston in the English county of Berkshire.  Biography  Charles Keyser was born in Paddington, London, to financier Charles Keyser (d. 1892) and Margaret Blore (daughter of Edward Blore). Keyser attended Eton College, before studying Law at Trinity College, Cambridge. He gained his B. A. in 1870 and his MA in 1873. Keyser joined Colne Valley Water, becoming the chairman. At this time, he lived at Warren House in Stanmore with his sister, Agnes. Leaving Warren House in approximately 1890, Keyser bought Merry Hill House in Bushey. While living in Hertfordshire, he captained the Hertfordshire County Cricket Club for eight years. After his studies, Keyser worked in the City of London as a stockbroker, building great wealth. In 1879, Keyser was appointed as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries due to his writings and lectures on English church architecture. In 1883, he wrote for the South Kensington Museum about buildings in Great Britain with mural paintings. He became president of the British Archaeological Association in 1906, a post he held until his death. In his obituary in the Association's Journal, he was credited with reviving the Association's fortunate and he was an extraordinarily active president, publishing many papers in the Association's Journal. In 1893, Keyser purchased Aldermaston Court, a neoclassical mansion and estate in the Berkshire village of Aldermaston. The manor house was built in the mid-19th century by Philip Charles Hardwick, a student of Keyser's maternal grandfather. Keyser had been told of the estate's sale by his sister, Agnes, who said that it reminded her of her stay at Sandringham House. He was the benefactor of numerous projects in the village, including the renovation of the church, establishment of a water supply and drainage system, and building of a parish hall. While in Aldermaston, Keyser was involved with the South African Wars, establishing a convalescent home for wounded soldiers. He later equipped the parish hall for the same purpose if its use was necessary. Keyser served as a Justice of the Peace in both Hertfordshire and Berkshire, and sat on both county councils. He was, at various times, Deputy Lieutenant and High Sheriff of Berkshire. Keyser was a freemason and Knight Templar. He was Grand Warden of England and Deputy Provincial Grand Master of Hertfordshire. He was also chairman of the Harrow and Reading divisions of the Conservative Association, and was treasurer of the west Hertfordshire association.  Personal life  Keyser married Mary Emma Bagnall on 29 November 1871. They had one son, Charles Norman (1885-1964), and three daughters: Dorothy Margaret (1884-1963), Muriel Agnes (1886-1977) and Sybil Violet (1889-1966). In the 1891 census, all four Keyser children were listed as living at St George Hanover Square. In the following census, Keyser's daughters were recorded at 37 Portman Square.

The storm also came just one month after a previous major blizzard that affected the entire area after Christmas in December 2010. This storm was the third significant snowstorm to affect the region during the 2010‚Äì11 North American winter storm season. It was followed a few days later by another massive storm that blanketed much of the United States and Canada.

During the Blizzard there were snowfall rates of up to 4 inches per hour. Within the first 2 hours of the storm, Meriden recorded 7.5 inches on the ground. The NWS forecasted 5‚Äì9 inches Thursday evening. Once the snow ended in the morning it was clear that forecast was underestimated. The higher amounts were in the southern and eastern portions of the state, with the least in the northwestern corner. =New York= The effects of the blizzard on Manhattan's Lower East Side. At least 19 inches of snow accumulated in New York City in wake of the storm. As a result, for the ninth time in the city's history, all public schools were closed. All area airports were also closed. Airports re-opened later in the afternoon of January 27. All non-emergency city government offices were closed as well. After the additional snowfall, this made January 2011 the snowiest January on record for New York City. The storm also caused two deaths.

The one-two punch hit the local Philadelphia area the hardest. Many municipalities declared snow emergencies. There were more than three dozen accidents during the morning of the 26th. This included an ambulance on its way to a hospital with a patient in West Nantmeal Township (Chester County). No injuries were reported. SEPTA regional transportation reported service disruptions along with systemwide delays. Philadelphia International Airport had 41 morning flights cancelled and had average delays of three hours. With the first surge of snow on the morning of the 26th, many school districts made last minute decisions to either close or have delayed openings. Many closed early that afternoon. Even Saint Joseph's University and West Chester University closed. Conditions though became worse when the second punch of heavier snow came through on the evening of the 26th.
