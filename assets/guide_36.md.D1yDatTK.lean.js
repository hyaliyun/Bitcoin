Later the association was renamed the Canadian Suffrage Association. Background Dr. Emily Howard Stowe (1831-1903) was the first Canadian woman to practice medicine in Canada. She was not allowed to study medicine in Canada, but in 1867 obtained a degree in homeopathic medicine from the New York Medical College for Women and that year opened her homeopathy practice in Toronto. It was not until 1880 that she was granted a licence to practice medicine. In 1877 Stowe was one of the founders of the Toronto Women's Literary Guild, which managed to obtain access to some higher education for women. The Guild was renamed the Canadian Women's Suffrage Association in 1883. Foundation In 1888 Stowe attended an international suffragette conference in Washington, D.C., United States. Fired with determination to bring new life to the movement, she founded the Dominion Women's Enfranchisement Association (DWEA) in 1889. The DWEA was among a number of Women's organizations founded around this time and run by exceptionally capable women, others being the Women's Art Association of Canada, National Council of Women of Canada, Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire (IODE), the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), Girls' Friendly Society of Canada, Women's Institutes and Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). History Stowe was the first president of the DWEA. She held office from 1889 until her death in 1903. Within a year of its foundation branches began to appear in different towns of Ontario. On 12‚Äì13 June 1890 the DWEA held a convention in Toronto attended by more than 100 women. Speakers included Dr. Emily Stowe and the Reverend Anna Howard Shaw, M.D. of the United States. Kathleen Blake Coleman of the Mail invited comment from her readers. She quoted one from \\"Pollie\\" at length, In 1890 the DWEA sponsored a suffrage bill, but without success. At this stage the suffragettes were simply claiming the right to vote since they paid taxes and could bring new ideas to politics. Otherwise, they were not asking for full equality of the sexes. Most believed that the woman's place was in the home, but did not think this was incompatible with voting. In 1893 the DWEA was one of the first national organizations to federate with the National Council of Women of Canada. Emily Stowe and Emily Willoughby Cummings of the Anglican Women's Auxiliary were two of the organizers of the founding meeting of the National Council, held in the Horticultural Pavilion in Toronto on 27 October 1893. About 1,500 women attended, and some men. Stowe and her daughter Augusta Stowe-Gullen (1857-1943), the first woman to graduate from a Canadian medical school, organized a much publicized \\"mock parliament\\". The debate was staged in 1896. The women participants debated whether men should be given the vote. Using the same arguments that men had used against votes for women, they voted against the proposal. Despite their efforts, the DWEA was not successful in advancing the cause of women's suffrage in Canada at either the Federal or Provincial levels. No bills were introduced between 1893 and 1910 for women's votes, and the conservative National Council of Women of Canada would not give support until 1910. The Canadian Suffrage Association was founded in 1906. Augusta Stowe-Gullen became president of this successor organization. She later became vice-president of the National Council of Women.

The Netherlands' main highway net (hoofdwegennet), comparable to Britains net of trunk roads, consists of most of its 5,200 km of national roads, supplemented with the most prominent provincial roads. Although only about 2,500 km of roads are fully constructed to motorway standards, much of the remainder are also expressways for fast motor vehicles only. Except for motorways and expressways, most roads support cyclists. Some 35,000 km (a quarter of all Dutch roads) feature dedicated cycle tracks, physically segregated from motor traffic. A further 4,700 km of roads have clearly marked bike lanes, and on other roads, traffic is calmed such that cyclists and motorists can safely mix. Busy junctions sometimes give priority to cyclists, and in street roads like fietsstraten and woonerven, bicycles always have priority over cars. Since 1997, a national traffic safety program called Duurzaam Veilig (Sustainable Safety) has had a major impact on the road network. Traffic calming has been applied on a massive scale. In 2009, more than 33,000 km of extra-urban roads had a speed limit of no more than 60 km/h, and over 41,000 km of local roads were limited to 30 km/h, adding up to more than half of the entire road network. A popular calming measure is to replace intersections by roundabouts, of which there were almost 5,000 in 2015, both in and out of town. Mobility on Dutch roads has grown continuously since the 1950s and now exceeds 200 billion km travelled per year, three quarters of which are done by car, meaning that while Dutch roads are numerous, they are also used with one of the highest intensities of any road network. History The 1927 Rijkswegenplan was the first Dutch national highway structure plan in a century. The country's first centrally-planned highway system dates back to the early 19th century, when Napoleon was emperor of France, and the Kingdom of Holland was annexed into the French empire. In 1811, Napoleon decreed that a network of 229 paved imperial roads (Routes Imp√©riales) would be created, extending from Paris to the borders of his empire.Liste des routes imp√©riales fran√ßaises de 1811 - Wikip√©diaRoute imp√©riale - Wikipedia (NL) In addition to systematic paving, the roads were all numbered, an innovation at the time. Construction of several imperial highways through Holland commenced. Amsterdam was connected to Paris by Route Imp√©riale no. 2, a section between Amsterdam and Utrecht is today still a part of the A2 motorway. After the country's liberation in 1813, Hollands new king continued the project but with Amsterdam at the centre. The plan was expanded several times. In 1821, it projected 42 Rijksstraatwegen (literally: \\"Imperial paved roads\\"), which were built until 1850. Since 1927, this network was transformed into today's system of Rijkswegen (national highways) in the Netherlands. The first motorway dates back to 1936, when the current A12 was opened to traffic between Voorburg and Zoetermeer, near The Hague. Motorway construction accelerated in the 1960s and 1970s but halted in the 1980s. Current motorway expansion mostly occurs outside the Randstad. General maximum speed limits were introduced in 1957 (50 km/h within built-up areas), and in 1973 (100 km/h on extra-urban highways); the motorway limit was raised to 120 km/h in 1988. Roads by management Roads are developed and maintained by authorities at all four administrative levels in the Netherlands. About 5,200 km of national roads (Rijkswegen) are controlled by central government agency Rijkswaterstaat, and the country's twelve provinces control about 7,800 km of provincial roads. Most motorways are national roads, and the remaining national roads are mostly expressways. Only a few motorways are provincial ones, and they are much shorter and serve mostly regional traffic.Provinciale weg - Wikipedia (NL) Frequently, they used to be national roads. Road numbers counting one or two digits (regardless of the preceding letter) are mostly national roads, but those with three numbers are typically provincial roads. Municipality roads make up the bulk of the network, totalling some 120,000 km. They are mostly local roads. Aside from the division in provinces, the Netherlands is also divided in 22 water management boards. Together with miscellaneous authorities, they own and control another 7,500 km of roads. For some roads, it is because they are a physical element of water barriers, like dikes and dams while others provide primary access to critical water control structures and may not even be open to the public. Roads by safety policy category Single carriageway expressway economically upgraded to meet most of the new regional flow road standard. A physical traffic barrier, and a hard shoulder were added. Dutch roads are typically built for cyclists as well (cycle track in red). In 1997, the collective Dutch road management authorities reached agreement on a major traffic safety program, called Duurzaam Veilig (\\"Sustainable Safety\\"). One of its principles is a clear-cut categorisation of roads, into a small number of visually distinct and clearly recognisable designs, that must be applied consistently throughout the country. Three main categories were established: * Stroomwegen (literally \\"Flow roads\\" or \\"Through roads\\"), aimed at a consistent flow of large amounts of motorised traffic, over long(er) distances, and with generally high speeds. In the design of these roads, traffic flow is consistently paramount, meaning: physical separation of traffic in opposite directions (ideally multiple carriageways), controlled highway access and grade separated junctions without traffic lights. Motorways and expressways fall into this category. General maximum speeds are 130 km/h for motorways, and 100 km/h for regional flow roads. In the long term, the new road type \\"regional flow road\\" will reshape the existing collection of non-motorway expressways (Autowegen) in the Netherlands. * Gebiedsontsluitingswegen (\\"Distributor roads\\") prioritise traffic flow on road sections but traffic exchange at intersections. Fast and slow road users are separated, for instance cycle tracks are segregated from the main carriageway. Intersections are at grade, aimed at the most effective traffic exchange in terms of changing direction, road type or speed. Junctions are in the form of roundabouts where possible, or otherwise have traffic lights. For motor traffic, the speed limits are 80 km/h in the country and 50 or 70 km/h in the built-up area. Arterial roads fall in this category. * Erftoegangswegen (\\"Access roads\\") connect individual properties to the rest of the road system. Traffic exchange takes place not only at intersections but also in between. Road users are pulling in and out of lots, and traffic modes mix. The street design must facilitate ingress and egress from vehicles as well as loading and unloading. A living function as well as a traffic function is intended. Speeds are therefore kept low: 60 km/h on rural or regional access roads, and 30 km/h on access roads in the built-up area, except for woonerfs (woonerven), where only 15 km/h is allowed. Out of town, there should ideally be separate cycle tracks or at least clearly painted bike lanes. In town, there can be cycle lanes, but on smaller 30 km/h roads, cyclists can typically mix with cars without problems. Among others, frontage roads and fietsstraten (bike streets) are considered to be access roads. Roads by type =Outside of built-up areas= Autosnelweg The Ridderkerk interchange Autosnelweg, or simply snelweg, is the Dutch designation for motorways or freeways. They are controlled-access highways for fast motor vehicles only and are consistently built with multiple carriageways, guard rails and interchanges with overpasses. Since September 2012, the nationwide maximum speed has been raised to 130 km/h, but on many stretches, speed is still limited to 120 km/h or 100 km/h. Dutch motorways may only be used by motor vehicles both capable and legally allowed to go at least 60 km/h. To improve traffic flow, a common feature of Dutch motorways is peak, rush hour or plus lanes, that allow motorists to use the hard shoulder in case of congestion. Less common but increasingly so, multiple carriageways are applied to separate local and regional traffic from through traffic. By splitting traffic in the same direction into parallel carriageways, the number of weaving motions across lanes is reduced, and the traffic capacity per lane of the road is optimised. Autosnelwegen are consistently numbered and signposted with an A and up to three digits, like A12. Motorways are by definition stroomwegen (\\"flow roads\\") and most of them are national roads: only a few shorter stretches are under provincial control. Autoweg All Dutch motorways (in red) and N-roads (green). Some N-roads are Autowegen (expressways). Autoweg is the legal designation for expressways that do not (fully) meet motorway standards. Although they are by definition limited-access highways for faster motor vehicles only, they were built to significantly varying standards. Designs range from dual carriageways, with shoulders and grade separation, and center dividers, to single carriageways with just one lane per direction, no traffic barrier, and only intermittent shoulder patches called Vluchthavens. Many intersections are at grade with traffic lights, or they are roundabouts. There can also be moveable bridges in these roads. In either of the latter cases, the speed limit is frequently reduced to 70 km/h before one reaches the junction or the bridge. The standard speed limit is 100 km/h, unless marked otherwise. Only motor vehicles both capable and legally allowed to go at least 50 km/h are allowed on an Autoweg. Although Autowegen do not have to conform completely to the new Dutch design standard for regional flow roads (stroomwegen), many of these roads require at least some upgrades. Otherwise, they are downgraded to the safety category of distributor roads and so lose their expressway status. Autowegen are always numbered and mostly signposted with an N (for Non motorway highway) and up to three digits, like N34. Almost all of these expressways are national or provincial roads. Other Non motorway highways that are not expressways either are simpler in design, with level intersections and mostly single carriageways. Nevertheless, many of them feature adjacent bicycle tracks. Regional access road with colored advisory bike lanes ‚Äî no center line marking. As far as these roads have (inter)regional significance, they are also numbered and to an extent signposted with an N and typically three digits. In that case, the roads are referred to as N-roads. These roads are mostly categorised as distributor roads, with a speed limit of 80 km/h. In principle, farm traffic and slow road users are allowed, but in many cases there are parallel roads like frontage roads or cycle tracks. In partially built-up rural areas, the speed limit may drop to 60 km/h, as indicated by signage. Provincial road N377 is an example of an N-road that is only partially an Autoweg. Primary N-roads are numbered up to N400, and the numbers have to be on road signs. Although these roads can fall under any of the road management authorities, most are provincial roads. N-roads of secondary importance are numbered 401 through 999, but the numbers are not frequently signposted. They serve a more local function. Over time, they are transferred from provinces to municipalities, and the numbers are dropped. From 1998 to 2007, more than 33,000 km of roads have been converted to regional access roads with a speed limit of 60 km/h, so indicated by signage, and frequently in zones. Regional access roads are visually distinct from other roads having no center line marking. Slower vehicles and non- motorised traffic are allowed. Busier roads have adjacent cycle tracks, but quieter ones have advisory bike lanes. Again, they can fall under any of the road management authorities. On extra-urban roundabouts, motor vehicles virtually always have priority over cycle tracks in the Netherlands. =Within built-up areas= Inside of built-up areas, all roads are municipal. They are categorised only as either distributor roads or local access roads. Arterial roads and collector roads fall into the first category. Their maximum speed is 50 km/h except for arterials with a dual carriageway, which may be 70 km/h. Bicycle tracks have to be segregated. Particular types of arterials are stadsroutes and city ring roads. Dutch city route number sign A traffic-calmed street with wide advisory cycle lanes (red) that motorists may use to pass oncoming cars. Drivers must use them safely though and not crowd out the cyclists. Stadsroutes (city routes) form a network of numbered arterials that connect parts of a city to a ring road or motorways running outside the city. City routes are signposted prefixed by an s and numbered from 100 or 101. When there is an s 100 present, it is an inner city ring road around the city centre. Stadsroutes can so far be found in seven Dutch cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Almere, Zaanstad, Heerlen and Nijmegen. Nijmegen has only its s 100 centre ring operational, but other routes are in progress. Heerlen also has only its s 100 ring right now, but it is shared with the nearby cities of Landgraaf and Kerkrade. Dutch city ring sign Contrary the way motorways and N-roads are numbered, city routes are not a national system. The same numbers can be used in every partaking city and are therefore not unique. Many other Dutch cities have constructed inner city ring arterials without numbering them (yet). From 1998 through 2007, more than 41,000 km of city streets have been converted to local access roads with a speed limit of 30 km/h, for the purpose of traffic calming. Local access streets include frontage roads, fietsstraten and woonerven although the legal status of the latter two is somewhat ambiguous. Woonerf cyclestreet (fietsstraat) sign (unofficial) A fietsstraat (cyclestreet) where bicycles are the main form of transport and cars are considered \\"guests\\". Woonerf (literally \\"living yard\\") or legally just Erf, is the Dutch term for a specific implementation of living streets, abundantly applied throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Although not officially a part of the Sustainable Safety road categorisation policy, the woonerf is still a legally defined Dutch road type. The defining characteristic is that the living function of the street (walking, talking, playing) has official priority over its traffic function. Legally, pedestrians and children have priority over all other road users. They may use the full width of the street to walk and play. Road paving is more or less continuous. Under article 45 of the Dutch traffic code, motorised traffic in a woonerf is restricted to \\"walking pace\\", which the Dutch Supreme Court has ruled to be 15 km/h. Parking is also restricted. Although woonerven have come under pressure from the drive to implement zones of 30 km/h local access streets, they are still prolific. In some places, new ones are still created, such as for space restrictions. In 2011, 20% of all Dutch homes were still located in woonerf areas, and around 2 million people were living in woonerven. Fietsstraat (literally \\"cyclestreet\\") is not (yet) an official Dutch road type or category. The implementation comes down to paving the full width of the road (except for the sidewalk) as a cycle track, including the associated color. Signs are put up by the municipal authorities, informing motorists that they are guests and must yield to cyclists. Correspondingly, the road portion of the street (between kerbs) is then legally considered to be a bicycle track with benefits instead of a road in the conventional sense. Notable roads and statistics As a side effect of the very dense road network, roadside / verge grass strips account for a full 3 percent of the Netherlands' total land area. =Most major motorways= A15 / A16 near Rotterdam The busiest Dutch motorway is the A13 between The Hague and Rotterdam, with a traffic volume of 140,000 motor vehicles per day. The province of Utrecht in the centre of the country however, has the busiest motorways on average (almost 100,000 vehicles a day), with major motorways A1, A2, A12, A27 and A28 running through it. The busiest four-lane motorway in the Netherlands is the A10 in the Coen Tunnel, in Amsterdam, with 110.000 vehicles per day. The widest Dutch motorway is the A15/A16, just south of Rotterdam, with 16 lanes, in a 4+4+4+4 setup. As to the method: the number of passing motorised vehicles is counted every minute of the day at some 20,000 measuring stations on the Dutch motorway network. =Carpool / H.O.V. and reversible lanes= Dual lane reversible carriageway on the A1 motorway, shown to the left of the center barrier. On 27 October 1993, the first \\"High-occupancy vehicle lane\\", (HOV-) or \\"Carpool\\" lane in Europe, was opened in the Netherlands, on the A1 motorway, which was simultaneously arranged as a reversible lane. It originally consisted of only one lane, available for either direction, for vehicles carrying at least three occupants. On the very day of its official opening, former Dutch Minister of Transport and Water Management Tjerk Westerterp drove his car over the lane by himself, to provoke a trial case, to test the legality of such a road lane. After initial conviction in a civil court, the appeals court ruling determined, that the term \\"carpooling\\" at the time had no official meaning in Dutch law, nor the Dutch traffic code, and consequently, that the newly installed \\"carpooling\\" signage on this expressway lane entirely lacked all legal basis. Much to the disappointment of Westerterp, the court did not address the legal equality principle, which he presented as a fundamental issue in the case, to road users. In 1994, the reversible lane was opened to all traffic, regardless of occupancy. The most significant case of reversible lanes in Holland is currently formed by one roadway tube of the second Coen Tunnel. Opened in 2013, the tunnel was built right next to the first Coen Tunnel of 1966, to greatly improve its capacity and alleviate severe daily congestion at the tunnel. One of the 2nd tunnel's two tubes, containing two lanes, is part of a 2-lane, 5 kilometre reversible road section. The original section on the A1 motorway is currently under reconstruction, and will become an 8 kilometre (5 mile), mostly 2-lane reversible stretch, as part of a renovation involving motorways A1, A6 and A9, and is to be reopened in 2020.

He was a professor of Mass Communication and Journalism at the University of Rome La Sapienza and the University of Languages and Communication IULM in Milan and author of several works. He made his debut at the age of eighteen as a copywriter in the family advertising business, Octa Marketing and Communication (ASSAP - Assocomunicazione), in which he himself gave life to an audiovisual sector. After his first experiences in private radio stations, he began his career in journalism, first with newspapers and, beginning in 1979, in Rai, where he led programs and participated in innovative projects, such as Radiosoftware in 1982, the first experiment of radio broadcasting using computers and established an interactive circuit with listeners. From 1987 forward, he has developed wide international experience in the Brazilian Telemontecarlo (Rede Globo), as home and foreign correspondent, war reporter and anchorman. He returned to work for RAI in 1993 as anchorman and key foreign correspondent. He taught Mass Communication from 1989 in Italy and abroad in a number of prestigious universities and international organizations, such as EJTA (European Journalism Training Association). His book The Language of the News - the tools and rules of journalism, published by Rizzoli, is now in its second edition . He has cultivated a passion for the arts, particularly in the fields of music and television, since his youth as both writer and event organizer. In the seventies, Petrone was an exponent of the so-called Vesu- wave, a Neapolitan cultural and musical current that was named after the Vesuvius Volcano as an eruption of art and creativity, celebrated by artists such as Andy Warhol. Following legal studies, he continued his studies specializing in Mass Communication and Interpersonal Communication. As War Correspondent, in 1991 he was the first Italian to broadcast live from liberated Kuwait, where he went in following the U.S Marines. Subsequently, he covered the wars in former Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Libya. He was a frontline reporter during the War on terrorism, starting from the September 11 attacks in the U.S. and the March 11 attacks in Madrid. He reported on the political and nuclear crisis in Iran as well as the so-called Arab Spring, in Tunisia and Egypt. He was also the first Italian journalist to cover major events employing his own camera during the Gulf War, the collapse of the USSR and the war in Yugoslavia. He worked in foreign correspondence offices in New York, London, Paris and Moscow. He followed all the U.S. presidential elections since 1992, taking long-term residence in the United States for complete coverage. As a documentary filmmaker, he won the Federchimica Award in 1988 with an investigation into high-risk factories. In 1994, his behind- the-scenes in-depth report on prostitution revealed a radical transformation of the sex market in Italy. In addition, he has created documentaries reporting on Iraq, Iran, the U.S. Welfare Reform, the British Royal Family and on Italian musicians emigrated to the United States. In 1993, with the seven-episode program Antennopolis, he gave a candid picture of the state of Italian television, and in particular the political bias on information, in the midst of the Tangentopoli scandal. He has always been an adamant critic of the system of awarding public contracts and has fought for the freedom of the press and impartiality in information and for journalism as an instrument for the democratic control of institutions. \\"Those who provide information are at the service of citizens. This information is needed for people to live, to have a fair representation of the world in which they interact. Playing tricks with the cards means playing tricks on people's lives. It is equivalent to murder. Physical, not only ideological\\" (Petrone, The Language of the News). He was a university professor and has taught in a number of schools of journalism in Italy and abroad. Beyond his teaching at the University of Rome La Sapienza and the University IULM in Milan, he has taught journalism and communication for institutions such as the Italian National Order of Journalists, the European Journalism Training Association (EJTA), the Italian Switzerland course of Journalism, the School of Journalism in Perugia and Bologna, the faculty of Communication of the University of Macerata, the Rai School for Journalism and the Media Institute of Tirana. After leaving his youth as a singer-songwriter in Naples and the company of friends Edoardo Bennato, Enzo Gragnaniello, Pino Daniele and Jenny Sorrenti to dedicate himself to journalism, he continued to write songs, often inspired by current events or situations he encountered in the countries he visited. In more recent years, he has collaborated with several young musicians. He writes on Myspace: \\"I like to tell the stories of the men and the events that serve to denounce abuse that threatens democracy. For this reason, I was a singer of the Neapolitan Power movement when I could not be a journalist yet. As a journalist, I continued to compose, especially when reporting from abroad; I wrote words driven by emotions that could not find a place in television journalism. They are songs that others can sing. Music also serves the purpose of keeping people alive. Music is life. And words in music are a common thread in our existence\\". Petrone died in Rome on 15 May 2020, at the age of 65. He was battling with an illness since 2017.√à morto il giornalista Sandro Petrone, aveva 66 anni  Music  In all his years of \\"musical silence\\", Petrone continued his collaboration with the Neapolitan percussionist Tony Cercola. After the attacks in the United States of September 11, 2001, the Second Gulf War, the massacre of Nasiriyah, the earthquake of San Giuliano, and the events of 11 March in Madrid, it was Cercola who encouraged Petrone to resume his activity as a songwriter to allow expression for the strong emotions which had been \\"kept in check by the daily recounting in journalism of such events\\". After winning the first City of Santa Marinella Award in 2003 with the collection of songs Blues for the Blues (original Italian title Blues in Blu), he began to devote more of his time to music, developing links with the avant- garde musical scene and promoting the experimentation of young Italian musicians. On an August night in 2007, in the gardens of Piazza Giovenale in Rome, I come home blues, the first song of a new cycle, took shape and was dedicated to the world as seen through the eyes of the correspondent. At that time, a new musical project was born out of Petrone's meeting with the musician Martino De Cesare from Apulia. Between 2007 and 2008, they recorded a limited edition album entitled Alex is back (after a long time) for the virtual recording label Inconscio Label. The work was recorded during a tour of ten venues in Italy and abroad, in improvised recording studios in private homes, thanks to new technologies and with the participation of artists over the Internet.

He served as Interim Governor of East Florida in 1789. Biography Francisco Cruzat was the son of Balthazar and Francesca Cruzat. He joined the Spanish Army in his youth and came to Louisiana (New Spain) with Lieutenant Gen Alejandro O'Reilly in 1769 as a captain of grenadiers. Cruzat arrived at St. Louis on May 20, 1775.

In 1778, Cruzat was removed from office on the orders of Louisiana Governor Bernardo Galvez, and was replaced by Fernando de Leyba. In 1779, Cruzat took part in the conquest of Baton Rouge, and in early 1780 he gained the rank of lieutenant colonel. In September 1780, Francisco Cruzat was reappointed lieutenant governor of Upper Louisiana after the death of Fernando de Leyba in June earlier that year. Only a few months later in January 1781, Cruzat dispatched an attack on Fort St. Joseph near Lake Michigan in response to rumors of a spring attack on St. Louis by the British. His force was commanded by Captain Eugenio Pourr√© and included about 140 Spanish soldiers and 60 Native American volunteers. The militia also included Ensign Charles Tayon and the interpreter Louis Chevalier. Cruzat and his forces successfully captured Fort St. Joseph on February 12, 1781. On November 27, 1787, Cruzat left his office of lieutenant governor of St. Louis and was succeeded by Manuel P√©rez. In 1789 he served as Interim Governor of East Florida, temporarily replacing an unwell Arturo O¬¥Neill who had requested a leave of absence. O'Neill organized the Third Battalion of Pensacola in 1790, which Cruzat was assigned to command, and Cruzat continued that assignment until he died.  Personal life  Cruzat married Nicanora (also referred to as \\"Anicanora\\") Ramos, a native of Cartegena, Spain. They had four children together, Antonio, Francois, Josefa and Jos√©. There is little mention of Francois, and in Cruzat's first term as lieutenant governor of Upper Louisiana, his daughter Josefa died while still a young child and was buried in the church cemetery. Their two surviving sons were Antonio and Jos√©. In May 1782, his wife and their two sons were captured by British allies near present-day Memphis, Tennessee while they were en route to St. Louis. Cruzat was able to negotiate their release for a ransom of 4500 pesos. His wife died in St. Louis in 1786, and Cruzat died in Pensacola, Florida in 1790.

Its urban core is modelled after the small town of Hallstatt inAustria,rated as World Heritage. The centere of the area contains a replica of the parish church, the fountain and various other objects from the original Hallstatt town centre. The housing project was built by the China Minmetals ltd., a wholly-owned Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of China's largest steel and mining company, China Minmetals Corp., (CMC). The name officially used by the operator is \\"Hallstatt See - Huizhuo\\". Tourism  Hallstatt See - Huzhuo is considered to be one of the excellent tourist attractions in southern China. It is rated with 4 stars (national highest ranking is 5 stars).  Transport links  Hallstatt See is located in the economic region of the Pearl River Delta, in the prefecture of Huizhuo and here directly in front of the city of Huizhuo. Due to the direct affiliation to the city of Huizhuo and its infrastructure network, it can also be reached consciously from the nearby southern Chinese economic metropolises such as Guangzhuo, Shenzhen or Hong Kong. Huizhuo has an airport, highways and high- speed trains. 6 pairs of high speed trains have been in service for passengers travelling from Hong Kong to Huizhou or from Huizhou to Hong Kong. It takes around 70 - 80 minutes to finish the distance of 96 kilometers( 59 miles) between Hong Kong West Kowloon Station and Huizhou South Station. It takes 30-70 minutes for the nearly 70 Shenzhen to Huizhou high speed trains to finish a distance of 56 km (35 mi). Most of these bullet trains start from Shenzhen North Railway Station, and only 4 start from Futian Railway Station. In the other side, most of them arrive at Huizhou South Railway Station, and a few arrive at Huidong Railway Station. About 20 normal trains are also operated on this route. It takes them 1.5-2 hours to finish the journey.  Reception in Austria  The original Hallstatt's mayor Alexander Scheutz first heard about the plans to build a replica of his town in 2011. At that point the construction was already in an advanced state. While parts of the Hallstatt population viewed the Chinese plans with scepticism, mayor Alexander Scheutz said that he saw a chance in the project for the tourism in the \\"original\\" Hallstatt. He personally visited the opening ceremony in 2012 and signed an agreement for cultural exchange.  Similar projects in China  The construction of Hallstatt is part of a trend in China to mimic or rebuild other parts of the world. While this is one of only a few examples where a whole town layout has been partly replicated (the second being Venice), there are many similar places in China. Other examples include a copy of the Eiffel tower in Tianducheng and several copies of European castles in Chongqing. For other portions of whole cities replicated in China, there is a Manhattan in Tianjin (Yujiapu Financial District) and a copy of Jackson Hole, Wyoming in Hebei Province (Jackson Hole, China). There is also a replica Venice in Dalian, Liaoning Province, which freezes over in winter. Many of these copycat cities are housing developments for the wealthier Chinese population.

John Ugelstad, who invented them in 1977 and patented the method in 1978,Rangnes 1997:4‚Äì5 are uniform polymer particles, typically 0.5 to 500 micrometres in diameter. Bio-reactive molecules can be absorbed or coupled to their surface, and used to separate biological materials such as cells, proteins, or nucleic acids. Microbeads have been used for isolation and handling of specific material or molecules, as well as for analyzing sensitive molecules, or those that are in low abundance, e.g. in miniaturized and automated settings.  Background  Microbeads were created when John Ugelstad managed to form polystyrene beads of the same spherical sizes at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)In 1977: The Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH). In 1996: NTH was merged into the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). in 1977. A few years later (See graphic illustration) he created superparamagnetic microbeads (Dynabeads), which exhibit magnetic properties when placed in a magnetic field. When they are removed from the magnetic field, there is no residual magnetism, which led to the development of magnetic separation technology. Other processes such as centrifugation, filtration, columns or precipitation, are not needed. Microbeads display a large surface area per volume. This together with uniformity of size and shape provides for very good accessibility and fast liquid-phase reaction kinetics, and rapid and efficient binding. NTNU/Mads Nortvedt) Use Black polyethylene microspheres can have magnetic or conductive functionality, and have uses in electronic devices, EMI shielding and microscopy techniques. Fluorescent polyethylene microspheres are commonly used to run blind tests on laboratory and industrial processes, in order to develop proper methods and minimize cross-contamination of equipment and materials. Microspheres that appear to be invisible in the daylight can be illuminated to display a bright fluorescent response under UV light. Colored polyethylene microspheres are used for fluid flow visualization to enable observation and characterization of flow of particles in a device or be used as visible markers in microscopy and biotechnology.  Applications  Microbeads serve as the main tool for bio-magnetic separations. A range of patented processes and applications have been developed based on the use of microbeads in academic and industrial research. Microbeads are pre-coupled with a ligand; a biomolecule such as antibody, streptavidin, protein, antigen, DNA/RNA or other molecule. There are three steps involved in the magnetic separation process: # Bind ‚Äì Microbeads bind to the desired target, relative to the specific affinity of the ligand on the surface of the beads. # Wash ‚Äì Microbeads will move to the side of the tube in response to a magnetic field, along with the bound material. This happens quickly and efficiently because of the magnetic field and the micro- sized particles. The un-bound and un-wanted material that is left behind in the sample is removed by pipetting/aspiration. The bead-bound material is washed using the appropriate buffers, by applying the magnet. # Elute ‚Äì Once the bead-bound target is isolated and washed, it can be released in the appropriate solution and desired volume. It can then be used for any downstream application directly, or the microbeads can be released and removed. Microbeads are used for cell isolation and cell expansion. Proteins and protein complexes can be separated, e.g. in immunoprecipitation protocols. Molecular studies and diagnostics also benefit from microbeads (e.g. immunoassay IVD and nucleic acid IVD). When microbeads are coupled with streptavidin, they offer a very efficient way to isolate any biotinylated molecule. This is frequently used in DNA/RNA binding protein studies, sequencing, and to prepare single stranded templates. Gene expression analysis also benefits from microbeads, such as isolating mRNA for transcriptional analysis. There are many uses for microbeads, mostly for biotechnology and biomedical research. Microbeads and magnetic separation technology have enabled a range of innovative methods to benefit research on disease prevention, medicine, and other fields to improve the human condition.

As pictures of life in an ancient New England town, they are unsurpassed for humor, clever character drawing, and delicacy of touch. She died at her home in Boston, Massachusetts, in March, 1886. After her death, Arlo prepared for the press her sketches, \\"Old Salem\\" (1886), and a novel, A Woodland Wooing (1889). In her memory, he wrote \\"Sonnets in Shadow\\", which was dedicated to her. Her son was the archaeologist, Oric Bates (1883‚Äì1919). Selected works * Bob's Breaking in, 1880 * Prince Vance: The Story of a Prince with a Court in His Box, 1888 (with A.

Plot The film follows angry mortgage temp Marty as he cooks up small scams against the hated corporate world he's stuck in. Frustrated by the boring nature of his work and the low pay, Marty uses his low level crime as an outlet to rebel. Among his regular scams are going to banks and repeatedly opening new checking accounts to get free deposits, as well as taking items from his job and taking them to a local office supplies store for fraudulent refunds. One day on the job at First National Bank, Marty swipes a stack of refund checks from the company, then forges the payees' signatures to sign several of the checks over to himself. Later Marty's boss, Carol, tells him that the company receives images of the checks when they are cashed and can see who is cashing them. Fearing his scheme will be discovered, Marty goes into hiding at his co-worker Derek's basement. While in hiding, Marty wastes his days playing video games, goofing off with Derek and sucking down Mountain Dew and frozen pizzas. He also starts crafting a weapon made out of steak knives and a Nintendo Power Glove inspired by Freddy Krueger's bladed glove from the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. Derek tells Carol that Marty is sick and can't come into work, but bungles the lie and Marty soon begins to think Carol is close to discovering what happened to the checks. Marty starts to run low on cash, and on a trip to the convenience store at Derek's behest the cashier cheats him out of five dollars, with security cameras capturing Marty trashing a store display in response. Fearing someone will discover him based on the tape, Marty hops a bus to Detroit, bringing along his modified Nintendo Power Glove. He uses up most of his remaining money when he stays at a hotel and orders room service. In the bathroom, Marty tends to a cut he got on his hand at work before running away and discovers that the cut has become badly infected. Needing somewhere else to stay, Marty goes to a cheap motel for a night and illegally copies his room key. After checking out he breaks into the hotel to sleep, only to be discovered in the morning by a maid. The hotel manager confronts him and tries to call the police, but Marty threatens him with the glove and runs off. Marty tries to cash his remaining stolen checks at an ATM, but discovers that his account has been shut down. He then goes to a payday loan provider to attempt to cash the checks, but the owner finds the transaction suspicious and accuses Marty of fraud. The owner, having caught Marty on security camera and identified him using his drivers license, calls the police and tries to keep Marty in a back room. Marty slashes the owner in the face and neck with the glove to once again escape, and leaves the owner lying on the floor bleeding profusely. Marty speaks on the phone with Derek and discovers that Carol has been fired. Believing this means the company won't discover his check scheme, Marty starts ecstatically racing down the street. Eventually Marty comes to an electronics store window full of TV screens, in which he sees himself caught on camera. Disturbed by this, Marty runs off, with the center TV still capturing one last image of him as he flees.

McManamon, Chief Scientist (retired), US Air Force Paul F. McManamon (born July 1, 1946) is an American scientist who is best known for his work in optics and photonics, as well as sensors, countermeasures, and directed energy.  Early life and education  McManamon was born in East Cleveland, Ohio. He attended St Ignatius high school, where he has been recognized as a distinguished graduate. He received his BS in physics from John Carroll University. He received his MS and PhD in physics from the Ohio State University. Paul delivering a newspaper while in 3rd grade  Government career  Dr McManamon spent his government career at Wright Patterson AFB. He started in electronic warfare and then moved into optical systems while he worked on his PhD. He moved from the Aeronautical Systems Division to the Air Force labs in 1979. Initially he was in charge of the thermal imaging group of about 14 people in the Avionics lab. In 1995 he became the acting chief scientist for avionics, a position he held for 32 months. In 2001 he became Senior Scientist for Electro-Optical Sensors, and in 2005 he became chief scientist for Sensors, as part of the Air Force Research Laboratory. Dr. McManamon is widely recognized as the Father of the Optical Phased Array technology. Starting from 1987, he developed the technologies required to steer laser beams with no moving parts. He has both guided this effort and made significant individual technical contributions. He led in-house work at the Air Force research Laboratory, AFRL, authoring the IEEE WRG Baker award- winning paper in on this subject. He initiated the Phased Arrays approach to active electro-optical systems for laser sensing and laser weapons, and published the first papers in this area in the late 1990s. The Phased Array approach to active EO systems for laser sensing and laser weapons now dominates the beam control sessions at Directed Energy Professional society (DEPs) meetings. Dr. McManamon emphasized performance based sensing for combined sensor and processing development as chief scientist, AFRL Sensors to define an information goal, and develop the required sensors and processing to achieve that goal. In the early 1990s Paul initiated and guided 2D LADAR Lidar for long range ID. He had the vision to use the designator laser along with a near IR camera to identify objects at longer range at night than can be done with a thermal imager. The 2D LADAR for long range ID that Dr. McManamon initiated, is now being deployed in the US Air Force and Army. It significantly increases the object recognition range for US aircraft. From the late 1980s until 2008 Dr. McManamon led the team at AFRL developing numerous LADAR technologies, including laser vibrometers, and synthetic aperture LADAR. Dr. McManamon was an early advocate of pro-active Infrared countermeasures recommending a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency program called medusa. The concept of pro-active IRCM has become prominent in the Air Force countermeasures community.  Later career  Dr. McManamon recently chaired a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Study on Active EO Sensing. The published study was called ‚ÄúLaser Radar Progress and Opportunities in Active Electro- Optical Sensing\\". Laser radar is becoming a significant sensor, with multiple sensing modalities. Shortly before that Dr. McManamon was co-chair of the harnessing Light 2 National Academy of Sciences committee, which published the study, ‚ÄúOptics and Photonics: Essential Technologies for Our Nation.‚Äù This study recommended a National Photonics Initiative, NPI, because optics and photonics is such a key enabler in the US economy. The White House commissioned a fast track committee to respond to the recommendations of the Optics and Photonics study. The recommended NPI is proceeding with significant vigor, encompassing both congress and the executive branches. As a result of the study recommendations and subsequent photonics community activity, the U.S. Department of Defense has selected photonics as the focus of a new Institute for Manufacturing Innovation (IMI). This institute will be the largest to date of the National Network of Manufacturing Innovation Institutes and will comprise a total of $200 million public and private funding. Dr McManamon was vice chair of the NAS study called ‚ÄúSeeing photons‚Äù, having to do with passive electro-optical sensors. Dr. McManamon is president and CTO of Exciting Technology LLC, and works part-time with the University of Dayton as Technical Director of the Ladar and Optical Communications Institute, LOCI, in the EO department  Uber vs Waymo lawsuit on stealing the self-driving technology  Dr. McManamon served as an expert witness on LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) technology which helps self-driving cars see and navigate in Uber vs Waymo lawsuit.  Honors and awards  Paul McManamon at Photonics Asia 2007 conference. Dr McManamon was president of SPIE, the International society for Optics and photonics, in 2006. He is shown on the right at Photonics Asia in 2007, when he was immediate past president of SPIE. In 1998 he was awarded the IEEE W.R.G. Baker Award for best paper in any IEEE Journal or Publication. This includes over 100 separate refereed journals, containing over 20,000 separate articles.

A separate District Councils Act was also passed in 1840 in Lower Canada by the Special Council which administered the province before the passing of the Act of Union. Previously, local government in Canada East and Canada West was based on judicial bodies appointed by the Lieutenant- Governor, the Courts of Quarter Session, which were presided over by justices of the peace. The Act, proposed by Lord Sydenham, established District Councils which consisted of a warden, clerk and treasurer, who were appointed, and district councillors, who were elected. District councils looked after roads, bridges, schools and real estate in the district, expenses associated with the administration of justice and salaries for district and township officers. Any by-laws passed by a district council were subject to review by the governor. The District Council Act was repealed in Canada East in 1845 and replaced by a new Municipal Act which introduced elected officials at the parish and township levels. Local government institutions in Canada West were reorganized by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1849, also known as the Baldwin Act.

De-limbed timber was placed in the mill. The timber was cut from its somewhat rounded shape to a four-sided piece of lumber, which would be further sawed into lumber of useful sizes. The original pieces that were cut, along with the bark, were called \\"slabs\\" and discarded nearby until a use was found for them. Eventually, the slab piles became the most visible part of the area. Other specialists would construct businesses in the area, such as a blacksmith, a general store, a post office, and a wheelwright. Sometimes a village or town would form around the place and the sobriquet \\"slab city\\" was replaced by a place name. Vermont had nine such slab cities. Massachusetts had at least one. The term persisted in the Western United States to 2017 as a name for an area considered unaesthetic by some observers.

It is said that Kaomi could diagnose a disease by feeling the body of any individual and could thereafter prescribe the appropriate medicine to treat it. He had acquired these skills from Boki and Ka ªo ªo.With Kaomi ªs advice to the King proven to be true, along with his capabilities to entertainingly tell amusing stories, landed him favor with the King. Soon after, Kaomi received the title of ‚Äújoint king, joint ruler‚Äù (moi ku ªi, aupuni ku ªi). In addition, appointed chiefs, warriors, and guards helped to develop an honorable name for Kaomi. With this title also came the responsibility and privilege to grant or deny any chief, citizen, or member of the king ªs household land, clothing, money or anything desired for that matter. With Kaomi, remained the power to give or lend for the government. The love of pleasure from the king continued to grow and evil ways that were eliminated were then reinstated.

It was converted into a local history museum for Holmsland Dunes (Holmsland Klit) in the 1970s and is now part of Ringk√∏bing-Skjern Museum. History The house is named after Abeline Christensen (1870-1957), whose father-in-law, Christen Christensen, together with his wife Kathrine, constructed the buildings between 1854 and 1871. Together with her husband Laurid, she took over the farm in 1890 but in 1904 she became a widow with five children in the age between six and 13. Abeline Christensen took over the position as wreckmaster, which was associated with the property, and continued to run the farm. From the 1920s she supplemented her income from summer guests who were staying on the farm. She also managed the local telephone exchange. Abeline lived on the farm with her son and daughter-in-law until her own death in 1957. On the opposite side of the road stands Haurvig Rescue Station (Haurvig Redningsstation), which was decommissioned in 1932. Abeline purchased the building and used it as a place where the local youth could dance to Gramophone records or accordion music until violations of the alcohol ban became too evident. Architecture Abeline's House is four-winged farmhouse surrounding a cobbled yard. It is built to a vernacular design typical of the area. It is constructed in redbrick and has a thatched roof.

Production The idea for a series about four friends striving to survive was born in 2012 by Jadesola Osiberu, few months after the establishment of Ndani TV. Scripts were sought, but none of the scripts submitted captured the director's vision of what she wanted the series to look like. The mission of Ndani is majorly to tell contemporary African stories, Osiberu eventually decided to pen the script for the first season. Kemi ‚ÄòLala‚Äô Akindoju was sought to help with casting. The word \\"Gidi\\", from the title \\"Gidi Up\\", is culled from the popular term \\"Las Gidi\\" (often shortened as \\"Gidi\\") which can be translated as \\"Real Lagos\\", and is used in referring to the city of Lagos. The series was initially an eight-part web miniseries, with a length of approximately eight minutes per episode and used to be broadcast only online. Due to the positive response from the audience, it was decided to make the second season bigger, thereby converting the series into 30 minutes per episode. The second season was also aired on television, with the first season combined together and aired on television as a 52-minute pilot episode for the season.

History  The tomb is the tomb of Henriette Juliane Caroline von R√ºling (1756-1782), the wife of the Hanoverian state secretary Georg Ernst von R√ºling and daughter of Georg Wilhelm von Willich, Vice President of the Higher Appeals Court. It bears the following inscription:Hanover State Government: Der Gartenfriedhof (see bibliography) But over the years, a birch tree has sprouted in the plinth and, growing ever larger, lifted the heavy tombstone. Thus, despite the command of the grave's inscription, the tomb is now \\"open\\". As a result, the tomb became an attraction in the nineteenth century, one among a number of \\"Open graves\\" appearing in horror stories. The tomb is therefore an early example of a tourist attractionsee for example this photo from ca. 1880 and developed at a deeper level into one of the landmarks of the city of Hanover. The story of the tomb forms the premise for the 1883 novel Das ge√∂ffnete Grab by Otto Warbeck. Around 1900, the Open Grave began to appear regularly on postcards.

Her accomplishments include the pioneering of methods for profiling the \\"translatomes\\" of discrete cell-types of plants and identification of a homeostatic sensor of oxygen deprivation in plants. Education Bailey-Serres received her bachelor of science degree from the University of Utah in 1981 and earned a Ph.D. in 'Mitochondrial genome rearrangements in sorghum' from University of Edinburgh in 1986. She was a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley under Michael Freeling. Career =Research= Bailey-Serres and her researchers are investigating the molecular and physiological processes that enable plants to tolerate or survive stresses such as flooding or drought. In general, her areas of research include: * Gene regulation * Translational control * Abiotic stress signaling/response * Low oxygen sensing * Flooding/submergence * Genomic technologies In 2003, Bailey-Serres joined a team of geneticists including Pamela Ronald of the University of California, Davis and rice breeder David Mackill in the search for the Sub1A gene that allows rice to survive complete submergence under water. The gene is not present in all rice plants, but may be introduced through breeding. As a result of this research, scientists at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) created the flood-tolerant rice variety Swarna-Sub1. More than 10 million farmers are growing the rice in their flood-prone fields. =Other activities= From 2005 to 2011, Bailey- Serres was the director of the National Science Foundation's Integrative Graduate Education and Research Trainee Program (IGERT). The program trained 23 Ph.D. students versed in cell biology, chemistry, computational sciences and engineering, in advanced chemical genomics.

She is affiliated with Aoni Production. Biography Her father was a filmmaker and her mother grew up in a family atmosphere where the movies were nearby. Since childhood, her dream was to become a filmmaker. To this end, she began to write scenarios of the stage by the advice, and proceeded to the road of the stage though the writer of the movie was aiming at the same time. She came to be in charge of directing at her university, sometimes voluntarily standing in as an actor, and became a performing actor. Although she continued to work at a theatrical company, she desired to make a movie someday, and worked as a projector. However, she realized how hard it would be to make a living on that path, and she still wanted to do a job related to her favorite movie, so she aspired to be a voice actor.

The seventeen room brick house was built by slave labor in the early 1800s. Portions of the farm were subdivided into several 3-5 acre lots in the late 1800s, with strict setbacks and provisions to maintain the neighborhood, including banning stores and outbuildings. Keeping the neighborhood character protected is still an issue in present times, with development proposals in 2015. The Linwood Center was opened in 1955 by Jeanne M. Simmons as the Linwood Center for Disturbed Children, with 14 day care students and 10 residents. Children stayed for an average of three years of treatment. In 2012 the center built a $6.5 million expansion to increase autism services to 70 children. The Howard County School System reduced its autism expenses by outsourcing to Linwood with the expansion, contributing $925,000 to complete the project.

It is present on the western edge of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin in the Rocky Mountains and foothills of Alberta and British Columbia. It was named for the Fairholme Range near Exshaw in the Canadian Rockies by H.H. Beach in 1943. The formations of the Fairholme Group include fossils of marine animals such as stromatoporoids, corals, brachiopods, crinoids, and conodonts. Lithology The Fairholme Group was deposited in marine environments and can be subdivided into three gross lithologic units: * The basal carbonate platform sequence of the Flume Formation, or in southern areas the Hollebeke and Borsato Formations, which are composed of limestones and dolomites. * The carbonate buildups (reefal sequences) of the Cairn and Southesk Formations, also composed of limestones and dolomites. * The basin-fill clastic rocks of the Maligne, Perdrix, and Mount Hawk Formations, which consist primarily of mudstones, argillaceous limestones, and calcareous shales. These are laterally equivalent to the reefal units. Distribution and thickness The Fairholme Group is present in the Canadian Rockies from the Kakwa Lakes area of northeastern British Columbia, south through Alberta to the Flathead River region of southeastern British Columbia, as well as in the subsurface beneath the immediately adjacent plains to the east. Where fully developed, the group reaches thicknesses from about 300 to 728 m (980 to 2400 feet). Relationship to other units The Fairholm Group overlies the Beaverhill Lake Group in the southern Alberta plains, and unconformably overlies the Middle Devonian Yahatinda Formation or pre-Devonian formations in the mountains. It is overlain by the Crowfoot Formation in the plains, and the Sassenach, Alexo or, rarely, the Palliser Formation in the mountains. It is equivalent to the Woodbend Group and the lower part of the Winterburn Group of the plains.

The division was created on December 16, 1942 from the second formation of the 119th Rifle Division. It was assigned the honorific title of \\"Guards\\" in recognition of that division's leading role in Operation Uranus, the breakthrough that led to the encirclement of the German/Romanian forces in Stalingrad, and the subsequent elimination of the 3rd Romanian Army. The 54th Guards Division continued a record of distinguished service through the rest of World War II.  History  The 54th Guards was one of the first of many Guards rifle divisions created from the divisions that fought in the Battle of Stalingrad. When formed, its order of battle was as follows: * 160th Guards Rifle Regiment from the 365th Rifle Regiment * 162nd Guards Rifle Regiment from the 421st Rifle Regiment * 163rd Guards Rifle Regiment from the 634th Rifle Regiment * 125th Guards Artillery Regiment from the 349th Artillery Regiment * Guards Sapper Battalion from the 224th Sapper Battalion.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", Soviet Guards Rifle and Airborne Units 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IV, 1995, p. 66 At the time of its formation the division it was serving in the 5th Tank Army of the Don Front. Later in the Stalingrad campaign it was transferred to various armies of the Southwestern Front. In February 1943 it was in the 18th Rifle Corps of the 3rd Guards Army and in the spring was reassigned to the 3rd Guards Rifle Corps, where it remained for the duration. The 54th Guards Division, along this its corps, was soon reassigned to the Southern Front (renamed 4th Ukrainian Front on October 20, 1943) and served there for the next 12 months, mostly as part of the 5th Shock Army. It campaigned through the Donbass, southern Ukraine, and finally across the Dnepr River in October 1943. During that time, the division was credited with the liberation of the town of Makeevka in eastern Ukraine, and was given its name as an honorific. After the advance ground to a halt along the Dniester River in the spring of 1944, the division was withdrawn into the Stavka Reserve, and after rebuilding was reassigned to the 28th Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front. During this rebuilding, the division became one of the first rifle divisions to have its towed anti-tank gun battalion replaced with a battalion of SU-76 self-propelled guns. With its Army, the 54th Guards drove into central Poland in the summer, and in early 1945 moved into Latvia to help mop up the German forces there. Following this, the 28th Army was shifted back across Poland, to join the 1st Ukrainian Front's offensive into Czechoslovakia in early May. The division ended the war near Prague. By this time the division had the following honorifics: Makeevka, Order of Lenin, Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov, Order of Kutuzov). After World War II, the division was relocated to Belarus with the 3rd Guards Rifle Corps at Kobryn. In the spring of 1946 the division and its corps were transferred to the 3rd Army, and disbanded within the next six months.

Regional Geology The Husky formation is a part of a larger, Jurassic aged sedimentary package that spans from Northern Yukon to the Northwest Territories. This package is a regional wedge concentrated in the Richardson Mountains, that sits atop North American Cordillera basement rocks. The wedge demonstrates classic basin-ward thickening. Associated with this thickening is a stratigraphic range from coarser, lower to middle-Jurassic sedimentary units to upper-Jurassic shale, which marks the Husky formation. The Husky formation is one of the two shale units in the Aklavik range, and is characterized by its fossil assemblages. The ‚ÄúHusky shale‚Äù lies immediately above the bivalve rich, heavily bioturbated Aklavik sandstone. The ‚ÄúHusky shale‚Äù is one of the youngest units (second youngest to the Porcupine River formation) in this wedge-succession and marks an unconformity with the Aklavic sandstone units below. Fossils in The Husky Formation The Husky succession preserves fossils dating back to the Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian-Volgian) period including foraminifera, bivalves, ostracods and ammonites. provide environmental proxies related to paleoclimatic reconstructions during the deposition of The Husky Formation. Placement of stratigraphic markers between Upper and Middle Jurassic sections along The Husky Succession have been debated. Biostratigraphic analysis of foraminifers as index fossils and lithostratigraphic analysis of sedimentary layers indicated suitable placement of a GGSP between The Porcupine River Formation and the Aklavik Formation in the upper Oxfordian Jurassic period. Foraminifera are protists classified as a sub-phylum of Domain Eukarya and have been preserved in The Husky Formation. Foraminifera are free-living heterotrophic marine organisms suggesting the Aklavik Range was a marine environment during the Jurassic. Bivalves including clams, scallops and mussels were discovered in The Husky Formation. Bivalves are a sub-category of Class Bivalvia and Phylum Mollusca. Marine, freshwater and terrestrial specimens are common. Characteristics of Mollusca include bilateral symmetry, non-segmented, cephalization, complete digestive tract, triploblastic and a reduced coelom. Distinguishing characteristics of Class Bivalvia include a greatly reduced head, laterally compressed foot and a laterally compressed body and shell forcing the mantle to overhang the body. These defining characteristics represent adaptions for burrowing in a soft substration, which explains the presence of Bivalves in soft sediment along The Husky Formation. Not all modern day bivalves are soft bottom dwellers, as much diversity has occurred within the class due to adaptions necessary for survival suggesting depositional environment has changed in the Northern Yukon since the Jurassic. Ammonites are also a part of Phylum Mollusca as Class Cephalopoda, Order Nautilida. Ammonites have well-developed shells that have been preserved as fossils that provide further evidence of a marine environment during deposition of The Husky Formation. A marine environment was essential for cephaplopods as their characteristics represented adaptations for a swimming, predatory mode of existence. Contraction of the mantle pushes out water from the mantle cavity causing propulsion for swimming. Ostracods are a part of Phylum Arthropoda as Class Crustacea. Ostracods are limited to damp environments due to gas exchange using gills, but primarily inhabit aquatic environments which is further evidence supporting a marine environment during the Jurassic in Northern Yukon.

History 2014 Savage Library Renovation East Columbia Branch Library Fundraising for the first county library was started in 1938 by the Women's Civic Club \\"Friends of the Library\\". On October 11, 1940 the first library opened in a portable building in Ellicott City in a ceremony with a speech by Baltimore Judge Joseph N. Ulman. It moved shortly after to a rented building above a meat store on Main street. At this time James A. Clark, Sr. petitioned the county commissioners to add two cents to the tax rate to fund the library. In 1952 a flood washed out the library, and in 1960 the library moved to Frederick Road and St. Johns Lane. George Morrision funded a new library in 1962 in the corner of the historic family owned Gray Rock slave plantation was donated by Charles E. Miller who was attempting to create a housing subdivision. In 1965, a bookmobile serviced stops at Savage, Glenwood, and Glenelg. In The Savage Branch opens in the historic Carroll Baldwin Hall in 1966. In 1968, the Rouse Company signed an agreement to have the Howard County Library System lease one of its buildings for five years at an expense of $5,511 a year with the Columbia Association property assessments paying for furnishings. On January 4, 1981 the $4 million Central Branch opened in Columbia, becoming a facility with the 2nd highest number of items loaned in the county at the time with a computer system named \\"Gandalf\\". In 1984, the Miller Branch received a $3 million expansion from 7000sqft to 22,000sqft. and the Central Branch deploys two microcomputers available to residents who take a two-hour training lesson. In 1989, $1 million was budgeted to buy land for the $6.3 million 33,600 sqft East Columbia Branch, to be opened in 1991. In 2011, a new 63,000sqft HCLS Miller Branch & Historical Center replaces the adjacent 22,000sqft facility next to it. In 2013, Howard County Library System was named 2013 Library of the Year by Gale and Library Journal. In July 2014, the HCLS Savage Branch & STEM Education Center completed a $6.1 million renovation. The renovation doubled the size of the library, taking it to 24,000 sqft. The branch now focuses on STEM related activities, adding valuable classroom space and added outdoor STEM implemented garden that showcases STEM principles at work.

Maryland Consolidated Library System Any person who lives, works, or pays property taxes in Maryland is entitled to obtain a library card at no charge from any county or Baltimore City. They may either obtain a separate card from each jurisdiction or authorize a library card from a different public library system in Maryland to be used there. Also, Maryland counties adjoining the state line will authorize persons living in cities and counties in the state that borders that Maryland county, to obtain a library card at no charge usable in that county only, as long as that jurisdiction in the other state provides reciprocal free library privileges for the residents of that county in Maryland. For example, Prince George's and Montgomery counties will allow reciprocal library privileges with residents of the District of Columbia and nearby counties and cities in Virginia, however, Baltimore would not offer this privilege. Where a non- resident does not qualify for a free card, they may obtain one from any county by paying a yearly fee of $50 to each county they want one from.

They have provided important wildlife habitat for animals such as grizzly bears and caribou as well as trapping and hunting land for the indigenous people of the Yukon for many centuries. They are the northernmost expression of the North American Cordillera, a chain of mountains stretching from Alaska to southern Mexico. This area has a northern climate characterized by short summers and long winters, with average temperatures from in the winter to in the summer While essentially unpopulated, this area is well known for its rich mineral deposits, including gold, silver and copper. Yukon Wernecke mountains Geological Setting In the Proterozic, this area was located on the west coast of ancient North America. The thick sedimentary deposits composed an eastward tapering, supracrustal wedge. At least three cycles of basin formation and extension at the western edge of Laurentia resulted in 22 kilometers of sediment deposited in the early Proterozoic through to the Paleozoic eras. Extension and crustal thinning associated with basin development during the Paleoproterozoic suggests separation of Laurentia from another continent to the west, thought to be ancient eastern Australia. The rifting of cratons produced intracratonic basins and passive margin. Extensional periods were interrupted by orogenies, uplift, magmatism, and hydrothermal activity, ultimately creating the landscape seen today. Thus, the rocks exposed in the Wernecke mountains reveal the events responsible for the early formation of western North America. Crystalline Basement The Yukon's crystalline basement is overlain by thick sedimentary strata deposited in extensional and/or rift basin environments. These basement rocks are not exposed anywhere in the Yukon, and the thickness of the surpracrustal sediments makes surveying using aeromagnetics, a technique used for inferring basement character in NWT, difficult. Hence, the character of the underlying crystalline basement of the Wernecke range is not well-known. Estimates for the age of the basement rock ranges from Archean to early Proterozoic. These rocks are hypothesized to be a thinned continuation of the granitic Fort Simpson terrane exposed to the East based on aeromagnetic and gravity anomalies combined with drill-hole analyses in NWT. Geologic time scale Wernecke Supergroup The Wernecke Supergroup was deposited in the paleoproterozoic from >1.84 Ga - 1.60 Ga. The thickness of the deposits seen in the Wernecke Mountains suggests crustal thinning and extension in passive margin or intracratonal environment. The Wompay orogen has been suggested as a possible mechanism behind the initial formation of the Wernecke basin. This hypothesis is supported by both the timing of the orogeny, approximately 1.88-1.84 Ga, and Nd values in the Wernecke Supergroup consistent with Nd values in rocks involved in the Wompay orogen and the Canadian Shield. The oldest exposed sedimentary deposit in the Wernecke mountains, known as the Wernecke Supergroup, comprises Fairchild Lake Group, the Quartet Group, and the Gillespie Lake Group. Together, these groups represent two cycles of basin subsidence and consequent infilling at the western edge of Laurentia. The first cycle represents initial basin development followed by the second cycle, signifying deepening of the basin and marine transgression. The Fairchild group, the oldest and most deformed member of the Wernecke Supergroup is characterized by about 4.6 km of upward grading siltstone to shale with carbonates, representing a low sediment input environment and a shallow basin. The bottom of the Fairchild group is not exposed, but is thought to rest on the crystalline basement. These sediments have since been metamorphosed to slate, phyllite, or fine-grained chloritoid- or garnet-porphyroblastic muscovite-chlorite-quartz schist by the Racklan orogeny at 1.6 Ga, as well as magmatism and hydrothermal activity. The Quartet group records a time of increasing sediment input beginning with shales and coarsening upward to siltstone and carbonates. The Gillespie lake group is characterised by wavy and plane bedding and preserved cross laminations, algal mats, stromatolites, pisolites, intraclasts, and mud-cracks, indicating a shallow water depositional environment. Racklan Orogeny The Racklan orogeny occurred at 1.60 Ga, after the complete deposition of the Wernecke supergroup but before the deposition of the Wernecke breccias. The timing of the orogeny is constrained by the emplacement of the Wernecke Breccias, which are not deformed and have been dated to 1.59 Ga. The Racklan Orogeny is characterised by low-grade greenschist metaporhism, foliation, superposed crenulations and kink bands. Two sets of major folds have been identified, with first trending north and verging to the east and the second trending east and verging south With successive compression, folding became overturned followed by crenulation and kink band formation during subsequent deformation. Seismic imagery shows Racklan orogeny to be thin skinned, although a lack of basement exposure means this cannot be confirmed. Pinguicla Group Deposition of the Pinguicla group began at 1.38 Ga after a significant period of weathering. Deposition of these sediments indicates a period of rifting and extension in the area, as supported by the incidence of the Hart River volcanic at the same time period. The period of rifting and crustal extension embodied by the Hart River volcanics was followed by basin sedimentation represented by the Pinguicula group. The Pinguicula group is separated from the Wernecke Supergroup by an angular unconformity, representing an erosional stage after the Racklan orogenic event. Three units compose the Pinguicula Group, deep water shales, mid depth carbonates and intertidal carbonates, suggesting an ocean basin environment. Formation of the Pinguicula basin is thought to be related to Laurentia rifting from another unknown continent. Hematite Creek Group The Hematite Creek Group was deposited in the middle Proterozoic, 1.0 Ga - 1.1 Ga. This group is delineated from the Pinguicla Group by a 300 million year gap in the sediment record and an unconformity type boundary. The Hematite Creek Group is approximately a kilometer thick and is composed mostly of clastic and carbonate sediments. These sediments were deposited in a shallow ocean environment, as evidenced by preserved stromatolites, mud cracks and interference ripples. Sediment supply for the Hematite Creek basin formation has been tentatively attributed to the Grenville orogeny of approximately the same time period through U-Pb dating of zircon grains. Corn Creek Orogeny The second orogenic event in the Wernecke mountain area, the Corn Creek orogeny, occurred during the late Proterozoic, 1.0 Ga, after the deposition of the Hematite Creek group. The Corn Creek orogeny deformed the Pinguicula group and the Hematite Creek group in an east side up compressional episode, resulting in significant uplift, metamorphism, and thrust faults and folds verging south west. The Wernecke supergroup shows basically no deformation attributable to this orogeny and retains the east side down mode of deformation acquired during the Racklan orogen. The sole exception is the reactivation of a normal fault within the Wernecke supergroup. This implies Corn Creek was a thin-skinned style compressional event and deformation involved only the Pinguicula and Hematite Creek groups. The unconformity style boundary seen between Hematite Creek strata and Windermere supergroup allows for measurement of the deformation. While not involved in substantial deformation of the Wernecke sediments, the Corn Creek orogeny may have been involved in the exhumation of the Wernecke Supergroup in some areas.) This theory is sustained by the similar cooling age of the white mica in the Wernecke supergroup and the timing of Corn Creek orogeny, dated using 40Ar‚Äì39Ar methods. Windermere Supergroup Windermere Supergroup was deposited on an angular uniformity over the Hematite Creek Group. Using isotopic ages of volcanic rocks emplaced before sedimentation began as well as correlations with sediments on other continents, the beginning of the Windermere Supergroup can be dated at 780 Ma. The Windermere sedimentary deposits formed in a rift or passive margin environment. In contrast to the sediments deposited before, the Windermere Supergroup shows glacially deposited sediments as well as clastic-carbonate grand cycles. The Windermere strata have been correlated to outcrops along the entire North American west coast. This supergroup is composed of two main subgroups, the Rapitan Group and an upper package sometimes referred to as the Hay Creek group. The Rapitan Group consists of glacial related sediments where as the Hay Creek Group consists of more typical clastic-carbonate grand cycles. Laramide Orogeny The Laramide orogeny occurred Late Cretaceous to Tertiary, through the end of the Cretaceous, much later than the Racklan and Corn Creek orogenies. The Laramide orogeny is associated with the accretion of exotic superterranes on the West Coast of North America, as well as the subduction of the Farallon and Kula plates. The effects of the Laramide orogeny are seen throughout North America in mountain belts stretching from Mexico to Alaska. This action resulted in strong metamorphism, plutonism and crustal thickening in the Yukon, including the Wernecke Mountains. Magmatism in the area during the Cretaceous resulted from easterly-directed subduction of the Farallon plates. This instigated felsic to intermediate arc-trench related magmatic activity spanning the Yukon Territory from 99 to 89 Ma. In central Yukon, these rocks were deformed in a northerly-directed, fold-and-thrust belt in the Jurassic to Cretaceous possibly due to more accretion on the West coasts. This deformation resulted in the development of three major faults in the area, the Dawson, Tombstone and Robert Service faults. The gold bearing Tombstone Plutonic suite of intrusions were emplaced into these rocks at 92 Mas. Mineralization The Wernecke Mountains are home to many rich mineral deposits, including the largest gold deposit in the Yukon, the Eagle Gold deposit.Building Canada's next gold mine This deposit is found is the Tombstone Plutonic Suite, a series of gold bearing intrusions stretching across Alaska and the Yukon known as the Tombstone Gold Belt. These deposits are characterized by sheeted mineralized veins within granitoid intrusions and fault-veins, breccias and replacement style mineralization in the country rocks. The Eagle Gold deposit in particular is a hydrothermal vein hosted gold deposit. The gold bearing veins cut through felsic intrusions and country rock, dipping south and striking NE.

She spent a large part of her career serving the Dover-Calais cross channel ferry route with successive operators. She is currently in service with Polferries as the Wawel. Early years The Wawel started life as the Scandinavia, ordered by and for Rederi AB Nord√∂, Malm√∂ for services in the Eastern Mediterranean. She was launched at the Kockums Varv AB shipyard in Malm√∂, Sweden on 1 December 1979 and delivered to Rederi AB Nord√∂ on 17 March 1980, opening a service between Koper, Yugoslavia and Tartous, Syria in April 1980. On 7 June 1980, the Scandinavias sister ship, Zenobia capsized on her maiden voyage roughly 2 km away from Larnaca, Cyprus, this precipitated the end of Rederi's Yugoslavia to Syria service. In April 1982 the two remaining vessels Scandinavia and her sister Ariadne were sold to Bulgarian So Mejdunaroden Automobile Transport (SOMAT) and the Scandinavia was renamed Tzarevetz. Under SOMAT ownership, the Tzarevetz was operated using the MedLink brand running trans-Mediterranean services until 1984 when she was chartered back to Rederi AB to run a service between Greece and Italy. A further charter in 1987 saw her transfer first to the Baltic Sea, and then later in 1988 a brief charter running a service in the North Sea for DFDS. In November 1988, both the Tzarvetz and her sister, which had been renamed Trapezitza were sold to Sealink British Ferries. Sealink to Stena Following the purchase by Sealink British Ferries she was renamed to Fiesta and undertook some charter work in Africa. After only a few trips, the Fiestas crew resigned due to worries over piracy near Lagos, Nigeria and she was consequently laid up in the Fal. Sealink eventually decided to use the two vessels, in a pooling agreement with SNCF to provide a joint service running between Dover and Calais. As a result of this decision, the Fiesta and her sister, now named Fantasia were sent to Lloyd Werft, Bremerhaven in June 1989 to be converted from freight carriers to passenger carriers. As part of the pooling agreement, the Fantasia was to be given to SNCF, as a result of this, whilst at Bremerhaven, the two vessels swapped names. The Fantasia returned to Dover on 8 March 1990, her owners had in the meantime been acquired by Stena Line. The joint services were renamed initially to Sealink Stena Line, under the new branding, in October 1990 it was announced that the Fantasia would become the Stena Fantasia. In December 1990 she was sent to A&P; Appledore for a major overhaul following maneuverability issues and bow visor problems at Calais on 2 December, returning just after Christmas with her new name. Ongoing maneuverability issues resulted in a starboard hole following her spending 8 hrs pinned against the mooring quay in Dover during bad weather on 8 January 1991. She was sent to Rotterdam for repairs and at the same time her stern was adjusted to make it compatible with the docks at Calais. The maneuverability issues were not finally fixed until a further refit in Gothenburg beginning 6 November 1991 returning to Dover-Calais service in December 1991. In 1993, the Stena Fantasia became the first cross-channel ferry to carry a McDonald's restaurant, having been installed during a refit at Bremerhaven that year. In July 1995 SNCF announced their intention to withdraw from the pooling agreement which had been set up in 1989 to operate a new service under the name of SeaFrance from 1996. As a result of this, Stena Sealink Line dropped the 'Sealink' to become Stena Line as of 31 December 1995. The Stena Fantasia continued service with Stena Line and transferred on 10 March 1998 to the newly formed joint venture of P&O; Stena Line with the merger of P&O; European Ferries and Stena Lines eastern channel routes. As a result of this change, and the new companies attempt to merge the two fleets, the P&O; Stena 'Brand World' was rolled out across the fleet, this included the renaming of all vessels in the new fleet, Stena Fantasia consequently became P&OSL; Canterbury during her December 1998 refit. Under P&O; Stena Line P&OSL; Canterbury continued the Dover-Calais route, on 11 August 1999 she was hired out on charter to the Daily Mail to enable passengers to view the European Solar Eclipse. This era was not without fault, with further bow door problems in April 2000 and flooding of a machine room in May 2001 causing her to be taken out of service for repairs both times. In October 2002, P&O; bought Stena Lines' 40% share in P&O; Stena Line and the vessel was speedily renamed PO Canterbury, then returning after her winter refit as the Pride of Canterbury for a short service in Spring 2003. In mid-May 2003, Pride of Canterbury was laid up in Dunkirk awaiting disposal, thus ending her 13 year career on the Dover-Calais route. She was sold to GA Ferries of Greece in October 2003 but did not depart until March 2004. The car deck in 2006 Post P&O; In March 2004, the new owners GA Ferries renamed the vessel to Alkmini A, operating a service between Igoumenitsa, Greece and Brindisi, Italy from June 2004, this however was not to last and in September 2004 the Alkmini A was sold to Polferries and transferred to the Baltic Sea as the Wawel operating a route from 15 February 2005 between Swinoujscie, Poland and Ystad, Sweden. In October 2008 she was chartered to DFDS to continue this route, both DFDS and Polferries now operate this route in collaboration.

History The congregation observed an Orthodox style of worship until 1883, when it joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the Reform movement. In 1885, the members who wanted B'nai Israel to continue to follow Orthodox tradition split off to form their own congregation, Congregation Montefiore (which later affiliated itself with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism). In 1973, Conservative Montefiore and Reform B'nai Israel merged to form Kol Ami. Salt Lake City‚Äôs Jewish community dates back to approximately 1854. The present congregation is the result of a successful 1972 merger of Congregation B‚Äônai Israel (Reform founded in 1891) and Congregation Montefiore (Conservative founded in 1899). The Utah Jewish population numbers approximately 5,000, with membership at Kol Ami at approximately 350 family units, or roughly 1/4 of the Jewish population of Utah. Being a part of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism and the Union for Reform Judaism gives the congregation a unique and enjoyable atmosphere to explore new ways of expressing Jewish faith. In 1917, Simon Bamberger became the Jewish governor of the state of Utah. Louis Marcus became the first Jewish Mayor of Utah in 1932. Notable events In July 2014, a 22-year-old Salt Lake City man was convicted and sentenced to serve five years in prison for shooting out windows at the synagogue. The man, Macon Openshaw, was also ordered to pay over $1900(US) in restitution. In October 2018 Congregation hosted an interfaith candlelight vigil in memory of those who died in the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, Oct. 27.

Massapeal released four studio albums, Nobody Likes a Thinker (1986), Jazz (1989), The Mechanic (1992) and Nommo Anagonno (1994), before disbanding late in 1994.  History  Massappeal were a pioneering Sydney-based hardcore punk band formed in early 1985 by Brett Curotta on guitar (ex-Bedspreads), Darren Gilmour on drums (ex-Rocks, Climate of Fear), Kevin McCrear on bass guitar, and Randy Reimann on lead vocals. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, they \\"mixed breakneck punk tempos with unrelenting heavy metal guitar riffs to arrive at a potent and rough-hewn sound.\\" The band learned of hardcore punk from the US and UK via tape trading and by reading zines. The band's first gig was on Mardi-Gras night in 1985 in Sydney. They first made their music available-a live taping-on a compilation tape for a fanzine entitled Zit. Waterfront Records asked the band to record a demo in May 1986 and an album, Nobody Likes a Thinker, which was released in December 1986. It was reviewed positively in Australian music magazines and daily newspapers. The album garnered the number 1 spot on the Australian indie charts. The band toured Australia, first with fellow Sydney band and label mates Hard-Ons, and later with the US band DRI. Darren left the band in 1987 and Tubby(Alex) Wadsworth, a drummer from the metal scene, took over on drums. After Tubby left the band in 1988, Curotta reached out to Dave Ross (ex-Civil Dissident, Vicious Circle, Nobody's Victim) to fill the drumming seat. Ross re-located his home base from Melbourne to Sydney and soon after Sean Fonti (ex-My Heart Bleeds for You) replaced McCrear on bass guitar. During this transition period, the Massappeal sound developed a slower, more complex intensity that framed the musical stylings of much of their follow up album Jazz (1989). Later that year, Massappeal toured nationally supporting Rollins Band. The band's sound continued to develop, maintaining the intensity of its thrash based roots while exploring more dynamic shifts in sound, incorporating light and space to complement heavy prog-rock moments. Prior to recording The Mechanic (1991) Ross left and was replaced by Peter Allen (ex-Terrible Virtue). Fonti left soon after to form Caligula with his brother Jamie and Ross on drums. Ross would later form Sydney based outfit Bob with McCrear on bass guitar.

He started his career as a photojournalist in London and Paris, before moving to Nairobi, Kenya to work as a television news producer with the Kenyan agency Camerapix. Liberian Civil War In May 2002, Brabazon travelled to Liberia, then in the midst of civil war. He made contact with Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), a largely-undocumented insurgent group fighting to overthrow President Charles Taylor. Brabazon followed their march through the country towards the capital Monrovia, becoming the only journalist to film the group inside Liberia. In the course of his reporting, Brabazon recorded evidence of atrocities committed by LURD, including the torture and execution of government soldiers, and the murder of prisoners of war for ritual cannibalism.Brabazon 2011, pp. 148‚Äì149. However, Brabazon has cautioned against \\"the stereotype of the bloodthirsty African rebel\\": Brabazon has stated that he was successfully treated for post-traumatic stress disorder on his return from Liberia.Brabazon 2011, p. 188. In October 2002 and June 2003 Brabazon made two return trips to Liberia, the latter with photographer Tim Hetherington.Brabazon 2011, p. 314, 243. The events of the Liberian civil war formed the basis for Brabazon's documentaries Liberia: A Journey Without Maps (2002) and Liberia: An Uncivil War (2004). My Friend the Mercenary In Liberia, Brabazon met Nick du Toit, a South African mercenary and arms dealer. Brabazon hired du Toit as his bodyguard and the two formed a close friendship, despite Brabazon‚Äôs unease with du Toit‚Äôs past as a veteran of the apartheid-era South African Army. On being reunited in West Africa in 2003, du Toit informed Brabazon of his part in a plot to overthrow President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea.Brabazon 2011, p. 251. Du Toit offered Brabazon the opportunity to film the coup attempt, and Brabazon agreed to document the operation. However, Brabazon did not receive word from du Toit confirming that the coup attempt was going ahead and did not board the plane, as he was mourning the loss of his grandfather in England and had turned off his phone.Brabazon 2011, p. 322. The attempt to overthrow Obiang ended in disaster when Zimbabwean authorities discovered the plane being used to ferry men and equipment into Equatorial Guinea.http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/11/03/guinea.coup.pardon/index.html?iref=topnews The coup attempt gained international notoriety soon afterwards when it was claimed that Sir Mark Thatcher, son of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was involved in funding the coup.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3597196.stm Nick du Toit was arrested in Equatorial Guinea along with 14 other men.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/13/simon-mann-mercenary- renounces-war Accused of leading this group, du Toit was eventually found guilty of treason and sentenced to 34 years in the infamous Black Beach prison.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8346176.stm He was given a presidential pardon by President Obiang in 2009, having served five years and eight months in prison.Brabazon 2011, p. 419. Du Toit has claimed that he was tortured, beaten and starved while in prison. Brabazon has spoken of feeling both guilt and relief on learning that he had narrowly missed du Toit‚Äôs fate. Brabazon‚Äôs memoir My Friend the Mercenary tells the story of his friendship with du Toit and the events leading up to the coup attempt.Brabazon 2011 In March 2014, the NPR radio series Snap Judgment featured an extended interview with Brabazon, in which he reflected on his work in Liberia and his friendship with du Toit.

The other dress has a clear separation between bodice and skirt. September 1905 \\"Princess line\\" or \\"princess dress\\" describes a woman's fitted dress or other garment cut in long panels without a horizontal join or separation at the waist. Instead of relying on darts to shape the garment, the fit is achieved with long seams (\\"princess seams\\") and shaped pattern pieces. A rarely used alternative name for the Princess line was French-dart-line dress. History =19th century= The princess line is popularly associated with Charles Frederick Worth who first introduced it in the early 1870s. It was named in honour of the famously elegant Princess Alexandra. By the late 1870s and early 1880s the Princess dress was a popular style. It is considered one of the first \\"bodycon\\" (body-conscious) fashions due to its extremely closely fitted design, presenting the figure in a natural (or at least, corseted) form undistorted by either crinoline or bustle. 'Princess-line polonaises' were worn over long underskirts. The Princess line was also popular for young girls, who wore it with a sash or, if slightly older, over a longer underskirt. =20th century= The Princess line was a staple of dress design and construction throughout the century. In 1951 the couturier Christian Dior presented a princess-line based fashion collection which is sometimes called the 'Princess Line,' although its official name was Ligne Longue or 'Long Line'. =21st century= The Princess line remains a popular style for wedding dresses and a design staple for both day and evening dresses. More recently, the design principle has been consciously applied to men's garments, which generally do not have waist seams anyway.

His set of diaries are recognised as one of the most extensive and well written first hand accounts of military service in World War I. Early life Barwick was born at Colebrook, Monmouth County (now known as Southern Midlands Council), Tasmania on 7 March 1890, to George Arthur Sturgeon Barwick and Elizabeth Ann Barwick. He worked from an early age on the family's farm near Hobart, Tasmania. He received an education and was raised in the Anglican Christian faith. As a young man he obtained a farm managers position on Alex Mitchell's Surveyors Creek property near Woolbrook, high in the New England district of New South Wales, raising sheep. World War I Archie Barwick enlisted in World War I at 24 years of age at Randwick, New South Wales on the 24 August 1914, in what was expected to be a great adventure, just 3 weeks after the British Empire declared war on the German Empire. He served mostly in the 1st Battalion (aka Sydney Regiment) in C Company. He was enthusiastic about enlisting, recording in his diary that he \\"threw 2 or 3 somersaults\\" in celebration. He was measured by the Army at 5‚Äô 4‚Äù height and 152lbs weight, with ruddy complexion, fair hair and blue eyes. He was equipped for the infantry at Randwick Racecourse Camp, and underwent basic training at Kensington Racecourse Camp (now UNSW) for 7 weeks. Barwick embarked in the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) sailing on the steamship HMAT A19 'Afric' on 18 October 1914 and stopped at Albany, Western Australia, from 25-31 Oct 1914 for a gathering of military ships. The First ANZAC Convoy was then formed, comprising 38 transport ships, full of adventurers off to war, and escorted by 4 warships. Tragically for most of the men on board, they left Australia for the very last time on 1 Nov 1914. They sailed north across the Indian Ocean and were warned about the presence of enemy warships on 8 Nov 1914, and then the ships were blacked out at night. As the convoy passed the Cocos Islands the next day, the escort cruiser HMAS ‚ÄòSydney‚Äô detached. It fought a battle with the German cruiser ‚ÄòEmden‚Äô and destroyed it on 9 Nov (memorial gun in Hyde Park, Sydney). The convoy stopped at Colombo, British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), from 15-16 Nov for supplies, and the battle scarred ‚ÄòSydney‚Äô rejoined them. The convoy continued to Suez, Egypt, Africa and stopped from 1-2 Dec 1914 for military instructions, and then sailed north through the Suez Canal on 3 Dec and reached Alexandria, Egypt on 5 Dec. Barwick and the 1st Battalion disembarked into the exotic and historical land of Egypt on 9 December 1914. They went by train south to its capital city of Cairo and set up Mena Camp beneath the famous Pyramids. Barwick, like many soldiers, climbed the Pyramid of Khafre and the Pyramid of Khufu, and considered the limestone capped Khafre to be the more difficult. He celebrated Christmas away from family and home, and in the winter there. They underwent military training for 3 months including musketry and attack tactics and co- ordinating with other units. During regular periods of leave they would usually go into Cairo, and explore the maze of souks (aka markets) and have wild parties in the cafes and bars. He was joined in C Company of 1st Battalion by his young brother Len Barwick on 3 Apr 1915, as they were leaving Mena Camp. They were fortunate in having each of others friendship, support and care, to help survive the hard, desperate and violent war years. Barwick was sent to war and fought with British Forces against Turk Forces in the bloodbath of the Gallipoli Campaign in European Turkey of Apr 1915 to Jan 1916, where the British aimed to capture the Turk capital of Constantinople (now Istanbul). It resulted in a British defeat and loss of 250K British and 300K Turk casualties. They were shipped on HMT 'Minniwaaka' from Alexandria on 4 Apr 1915, and sailed north across the Mediterranean Sea, and stopped at Mudros, Lemnos Island, Greece from 8-24 Apr, for a gathering of an invasion armada. They would leave the ship for periods of training including amphibious landings on Lemnos. The 1st Battalion, attached to the Australian 1st Brigade, attached to the Australian 1st Division, all sailed on the night of 24 Apr to the combat zone off Gallipoli. They watched and were deafened in shock and awe, as the accompanying British Royal Navy battleships launched a preparatory bombardment down on Turk positions on Gallipoli. On the journey there, the soldiers were paid with Turkish currency, which Barwick said in his diary showed the confidence of success of the British. He fought in the Battle of the Landing at ANZAC on 25-26 Apr 1915, where the British launched an amphibious assault and established a foothold on the rugged peninsula of Gallipoli (now ANZAC Day) and also in the Battle of the Defence of ANZAC on 19-21 May 1915. He fought in the Battle of Sari Bair on 6-10 Aug 1915 including the Battle of Lone Pine. There his 1st Battalion comrades Len Keysor was awarded the Victoria Cross for quickly throwing back unexploded Turk bombs on the 7 and 8 Aug, and Alfred Shout was awarded the Victoria Cross for charging down lost trenches throwing bombs at Turks on the 9 Aug. Barwick fought in the Action of Hill 60, Suvla on 21-27 Aug 1915 and remarkably survived 8 months of conflict. He was in the second last group to leave Gallipoli, during the successful Evacuation of ANZAC on 19-20 Dec 1915. Barwick said it was \\"one of the most glorious and at the same time disastrous campaigns as Great Britain ever had anything to do with\\". Barwick returned to Alexandria on 28 Dec 1915 and fell sick with septic sores and was separated from his brother Len. He slowly recovered over 6 weeks in Cairo and then joined the Egyptian Campaign. He went to the combat zone of the Suez Canal and rejoined his brother Len in the 1st Battalion at Serapeum on 6 Mar 1916, as they guarded the east bank of the canal in the Sinai Desert. Most of the AIF were transferred as reinforcements to the disastrous Western Front Theatre in France, Europe. The 1st Battalion embarked from Alexandria on 22 Mar 1916 and sailed west across the Mediterranean Sea and landed at Marseilles, France on 28 Mar 1916 and went by train north for 1,000kms to the combat zone of Flanders. Barwick returned to the nightmare of trench warfare, fighting in the Flanders Trenches Campaign. He was separated from his brother again, when Len contracted an illness on 22 Jun 1916 and slowly recovered in France. Archie Barwick fought on with French Forces and British Forces against German Forces in the fearful Somme Offensive in Picardy, including in the Battle of Pozi√®res on 23 Jul-3 Sep 1916, where he was promoted in the field to Corporal on 1 Aug 1916. His company was involved in the capture of the town of Pozi√®res under a \\"fearful bombardment\\" of German shells. He was promoted to Sergeant on 26 Oct 1916 and rejoined by his brother Len in the Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette on 4-19 Nov 1916, where Archie Barwick was wounded in action on 5 Nov, but continued to soldier on. The next year he was separated from his brother again, when Len transferred to the ANZAC Workshops in France on 2 Feb 1917. Archie Barwick fought in an engagement near Demicourt, Artois, in the Hindenburg Line Campaign, and was wounded in action again, with a gunshot through his right shoulder on 8 Apr 1917. He was admitted to the 6th General Hospital in Rouen, Normandy and made a quick recovery and rejoined the 1st Battalion on 22 Apr 1917, as it was fighting up to the Hindenburg Line. He fought in the Battle of Bullecourt II from 3-17 May 1917, where his 1st Battalion comrade George Howell was awarded the Victoria Cross for running along a parapet of a lost trench throwing bombs down on Germans on the 6 May 1917. After nearly a year of conflict, he was luckily transferred away from the battle on 6 May 1917. Barwick obtained a position as an Instructor for the Australian 1st Training Battalion at Durrington Camp near Salisbury, Wiltshire, England. He undertook training at Tidworth for 6 weeks and then worked for 3 months. However he was returned the War and shipped from Southampton over to Le Havre, France, on the night of 25 Sep 1917. He fought with British Forces against German Forces in the blood and mud of the Ypres 1917 Campaign in Belgium and rejoined the 1st Battalion there on 2 Oct 1917. They were preparing to go into action and he fought in the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 Oct 1917, and in the Battle of Poelcappelle on 9 Oct 1917 and in the Battle of Passchendaele II on 26 Oct-10 Nov 1917. Later the King of Belgium recognised his 'conspicuous services rendered'. The next year Barwick fought with French Forces and British Forces against German Forces in the desperate German Offensive Campaign, including in the Battle of the Lys, Flanders from 9-29 Apr 1918. After a further 6 months conflict, he was wounded in action for a third occasion, when an exploding shell in the battle caused severe chest injuries on 15 Apr 1918. He was admitted to hospital in Etaples, but his condition was serious and he was transferred to Queens Civil Hospital Birmingham, Warwickshire, England on 20 Apr 1918 for 9 weeks treatment. He was discharged to leave in London but unfortunately caught the Spanish Flu and was admitted to Harefield Hospital, Wiltshire on 26 Jun 1918 for 3 weeks treatment. He recovered and was transferred to the Australian No.1 Convalescent Unit at Sutton Veny, Wiltshire on 18 Jul 1918. After 6 months treatment and rehabilitation he obtained Special Leave for 1914 soldiers and went to St Budeux Barracks, Devenport on 16 Oct 1918. He shipped out of England on 3 Dec 1918 and returned to Australia, landing at Melbourne on 27 Jan 1919. Barwick was discharged from the AIF as a Sergeant after 5 years service at Hobart on 30 Mar 1919. His two brothers Leonard George Barwick (known as Len & b 1894) and Norman Stanley Barwick (known as Stan & 1891-1917) also served in World War I. Len enlisted at Liverpool, New South Wales on 26 October 1914 and served mostly in the 1st Battalion, alongside Archie. He obtained Special Leave for 1914 soldiers and returned to Australia, landing at Melbourne on 2 Dec 1918. Stan enlisted at Clermont, Tasmania on 8 July 1916 and served mostly in the 12th Battalion.National Archives Aus ADF Personnel Rec-Army-WWI sB2455 6617 1914-20 After training in England, Stan was sent to war and went to the 1st Australian Division Base Depot at Etaples, France on 11 Apr 1917, where he was reunited with his brother Archie recovering from his second wound, from 16-21 April 1917. Stan was killed in action near Remus Wood, Belgium on 8 October 1917. He was commemorated with 54,000 men whose graves are not known at Menin Gate Memorial, Ypres, Belgium. =Honours= Barwick was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre on 19 January 1918, receiving notification on 5 February 1918. His award was published in the London Gazette on 12 Jul 1918, and in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette on 27 Nov 1918. He was presented with his medal in England on 13 September 1918. Barwick was one of the six Australians whose war experiences were presented in The War That Changed Us, a four-part television documentary series about Australia's involvement in World War I. He has also featured in projects such as AnzacLive and Anzac360.ac360. =Diary= Barwick wrote 16 diaries documenting his war service, approximately 400,000 words in total. He tried to keep a daily record of his experiences, however he was sometimes forced to write entries later or from notes. His diaries are noted for their detailed description of his experiences and for their style, which has been described as similar to the Boys' Own publications.

In so ruling, the Court partially overruled Sinclair Investments (UK) Ltd v Versailles Trade Finance Ltd (a decision of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales) in favour of The Attorney General for Hong Kong v Reid (New Zealand) (UKPC), a ruling from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on appeal from New Zealand. Facts Cedar Capital Partners LLC (\\"Cedar\\" or \\"the defendants\\") provided consultancy services to the hotel industry. Cedar agreed to act as the agent of FHR European Ventures LLPA joint venture of Fairmont Hotels, Kingdom Holding Company and the Bank of Scotland (\\"the Purchaser\\" or \\"FHR\\" or \\"the claimants\\") in negotiations for purchase of share capital in Monte Carlo Grand Hotel SAMA Monegasque company which owned a long leasehold interest in the Monte Carlo Grand Hotel, located in Monte Carlo, Monaco from Monte Carlo Grand Hotel LtdA British Virgin Islands company (\\"the Vendor\\" or \\"Monte Carlo\\"). * In September 2004, Cedar entered into an agreement with the Vendor which provided for the payment to Cedar of a ‚Ç¨10m fee following a successful conclusion of the sale and purchase of the issued share capital of Monte Carlo Grand Hotel SAM. * In December 2004, the sale went ahead: the Purchaser acquired the issued share capital of Monte Carlo Grand Hotel SAM from the Vendor for ‚Ç¨211.5m. * In January 2005, the Vendor paid Cedar the ‚Ç¨10m commission. * In November 2009 the Purchaser commenced an action for recovery of the sum of ‚Ç¨10m from Cedar and other parties on the ground of breach of fiduciary duty. The Purchaser argued that Cedar owed a fiduciary duty. In breach of that fiduciary duty, Cedar had made a secret commission. The Purchaser argued that this secret commission was now held on constructive trust. Judgment =High Court= Simon J ruled in favour of the claimants, concluding that he should: #Make a declaration of liability for breach of fiduciary duty on the part of Cedar for having failed to obtain the claimants' fully informed consent in respect of the ‚Ç¨10m; and #Order Cedar to pay such sum to the claimants, but, in a further ruling, #He refused to grant the claimants a proprietary remedy in respect of the monies. In the latter ruling, he held that he was bound by the precedents in Sinclair and Cadogan. He stated: Accordingly, he issued the following declaration: The Claimants appealed the ruling as to the declaration issued, submitting that it should be in the form of a proprietary remedy instead. =Court of Appeal= In a unanimous decision, the appeal was allowed. Lewison LJ acknowledged that, as Sinclair had endorsed Metropolitan Bank v Heiron and Lister & Co v Stubbs,holding that a trustee had an equitable duty to account, but no proprietary interest he was bound to follow them as well.EWCA, par. 29 Upon reviewing the authorities, he felt he could distinguish the case on the facts: Etherton C also agreed that the appeal should be allowed, but emphasised that Boardman v Phipps had received inadequate consideration in the reasoning underlying Sinclair.EWCA, par. 8997 Pill LJ agreed with both judgments. Cedar appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court. =Supreme Court= The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, and held that Cedar (the defendants) held the ‚Ç¨10m commission on constructive trust for FHR (the claimants). Lord Neuberger gave the leading judgment, with which the whole Court agreed. Previous jurisprudence =Fiduciary duties= The following general principles were summarized in Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew: #An agent owes a fiduciary duty to his principal because he is \\"someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of [his principal] in a particular matter in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence\\". #As a result, an agent \\"must not make a profit out of his trust\\" and \\"must not place himself in a position in which his duty and his interest may conflict.\\" In that regard, the former proposition is \\"part of the [latter] wider rule\\". #\\"[A] fiduciary who acts for two principals with potentially conflicting interests without the informed consent of both is in breach of the obligation of undivided loyalty; he puts himself in a position where his duty to one principal may conflict with his duty to the other.\\" Such \\"informed consent\\" is only effective if it is given after \\"full disclosure.\\" Where an agent receives a benefit in breach of his fiduciary duty, it is obliged to account to the principal for such a benefit, and to pay, in effect, a sum equal to the profit by way of equitable compensation. As Lord Russell explained in Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver: Where an agent acquires a benefit in breach of his fiduciary duty, the relief accorded by equity is \\"primarily restitutionary or restorative rather than compensatory,\\"Mothew, at p 18 representing a personal remedy for the principal against the agent. However, in some cases where an agent acquires a benefit which came to his notice as a result of his fiduciary position, or pursuant to an opportunity which results from his fiduciary position, the equitable rule is that he is to be treated as having acquired the benefit on behalf of his principal, so that it is beneficially owned by the principal. In such cases, the principal has a proprietary remedy in addition to his personal remedy against the agent, and the principal can elect between the two remedies.UKSC, par. 7 The equitable rule is strictly applied, and has its origins in the 1726 case of Keech v Sandford. =Other jurisdictions= Extensive debate occurred as to the limits and boundaries of the equitable rule, especially where a bribe or secret commission was obtained by an agent in breach of his fiduciary duty to his principal: :*Several commentators contended that it is not a benefit which can properly be said to be the property of the principal. This view has been supported in Sinclair. :*Others submitted that, where an agent receives a benefit, which is, or results from, a breach of the fiduciary duty owed to his principal, the agent holds the benefit on trust for the principal. This has received legal recognition in Reid. Sinclair was seen to be the more controversial decision,EWCA, par. 17 and has attracted considerable debate in academic literature.UKSC, par. 29 The Court of Appeal of Singapore preferred to follow Reid instead, as has the Federal Court of Australia and the British Columbia Court of Appeal., applying In England and Wales, several judges have expressed a preference for Reid. United States jurisprudence has tended to be similar to Reid.United States v Carter, Significance of FHR FHR was significant in several respects: :* The view that an agent should not hold a bribe or commission on trust, because he could not have acquired it on behalf of his principal, is inconsistent with several long-standing English decisions., on appeal from Upper Canada :* Tyrrell v Bank of London, (upon which Heiron and Lister were based) was disapproved, as it failed to consider the previous decision in Fawcett v Whitehouse, and therefore should not be followed,UKSC, par. 49 and :* any subsequent decisions,Powell & Thomas [1905] 1 KB 11, Attorney-General's Reference (No 1 of 1985) [1986] 1 QB 491 and Sinclair at least in so far as they relied on or followed Heiron and Lister, should be treated as overruled.UKSC, par. 50 =Consequences= While Reid was concerned with a criminal situation, FHR arose from a commercial one. It is argued that a proprietary remedy for bribes and secret commissions can thus be awarded in a variety of situations: :*payments as disguised fees or loans by vendors or landlords to agents, and :*transfers of shares, or payments to a trustee, in order to induce a desired action. The practical implications have been asserted as extending over a broad range: #It encompasses all manner of fiduciary relationships, including employer-employee, company-director, some categories of public official, and trustee-beneficiary. #While the proprietary remedy will allow tracing into the assets of the agent and any relevant third parties in order to claim any fruits of the fraud, a personal claim is still available where it may yield greater value. #The proprietary remedy also attracts ancillary measures, including freezing injunctions and Chabra relief.Derived from TSB Private Bank International S.A. v Chabra, [1992] 1 WLR 231, where it was held that, so long as the claimant had a good arguable cause of action against one defendant, there was power to grant an injunction against another defendant against whom no cause of action lay, provided that the claim to the injunction was \\"ancillary and incidental\\" to the cause of action against the initial defendant. . The scope of such jurisdiction was subsequently explained in greater detail in #Under English law, proprietary claims to bribes and secret commissions may not be time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980, as it may amount to a claim to recover trust property.At s. 21(1)(b). #As the ruling will allow civil cases to conduct more factual enquiries into the circumstances surrounding secret payments, it will be necessary for agents to disclose such activities more extensively and to obtain appropriate approval from their principals. #As claimant-principals will now be able to assert title to bribes and secret commissions in their agent‚Äôs hands, unsecured creditors may lose out in any connected insolvency proceedings. In its judgment, the Supreme Court addressed the divergence of opinions arising in the various common law jurisdictions: It also gave guidance in assessing the relevance of prior jurisprudence: See also *English trusts law Further reading * * References Category:Supreme Court of the United Kingdom cases Category:2014 in case law Category:2014 in British law Category:English trusts case law ","title":"FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC"},{"id":"43322026","text":"Super Typhoon Joan was a super typhoon that hit Taiwan in 1959. Joan was the strongest typhoon of 1959 Pacific typhoon season.  Meteorological history  On August 25, Tropical Storm Joan formed in the open Western Pacific, and attained typhoon status early the next day. As Joan moved to the west- northwest, it continued to rapidly intensify, reaching Super Typhoon status on the 28th and peak winds of 195 mph (314 km/h) on the 29th. Such winds are dubious, due to the infancy of Reconnaissance Aircraft at the time and the lack of satellite images. Nevertheless, Joan was a powerful typhoon, and struck eastern Taiwan with estimated winds of 185 mph (298 km/h) on the 29th. It rapidly weakened while crossing the island and the Formosa Strait, and dissipated over China on the 31st.  Impact  Roughly 140,000 people were evacuated to safer buildings across Taiwan. More than 33,000 people were evacuated to public buildings in Taipei, and more than 6,600 took shelter in Keelung. Joan's approach disrupted international air traffic to the island for 36 hours. According to data from the JTWC, Joan's sustained winds upon its Taiwan landfall were among the strongest in recorded history. At least 11 people were killed by Joan in Taiwan, and another 74 people were injured. The storm also destroyed 3,308 homes and caused $3 million in crop damage. The counties of Nantou and Pingtung bore the brunt of crop damage, with significant losses reported to banana, papaya, and rice. The loss of 20,000 banana trees in Nantou was valued at $555,000. About 50,000 homes were evacuated in Fuzhou. On Mainland China, there were 60 casualties, including 3 deaths. Rainfall from Joan caused several rivers on the Korean peninsula to overflow their banks, killing 17 people and injuring 21. Another 7,000 people were rendered homeless.

As of 2014, Baltimore is home to a small Native American population, centered in East Baltimore. The majority of Native Americans now living in Baltimore belong to the Lumbee, Piscataway, and Cherokee tribes. The Piscataway tribe is indigenous to Southern Maryland, living in the area for centuries prior to European colonization. The Lumbee and Cherokee are indigenous to North Carolina and neighboring states of the Southeastern United States. Many of the Lumbee and Cherokee migrated to Baltimore during the mid-20th century along with other migrants from the Southern United States, such as African-Americans and white Appalachians. Demographics As of the 2000 United States Census, there were 6,976 Native Americans in the Baltimore metropolitan area, making up 0.3% of the area's population. In 2013, 370 Cherokee people and 87 Navajo people lived in Baltimore city, 0.1% and 0.0% of the population respectively. No residents of Baltimore were Chippewa or Sioux. As of September 2014, speakers of Native American languages were the twenty-seventh largest group of language speakers in Baltimore. Pre-history The Baltimore area had been inhabited by Native Americans since at least the 10th millennium BC, when Paleo-Indians first settled in the region. One Paleo-Indian site and several Archaic period and Woodland period archaeological sites have been identified in Baltimore, including four from the Late Woodland period. During the Late Woodland period, the archaeological culture that is called the \\"Potomac Creek complex\\" resided in the area from Baltimore to the Rappahannock River in Virginia, primarily along the Potomac River downstream from the Fall Line. Early history In the early 1600s, the immediate Baltimore vicinity was sparsely populated, if at all, by Native Americans. The Baltimore County area northward was used as hunting grounds by the Susquehannocks living in the lower Susquehanna River valley who \\"controlled all of the upper tributaries of the Chesapeake\\" but \\"refrained from much contact with Powhatan in the Potomac region.\\" Pressured by the Susquehannocks, the Piscataway tribe of Algonquians stayed well south of the Baltimore area and inhabited primarily the north bank of the Potomac River in what is now Charles and southern Prince George's south of the Fall Line As depicted on a map of the Piscataway lands in Kenneth Bryson, Images of America: Accokeek (Arcadia Publishing, 2013) pp. 10-11, derived from Alice and Henry Ferguson, The Piscataway Indians of Southern Maryland (Alice Ferguson Foundation, 1960) pp. 8 (map) and p. 11: \\"By the beginning of Maryland (English) settlement, pressure from the Susquehannocks had reduced..the Piscataway 'empire'...to a belt bordering the Potomac south of the falls and extending up the principle tributaries. Roughly, the 'empire' covered the southern half of present Prince Georges County and all, or nearly all, of Charles County.\\" as depicted on John Smith's 1608 map which faithfully mapped settlements, mapped none in the Baltimore vicinity, while noting a dozen Patuxent River settlements that were under some degree of Piscataway suzerainty. In 1608, Captain John Smith traveled 210 miles from Jamestown to the uppermost Chesapeake Bay, leading the first European expedition to the Patapsco River, a word used by the Algonquin language natives who fished shellfish and hunted.A Point of Natural Origin and Locust Point ‚Äì Celebrating 300 Years of a Historic Community , Scott Sheads, Mylocustpoint. The name \\"Patapsco\\" is derived from pota-psk-ut, which translates to \\"backwater\\" or \\"tide covered with froth\\" in Algonquian dialect. The Chesapeake Bay was named after the Chesapeake tribe of Virginia. \\"Chesapeake\\" is derived from the Algonquian word Chesepiooc referring to a village \\"at a big river.\\" It is the seventh oldest surviving English place-name in the U.S., first applied as \\"Chesepiook\\" by explorers heading north from the Roanoke Colony into a Chesapeake tributary in 1585 or 1586.Also shown as \\"Chisupioc\\" (by John Smith of Jamestown) and \\"Chisapeack\\", in Algonquian \\"Che\\" means \\"big\\" or \\"great\\", \\"sepi\\" means river, and the \\"oc\\" or \\"ok\\" ending indicated something (a village, in this case) \\"at\\" that feature. \\"Sepi\\" is also found in another placename of Algonquian origin, Mississippi. The name was soon transferred by the English from the big river at that site to the big bay. In 2005, Algonquian linguist Blair A. Rudes \\"helped to dispel one of the area's most widely held beliefs: that 'Chesapeake' means something like 'Great Shellfish Bay.' It does not, Rudes said. The name might actually mean something like 'Great Water,' or it might have been just a village at the bay's mouth.\\" Soon after John Smith's voyage, English colonists began to settle in Maryland. The English were initially frightened by the Piscataway because of their body paint and war regalia, even though they were a peaceful tribe. The chief of the Piscataway was quick to grant the English permission to settle within Piscataway territory and cordial relations were established between the English and the Piscataway. Beginning in the 1620s, English settlers from the Colony of Virginia began to trade with the Algonquians, in particular the Piscataway tribe of Southern Maryland. Because the northern part of the Chesapeake Bay area had more trees, there were also more beavers. The colonists from Virginia traded English cloth and metal tools in exchange for beaver pelts. This trade was supported by Lord Baltimore, who felt that more revenue could be gained from taxation of the fur trade than from tobacco farming. Lord Baltimore also wanted to maintain friendly relations with the native Algonquians in order to create a buffer from the Susquehannock, an Iroquoian-speaking tribe to the north that was hostile to the English presence. In exchange for cooperation with the English colonists, tribes on the Eastern Shore of the United States were given grants from English proprietors that protected their lands. The tribes paid for the grants by exchanging beaver belts. A number of English fur traders help pay the rents for Native Americans in order to prevent tobacco farmers from driving Native Americans off of their lands. Nonetheless, English tobacco farmers gradually acquired more and more land from Native Americans, which hindered Native Americans from moving around freely in search of food. While the English had established treaties with Native Americans that protected their rights to \\"hunting, fowling, crabbing, and fishing\\", in practice the English did not respect the treaties and Native Americans were eventually moved to reservations. In 1642, the Province of Maryland declared war on several Native American groups, including the Susquehannocks. The Susquehannocks were armed with guns they had received from Swedish colonists in the settlement of New Sweden. The Swedes were friendly with the Susquehannock and wanted to maintain a trading relationship, in addition to wanting to prevent the English from expanding their presence further into Delaware. With the assistance of the Swedes, the Susquehannock defeated the English in 1644. In 1652, the Susquehannock made peace with the colonists and ceded large tracts of land to the colony. The tribe had suffered a recent loss in a war with the Iroquois, and could not maintain two wars at once. Because both the Susquehannock and the English considered the Iroquois to be their enemy, they decided to cooperate to prevent Iroquois expansion into their territories. This alliance between the Susquehannock and the English lasted for 20 years. However, the English badly treated their Susquehannock allies. In 1674, the English forced the Susquehannock to relocate to the shores of the Potomac River. Modern history Baltimore American Indian Center viewed from the street, 2011. The Lumbee are originally from North Carolina, where they are concentrated in Robeson County. During the early and mid-20th century, the same wave of migration that brought large numbers of African Americans from the Deep South and poor white people from Appalachia also brought many people from the Lumbee tribe. The Baltimore American Indian Center was established in 1968 in order to serve the needs of this community. In 2011 the center established a Native American heritage museum, including exhibits on Lumbee art and culture. The urban Lumbee and other Native Americans in Baltimore are concentrated in the 6 blocks around Baltimore Street in East Baltimore. This community is the largest Lumbee community outside of the Lumbee's tribal territory. As of 1993 there were 4,300 Lumbee in Maryland, 2,500 of whom resided in Baltimore between Fleet and Fayette streets, Broadway and Milton Avenue. At the time, the South Baltimore Baptist Church at 211 S. Broadway had a congregation that was approximately 95% Lumbee. The Lumbee tend to be poor. Native Americans in Baltimore, the vast majority of whom are Lumbee, have the lowest income level of any ethnic or racial group, including white people, African-Americans, Asians, and Hispanics. High levels of unemployment, drug and alcohol abuse, and domestic violence are problems that plague the community. Over a third fall below the poverty line and the average Lumbee only has an eighth grade level education. In 2017, Native American activists in Baltimore urged the city council to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day. The Baltimore American Indian Center co-hosts an Indigenous Peoples' Day event. Bills to replace Columbus Day have so far been unable to pass the Baltimore City Council. In August 2017, a monument to Christopher Columbus was vandalized. The unidentified vandals declared the monument to be racist and denounced \\"European capitalism\\" and claimed that Christopher Columbus symbolizes \\"terrorism, murder, genocide, rape, slavery, ecological degradation and capitalist exploitation\\" directed against Native Americans and African Americans.

Plot  In the first scene of the movie, before the title credits, a prison guard is seen writing a report from an event in one of the cells, in which a dead body was found. The guard writes \\"suicide\\" as a probable cause of death. Although it is not explicitly explained, it is implied that this scene takes part after the rest of the action of the movie. On a very rainy evening a young man, ≈Åukasz Machnacki, comes out of a cinema. He is approached by policemen, who without any questions or explanation handcuff him and take him to the police car. He is forced to take part in a police lineup. ≈Åukasz does not understand anything that is happening, and is shocked to learn, during an interrogation, that he has been recognized by an elderly woman, a robbery victim, as the culprit. He maintains his innocence, but is unable to provide any alibi. The officer who interrogates him informs ≈Åukasz he's arrested and is unlikely to go back home any time soon. ≈Åukasz is then transferred into prison for a pre-trial detention. He is first put into a transition cell, in which he meets Zborek, a man arrested for car theft. Zborek explains to ≈Åukasz that he is most likely to spend no less than a year in prison before his trial. Zborek also asks ≈Åukasz if he is willing to become a \\"git\\" - a member of the prison subculture known as \\"grypsera\\" (which is also a Polish term for a prison slang used by its members), considered to be an elite among the prisoners. He also scares ≈Åukasz that if he does not join the subculture, he is likely to become \\"a loser\\" and would be abused by other prisoners. As a result, when ≈Åukasz is later interviewed by a member of the prison staff, who is about to decide where to place him, ≈Åukasz insists that he wants to take part in the \\"grypsera\\". The prison worker is surprised by this and warns ≈Åukasz he will not be able to handle it, but eventually agrees to place him in a cell with the subculture members. ≈Åukasz is led to a cell in which he meets his new cellmates - Kosior, the apparent cell leader, arrested for murdering his partner in crime; Siwy (\\"Grey\\"), a member of the mob; Albert, a minor mobster; Roman, arrested for avoiding paying child maintenance, who is visibly the lowest in the cell hierarchy; and Dawid, a very quiet man who spends most of his time reading books and seems to take no active part in the prison subculture, but is treated with respect by other prisoners anyway. ≈Åukasz is right away teased by Albert, and by Siwy, who tells him that they will have a fist fight in the evening. Scared ≈Åukasz doesn't answer anything to that but later is willing to take part in the fight, knowing he would be considered a coward if he refused. Siwy then reveals that it was just a tease, indeed meaning to check whether ≈Åukasz would do it or. Following days Roman teaches ≈Åukasz the basic rules of living in prison, while Kosior teaches him about the \\"grypsera\\". Some time later ≈Åukasz is visited in prison by an attorney hired by his mother. The lawyer informs ≈Åukasz that the prosecutor means to accuse him not only of robbery, but also unintentional homicide, as the woman who recognized him as the robber, died just a few hours later. The lawyer tells ≈Åukasz that he will do his best to get him out of prison, but the investigation may take months before anything could be done. One evening, Albert tells the cellmates a supposedly funny story of his friends, who kidnapped a girl and forced her into performing oral sex. Unexpectedly Dawid grabs Albert and threatens to break his neck, if he ever hears talk like that from him again. Next day Kosior tells ≈Åukasz Dawid's story: his wife was assaulted and raped, and Dawid found and beat to death the rapist. After that, he came to the police himself. Dawid's wife comes to see him every week, but during those visits they merely look at each other and do not say a word. ≈Åukasz, while trying to adjust to life in prison, is haunted by nightmares and continuously teased by Albert. One time he is forced to drink a mixture of detergents as a punishment for accidentally breaking one of the cell's rules. One day a prison guard tells ≈Åukasz to pack his things, as he is about to be released. When ≈Åukasz, packed and ready to go, happily says goodbyes to his cellmates, the guard opens the door and tells ≈Åukasz to unpack, and it was all just a joke. This leaves ≈Åukasz completely devastated and leads him to a failed suicide attempt. After some time of depression, ≈Åukasz starts to accept his situation. He later passes an exam of knowledge of the subculture rules with Kosior and is officially accepted as one of its members. He even wins the respect of Albert, when he claims as his some of Albert's contraband, which was discovered by the guard, knowing that Albert would be prohibited from seeing his girlfriend during a visit, if it was blamed on him. After his trial Siwy is transferred to another prison, and a new prisoner is placed in the cell in his place. Before introducing him, the prison guard tells ≈Åukasz and others that the new prisoner was arrested for child sexual abuse. When the new prisoner enters the cell, Kosior only angrily tells him to stay quiet. He is then forced to eat in the toilet, and gets beaten up in the exercise yard, which the guards see, but ignore. ≈Åukasz's attorney comes to him with good news: the prosecutor intends to remit his case because of lack of evidence, and he will most likely be released quite soon. ≈Åukasz does not respond anything and does not seem to care anymore. When he gets back to his cell, the guards informs him that the new prisoner is supposed to be released on bail. ≈Åukasz is then visited by his mother and his little sister. Seeing the suspected child abuser at the nearby table, he tells his family to go away from this place, and to remember that he loves them. ≈Åukasz informs his cellmates that the new prisoner is going to be released. Albert suggests they should kill him and make it look like a suicide, much to Kosior's approval. ≈Åukasz is hesitant about taking part in a murder, but Kosior convinces him by appealing to his care for his little sister. Roman opposes the idea, not wanting to get in any trouble, to which Albert threatens him that they will kill him as well, if he interferes. Before the planned murder ≈Åukasz knocks Roman out with a chair. As a result, Roman is taken to the hospital and left out of possible suspicion. At night, ≈Åukasz, Kosior, Albert and Dawid kill the new prisoner by strangling him and breaking his neck. They hang his body on the window bars, to make it look as he hanged himself. Next time ≈Åukasz's mother comes to visit him, they only are allowed to see each other through a glass and phone. ≈Åukasz's mother is distraught, asking her son what kind of troubles he got himself into. As she cries, ≈Åukasz tells her that life in prison is different than outside, and she would not understand. He quietly hangs up the phone and leaves.

A Persian scholar born in present-day Uzbekistan, he wrote mostly in Arabic.  Works  He authored around 100 books in Hanafi jurisprudence, theology, Quran exegesis, Hadith and history. =Theology= * Al-'Aqa'id al-Nasafiyya () or 'Aqa'id al-Nasafi () is his most celebrated work in Kalam, which alongside Al-Fiqh Al-Akbar () of Abu Hanifa and Al-'Aqeedah al-Tahawiyya () of Abu Ja'far al-Tahawi is one of the three seminal works in Sunni Islamic creed. By 17th century, more than fifty commentaries were written on this work, of which the most famous is al- Taftazani's commentary named Sharh 'Aqaid al-Nasafi (). :Abu Hafs al-Nasafi wrote the Al-'Aqaid by strictly following the structure of Tabsirat al- Adillah, the famous book by his own teacher Abu al-Mu'in al-Nasafi. Some have called the Al-'Aqaid to be a summary of Tabsirat al-Adillah. :While a few Arabic sources have shown skepticism in attributing this work to Abu Hafs al- Nasafi, a recently discovered manuscript of the Persian version of the work confirms the authorship of the work for Abu Hafs al-Nasafi. The Persian version of the work, titled Bayan-e Itiqad-e Ahl-e Sunnat wa Jama'at (), is reported on the authority of Al-Nasafi's most famous student, Burhan al-Din al-Marghinani, the author of Al-Hidayah. Al-Marghinani explains in the preface of the treatise that Abu Hafs a-Nasafi wrote this work per request made by Ahmad Sanjar, the Seljuk ruler and Sultan, when he visited Samarqand in 535 AH or 1140 CE. :Al-Marghinani explains that that one of Sultan Sanjar's rulers who was the ruler of Sistan and was accompanying the Sultan, asked the scholars of Samarqand to write a treatise on the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah so that \\"no one in Sistan could speak against it\\". Presumably, Sistan was dominated by the Karramiyya and Hanbali sects who were advocating for anthropomorphism. In response to this request, the scholars of Samarqand asked Abu Hafs al-Nasafi to write the treatise, and they all put their signatures at the end of the document. Among the scholars present in the gathering with Sultan Sanjar was Shaikh al-Islam Abd al-Hameed al-Ismandi al-Samarqandi (the author of the published book titled Tariqah al-Khilaf fi al-Fiqh). Al- Marghinani writes in the preface of the manuscript that he took a copy of the treatise and run it again with Al-Nasafi for final review. =Quranic sciences= * Al-Taysir fi al-Tafsir () is his most celebrated work in tafsir, which has been published in 15 volumes by Darul Lubab in 2019. The work has been widely cited in other leading tafsir works of the Ottoman period, including in Tafsir Ibn Kamal Pasha of Ibn Kemal, Roh al-Bayan of Ismail Haqqi, and Ruh al-Ma'ani of Mahmud al-Alusi. Among the Persian tafsirs, Kamal al-Din Hussain Wa'ez Kashefi extensively cites Al-Taysir in both of his tafsir works, i.e. Jawaher al-Tafsir and Mawaheb-e 'Aliyya. * Tafsir-e Nasafi () is a Persian translation of the Quran in rhymed prose. It is considered to be the third oldest full translation of Quran in Persian language, and the only translation of Quran in rhymed prose. * Al-Akmal al-Atool fi Tafsir al-Quran () was a voluminous work in tafsir, written prior to Al-Taysir fi al-Tafsir. * Resalah fi al-Khata' fi Qira'at al-Qur'an () or Zillah al-Qari (), published in 2017 by Dar 'Amar. =Jurisprudence= * Manzumah fi al-Khilafyat () is a book in the form of poetry, consisting of 2669 verses, explaining the differences in the views of Abu Hanifa and his students, namely Abu Yusuf, Muhammad al-Shaybani and Zufur, on legal rules, as well as the differences between Abu Hanifa and Al-Shafii and Malik ibn Anas. The book was published in 2010 Beirut. :Over ten commentaries have been written on this work, the most celebrated one being that of Abu al-Barakat al-Nasafi titled Al-Muasaffa, published in 2020 by Dar al-Noor. * Hasr al-Masa'il wa Qasr al-Dala'il () is a commentary on Manzumah fi al-Khilafyat with detailed exposition of the reasons (adillah) for each legal rule. The book is published by Dar al-Fajr in 2020. * Tilbah al-Talabah fi al-Istilahat al-Fiqhiyya () is an acclaimed textbook used over centuries in Hanafi schools and has been published multiple times in recent years. * Manzumah al-Jame' al-Saghir () in which Al-Nasafi turned Muhammad Shaibani's seminal work (Al-Jame' Al-Saghir) into poetry consisting of 81 verses. * Shahr al-Usul () - a commentary on Al-Karkhi's seminal work in Usul al-Din. =Biographical history= * Al-Qand fi Zikr 'Ulama'e Samarqand () is a biographical encyclopedia of Transoxiana's Islamic scholars.

Early life and education Adolf Wamper was born in Grevenberg in what is now the town of W√ºrselen, one of five sons raised by their mother, Anna Maria, after their father, Franz Josef Wamper, died in a mining accident in 1907. He was raised Roman Catholic. After finishing school he trained in business and went to work for the Eschweiler Bergwerks-Verein, a leading coal producer. He studied drawing and in 1923 enrolled in the Handwerker- und Kunstgewerbeschule, a school of applied arts in Aachen. He also attended classes for two years at the Aachen Technical University, now RWTH Aachen University.

Through an acquaintance, Hermann Schardt, who became director there, he was appointed head of the sculpture department at Folkwang University of the Arts in late 1948; he continued to work there until 1970. After the war his work moved away from the monumental, but remained rooted in figurative realism. He created numerous public works, including many for schools, a 1952 relief for the district administration building in Euskirchen, and the Angel of the Flames in front of the town hall in D√ºren, commemorating the bombing of 16 November 1944.

Description Adult C. yosemitensis reach lengths of up to and up to 80 body segments. The species is characterized by a broad yellow or orange dorsal band that extends from the collum (first body segment) to the telson, with a bold black stripe down the middle of the band. The base body color is black. The simple eyes (ocelli) are arranged in patches on each side of the head, each patch consists of four rows of ocelli. Distribution C. yosemitensis occurs from extreme southwest Oregon to Kern County, California, with populations in the Warner Mountains, Cascade Range, and Sierra Nevada. It is the most widespread species of Californiulus and is common throughout its range. Ecology C. yosemitensis is found under logs in relatively dry habitats, and is occasionally in moist habitats. In certain parts of Yosemite National Park C. yosemitensis co-occurs with Paeromopus paniculus, a larger member of the family Paeromopodidae. Discovery C. yosemitensis was described by biologist Ralph Vary Chamberlin in 1941. The holotype specimen was collected in Yosemite in 1931 and is stored in the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.

Lahiri was also associated with Network of Asia Pacific Youth as a coordinator for policy research and international advocacy. Biography Agniva Lahiri was born on 22 August 1979, biologically a male, to a government servant and an economics school teacher, as the youngest of their three children, in Kolkata, India. Lahiri's early schooling was in Ramakrishna Mission Residential School and graduate studies at Asutosh College, Kolkata. Subsequently, Lahiri took master's degree in Bengali Literature from University of Calcutta and another master's degree in Sociology from Nagarjuna University, Kolkata and is pursuing higher studies at University of Melbourne. The realization that feminine emotions ruled within a biologically male body came to Lahiri at a very early age. This drew a lot of criticism from Lahiri's teachers and fellow students. But the discriminatory treatments did not stop Lahiri from making the decision to accept oneself as the other gender. Lahiri died on 20 September 2016, reportedly due to liver failure. Social activism Agniva Lahiri's social career started with joining a forum called Pratyay, a division of Praajak, a gay support forum started in 1992 on Kolkata. Lahiri also started a newsletter called Pratyay Arshi Nagar, with contributions even from the college faculty. The newsletter later grew to be a newspaper by name, Manashi. Lahiri's social activism was kickstarted by an incident on 7 December 2003, with the assault by a group of people. Lahiri filed a complaint with the local police who declined to register a formal case against the perpetrators. Lahiri and colleagues persisted and were successful in getting a First Information Report filed. Lahiri has been involved with the Network of Asia Pacific Youth as a coordinator in the research on sexual culture and its relevance in the area of HIV intervention and prevention program. Lahiri's past associations are with UNICEF ROSA in 2002 on Child welfare, with Gender and AIDS Training Institute (GATI). and with UNFPA as a young researcher.

Holland was known nationally, not only as a musician but also as a civil rights activist who worked in the same national circles as Frederick Douglass. His goal was to develop his personal growth, in order to stand as an example for others to see. As a teacher, he deliberately chose a \\"cautious and circumspect\\" bearing, keeping his relationships with students strictly professional. He chose work that was considered honorable and held high standards, and the professional respect that accompanied his position aided his civil rights goals. A measure of his success in showcasing the admirable African American to the world came after he died, when he was given eulogies, by white people as well as African Americans, about his skill as a musician and his personal character.  Background  Holland grew up in Norfolk County, Virginia, the son of a farmer, Exum Holland. He showed talent for music while he was young, writing music to go with pre-existing lyrics, but there were few opportunities to hear music or learn to play where he lived. His chief opportunity was at church. When he was 14 years old in 1833 his parents both died, and he left home for Boston. He then moved on to the nearby town of Chelsea, Massachusetts, staying there for several years. In Boston he met Signor Mariano Perez, a Spanish musician and \\"clever performer on the guitar.\\" Perez taught Holland to play guitar. Another music teacher for Holland was Simon Knabel, a member of Ned Kendall's Brass Band. Knabel had some success arranging music. Holland also studied under William Schubert, also of Kendall's band. Schubert was a \\"brilliant performer on the guitar\\" and Holland made good progress on his instrument. Another teacher, a Scottishman named Pollock, taught him how to play the concert flute. Being young and not living with parents, Holland had to work as a laborer to support himself while he learned his craft. The work was hard, the education took money, and he gave up sleep in order to have time to practice.  College and career  In 1841 (about age 20) he entered Oberlin College in northern Ohio. He stayed there for two years. Afterward, he traveled to Mexico in order to learn Spanish. He wanted to know more about Spanish guitar and the methods of Fernando Sor, Dionisio Aguado y Garc√≠a and others, and needed to be able to understand Spanish to read their works. Holland returned to Oberlin in 1845, married, and moved to Cleveland, Ohio, becoming \\"The first black professional in Cleveland.\\" Holland had at least two children. His daughter Clara Monteith Holland was an accomplished pianist and guitarist. Justin Minor Holland, Jr. also a guitarist, was a teacher, composer and the author of Method for the Guitar, published in 1888. In Cleveland he gave guitar lessons and found a demand for his services. He settled then and devoted himself to teaching and arranging music for the guitar. He became known nationally for his arrangements, which were issued in collections of approximately 20 pieces, including Winter Evenings, Gems for the Guitar, Boquet of Melodies, and Flowers of Melody. He also arranged about 30 duos for two guitars and another 30 for guitar and violin. It was his music method books that gave him his fame as \\"one of America's most influential guitar pedagogues.\\" Holland taught with a conservative approach, looking to European guitar masters and their traditional techniques. His method books were Modern Method for the Guitar (1874) and Comprehensive Method for the Guitar (1876).  Civil rights  Holland was born to free black parents in Norfolk County, Virginia, in 1819. The area had adopted a liberal attitude toward African Americans, which had resulted in a large number being free. That attitude was changing, however, as the demand for labor for producing cotton grew stronger. Slavery was becoming based on the concept of racial inferiority, and the presence of successful, free African Americans contradicted this. Also, the presence of free Blacks showed slaves that freedom was possible. Starting with himself, Holland would work all his life, working to better the conditions for African Americans. He attended a college, Oberlin College, at a time when very few African Americans could get a college education. He studied languages, learning Spanish, French, Italian and German.Justin Holland (1819‚Äì1887) As an adult, between 1848 and 1854, he acted as an assistant secretary and member of council at National and State Negro Conventions. He was secretary of the \\"Colored Americans of Cleveland\\". He worked with the Underground Railroad. He also worked toward establishing a free-black colony in South America, acting as secretary for the Central American Land Company. In 1845 he moved to the Cleveland, Ohio, in the Western Reserve, where he worked on his dream of complete acceptance for African Americans by white Americans, with complete equality. Cleveland was another place where white people were sympathetic toward African Americans. He saw the area as a place that gave him the opportunity to work toward that goal. He consciously embraced education and assimilation as the best ways to overcome racial barriers and prejudices. He looked to European culture as a source of admirable standards (and hoped that middle-class Americans around him would associate him with those standards as well.) He spoke of his own music in terms of European excellence, teaching the \\"correct system\\" to fret the strings on the guitar, as done by \\"the best Masters of Europe.\\" He also wrote a 324-page treatise on subjects of moral reform. Not only working on himself, he tried to help other black people, assisting with the Underground Railroad. When the free masons would not accept African Americans into their society, or recognize the free-black Prince Hall Masons, he corresponded with masonry groups in Europe, seeking support and recognition there. He gained recognitions from Masons in several European countries (Germany, France, Italy, Hungary) and two from the Americas (Peru and the Dominican Republic). Works S.

Founded in 1810, the company is best known for its range of services for people aged 50 and over. SunLife offers over 50s life insurance, equity release, funeral plans and home insurance in the United Kingdom. In 1900, they became the first company to offer life insurance without a medical. SunLife has been part of the Phoenix Group since 2016. SunLife is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and their qualifying products are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The company is a member of the Data & Marketing Association. Their partners are also members of the Equity Release Council (Age Partnership) and the Funeral Planning Authority (Dignity Funerals).  History  = 1800 to 1900 = SunLife can trace its history back to the establishment of the Sun Life Assurance Society on 28 March 1810, when the Sun Fire Office Board launched a separate company to offer life assurance. The society's first office opened opposite the Bank of England in London, and actuary Joshua Milne was appointed the first member of staff. During its first 12 months, Sun Life Assurance Society wrote 132 policies for a total sum assured of ¬£163,150. The premium income was ¬£6,077. At an 1815 board meeting it was decided that, for the future, burial as well as death certificates would be required to substantiate claims. In 1835, the Society appointed its first Medical Officer to assist in the selection of lives for Assurance. Dr Henry Herbert Southey had previously been a Physician-in-Ordinary to the Monarch in 1823, and later Physician-Extraordinary for Queen Adelaide. Amongst the life assurance candidates was Charles Dickens in 1838, who‚Äôs application was declined by the Society on the grounds that he ‚Äúworks too much‚Äù. The first Sun Fire Office salesman, Edward Trescott Liddell, was hired in 1865. 1884 became a landmark year as Sun Life Assurance Society issued more than 1000 policies for the first time. In 1891, the company set up the Sun Life Assurance Company of India, with offices at 7 Council House Street, Calcutta, and a local Board of Directors. Harris Saunders was the Actuary and General Manager. Sun Life Assurance Society bought over twenty life insurance societies during the late 19th and early 20th century and incorporated them, their branch offices and employees into the business. = 1900 to 2000 = Sun Life Assurance Society‚Äôs first monthly premium plan was introduced in 1900. Towards the end of that year, they became the first company in the industry to offer life assurance without a medical examination. In 1921, the non-medical scheme was finalised, meaning approved people aged 50 or over could get immediate whole of life cover without the need for a medical examination. In the years leading up to the Second World War, Sun Life Assurance Society owned East Hall, a house in the outskirts of Orpington. In 1938, it was made into a Southern Divisional Centre in preparation for the war. In 1965, the 155 years of close association between Sun Life and the Sun Fire Office came to an end. The break was a result of the formation of the Sun Alliance and London Group. When Sun Alliance made a successful bid for London Assurance, it resulted in a conflict of interest with Sun Life, so it was agreed that they would go their separate ways. From the 1970s SunLife split their headquarters between London and Bristol.Sun Life Colin Marriner Accessed 4 June 2014 The head office moved to Bristol in 1976-1977. Within a year, Sun Life began sending out direct mail. They introduced their very first plan for people aged over 50 in 1979. In 1982, they became the world‚Äôs first life assurance company to announce a ¬£200,000 non-medical limit. In 1992, French insurer UAP became Sun Life Assurance Society's major shareholder. Shortly after, Sun Life Assurance Society & Provincial Insurance Company merged and established the holding company, Sun Life & Provincial Holdings. In 1997 Axa, who had acquired UAP in 1996, transferred its Equity & Law business to Sun Life & Provincial Holdings increasing its holding in the company from 60% to 72%. = 2000 to present = In May 2000, Axa acquired all shares it did not already own in the company. The business was renamed Axa Sun Life Direct, and then Sun Life Direct in 2009. Axa sold its main life assurance business to Resolution Group in 2010 and continued to sell life insurance products through Sun Life Direct. Dean Lamble, formerly of Aviva, was appointed Managing Director. He was named CEO in 2016. Sun Life Direct rebranded to SunLife in 2014. In the same year, SunLife announced a range of savings products, including stocks and shares ISAs. In 2016, Axa sold its UK investment, pensions and insurance businesses, including SunLife, to UK insurer Phoenix Group in a ¬£375 million deal.  Business activities  = Over 50s life insurance = SunLife offers a whole- of-life insurance plan called the Guaranteed Over 50 Plan.

The 2020 Cost of Dying report indicates that the average cost of a basic funeral in the UK has increased by 3.4% since 2019 to ¬£4,417. = Ageism = SunLife‚Äôs first ageism report, Ageist Britain?, was released in 2019. The report aims to shine a light on the issue of casual ageism and the impact it has on all of us, and to challenge outdated perceptions of what it means to be over 50. = Finances After 50 = In 2019, SunLife commissioned its Finances After 50 report, which looks at what people aged 50+ in the UK do with their money, and the link between what they buy or save and their relative happiness. The report reveals that a third of people aged over 50 in the UK have no private pension. It also discusses financial planning and explores how some over 50s are gaining extra income. = Other research = In 2020, as part of their ongoing research on life after 50, SunLife released the top bucket list choices for people over 50. Some of the most popular choices were holidaying in Australia, buying a new house, skydiving and meeting the Queen, as well as self-improvement goals such as quitting smoking and getting fit.  Brand and image  = The logo = A Sun Fire Office insurance mark The SunLife logo originates from the fire insurance marks that were utilised within the UK from the late seventeenth century to the beginning of the twentieth. These plaques were displayed on the insured buildings and indicated the organisation with whom they were insured.

Chemistry Palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 (Pal-Lys-Thr-Thr-Lys-Ser = Pal-KTTKS) contains 5 amino acids linked to a 16-carbon aliphatic chain for improving the penetration of the molecule through the lipid structures of the skin. It is a matrikine. Matrikines are messenger peptides capable of regulating cell activities by interacting with their specific receptors. They activate certain genes involved in the process of extracellular matrix renewal and cell proliferation. By activating the neosynthesis of extracellular matrix macromolecules, palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 provides an anti-wrinkle effect.

It was remastered and re-released on CD as Pink World [Definitive Edition] on the Renaissance Records label in 2008. Pink World is also the title of the album's promotional music video. The video features two songs from the album. (The title track is not included in the video.) Planet P Project is a pseudonym used by American rock musician and producer Tony Carey (born Anthony Lawrence Carey on October 16, 1953) for his more experimental recordings. Pink World is Carey's fifth solo studio album under his name or his Planet P Project pseudonym. Carey performed all vocals and nearly all instruments on the album, and he composed all of the songs. The album tells the story of a dystopian society sheltered from nuclear annihilation by the Zone, a protected area created through the psychic powers of a seven-year-old boy named Artemus. The boy is manipulated by government officials into acting as a figurehead to gain public support for their rule, though Artemus himself has nearly absolute power over everybody in the Zone. Artemus eventually leaves the area of safety he created, causing it to vanish as he departs. Pink World was a success among the critics, though sales were initially modest. However, the album has achieved a cult following. Background Planet P Project is a pseudonym used by rock musician Tony Carey to distinguish his more progressive and experimental music from his pop-oriented rock releases. In 1982, Carey released his first two solo albums, In the Absence of the Cat, on the indie label X-Records, and I Won't Be Home Tonight, on the Rocshire label, along with the single (and music video) \\"West Coast Summer Nights\\". The title track of the second album was also released as a single. Upon the demise of the Rocshire label, Carey signed with Geffen Records for his third solo album, but he had a great deal of music written that didn't fit the style of that album. He signed a second contract with Geffen to record and release that material under the \\"Planet P Project\\" pseudonym. He released his first album under the name Planet P Project in 1983, called Planet P (later titled Planet P Project) and the first popular single under the Planet P Project name, \\"Why Me\\", which reached #64 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and #4 in the magazine's Top Rock Tracks chart. The single and its video made an impact on MTV during its formative years. (The song was one of 30 songs to be included in the 1995 MTV compilation album MTV Class of 1983.) Planet P Project had become a successful recording act independent of Tony Carey's self-named releases. In 1983 and 1984, Carey recorded his third solo album, Some Tough City, and his second Planet P Project album, the double LP rock opera Pink World, in Hotline Studios, which he co-owned with producer Peter Hauke. A dispute with the label arose when, according to Carey, Geffen's representative was not satisfied with the lyrics to \\"A Fine, Fine Day\\" and \\"The First Day of Summer\\", both of which would later be released as singles from the album Some Tough City, and Carey refused to rewrite them. Relations with Geffen deteriorated further when Carey delivered the finished Pink World album, which was not well received by the label. Carey had this to say about the response from Geffen: :I delivered Pink World, and the shit REALLY hit the fan. Some of the comments that filtered back to me were \\"unreleasable\\" and \\"this kid's crazy.\\" And some bad ones, too. Long story short, I got traded like a baseball player to MCA Records, which went ahead and released both of these records. MCA released Some Tough City in the spring of 1984, along with two top 40 singles from the album, and Carey and the label decided to delay the release of Pink World until later that year to avoid interfering with sales and airplay of the earlier album by releasing competing material. =Promotional video= A single promotional music video combining the two Pink World songs \\"What I See\\" and \\"Behind the Barrier\\" was produced by MGMM Productions. The video, simply titled Pink World, was directed by Roger Lyons, who had previously directed six other music videos, including \\"Every Man Has a Woman Who Loves Him\\" by Yoko Ono and John Lennon, and worked with Ridley Scott as assistant director in Apple Computer's famous 1984 television advertisement. Along with art director Steve Addison, Lyons created a video that Frank Lovece from Faces described as looking \\"far less like rock clips and more like surrealist paintings come to life,\\" and they did so on a budget of under ¬£40,000 UK (1984, not corrected for inflation). They achieved this in part by filming the entire video on 16 mm film instead of the standard 35 mm film. In describing his vision for the video, Lyons said, \\"My inspiration was pictorial...what I saw mostly was sort of everybody's nightmare, with a lot of my own background.\\" Lovece points out that this extended to Lyons' decision to cast his own mother and father in the two parental roles. At the time of the video's production, Carey was negotiating for financing to have Pink World made into a feature film, but the film never materialized. Plot =Album= The album tells a dystopian story of a group of people who were sheltered from nuclear attack in an area called the Zone, which itself was created through the psychic powers of a speechless seven-year-old boy named Artemus (spelled both \\"Artemus\\" and \\"Artemis\\" in the lyrics in the CD booklet), or Artie. These supernatural powers came to the boy following exposure to polluted water in a lifeless river, which flows past a factory that makes household goods. In addition to gaining numerous psychic powers, including psychokinesis and clairvoyance, the boy is condemned to live forever, and he prevents any of the inhabitants of the Zone from aging physically. Artemus is held by officials of an unnamed government who fear his powers yet want to use them militarily. As part of this plan, they persuade him to construct the Zone, and they present him to the people as an inspiring nationalistic symbol. Once the Zone is completed, the government launches a first strike nuclear attack against an unnamed foe. From that point on, life for the survivors in the Zone becomes distinctly Orwellian, revolving around the will of the omnipresent Artemus, who is accepted by the people as a benevolent messianic figure. The boy can read the thoughts of anyone in the Zone, and the people find that comforting. He has absolute power, though he is influenced by flattery to enforce the will of the government officials. Throughout much of the story, Artemus is confused and unsure of what he should do, which adds to his vulnerability to official leadership. The story concludes with Artemus vanishing from the Zone, leaving behind only a \\"little pink pool\\" and a basket at the orphanage, a \\"baby at the door.\\" The barriers enclosing the Zone begin to fade, and the fearful inhabitants realize they no longer need him. Many items in the plot, including Artemus' departure from the Zone, are treated with ambiguity and metaphor. Tony Carey has declined to offer specifics: :I'm not going to tell you what it's about - that's for YOU to figure out. (I've gotten a kick out of all the well-meaning interpretations I've read.) =Music video= The Pink World music video does not adhere strictly to the plot of the album. The video begins with Pink World's main character, Artemus, shown in his bedroom, looking out the window at a helicopter that follows him throughout the first half of the video. He is then shown holding a small globe that is glowing red. His mother enters and puts the globe under his bed and tucks him in. With the helicopter following him, the scene changes to a large institutional setting filled with empty beds. He appears sad and confused as his mother washes him. He sees a vision of crowds of people in the Barrier (foreshadowing the scene in the second part of the video). The first part of the video ends as we see Artemus again looking out of his bedroom window, the institution and the crowds in the Barrier apparently a vision. He climbs back into bed. The plot in the first part of the video is not linear. Scenes are interspersed with flashbacks and future visions. As the music transitions from \\"What I see\\" to \\"Behind the Barrier\\", Artemus is shown emerging from the cage section of \\"The Healer\\" (\\"Le Th√©rapeute\\", a figure appearing in many works by Belgian surrealist artist Ren√© Magritte, e.g., ref) He then finds himself in a surreal scene populated with what Lovece describes as \\"ragged waifs\\" crowded into the tall Barrier that encloses the Zone, with skeleton soldiers patrolling the ground. Artemus witnesses three identical girls emerging from a shell, one at a time, apparently having been cloned. He then sees himself emerging as a clone from a similar shell, and he grins at himself. (No such episode is described in the album's lyrics. This is one of several instances of artistic license employed by the video's director, Roger Lyons.) The video ends with Artemus shown content among the masses of \\"ragged waifs\\" gathered within the Barrier. Release MCA's original double LP version of Pink World was released in late November, 1984. The album was simultaneously released in the US and Europe. The double LP was pressed on what one reviewer called ‚ÄúPepto Bismol pink vinyl.‚Äù The single for \\"What I See\\" was also released on pink vinyl, as was the 12\\" promotional single distributed to radio stations for airplay. MCA also released the album on cassette.This was the last album Tony Carey released under the name Planet P Project until 2005, when he released Go Out Dancing Part 1 \\"1931\\". The Pink World video was released at the same time, and it immediately went into power rotation on MTV. =Reception= Pink World entered the Billboard 200 album chart on December 1, 1984, peaking at #121 on February 2, 1985. It was selected as a pick by Billboard in their December 15, 1984 issue. The accompanying review referred to the album as a \\"thematic extravaganza\\" with \\"plenty of dramatic rock arrangements.\\" Pink World spent a total of 14 weeks in the Billboard 200, with its last appearance in the March 2, 1985 chart. The song \\"What I See\\" reached #25 on Billboard's Top Rock Tracks chart on December 29 of 1984, though the single, \\"What I See\\" (b/w \\"Behind the Barrier\\"), did not reach the Billboard Hot 100 chart, despite Billboard endorsing it as a recommended pop single in their February 2, 1985 issue.All content under this subheading is sourced from Billboard, all issues from December 1, 1984 (volume 96, issue 48), through March 2, 1985 (volume 97, issue 9). All information comes from the print issues of Billboard, as scanned and maintained on the Billboard website at http://www.billboard.com/magazine- archive. The Pink World video entered power rotation on MTV during the week ending December 1, 1984. The video remained in power rotation or active rotation for ten weeks on the network. The Campus Network also aired the Pink World video during their New Groove show. =Continued popularity= Although sales of the album were modest when it was released, Pink World continues to enjoy popularity with fans of the progressive rock genre. Tom Demalon of AllMusic rates the album at 4 1/2 stars out of five. Demalon writes, \\"Pink World is a curiously interesting work that has managed to achieve a certain cult status.\\" Sam Fiorani from The High Fidelity Report, in a 2013 review of the albums Planet P Project and Pink World, described both albums as \\"the best-kept secrets hidden away in the stacks of vinyl across the country.\\" Summarizing opinions found around the Internet, Fiorani says \\"'It would make a good SciFi movie' and 'make no mistake, Pink World is a phenomenal album' are types of comments on the ‚ÄòNet by fans of this set.\\" He concludes his review with the recommendation, \\"Give yourself a treat and find your own copies of Planet P and Pink World for a glimpse of a time long gone by and great music that may never return.\\" The \\"producer\\" Peter Hauke, a producer who had worked with heavy metal band White Lion, was also credited as the producer in the MCA editions of Pink World, as well as Carey's first three studio albums and the previous Planet P Project. However, in the liner notes for the 2008 remastered edition CD, Carey does not name Hauke, but harshly criticizes him as someone who made no artistic contribution to the recording (confirmed by technicians working on this project). He writes, :\\"The 'producer' was quite talented - at making deals and money - all of which he kept for himself.\\" Hauke is not credited as the producer in the liner notes, CD booklet, or on the disc itself in the 2008 release. He is not referred to by name in the liner notes. He is only referred to as the \\"producer\\", always in quotation marks. He is named on the back cover of the CD booklet as a co-arranger.

A .map accompanies a .ped file and provides information about variants, while .bim and .fam files accompany .bed files as part of the binary dataset. Additionally, PLINK accepts inputs of VCF, BCF, Oxford, and 23andMe files, which are typically extracted into the binary .bed format prior to performing desired analyses. With certain formats such as VCF, some information such as phase and dosage will be discarded. PLINK has a variety of output files depending on the analysis. PLINK has the ability to output files for BEAGLE and can recode a .bed file into a VCF for analyses in other programs. Additionally, PLINK is designed to work in conjunction with R, and can output files to be processed by certain R packages.

She is best known for her work on Harry the Dirty Dog (1956) and other books in the Harry series written by her then husband Gene Zion. Early life Graham was born in Toronto. Her father, Malcolm Robert Graham, was a physician and her mother Florence (n√©e Bloy) was a nurse. When Graham was one, the family moved to Sandwich, Ontario (now part of Windsor), where her father became the superintendent of the sanatorium. Her childhood was spent in Ontario, but she spent her summer holidays abroad, either with her grandfather in England or an aunt in the United States. The family returned to Toronto when she was ten. She attended Saturday morning classes at the Art Gallery of Ontario. Graham majored in art history at the University of Toronto, graduating in 1943. After graduation, she attended a summer course at the venerable Art Students League in New York City. She later supplemented her studies at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University and also the New School for Social Research. She decided to stay in New York to establish a career as a commercial artist. From 1944 to 1945 she worked as a ship draftsman for Gibbs & Cox and in 1946 she started work in the art department of Cond√© Nast Publications, where she remained until 1956. Writer and illustrator Graham met her first husband Gene Zion (1913-1975) at Cond√© Nast. They were married in July 1948. Zion was urged by his new wife and also his editor, Ursula Nordstrom of Harper and Brothers, to write children's books. He remembers that it was Graham‚Äôs sketch of children gathering apples in an orchard, done several years earlier in Canada, that inspired his first book, All Falling Down (1951). The husband- and-wife team became famous for the Harry series of books, beginning with Harry the Dirty Dog (1956) and followed by No Roses for Harry! (1958), Harry and the Lady Next Door (1960) and Harry By the Sea (1965). The collaboration ended with their divorce in 1968. Graham received two Caldecott Honors, one for her work on All Falling Down, the second for her work on The Storm Book. Graham launched her own writing career around the time of the divorce with Be Nice to Spiders (1967). She later developed her own canine hero, Benjy, through a series of books. Later life Graham was remarried in 1972 to a merchant-ship officer, Oliver W. Holmes, Jr. She lived in retirement in Cambridge, Massachusetts. =Major works= =Author and Illustrator= {| class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" !scope=\\"col\\"|Title !scope=\\"col\\"|Year !scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" | Publisher |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| Be Nice To Spiders | 1967 | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| Benjy and the Barking Bird | 1971 | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| Benjy‚Äôs Dog House | 1973 | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| Benjy‚Äôs Boat Trip | 1977 | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| Benjy and His Friend Fifi | 1988 | HarperCollins |} =Illustrator= {| class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" !scope=\\"col\\"|Title !scope=\\"col\\"|Year !scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" | Author !scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" | Publisher |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| All Falling Down | 1951 | Zion G. | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| The Storm Book | 1952 | Zolotow C. | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| Hide and Seek Day | 1954 | Zion G. | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| The Summer Snowman | 1955 | Zion G. | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| Harry the Dirty Dog | 1956 | Zion G. | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| Really Spring | 1956 | Zion G. | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| Dear Garbage Man | 1957 | Zion G. | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| Jeffie's Party | 1957 | Zion G. | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| No Roses for Harry | 1958 | Zion G. | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| The Plant Sitter | 1959 | Zion G. | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| Harry and the Lady Next Door | 1960 | Zion G. | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| The Meanest Squirrel I Ever Met | 1963 | Zion G. | Scribners |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| The Sugar Mouse Cake | 1964 | Young M.B. | Scribners |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| Harry by the sea | 1965 | Zion G. | HarperCollins |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| The Green Hornet Lunchbox | 1970 |Shirley Gordon | Houghton Mifflin |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| The Pack Rat‚Äôs Day and Other Poems | 1974 | Prelutsky J. | Macmillan |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| What if? | 1987 | Minarik E.H | Greenwillow |- ! scope=\\"row\\"| It‚Äôs spring! | 1989 | Minarik E.H | Greenwillow |} References Biographical sources *Commire, A.

Since 2010, he has been professor of archaeology and paleogenetics at the University of T√ºbingen. In 2014, Krause was named co- director of the new Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena.  Career  From 2000 to 2005, Krause studied biochemistry in Leipzig and at the University College Cork in Ireland. In 2005 he obtained his diploma with the publication The mitochondrial genome of the woolly mammoth at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, followed by a doctoral dissertation in 2008 under Svante P√§√§bo entitled From genes to genomes: Applications for multiplex PCR in Ancient DNA Research regarding genetic investigations into Neanderthals and cave bears.Michael Bolus: Laudatio: Dr. Johannes Krause, Preistr√§ger des zw√∂lften T√ºbinger F√∂rderpreises f√ºr √Ñltere Urgeschichte und Quart√§r√∂kologie (pdf; 155 kB), In: Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft f√ºr Urgeschichte, Band 19, 2010, S. 7‚Äì10. In 2010, for his doctoral thesis he was awarded the T√ºbingen Award for Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology. The same year, for his co-authorship of the Science article A draft sequence and preliminary analysis of the Neandertal genome he received the Newcomb Cleveland Prize of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the prize for the best article of the year. In October 2010, he became a junior professor at the Institute of Scientific Archaeology in T√ºbingen. Since then he has headed the working group on paleogenetics at the Institute. In the summer of 2014, it was announced that the Max Planck Institute of Economics in Jena would receive a different mandate. Along with Russell Gray, Krause was appointed co-director of a new Max Planck Institute of History and the Sciences, starting February 1, 2014. At the same time Krause remains an Honorary Professor at the University of T√ºbingen.  Research  Krause's focus is genetic analysis using DNA sequencing. His research interests include human evolution and historical pathogens and epidemics. In 2010, Krause and others successfully reconstructed the mitochondrial DNA of a Denisovan individual from 30 milligrams of powdered material from a finger bone. This enabled him to demonstrate that the Denisovans represented an independent branch of the genus Homo which diverged from the Neanderthal lineage 640,000 years ago. He also contributed to research in the genetic heritage of Neanderthals, which demonstrated that Neanderthals and modern humans share the same \\"language gene\\" (FOXP2) which suggests Neanderthals also had the capacity to speak. Krause was part of the international research team which in 2011 reconstructed the genome of the bacterium Yersinia pestis from DNA samples extracted from the 14th-century East Smithfield plague cemetery in London, establishing definitive proof that the medieval Black Death epidemic was caused by Y. pestis. In June 2013, Krause's group in collaboration with the Institute of Technology Lausanne published research showing that the leprosy bacterium has not changed genetically since the Middle Ages and all leprosy bacteria can be attributed worldwide to a common ancestor dating to 4000 BC. In 2017, a team lead by Krause performed the first reliable sequencing of the genomes of mummified individuals from Ancient Egypt. However, by the team's own admission in the manuscript, the samples may not have been representative of the majority of Egyptians, especially dynasties predating invasions by Eurasians. Previous haplotype and PCR DNA findings indicated Sub-Saharan African origin. Their study looked at 90 individuals and revealed that they \\"closely resembled ancient and modern Near Eastern populations, especially those in the Levant, and had almost no DNA from sub-Saharan Africa. What's more, the genetics of the mummies remained remarkably consistent even as different powers‚Äîincluding Nubians, Greeks, and Romans‚Äîconquered the empire.

He also oversaw the translation of the Tibetan Buddhist canon into Classical Mongolian and Manchu. He also was involved in the compilation of a quadralingual set (Chinese, Manchurian, Mongolian and Tibetan) and supervised the translation from Chinese into Manchurian, Mongolian and Tibetan of the entire ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra completed in 1763; the Tibetan translation is currently preserved in a supplement to the Narthang Kangyur.Even though von Sta√´l‚ÄìHolstein call this tripitaka the Narthang Kanjur, I believed it is known as the Peking (Beijing) Kangyur in today‚Äôs usage. The early print editions of the Peking Kangyur were printed in vermilion ink. Later printings and any supplements would have been printed in black ink. Cf. Biography =Birth and early education= Changkya R√∂lp√© Dorj√© was born on the 10th day of the fourth (Hor) month of the Fire-Bird year (1717) in Wuwei (formerly known as Liangzhou) near Lanzhou in Gansu.Smith (2001) p.135 At an early age he was recognized by the first Jamyang Zh√©pa as the incarnation of the previous Changkya Kutuktu of G√∂nlung Jampa Ling monastery (‰ΩëÂÆÅÂØ∫) in Amdo (now Qinghai), one of the four great Gelug monasteries of the north. At his investiture the Kangxi Emperor sent Kachen Sh√©rap Dargy√© as his representative. In 1723, soon after the death of Kangxi, the new ruler, Yongzheng (r. 1722-1735) was just establishing his authority, Mongol tribesmen claiming the succession of G√ºshi Khan, together with their Amdo Tibetan allies and supported by some factions within the monasteries, rose up against the Qing in the region of Kokonor. Yongzheng insisted on violent reprisals and in Amdo the Manchu army, destroyed villages and monasteries believed to have sided with the rebels including in 1724 G√∂nlung.Sullivan(2013) p.50Sullivan(2013) p.321 ff However the emperor ordered that the seven-year-old Changkya incarnation not be harmed but brought to China as a \\"guest\\". At the Yongzheng Emperor's court, he was raised and educated to serve as an intermediary between the seat of Manchu power and the Buddhists of Amdo, Tibet and Mongolia. R√∂lp√© Dorj√©'s monastic teachers included Zhangshu Kachen Sh√©rap Dargy√©; the second Thuken Hotogtu, Ngakwang Ch√∂kyi Gyatso and Ats√© Ch√∂j√© Lozang Ch√∂dzin.Smith (2001) p.136 Changkya R√∂lp√© Dorj√© and his teachers realised that in order for the Gelug teachings to flourish in China and Manchuria they would need to be available in Chinese, Mongolian and Manchu and so he began the study of those languages. One of his fellow students was Prince Hungli, who became his friend Bernard (2004)p.124A summary of Changkya‚Äôs and Qianlong‚Äôs relationship can also be found in Chayet, Temples de Jehol, pp.60‚Äì64 ‚Äî and eventually the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735-1796). He also took an interest in Chinese Buddhism and thought that their principle philosophical views had close similarities with those of the Yogachara () school. He was also apparently the one who came up with the notion that Dampa Sangye, the Indian founder of the Pacification () school in Tibet who supposedly also visited China, and Bodhidharma were the same person.Smith (2001) p.137 =Exile of the 7th Dalai Lama= The Third Changkya, Rolpe Dorje In the late 1720s Polhan√© S√∂nam Topgy√© mounted a successful campaign to take control of Tibet and the Seventh Dalai Lama was exiled, leaving Lhasa at the end of 1728. The Manchu ambans in Lhasa, representatives of the Yongzheng emperor, arranged for an invitation to the Pa·πáchen Lama Lozang Y√©sh√© to travel to Lhasa, which he reluctantly did, in October 1728. Polhan√© granted him dominion over most of Tsang and Ngari, forcing him to cede the eastern part of the region to Lhasa. In 1729 after the Panchen Lama sent a letter and numerous gifts to the Yongzheng emperor R√∂lp√© Dorj√© obtained permission from the emperor for his monastery G√∂nlung Jampa Ling to be rebuilt.Sullivan(2013) p. 341 =First Visit to Tibet= In 1732 the Panchen Lama petitioned the Emperor to enable the Seventh Dalai Lama to return to Lhasa. When the petition was granted in 1734 R√∂lp√© Dorj√© was ordered by Yongzheng to accompany the 7th Dalai Lama to Lhasa. This trip gave R√∂lp√© Dorj√© the opportunity to study with the Dalai Lama as well as to make offerings at Lhasa's major monasteries and to present gifts from the emperor. In 1735 Changkya and the Dalai Lama went on to Tashi Lhunpo Monastery in Shigatse to pay his respect to Lobsang Yeshe, 5th Panchen Lama (1663-1737), where he took both his initial and final monastic vows under the Panchen Lama's supervision. When Yongzheng died in 1736, R√∂lp√© Dorj√© had to give up his plans to study under the Panchen Lama and returned to Beijing. Both the Panchen Lama and Dalai Lama offered him religious statues and other significant gifts as parting presents. =Lama of the Qianlong Emperor= 18th-century statue of Rolpe Dorje In 1744, the Qianlong emperor decided to transform the Yonghegong Palace in Beijing into a Gelugpa monastery as well as an Imperial Palace. This became the residence of Changkya and many other important incarnations from Amdo and Mongolia and the centre for the Qing to manage Tibetan Buddhist affairs and control local authorities in Mongolia, Amdo, Tibet and other areas which followed Tibetan Buddhism. In 1744, Qianlong also indicated to R√∂lp√© Dorj√© that he wanted to receive private religious teachings and R√∂lp√© Dorj√© first taught him the commentary on how to take refuge in the three jewels as well instructing him in Tibetan grammar and reading. Later, Qianlong requested teachings on the bodhisattva path and R√∂lp√© Dorj√© taught him the commentary of the Graduated Path (Lam Rim) by Vajradhara Kunchok Gyaltsen, together with a commentary by the previous Changkya, Ngawang Losang Ch√∂den. \\"By studying these two texts, Qianlong developed great faith (gong ma thugs dad gting nas khrungs) and made a commitment to practice daily, which he kept despite his busy schedule\\" Bernard(2004) pp.124-5 In 1745, after R√∂lp√© Dorj√© completed a retreat, the Qianlong emperor asked him for the tantric teachings and empowerment (abhisheka) of his yidam, Chakrasamvara. As the disciple and requester of the abhisheka, the emperor had to gather all the necessary materials and equipment. R√∂lp√© Dorj√© conferred on the emperor abhisheka the five deities Chakrasamvara according to the lineage of the Indian siddha, Ghantapa. During the initiation, R√∂lp√© Dorj√© as vajra master sat on the throne and the emperor knelt to receive the initiation according to the prescriptions for disciples.See: Thu‚Äôu bkwan Chos kyi Nyi ma. lcang skya rol pa‚Äôi rdo rje rnam thar [=The Biography of Lcang skya Rol pa‚Äôi Rdo je]. Quoted in: Illich (2003) p.5 The emperor offered 100 ounces of gold with a mandala (symbolizing the universe) to receive the initiation. After the initiation, Qianlong said to Rolpai Dorje, ‚ÄúNow you are not only my lama, you are my vajra master.‚Äù Bernard(2004) pp.125-6 In 1748, R√∂lp√© Dorj√© made his first trip back to G√∂nlung Jampa Ling, his monastery that he had left as a child, and at his request the monastery was granted an Imperial Plaque which was installed above the entrance to the main assembly hall.Sullivan(2013) pp.341‚Äî348 =Timeline= In 1757, went to Tibet In 1760, returned to China In 1763, Father died Trouble with the B√∂npo in In 1792, Qianlong, who had been the generous patron, friend and dedicated student of R√∂lp√© Dorj√©, sought to assure his Chinese subjects that foreign priests exercised no influence over him. His Pronouncements on Lamas (Lama Shuo) preserved in a tetraglot (Chinese, Manchu, Mongol, and Tibetan) inscription at the Yonghe Temple in Beijing, Qianlong defends his patronage of the \\"Yellow Hat\\" (Gelug) sect from his Chinese critics by claiming that his support had simply been expedient: \\"By patronizing the Yellow Sect we maintain peace among the Mongols. This being an important task we cannot but protect this (religion).

Early life and education He was born in Lydia, South Carolina and initially lived in a house without electricity or running water. He enrolled in Furman University in 1938, where he majored in economics and graduated in 1942. During World War II he served in the U.S. Army Air Corps, mustering out as a First Lieutenant. He then entered the University of Michigan Law School, graduating in 1948. Career He worked for five years in the office of the chief counsel for the Internal Revenue Service. He then worked for Texaco in New York City before moving to Greenville, South Carolina, where he established a private practice as a tax attorney. In 1969 he was appointed an Assistant Attorney General in the Richard Nixon administration. In 1971 Nixon appointed him as Internal Revenue Commissioner, to replace Randolph W. Thrower, who had been fired for resisting attempts by the administration to order tax audits or obtain tax records on Nixon's political opponents. In 1972, three months after the Watergate break-in, Nixon's White House Counsel John Dean gave Walters a list of \\"enemies\\" and told him to order IRS investigations on them. Instead, Walters put the list in an envelope, sealed it, and locked in his safe, after obtaining permission to do nothing from his superior, Secretary of the Treasury George Shultz. Walters later commented, \\"By refusing to implement the request we preserved our tax system and also kept me out of jail.\\" A few months later, after knowledge of the list became public, he turned the still-sealed envelope over to the executive director of the Congressional Joint Tax Committee. After resigning as IRS Commissioner in 1973, Walters practiced law in Richmond, Virginia for five years, then returned to Greenville and joined a law firm there. He retired from law practice at age 77 but continued to do financial consulting until he was 85. In 2011 he published his memoirs, Our Journey. Personal life He married Donna Hall, whom he met on his first day at the University of Michigan. They were married for 66 years and had four children. He died in Greenville at age 94.

The Thread protocol specification is available at no cost, however this requires agreement and continued adherence to an EULA which states that \\"Membership in Thread Group is necessary to implement, practice, and ship Thread technology and Thread Group specifications.\\"Thread 1.1 Specification Membership of the Thread Group is subject to an annual membership fee except for the \\"Academic\\" tier.Thread Group In July 2014, the \\"Thread Group\\" alliance was announced, which is a working group with the companies Nest Labs (a subsidiary of Alphabet/Google), Samsung, ARM Holdings, Qualcomm, NXP Semiconductors/Freescale, Silicon Labs, Big Ass Solutions, Somfy, OSRAM, Tyco International, and the lock company Yale in an attempt to have Thread become the industry standard by providing Thread certification for products. In August 2018 Apple joined the group raising hopes it will help popularize the protocol. Thread uses 6LoWPAN, which in turn uses the IEEE 802.15.4 wireless protocol with mesh communication, as does Zigbee and other systems. Thread however is IP-addressable, with cloud access and AES encryption. A BSD licensed open-source implementation of Thread (called \\"OpenThread\\") has also been released by Nest.OpenThread In 2019, the Connected Home over IP project, led by Zigbee, Google, Amazon and Apple, announced a broad collaboration to create a royalty-free standard and open- source code base to promote interoperability in home connectivity, leveraging Thread as well as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy.  Selling points and key features  As mentioned above, Thread uses 6LoWPAN, which is based on the use of a connecting router, called an edge router (Thread calls their edge routers Border Routers). Unlike other proprietary networks, 6LoWPAN, like any network with edge routers, does not maintain any application layer state because such networks forward datagrams at the network layer. This means that 6LoWPAN remains unaware of application protocols and changes. This lowers the processing power burden on edge routers. It also means that Thread does not need to maintain an application layer. Thread states that multiple application layers can be supported, as long as they are low-bandwidth and are able to operate over IPv6.\\"Thread Stack Fundamentals\\". Thread Group. 2015. Retrieved 1 April 2017 Thread touts that there is no single point of failure in its system. However, if the network is only set up with one edge router, then this can serve as a single point of failure. The edge router or another router can assume the role of Leader for certain functions. If the Leader fails, another router or edge router will take its place. This is the main way that Thread guarantees no single point of failure. Thread promises a high level of security. Only devices that are specifically authenticated can join the network. All communications through the network are secured with a network key.

Formerly an elite Evzone (light infantry) regiment, today its name and tradition are borne by the Recruit Training Centre of Messolonghi (ŒöŒïŒù ŒúŒµœÉŒøŒªŒøŒ≥Œ≥ŒØŒøœÖ).  History  The regiment was formed on 23 December 1913 at Messolonghi, as part of the Hellenic Army's reorganization following the Balkan Wars. The regiment fought in the Macedonian front operations of World War I as part of the 3rd Infantry Division from 25 April 1918 until the war's end in the Prespa Lakes area. Following the Allied breakthrough of the German- Bulgarian front in autumn, the regiment advanced to Pirot. Along with the rest of the division, it was transferred to Smyrna in August 1920, and took part in all subsequent operations of the Asia Minor Campaign until the Greek defeat in 1922. During the Greco-Italian War of 1940‚Äì41, the regiment was part of the 8th Infantry Division and thus one of the first units to face the Italian attack. The regiment served throughout the conflict, being disbanded after the capitulation of the Greek army to the Germans in April 1941. After the end of World War II, on 2 December 1950 a training centre for new recruits (ŒöŒ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒø ŒïŒ∫œÄŒ±ŒØŒ¥ŒµœÖœÉŒ∑œÇ ŒùŒµŒøœÉœÖŒªŒªŒ≠Œ∫œÑœâŒΩ, ŒöŒïŒù) was established at Messolonghi, which on 31 August 1965 received the designation \\"12th Infantry Regiment\\", before being renamed to \\"2/39 Evzone Regiment\\" on 26 June 1978. On 26 September 2000, the regiment received the honorific name \\"Col. Karachristos\\" after its commander, Col. Vlasios Karachristos, killed in action on 20 August 1921. For its wartime service, the regiment had been twice decorated with the highest Greek military distinction, the Commander's Cross of the Cross of Valour, the first time for its actions in the Macedonian Front, and the second for its actions during the spring and summer battles of 1921, especially the two-day battle of Avgin near Bursa in March. The regiment was also awarded the French Croix de guerre 1914‚Äì1918 for its actions on the Macedonian Front. The regiment and the training centre are located in the \\"Lt. Gen.

Built in 1875 for politician (and future Governor of New Hampshire) Benjamin Franklin Prescott, it is the town's finest example of Second Empire architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The Benjamin Franklin Prescott House stands in a rural setting west of the center of Epping, on the east side of Prescott Street south of its junction with Dearborn Street. It is sited prominently facing south at a bend in the road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, covered by a bellcast mansard roof with flared eaves, and sheathed in wooden clapboards. It has paneled cornerboards, paired brackets in the eaves, and a richly detailed front portico. A 1-1/2 story ell extends to the rear of the main block. A period carriage barn is located across Prescott Street; although it has been converted to residential use, it retains Second Empire features similar to those of the house. The house was built in 1875 for Benjamin Franklin Prescott, who was then serving in his second term as New Hampshire's Secretary of State. In 1877 he was elected to the first of two consecutive one-year terms as Governor of New Hampshire. Prescott had risen to prominence in the state as the publisher of a leading antislavery newspaper, and he was a noted local historian, serving as vice-president of the state historical society, and as a fellow of the Royal Historical Society of London. His house was sold out of the family in 1903.

The Old Town Hall was built in 1738 as a colonial meeting house, and served as the community's civic center into the 1940s. It was moved a short distance to its present location adjacent to the common in 1838, the year in which it also ceased housing religious services. It underwent a number of alterations in the 18th and early 19th centuries, including some designed by architect Henry Vaughan in 1899. It housed a municipal court on the upper level from 1961 to 1973, and housed community organization activities until 1981, when it was taken over by the local historical society. In addition to the old town hall, the historic district includes an 1861 district schoolhouse which now serves as a branch library, and a 1906 fire station. The common is the site of a number of war memorials, commemorating the military service of Salem natives in various military conflicts, and the town's original burying ground, which dates to about 1741, the year in which the border was determined.

The two sets of field coils and the rotating sense coil are visible. A Bellini‚ÄìTosi direction finder (B‚ÄìT or BTDF) is a type of radio direction finder (RDF), which determines the direction to, or bearing of, a radio transmitter. Earlier RDF systems used very large rotating loop antennae, which the B‚ÄìT system replaced with two fixed antennae and a small rotating loop, known as a radiogoniometer. This made RDF much more practical, especially on large vehicles like ships or when using very long wavelengths that demand large antennae. BTDF was invented by a pair of Italian officers in the early 1900s, and is sometimes known as a Marconi‚ÄìBellini‚ÄìTosi after they joined forces with the Marconi Company in 1912. BTDF was the most prevalent form of naval direction finding from the 1920s to well into the 1980s, and was used as a major part of early long- distance air navigation systems from the 1930s until after World War II. BTDF systems were also widely used for military signals intelligence gathering. During the war, new techniques like huff-duff began to replace radiogoniometers in the intelligence gathering role, reducing the time needed to take an accurate fix from minutes to seconds. The ability to inexpensively process radio signals using microcontrollers allowed pseudo-doppler direction finders to take over most of the radiogoniometer's remaining roles from the 1980s. In spite of seeing little use today, the original antennae of BTDF systems can still be seen on many ships and boats. History =Early RDF= Early RDF systems used large rotating loop antennae built on wooden frames. This 1919 example, from the National Bureau of Standards, is relatively small for the era. The earliest experiments in RDF were carried out in 1888 when Heinrich Hertz discovered the directionality of an open loop of wire used as an antenna. He noticed that the spark generated at the open gap between the ends of the loop was much stronger when the loop was end-on to the transmitter, and disappeared entirely when it was aligned face-on to the transmitter. By the early 1900s, many experimenters were looking for ways to use this concept for locating the position of a transmitter. Early radio systems generally used longwave or medium wave signals. Longwave, in particular, had good long-distance transmission characteristics due to their limited interaction with the ground, and thereby provided excellent great circle route ground wave propagation that pointed directly to the transmitter. Methods of performing RDF on longwave signals was a major area of research during the 1900s and 1910s. Antennae are generally sensitive to signals only when they have a length that is a significant portion of the wavelength, or larger. A common example is the half-wave dipole. For longwave use, this resulted in loop antennae tens of feet on a side, often with more than one loop connected together to improve the signal. This presented a significant problem in arranging for the antenna to be rotated. The US Navy overcame this problem, to a point, by mounting long antennae on ships and sailing in circles. One solution to this problem was developed by the Marconi company in 1905. This consisted of a number of long horizontal wires or rods arranged to point outward from a common center point. A movable switch could connect opposite pairs of these wires to form a dipole, and by rotating the switch the operator could hunt for the strongest signal. All of these systems were unwieldily and impractical for many uses. =Bellini‚ÄìTosi= The crossed-loops DF antenna atop the mast of a tug boat. These would be used with a B‚ÄìT radiogoniometer for navigation by taking measurements against shore-side transmitters. During experiments in 1907, Ettore Bellini and Alessandro Tosi noticed that they could cause the received signal to be re-radiated by forming a loop with multiple winds of wire. Using two loop antennae arranged at right angles and two sets of these small wire coils arranged the same way, the directional properties of the original radio signal were re-created. Direction finding could then be carried out with a conventional loop antenna placed in the center of these two stators (or field coils); the rotating loop was known as the rotor (or sense coil). Since the field coils were connected to the antennae electrically, they could be placed anywhere, and their size was independent of the wavelength. This meant that RDF could now be performed on longest wavelengths with ease, using antennae of any size. For longwave use, the two crossed antennae could be easily built by running four wires from a single mast to the ground to form triangular shapes. When used with shorter wavelengths, the system of two crossed loop antennae proved to be more mechanically robust than a single rotating one. They had the added advantage that the antennae could be placed almost anywhere; earlier systems often included some sort of remote operation through a mechanical linkage, but this limited the placement of the antenna or receiver room. The pair sold the patents to the Marconi Company in February 1912, and Bellini joined the company to continue development. This was followed almost immediately with test deployments. However, the total signal sent end-to-end was tiny, and the un-amplified system could only be used with powerful signals. Early experiments carried out aboard Eskimo and Royal George, as well as the RMS Mauretania were successful, but the range was limited to about . In testing on the USS Wyoming, the US Navy found that the ship's own magnetism overwhelmed the signal produced from the sense coils, producing an output that suggested the transmitter was always in front of the ship. =Adding amplifiers= The B‚ÄìT system was introduced around the same time as the first triodes, and the Marconi partnership took place in the same year that the triode's ability to amplify signals was first noticed. By 1920, the use of amplifiers in radio was widespread. Triode amplifiers allowed weak signals to be detected at a greater distance. =Adcock antennae= This Japanese BTDF installation at Rabaul was used with signals up to about 2 MHz.The diagonal spacing of the unipoles is 90 feet. During the 1910s and early 1920s a number of researchers discovered that shorter wavelength signals were reflected off what would later be known as the ionosphere. This allowed the signal to hop over very long distances by reflecting multiple times off the ground and ionosphere. This greatly extended range, allowing lower power transmitters to be used for very long-range communications. By 1923 a number of amateur radio operators (hams) demonstrated excellent performance at 100 m and started routine trans-Atlantic communications the next year. This led to a number of new frequency bands being defined in this shortwave region, as short as 10 m (which is very long by today's standards). By 1930 these frequencies were in widespread use for many purposes. Shortwave signals presented a problem for RDF because the skywave signal can be simultaneously received from several different hops, making it appear as if the transmitter is at several different bearings. The solution had already been studied, although not in order to solve this specific problem. In 1917 Frank Adcock was trying to solve the problem of making large antennae suitable for use with the radiogoniometer at even the longest wavelengths. He developed a system using four very tall masts, connected together electrically to form two virtual loops. This eliminated the need to connect the tops of the antennae, which were otherwise difficult to connect together for very large antennae. However, it was later found that the underground connections between the antennae shielded them from skywaves, allowing only the direct-line groundwave to reach the goniometer. =Aviation use= This Marconi B‚ÄìT receiver was used in Australia for the 1934 MacRobertson Air Race. Shorter wavelength bands are particularly useful for aviation use. An antenna that broadcast a useful signal at longwave frequencies would be larger than a typical aircraft (although Zeppelins had no problems) and even higher frequencies in the high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) bands were highly desirable. The limitations of these frequencies to line-of-sight communications during the day was not a serious issue for air-to-ground use, where the local horizon might be hundreds of miles away for an aircraft flying at even moderate altitudes. A good example of the advantages of shorter wavelengths can be seen on the Supermarine Spitfire, which started WWII with an HF radio that broadcast from a cable antenna stretched from the cockpit to the top of the vertical stabilizer. This provided an average air-to-air range of under ideal conditions. These early TR9D sets were replaced by a VHF set using a small whip antenna offering ranges on the order of , and hundreds miles in the air-to-ground mode. By the 1930s the use of BTDF for long-range aircraft navigation was common. A good example of such a system was first installed in Australia in 1934 as part of the MacRobertson Air Race. Two stations equipped with Marconi BTDF sets and Adcock antennae were set up at Charleville and Melbourne. The success of this system led to additional stations being added to form a network of 17 DF stations for long-distance navigation. By 1945, these had been largely replaced by RDF systems in the aircraft, rather than the ground. =Military use= The B‚ÄìT system was also widely used by military forces to determine the location of enemy radio broadcasters. This required some time to perform, often on the order of several minutes for a good fix. This led to various systems to speed the broadcast of messages to make such operations difficult. An example was the German Navy's Kurzsignale code system which condensed messages into short codes, and the fully automated burst encoding Kurier system that sent a Kurzsignale in only ¬Ω a second. =Replacement= The manual Bellini‚ÄìTosi system remained almost universal through WWII except in UK and US service. In the US, a system originally developed by the French ITT laboratories was widely used. The ITT team fled France in front of the German invasion and destroyed their equipment before leaving. They were able to quickly duplicate their efforts once reaching the US. This system used a motor to quickly spin a radiogoniometer, as well as providing an input to electronics that spun the X and Y inputs of a cathode ray tube (CRT). This caused the signal to trace out a pattern on the display that could be used to determine the direction of the transmission almost instantly. In the UK, the high-frequency direction finding (HFDF or ‚Äúhuff-duff‚Äù) system largely had displaced BTDF by about 1943. HFDF used balanced amplifiers that fed directly into a CRT to instantly display the direction directly from the incoming signal, requiring no mechanical movement of any sort. This allowed even the most fleeting signals to be captured and located. The display, in spite of operating on entirely different principles, was very similar to the US mechanical system. HFDF was a closely guarded secret, and did not become well known until after the end of the war. The replacement of ground-based BTDF systems in the aviation role was due primarily to two factors: One was the move to ever-shorter wavelengths, which so shortened the required antennae that RDF could be carried out on a small receive antenna only a few centimetres in length. Since the older, rotating-loop technique was practical at these frequencies, most aircraft used one. The second advance was the introduction of the automatic direction finder (ADF), which completely automated the RDF procedure. Once an ADF system was tuned to a station, either an airway beacon or an AM radio station, they continually moved a pointer to indicate the relative bearing with no further operator involvement. B‚ÄìT, and rotating loops of various sorts, continued to be used in the post-war era by civilians. Improvements continued to be made to both systems throughout this period, especially the introduction of solenoids in place of conventional loops in some roles. However, the introduction of the doppler direction finder, and especially the low-cost electronics to implement it, led to the disappearance of the traditional loop systems by the mid-1990s. Doppler systems use fixed antennae, like BTDF, but handle the direction finding via signal processing alone. Description =Antenna directionality= Radio signals consist of constantly varying electric and magnetic fields arranged at right angles. When the magnetic field passes a metal object, it will cause the electrons in the metal to begin moving synchronously with the signal. According to Faraday's law of induction, this effect is maximized when the object and field are at right angles to each other (alternately, one can think of the electric field being in-line with the object). Although radio signals will propagate in any orientation, for the signals considered here the propagation is strongly attenuated if the magnetic field is not perpendicular to the ground. For this reason, radio antennae, both broadcaster and receiver, are normally vertical. Such signals are said to be vertically polarized. When two or more antennae are placed close together, differences in position of the antennae cause the received radio signal to be seen as differences in phase. For instance, if the two antennae are positioned ¬Ω a wavelength apart, a signal approaching along the line between them will have the opposite phase in the two antennae, causing opposite voltages to be induced. If the signal approaches perpendicular to the line, the phase is the same and the voltages will be equal. If the tops of the antennae are wired together, the net voltage will be zero when the antenna is face-on to the signal, because the voltages in both vertical sections are opposing each other. When the antenna is rotated, the slight difference in phase, and thus induced voltages, will leave a net voltage in the circuit, and current will flow. This is maximized when the antennae are parallel to the transmitter. If one measures the output at all angles as the antennae are rotated with respect to the signal, a figure- eight reception pattern is produced, with a sharp nul point and an extended area of maximum signal. The loop antenna uses this principle in a convenient and mechanically robust form. For vertically polarized signals, reception on the top and bottom of the loop is very low, so it has little contribution or effect on the output. So although the antenna is a complete loop, only the vertical sections have any action on the reception and it acts as two separated antennae. To measure the bearing of a transmitter, the loop is spun about its vertical axis until the signal drops to zero, or nulls, which is a much sharper signal that the maximum. =B‚ÄìT concept= The Bellini‚ÄìTosi system feeds the output voltage of a loop or Adcock antenna into a small coil of wire, the field coil. The varying voltage induced by the received signal causes the wire to re-radiate the same signal. Although as the coil is typically very much smaller than the wavelength and thus has a small antenna factor, the use of many loops of wire in the coil improves the overall signal strength. The total energy radiated by the coil is less than what is received on the antenna, but it broadcasts this into a much smaller physical area, so the flux may be much higher than the original signal. Two antennae and two field coils are used, both arranged at right angles to each other. The area between the two field coils is filled with an analog of the original signal from the antennae. The sense coil, another loop antenna, is placed in the area between the field coils. Rotating the sense coil in the field coils has the same output as rotating the entire loop antenna in the original field. Even slight mis-alignment of the two causes a bias in the output, a false null. Since this was fixed as part of the construction of the radiogoniometer, it was simple enough to correct for this simply by moving the pointer. Slip-rings or nuts were commonly used. =Coupling error= In actual fact, the resulting field in the coils is not an exact analog of the original. It would be if the field coils consisted of a single loop of wire, but as they actually consist of multiple windings, these are, in effect, small solenoids. The resulting field is then strongest at the edges of the windings, falling (ideally) to zero in the center. This causes the output signal to rise and fall around the area in the coils. As the B‚ÄìT system relies on the comparison of signal volumes, this results in a non-uniform output, rising and falling every 45 degrees, eight times around a full circuit. This was known as coupling error or octantal error. The solution to this problem is to wind the sense coil in two pairs, each displaced from either side of the centerline by 22.5 degrees. This makes the error in one coil the opposite of the other, a condition that remains true around the entire circle. The correction is never perfect, the precise angles had to be experimented with on every radiogoniometer. =Antenna tuning= In order to work properly, it is important that both antenna circuits be carefully balanced. To start with the antennae have to be identical, with identical electrical properties in the wiring and the lengths of the leads adjusted to be equal. Since the antennae have inductance and capacitance due to their mechanical layout, additional inductors and capacitors are typically inserted into the circuit so that both antennae have the same totals for both. A common technique to dynamically balance the circuit was to feed an external buzzer signal into the antenna inputs and then tune the capacitors until the signal in both was the same. Even minor changes in the weather, physical layout or even bumping the chassis containing the tunable capacitors can cause the tuning to vary. For this reason a variety of systems were used to decrease the sensitivity of the radiogoniometer to mis- tuning. Primary among these was the aperiodic aerial concept, which described the mechanical layout of the radiogoniometer's internal wiring. By winding the sense coil wiring around a vertical cylinder, and wiring the field coils in a similar arrangement as close as possible to the sense coil, the entire circuit became capacitively coupled. A single tunable capacitor on the output from the sense coil could then be used to tune the entire system. =Sense systems= One drawback to any DF system using loop antennae is that the antenna is equally sensitive on both the front and the back, so there is always a 180 degree ambiguity in the measurements - the transmitter might be on either side of the antenna. To address this, many DF systems added an additional antenna, the sense antenna (unrelated to the sense coil). A sense antenna normally consists of a single vertical antenna positioned some distance from the crossed loops, in line with one of the two loops, at a distance about the same as the distance between the two vertical portions of the loop. The sense antenna's output is mixed with the loop it is in-line with, through a switch that allows it to be turned on or off. When switched on, it produces a voltage that suppresses the output of the rear section of the loop, re-enforcing the forward section. The resulting reception pattern is modified from its original figure-8 to a cardioid. It is also possible to simulate the sense antenna by tapping a feed off the loop it would have been associated with. This is normally accomplished by placing a center tap in the tuning inductor, and then feeding that signal into the circuit as if it were from another antenna. Since the center-tap causes the signal from both vertical sections to be balanced, it creates a signal similar to a single vertical mast. When used with aperiodic windings, the sense circuit has to be wired into the receiver side, along with the tuning capacitor. =Transmission systems= The directional qualities of the radiogoniometer work in both directions; it can be used to determine the direction of an incoming signal, or change the direction of a transmission. During early experiments, this capability was used to produce a radio signal that swept the sky like a lighthouse beam, allowing conventional radio receivers to determine their location by timing the passage of the signal. A typical solution was to broadcast a specific start signal, often Morse code, to start the sweep, and the slowly sweep a steady signal after that. The operator timed from the end of the start signal to the maximum in the continuous tone, and then divided by the rotation rate to determine the angle. The advantage of the B‚ÄìT system in terms of mechanical simplicity was generally difficult to use in this role due to the normally small amount of energy it could tune. Several competing systems were also developed, including omni-directional antennae with motorized wire-mesh reflectors, as well as a Telefunken system that had multiple dipole antennae periodically switched by a large motorized distributor. In the end none of these systems proved very popular, and the success of B‚ÄìT systems and small moving-loops suitable for higher frequencies used for aircraft communications allowed DF systems to be carried on the vehicles.

History When the Vale of Glamorgan Railway opened in 1897, four of its five original stations served the principal settlements along the route. The fifth station, Southerndown Road acted as a feeder station for a number of smaller villages nearby.Chapman 1998, p. 61 However, this arrangement was not entirely satisfactory, as there was a long stretch of line between this station and Llantwit Major which was left unserved by trains. To an extent, this did not matter, because most settlements lay well to the south of the railway. The one exception was Llandow, which was located very near to the line, but had very inadequate road access to the two nearest stations. As a result, the Llandow Parish Council requested that the railway company erect a halt. The first request was in 1898, with another in 1901, but these were both refused. In 1905, with the introduction of steam railmotor services on the line, the Barry Railway Company agreed to erect halts at Llandow and Fontigary, but in the event, these were not built. A further request in 1908 was turned down. It was not until 1915 that the company accepted a fourth application and approved the building of Llandow Halt. It received provisional sanction from the Board of Trade on 20 April 1915 and opened on 1 May. It had cost ¬£250 to build.Chapman 1998, p. 61 Description Llandow Halt was a very basic affair. It had two wooden platforms, each 130 feet in length. Each platform had an open-fronted wooden shelter. The crossing was at ground level and was provided with an electric bell for safety. The bell was operated by treadles placed on both lines 250 feet along from the crossing. Additional signals in the existing signal box had been added. The inspection of the new facilities (which did not occur until 15 October 1915) was entirely satisfied with these arrangements.Chapman 1998, p. 65 Closure The station closed in 1964 when passenger services along the line were withdrawn.Chapman 1998, p. 87 Notes References Chapman, Colin (1998) The Vale of Glamorgan Railway The Oakwood Press Category:Disused railway stations in the Vale of Glamorgan Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1915 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1964 Category:Former Barry Railway stations Category:Beeching closures in Wales ","title":"Llandow Halt railway station"},{"id":"43325798","text":"Vladimir Yarets (right) and David McNett (left) in Auckland, New Zealand 2007 Vladimir Yarets (–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–µ–≤–∏—á –Ø—Ä–µ—Ü) (born May 5, 1941) is round the world traveler from Belarus.

Life Reding spent his childhood in Bech, a village near Echternach and has lived in Fischbach, Mersch and in Folschette by Rambrouch, with his current residence being in Luxembourg City. Reding is the father of four children and is married to Karine Reuter, former Judge and currently Notary in P√©tange. Reding went to school in Echternach with, among others, the former Justice and Culture Minister Octavie Modert and the former Secretary-General of the DP, Georges Gudenburg. Having obtained his qualification of secondary education, Reding studied Law at the Paul C√©zanne University in Aix-en-Provence, whence he obtained a Bachelor of Laws. Ensuing this degree, Reding obtained a Master of Laws from the University Robert Schumann in Stra√üburg. Having obtained his master's degree, Reding started working on 1 August 1989 as a solicitor in the luxembourgish bank BGL BNP Paribas. In May 1990, Reding received his official admission to the Luxembourgish Bar, allowing him to open a chancery in 1993, namely the Chancery Reding and Felten in Luxembourg City. After the separation of the two associates, Reding opened his own chancery in the city centre, located in the Rue de l'Eau. He retired as a lawyer in 2019 in order to be able to act more independently as an MP and not fall under the possible consequences from the bar. He stated \\"retiring as a lawyer gives me the possibility to talk freely on each subject without fearing professional repercussions Local politics Reding's first became involved in politics at the age of 15, when he became a member of the LSAP and their youth organization JSL. He engaged actively in politics whilst at school. He was the elected school representative in the Conseil d'Education as well as chief editor of the school newspaper De Maulwuerf. During his time at university, he was president of the National Union of Luxembourgish Students (UNEL) as well as the president of the Socialist Students (Etudiants Socialistes). He also worked as a free-lance journalist for the Tageblatt during this time. In 1999 he was elected as a councilman in the Council of Fischbach, receiving the second largest share of the vote. National Politics The trigger for Reding's entry into national politics was the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, (commonly referred to as the European Constitution or as the Constitutional Treaty), against which Reding vehemently protested with the viewpoint that the government was manipulating voters with false statements and propaganda in order to get them to ratify the Treaty. Reding became politically active in the ADR following this, whose views he shared and for whom he ran for the since 2005 unoccupied seat in the Council of State of Luxembourg. At the National Congress of the ADR in 2006, Reding was voted into the position of Secretary-General. During the Parliamentary elections of 7 June 2009 and the 2009 European Parliament election, Reding ran for a seat in both the National and EU parliaments. He narrowly missed out on a seat in the national parliament by a couple of hundred votes, coming second on the ADR centre list behind Jacques-Yves Henckes. In the National Congress of 25 March 2012, Reding was voted into the position of Vice-President. In the snap elections of October 2013, Reding reclaimed the centre seat for the ADR after Jacques-Yves Henckes left the party. On 13 November 2013, Reding was sworn in as a Member of Parliament. He became a member of the Parliamentary Commissions for Justice, Agriculture and Viticulture, Consumer Protection, Secondary Education, Media and Communication, and Research. He was also elected as a representative for Luxembourg in the Benelux Parliament. Reding was re-elected in the October 2018 elections, improving his vote share by 12.4% to a total of 6,319. . dok  Reding is presenter on the Luxembourgish Channel \\".dok\\".

At first the goal was to preserve and market traditional home crafts that were seen as being at risk of dying out. Demand for high quality products and a shift towards more \\"professional\\" craftspeople and modern designs placed stress on the organization. In 1967 the provincial branches became autonomous, and subsequently evolved separately. At the national level the Guild was merged with the Canadian Craftsman's Association in 1974 to form the Canadian Crafts Council, now the Canadian Crafts Federation. Origins The Montreal branch of the Women's Art Association of Canada (WAAC) was founded in 1894 by Mary Martha Phillips and Mary Alice Peck. The Montreal branch held major exhibits of applied arts in 1900 and 1902, and in June 1902 opened a store, Our Handicrafts Shop. The Montreal WAAC was a precursor of the Canadian Handicrafts Guild. The same women were involved in both organizations. The crafts committee of the Montreal branch broke away from the WAAC in 1905, becoming the Canadian Handicrafts Guild. The Handicrafts Guild, led by Alice Peck and May Phillips, was incorporated in 1906. It was a federal non-profit organization, with the Governor General Albert Grey and Alice, Countess Grey as patrons. The objectives of the Guild were to support and encourage crafts in Canada. The Guild was modeled on an idealized view of the medieval guild, and was dedicated to preserving traditional ethnic crafts, seen to be at risk of dying out. It encouraged craftspeople to work together collectively to meet market needs, selling their goods anonymously. History Mme. Soulier, bobbin lace maker at the Canadian Handicraft Exhibition at the Manitoba Agricultural College, Fort Garry (June 1933) =Early years= The guild set up a reference library in 1909. That year Alice Peck proposed that the Guild should start a permanent collection holding some of the best handwork. The guild sold handicrafts at its shop and through agencies. It awarded prizes at annual competitions and ran educational programs, including classes for immigrant children and a weaving school. By 1911 the Guild was very active across Canada and abroad. From 1905 to 1935 the guild exhibited the work of the First Nations at what is now the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. In the 1930s the guild opened branch offices in each province. The Manitoba branch was formed in January 1928 by a group of over 30 women at a meeting in Winnipeg, led by Lady Constance Nanton. The organization became interested in education, and as the shop grew they also placed more emphasis on quality of design and workmanship. =1930s= Women's Institute, Lower Granville. Annapolis County, Nova Scotia, displaying a hooked rug In May 1932 the Canadian Handicrafts League (the Guild) announced that the Handicrafts Association of Canada, based in Toronto, had become affiliated with the Montreal-based organization. That year the Handicrafts League obtained the use of one third of the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto for a large display of handicrafts from across Canada. It was hoped that farmers and country people suffering from the Great Depression would benefit from the League's support. In July 1932 the local paper in Medicine Hat, Alberta, reported that \\"... there seems to be some doubt about just how many handicraft organizations there are in the country, I think our local Canadian Handicraft Guild must be connected with the Handicrafts Association of Canada Incorporated.\\" The writer described the Handicrafts Association's aim as helping to sell the products of Canadian craftsmen and people making crafts for occupational therapy, such as disabled soldiers. The association had a shop in downtown Toronto stocked with an array of products from the east, but so far with no western crafts. In May 1933 it was announced that the Canadian Handicrafts Guild had received letters of support from leaders and organizations across the country for their planned exhibition in Montreal for the end of October. It was planned to bring Quebec handicraft workers from their farms to Montreal to demonstrate their work. Some would be seeing the city for the first time. Participating organization included the Guild's branches in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island, the Art Association of Montreal, the Women's Art Society, Montreal, and Union Catholique des Cultivateurs, the Handicrafts Association of Canada of Toronto and the Mount Allison Handicrafts Guild of Sackville, New Brunswick. Products exhibited would include homespuns, tweed from a blend of angora and sheep's wool, Indian basketwork, hooked rugs, quilt, blankets and furniture. Lt.-Col. Wilfrid Bovey was re-appointed president of the guild for 1934. He reported on a successful year in 1933, with high attendance at exhibitions in Edmonton (125,000), Winnipeg (50,000) and Montreal (32,000). Other exhibitions had been held in Toronto, Charlottetown and Banff. Two new branches had been formed, one in Prince Edward Island and the other in the Ottawa Valley. Cape Breton Home Industries, founded by Mrs. Alexander Graham Bell, and the Mabel Hubbard Club of Montreal were now associated with the guild. Finances were in good shape, despite a drop in sales volumes. In 1936 the newly formed Canadian Guild of Potters decided to join the Handicrafts guild. That year the Handicrafts Guild assigned its assets and liabilities to a new branch in Quebec, which assumed a leading role among the other guilds across the country. In 1937 the Guild participated in the international Art, Craft and Science exhibition in Paris, France. =Post-war= Solomonie, watched by his daughter Annie, working on a model kayak for the Canadian Handicrafts Guild (July 1951) In the early 1950s the Guild began to help the Inuit people of Port Harrison, Quebec, to sell their arts and crafts. Craft organizations in the 1950s changed focus from traditional to modern art, and acquired a more professional image. The artists now began to be recognized as individuals, in contrast to the earlier collective identity. By the 1960s the Guild was struggling to define its direction. It had originally been concerned with home arts, but neglected the growing numbers of fine craftsmen. The Montreal branch realized that by failing to enforce quality standards it had lost standing with the latter group. Their 1963 exhibition was therefore strictly juried. In 1967 the national association and all the branch offices became autonomous. Successor organizations The Canadian Craftsman's Association was formed as an alternative national craft organization after the 1964 First World Congress of Craftsmen. In 1974 the Canadian Handicrafts Guild merged with the Canadian Craftsman's Association to form the Canadian Crafts Council (CCC), based in Ottawa. At first the CCC was a federation of provincial crafts councils. Later it accepted membership from other crafts organizations. In 1996 the Council began accepting craftspeople as individual members. However, that year the Federal government stopped funding and the Council had to close its offices and lay off its staff. It continued as a legal entity, run by volunteers, but had no resources to run programs. In May 1998 the CCC was transformed into a national crafts network, the Canadian Crafts Federation / F√©d√©ration canadienne des m√©tiers d'art. The members are the ten provincial crafts councils. The Quebec branch became the Canadian Guild of Crafts Quebec. It is now called simply the Canadian Guild of Crafts. In 2014 the Ontario Crafts Council rebranded itself as Crafts Ontario. The Craftsmen's Association of British Columbia, later renamed the Crafts Council of British Columbia, was initially based in the Dominion Building in downtown Vancouver. It moved to Cartwright Street in Granville Island in December 1979 with federal government funding.
