It was also the working title for a full-length feature film based on the shorts, which was later released as Lovely By Surprise.  Synopsis of plot  The film is about two brothers, Humkin and Mopekey, who live on a boat; the boat sits on land and is isolated in the middle of a field in some unspecified part of America. The two brothers live a solitary existence; they are clothed only in underwear, and have no communication with the outside world, with the exception of a few signals received through the ship's radio. Their sustenance takes the form of milk which is delivered by an equally mysterious milkman and a cereal consisting of frosted sugar balls; the origin of the food is not made clear.  Feature Film  Kirt Gunn directed a full-length feature film based on both the episodes comprising The Neverything, as well as the episodes of a parallel series of shorts titled Lovely By Surprise which followed the author of the brothers' fictional world. Originally advertised with the title The Neverything, the feature was re-titled Lovely By Surprise before its release.  Sponsorship  The production, promotion and release of the film is significantly tied to commercial promotion; \\"The Neverything\\" was made under the provision of Mercury, a division of Ford Motor Company, and Mercury is using its broadcast of the \\"webisodes\\" as an alternative to traditional marketing channels.

He established empirical rules for the analysis of spectral lines, which remain associated with his name. In 1897 he discovered the Anomalous Zeeman Effect, a phenomenon noted when the spectral lines of elements were studied in the presence or absence of a magnetic field. Preston reported, in an important paper published in The Scientific Transactions of The Royal Dublin Society, read on 22 December 1897, and published the following April, that he reported results more complicated than Zeeman had reported. Following this up further, he reported in a second paper in the RDS Scientific Transactions, read on 18 January 1899, and published the following June, that he had found results that were ‚Äôvery startling‚Äô and appeared ‚Äòquite contrary to all theoretical explanations‚Äô. The full explanation had to wait for the theory of relativity and the introduction of quantum mechanics, which were to shake the rigid framework of Newtonian conceptions of absolute time and space. Preston‚Äôs results were an important step in this development. Preston was at the forefront of the Maxwellian research programme led by George Johnstone Stoney and George Francis FitzGerald. Preston famously tackled Stoney in what became a public dispute over a mathematical conclusion in this research programme which concerned electromagnetic and spectroscopic sciences. Stoney who is accredited with naming the electron was in opposition to Preston on this particular matter. John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh president of the Royal Dublin Society intervened in this argument in Prestons defence. He was educated at The Royal School, Armagh, the Royal University of Ireland and Trinity College, Dublin. From 1891 to 1900 he was Professor of Natural Philosophy at University College Dublin. He was a Fellow of the Royal University of Ireland and of the Royal Society, London and was a distinguished spectroscopist. His two major textbooks remained in continuous use for over 50 years. He enrolled in Trinity College, Dublin, in 1881, working under the physicist George FitzGerald (known for his work in electromagnetics) and graduated with a BA in mathematics in 1885. The previous year he had sat the Royal University of Ireland degree examinations which also earned him a BA from there with a first in mathematical science. He enrolled in Trinity College, Dublin, in 1881, and worked under the physicist George FitzGerald, known for his work in electromagnetics. While at University College Dublin, he wrote a book, The Theory of Light. In 1899 he won the second Boyle Medal presented by the Royal Dublin Society. He died at his home, Bardowie, Orwell Park, Rathgar, Dublin, on 7 March 1900 of a perforated ulcer just as he was reaching the height of his academic powers. Family He was father to the physicist Prof George Dawson Preston FRSE (1896-1972).

Gurktal near Reichenau The Gurk rises in the Nock Mountains (Gurktal Alps) range of the Central Eastern Alps, near the border with the Austrian state of Styria. Its sources are two small cirque lakes, the Gurksee and the Torersee near Albeck and the Turracher H√∂he Pass, a protected area since 1981. The Gurksee has an elevation of , an area of , and is deep; the Torersee lies above sea level, has an area of , and is deep. Since both lake are completely frozen in the winter, they contain no fish. It flows southwest to Ebene Reichenau and then turns eastwards running through Gnesau and the Gurktal valley to the market town of Gurk.

The event currently carries a purse of $100,000. History The event was inaugurated on 18 May 1952 as the Sea Breeze Stakes and was run at Hollywood Park Racetrack in Inglewood, California before a crowd of 41,369. The event was run over 6 furlongs on the dirt and was won by Tonga in an upset starting at 51-1 defeating Princess Lygia and A Gleam. The event honors the outstanding California bred mare, Honeymoon who won several races at Hollywood Park including the inaugural running of the Hollywood Oaks in 1946. Honeymoon was also successful at Santa Anita Park winning the 1948 Santa Maria Handicap. The event was changed to the Honeymoon Stakes in 1956 then the Honeymoon Handicap in 1975. The event was run in divisions in 1957 and 1965. The event was first run on the turf track in 1973. The event was a Grade II from 1998 to 2018. After the closure of the Hollywood Park Racetrack in 2013 the event has been held at Santa Anita Park.

Like the Middlesex county teams formed by earlier organisations from the early 18th century, the county club has always held first-class status.ACS, First-Class Matches, p. 11. It has also run a List A team since the beginning of limited overs cricket in 1963;, as well as a top-class Twenty20 team since the inauguration of the Twenty20 Cup in 2003. These are three separate categories. The details are the player's usual name followed by the years in which he was active as a Middlesex player and then his name is given as it usually appears on match scorecards. Note that many players represented other top-class teams besides Middlesex and some players such as Nick Compton left the county but later returned. Current players are shown as active to the latest season in which they played for the club. The list excludes Second XI and other players who did not play for the club's first team; and players whose first team appearances were in minor matches only. Players who represented the county before 1864 are included if they also played for the county club but excluded if not. All players known to have represented the county before the formation of the county club are included in List of Middlesex county cricketers to 1863.

History The event is named in honor of United States Triple Crown and Hall of Fame trainer L√°zaro \\"Laz\\" Barrera. The inaugural running of the event is debatable since there are two paths that converge to the realization of the current event. The Los Angeles Turf Club which holds the event at Santa Anita believe that the current L√°zaro Barrera Stakes has its beginnings via the Playa Del Rey Stakes which has its first running in 1953 at Hollywood Park Racetrack in Inglewood, California. This event was set for Californian bred three year old fillies at a distance of 7 furlongs. The event was run one more time and then was idle until 1995. The other path merits consideration. With regard to the first running of the Affirmed Handicap in 1981, the event was named after the 1978 United States Triple Crown Champion Affirmed who was trained by L√°zaro Barrera. This event was held in the fall and was changed in 1991 by the Hollywood Turf Club to the Lazaro S. Barrera Handicap four years before the renewal of the Playa Del Rey Stakes in 1995, the implied predecessor to the current event. In 1999 the Hollywood Turf Club scheduled the Lazaro Barrera Memorial Stakes in late May at the current distance of 7 furlongs. The event was upgraded to a Grade II event in 2002, and was downgraded to Grade III in 2007. In 2013 the event was run as the Listed Came Home Stakes.

The theory was independently developed by Canadian geologist Reginald Aldworth Daly and American geologist Joseph Barrell.1925\\\\. Biographical Memoir of Joseph Barrell by Charles Schuchert The process involves the mechanical disintegration of the surrounding country/host rock, typically through fracturing due to pressure increases associated with thermal expansion of the host rock in proximity of the interface with the melt. After fractures are formed, melt and/or volatiles will typically invade, widening the fracture and promoting the foundering of host rock blocks (i.e. stoped blocks). Once suspended in the melt, stoped blocks may either sink or float depending upon the density of the block relative to that of the melt. Additionally, blocks submerged within melt are subject to further thermally-induced fracturing which may account for the often observed \\"lack of evidence\\" for the process of stoping.

The event currently offers a purse of $150,000 added. History The event was inaugurated as the Meadowlands Cup and held at the Meadowlands Racetrack on 29 October 1977 and was won by Pay Tribute who was trained by the Hall of Fame trainer Ron McAnally and ridden by Hall of Fame jockey √Ångel Cordero Jr. by lengths in a time of 2:02 over the miles distance. The event was the signature event at the Meadowlands track with its high stakes attracting class horses. Within two years when champion three-year-old Spectacular Bid won the event in stakes record time it was classed as Grade II. The event was upgraded to Grade I in 1983. The event was decreased to its present miles distance in 1990. That year's running posed one of the largest upsets in North American racing history when Great Normand won at 181-1 odds. There was no race held in 1997 or 2011. The race was downgraded from a Grade II to a Grade III in 2017, and the purse was reduced to $100,000 from the previous $200,000. The event was moved to Monmouth Park in 2010 and was renamed to the Monmouth Cup Stakes. Sharp Azteca's win in 2017 set a track record at Monmouth for the distance of miles, beating Formal Gold's 1:40.20 that was set in August 1997.

Spangenberg (1922-1942), who died as a result of wounds suffered during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, while serving aboard the heavy cruiser . He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. Spangenberg, a destroyer escort, was laid down on 5 April 1943 by the Philadelphia Navy Yard; launched on 3 July 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Gussie Spangenberg; and commissioned on 15 April 1944, Lieutenant Thomas H. P. Whitney in command. Service history=World War II, 1944-1945 After completing trials around Philadelphia and Norfolk, Virginia and shakedown in the vicinity of Bermuda, Spangenberg returned to Norfolk on 1 June. She served temporarily as school ship for student officers and as escort to coastwise merchant traffic before beginning duty with transatlantic convoys. On 13 July, the destroyer escort joined Escort Division 66 (CortDiv 66) and put to sea the next day from Hampton Roads, Virginia, in the screen of a convoy bound for the Mediterranean Sea. The convoy, UGS 48, made a fairly quiet passage until the day before it reached Bizerte, Tunisia. At 01:00 on 1 August, a flight of about 20 German bombers attacked the formation. Spangenberg was able to lay a good smoke screen which helped to prevent the German attack from damaging the American ships. This was Spangenbergs only brush with the Luftwaffe. The convoy made Bizerte on 2 August, and Spangenberg stayed for 11 days before sailing for the United States on the 13th. She reached Boston on the 28. From 9/17 September, CortDiv 66 conducted training exercises at Casco Bay, Maine. Spangenberg returned to Hampton Roads on 20 September and, two days later, sailed in the screen of convoy UGS 55, headed for North Africa. She was at Bizerte from 12/18 October; then she screened the convoy back to the United States and arrived in Boston on 6 November. Spangenberg and the other ships of CortDiv 66 conducted more exercises at Casco Bay and, at the end of November, moved to Argentia, Newfoundland, to act as killer group for Task Unit 27.1.2. She conducted anti-submarine searches around Argentia and Halifax until February 1945 and, on one occasion, made a depth charge attack on a sound contact, but scored no kill. The destroyer escort spent February operating with friendly submarines in Block Island Sound, Long Island Sound, and in the area south of Block Island. Spangenberg began an availability period at Boston on 3 March. After a short cruise to Casco Bay on 20/21 March, she got underway for Horta in the Azores, en route to England. She arrived in Liverpool on 3 April. From that port, she moved to Derry in Northern Ireland. There CortDiv 66, under British control, operated as an anti-submarine escort group out of Derry and out of Milford Haven, England. Spangenberg returned to the United States at New York City on 1 June 1945 and was converted to a radar picket destroyer escort. Post-war activities, 1945-1947 At the completion of her conversion and post-conversion trials, Spangenberg sailed from New York for Port Arthur, Texas, to participate in the Navy Day celebration. On 3 November 1945, she headed toward Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for three weeks of refresher training. The destroyer escort departed Cuban waters on the 26 and returned to Norfolk, Virginia. For the next 18 months, Spangenberg sailed up and down the eastern coast of the United States engaged in training exercises. During that period, she left that area only once, in May/June 1947, to carry scientists of the Naval Research Laboratory south of the equator to observe an eclipse of the sun. She returned the scientists to Washington, D.C. on 9 June, stopped at Norfolk for a month, and then reported to Charleston, South Carolina, on 18 July 1947 for inactivation. In reserve, 1947-1966 Spangenberg remained berthed at Charleston as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet for almost 18 years. In March 1949, she was redesignated a radar picket destroyer escort, DER-223, but, on 1 December 1954, reverted to a destroyer escort, DE-223. Spangenbergs name was struck from the Navy List on 1 November 1965 and, on 4 October 1966, her hulk was sold to the North American Smelting Company of Wilmington, Delaware, for scrapping.

It reduced their number and clarified those preserved. As is customary for such documents, the bull is known by its incipit, the opening words of the text. Background Church laws imposing censures were multiplied in the course of centuries, some confirming, modifying or abrogating previous enactments. The Council of Trent (1545-63) simplified them, but numerous new laws continued to be enacted, altering and complicating the previous situation. The result was confusion for canonists, perplexity for moralists, and often hesitation for the faithful. Hence the need for a general revision of all the material.Introductory part of the document, pages 55 and 56 of the printed text Contents The automatic censures that in their revised form were kept were organized in a number of categories according to the authority that had the power to absolve from them: * Automatic excommunications reserved to the Roman Pontiff in a special manner (12 censures)Pages 57, 58, 59, 60 of the printed text * Automatic excommunications simply reserved to the Roman Pontiff (17 censures)Pages 61, 62, 63, 64 * Automatic excommunications reserved to bishops or ordinaries (3 censures)Pages 64-65 * Automatic excommunications not reserved to anyone, i.e., ones from which simple priests could absolve (4 censures)Pages 65 and 66 * Automatic suspensions reserved to the Pope (7 censures)Pages 67, 68 and 69 * Automatic interdicts reserved (2 censures) Observations Although a censure is merely a medicinal penalty, the chief purpose of which is the reformation of the person who has incurred it, it does not cease of itself merely by one's reformation. It has to be taken away by the power that inflicts it. The censures are classified in Apostolicae Sedis moderationi with respect to the authority that has the power to absolve from them. Any priest who has jurisdiction to absolve from sin can also absolve from censures, unless a censure be reserved, as a sin might be reserved; and some of the censures named in the Bull \\"Apostolicae Sedis\\" are not reserved. Some censures of Apostolicae Sedis moderationi are reserved to bishops; so that bishops, within their own jurisdiction, or someone specially delegated by them, can absolve from censures so reserved. Some are reserved to the Pope, so that not even a bishop can absolve from these without a delegation from the Pope. Twelve censures are reserved in a special manner (speciali modo) to the Pope; so that to absolve from any of these, even a bishop requires a delegation that specifically names them. These twelve censures, except the tenth, were taken from the Bull In Coena Domini, so called because from 1364 to 1770 it was annually published at Rome, and after 1567 elsewhere also, on Holy Thursday. Of these eleven canonical offences, five refer to attacks on the foundation of the Church, that is, on its faith and constitution. Three refer to attacks on the power of the Church and on the free exercise of that power. The other three refer to attacks on the spiritual or temporal treasures of the Church. Of the total of 45 censures, one (the fourth among those from which absolution was reserved to the Pope, but not in a special manner) was directed against membership of \\"Freemasonry, Carbonari and similar groups\\".

It serves the Triad and Triangle areas, which includes cities such as Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Raleigh and Durham. In addition the signal goes well north of Danville, Virginia. The outlet, which is owned by Curtis Media Group, claims to have the largest FM radio signal in all of North Carolina, operating with an ERP of 100 kW. The reason for that FM radio signal claim comes from Curtis Media, due to the population covered by the station's signal. The transmitter is located on Bass Mountain in the Cane Creek Mountains in Alamance County, and studios are in Burlington. History WBBB-FM signed on at 101.3 in 1946 as a sister station to WBBB in Burlington, North Carolina. After moving to 101.1, the station became easy listening WNCB. Starting in 1978, WPCM was \\"Country 101\\" radio station. During the 1990s, the station paired up with WKIX in Goldsboro, North Carolina and targeted listeners in the Raleigh market.David Menconi, \\"KIX walks; 96.1 to Shift\\", News & Observer, January 9, 1998. At one point, the call letters were changed to WKXU. For a time, this station played classic country.\\"Greensboro News Briefs,\\" Greensboro News and Record, April 8, 2004. Later, WKXU switched to country music, calling itself Kix 101.1. The station changed to a news/talk format under the WZTK call letters on July 6, 2004. The first live voices heard on \\"FM Talk 101.1\\" were those of Brad Krantz and Britt Whitmire, who remained with the station for the format's duration. WZTK's sister AM station WPCM (920 kilohertz), previously known as WBBB, simulcasted the FM's talk programming until summer 2005, when it went back to its beach/oldies format. ABC News Radio broadcast on the hour 24/7. Listeners heard a variety of talk shows including Michael Savage, Alan Colmes, as well as financial advice from Clark Howard, and local/state issues. FM Talk 101.1 also offered smooth jazz weekends. WZTK was once an affiliate of Jones Radio Networks's Smooth Jazz satellite-delivered format until the format was discontinued on September 30, 2008. It continued to air on WZTK without announcers, with music provided by Jones Radio/Dial Global. The station was also an affiliate of the Carolina Panthers Radio Network and carried Wake Forest University football & men's basketball. On February 14, 2007, WZTK's parent company, Curtis Media Group, closed a purchase of WSJS, WMFR, and WSJS's simulcast partner WSML. This gave Curtis a monopoly on news/talk in the Triad (and for all practical purposes, in the Triangle, as well) until WPTI and WRDU switched to the format in January 2010. Both WMFR and WSML joined newly acquired WCOG to form Triad Sports Radio later that year. On March 12, 2012, Curtis Media Group announced it would end the News/Talk format after 8 years. Brad and Britt, Neil Boortz, and Clark Howard all moved to WSJS and WPTK, while Alan Colmes, Michael Savage, and Allan Handelman were displaced entirely. At Midnight on March 13, 2012, after the 2nd hour of The Alan Colmes Show, the station flipped to a simulcast of WWPL. This was a placeholder move as Curtis Media Group prepared a new format that they promise will have more community service and long-term profitability.http://www.curtismedia.com/wztk/ WZTK launched its new format in Spanish on April 3 by simulcasting WYMY, this time as \\"La Ley 96.9 & 101.1 FM.\\" On January 3, 2013, WZTK changed their call letters to WYMY when 96.9 FM became WBZJ and ended the simulcast. On March 11, 2014, the simulcast resumed,La Ley Raleigh Returns to 96.9 but six months later, it ended again after WYMY solved some weather-related signal problems.

Animation. The channel launched on 27 May 2000 as a spin-off of Cartoon Network and localization of the original American network. It is run by AT&T;'s WarnerMedia under its International division. History=Origins Boomerang UK began as a block in 1993. UK launch Boomerang launched on 27 May 2000, airing between 06:00‚Äì00:00, on Sky Digital and certain cable systems. Cartoon Network at the time had a tight schedule and so the channel was created by Turner Broadcasting to broadcast classic cartoons from the Hanna-Barbera, MGM and Warner Bros archive programme library, as well as freeing its sister network of many classics in the schedule. In May 2001, Boomerang became the second highest-rated children's channel, beaten only by parent service Cartoon Network. In July of that year, the channel was added to on cable operator Telewest, thus increasing its viewership. James Greville, head of Cartoon Network UK at the time, stated, \\"The channel launched barely a year ago and yet it's already beaten established kids' channels in terms of ratings and share\\". By November, the channel was avaliable on NTL. Boomerang increased its library of old cartoons by acquiring rights to other animated shows such as Danger Mouse, The Pink Panther and Garfield and Friends. By the end of 2003, the channel started to move away from its original purpose and moved to broadcast more recent programming. A one-hour timeshift channel, Boomerang +1, launched on 6 March 2006. Boomerang rebranded with the new international graphics package developed by UK based graphic design agency Art&Graft; on 16 February 2015. The channel switched to 16:9 widescreen on 1 June 2015.

She was expressive, light and dramatic in style. In 1699, Prevost debuted at the Acad√©mie d'Opera in the ballet, Atys, later replacing Marie-Th√©r√®se de Subligny as the female lead. In 1708, she performed with Jean Balon in the final scene of Corneille's Les Horaces. The performance, though only of the final scene of the play and entirely in pantomime, is said to have caused the audience to weep. The \\"pantomime\\" came from the popular theaters of the time and freely used bold gestures and body language to communicate the narrative to the audience. The goal was to convey a story of meaning using purely movement, without spoken word. Maintaining her interest in the dramatic potential of dance, Prevost created a famous solo in 1714 called \\"Les Caracteres de la Danse.\\" Choreographed to a suite of dances by composer Jean Ferry Rebel, the \\"characters\\" depicted a series of lovers of varying ages and sexes, and Prevost enacted each one to a different piece of music: the bourree, the menuet, the passepied. She taught this solo to her two most accomplished female students: Marie Camargo and Marie Sall√©. Camargo was the first to learn the solo for her debut at the Paris Opera. Her growing success incited jealousy in Prevost, and she relegated Camargo to the corps de ballet. One day however, Camargo made an spectacular impromptu improvisation solo for a missing male dancer. The arrival of Marie Salle, and her dramatic recreation of the famous solo into a pas de deux of rich emotional interaction, highlighted the different approaches to dance of the period: technical flash verses dramatic depth. Prevost retired as premi√®re danseuse in 1730, being replaced by her students. See also *Women in dance References Source: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica \\"Fran√ßoise Pr√©vost\\".

He is known as the incarnation of Lord Kartikeya in Kali Yuga. Sidh Baba Balak Nath is known as the \\"merciful (one who forgives all the sins)\\" god incarnated in Kali Yuga. He is the follower of Lord shiva(Shaivism) . Early life The most popular story about the birth of Baba Balak Nath as 'sidh-purush' is associated with the Amar Katha of Lord Shiva. It is said that Lord Shiva was sharing the Amar Katha with Goddess Parvati in the cave of Amarnath, and Goddess Parvati fell asleep. A kid-parrot was there in the cave and he was listening the entire story and was making noise of 'yes' (\\"hmm..\\"). When the story finished, Lord Shiva found Goddess Parwati sleeping and so he understood that someone else had heard the story. He became very angry and threw his Trishul (trident) on the kid-parrot. The kid-parrot escaped from there to save his life and Trishul followed him. In the way, the wife of Rishi Vyasa was yawning. The kid-parrot entered her stomach through her mouth. The Trishul stopped, as it was unreligious to kill a lady. When Lord Shiva knew all this he also came there and narrated his problem to Rishi Vyas. Rishi Vyas told him that he should wait there and as the kid-parrot would come out, he could kill him. Lord Shiva stood there for a very long time but the kid-parrot did not come out. As Lord Shiva stood there, the whole universe got disordered. Then all the Lords met Sage Narada and requested him to request Lord Shiva to save the world. Then Narada came to Lord Shiva and prayed him to leave his anger as the child had already heard the Amar Katha.and so now he had become immortal and now nobody could kill him. Listening to this, Lord Shiva told the kid-parrot to come out and in return the kid-parrot demanded a blessing from him. Lord Shiva accepted that and the kid-parrot prayed that as he comes out as a man, any other child who gets birth at the same time would be granted all kind of knowledge and would be immortal. As Lord Shiva accepted this, a divine baby come out from the mouth of Rishi Vyas. He prayed Lord Shiva and got his blessings. This divine baby was called Sukhdev Muni later. The other babies who got birth at that time were famous as Navnatha and eighty-four siddhas (Chaurasi Sidh). One of them was Baba Balak Nath. Connection with Lord Shiva in Dvapara Yuga : It is believed about Baba Balak Nath that he takes birth in every age (yuga). He appeared as \\"Skanda\\" in Satya Yuga, as \\"Kaul\\" in Treta Yuga and as \\"Mahakaul\\" in Dvapara Yuga. In Dvapara Yuga, Baba Balak Nath was in the way to Kailash Dham with a wish to meet Lord Shiva. In the way he met with an old lady. The lady asked him where he is going. Then Baba Balak Nath who was Mahakaul told her that he is praying Lord Shiva since last three births but he had not been blessed by Lord Shiva with his appearance and so he was moving towards Kailash Dham with this very wish. The old lady told Baba that it was not easy to have a live appearance of Lord Shiva. You have to do something extraordinary. When Baba asked her what he should do,she told that Baba should stand in the foothills of the Kailash near Mansarovar and pray there. Mata Parwati used to come there on some occasions for bath. When Mata Parwati comes there he should pray her to fulfill her wish. Mata Parwati will surely try to give him something else but he should insist on his wish only. Baba Balak Nath stood for twelve gharis with the old lady and moved towards the Man Sarovar. He did the same as the old lady had advised him and finally Lord Shiva was pleased and blessed him to be Paramsidh in Kali Yuga that he would remain as Balak (young) and age would not affect him. MahaKaul of Dvapara Yuga got birth in Kali Yuga at Kathiyawad in the house of Narayan Vishnu and Laxmi. Parent named him as \\"Dev\\". Dev was very religious from his childhood and he used to pray all the times. His parents then tried to marry him so that he cannot leave the home. Dev was not ready for this. When he was so much under pressure for marriage he left home and moved towards Girnar Parwat in the search of Paramsiddhi. In Junagarh he met with Swami Dattatreya. Here at the ashram of Swami Dattatreya, he got divine knowledge and emerged as Sidh. As Lord Shiva had blessed him that age will not affect him he remained as a child and called \\"Balak Nath\\". Miracle Miracle in Shah Talai : It is believed that Babaji came to Bachhretu Mahadev from Kurukshetra where he had come with saints at the time of Solar Eclipse. Thereafter Babaji came to ShahTalai and met \\"Ratno Mai\\" - the epitome of \\"Dwapra's old woman, who had guided \\"Mahakaul Babaji\\". Thus Babaji was to compensate what that old woman had done for him in \\"Dvapara Yuga\\". So Babaji took the most inconvenient work of Ratno Mai, that was cow- grazing. Babaji made his shelter below a Banyan Tree. He told Ratno Mai he would meditate below Banyan Tree and graze the cows side by side. He asked her to leave the bread and \\"Lassi\\" for him there for taking after meditation. Babaji committed with Ratno Mai to work for her as long she would remain satisfied. Everything remained smooth till twelve years. People started complaining the damage to crop field by the cows by the end of 12th year. Ratno Mai used to ignore such complaints but the complaint of village headman broke the patience of Ratno Mai and she started rebuking Babaji. So BabaJi took Ratno Mai and village headman to the field and miraculously there was no damage to the crops at all. Everybody was awestruck by this miracle. Babaji came back to his place of worship and asked RatniMai to take back her cows and let him go his way. Ratno Mai out of motherly affection tried to persuade BabaJi to stay back and reminded him about her providing bread and Lassi for 12 years. Babaji responded that it had been coincidental and further affirmed that he had kept all the bread and Lassi safely as he never consumed them. By saying that BabaJi threw his \\"Chimta\\" on the stem of banyan tree and the breads Roti supplied for 12 years came out. He further struck the same \\"Chimta\\" on the earth and a spring of Lassi started coming out taking the shape of a pond and the place came to be known as \\"Shaha Talai\\". On Babaji's stance for going away from Shaha Talai, Ratno Mai repented for her ignorance. On seeing all this, BabaJi lovingly told Ratno Mai that he would worship in forestland and she could see him there. He established His \\"Dhuna\\" below a \\"Gurna Jhari\\" (a thorny bush) about half kilometer from Shah Talai. A half hollow structure has been prepared to symbolize the \\"Hollow of banyan Tree\\". Nearby is a temple having the images of Baba Balak Nath, Gugga Chauhan and Nahar Singh Ji. Interaction with Guru Gorakh Nath One day Guru Gorakhnath along with his disciples came in the same area where Babaji was. Then, Guru Gorakhnath came to know about Baba ji and he reached where baba ji was. Babaji joined his hands to give respect to Guru Gorakh as he was an avtar of lord Shiva himself. Guru Gorakh decided to test the powers of babaji. Guru Gorakh asked Baba ji to provide them seats and food. Baba ji spread his mrigshala and Guru Gorakh with his followers took the seats on that and a large part of that was still unoccupied. Then babaji called a non milking barren cow which gave milk by the magic of babaji and then babaji served it to Guru Gorakhnath and his disciples.Finally, Guru Gorakh ordered his one of follower to fly his i.e. followers mirgshala in sky and asked babaji to bring that down, baba ji threw his firetoung to do so. It came down by the magic of babaji. Guru gorkh was so impressed. Reaching to deoth sidhh and cave: Next day, some disciples of guru Gorakh tried to put the earings in the ears of baba Balaknath. As the disciples of guru Gorakhnath ji tried to split the ears of balak nath ji, then the milk started coming out from the ears of baba balak nath and he escaped from their hands and came to another place which is now known as Deotsidh and cave. The Temple of Baba Balaknath is in Deotsidh, Himachal Pradesh. Babaji kept his foots in this place for first time where charan paduka temple is built now. From \\"Charan Paduka\\", BabaJi went to a cave on the hill. A demon came out of the cave and warned BabaJi to go away. Babaji, by his \\"sidh- shakti\\" forced the demon to vacate the cave for BabaJi's meditation. The demon understood the state of affairs and went away. Then BabaJi settled there for meditation. Bhartrihari also settled for meditation near that cave. One day, a Brahmin named as \\"Banarasi\\" from the nearby village Chakmoh came to that area for grazing his cows. BabaJi appeared before him and interacted. Brahmin told Babaji about his barren cows. Babaji asked where his cows were. Surprisingly only lions and tigers were there. After seeing the stunning posture of Brahmin, Babaji asked him to call his cows. Astonishingly, as the Brahmin called, his cows surrounded him. Seeing the miracle, Brahmin became the devotee of Babaji. Brahmin continued to see Babaji. One day Babaji told him that he would disappear one day and asked the Brahmin to continue the tradition of \\"Dhuna\\" and worshipping. Brahmin followed the point and maintained the tradition. A lamp remained lighted near Babaji whose light spread away in the nearby villages. Thus people had started calling Babaji as \\"Baba Deot Sidh\\" and later on the place became famous as \\"Baba Balaknath Gufa Deotsidh \\".

Shebib is a central figure in the development of English Canadian cinema who made several \\"lucid\\" short documentaries for the National Film Board of Canada and CBC Television in the 1960s before turning to feature films, beginning with the highly impactful and influential Goin' Down the Road (1970) and what many call his masterpiece, Between Friends (1973). He became frustrated by the bureaucratic process of film funding in Canada and chronic problems with distribution as well as a string of box office disappointments. After Heartaches (1981), he made fewer films for theatrical release and worked more in television. His most recent theatrical film is Down the Road Again, a sequel to his 1970 breakout feature. Early life Shebib was born in Toronto, the son of Mary Alice Long, a Newfoundlander, and Moses \\"Morris\\" Shebib, born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, in 1910, himself the son of Lebanese immigrants.http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/26291-iconic-canadian-film- goes-down-the-road-again Shebib grew up in Scarborough, Ontario, in an economically precarious household, and in a neighbourhood where he felt he was an outsider, \\"growing up with a name like Shebib, very working class, being raised a Catholic in Orange, Ontario\\", conceding he \\"probably took it more sensitively\\" than he had to, adding that he was always shy in high school: \\"I didn't know where I fit in. I grew up feeling pretty inferior.\\" In a 2011 interview with Andrea Nemetz in the Halifax Chronicle Herald, Shebib said: \\"I was aware of migratory experiences ‚Äì like the Okies in California in the dust bowl. I had a cousin who came to stay with us in Toronto in the late 1950s and he tried to make a go of it and couldn't and went back to the Maritimes.\\" The young Shebib grew up loving sports, comic books, and Hollywood \\"chestnuts\\" or vintage films, the family acquiring their first television set in 1952; for a certain time, Shebib refused to watch any film made after 1940. Education Shebib played semi-pro football as a young man, and studied sociology and history at the University of Toronto. While very interested in sociological patterns from history, he did not enjoy reading enough to pursue this interest further academically, but was still looking for something to do that would appeal to his \\"jock and artist impulses\\". In 1961, Shebib enrolled in the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, where he gained early experience working on Roger Corman productions, notably as a cinematographer and assistant editor on Dementia 13 (1962), his classmate Francis Ford Coppola's first film, and The Terror (1963). He also made his earliest short films. In 1965, he graduated with a Master of Arts, but decided to return home rather than pursue a career in Hollywood. Career Over the next five years, Shebib found his way into the Canadian film industry and quickly established himself, reflecting on his decision to return in 1970: > There's more of a chance here... and it's much easier to get started. There > isn't really all that much filmmaking to be done in the States. Educational > TV has opened up some opportunities for the documentary, but other than that > there is nothing at all. Period. Flat. Nothing exists. Nothing at all. Short documentaries Shebib directed, shot and edited several award- winning, \\"lucid\\" documentaries for the National Film Board of Canada, CTV Television Network, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in the 1960s, notably his thesis film, The Duel (1962), Surfin' (1964), Satan's Choice (1965), an inside view of the motorcycle club, and Good Times, Bad Times (1969), before turning to feature filmmaking. Feature filmsDebut= Shebib gained prominence and critical acclaim in Canadian cinema for his seminal 1970 feature Goin' Down the Road, which combined narrative storytelling with Canadian documentary tradition influenced by the British. The low-budget film crew travelled around Toronto in a station wagon, supported by funding from the newly formed Canadian Film Development Corporation. The movie was screened in New York and hailed by Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert. Kael wrote that the movie showed up the ostensibly forced sincerity and perceived honesty of the films of John Cassavetes. It has consistently remained near the top of the list of Top Ten films made in Canada in three separate surveys of academics, critics and film programmers, and was designated a \\"masterwork\\" by the AV Preservation Trust. In 1998 a DVD copy was struck from the master negative by the Toronto International Film Festival in conjunction with Telefilm Canada. The film was digitally remastered as one of the key films in the Canadian film canon and was honoured with a screening at the Art Gallery of Ontario. =Later features and sequel= Following the success of Goin' Down the Road, Shebib expressed a preference for making dramatic rather than documentary films going forward, and directed a mix of commercially unsuccessful genre films beginning with the teen comedy Rip-Off (1971) and the critically acclaimed Between Friends (1973), a somber story of a pair of aspiring surfers who plan a mining robbery in Northern Ontario that goes wrong. Shebib was one of four directors, and many critics, who felt the wrong film had won the Best Feature Film at the 25th Canadian Film Awards, which was already under pressure from a boycott of the awards by Quebec filmmakers. In its December 1973 year in review The Globe and Mail singled out the Canadian Film Award jury for a special \\"Grand Prix for General All-Around Stupidity\\" for the Awards' choice over four much stronger nominees.\\"The stinkers of '73\\". The Globe and Mail, December 29, 1973. Worse still, the ceremony itself was cancelled and all the promotional planning along with it: > In unison, the long promise of the Canadian industry and Don Shebib seemed > to be coming to fruition this year: Shebib had made the film which was the > confirmation of all his earher work; there were six strong feature entries > in the Canadian Film Awards; the Awards were to be carried on network > television; the films were booked to open across the country with full > publicity‚Äîall firsts. But instead both had their heads bitten off. Today, > Don Shebib says he will never again enter a film in the Canadian Film > Awards, that he needs a job and would take one in the U.S. in a minute. This > is not sour grapes from someone who's inadequate. This is English Canada's > best feature filmmaker reacting to the treatment of the best feature film > he's ever made. The awards scheduled for the following year were cancelled and did not return until 1975. Shebib did enter his next film, Second Wind (1976) and won the award for Best Editing. Neither it nor Fish Hawk (1979) were commercial successes. He found success once more with Heartaches (1981), described by Wyndham Wise as a variation of Goin' Down the Road with a pair of working- class women. Beginning in the 1980s, Shebib has worked primarily in television, but occasionally returned to feature films with Running Brave (1983), Change of Heart (1993), The Ascent (1994), and Down the Road Again (2011), a sequel to Goin' down the Road, featuring some of the original cast members as well as a new generation of characters. In between The Ascent and Down the Road Again, Shebib said there had been little work, though he had written a few scripts. There was some talk of Shebib directing Rob Stefaniuk in a film called Bart Fargo, an homage to La Petomane, in 2004 and 2005, but it is unclear as to whether it was made, completed, and released. In 2008, he was quoted as saying that Canada was a great place to make a first film, but \\"a hard place to keep things going.\\" =Project in development= Shebib's son Noah \\"40\\" Shebib is the executive producer of his father's latest film, NightTalk, which stars Al Mukadam and was in postproduction as of February 2020. Television Shebib earned critical acclaim and a Canadian Film Award for Good Times, Bad Times, made for the CBC in 1969. Another television film, The Fighting Men (1977), was later given a theatrical release. The director's later television work has included By Reason of Insanity (1982), Slim Obsession (1984) both made for the CBC series For the Record and sold to overseas markets, and the television movies The Climb (1986), The Little Kidnappers (1990) and The Pathfinder (1996). In the 21st century, the Gilbert and Sullivan documentary A Song to Sing-O (2007) was well received. Drama series work has included The Edison Twins, Night Heat, Counterstrike and The Zack Files. Philosophy and aesthetics In 1970, Shebib said that his personal philosophy was influenced by television and the Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan. His views were also shaped by competitive sport, playing Canadian football for twenty-seven years until shoulder injuries forced him to quit in 1981, reflecting a decade later about the \\"purity about athletics\\", where it is not possible \\"lie\\" to oneself or to others and get away with it. He professes not to believe in good and evil, only actions that are either \\"efficient or inefficient\\". Shebib still watches Turner Classic Movies \\"religiously\\", and after John Ford, his favourite directors are Frank Capra, William Wellman, Howard Hawks, Marcel Carn√©, David Lean (\\"especially his early stuff\\") and F.W. Murnau (\\"Sunrise is one of my favorite films\\"): > These films made from 1930 to 1934, the Pre-Code films, are among the best > Hollywood films ever made. People always think 1939 was the sort of glory > year of American film. Actually I'd say it was 1933. The films made before > the code were infinitely superior. He said he approved of a few contemporary Canadian feature filmmakers, but found CBC film dramas \\"just dreadful\\" and \\"boring\\", dismissing them as \\"silly stories of girls growing up in the prairies, while as the same time he found the broadcaster's \\"tape dramas\\" were still \\"wondeful, they still have that expertise\\". In 2011, Shebib told Geoff Pevere he had expanded his range of Hollywood cinematic viewing from watching only films up to 1950 to films made as late as and even later than 1950, but contended that movies mainly \\"went in the toilet\\" after 1950 (with some notable exceptions like Stanley Kramer's The Defiant Ones, a \\"perfect movie\\" made in 1958). His dislike for the styles (and subjects) employed by contemporary films is matched by his \\"seething disdain of critics\\" and a \\"testy\\" ambivalence with respect to the quality of his own work (he called himself \\"lazy and sloppy\\" in the execution of his work): Pevere's assessment: \\"Shebib is an old-fashioned traditionalist adrift in a modernist cultural movement, and therefore as much an outsider as anybody he'd make movies about.\\" His feelings of ambivalence extend to a \\"reluctance to accept being the designated representative of Canadian anything\\": \\"I don't like the idea of suddenly being used as a model for Canada or something. Why take me - whatever my feelings are - and blame that on the Canadian people?\\" Style and technique In 1973, Shebib said that an independent filmmaker must become involved in all aspects of the filmmaking process. Restating this in a 1982 interview, he noted that few filmmakers were capable of directing, writing, and editing the same film, and that, as a Canadian commercial filmmaker, he believed his own taste was more in tune with that of the general public than other \\"intellectual\\" filmmakers who were making \\"pretentious\\" and \\"dull\\" films. Shebib believes in the John Ford style of cinematic storytelling. In 1993, he said that conflict is essential to a film and should be inherent to the basic sructure, and should be present in every scene, every change of scene, of a film: \\"Conflict is one of the basic essences of humanity.\\" Recurring themes and socio-political views The director's own youth as an \\"outsider\\" is particularly reflected in the early short films: \\"every one of Shebib's two dozen films has studied the shades of yet another caste of society's disbarred... who never quite make it to their place in the sun.\\" Geoff Pevere remarked that almost without exception, the documentary shorts dealt with \\"isolated individuals or groups existing on the periphery of mainstream society\\", sometimes as a lifestyle choice as in Surfin' and Satan's Choice (1966), but also as \\"a forced condition dictated by an unfeeling, ungrateful society\\", referencing Good Times, Bad Times and the later We've Come Along Way Together, \\"a poignant, compassionate exploration of old age in a world busting its ass to stay young and beautiful.\\" In the mid 1970s, Peter Harcourt remarked on the frequent moments of silence denoting introspection in Shebib's films, both in the early documentaries and in the feature films, a \\"feeling of emptiness, of restlessness, often of irrelevance\\". Shebib places great value on \\"male comradeship\\" and \\"the need of real challenges to give individuals a sense of their dignity\\". Piers Handling noted that Shebib was so preoccupied with male bonding that women were absent from his work prior to the start of his feature film career, and likewise identified a tension between the desire to transcend boundaries and existential limits. Sam Weisberg asserts that all of his films share a common interest in, and empathy with, the extraordinary aspirations of ordinary people,\\" whether \\"goofy teenagers\\" trying to make it as a rock band (Rip-Off), a \\"bored businessman\\" who takes up jogging (Second Wind), or an Italian prisoner of war \\"itching to climb Mount Kenya\\" (The Ascent). Shebib still considers himself a sociologist at heart, and suggests his films have a strong sociological basis, incorporating social commentary, human relationships being a frequent theme. However, he never considered himself an intellectual: he \\"didn't talk like one\\"; not that he was anti-intellectual, just \\"anti-bullshit\\": politically \\"liberal\\" but not laissez-faire or \\"bleeding heart\\", and with \\"socialist leftist leanings\\", but believing that Marxism is \\"just another form bullshit\\", not that capitalists were \\"any better\\". His attitude towards the women's liberation movement seems to have alienated \\"a lot of people\\" in the 1970s: > I really believe that there's a stronger and more definitive drive in man. > Men are the great creators, and I think creativity is a function of sexual > drive. Men and women are different for justifiable reasons to begin with. > Many women in the women's lib movement are confusing the inherent > differences and those we are conditioned to. Critical assessment and influence John Hofsess remarked in 1971 that Shebib's documentary style, developed over five years, is \\"suffused with a wry, ironic humanism\\", a \\"superb style for needling the sacred cows of the establishment and the sanctimonious bull of counter-culture groups\\" a style often maintained even in Shebib's second dramatic feature, Rip-Off. Sandra Gathercole found it impossible to overstate his significance as \\"one of the few English Canadian filmmakers whose work illustrates what is meant by indigenous, rather than derivative, Canadian films ‚Äì films with a character, integrity and identity that are the backbone of any hope we have for an autonomous Canadian industry.\\" As late as 1993, Goin' Down the Road still had \\"legendary status\\" and as of the Toronto International Film Festival's most recent poll of greatest Canadian films, is ranked 6th. It had done more than any other work to advance the Canadian film industry at the time of its release. Within a few years, Shebib's body of work had made him a \\"unique and recognizable film presence\\" in Canada and beyond, \\"verging on international stature.\\" Scholar Katherine A. Roberts remarks how, since the release of Shebib's film, \\"numerous Canadian filmmakers have sought to explore the mobility/masculinity nexus as it relates to landscape and the national narrative.\\" Sam Weisberg opines that, with the exception of Between Friends (1973), none of Shebib's feature films made after Goin' Down the Road have quite the same resonance. Despite his artistic vision and technical skills, a perception grew that Shebib was \\"his own worst publicity agent\\", complaining regularly that his scripts were weak or else that he had difficulties with actors. By 1993, after having directed eight feature length dramatic films, around thirty documentaries, and \\"scores of TV dramas and series\\" over twenty- five years, Shebib was finding it hard to find work, even in television: \\"People have given me the reputation of being terrible-tempered on the set, of being hard to work with. But I don't know where that comes from, I'm really the softest guy in the world.\\" When Geoff Pevere interviewed him in 2011, then aged 73, he found Shebib \\"generous, courteous, and thoughtful\\", but he had certainly not mellowed: \\"He can't help himself, even if it has cost him dearly in professional terms.\\" In 2017, Shebib was presented with a Directors Guild of Canada Lifetime Achievement Award. Legacy=Don Shebib Collection In 1999, the TIFF Reference Library in Toronto received \\"records created by Shebib and his collaborators,\\" consisting of \\"script drafts and occasional production records\\" ranging in production date from \\"circa 1969 to 1994.\\" Personal life=Pastimes Shebib surfed while he lived in Los Angeles, and continued to play football until 1981 when he had to stop due to shoulder injuries, nevertheless remaining active: he played golf and rock climbed, still able to train enough in 1993 to make the mountain climbing film, The Ascent, for which he climbed up to 15,000 feet. In 2011, Shebib said of his hobbies and sporting life that he was \\"a very serious, obsessive person. If it isn't golf it's football or it's stamp collecting. And I was a serious airplane model maker.\\" Marriage and children Shebib married Canadian actress Tedde Moore, whom he met through a mutual friend. They no longer live together, though Moore remains \\"very fond\\" of Shebib and calls him her \\"life partner.\\" 40, in 2019 Their two children Noah and Suzanna are both involved in the performing arts: Suzanna began her career an actress, while Noah, better known as OVO Sound's \\"40\\", an actor and music producer (the siblings have an older half-sister, Zoe). Suzanna is now a chemistry teacher at Toronto's Central Technical School. Friendships and connections Shebib met his lifelong friend Carroll Ballard, with whom he often collaborated, while attending classes at UCLA. In a 1982 interview, he said that Ballard was one of the few contemporary filmmakers he admired. Shebib attended classes at UCLA with Francis Ford Coppola and worked with him on Dementia 13. He also \\"hung out\\" with Jim Morrison during this period, and one summer Beach Boys guitarist Al Jardine stayed with him and his roommates, sharing a love of Gilbert and Sullivan musical numbers. On his return to Toronto, Shebib met and befriended writer and editor William Fruet when he began working for the CBC on The Way It Is.

Under the Canadian constitution, provinces are responsible for the delivery of health care, while the national Canada Health Act ensures access to universal health care for all citizens of the country. The plan covers medically required services provided by a physician enrolled with MSP; maternity care provided by a physician or a midwife; medically required eye examinations provided by an ophthalmologist or optometrist; diagnostic services, including x-rays and laboratory services, provided at approved diagnostic facilities, when ordered by a registered physician, midwife, podiatrist, dental surgeon or oral surgeon; dental and oral surgery, when medically required to be performed in hospital; and orthodontic services related to severe congenital facial abnormalities. MSP claims processing system is integrated with a web-based telecommunications system, Teleplan. Teleplan is used by practitioners to securely submit from over 4,200 computer sites their claims, notes and eligibility requests to MSP, and receive payment statements, rejected claims and patient eligibility data from MSP through an encrypted Internet connection. Teleplan receives and processes over 5 million claims monthly, valued at approximately $116 million. Approximately 95% of all claims are processed within 30 days, with the majority being paid within 14 days. Billing software is developed for these sites by over 80 software vendors who are registered with MSP. An association called Medical Software Vendors Association (MSVA) is formed by the major vendors to work with MSP for ongoing specifications and method changes. Teleplan was started in late 1980s, went through many specification and technological changes and is MSP's main gateway of medical claim information. As of April 2005, Health Insurance BC is the new name for administrative operations of the Medical Services Plan (MSP) and PharmaCare, including Fair PharmaCare. On 16 September 2016, Michael de Jong, Minister of Finance for British Columbia announced that the government will spend $500 million on housing affordability, while also canceling the planned increase in MSP premiums and possibly increase Welfare rates.https://thetyee.ca/News/2016/09/16/BC-Liberals-Bulging-Wallet/ See also *British Columbia Ambulance Service *E-Comm, 9-1-1 call and dispatch centre for Southwestern BC *Emergency Social Services *HealthLink BC *List of emergency organizations in British Columbia References External links  * Medical Services Plan of British Columbia Category:Health in British Columbia ","title":"Medical Services Plan of British Columbia"},{"id":"4445881","text":"Niort Rugby Club (, formerly known as Stade Niortais Rugby) is a rugby team based in the city of Niort (population approx. 70,000) in the Deux-S√®vres d√©partement in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region.

He played in Major League Baseball for the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers and Kansas City Royals. He features a mid ninety mile per hour fastball and throws sidearm.  Professional career =Early career Moylan began his professional career in the Minnesota Twins system. He was released in 1998 and returned to Australia, taking a job as a pharmaceutical salesman.Twitterview with Peter Moylan, by Steve Berthiaume, 10 June 2011. Moylan eventually improved his pitching and began working on a comeback. Moylan broke out while playing for the Australian team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic. He was selected for that tournament following his strong showing in the 2006 Claxton Shield. His 96 mph fastball enabled him to strike out established major-leaguers Bobby Abreu, Marco Scutaro, Ram√≥n Hern√°ndez and Magglio Ord√≥√±ez. Based on his performance in this tournament, Moylan was invited to participate in spring training prior to the 2006 season with the Atlanta Braves.  Atlanta Braves  Moylan with the Braves in 2007 Moylan was signed by the Atlanta Braves in 2006 and assigned to their Triple-A Richmond club. On 11 April 2006, Moylan was called up to the Braves to replace Joey Devine in the bullpen and he made his MLB debut the following day, pitching one scoreless inning against the Philadelphia Phillies; however he was later sent back to the Richmond club. He pitched in 15 total games during three separate call-ups in 2006, with a 4.80 ERA in 15 innings. At the end of spring training in 2007, Moylan was again assigned to Richmond, but he was quickly called up on 14 April due to the injury of pitcher Chad Paronto. Moylan sealed a permanent spot on the roster as he proved invaluable to the Braves bullpen in 2007. Moylan earned his first major league win against the Florida Marlins in Miami on 24 April 2007. He earned his first major league save three days later against the Colorado Rockies in Denver. He finished the season 5‚Äì3 with a 1.80 ERA. He led the majors in intentional walks allowed, with 12. In April 2008, The Braves placed Moylan on the 15-day disabled list with a sore right elbow. Medical examination showed the ulna collateral ligament in Moylan's right elbow was compromised by a bone spur. On 5 May, Moylan was transferred to the 60-day disabled list, and missed the remainder of the 2008 season recovering from Tommy John surgery. Moylan exceeded rehabilitation expectations and was declared fit to pitch during the Braves' 2009 Spring Training camp in Orlando, Florida. Moylan worked with former Braves closer Gene Garber to work on his side-arm/submarine delivery.What ever happened to Gene Garber? He used the spring work to continue to gain arm strength, and began the season on the Braves active roster. After a few shaky appearances in April, Moylan began to find more consistency during May, settling into his role as the team's primary 7th inning specialist. Between the 80 appearances he made in 2007 and the 87 appearances in 2009, he became the first Braves pitcher to have two seasons with 80 or more games pitched. In addition he did not allow a home run in 2009, setting a Major League Baseball record for the most consecutive appearances to start a season without giving up a home run, eclipsing the record of 73 set by Brian Shouse with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2007. Moylan appeared in 85 games for the Braves in 2010, finishing with a 6‚Äì2 record and a 2.97 ERA. In 2011, Moylan appeared in seven games before being placed on the disabled list in mid-April. He underwent successful back surgery on 17 May 2011, and was expected to miss at least two months. Moylan returned to the Braves on 3 September 2011, but after six appearances, he was diagnosed with torn rotator cuff and labrum in his pitching shoulder. Although he was initially expected to miss most or possibly all of 2012, it was later estimated that he would need six-month recovery period, allowing him to be ready for spring training in 2012. While with the Braves, Moylan gained a reputation as a fan favorite through his embrace of Twitter and his sense of humor, even posting a link to a photo of himself in a dress stating he was wearing it to the ESPYs. On 17 January 2012, the Braves re-signed Moylan to a minor-league deal worth approximately $1 million. He only appeared in eight games with the Braves in 2012.  Los Angeles Dodgers  On 16 January 2013, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed Moylan to a minor-league deal and he was assigned to the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes. He was recalled to the Dodgers on 31 May. He appeared in 10 games with the Dodgers and was then optioned back to AAA on 29 June. In 38 games with the Isotopes, he was 4‚Äì1 with a 2.74 ERA. He returned to the Dodgers when rosters expanded on 1 September, where he appeared in four more games. Overall, he was 1‚Äì0 with a 6.46 ERA in 14 games for the Dodgers. The Dodgers designated him for assignment on 22 October 2013. He elected free agency on 29 October 2013.  Houston Astros  On 4 December 2013 Moylan signed a minor league contract with the Houston Astros. He was released on 26 March 2014.  Return to Atlanta Braves  On 5 March 2015 Moylan signed a 2-year minor league deal with the Braves that included a spring training invite for 2016. The deal also made Moylan a player/coach in the Braves minor leagues in 2015 as he rehabbed from his second Tommy John surgery. On 16 August 2015, Moylan's contract was selected by the Braves after posting a 3.14 ERA and 6 saves in 27 games in AAA Gwinnett. On the same day, Moylan made his first major league appearance since 2013.  Kansas City Royals  On 23 January 2016, the Kansas City Royals signed Moylan to a minor-league deal. He was released by the Royals on 28 March, and re-signed two days later.Royals' Peter Moylan: Signs minor league deal Accessed 31 March 2016. On 17 February 2017, the Kansas City Royals re-signed Moylan to a minor- league deal. He joined the Melbourne Aces of the Australian Baseball League as a pitching coach for the winter season after the 2017 season. Third stint with Braves Moylan re-signed with the Atlanta Braves on a one-year contract on February 19, 2018. On February 28, 2019, he retired from Major League Baseball.

They were primarily infantry swords, although they were also regulation pattern for some other officers such as surgeons and staff officers. The term ‚ÄúGothic hilt‚Äù is derived from a perceived similarity between the curved bars of the guard and the arches found in Gothic architecture. They were elegant aesthetically pleasing weapons, although they were considered by some to be mediocre fighting swords.Robson, Brian: Swords of the British Army, The Regulation Patterns 1788 to 1914, Revised Edition 1996, National Army Museum The weapon and its variants had a very long service life.Three Gothic hilts They were replaced ultimately by the 1897 pattern British infantry officer's sword, first having the 1822 pipe-back blade replaced by the 1845 fullered blade, then the 1845 type blade replaced by a new thrusting blade in 1892 and then receiving a new steel hilt in 1895, which was then updated slightly in 1897. Private purchase Although infantry sergeants' and cavalry troopers' swords were issued by the army, officers were expected to purchase their own equipment. In theory they were required to purchase a sword which conformed to an official pattern, however some regiments had their own peculiarities and some allowed their officers some leeway in specification, so there are variations between individual pieces. Also, minor differences between individual manufacturers' examples exist, partly due to their own unique interpretations of the specification for the weapon. Lastly, officers could in fact purchase a blade of their own choosing if they cared to, so long as it looked more or less regulation when worn in the scabbard. Therefore, the precise length, curvature and width of blades varies between examples, with a small number of officers choosing entirely different types of non-regulation blade. Companies like Wilkinson of Pall Mall sold officers' swords in a variety of lengths, curves, widths and styles, while all conforming more or less to the basic regulations for each branch of the service. 1822 pattern infantry officer‚Äôs sword The 1822 dress regulations mandated the introduction of a new sword, to replace the 1803 flank officer's sabre and the spadroon bladed 1796 line infantry officer's sword. The sword featured a 32.5 inches (826mm) long, slightly curved blade of what was known as the 'pipe- back' design, a cross-section sometimes referred to as 'key-hole' shape in Victorian sources. This consisted of a flat, un-fullered, single edged blade with a nearly straight rod running along the back of the blade, with a 'false- edge' being formed on the back edge near to the tip, sometimes described as a 'quill-point'. This style of blade seems to have been the innovation of the maker Prosser of Charing Cross, London, and first appeared on 1796 light cavalry style blades from around 1810‚Äì1815. This cross-section was then translated to the new narrower 1822 infantry officers' sword. The 1822 blades generally featured acid etched decoration showing the monarch's monogram and other devices. The pipe-backed blade is very light for its size and has a very fine edge. The gilded brass, 'half-basket' hilt featured the characteristic Gothic outline, with the monarch's monogram formed in the guard. The hilt had an ornate one piece pommel and 'backstrap' enclosing the end and back of the grip, held in place by a ribbed brass ring at the top of the grip and a tang nut or peened rivet at the end of the pommel. The inside section of the guard folded on a hinge towards the blade, to allow the sword to rest easily against the wearer's side when worn. The wooden grip was covered in shark skin, known as shagreen, to give a textured surface for a secure grip, and this was wrapped with brass, copper or silver twist-wire in the recesses of the ribbed grip. Although the pipe/rod reinforcing at the back edge of the blade was intended to add rigidity for the thrust and strength/mass for the cut, the blade was rather flexible and light at the centre of percussion when made in the infantry sword size. The half basket guard gave better protection to the hand than its predecessor, the 1796 pattern, however the brass could be fragile on some examples, as illustrated by many surviving examples having damage or repairs. Later in the 19th century, it was noted in many articles on British military swords (including the lecture of John Latham of Wilkinson swordmakers in 1862) that these brass guards were vulnerable to hard blows from strong cutting swords such as Indian tulwars. 1845 pattern infantry officer‚Äôs sword In 1845, the pipe backed blade was replaced by Henry Wilkinson's design. This was a slightly curved cut-and-thrust blade, generally of the same length of the previous pattern, however the new blade featured a single, wide fuller and a flat back, rather than the pipe back, with a symmetrical spear-point rather than the quill-point. In essence it was a curved backsword blade with an improved point. It was a slightly heavier and more robust blade than the 1822 pipe-back. This new blade was also carried over onto cavalry, engineers and artillery officer's swords in 1845 and to naval officer's swords in 1846. The hilt remained essentially unchanged from the 1822 pattern, although there was a tendency for brass guards after 1845 to be made somewhat thicker and more robust than previously. The hinged guard flap, which had been standard (if not universal) from 1822, started to disappear in the 1850s, to be replaced by a solid brass guard almost universally after around 1860. This change to the hilt is sometimes referred to as the '1854 pattern', but it was not technically a 'pattern' and the change seems to have happened at the end of the 1850s generally. Therefore, there is no actual '1854 pattern' other than the Foot Guards sword (details below). Wilkinson were still making infantry officers' swords with folding inner guards until 1859 as standard and do not seem to have switched to universally solid guards until 1860. The 1845 blade remained the same. Direct comparison of the 1822 and 1845 blades shows that the new weapon was an improvement, being stiffer in bending and compression. It had a more robust edge, was a little heavier, had more mass in the centre of percussion and the symmetrical spear-point is much better at penetrating. The blade is better therefore at cutting, thrusting and guarding. Contemporary views on the new blade were favourable and it was almost universally adopted within a year. It was also adopted and embraced by experienced combat officers ordering fighting swords who could have chosen any type of private purchase blade (for example Major Hodson and Brigadier-General Jacob both chose this blade type for their custom fighting swords, which survive in the National Army Museum and Royal Armouries respectively) and it was emulated by various foreign militaries. Original sharp examples and replicas perform well in cutting tests, easily equalling other backsword and sabre types. During the period of the 1845 blades use on infantry officers' swords, from 1845 to 1892, it has been observed that blades tended to get straighter. This is a general tendency, but was not universal. One can find early examples with straighter blades and later examples with more curved blades. The curvature varied, though it is fair to say that more straight examples seem to appear from later dates. The width of the blades were usually 1 and 1/8 inch, but some examples were only 1 inch wide, and again these narrower ones tend to be later in date. Again this is a general tendency and not a rule. 'Piquet' or dress weight examples were made with much narrower blades and correspondingly smaller hilts. The standard length of these blades was 32.5 inches, but again there was variation, with officers basically being allowed to order whatever length best suited them. Most surviving examples are 32.5 to 34.5 inches. Thickness or mass of blades also varied and different examples can feel quite diverse in the hand. Some are balance to be better cutters while others make better thrusting swords. Comparison of the 1822 \\"pipe-backed\\" and 1845 \\"fullered\\" blades 1892 pattern infantry officer's sword The 1845 sword enjoyed a long service life and was used successfully in colonial wars all over the world, often winning the praise of British soldiers who used it to defend their lives. However, in 1892 proponents of the theory that thrust should be used exclusively over cutting for swords prevailed and the cut and thrust blade was replaced by a straight dedicated thrusting blade with a thick, fullered, dumbbell section and a very acute narrow tapered point. Unburdened by the design compromises of a requirement to cut well, this was a triumph of academic theory over real world experience, but was generally well received (Robson reports on its good performance against the Dervishes in the Sudan. It was during the Sudan campaign when a young Winston Churchill sheathed his (cavalry) sword before the charge and used his then shockingly modern Mauser Broomhandle semiautomatic pistol). The 1892 blade is difficult to compare to the 1845 blade using historical accounts, because after 1892 there were comparatively far fewer encounters where swords were actually used. In 1895 the brass Gothic hilt was replaced by a steel hilt for line infantry officers, featuring a totally new design of both the guard and the handle. This was married to the 1892 thrusting blade to create an entirely new sword. Accompanying this was a new Sword Exercise system of 1895, promoted by Colonel Fox of the Army Gymnasia and devised by Maestro Masiello of Florence. Steel gothic-hilted swords In 1827, officers of the rifle regiments (considered somewhat of an elite) were authorised to carry their own variation of the sword. The blade was that of the 1822 pattern sword (changing, along with the line infantry, to a fullered blade in 1845). The hilt was of the Gothic pattern but in steel with the crown and stringed bugle motif of the light infantry replacing the royal cypher. The steel guards were often less well rendered than that of the brass hilts. There was no folding flap. The pattern is still current for the light infantry regiments. In 1854, the regiments of the Foot Guards were also permitted to carry a steel hilted sword. This featured a similar hilt to the rifle regiments, but with the regimental badge in place of the stringed bugle. In 1854 and 1855 therefore, many officers of the Foot Guards replaced their brass-hilted infantry officers' swords with new steel-hilted versions. This steel hilt is still the regulation pattern for Foot Guards officers to the present day, although with the 1892 thrusting blade rather than the 1845 sabre blade which they had featured until 1892. Variations Sergeants' swords were similar to those for officers, but generally had undecorated blades with a shorter ricasso. Some sergeants' swords featured a quill-point rather than the spear-point found on officers' swords. Many sergeants' swords were made by Mole of Birmingham and some by Thurkle of London. Some sergeants' swords feature a brass grip instead of the usual shark skin grip. Staff officers throughout most of the period carried a brass hilted sword like the normal line infantry officers' sword, but with the crossed baton staff symbol in place of the royal cipher. Generals carried the same sword as their staff, until they were formally replaced by a Mameluke style sword in 1831. Some infantry officers who would have generally carried the brass-hilted sword elected to have a hilt made of steel, which was then gilded to look like the normal brass hilt. This of course made for a much stronger guard and this feature is often found among swords ordered by British officers with experience of Indian service. Lastly, as noted above, officers were given considerable freedom in choosing the exact details of the blades being mounted in regulation style hilts, so long as their swords looked approximately regulation when worn.

He was appointed Surveyor General of Ireland in 1559 by Queen Elizabeth I of England, later being appointed Auditor of the Exchequer. He was elected Member of Parliament for Berwick-on-Tweed in 1571, Thetford in 1572 and for Berwick again in 1586. He was also a member of the Privy Council during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Berwick As victualler and treasurer of Berwick he was involved in diplomacy and negotiations during the Scottish Reformation and the Marian civil war.

Ireland In July 1584, the English government commissioned a survey of the lands of Munster, following the Desmond Rebellions. Browne was appointed to this task, whose purpose was to facilitate the plantation of Munster. In a letter to Lord Burleigh dated 10 October 1584, he said that \\"the work was so difficult as to have extended over three years.\\" He then wrote from Askeaton that he had \\"travailed hard in superintending the survey, passing through bogs and woods, scaling mountains, and crossing many bridgeless rivers and dangerous waters,\\" waters in which he lost some of his horses, and was twice nearly lost himself; that his son had broken his arm, and that \\"the service was so severe that many of the men had fallen sick.\\" He described the towns and villages as ruined, and wrote that \\"not one of thirty persons\\" was left alive after the famine caused by crop destructions, and \\"those for the most part starvelings\\".Making Ireland British by Nicholas Canny Desmond's lands, thus void of inhabitants, were, however, \\"replenished with wood, rivers, and fishings\\". Sir Valentine's companion, Henry Wallop, expressed more optimism for English prospects in the region. Browne‚Äôs survey resulted in the now untenanted lands being divided into 35 lots; he himself was granted of land in County Kerry alone, in addition to earlier grants in Hospital, County Limerick. He erected a castle nearby, called Kenmare Castle, and in 1585 was MP for County Sligo in the Irish Parliament. On 28 June 1588, he bought the vast estates of the McCarthy family, including the Lakes of Killarney, from the estate of Donald Maccarty, 1st Earl of Clancare. He died in 1589 and was buried in St Catherine‚Äôs Church, Dublin, on 19 February 1589. Family and children He is the ancestor of the Earls of Kenmare. The sons of his second marriage (to Thomasine, daughter of Robert Bacon) became landed proprietors in Munster whilst the son of his first marriage (to Alice or Elizabeth, the daughter of Robert Alexander) became High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1593. He also married Ellice Fitzgerald, daughter of Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond. His son Sir Nicholas married Sheila, a daughter of Eoin the O'Sullivan Beare, who had lost his chieftainship to his nephew Donal Cam O'Sullivan Beare who had claimed a right to it by primogeniture. Unlike most of the English settlers following the Reformation, the Brownes soon reverted to the Catholic faith. Although they can hardly be said to have become Gaelicised, they were at least sufficiently identified with the old Gaelic aristocracy to be coupled with the great Irish families in a 17th-century Irish poem eulogising the old order.

Early life Moran was born in Nashville, Tennessee to an Irish Protestant family. He played football for the University of Tennessee in 1897, but left after one year to go to Bethel College, where he coached football as well as playing the sport. Moran coached the University of Nashville football team in 1900 and 1901. The 1901 team was one of the South's greatest. Baseball Moran played minor league baseball in 1902 for teams in Little Rock, Chattanooga and Dallas. In 1903, Moran pitched for the National League's St. Louis Cardinals, who finished in last place, but he appeared in only three games (plus another as a shortstop) before injuring his arm. He posted a 5.25 earned run average in his brief tenure of 24 innings, being charged with a loss without earning a win, but also batted .429. He went back to the minor leagues to manage the Dallas Giants in 1904, and continued playing with teams in Galveston (1905), Waco and Cleburne (1906), Grand Rapids (1906‚Äì07) and Savannah (1908). The 1906 Cleburne team won the Texas League championship. He returned to the Cardinals as a catcher in 1908 and played in 21 games, batting .175 as the team again finished last. His minor league career continued with teams in Milwaukee, Mobile, New Orleans, Dallas and Montgomery until he suffered a broken leg in 1912. He briefly played with teams in Chattanooga and Brunswick in 1913 before retiring as a player. After managing an Austin team in 1914, he began umpiring, in the Texas League in 1915‚Äì16 and the Southern Association in 1917. Coaching and officiating=Texas A&M; Moran began coaching football in 1909 at Texas A&M;, where he accumulated a 38‚Äì8‚Äì4 record as head coach over six seasons through 1914. Note: This may be incorrect as he was elevated to head coach after the second game of the 1909 season. Carlisle He then became an assistant to Pop Warner at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1915. National League umpire He became a National League umpire in 1918, a job he held through the 1939 season. He officiated in four World Series (1927, 1929, 1933, and 1938), serving as crew chief on the last two occasions. He was behind the plate on May 8, 1929, when Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants pitched an 11‚Äì0 no- hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Centre Moran also resumed his career as a football head coach in 1917 at Centre College, where he had a 42‚Äì6‚Äì1 record in five seasons. He had previously been working as an assistant coach at Carlisle, and had visited Centre to see his son Tom‚Äîlater an NFL player with the New York Giants‚Äîplay; after helping the team prepare for an important contest he was offered the head coaching job by the school. The first two games of the 1917 season were coached by Robert L. \\"Chief\\" Myers, and the rest by Moran. According to Centre publications, \\"Myers realized he was dealing with a group of exceptional athletes, who were far beyond his ability to coach. He needed someone who could do the team justice, and found that person in Charles Moran.\\" His record included undefeated seasons in 1919 and 1921, when the team was led on the field by Hall of Fame quarterback Bo McMillin. On October 29, 1921, Moran guided Centre College to a historic 6‚Äì0 upset of Harvard, which had been unbeaten the previous two seasons. The game, commonly abbreviated \\"C6-H0\\", was ranked the 3rd biggest upset in college football history by ESPN.ESPN ranks 1921 Centre-Harvard game among college football's greatest upsets During the 1921 season Moran began a friendship with future baseball commissioner Happy Chandler, who was then a player on an opposing Transylvania University team. Bucknell Moran then moved to Bucknell University, where he had a 19‚Äì10‚Äì2 record from 1924 through 1926. Frankford Yellow Jackets He was co-coach with Ed Weir of the NFL's Frankford Yellow Jackets in 1927, but left after the team managed only a 6‚Äì9‚Äì3 season.

It is decorated with an elaborate frontal in green, a colour typically associated with the seasons after Epiphany and Pentecost. An antependium (from Latin ante- and pendƒìre \\"to hang before\\"; pl: antependia), also known as a parament or hanging, or, when speaking specifically of the hanging for the altar, an altar frontal (Latin: pallium altaris), is a decorative piece, usually of textile, but also metalwork, stone or other material that can adorn a Christian altar. Specifically, and as the etymology of the word suggests, an antependium hangs down in front of whatever it covers, and is to be distinguished from the altar linens which are used in the service of the Eucharist, and an altar cloth which covers the top of the altar table (mensa). Types of antipendia Romanesque gold antependium, once set with gems, c. 1200-1225. Western Christianity \\"Antependium\\" is the word used for elaborate fixed altar frontals, which, in large churches and especially in the Ottonian art of the Early Medieval period, were sometimes of gold studded with gems, enamels and ivories, and in other periods and churches often carved stone, painted wood panel, stucco, or other materials, such as azulejo tiling in Portugal. When the front of an altar is elaborately carved or painted, the additional cloth altar frontal normally reaches down only a few inches from the top of the altar table; this is called a \\"frontlet\\". In other cases it may reach to the floor (the \\"frontal\\", properly so called). In both situations, it will usually cover the entire width of the altar. A \\"Jacobean frontal\\" will cover the entire altar, reaching down to the floor on all four sides.

London: Oxford University Press; p. 530 Covers for lecterns and pulpits are generally similar to a frontlet, normally covering the \\"desk\\" of the lectern or pulpit and handing down about a foot or longer in front (visible from the congregation). Eastern Christianity Russian Orthodox priest standing in front of a fully vested altar (D√ºsseldorf, Germany). In the Orthodox Church, the Holy Table (altar) may be covered with one or two coverings. There is always an outer frontal, covering the top of the Holy Table and hanging down several inches on all four sides. This kind is used alone if the front of the Holy Table is elaborately carved or decorated. For a \\"fully vested\\" Holy Table, a second, inner hanging is used. This covers the Holy Table fully on the top and hangs down to the floor on all four sides. The analogia (icon stands) are covered with a covering known as a proskynitarion. As with the coverings used on the Holy Table, there may, again, be only one outer covering or also a second, inner covering that hangs to the floor (though, in this case, sometimes only in the front and back). Construction A cloth antependium is normally of the same colour and often of the same fabric and similar style as the vestments worn by the clergy. The fabric may vary from very simple material, such as cotton or wool, to exquisitely wrought damasks, fine watermarked silk, velvet, or satin. Embellishment is commonly by means of decorative bands of material called orphreys, embroidery (sometimes in gold or silver thread, or making use of pearls and semi-precious stones) or appliqu√©s, fringes and tassels, all of a complementary colour to the fabric. The most frequently used symbol on both vestments and hangings is the cross. The antependium is normally lined in satin, using a matching hue. Colours Paraments hanging from an Advent wreath in a Methodist church. The colours used tend to be suggested by the liturgical tradition of each denomination. Most Western Christian churches that observe a developed liturgical tradition use white, gold, red, green, violet and black, with each being used on specified occasions. A rose colour may be employed for the fourth Sunday (Laetare Sunday) in Lent and the third Sunday (Gaudete Sunday) in Advent. In Anglican circles, blue is sometimes prescribed for feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary (see liturgical colours), although it is also used, unofficially, in some areas of the Roman Catholic Church. Among Eastern Christians, there tend to be two types of vestments: somber (dark) ones and festal (bright) ones. Beyond that, no specific colours are officially required. Among groups such as the Russian Orthodox Church, a pattern of fixed colours has developed, somewhat similar to that used in the West, although they are not, strictly speaking, required. Other usages Antependium can also be used to describe the front of the altar itself, especially if it is elaborately carved or gilded. The famous Pala d'Oro in St. Mark's Basilica in Venice originated as an antependium, although it is used as a reredos now.

Biography  Marie Sall√© was a prominent dancer and choreographer in early 18th-century dance. She helped to create ballet d'action (a form continued by her student, Jean-Georges Noverre); she challenged the male- dominated theatrical world; she reformed traditional \\"feminine\\" costumes. Born to fairground performers and tumblers in 1707, Marie grew up performing around France with her family. She made her first public performance with her brother, Francis, at London‚Äôs Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre in 1716. They made their Paris debut at the Saint Laurent fair in 1718 performing La Princesse Charisme, created by V√©ronique Lesage. In 1725, their family returned to England, but they stayed. The pair is said to have studied with Claude Balon, star of the Paris Op√©ra, as well as his partner, Fran√ßoise Pr√©vost, and fellow dancer at Paris Opera, Michel Blondy. They spent two more seasons at Lincoln's Field Inn, performing dances from George Frideric Handel's opera Rinaldo as well as pantomimes. Sall√© went solo and started performing with the Paris Opera in late 1727. In her premiere, she performed in Jean-Joseph Mouret's Les Amours des Dieux. She danced alongside Marie Camargo, also a student of Pr√©vost; however, they each formed different approaches to their dancing ‚Äì Camargo as the technician and Sall√© as the actress. Her legacy never quite separated from Camargo despite their differing styles. Sall√© never settled in at the Paris Opera as she left three times after conflicts with the administration. Nevertheless, she left her mark there, especially during her collaboration with Jean-Philippe Rameau.Ed. Selma Jeanne Cohen and Dance Perspectives Foundation. \\"The International Encyclopedia of Dance\\"(1998), Oxford University Press, published online: 2005, She continued to London in 1734 for her fourth season. She was engaged by John Rich to perform at Covent Garden. She danced in \\"Terpsicore,\\" a prologue to a revision of Handel's \\"Il pastor fido,\\" and in the premieres of the same composer's \\"Alcina\\" and \\"Ariodante.\\" Also In 1734 she presented her first original, and almost famous work in 1734, Pygmalion, a mythological tale of a statue that comes to life and the sculptor who creates it. This piece made her the first woman to choreograph a ballet in which she also danced. In Pygmalion, Sall√© chose to dress in Greek robes, wear her hair down and dance in sandals while playing the role of the statue in an attempt to make it a more realistic characterization. According to Susan Au, her choreography \\"gave the impression of a danced conversation\\" (Ballet and Modern Dance 32). During this season, Covent Garden also saw her pantomime Bacchus and Ariadne and her collaboration with Handel. She returned to Paris in 1735 and choreographed and danced in scenes for Jean-Phillipe Rameau‚Äôs op√©ra-ballets. She retired from the public stage in 1741. However, she continued to dance at court (i.e. to the request of royalty for them and the nobility at court). She taught at the Op√©ra- Comique in 1743 and, according to her student Jean-Georges Noverre, she practiced daily. Sall√© came out of retirement for a few performances at Versailles between 1745-47. She died on June 27, 1756. Private life and public image The theatrical scene in 18th-century London and Paris was male- dominated and unreceptive to change. It was the men who held the influential positions in courts and theaters, who were the artists, and women were only seen as able to interpret what the men had created. Marie Sall√©, not only an expressive dancer but also a noteworthy choreographer, challenged these boundaries given to women. However, despite being one of the first women to stage and dance in her own original productions in London and Paris opera houses, her achievements received overwhelmingly negative feedback if any at all compared with her male counterparts. This disparity occurred mostly likely because ‚Äì as Christine Battersby theorizes ‚Äì male writers consciously excluded women from their definitions of creative potential. Sall√©‚Äôs accomplishments in her early years were translated by the male-dominant theatre space into reflections of her virtuosity and proper femininity. She was often described as having a ‚Äúvirginal image,‚Äù earning her the nickname of ‚ÄúLa Vestale,‚Äù referencing the vestal virgins of Rome who were the only women excused from having male guardianship. In fact, Nicholas Lancret, in 1732, painted a portrait of Sall√© as the virgin goddess, Diana, further cementing Sall√©‚Äôs public virtuous image in her early years. Images of the rose also followed her after her role in Jean-Philippe Rameau‚Äôs Les Indes Galantes in 1735. In contrast, Sall√© also gained a reputation of being highly sensual with a mysterious private life. In dancing, she was described as the goddess of Grace and Voluptuousness, but this alternate image clashed with one of virginity and virtuosity, creating this tension that critics and public spectators struggled to reconcile. As a result, Sall√©‚Äôs pure public image began to deteriorate, replaced by one of sexual predilection and scandal. After Sall√©‚Äôs return to Paris in 1735, rumors began to spread of an affair between her and Manon (Marie) Grognet, a dancer and colleague Sall√© had met in London. At this time, Sall√© was in her mid-thirties and had no heterosexual attachment, thus, the public speculated that colleagues of hers may have used her abstinence as a cover for her casual affairs. However, all rumors and publications on Sall√©'s sexual or romantic activity had no tangible evidence. Battersby theorizes that the controversial perception of her private life probably was related to the fact that, at the time, Sall√© was experiencing success as a choreographer. Sall√© retired at the age of thirty-three. Interestingly, once removed from the public gaze, she disappeared from the writings of her contemporaries as well. What written documentation remained after her retirement alluded once again to the virginal image of her early years. In her later life, Sall√© lived in \\"domestic contentment\\" with an Englishwoman, Rebecca Wick, whom she named as her \\"amiable amie\\" five years prior to her death, when bequeathing her estate to Wick as her sole heir.Ballerina: Sex, Scandal, and Suffering Behind the Symbol of Perfection, by Deirdre Kelly; Greystone Books Ltd; 2014, p. 34. Costume Reform Marie Sall√© ‚Äì Maurice Quinton de la Tour Although mainly a choreographer and performer, Sall√© also laid the foundation for an influential new wave of costume reform in dance history spearheaded by her pupil, Jean- Georges Noverre, in the late 18th century. Sall√© introduced audiences to the idea of the rejection of masked dancers and vouched for the importance of dance and performance to mimic real life, including the costumes. She argued that costumes should reflect and represent the character, a novel idea at the time. This engendered a sense of \\"realism\\" that had been largely ignored up to this point in the evolution of ballet and also allowed for greater physical freedom among the female dancers, unburdening them of the restrictions of unwieldy and elaborate clothing onstage. This ideology of rejecting masks and realism mimicry was quickly picked up by Noverre and emphasized in his later works such as Letters. Unfortunately, Sall√©‚Äôs costume innovations were seen as overly radical and were rejected by French critics of her time. The culture and bureaucracies of dance in France in the eighteenth century were restrictive, thus it was common for dancers to turn to courts elsewhere for freedom to develop personal expressions of art. London in particular attracted many budding dancers as their lack of state patronage directly contrasted with France‚Äôs strict bureaucracies regulating dance practices, and Sall√© was one of these dancers. London audiences proved to be more accepting of innovation in dance, and Sall√©‚Äôs pantomime acting abilities fit well within the liberal climate of London audiences. There, she was able to choreograph and perform in arguably her most famous production, Pygmalion. Sall√©‚Äôs appearance onstage in her production without a pannier, or a skirt that was the typical expectation of women‚Äôs costumes in her time, roused shock from French contemporaries and critics, who were appalled that she dared appear onstage without a skirt, headdress, or even a corset. Despite this negative feedback, Sall√© continued to push her desires for realism in costuming, presenting what Sarah McCleave describes as one of Sall√©‚Äôs boldest costuming reform attempts in Handel‚Äôs Aleina. There, she performed in what the Abb√© Pr√©vost later labeled as ‚Äúmale attire‚Äù that went against the feminine image typical of dancers in the eighteenth century. Sall√© changed the traditional costuming from heavy long dresses to muslin-flowing material which caused shock and delight. She often performed without a skirt or bodice (sans-paniers), rebelling against the traditional costume and accepted gender norms of a very regimented era. Critiques of Sall√©‚Äôs costume reforms ultimately returned back to the strong patriarchal authority in the theatre sphere, where the dominant male voice imposed expectations of female grace and docility and criticized the female creators that strayed from this definition of femininity. Yet, Sall√© was able to slowly gain respect for herself and her work despite the strong criticism by collaborating with influential composers such as George Frideric Handel and Christoph von Gluck, commissioning compositions from them for her choreography.thumb thumb See also * Women in dance ReferencesFurther reading * McCleave, Sarah. \\"Marie Sall√©, a Wise Professional Woman of Influence‚Äù Women‚Äôs Work: Making Dance in Europe before 1800, Lynn Matluck Brooks (Ed.), University of Wisconsin Press, 2007, pp. 160‚Äì 181. * Schmidt, Carl B. \\"Dance (opera)\\", Grove Music Online ed L.

He is married to Oƒæga Feldekov√°. Feldek is the author of several books of poetry (Kriedov√Ω kruh, Paracelsus, and Milovanie pred usnut√≠m), the novel Van Stiphout, and several plays including Teta na zjedenie or J√°no≈°√≠k podƒæa Vivaldiho. He translates works of modern world poets (Alexander Blok, Vladimir Mayakovsky, or Guillaume Apollinaire) as well as classical plays (such as those by Sophocles and William Shakespeare). He has also written a couple of books for children, most notably the Modr√° kniha rozpr√°vok and Zelen√° kniha rozpr√°vok illustrated by Alb√≠n Brunovsk√Ω. According to the Index Translationum statistics, he is among the top ten most translated authors writing in Slovak language. In January 1989 he protested against the arrest of V√°clav Havel and signed a political manifesto A Couple of Sentences. During the Velvet Revolution he closely cooperated with the movement Public Against Violence, which transformed itself into a political party later on. Feldek vs. Slobodn√≠k and Feldek vs. Slovakia  In 1992, Feldek publicly noted that \\"Du≈°an Slobodn√≠k became Minister of Culture and his fascist past immediately came to light\\", referencing to his involvement in an SS training course as a teenager (at the age of 17) in Sekule at the time of the First Slovak Republic. The statement was published shortly after the appointment of a new Government, following the 1992 parliamentary elections, in which Slobodn√≠k became a minister. Feldek has also written the poem Dobr√∫ noc, m√° mil√°, containing the verse \\"eses√°k sa objal s e≈°t√©b√°kom\\" (an SS man gave a hug to an STB agent), referencing to the disputed past of both Du≈°an Slobodn√≠k and Prime Minister Vladim√≠r Meƒçiar. Slobodn√≠k sued him for defamation, and after losing at the Municipal Court in Bratislava, a senate consisting of three Supreme Court members voted in his favor. Feldek was obliged to apologize and pay 250,000 SKK. Although the senate of appeal of the Supreme Court abolished the financial penalty, Feldek's defendant Ernest Valko brought the case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. In 2001, in the Feldek vs. Slovakia case, the court ruled that freedom of speech was breached. Feldek was awarded damages amounting to 500,000 SKK. Feldek and his family moved to Prague in 1995, but he himself moved back to Bratislava several years later.

Design Designed by Gunnar Birkerts, it was home to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 1973 to 1997 (hence, many people refer to it as \\"the old Federal Reserve building\\"). Designed much like a suspension bridge, most of the original floors are supported by two sets of catenary cables. Underground chambers were used for vault space, and an external elevator shaft was attached on the east face of the building to connect a ground-floor lobby with the rest of the building. There was originally a gap between the lobby and the rest of the above ground structure to emphasize the construction method. Southwest view of Marquette Plaza in its original configuration with aboveground gap While the building's design has been highly praised as an engineering achievement, it was plagued with design defects that led to leaky windows and other problems. In addition, asbestos had been heavily used in the building's construction. The Minneapolis Federal Reserve decided to build a new complex a few blocks away rather than renovate the structure, and it passed to private hands. The building was remodeled in 2002 for about US$65 million, a process which included adding office space to the east side and into the aboveground gap, while also converting a concrete plaza into a grassy park. A skyway connection was added to the ING ReliaStar 111 Building. Early designs for the building included sketches for an addition on top that included an inverted catenary, resulting in a shape resembling an oval. The building is credited with influencing the decision to add an observation bridge with a catenary arch above the dramatic opening in Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Centre. Local design company Ellerbe Becket contributed to the work for that structure. Notable tenants Major tenants after the move have included telecommunications companies that made use of the vault space. The Minneapolis Public Library's central location had also been temporarily located there while waiting for the 2006 completion of a new building a block away. Re-emergence Marquette Plaza re-established its iconic status in 2011 as it became the first downtown Minneapolis building to earn LEED Platinum certification. This status, granted by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), is the most prestigious and challenging level of LEED certification to achieve and illustrates the building‚Äôs transformation and leadership in the greening of downtown. Marquette Plaza made its mark as the first large multi-tenant building in Minnesota to receive Platinum certification, due to a rigorous series of efforts and implementations set forth by property manager Base Management and 23 building tenants, which include: The Scoular Company, Federal Government agencies, Foley & Mansfield, Meet Minneapolis and CenturyLink. Platinum certification is more challenging to receive when multiple tenants are involved in the process. The sustainability consultant that helped Marquette Plaza attain LEED Platinum certification was Sustology, a Minneapolis-based sustainable developer and consultant with its headquarters in Marquette Plaza. The property was up for recertification ins 2016 and again attained LEED Platinum status with the help of consultant Sustology and is currently the only LEED Platinum Certified building in Minnesota as of 2016.

Kaye served on the city council from 1830 to 1832 and took office on March 15, 1837. He was elected by the city council, and was the last mayor to be chosen this way, which was proving to be very controversial and difficult (it took 13 ballots before Kaye was chosen in 1837). In 1838, the state legislature amended the city charter to allow for direct election, and also extended terms from one year to three, but prevented incumbents for running for re-election.

Although Work had strongly opposed point count methods for 25 years, beginning about 1927 he became a strong advocate of the 4-3-2-1-¬Ω point count‚Äîso much so that it became known as the Work Point Count. Subsequently, his employee and disciple Charles Goren adapted it to value all hands. It is still used by players today.

The station is owned by Mars Hill Broadcasting, utilizing programming from the Mars Hill Network, and broadcasts at 4.7 kilowatts ERP from a rental tower in Clifton Park, New York which is owned by Fitch Communications of New York (FCNY) and shared with WKKF and WTMM-FM. The station has been assigned several call letters over the years, including the heritage WPTR calls (longtime of 1540 AM and briefly on 96.3 FM); it has also aired various formats, including three attempts at oldies, as well as the first full-time Contemporary Christian music station in the Capital Region. It was also the first station to broadcast in HD Radio in the market in 2005, preceding WGY by several months. History What is now WDCD- FM first signed on in March 1987 as WCSF, airing a Saratoga County-targeted oldies format, even though the signal covered the main cities of the Capital District well. In one of the first of the high ticket purchases that set the now astronomical prices for Albany stations, WCSF's ownership sold the station to WV Communications of Schenectady. WCSF-FM was the first oldies station on the FM dial in the Capital Region, and was moving up in the ratings when sold to WV. WV Communications already owned WWWD, an AM station in neighboring Schenectady. In September 1987, WWWD and WCSF joined in a rock-based CHR simulcast, with WWWD becoming WVKZ and WCSF becoming WVKZ-FM. The two stations would later split off for most of the day, with 96.7 taking the \\"KZ-96.7\\" branding. KZ-96.7 shifted to album-oriented rock in 1989, and then to a harder current-based rock format in 1990, now known as \\"Power Rock KZ-96.7\\". In 1991, it returned to CHR as \\"Power Hits KZ-96.7\\". Changes in CHR music as a genre, coupled with a glut of CHR stations in the Albany market, led ownership to change WVKZ-FM to an early hot adult contemporary format in 1992 as WWCP-FM (Capital 96-7). Though set apart from several rival stations and a mild success, financial problems led to the sale of WVKZ to Capital OTB (the regional off-track betting agency) and that of WWCP-FM to Jarad Broadcasting, owners of famed Long Island station WDRE, a move done in part due to the large amount of Long Island expatriates and college students in the Albany area. On Memorial Day weekend, 1994, several months after closing on WWCP-FM, Jarad Broadcasting launched the WDRE-based Underground Network, a progressive- leaning alternative rock format. Though a critical success in lieu of being a networked format, the format did not attain any ratings success, and on some occasions, nearly did not show in quarterly ratings. Making things even more difficult was the flip to alternative rock of WQBK-FM/WQBJ in 1995, as well as the consistent ratings of local hard rock Z-Rock affiliate WZRQ. These difficulties led Jarad to break from the network in late 1995, and flipped WWCP-FM to oldies as WXXO. With no FM oldies station in the market, the station entered the top 10 in its first book; however, this success would be short-lived as Jarad began to sell its non-Long Island holdings. Early in 1996, Jarad found a buyer in WDCD owner Crawford Broadcasting, which took WXXO over that March and began a simulcast of WDCD's Christian talk format. That July, the calls changed to WDCD-FM; the format remained on the 96.7 frequency after WDCD split off and flipped to adult standards, reclaiming its heritage WPTR calls, at the start of 2000. On March 16, 2004, WDCD and WPTR swapped formats and calls with 96.7 flipping to adult standards. This format served merely a placeholder, as on July 15 of that year, the station flipped to Contemporary Christian, branded as Pulse 96-7. Increased competition from the K-LOVE (AC) and Air 1 networks led the station flipping back to classic hits, as \\"Legends 96.7\\" (a branding the station previously used during its adult standards incarnation) on February 1, 2011, at midnight, duplicating that of sister station WLGZ-FM in Rochester, New York. Former logo of Legends 96.7, 2011 However, the \\"Legends\\" format was short-lived as the station returned to Christian talk, once again simulcasting AM 1540 on November 11, 2011, and changed to the WDCD-FM call letters; the simulcast branded as \\"New Light 96.7,\\" emphasizing the FM frequency. Effective July 25, 2019, the station was sold to Mars Hill Broadcasting for $600,000, and switched to Mars Hill Network programming. The station simultaneously changed its call letters to WMHH.

It has the auspice of conceptual art and is commonly a form of performance art. It is associated with the Viennese Actionists, the Dada movement and Neo-Dadaists. Stuckists have made extensive use of it to affect perceptions of artworks they oppose and as a protest against existing interventions. Intervention can also refer to art which enters a situation outside the art world in an attempt to change the existing conditions there. For example, intervention art may attempt to change economic or political situations, or may attempt to make people aware of a condition that they previously had no knowledge of. Since these goals mean that intervention art necessarily addresses and engages with the public, some artists call their work \\"public interventions\\". Although intervention by its nature carries an implication of subversion, it is now accepted as a legitimate form of art and is often executed with the endorsement of those in positions of authority over the artwork, audience, or venue/space to be intervened in. However, unendorsed (i.e. illicit) interventions are common and lead to debate as to the distinction between art and vandalism.\\"Incidents of art vandalism\\" cabinetmagazine.org. issue 3. Retrieved March 22, 2006 By definition it is a challenge, or at the very least a comment, related to the earlier work or the theme of that work, or to the expectations of a particular audience, and more likely to fulfil that function to its full potential when it is unilateral, although in these instances, it is almost certain that it will be viewed by authorities as unwelcome, if not vandalism, and not art. Authorised There are many art interventions which are carried out in contexts where relevant invitation and approval has been given. Detroit MONA goes kaBOOM!, 2002 The extreme to which an authorised intervention can go and yet still meet with institutional approval was shown in 2002, when the Museum of New Art in Detroit staged a show kaBoom!, with the announcement, \\"Over the course of the exhibition, museum visitors will be invited to smash, drop, throw and slash artworks...\\"Announcement of kaBOOM!

At one of their shows, visitors were invited to smash the exhibits with an axe. Hanging Old Masters backwards, 2004 A more usual authorised art intervention in an institution is done with great care to make sure that no harm comes to the existing collection. In 2004, the Old Town House in Cape Town, South Africa, hung its Michaelis Collection of 17th century Dutch Old Master paintings facing the wall. The curator Andrew Lamprecht said this exhibition, titled Flip, \\"would force gallery goers to reconsider their preconceptions about the art and its legacy.\\" Knowledge of intent is integral to such a process, as it would be perceived differently if it were announced in a conservation context, rather than as an art piece. However, in this instance there was some ambiguity about the purpose of the exercise as Lamprecht, although stating, \\"I'm asking questions about the history,\\" also added a more standard \\"educative\\" comment, \\"the reverse of the paintings revealed a wealth of detail not normally on view to the public, ranging from old attempts to preserve the canvas to notes from different collectors over the years,\\"\\"Old Masters to Be Hung Facing the Wall\\", The Guardian, August 4, 2004 Retrieved March 4, 2006 thus lessening the confrontational impact of his actions. An equestrian statue of Lord Napier wrapped in red tape by Eleonora Aguiari in 2004. Lord Napier in red tape, 2004 An authorised art intervention which required considerable effort to gain the requisite permission was the wrapping in red duct tape of the equestrian statue of Lord Napier of Magdala, situated on Queen's Gate in West London. This was done by Eleonora Aguiari, a Royal College of Art (RCA) student for her final show. When questioned as to whether she had considered a clandestine act, she replied, \\"No, not my style, I like to challenge the institutions.\\" In order to do this she needed clearance letters from the RCA Rector, a professor, the Victoria and Albert Museum conservation department and the RCA conservation department, bronze tests, a scaffolding license, indemnity insurance, and permission from English Heritage (who own the statue), the City of Westminster, two Boroughs (Chelsea and Kensington, as their boundary bisects the length of the horse) and the present Lord Napier. Then a layer of cling wrap and almost 80 rolls of red duct tape were applied by 4 people working for 4 days. Aguiari described it as \\"a Zen action up there in the middle of traffic, but alone with a beautiful statue. Every detail on the statue is perfect and slightly larger than normal,\\" and said that \\"statuary that symbolizes military past, or imperialism should be covered to make the topics of the past visible.\\" \\"The Red Tape of Red Tape,\\" arcroyal.co.uk Retrieved March 22, 2006 Aguiari then received a phone call: \\"Saatchi wants to talk to you,\\" but, on keeping the appointment, she found herself talking not to Charles Saatchi but to Michael Moszynski of the advertising firm, Saatchi & Saatchi, who thought her idea would be suitable for \\"a Tory advertising campaign,\\" and wanted her to wrap an ambulance in red tape.

An artist poured black ink into it, and was subsequently prosecuted, at Hirst's wish. The artist's defence was that he thought Hirst would benefit from the publicity and one critic (Tony Parsons) said the artist's action proved that what Damien Hirst does is art. The exhibit was restored at a cost of ¬£1000. Two men jump naked into Tracey's bed, 1999 A notable case of an unauthorised intervention--which did no damage, yet was still liable for prosecution--occurred at 12.58 p.m. on October 25, 1999, when two artists, Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi, jumped on Tracey Emin's installation My Bed, in the Turner Prize at Tate Britain, wearing only underwear. They called their performance Two Naked Men Jump Into Tracey's Bed. They were arrested for their action, but no charges were pressed. Chai had written, among other things, the words \\"ANTI STUCKISM\\" on his bare back. They said they were \\"improving\\" Emin's work, because they thought it had not gone far enough, and opposed the Stuckists, who are anti-performance art.\\"Satirists Jump into Tracey's Bed\\", The Guardian, October 25, 1999 Retrieved March 22, 2006 Banksy, c.2000 Photo of \\"Banksy\\" art in Brick Lane, East End. 2004. \\"Banksy\\" is the operating name of one of the best-known interventionists in the UK.

Lennie Lee, c.2005 In February 2005 Jewish artist, Lennie Lee, was censored for exhibiting a piece called \\"Judensau\\" (Jew pig) in Treptow Town Hall gallery, Berlin. The intervention was organized by the other artists working in the show who claimed (incorrectly) Lee was one of them. Lee's work was designed to put the institution in a difficult position. If they left it on the wall they would be accused of anti-semitism by their opponents. On the other hand, if they took the work down, they would be censoring the work of a Jewish artist dealing with antisemitic stereotypes. The authorities were forced to take the piece down. The piece attracted considerable attention from the media. Lee offered to remove his \\"Judensau\\" on condition that a 14th-century sculpture of a \\"Judensau\\" was removed from the side of Martin Luther's church in Wittenberg. \\"Uproar in town hall Treptow\\" Morgen Post online.

Pinoncelli, who was arrested, said the attack was a work of performance art that Marcel Duchamp himself would have appreciated.Pierre Pinoncelli on BBC website This may be true, as on one occasion visitors to a Dada show were invited to smash up the exhibits with an axe. Previously in 1993, Pinoncelli urinated into the piece while it was on display in N√Æmes, in southern France. Both of Pinoncelli's performances derive from neo-Dadaists' and Viennese Actionists' intervention or manoeuvre. The Fountain attacked by Pinoncelli was actually number 5 of 8 recreated by Duchamp at a much later date, after the original one was lost. Another is on display in the Indiana University Art Museum, and there is one also in Tate Modern, where in 2000 it too was the target of a urination performance (unsuccessful according to the gallery) by Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi.

Illicit confronts the approved Although the legal technicalities are straightforward, when an unauthorised intervention intervenes in an officially sanctioned one, the moral issues may be far less straightforward, especially when the legal act meets with widespread public disapproval (even to the point of considering it vandalism), while the illicit reaction to it satisfies a public sense of justice. Occupying private land as art without permission In Wellington, New Zealand (Jan. 1978) Barry Thomas illegally occupied a central city site that had lain vacant for 2.5 years, becoming an \\"eyesore site\\" in the local media. Thomas planted 180 cabbage seedlings in the shape of the word cabbage and called it \\"Vacant lot of cabbages\\". It was soon added to by many other creative interventions - this political/\\"site/event specific\\" work lasted 6 months and ended with a week-long festival to promote native forest restoration. The work encouraged large amounts of public participation and with the media became known as the \\"Soap box art corner\\" \\"Post Duchamp we had to take the readymades and art back - out for real world walks\\" (Thomas) http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2012/11/02/vacant-lot-of-cabbages-documentation- enters-te-papas-archives/. String up the perpetrator, 2003 In spring 2003, artist Cornelia Parker intervened in Auguste Rodin‚Äôs sculpture The Kiss (1886) in Tate Britain by wrapping it in a mile of string.\\"No Strings Attached\\" The Guardian Retrieved March 22, 2006 This was a historical reference to Marcel Duchamp's use of the same length of string to create a web inside a gallery. Although the intervention had been endorsed by the gallery, many people felt it offensive to the original artwork and an act of vandalism rather than art. This reaction then prompted a further, unauthorised, intervention, in which Parker's string was cut by Stuckist Piers Butler, while couples stood around engaging in live kissing. \\"String up the Perpetrator\\" A Stuckist on Stuckism Retrieved March 22, 2006 Sticking it to Goya, 2003 In 2003, Jake and Dinos Chapman montaged clown and other \\"funny\\" faces onto a set of etchings of Goya's The Disasters of War (which they had purchased), thereby intervening in the original work. Aside from complaints on the grounds of bad taste, this act was described by some as \\"defacement\\", although the set was a late 1930s printing. Ostensibly as a protest against this piece, Aaron Barschak (who later became famous for gate-crashing Prince William's 21st birthday party dressed as Osama bin Laden in a frock) threw a pot of red paint over Jake Chapman during a talk he was giving in May 2003. The Chapmans then added monster heads to Goya's Los Caprichos etchings and exhibited them at the White Cube in 2005 under the title Like a dog returns to its vomit. Like other interventionists they asserted this was an improvement on the original: \\"You can't vandalise something by making it more expensive.\\" However, Dinos pointed out one problem: \\"sometimes it is difficult to make the original Goya etchings any nastier; in one I found a witch sexually molesting a baby.\\".\\"Frieze Show Puts the 'Art' into Party, The Guardian, October 23, 2005 Throwing something at boxes, 2006 Interventionist with object at the Jonathan Meese performance at Tate Modern.

Duchamp, 1917 A seminal example of this approach took place in 1917 when Marcel Duchamp submitted a urinal (laid on its back, signed by him \\"R.Mutt 1917\\", and titled Fountain) to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition. The Society had proclaimed their open- mindedness by stating they would accept all work submitted, only anticipating that conventional media (paintings) would be. Duchamp was a member of the Society's board, and interpreted the regulations at face-value. His entry was immediately rejected as \\"not being art\\", and he resigned from the board shortly after. The original Fountain was lost. Fifty years later, Duchamp commissioned reproductions, which were then highly sought by museums.Wikipedia article on Fountain Retrieved March 26, 2006 In 1961, fellow Dadaist, Hans Richter, wrote to Duchamp: :You threw a bottle rack and urinal in their faces as a challenge and now they admire them for their aesthetic beauty.

On one occasion they were given an award for conceptual art by the proto-MU group nevertheless. Art or vandalism? It is claimed that the legitimacy and artistic value of an art intervention may vary, depending on the perception and standpoint of the viewer. The following statement, entitled Stuckism Handy Guide to the Artworld, first appeared on the Stuckist website with specific reference to the Meese incident at Tate Modern, and was then posted by Jennifer Maddock on the Artforum board with the comment, \\"I found a pretty cynical attempt to differentiate between vandalism and intervention while I was reading about the event in Tate Modern, for example the Stuckists' cynical definition\\":Artforum discussion forum Sometimes art vandalism is used to make a political protest. Whether this is or isn't regarded as a legitimate political act, it is not normally seen as art, nor until recently would the question have even arisen. However, with the increasing dissolution of boundaries between art and life, and the broadening of art's scope, there has been an increasing tendency to view unusual or spectacular actions as art, even though the actions were never intended as art. Damien Hirst and 9/11, 2002 Public outrage followed one attempt to reclassify an event in art terms on September 10, 2002, the eve of the first anniversary of the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks, when Damien Hirst said in an interview with BBC News Online: :The thing about 9/11 is that it's kind of like an artwork in its own right ... David Hockney said that it was the 'most wicked piece of artwork'--a lot of people have compared it to a work of art. Of course, it's visually stunning and you've got to hand it to them on some level because they've achieved something which nobody would have ever have thought possible --especially to a country as big as America.

History In 1939, a citizen‚Äôs committee led by the Altoona Chamber of Commerce Chairman at the time convinced Ralph D. Hetzel, president of the Pennsylvania State College, to support an undergraduate center in Altoona. In July, the citizen‚Äôs committee launched a campaign to raise money to renovate an abandoned grade school building to house the new center. More than $5,000 was raised from 8,000 local contributors in two months. The college opened its doors to just 119 freshmen and nine faculty members. By 1946, it was clear that the campus population was going to continue to grow and expansion of the campus was imminent. The purchase of the 38 acres of the defunct Ivyside Amusement Park was made for $40,000. The park had been closed in 1944 due to \\"the war and gas rationing.\\" Properties in the surrounding areas were continued to be purchased totaling over 100 acres by the 1990s. In September 1948, the official relocation was made to Ivyside; this era of the college was dubbed that of \\"Bathhouse U,\\" a name that referred to the conversion of the former amusement park's bathhouse into \\"offices, classrooms, laboratories, and [the] library.\\" By 1950, Steven Adler was hired as the Registrar \\"indicating the enrollment and campus growth was significant enough that someone needed to focus on those issues\\". In 1955 the college introduced Associate degrees in Electrical Engineering and Drafting and Design. Sixty-eight years later, Penn State Altoona numbers keep growing, with more students graduating each spring. Penn State Altoona offers internships, research programs and study abroad programs along with continuing education and training. Students can complete their degrees at Penn State Altoona or transfer to another Penn State location.

History Founded as the DuBois Center of the Pennsylvania State College in 1935, the first classes were held in the Hubert Street School by four full-time and one part-time faculty. In 1937, the DuBois School Board and the family of city founder John E. DuBois endowed the Center with a four-acre campus including the original DuBois family mansion and stables. Extensive renovations were carried out on the Tudor-style mansion and grounds by the Works Progress Administration, and classes began in \\"The Mansion\\" February 1938. In 1942, the curriculum of standard undergraduate courses was expanded to include a summer semester \\"Accelerated Program\\" and evening adult classes to train defense specialists for the World War II War Effort.http://www.ds.psu.edu/Information/ourhist.htm In 1945, the DuBois Educational Foundation was incorporated to raise funds for campus growth. Following World War II, an influx of GI Bill veterans increased the student body, and throughout the next decades several new buildings were constructed to accommodate the continued growth. In 1959, the Pennsylvania State University formally integrated its \\"Centers\\" as \\"Commonwealth Campuses\\" and the \\"DuBois Undergraduate Center\\" officially became the DuBois Campus. Penn State DuBois serves the higher educational needs of the relatively rural surrounding area, and is an important educational resource for the entire DuBois region, including Clearfield, Jefferson and Elk Counties. Academics Currently serving 900 students, Penn State DuBois offers 9 associate and 6 bachelor's degree programs which can be completed entirely on site. The first two years of an additional 160 majors can be started at DuBois, with students matriculating to the Penn State University Park Campus to complete their degrees.

The campus serves students from the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania covering a five-county area that includes all or parts of Fayette, Greene, Somerset, Washington, and Westmoreland counties. The campus also enrolls students from other states and maintains a small international student population. Students at Penn State Fayette can complete the first two years of most of majors available in the Penn State system along with the entirety of six bachelor's degrees and eight associate degree programs. History Penn State founded an education center in the area in 1934, as part of an initiative to provide localized learning facilities that could grant associate degrees or allow students to complete the first two years of a bachelor's degree without the expense of living in University Park. However, the center was closed in the 1940s due to World War II. In the 1950s, the commonwealth campus system was established and local branch campuses, each fully integrated into the Penn State system, were established across the state. Fayette Campus opened in 1965. It was first housed in rented space in downtown Uniontown before relocating to its current site three years later. In 2004, the campus was named for Robert E. Eberly, a wealthy Pittsburgh natural gas speculator who endowed his fortune to Western Pennsylvania higher education. Academics Class sizes average between 20 and 25 students and the largest classes on campus are typically no larger than 60 to 75 students. Students at Penn State Fayette can complete the first two years of nearly all 160+ majors offered throughout the Penn State system.

The system is composed of a federal and many separate state, territorial, and local jurisdictions, with states and the federal government sharing sovereign police power under the common authority of the United States Constitution. The juvenile justice system intervenes in delinquent behavior through police, court, and correctional involvement, with the goal of rehabilitation. Youth and their guardians can face a variety of consequences including probation, community service, youth court, youth incarceration and alternative schooling. The juvenile justice system, similar to the adult system, operates from a belief that intervening early in delinquent behavior will deter adolescents from engaging in criminal behavior as adults. History and background=Pre-1900 Juvenile delinquency punishments trace back to the Middle Ages when crimes were severely punished by the Church. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, few legal differences existed between children and adults. Children as young as six and seven years were considered productive members of the family and their labor contributed to family income. In court, children as young as seven were treated as adults and could receive the death penalty. Early debates questioned whether there should be a separate legal system for punishing juveniles, or if juveniles should be sentenced in the same manner as adults With the changing demographic, social, and economic context of the 19th century resulting largely from industrialization, \\"the social construction of childhood...as a period of dependency and exclusion from the adult world\\" was institutionalized. This century saw the opening of the first programs targeting juvenile delinquency. Barry Krisberg and James F. Austin note that the first ever institution dedicated to juvenile delinquency was the New York House of Refuge in 1825. Other programs, described by Finley, included: \\"houses of refuge\\", which emphasized moral rehabilitation; \\"reform schools\\", which had widespread reputations for mistreatment of the children living there; and \\"child saving organizations\\", social charity agencies dedicated to reforming poor and delinquent children. These 'child-saving efforts' were early attempts at differentiating between delinquents and abandoned youth. Prior to this ideological shift, the application of parens patriae was restricted to protecting the interests of children, deciding guardianship and commitment of the mentally ill. In the 1839 Pennsylvania landmark case, Ex parte Crouse, the court allowed use of parens patriae to detain young people for non-criminal acts in the name of rehabilitation. Since these decisions were carried out \\"in the best interest of the child,\\" the due process protections afforded adult criminals were not extended to juveniles. Early 1900s The nation's first juvenile court was formed in Illinois in 1899 and provided a legal distinction between juvenile abandonment and crime. The law that established the court, the Illinois Juvenile Court Law of 1899, was created largely because of the advocacy of women such as Jane Addams, Louise DeKoven Bowen, Lucy Flower and Julia Lathrop, who were members of the influential Chicago Woman's Club. The Chicago court opened on July 1, 1899 with Judge Tuthill presiding, along with several members of the Chicago Woman's Club who acted as advisors about the juvenile offender's backgrounds. Establishing a juvenile court helped reframe cultural and legal interpretations of \\"the best interests of the child.\\" \\"The underlying assumption of the original juvenile system, and one that continues to prevail, was that juveniles were generally more amenable to rehabilitation than adult criminals. This new application of parens patriae and the development of a separate juvenile court formed the foundation for the modern juvenile justice system. 1960s to 1980s The debate about morality and effectiveness surrounded juvenile courts until the 1950s. The 1960s through the 1980s saw a rise in attention to and speculation about juvenile delinquency, as well as concern about the court system as a social issue. This era was characterized by distinctly harsh punishments for youths. There was also a new focus on providing minors with due process and legal counsel in court. Criticism in this era focused on racial discrimination, gender disparities, and discrimination towards children with mental health problems or learning disabilities. While still recommending harsher punishments for serious crimes, \\"community-based programs, diversion, and deinstitutionalization became the banners of juvenile justice policy in the 1970's\\". However, these alternative approaches were short lived. The rising crime rates of the 1960s and media misrepresentation of this crime throughout the 1970s and 80s, paved the way for Reagan's War on Drugs and subsequent \\"tough-on-crime\\" policies. Heightened fears of a 'youth problem' \\"revealed white, middle- and upper-class anxieties about growing social unrest and the potential volatility stemming from social and economic inequality\\". Public perception of juvenile deviance was such that at the 1999 Juvenile Justice Hearings, Bill McCollum claimed \\"simply and sadly put: Today in America no population poses a larger threat to public safety than juvenile offenders\\". In the late 1980s, the United States experienced a large increase in crime, and juvenile crime was brought into public view (Juvenile delinquency in the United States). Americans feared a \\"juvenile super-predator\\", and this fear was met by the government with harsher policies for juvenile crime. 1990s to present day In the 1990s, juvenile crime ‚Äì especially violent crime ‚Äì decreased, although policies remained the same. Schools and politicians adopted zero tolerance policies with regard to crime, and argued that rehabilitative approaches were less effective than strict punishment. The increased ease in trying juveniles as adults became a defining feature of \\"tough-on-crime\\" policies in the 1990s. As Loyola law professor Sacha Coupet argues, \\"[o]ne way in which \\"get tough\\" advocates have supported a merger between the adult criminal and juvenile systems is by expanding the scope of transfer provisions or waivers that bring children under the jurisdiction of the adult criminal system\\". Some states moved specific classes of crimes from the juvenile court to adult criminal court while others gave this power to judges or prosecutors on a case-by-case basis. Still others require the courts to treat offending youth like adults, but within the juvenile system. In some states, adjudicated offenders face mandatory sentences. By 1997, all but three states had passed a combination of laws that eased use of transfer provisions, provided courts with expanded sentencing options and removed the confidentiality tradition of the juvenile court. Juvenile courts were transformed to more easily allow for prosecution of juveniles as adults at the same time the adult system was re-defining which acts constituted a \\"serious crime.\\" The \\"three strikes laws\\" that began in 1993 fundamentally altered the criminal offenses that resulted in detention, imprisonment and even a life sentence, for both youth and adults. \\"Three strikes laws\\" were not specific to juvenile offenders, but they were enacted during a period when the lines between juvenile and adult court were becoming increasingly blurred. The War on Drugs and \\"tough-on-crime\\" policies like Three Strikes resulted in an explosion in the number of incarcerated individuals. Implementation of the Gun Free School Act (GFSA) in 1994 is one example of a \\"tough on crime\\" policy that has contributed to increased numbers of young people being arrested and detained. It was intended to prosecute young offenders for serious crimes like gun possession on school property, but many states interpreted this law to include less dangerous weapons and drug possession. Many schools even interpreted GFSA to include \\"infractions that pose no safety concern, such as 'disobeying [school] rules, 'insubordination,' and 'disruption\\". These offenses can now warrant suspension, expulsion and involvement with juvenile justice courts. Schools have become the primary stage for juvenile arrest and the charges brought against them and punishments they face are increasing in severity. Today this is frequently referred to as the school-to-prison pipeline. Demographics Demographic information for youth involved in the Juvenile Justice system is somewhat difficult to collect, as most data is collected at state, county, and city levels. Although the office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention publishes national numbers that breakdown the racial make-up of youth involved in the juvenile justice system, this data provides an incomplete picture, as it excludes Hispanic youth in its demographic calculations. A demographic breakdown of youth in the United States. A demographic breakdown of youth involved in juvenile court in the United States. According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, in 2011 there were a total of 1,236,200 cases handled by the juvenile courts. 891,100 cases dealt with males, compared with 345,100 for females. The most prominent age group represented in the courts is 13 to 15 years, which make up 552,000 of the total cases. 410,900 of the cases involved Black adolescents, which represents about one-third of the total court cases. The number of cases handled by the juvenile courts in the United States was 1,159,000 in 1985, and increased steadily until 1998, reaching a high point of 1,872,700. After this point, the number of cases steadily declined until 2011. In the 1,236,200 cases settled in 2011, 60% of the juveniles had a previous background of criminal history in their families and 96% of the juveniles had substance abuse problems, often related to parental/guardian substance abuse. In 1999, juveniles accounted for 16% of all violent crime arrests, and 32% of all property crime. They also accounted for 54% of all arson arrests, 42% of vandalism arrests, 31% of larceny-theft arrests, and 33% of burglary arrests.Listenbee, Robert, Eric Holder, and Karol Mason. OJJDP Annual Report. Washington, DC, 2013. Print. http://www.ojjdp.gov/pubs/241584.pdf Racial discrepancies Since 1995, the rate of confinement has dropped by 41%, and the rate has decreased among all major racial groups in the US. However, disparities by race remain apparent: in 2010, 225 youths per 100,000 were in confinement. When separated by race, there were 605 African-Americans, 127 Non-Hispanic Whites, 229 Hispanics, 367 Native Americans, and 47 Asian/Pacific Islanders in confinement per 100,000. African-Americans are close to five times more likely to be confined than white youths, while Latino and Native Americans are two to three times more likely to be confined than white youths. Racial disparities in confinement are relatively constant across states. According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, females constitute 14% of juveniles in residential placement in 2011. Of these females, 61% belong to racial minority groups. The Annie E. Casey Foundation provides additional information about the demographics of the juvenile justice system. Juveniles in residential placement Residential placement refers to any facility in which an adolescent remains on-site 24 hours a day. These facilities include youth detention centers, group homes, shelters, correctional facilities, or reform schools. According to census data of Juveniles in residential placement and the Annie E. Casey Foundation, the number of youths in juvenile detention centers in the United States has declined in the past two decades. The number of adolescents incarcerated peaked in 1995, with 107,637 in confinement in a single day. In contrast, there were fewer than 62,000 adolescents in residential placement in October 2011. Juvenile offenders are placed either in public facilities operated by the State or local government, or private, for- profit facilities operated by separate corporations and organizations. Private facilities are smaller than public facilities. Half of all juvenile placement facilities in the US are privately operated, and these facilities hold nearly one-third of juvenile offenders. Since 1997, 44 states and the District of Columbia have experienced a decrease in incarceration of adolescents. As of 2010, only 1 in 4 juveniles in confinement were incarcerated as a result of a violent crime (homicide, robbery, sexual assault, aggravated assault). Additionally, 40% of juvenile delinquency cases and detentions are a result of offenses that are not considered threats to public safety. These include underage possession of alcohol, truancy, drug possession, low-level property offenses, and probation violations. The most common age of offenders was 17 years old, with 17,500 in placement in 2011. Juveniles aged 12 and under accounted for 1% of all youth in placement. Criticisms The current debate on juvenile justice reform in the United States focuses on the root of racial and economic discrepancies in the incarcerated youth population. Residual fear from \\"get-tough\\" policies implement harsher practices in schools that perpetuate an unhealthy cycle. The most common is the implementation of zero tolerance policies which have increased the numbers of young people being removed from classrooms, often for minor infractions. Low-income youth, youth of color and youth with learning and cognitive disabilities are over- represented in the justice system and disproportionately targeted by zero tolerance policies. Collectively this creates the school-to-prison pipeline - a phenomenon that contributes to more students falling behind, dropping out and eventually being funneled into the juvenile justice system. Much of the criticism about the American juvenile justice system revolves around its effectiveness in rehabilitating juvenile delinquents. Research on juvenile incarceration and prosecution indicates that criminal activity is influenced by positive and negative life transitions regarding the completion of education, entering the workforce, and marrying and beginning families. According to certain developmental theories, adolescents who are involved in the court system are more likely to experience disruption in their life transitions, leading them to engage in delinquent behavior as adults. Lois M. Davis et al. argue that adolescents are affected by a juvenile system that does not have effective public policies. Currently the juvenile system has failed to ensure that all youth in the system with learning disabilities or mental health issues, and from lower-class individuals and racial minorities are provided with the benefits for a productive life once out of the system. In 2013 30% of youth in system have a learning disability and nearly 50% test below grade level. They argue that the juvenile justice system should be restructured to more effectively lower the chances of future crime among youth, and advocate for increased educational programs for incarcerated youth as the most important method to reduce recidivism. A 12 BC report from The Council of State Governments Justice Center showed only states provide incarcerated youth with the same educational services as the general student population in the United States. The report recommended juvenile detention facilities should be held to the same academic standards as other public schools. Proposed reforms Many scholars stress the importance of reforming the juvenile justice system to increase its effectiveness and avoid discrimination. Finley argues for early intervention in juvenile delinquency, and advocates for the development of programs that are more centered on rehabilitation rather than punishment. James C. Howell et al. argue that zero tolerance policies overwhelm the juvenile justice system with low risk offenders and should be eliminated. They also argue that the most effective ways to reform the juvenile justice system would be to reduce the overrepresentation of minorities and eliminate the transfer of juveniles to the criminal justice system. Zimring and Tannenhaus also discuss the future of the juvenile justice system in the United States. They argue that educational reentry programs should be developed and given high importance alongside policies of dropout prevention. Reentry programs focus on providing care and support to juveniles after being released from detention facilities, and encouraging family support to help adolescents during this adjustment period. They also argue for the elimination of juvenile sex offender registration requirements, and the reform of criminal record information for juvenile offenders. Some popular suggested reforms to juvenile detention programs include changing policies regarding incarceration and funding. One recommendation from the Annie E. Casey Foundation is restricting the offenses that are punishable by incarceration, so that only youth who present a threat to public safety are confined. Other suggestions include investing in alternatives to incarceration, changing economic incentives that favor incarceration, and establishing smaller, more humane and treatment-oriented detention centers for the small number who are confined. Positive Youth Development and the juvenile justice system Positive Youth Development (PYD) encompasses the intentional efforts of other youth, adults, communities, government agencies and schools to provide opportunities for youth to enhance their interests, skills, and abilities. The justice system offers specific services to youth facing significant mental health and substance use challenges, but the majority of youth do not qualify for these targeted programs and interventions. Butts, et al. suggest that the integration of positive youth development into the juvenile justice system would benefit youth charged with nonviolent, less serious offenses. Widespread implementation of PYD approaches in the juvenile justice system faces many challenges. Philosophically however, the PYD framework resembles the progressive era ideals that informed the creation of the first juvenile court. As Butts, Mayer and Ruther describe, \\"The concepts underlying PYD resemble those that led to the founding of the american juvenile justice system more than a century ago. [...] Organizers of the first juvenile courts saw the solution to delinquency in better schools, community organizations, public health measures, and family supports. They believed an improved social environmental would encourage youth to embrace pro-social norms.\\" Integration of PYD into the juvenile justice system is informed by social learning theory and social control theory. Taken together, these theories suggest that \\"youth are less attracted to criminal behavior when they are involved with others, learning useful skills, being rewarded for using those skills, enjoying strong relationships and forming attachments, and earning the respect of their communities\\". This is in stark contrast to the theories of deterrence and retributive justice espoused by the current justice system. Youth court Youth courts are programs in which youth sentence their peers for minor delinquent and status offenses and other problem behaviors. The program philosophy is to hold youth responsible for problem behavior, educate youth about the legal and judicial systems, and empower youth to be active in solving problems in their community. Youth courts function to determine fair and restorative sentences or dispositions for the youth respondent. Youth court programs can be administered by juvenile courts, juvenile probation departments, law enforcement, private nonprofit organizations, and schools. Youth court programs operate under four primary models: Adult Judge, Youth Judge, Peer Jury, and Youth Tribunal Models. Under the adult judge model, an adult volunteer serves as the judge while youth volunteers serve as prosecuting and defense attorneys, jurors, clerks, and bailiffs. Under the youth judge model, youth volunteers fill all roles, including judge. Under a peer jury model, youth jurors question the respondents and make sentencing determinations. Under a youth tribunal model, youth serve as prosecuting and defense attorneys, and present their cases to a panel of youth judges, who then make a sentencing determination. To date, there are no comprehensive national guidelines for youth courts, but rather, courts operate under and are tailored to their local jurisdictions. To date, there are more than 675 youth courts in the United States. East Palo Alto and Boston have both implemented youth courts. The East Palo Alto youth court is based on restorative justice principles. Eligible youth must admit the facts of the case, after which youth attorneys explain the facts of the case to a youth jury.http://www.epayouthcourt.org/About_Us.html East Palo Alto, CA In Boston, youth court is available to first time, low level offenders. It is based on a restorative justice framework. Restorative justice Restorative justice is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of the victims and the offenders, and the involved community, rather than punishing the offender. Victims and offenders both take an active role in the process, with the latter being encouraged to take responsibility for their actions. Doing so is an attempt by offenders to repair the harm they've done and also provides help for the offender in order to prevent future offenses. Restorative justice is based on a theory of justice that views crime to be an offense against an individual and/or a community, versus the state. Programs that promote dialogue between victim and offender demonstrate the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability. Restorative justice practices have been implemented in schools that experience higher rates of violence or crime. This can catch the juvenile before they're involved in the justice system and can change discipline into a learning opportunity. It encourages accountability, supportive climates, appropriate listening and responding and contributes to a development of empathy for the offender. The difference between student exclusion and restorative approaches is shown through not only low recidivism, but school climates. With restorative approaches focusing on relationships, it prioritizes interpersonal connections which creates an overall better community. The underlying thesis of restorative practices is that ‚Äò‚Äòhuman beings are happier, more cooperative and productive, and more likely to make positive changes in their behavior when those in positions of authority do things with them, rather than to or for them.‚Äô‚Äô Raise the age Many advocates argue that the juvenile system should extend to include youth older than 18 (the age that most systems use as a cut-off). Research in neurobiology and developmental psychology show that young adults' brains do not finish developing until their mid-20s, well beyond the age of criminal responsibility in most states. Other non-criminal justice systems acknowledge these differences between adults and young people with laws about drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, etc. New York and North Carolina remain the only states to prosecute all youth as adults when they turn 16 years of age. Connecticut Governor, Dannel Malloy proposed in 2016 raising the age in his state to 20.

It incorporates the Pennsylvania State Forest Academy, founded in 1903 by Governor Samuel W. Pennypacker. Approximately 1,200 students attend the school with more than 30% being over the age of 24. The majority of the student population at Penn State Mont Alto commute to classes, rather than live in the provided residence halls. The campus is well known for its forestry and nursing majors. While many students elect to continue their education at University Park, Penn State Mont Alto does offer four-year degrees in business as well as English. The campus serves additional students through its Continuing Education unit, with courses on campus, and other sites. History= Pennsylvania State Forest Academy Joseph Rothrock, an explorer, botanist and medical doctor founded the academy to train men for service in the state forests. In May 1903, Samuel W. Pennypacker, governor of Pennsylvania, established the Pennsylvania State Forest Academy in Mont Alto. With the precipitous closure of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell in the same month, the new Pennsylvania school became one of three forestry schools in the nation, along with Yale and Biltmore. George Wirt, the academy's first administrator, patterned the curriculum after curricula in Germany. All first year students were required to bring a horse with them to the academy until the late 1920s. The horses were used to fight forest fires in the Michaux State Forest.Penn State Mont Alto: Interesting Mont Alto Facts Penn State Undergraduate Admissions - College as an investment The yearbook of the Pennsylvania State Forest Academy was called \\"The Oak Leaf\\". It was published in 1914, 1920, 1923 and 1927, and may now be viewed online through the Pennsylvania State University Libraries along with other items documenting the history of this campus.  Merger with Penn State  In 1929 the Forest Academy merged with Pennsylvania State University, establishing Penn State Mont Alto. Students were adamantly opposed to the merger, and they protested by hanging two state officials in effigy. The campus closed from 1943 to 1946 because the students and faculty were fighting in WWII. In 1963, Penn State Mont Alto became a Commonwealth Campus. In 1997, Mont Alto joined the Commonwealth College, and began to offer baccalaureate degrees. Campus=Residence halls Penn State Mont Alto offers three residence halls to students: Mont Alto Hall, Penn Gate I, and Penn Gate II. *Mont Alto Hall offers traditional dorm life. All three floors of the building are broken up into an east and a west side, with only one gender belonging to a particular wing. Each room holds two people, although it is possible to obtain a single room given certain circumstances. The rooms are not carpeted, and lack a central AC unit. They do however, include a heater. Each resident is provided with a desk, a phone jack, an Ethernet connection, a dresser, and a closet. The \\"Microfridge\\", a combination microwave and refrigerator, is standard as well. Every wing of the building includes a bathroom that the entire hall shares, making for two per floor. Mont Alto Hall also includes a basement with washers/dryers and study rooms. This hall is a mere 4-5 minute walk from virtually anything on campus, with the exception of the Penn Gate dorms and other parts of the campus east of PA 233 (softball fields, etc.). *Penn Gate II offers four-person suite living. Similar to Mont Alto Hall, the building is three stories tall. While halls themselves are not gender specific, each individual suite is. The four-person suite includes two spacious bedrooms as well as a bathroom that is shared by all four people in the suite. Each room is carpeted and also includes a central air conditioning unit. Penn Gate II is located east of PA 233, and is a fairly long walk (5-10 minute) to campus. *Penn Gate I is a third residence hall offered at Mont Alto. Located directly adjacent to Penn Gate II, Penn Gate I was not in use during the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 school years due to low enrollment. However, it was reopened for the 2006‚Äì2007 school year. Penn Gate I offers a similar four-person suite living accommodation that is provided at Penn Gate II. Classroom buildings *Conklin Hall was originally built as a dormitory by students of the forestry school starting in 1909 and completed in 1911. The building is now home to the Student Center, Student Affairs offices and the archives.history.html *The General Studies Building is where the majority of classes at Penn State Mont Alto are held. The three story brick building includes many traditional classrooms for lectures. The first floor holds an auditorium that is frequently used for special shows and speakers, as well as large lecture classes. In addition to the auditorium, the first floor holds the Learning Center, a place where students can go to study with a professional or student tutor. Several computer labs are held in the building as well. *The Science and Technology building is primarily used for science courses at Penn State Mont Alto. In it, you will find several labs specific to different courses such as chemistry and nursing. Many general education courses are held in this building as well, particularly those with large class sizes. It was built in the 1970s. *The Bookstore has a computer lab in the basement. Classes such as Computer Science and Management & Information Systems are typically held here. Other notable buildings *Wiestling Hall is the primary building on the campus, located in the center of the campus mall. Built in 1803, it is the oldest building in the Penn State system. Originally built as an iron master's house it has served as the campus dining hall, classroom and dormitory. The second floor of Wiestling Hall is home to faculty and staff offices. The third floor of Wiestling has never been renovated, and remains true to the 1803 design. This third floor is only accessible through two hidden entranceways on the second floor of the building. Local legend holds that Wiestling is haunted by a ghost named Sarah and by the ghost of Col. Wiestling, the first ironmaster who lived there. In 2004, Wiestling Hall was modernized and now it serves as the student building and houses the campus Student Government Association office. *History has it that John Brown spent time at Emmanuel Chapel before his raid on Harper's Ferry in 1859. Penn State Mont Alto bought the chapel in 1992 for $1 and reopened it in 1999. *The MAC (Multipurpose Activities Center) is the gym at Penn State Mont Alto. This building sports a few classrooms, a basketball gym, a weight room, a racquetball court, and a multipurpose room used for conferences, dances, and other occasions. Two tennis courts are located outside of the MAC as well. *The library at Penn State Mont Alto includes a variety of books and research databases that serve faculty, staff, and students, as well as members of the local community. Any Pennsylvania resident may borrow items from the Penn State University library system. *The most recent building to be added at Penn State Mont Alto was the Bookstore. *The dining hall was built in 1968. *September 10, 2014, Penn State Mont Alto opened its Veterans Center. The center was spearheaded by the Penn State Mont Alto Student Veterans Association (SVA) which received a $10,000 VetCenter Initiative grant from the SVA and The Home Depot Foundation partnership to refurbish the spring house on campus (built in 1905). It had previously served as a faculty lounge and mailroom. Now it has computers for Internet access and space for student veterans to study and gather. Arboretum The Mont Alto Arboretum is an arboretum located on the campus (). It was established on Arbor Day in 1905, just two years after the founding of the Pennsylvania State Forest Academy in Mont Alto. According to the college, on that day students searched for native tree species not present on campus, and brought back more than 400 specimens (30 species). These original plantings were then augmented by seeds from other trees native to the United States. This arboretum continues to provide a training ground for students, as well as a research site for the development of new hybrids. Athletics Penn State‚ÄìMont Alto teams participate as a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA). The Nittany Lions are a member of the Pennsylvania State University Athletic Conference (PSUAC). Men's varsity sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and wrestling; while women's varsity sports include basketball, cross country, softball, tennis and volleyball. Mont Alto also offers cheerleading and woodsmen team as club sports and has an active intramural program.

She is the author of the New York Times bestseller Harry, A History, which chronicles the Harry Potter phenomenon with exclusive interview material and a foreword written by Harry Potter creator J. K. Rowling. Anelli is also the full-time webmistress of The Leaky Cauldron, a commercial fansite devoted to the Harry Potter franchise for fans. Anelli also is one of three hosts of the Leaky Cauldron's official podcast PotterCast, which talks about various aspects of the Harry Potter books, movies, video games and more. The podcast conducted a two-episode interview with Rowling in late December 2007, after the publication of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Early life Anelli was born in Brooklyn and raised on Staten Island, New York. She is a graduate of Georgetown University, where she served as an editor for The Hoya. She became fascinated with the Harry Potter books in 2000, and active in Harry Potter fandom the following summer, shortly before the September 11 attacks in the United States. She says she was drawn into the series by its underlying message of tolerance and love, which she believes was especially needed as the United States geared for war. The Leaky Cauldron In 2001, Anelli joined the all-volunteer staff of The Leaky Cauldron, a relatively new web site devoted to the Harry Potter universe. On her own initiative, Anelli began contacting individuals at Warner Bros., which was producing the Harry Potter films, and at Scholastic, which published the Harry Potter books in the United States. It took a year before the movie studio took her seriously and began answering her questions with reportable information, and a longer period of time before the publishers agreed to do the same. By the end of 2002, The Leaky Cauldron was receiving over 500,000 hits per day. By November 2008, largely under Anelli's influence, the site became the second most popular English-language Harry Potter fansite, with over 1 million hits per day. In 2002, Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling announced that she would release a single index card containing 93 words that were clues to the content of the unreleased fifth novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The index card would be auctioned, with all proceeds benefitting Book Aid International. Anelli organized a campaign to have fans combine their money to purchase the card. She incorporated a nonprofit organization, Leaky, Inc., and became its first president. The card sold to an anonymous collector for $45,231, over six times the reserve price. Leaky, Inc. donated the $23,656 they had collected to Book Aid International. In 2005, Anelli established a for-profit entity, Leaky Net, LLC, to serve as the legal entity representing her TLC website business.NYS Department of State: Division of Corporations - Entity Information It is a private limited liability company registered in the state of New York, where she currently resides (as of 2009). Rowling praised Anelli and The Leaky Cauldron on her personal website in May 2007. Anelli had instituted a strict policy against spoilers of the seventh book, saying, \\"We just don't want someone taking what J. K. Rowling has earned away from her, which is the right to tell us where these mysteries end.\\" Rowling agreed, saying, \\"I want the readers who have, in many instances, grown up with Harry, to embark on the last adventure they will share with him without knowing where they are going.\\" Exclusive interview In 2005, Rowling personally invited Anelli and Emerson Spartz, the teenage webmaster of popular fansite Mugglenet, to Edinburgh, Scotland for the release of the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The two were granted an exclusive interview with Rowling the day after the book was released. The only other interview Rowling granted that weekend was to a group of 70 children, aged 8-16, who were selected in various contests for the honor. Anelli and Spartz were the only Americans included. The pair published an extensive, three-part interview on their respective websites. The interview caused some controversy within the Harry Potter fandom. At one point, Spartz referred to fans who believed that characters Harry Potter and Hermione Granger would become a couple as \\"delusional\\", and Anelli and Rowling laughed. Both Spartz and Anelli received a large quantity of hate mail from fans who believed they had been insulted. One adult fan remarked that, \\"It was like Melissa and Emerson were our representatives, and you don't want to hear your ambassadors be so partisan. You hope that they're speaking for everyone.\\" Anelli later commented that the irate fans had \\"lost the ability to divorce themselves between what J.K. Rowling is doing and what they'd like to see happen, and they've taken their disappointment and projected it onto her. I can totally understand how you could be upset if your preference didn't happen, but I can't understand or tolerate that people who claim to be her fans can be so mean to her.\\" PotterCast Anelli also serves as a host of PotterCast, a Harry Potter- centered podcast sponsored by The Leaky Cauldron. Episodes of the podcast average 30,000 downloads. The show attracts a slightly older audience than other Harry Potter podcasts, partly because its hosts are older, primarily in their twenties and thirties. PotterCast focuses primarily on news tidbits, with some celebrity interviews. http://www.the-leaky- cauldron.org/pottercast/?p=1856 Warner Brothers invited, and paid all costs, for Anelli and Andrew Sims, host of MuggleNet's podcast MuggleCast, to visit the set for filming of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The show has interviewed many people integral to creating the Harry Potter books and films, including actors, directors, book editors, and author J.K. Rowling herself. Anelli's work with PotterCast has led her to being on podcasts like Potterless and Fantastic Geeks (where to find them).  Victim of cyber-stalking  In 2008, Anelli began receiving threatening messages from Jessica Elizabeth Parker, a resident of New Zealand, whom she had banned from commenting at The Leaky Cauldron for offensive behavior. Parker continued to regularly harass Anelli for a period of 8 years, starting by sending her digital messages containing sexual and violent threats, but in later years also sending postcards and making phone calls to Anelli and her family. Anelli initially found it difficult to take legal action against Parker because she was a resident of a different country, and because cyberstalking laws were in a nascent stage, but in 2011, with the help of the FBI and Interpol, Parker was arrested in New Zealand for criminal harassment. Parker has been arrested twice more since 2011, but according to Anelli, the harassment never completely stopped. Career Anelli's work at The Leaky Cauldron was voluntary. During the day, she worked to support herself. In 2001, Anelli began working at MTV Networks' Pages Online, a magazine for the entertainment industry. By 2004, she had become a full-time reporter for the Staten Island Advance. Anelli is now a freelance journalist based in New York City. Her first book, Harry, A History, was released in early November 2008 and debuted at #18 on the New York Times Best Seller List. It tells the story of the Harry Potter phenomenon through a superfan's eyes. Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling wrote the foreword. Tim Cornwell in The Scotsman explains that \\"the book captures the flavour of Pottermania, where fans' e-mails fly...with the latest breathless news of the writer and her progeny.\\" Another review in the same paper, by Ernie Waters, says, \\"Anelli unravels what lies beneath the Harry Potter phenomenon and how it feels to be so wrapped up in the mystical world. ...Crammed with details and facts, from Harry Potter's struggles with Voldemort through to Rowling's personal life as she developed her adored characters, this is a heartfelt, well-written book by a true insider. ...It tries, and largely succeeds, to explain just what it is about the boy wizard which inspires such deep-seated devotion.\\" FootnotesExternal links *Melissa Anelli's personal web site *Melissa Anelli's Twitter - @melissaanelli *Official website of Harry, a History *The Leaky Cauldron **Anelli's exclusive interview with J.K.

Henry had become king after defeating Richard III in the Battle of Bosworth on 22 August 1485. However he backdated the start of his reign to 21 August, the day before the battle, enabling him to prosecute anyone who had fought under his rival, and to execute them for treason. This was highly controversial at the time, since it meant that, in a future battle, anyone who fought for the rightful king against a usurper would be at risk of execution if they lost, and this might undermine their courage in battle and their loyalty to their king. Nevertheless, Henry VII had his way at the time as Parliament was then in no position to oppose him (although later that year a general pardon was issued to those who had fought for Richard1 Hen.7 c. 6; The Statues at Large, vol. IV, Danby Pickering, Cambridge University, 1763, page 24). However, ten years later Henry's position on the throne was sufficiently secure that he could afford to grant Parliament what they wanted, when in 1495 they passed a bill to prevent the treason laws from being abused in this way again. The resulting Act is still in force today, and was applied to Scotland in 1708.Treason Act 1708 The Act was cited by Sir Harry Vane in his treason trial in 1662 following the Restoration. He was one of those accused of serving with Oliver Cromwell against the king during the English Civil War, and in his defence he relied upon the Act. However the court ruled that the 1495 Act was only intended to protect those who fought for a king, not to protect republican rebels who fought to abolish the monarchy. He was convicted and executed.

He originally appeared in the 1975 novel Salem's Lot and later The Dark Tower, appearing in The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla, The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah and finally The Dark Tower. He is at first an alcoholic with a troubled faith, but he seems to find his peace in The Dark Tower novels, and his faith is restored. History=Salem's Lot Father Callahan is the local Roman Catholic priest of the small Maine town of Jerusalem's Lot. An alcoholic, Callahan presides over the funeral of Danny Glick, a young boy who was, unbeknownst to the townsfolk, killed by the vampire Kurt Barlow. Life appears to go on as normal, but more and more of the populace are turned into vampires by Barlow and the new vampires he creates. Local writer Ben Mears, schoolteacher Matt Burke and a young boy named Mark Petrie discover what is happening. Joined by doctor Jimmy Cody and Susan Norton, they convince Callahan of the vampire presence and enlist him to help. Callahan leads a daytime assault on the old house that is Barlow's hiding place, only to find that the vampire has vacated the premises in anticipation of their attack. However, the group uses the opportunity to destroy the vampiric Susan, whom Barlow had turned during an unsuccessful attempt by her and Mark Petrie's to invade the house and destroy Barlow, and purify the house against future vampire occupation. That night, Callahan encounters Barlow himself when the latter invades the Petrie family's home and kills Mark's parents in retaliation for Mark killing Barlow's trusted human familiar. Barlow then seizes Mark and challenges Callahan to drop the cross he is using to hold him at bay and face him ‚Äúfaith to faith‚Äù. Callahan initially refuses, not trusting Barlow to release Mark, but Barlow ups the ante by releasing the boy, who flees. Now confronted with the choice, Callahan's faith fails, with the cross consequently becoming useless against Barlow. Barlow then seizes him, cuts open a vein in his own throat and forces the priest to drink his blood, damning him. Defeated, Callahan returns to his church, but burns his hand on the door and is refused entrance. Callahan leaves the town on a bus, bemoaning how \\"unclean\\" he has become. Wolves of the Calla After fleeing 'Salem's Lot, Callahan arrives in New York City, and becomes a vagrant. Now able to sense vampires, he realizes that they live and hunt all around him. His alcoholism gets worse but after he starts working at a homeless shelter, he begins to recover. He befriends several people, such as Rowan Magruder and Lupe Delgado. Callahan develops a deep fondness for Lupe, and later admits to having fallen in love with him. He wonders if this means he is gay, but despite a brief kiss on the cheek, nothing physical occurs between them. Callahan learns that there are three types of vampires. The Type Ones are the most powerful and are almost immortal. They can spread vampirism to others and create Type Two vampires. Kurt Barlow was a Type One. Type Twos are more common and can create other Type Twos or Type Threes. Lastly, the Type Threes cannot spread vampirism but can spread diseases that travel by blood, such as HIV. Callahan refers to them as \\"mosquitoes\\". After Lupe is infected by a Type Three vampire and dies from AIDS, Callahan begins to kill vampires (mostly Type Threes). This attracts the attention of the Crimson King and his soldiers, the Low Men or \\"can-toi\\". The Hitler Brothers, two hoodlums who murder Jews, black people and homosexuals and carve swastikas on their victim's foreheads, are hired to find Callahan. They torture Rowan Magruder, who later dies of his wounds, in hopes of finding him. They later find and attack Callahan, and carve a cross on his forehead, intending it to become a swastika. But before they can finish the swastika, Callahan is rescued by Calvin Tower and Aaron Deepneau, two men who figure prominently later in Roland's quest. The Hitler Brothers flee, and are later killed by the Low Men. Callahan is later lured into a building by Richard Sayre, a Low Man, and several vampires. Rather than be infected, he jumps out a window committing suicide. After his death, he wakes up in the Way Station, where he encounters Walter o'Dim who gives him Black Thirteen, one of the \\"Bends\\" in the Wizard's Rainbow. Walter apparently does so in the hopes that it will kill Roland Deschain later in his journey. It transports him to the Doorway Cave outside Calla Bryn Sturgis, where he leads a new life and over the next five years attempts to teach the locals his religion. Roughly every 23 years, the Callas are raided by wolves, which turn out to be robotic soldiers serving the Crimson King. These Wolves steal half of the Calla's children, who return a few months later \\"roont\\". \\"Roont\\" (ruined) children are sterile, mentally handicapped, grow to be larger and stronger than other children, and die painfully at a younger age. When Roland and his ka-tet arrive, Callahan seeks their help to defeat the Wolves. During their stay, he shares with them his story since the events of 'Salem's Lot. The Wolves are defeated with the help of the ka-tet, but Susannah becomes possessed by the demon succubus known as Mia and escapes via the Doorway Cave. There, Callahan discovers a copy of the novel 'Salem's Lot, in which he is a major character, causing him to question his reality. Song of Susannah Immediately after the events of the previous book, the ka-tet regroups in Callahan's house, where they lay down their plans of action; Roland and Eddie would follow Susannah to New York while Jake and Callahan would be sent to Maine, in order to visit Calvin Tower (the man who saved Callahan from the Hitler Brothers) as well as Stephen King, in order to ensure that the remaining books are written. While there, Callahan planned on questioning King about his existence, but something goes wrong when the door is opened. The group is uncontrollably sucked through and separated, with Roland and Eddie ending up in Maine and Jake, Callahan, and Oy landing in New York City in the year 1999. The trio lands violently in the middle of a busy street, and Oy is very nearly run down by a speeding cab. Preventing a potentially deadly response from an angry Jake, Callahan beats down the aggressive driver and bribes him (before Jake had the opportunity to shoot him), and they remove themselves from the scene. Thanks to Jake's psychic connection with Susannah, they find the hotel where Susannah/Mia left Black Thirteen. They attempt to remove it safely, but it awakens and forces them both to their knees, urging them to murder each other. They nearly succumb to the suicidal whisperings, but Callahan uses his restored faith to silence the orb, putting it back into its slumber and saving their lives. In search of a safe storage place, he and Jake move Black Thirteen to a long-term storage locker underneath the World Trade Center, with the hope that either it will stay dormant or Roland will at some point come to destroy it (rather aptly, they comment on how a building falling on it might destroy it, foreshadowing that the future terrorist attack will be the end of the crystal ball). They go to the Dixie Pig, the restaurant stronghold of the Low Men and vampires where Susannah is being held, where they prepare to ambush the unknown forces within. The Dark Tower Father Callahan from The Dark Tower. Art by Michael Whelan. Jake and Callahan burst into the Dixie Pig, where they are greeted by a preponderance of Low Men and lesser vampires, as well as a gathering of \\"Type One\\" vampires (of which there are only a small number in existence). Seeing the overwhelming odds against them, Callahan sends Jake on ahead to rescue Susannah while he draws their attention. After dispatching several Low Men and Type Ones, he is goaded to toss away both his cross and the sigul of the turtle (the magical ornament that incapacitates the Low Men). At this point, Callahan realizes what he did not understand while facing Barlow in 'Salem's Lot: the power of his faith transcends such objects. Eventually, once Jake has reached relative safety, Callahan is overwhelmed and swarmed by the vampires. Before the beasts can assault him, he once again escapes their clutches by shooting himself under the chin. Before taking his own life, he converses briefly with Roland, who bears witness to the scene across time and space. His final words to Roland and in life were a benediction to the Gunslinger: \\"May you find your Tower, Roland, and breach it,...and may you climb to the top!\\" Jake in particular was disturbed by his death, and the ka-tet mourned the loss of their friend and compatriot. When Roland finally made it to the Dark Tower, Callahan's is one of the names shouted by Roland as he walks through the field of roses, showing Roland's respect and love for the redeemed priest. Other versions=Deleted scene The original draft of Salem's Lot originally depicted a different fate for Callahan. Rather than forced to drink Barlow's blood and leaving town damned, he marks the vampire with a knife before committing suicide. Furious, the vampire desecrates the priest's body, decapitating it and hanging it upside down. This scene was changed by King before he originally published the story, though it was included in a section of deleted scenes featured in the deluxe limited edition released by Centipede Press in 2005 and the later trade edition. 1979 miniseries In the 1979 miniseries adaptation of Salem's Lot, Father Callahan is featured only as a minor character. He is played by James Gallery. Callahan is first briefly seen officiating at the funeral of Danny Glick. Later, Ben Mears and Susan Norton have a brief interview with him where they try to convince him to join them against the evil in the town. Callahan is skeptical and makes a brief comment on how the Church's view of evil has changed. Soon afterwards, Callahan is at the Petrie house to talk to Mark and his parents about Mark's nocturnal experiences. Abruptly, with a surge of electricity and a tremor, the vampire Barlow enters, kills the Petrie parents, seizes Mark and challenges Callahan. The exchange, although shortened, is much the same as in the original novel, only with Straker, now also present, interpreting for the monstrous and inarticulate Barlow. Barlow lets Mark go in order to confront Callahan, who falteringly hold on to his crucifix while facing the vampire. Barlow plucks the Crucifix from the priest's hand, and Callahan is not seen again, presumably killed. 1995 radio drama In the BBC radio-dramatization of the Salem's Lot novel, Callahan was voiced and played by Nigel Anthony. 2004 miniseries James Cromwell as Father Callahan. In the 2004 Salem's Lot miniseries, Father Callahan was portrayed by James Cromwell. The beginning of the film shows an event taking place after most of the story; Ben Mears enters a homeless shelter in a big city and sees Callahan giving out food. Mears confronts Callahan and chases him up some stairs where they struggle. Callahan shoots Mears, but Mears pushes himself and Callahan out a window and the two of them land on a police car. The rest of the film is told in flashback as Ben explains to a hospital orderly why he attacked Callahan. Callahan is generally portrayed as in the novel (although there is a scene with him browsing what could be a Satanic porn site), but after Barlow forces him to drink his blood, Callahan does not leave town in shame. Instead, he takes Straker's place as Barlow's attendant. Callahan later visits Matt Burke in the hospital and murders him. After Ben Mears destroys Barlow, Callahan then leads the remaining vampires of Salem's Lot as his new unholy congregation while the town burns around them. As Ben Mears tells his story to the orderly, Callahan is suffocated with a pillow by Mark Petrie in the hospital. The framing story of Callahan now living in a big city, working in a homeless shelter and his being pushed out of an upper storey window are clearly inspired by the events in the Dark Tower: Wolves of the Calla novel, though the miniseries does not use any of the further material featuring Callahan from the other Dark Tower books, which feature his return and redemption.

Life and work Dr Bell's School, Leith Andrew Bell was born at St. Andrews, in Scotland on 27 March 1753 and attended St. Andrews University where he did well in mathematics and natural philosophy, graduating in 1774.Blackie 901 In 1774 he sailed to Virginia as a private tutor and remained there until 1781 when he left to avoid involvement in the war of independence. He returned to Scotland, surviving a shipwreck on the way, and officiated at the Episcopal Chapel in Leith. He was ordained Deacon in 1784 and Priest in the Church of England in 1785. In February 1787 he went out to India and went ashore at Madras, where he stayed for 10 years. He became chaplain to a number of British regiments and gave a course of lectures. In 1789 he was appointed superintendent of an orphan asylum for the illegitimate and orphaned sons of officers. He claimed to see some Malabar children teaching others the alphabet by drawing in sand and decided to develop a similar method, putting bright children in charge of those who were less bright. He was opposed to corporal punishment and used a system of rewards.Blackie 903 In Bell's adaption of the Madras, or monitorial system as it later came to be known, a schoolmaster would teach a small group of brighter or older pupils basic lessons, and each of them would then relate the lesson to another group of children.For Bell's early account of his system see: He was a careful man and accumulated considerable wealth. In August 1796 he left India because of his health and published an account of his system, which started to be introduced into a few English schools from 1798/99, and he devoted himself to spreading and developing the system. He served as a priest in Edinburgh for a short time and married Agnes, daughter of a Dr George Barclay in December 1801. He was then appointed Rector of Swanage in Dorset and established a school there to teach straw-plaiting to girls and also using his system to teach infants. He and his wife adopted the new discovery of vaccination for smallpox and personally successfully vaccinated very many people in the district. However his marriage was unsuccessful and a decree of judicial separation was granted in 1806.Blackie 904 Another educationist, Joseph Lancaster, was promoting a similar but not identical system and their differences developed into a major and continuing dispute. Unlike Bell's schools, those established by Lancaster were not committed to the Church of England.Blackie 903-4 Bell received powerful support from the Church and his system was adopted in army schools and the Clergy Orphan School. A society was founded in November 1811 which set up schools using Bell's system. This was the National Society for the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Christian Church. By the time of his death twelve thousand schools had been established in Great Britain and the colonies. The system was also used by the Church Missionary Society and other institutions.Blackie 904-5 Bell was a fanatical enthusiast for his system and an intolerant man. He was difficult to deal with and hard to work under. Nevertheless, he always got on well with children.Blackie 905 & throughout Death He retired to Lindsay Cottage in Cheltenham, a wealthy man, at the age of 75 and died at home, aged 78, on 27 January 1832. He was buried in Westminster Abbey with a monument designed and carved by William Behnes.Dictionary of British Sculptors, 1660-1851, Rupert Gunnis He left substantial sums of money for educational purposes but with what many considered unreasonable conditions attached.Blackie 905 His system did not survive for long after his death. It needed close and enthusiastic supervision and small classes and was only really useful when funds were sparse and teachers in very short supply.cf.

According to the medieval The Georgian Chronicles, the Shirvanese princes were granted the possessions in the province of Abkhazia after David IV, one of Georgia's greatest kings, extended his kingdom to Shirvan in 1124 . Modern Abkhaz historians dispute the above genealogy and claim the family was of local origin referring to an oral Abkhaz tradition which holds that the Sharvashidze/Shervashidze were related to the earlier clan of Anchabadze/Achba (see Abkhazian Kingdom ¬ß Rulers). The first representative of the dynasty assumed the princely powers under the authority of the Georgian kings circa 1325. It was not, however, until the final decomposition of the unified Georgian feudal state in the late 15th century, when the Abkhazian princes obtained their full independence, only to soon become vassals of the Ottoman Empire. That Turkish overlordship brought major changes in their palace culture and political leanings, with the Sharvashidze gradually losing their ties with the Christian Georgian nobility. In the late 18th century, the Sharvashidze princes embraced Islam, but shifted back and forth across the religious divide, as the Russians and Ottomans struggled for controlling the area. The pro-Russian orientation prevailed, and Abkhazia joined Imperial Russia in 1810 while the Sharvashidzes () were confirmed in the Russian princely rank in accordance with the Russo-Georgian Treaty of Georgievsk. Today, the most senior branch of the family lives in Bulgaria and United States, where they emigrated after the First World War.

Biography Sonetti was born in Piombino, southern Tuscany and lives now in Gorle.From Gazzetta dello Sport wabsite Playing career As a defender, Sonetti played in Serie B and Serie C for Spezia Calcio 1906 and Reggina. Managing career As a manager, Sonetti has had a long career at the helm of several Serie A and Serie B teams in the whole country. Among the several teams he led, he had his major successes with Atalanta B.C., which he led from Serie B to a ninth place in Serie A, coaching the team for four seasons. He is often considered a \\"replacement\\" coach, as he was often appointed in his career to replace fired managers from Serie A teams fighting to avoid relegation, or Serie B teams which managed to promote. More recently, Sonetti joined Cagliari on November 2005, replacing Davide Ballardini, becoming the fourth coach appointed by the Sardinian team in a couple of months. He succeeded in maintaining his job until the end of the tournament, and in leading the rossobl√π to maintain a place in the next Serie A; he left Cagliari at the end of the season. On 14 November 2006, Sonetti was appointed to replace Attilio Tesser at the helm of then last-placed relegation-battling Serie A Ascoli. He did not manage to save his side from falling to Serie B, and ended his experience in Ascoli at the end of the season with a second-last place. On November 2007 he returned at Cagliari for his third time, as he was appointed to replace Marco Giampaolo at the helm of the Sardinians. He resigned from his post on 19 December, but was confirmed by the club the next day after Marco Giampaolo rejected to return at the helm of the club. However, Sonetti was sacked only a few days later, after a 5‚Äì1 loss to Fiorentina, leaving the team last-placed in the league table, being replaced by Davide Ballardini. From 25 September 2008, he has been called back to Brescia replacing Serse Cosmi. On 19 May 2009 he was sacked himself, following a 2‚Äì1 loss to promotion rivals Grosseto that left Brescia in fourth placed, but with only a two-point lead to 7th-placed Triestina.

Approximately one million cell nuclei are isolated and incubated with labeled nucleotides, and genes in the process of being transcribed are detected by hybridization of extracted RNA to gene specific probes on a blot. Garcia-Martinez et al. (2004) developed a protocol for the yeast S. cerevisiae (Genomic run-on, GRO) that allows for the calculation of transcription rates (TRs) for all yeast genes to estimate mRNA stabilities for all yeast mRNAs. Alternative microarray methods have recently been developed, mainly PolII RIP-chip: RNA immunoprecipitation of RNA polymerase II with phosphorylated C-terminal domain directed antibodies and hybridization on a microarray slide or chip (the word chip in the name stems from \\"ChIP-chip\\" where a special Affymetrix GeneChip was required). A comparison of methods based on run-on and ChIP-chip has been made in yeast (Pelechano et al., 2009). A general correspondence of both methods has been detected but GRO is more sensitive and quantitative. It has to be considered that run-on only detects elongating RNA polymerases whereas ChIP-chip detects all present RNA polymerases, including backtracked ones. Overview of the Global run on sequencing assay for delineating genes, genome-wide, that are engaged in transcription.Attachment of new RNA polymerase to genes is prevented by inclusion of sarkosyl. Therefore only genes that already have an RNA polymerase will produce labeled transcripts. RNA transcripts that were synthesized before the addition of the label will not be detected as they will lack the label. These run on transcripts can also be detected by purifying labeled transcripts by using antibodies that detect the label and hybridizing these isolated transcripts with gene expression arrays or by next generation sequencing (GRO-Seq). Run on assays have been largely supplanted with Global Run on assays that use next generation DNA sequencing as a readout platform. These assays are known as GRO-Seq and provide an incredibly detailed view of genes engaged in transcription with quantitative levels of expression. Array based methods for analyzing Global run on (GRO) assays are being replaced with Next Generation Sequencing which eliminates the design of probes against gene sequences. Sequencing will catalog all transcripts produced even if they are not reported in databases. GRO-seq involves the labeling of newly synthesized transcripts with bromouridine (BrU). Cells or nuclei are incubated with BrUTP in the presence of sarkosyl, which prevents the attachment of RNA polymerase to the DNA. Therefore only RNA polymerase that are already on the DNA before the addition of sarkosyl will produce new transcripts that will be labeled with BrU. The labeled transcripts are captured with anti-BrU antibody labeled beads, converted to cDNAs and then sequenced by Next Generation DNA sequencing. The sequencing reads are then aligned to the genome and number of reads per transcript provide an accurate estimate of the number of transcripts synthesized.

History Catalina Island was developed as a tourist site beginning in the 1920s by William Wrigley Jr., who owned most of the island under the Santa Catalina Island Company. In 1941 his son Philip K. Wrigley built a runway on the island by blasting and leveling two hills and filling the canyon between them to create a leveled area. The airport opened as Buffalo Springs Airport in the spring of 1941, as a private airport.California State Military Museum: History of the Buffalo Springs Airport, Catalina Island Prior to this, only seaplanes landed at Hamilton Cove Seaplane Base, just north of Avalon. World War II In the autumn of 1942 the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) took control of the Buffalo Springs Airport for the duration of World War II, to support Army, Navy, Coast Guard, the Maritime Service, and the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) activities on the island. It was also a USAAF Fourth Air Force Replacement Training Station. The airfield operated during that time as a sub- base of March Field located in Riverside County. At the conclusion of the war, the military presence departed. A California aviation veteran, Richard Probert (1907‚Äì2008), worked to have Buffalo Springs Airport opened to the public. To that end he caused a terminal building to be raised, and in 1946 the field began operating as a public use airport, called Catalina Airport.\\"Catalina Goose\\" ‚Äì Avalon Air Transport honors co-founder Dick Probert (accessed 10 May 2019)Biography: Richard \\"Dick\\" Probert (20 August 2014, accessed 10 May 2019) Former commercial flights Douglas DC-3 at Catalina Airport In the early 1950s, United Airlines served the airport with scheduled passenger service with nonstop flights to Long Beach Airport and direct, one-stop service to Los Angeles International Airport operated with Douglas DC-3 aircraft.January 1953 United Air Lines system timetable During the mid-1950s, Catalina Air Lines was operating de Havilland Dove twin propeller aircraft on nonstop flights to Los Angeles International and Burbank Airport (now Bob Hope Airport).June 1955(?)

Repairs After some seventy years of use, the asphalt runway was in poor condition, requiring hundreds of thousands of dollars annually in maintenance. The Aeronautics Division of Caltrans directed the Catalina Island Conservancy to create a long-term repair plan. The Conservancy worked with the Marines at Camp Pendleton, whose forces performed the repairs as a training exercise in January 2019. An encampment was erected at the airport to support the 120-person crew, and by 3 May the runway was reopened for operation. The work cost about five million dollars, paid by the airport owners. The first airplane to land on the 3,000' (914m) runway was a 1944 Douglas DC-3 that had originally been owned and operated by the Wrigley family.\\"Airport In The Sky reopens\\".

Licensed to the village of Willimantic, Connecticut, it serves eastern Connecticut. Willimantic is a village within the town of Windham, Connecticut. It is the sister station to WILI/1400. The station is currently owned by Hall Communications, Inc. The studios are located on Main Street in Willimantic, near the Willimantic Footbridge. History The history of 98.3 FM in Willimantic began in 1971, with two competing proposals for the allocation of 98.3 in Connecticut: A proposal for the allocation to go to Willimantic submitted by Colin K. Rice and his family‚Äôs Nutmeg Broadcasting, and a competing proposal from a group headed by Randal Mayer of WWUH and WHCN- FM and Kenneth N. Dawson of WKND to allocate the frequency to Enfield. In early 1972, the FCC allocated the frequency to Willimantic, making 98.3 the only FM in Windham County. By December 1972, Nutmeg Broadcasting and the newly formed Windham Broadcast Group were competing for the 98.3 license in Willimantic. The Windham Broadcast Group was also backed by Mayer and Dawson, the petitioners to have the frequency allocated to Enfield. Also in 1972, Nutmeg Broadcasting received approval to build an FM tower on Gates Road at the site of two microwave towers owned by Southern New England Telephone, but allowed the permit to expire. The FCC decided in favor of The Windham Broadcast Group in February 1975. The station was assigned the call letters WXLS, and went on the air featuring a beautiful music format in June 1975 with studios at 1491 West Main Street, Willimantic (Across from Capitol Chrysler Dodge Jeep, currently a drug treatment facility) and with transmitting facilities on Hosmer Mountain, off Route 289 in Willimantic. The station broadcast with 3,000 watts from a single bay circularly polarized antenna, powered by a Rockwell-Collins 831F-2 Generation 4 transmitter that could put out 12,000 watts. Several engineers in the area reported ‚Äústronger than usual‚Äù power output from the site. Immediately residents complained of severe interference to television reception caused by WXLS. General Manager Peter Aucion met with the town‚Äôs Common Council four weeks after the station took to the air and agreed to provide $5,000.00 in rebates to residents to purchase antenna filters to block out 98.3. In 1975 WXLS applied to build a tower on Gates Hill in Lebanon, however were denied a permit by the Zoning Board of Appeals. In August 1978 it was announced that Nutmeg Broadcasting had filed to purchase WXLS from the XLS Broadcasting Corp. Also in 1978, Nutmeg applied to build a 300-foot tower off route 87 in Columbia to improve the signal to the west. Fierce resident opposition to the tower led to the Planning and Zoning commission denying the application for the tower in November 1978. WILI re- applied for an FM tower permit on Gates Hill in Lebanon, and were once again approved. By 1979 a $10,000 attachment had been filed against WXLS for unpaid bills for syndicated programming provided by Peter Productions of San Diego, CA. However, Nutmeg once again lost out on the $200,000 purchase of WXLS, and the station was sold to Delta Communications Co. of Washington, D.C. in 1979. Delta was a minority owned company, making the station the state‚Äôs first minority owned FM station. The station was sold for $175,000 under the FCC‚Äôs distressed sale policy, allowing stations facing license renewal hearings to avoid losing their license by selling to minority owned companies at prices below market value. WXLS and co-owned WKND were facing allegations of fraudulent billing practices and staff mismanagement. Both stations were sold to separate minority-owned companies. Studios were relocated to 75 Bridge Street at the foot of Hosmer Mountain, and call letters were changed to WNOU on June 10, 1980, the station dropped beautiful music and changed to UC under their new moniker ‚ÄúThe All New Nou 98 FM‚Äù, and billed themselves as both ‚ÄúThe Heart and Soul of Connecticut‚Äù and \\"There's nothing good as Nou!\\" The station featured mornings with Ray Pender and Mark Virdone a.k.a. \\"The Nou 98 FM's Dynamic Duo\\" from 5:30 am to 10:00 am. Program Director Gregg Dixon was on the air from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm, Sara from 3:00 pm to 7:00pm, and Eddie ‚ÄúThe Cowboy‚Äù Schaffer with ‚ÄúThe Nou 98 FM's Night Service‚Äù from 7:00 pm to 12:00 am. Additional programming featured minority-produced syndicated ‚ÄúCoast to Coast Top 20‚Äù with Doug Steele, and from 1983-1985 the daily syndicated feature Radioscope with Lee Bailey, also a minority-owned program. Sundays featured Music of the City at 9, Caribbean Vibes from 10-2 and All That Jazz evenings with TJ Magnum, the stage name for station owner Sullivan Brown. Brown also took to the airwaves Saturdays as TJ Magnum. On the morning of February 21, 1985, the morning team of Ray Pender and Mark Virdone took to the air to describe the financial disrepair and mismanagement of WNOU, staying on the air until 12 noon, calling for any investors to come forward to purchase the station. Dubbed the ‚Äú98gate,‚Äù the hosts invited in listeners and media crews, including WFSB-TV Channel 3. Telephones had already been disconnected by the telephone company for nonpayment. Owner Sullivan Brown came from his home in Bloomfield and removed the personalities from the station and took over broadcasting, as if nothing had happened. Around 3 PM, midday personality and Program Director Gregg Dixon forcefully kicked in the door to the control room and removed the power supply to the control board, taking the station off the air. Nou 98 FM never returned to the air. At the time, Brown admitted that the station was under foreclosure proceedings. On July 31, 1985 the FCC approved the sale of silent WNOU to Nutmeg Broadcasting Co. for $645,000, including the payment of federal back taxes owed by Delta. According to an article in the Hartford Courant, the majority of the purchase price was used to pay off the debts of the financially troubled station. The call letters were changed to WILI-FM on October 7, 1985 and the station returned to the air as a simulcast of WILI-AM. In January 1986, the simulcast was split, with WILI becoming an adult contemporary station featuring more talk programming, and WILI-FM became a CHR station billed as ‚ÄúThe New I-98 FM‚Äù Separate studios were built in a closet at 948 Main Street while new facilities were built at 720 Main Street. WILI and WILI-FM both moved to 720 Main Street in the fall of 1987. In 2005, The Nutmeg Broadcasting Company was purchased by Hall Communications from the Rice family for $1.8 million. Hall continues to operate Nutmeg Broadcasting as a subsidiary, and has maintained all local services and facilities at 720 Main Street in Willimantic. Ownership Former logo of the radio station used until April 2003 In May 2005, Connecticut-based Hall Communications reached an agreement to acquire WILI and WILI-FM from Nutmeg Broadcasting Co.

This document, which could be over 134 pages long, is used to secure financing for and lead to pre-production and production of the film. Multiple drafts of the budget may be required to whittle down costs. A budget is typically divided into four sections: above the line (creative talent), below the line (direct production costs), post-production (editing, visual effects, etc.), and other (insurance, completion bond, etc.) The budget excludes film promotion and marketing, which is the responsibility of the film distributor. Film financing can be acquired from a private investor, sponsor, product placement, film studio, entertainment company, and out-of-pocket funds. When it comes to reporting the budget of a film, the amount of the budget represents the gross budget, which is the grand total of actual spending to produce the project and not to be confused with net budget, which represents the final out of pocket for the producer after government incentives or rebates (\\"If you pay $50 for something but have a mail-in coupon for a $10 rebate, your gross spending still amounts to $50.\\"). One of the consequences of the Sony hack was the release of budget information of many films or TV shows, including the 2015 Adam Sandler film Pixels. The actual cost to produce Pixels, or the \\"grand total\\", was $129.6 million and the net budget for Sony came to $111 million after they received a government rebate in Canada that covered a portion of their gross spend (cost) in the amount of just over $18 million. Even though Sony's out of pocket for the film was reduced because of the incentive, it does not negate the fact that the actual cost (amount spent during production to make the film) was still $129.6 million. Elements * Story rights: The right to produce a film based on a play, novel, musical or video game, or as a remake or sequel can cost anything from a couple of thousand (e.g., Leaving Las Vegas) to over $10 million (e.g., the video game Halo). * Screenplay: An A-list screenwriter may be paid between $100,000 to $2 million to write a script, including $400,000 a week for each rewrite of a film in trouble; script doctors may be called upon to revise the final draft at $100,000 to $200,000 a week. Recently, Columbia Pictures has been offering the best screenwriters 2 percent of the gross profits (after the production and marketing budget has been deducted).

Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable). * Producers: Film producers and executive producers are often well-paid, with a top producer earning a seven-figure salary upfront as well as bonuses and a share of the profits. For Spider-Man (2002), producer Laura Ziskin is estimated to have been paid over $30 million. * Director: The DGA minimum is about $19,143 per week, for a minimum of ten weeks' work. An A-list film director can command $5 to $10 million per film. * Cast: While the bulk of the cast usually gets paid by the Actors Guild standard rate of about 2,300 US$ per week, famous and bankable film stars can demand fees up to $30 million per film, plus perks (trailer, entourage, etc.) and possible gross participation. Sometimes an actor will accept a minimal fee in exchange for a more lucrative share of the profits. Union extras are paid around $130 per day (plus extra for overtime or if they provide their own wardrobe), but on a low-budget film non-union extras are paid less, sometimes nothing at all. * Production costs: The cost of producing the film includes crew wages, production design, live set and studio costs, costumes, catering (food and drinks etc.), accommodation, transportation, travel, hotel stay, etc. The director of photography is usually the highest paid member of the crew. * Visual effects: The cost of computer-generated imagery effects and other visual effect work in post-production depends largely on the amount of work, the desired quality, and the effects company involved (Industrial Light and Magic is the most prestigious and expensive); extensive effect work, as in Avatar or The Lord of the Rings, can easily cost up to $100,000,000. * Music: Typically, the music budget of a major motion picture is about 2 percent of the final total. Some, such as Spider-Man's music budget, have been as high as $4.5 million. The top film composers can ask for a seven-figure salary to compose about an hour of original film score. For well-known artists, like Christina Aguilera (Shark Tale) or Kanye West (Mission: Impossible III), the cost may be around $1 million for an original song; for existing works it may be around $300,000. Sometimes a less-known artist will license the rights to their song for a small fee in exchange for the publicity. Tactics for cutting costs * Eliminate night scenes. Shooting at night requires powerful/expensive lighting and the payment of nighttime rates to the crew. Broken Arrow (1996) cut costs by millions of dollars by eliminating the night scenes from the script. Many directors choose to use the \\"day for night\\" technique. * Avoid location filming in famous or commercial areas. Shooting a scene on, say, the Golden Gate Bridge requires stopping traffic with a resultant drop in revenue to the city of San Francisco. Filming such a scene for Interview with the Vampire cost Warner Bros. $500,000. Shifting the location to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge for close-ups could potentially save hundreds of thousands of dollars in location fees. Moreover, some locations (such as commercial enterprises like hotels and nightclubs) are more willing to allow filming than others. Some producers of low-budget features avoid paying location fees and seek to capture shots by subterfuge. * Film action scenes early on Sunday morning. Stopping traffic for a car chase scene is easier in the early hours of Sunday morning, when traffic is at its lightest. * Use unknown, non-famous actors instead of well-established movie stars. * Ask above-the-line talent to defer their salaries. In exchange for dropping their large upfront salaries, actors, directors, and producers can receive a large share of the film's gross profits. This has the disadvantage of cutting the financier's eventual takings. It has the further disadvantage of ambiguity. In the case of net profit participation instead of gross profit participation, disagreements due to Hollywood accounting methods can lead to audits and litigation, as happened between Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema, after New Line claimed The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, which grossed over 2 billion USD, failed to make any profit and thus denied payments to actors, the Tolkien Estate, and Jackson. * Use a non-union crew. This is not an option for studios that have signed contracts with the unions--the Directors Guild of America (DGA), Writers Guild of America (WGA), and Screen Actors Guild (SAG). Director Robert Rodriguez has been known to use the skills of experienced non-union crews for his films. * Film in another region. For example, many Hollywood movies set in U.S. cities are shot in Canada to take advantage of lower labour costs, subject to fluctuating exchange rates. As well, they take advantage of federal and provincial subsidies designed to grow and sustain the film and television production industries in the area. Many U.S. states have responded with tax incentives of their own (see Movie production incentives in the United States). Australia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Germany, Malta, and New Zealand are other countries in which Hollywood movies are often filmed.  Going over budget  In the US film production system, producers are typically not allowed to exceed the initial budget. Exceptions have of course been made, one of the most notable examples being Titanic (1997). Director James Cameron ran over budget and offered his fee back to the studio. In other countries, producers who exceed their budget tend to eat the cost by receiving less of their producer's fees. While the US system is profitable and can afford to go over budget, some other countries' film industries tend to be financed through government subsidies. Examples Though movie studios are reluctant to release the precise details of their movies' budgets, it has occasionally been possible to obtain (clandestinely) details of the cost of films' breakdowns. For an example of a budget for a $2 million independent feature, see Planning the Low-Budget Film by Robert Latham Brown.

Penn State Shenango is the only urban campus in the Penn State system, although some parts of Penn State Altoona that are located in the heart of Altoona's downtown are urban in nature. History In 1963 a group of local citizens formed the Shenango Valley Citizens College Procurement Committee with the purpose of expanding the higher education opportunities in the area. After a series of meetings with the Penn State Board of Trustees, a plan was developed in 1964 for creating a new Penn State campus in Sharon that would allow students to start their college career locally and transfer to the flagship campus in University Park. The State Board of Education approved this proposal, and the first students were admitted to the Penn State Shenango Valley campus in 1965. Lecture Hall is the oldest structure on the Penn State Shenango campus. Initially, classes were held in Kennedy Catholic High School as funds were raised for the construction of a permanent campus. After briefly considering building a campus from scratch in Hickory Township (now Hermitage), the directors instead chose to base the campus around existing buildings in downtown Sharon. The first buildings to be purchased for the campus were Sharon Hall and Lecture Hall, which were purchased from the Sharon Central School District. As programs and enrollment grew, new buildings were constructed or purchased adjoining Sharon and Lecture Halls during the 1970s and 1980s. In the late 1980s the \\"Valley\\" was dropped from the official name of the campus. At the start of the 2006-2007 academic year, a $9.4 million renovation of campus was completed. The renovation updated Sharon and Lecture Halls linking them with an enclosed glass atrium. The renovations also transformed the former gymnasium space in Sharon Hall into the Great Hall including new food service, fitness, and student activities spaces. Currently the campus is entering a capital campaign to raise funds for modernizing the Auditorium Building with an eye to adding increased accessibility, new restroom facilities, and updating the space for multiple uses. Construction on the first phase of this project was completed in 2009. Chadderton Laboratory was completely renovated in 2013 to house the newly formed Occupational Therapy Assistant program and contains office, laboratory, and classroom space for this program Athletics Penn State Shenango supports varsity squads in men's basketball, women's volleyball and women's basketball (to begin in 2021). The school competes in the Penn State University Athletic Conference. Penn State‚ÄìShenango intramural sports include: men's golf, flag football, basketball, volleyball, and tennis. Facilities The Shenango campus consists of ten educational and support buildings, including: * Sharon Hall (built 1928) The primary classroom and office building on campus houses administration, faculty offices, computer labs, classroom space, and the Great Hall student center. * Lecture Hall (built 1904) Includes campus admissions and financial aid offices, classroom space, and faculty offices. A glass atrium connecting Sharon and Lecture halls was constructed in 2006. * Science Building (built 1968) Includes faculty offices and science classrooms. * Forker Laboratory (built 1972) Science labs, classroom space, and the Forum, a large classroom used for lectures and events is located here. It is connected to the Science Building. * Chadderton Laboratory The former headquarters of the local television cable company, this building was renovated in 2013 and houses the Occupational Therapy Assistant program, including office, classroom, and laboratory spaces. * McDowell Hall Houses the campus bookstore, Human Development and Family Studies, Administration of Justice, and Administration of Justice Crime Lab. * Lartz Memorial Library Originally housing a commercial laundry, and then a local steelworkers union hall, the Library was renovated in 1996 and houses the campus library collections, study areas, a classroom, and the Media Commons. * Physical Therapy Laboratory Another former office building now houses the Physical Therapy Assistant program. * Penn State Theatre (Auditorium) (built 1928) The former Auditorium of the Sharon Central School District, now used for large gatherings including commencement, concerts, and the Penn State Lecture Series.

Early career Washington graduated from Lincoln High School in Port Arthur, Texas where his father coached football. Washington had a stellar college football career at the University of Oklahoma where he was a two time First-team All-American and finished third in the Heisman Trophy balloting in 1974 and fifth in 1975. He finished his career at Oklahoma with 4,071 career rushing yards. He is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. Professional career=San Diego Chargers Washington was drafted fourth overall in the first round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers. A knee injury forced him to miss the entire 1976 season for the Chargers. In 1977 he played sparingly, appearing in 13 games while rushing for 217 yards and having 244 yards receiving. A month prior to the start of the 1978 season, he was traded to the Baltimore Colts for 3 time Pro Bowl running back Lydell Mitchell. Baltimore Colts In 1978, his first year with the Colts, he had 958 yards rushing, which was a career high. In 1979 he led the NFL with 82 receptions. He also had 750 yards receiving and 884 yards rushing along with seven touchdowns. This led Washington to being voted to the 1979 Pro Bowl. His most memorable performance was on September 18, 1978 in Baltimore's 34‚Äì27 victory over the New England Patriots on Monday Night Football, when he had a hand in three of the four touchdowns scored by the Colts in a fourth quarter in which both teams combined for 41 points. He helped lead off the scoring by throwing a 54-yard option pass to Roger Carr. Washington followed that up with a 23-yard touchdown catch from Bill Troup. Washington broke a 27‚Äì27 deadlock by scoring the game-winner on a 90-yard kickoff return in a driving rainstorm. It was scored in the final seconds of the game after the Patriots came back from 27 to 13.[1][2] He remains the only NFL player to ever throw a touchdown, catch a touchdown and return a kickoff for a touchdown in a single game. Washington Redskins On April 28, 1981, the Washington Redskins obtained Washington by trading a second-round pick in the 1981 NFL Draft to the Baltimore Colts. During his first year with the Redskins in 1981, Washington combined with future Hall of Famer John Riggins to give the Redskins a formidable running game. Washington led the team in rushing with 916 yards and receptions with 70 to go along with 558 yards receiving. The strike shortened 1982 season was mostly a disappointing season for Washington as he only recorded 190 yards rushing during the 9 game regular season and only touched the ball seven times during the Redskins run through the playoffs where they defeated the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl XVII. Washington returned to his normal dual threat capabilities in 1983 as he recorded 772 yards rushing and 454 yards receiving as the Redskins returned to the Super Bowl only to lose Super Bowl XVIII to the Los Angeles Raiders. During the 1984 season, Washington only played in 7 games for the Redskins and recorded 192 yards rushing. Atlanta Falcons He was traded to the Atlanta Falcons during the 1985 NFL Draft and finished his career with one season in Atlanta. During the 1985 season with the Falcons, Washington appeared in all 16 games while recording 210 yards rushing and 37 receptions for 328 yards. Washington retired with 4,839 rushing yards and 3,413 receiving yards and 30 touchdowns in his career.

History In May 1915, two Penn State graduates, reacting to the needs of the local anthracite mining industry, proposed the development of a Penn State engineering center in Wilkes-Barre. \\"King Coal\\" reigned supreme at that time in the Wyoming Valley and engineers were needed to improve mining methods and worker safety. The response from local citizens and civic organizations was overwhelming, and on November 7, 1916, the Penn State Department of Engineering Extension began offering evening classes for 150 students in what is now Coughlin High School. The new Penn State Department of Engineering Extension offered courses in advanced mathematics, surveying, reinforced concrete and mechanics. The campus began offering three-year certificates in mechanical, electrical, civil, and mining engineering by 1923; three-year courses in aeronautical and textile engineering and a two-year program in air conditioning were later added. During World War II, the renamed Pennsylvania State College Wilkes-Barre Technical School Center trained women and older men in the manufacture of war materials in order to replace younger men leaving to serve in the war. The non-credit, tuition-free, government sponsored college level courses trained workers already in war production to take over more highly skilled jobs. Until this time the school offered only evening courses in mechanical subjects; in 1947 demand from returning veterans inspired the school to introduce four daytime courses (business administration, building construction, industrial electricity, and mechanical and production tool design). In 1949, the Engineers' Council for Professional Development accredited the engineering courses offered by the school, and in 1953, the campus began offering its first 2-year program, an associate degree in engineering. In 1957, the associate degree in surveying technology was also approved. By 1971, the first two years of over 100 Penn State majors could be studied on the Wilkes-Barre campus, and in 1987, the campus offered its first baccalaureate degree: a B.S. in electrical engineering technology. In 1968 the school moved from a variety of downtown Wilkes-Barre buildings to its current rural/suburban campus, a 54-acre estate in Lehman, PA, donated for that purpose by Richard and Helen Robinson and originally owned by John and Bertha Conyngham. The estate included Hayfield House, an impressive stone mansion designed by the architect Francis Augustus Nelson, and built in the early 1930s. (Pictures of the furnished mansion were taken by well-known architectural photographer Samuel H. Gottscho in 1934; these images are held in the Gottscho-Schleisner collection at the U.S. Library of Congress.) Hayfield House was converted into administrative offices and classrooms, and the 19-car stone garage was turned into the Student Commons. The Penn State Wilkes-Barre Northern Tier Center, located in Towanda in Bradford County, was established in 1986 under the direction of the Penn State Wilkes-Barre Continuing Education department. Its mission is to extend the resources of the University to Bradford and Sullivan Counties, which are largely rural areas of Northeastern Pennsylvania not readily accessible to a Penn State campus. Athletics Penn State Wilkes- Barre teams participate as members of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA). The Nittany Lions are also a member of the Pennsylvania State University Athletic Conference (PSUAC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf and soccer; women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball and volleyball.

Its title is taken from the song of the same name, by Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston, which is played in the closing credits. The storyline is similar to the 1961 film The Parent Trap, which, in turn, is based on the 1949 book Lottie and Lisa by Erich K√§stner. The film was distributed by Warner Bros. through their Warner Bros. Family Entertainment label.  Plot  Amanda Lemmon is a 9-year-old orphan, and she is about to be adopted by the Butkises, a family known to \\"collect\\" kids. She actually wants Diane Barrows, the orphanage caretaker, to adopt her instead. Diane would like to do so, but authorities will not let her because of her low salary and unmarried status. While at summer camp, Amanda meets an identical girl named Alyssa Callaway, who has come home from boarding school, only to find that her wealthy father, Roger, the camp‚Äôs owner, is about to marry Clarice Kensington, an overbearing self-centered gold-digger socialite. The identical strangers soon become acquainted, long for the other's life and decide to switch places. While Amanda adapts to Alyssa's wealthy lifestyle and Alyssa gets to experience camp, the two get to know the other's parental figure and discover that Roger and Diane would be perfect for each other. Desperate to set them up, the girls arrange many meetings between Diane and Roger, hoping that they‚Äôll fall in love. Roger and Diane do seem to hit it off upon meeting, as Diane is pleasantly surprised with Roger's kind and humble nature despite his wealth, and Roger, with Diane's help, is able to work up the courage to visit the summer camp again, which he has not done since his first wife's death, due to the painful memories. Upon having spied Roger and Diane laughing and swimming together in the lake one afternoon, Clarice manipulates Roger into moving the wedding up from the next month to the next day and Amanda, while posing as Alyssa, finds out that Clarice plans on sending her off to boarding school in Tibet after marrying Roger. Meanwhile, Alyssa, while posing as Amanda, ends up being adopted by the Butkises without Diane's knowledge, and is taken away by child services. She then discovers the only reason the Butkises had adopted so many kids was to put them to work in their salvage yard. Roughly two hours before the wedding, Amanda proves to the family butler, Vincenzo, that she is not Alyssa. Vincenzo visits Diane at the orphanage and tells her about the switcheroo. Diane arrives at the Butkises‚Äô salvage yard via helicopter to pick up the real Alyssa and get her to the wedding. In the meantime, Vincenzo and Amanda work to stall the event. As Roger hesitates to say \\"I do,\\" he recalls all the good times he had with Diane and realizes that he has fallen in love with her. All of a sudden, Diane bursts into the church with Alyssa behind her. At that moment, Roger confesses his love for Diane to Clarice, who furiously slaps him and tries to do the same to \\"Alyssa,\\" blaming her for sabotaging their wedding, but is stopped by Vincenzo. As Clarice storms down the aisle, the real Alyssa steps out from behind Diane, and Clarice claims it as a \\"conspiracy\\" that there are two Alyssas. She tries to take this new opportunity to slap Alyssa, but Diane steps forward in time, barking at her, \\"Back off, Barbie,\\" and calmly informs her that she has something in her teeth. Humiliated, Clarice moves to storm out of the church again, but Alyssa deliberately steps on her wedding gown, causing the skirt to rip off. An incredulous Roger learns that Alyssa has been with Diane, while he had Amanda, all this time and it becomes apparent to the two that the girls had orchestrated their meet-ups all along, about which the girls themselves are extremely smug. After some encouragement from the girls, Roger and Diane share a kiss, and the four of them board a horse-drawn carriage, driven by Vincenzo, to take a ride through Central Park.

The Scranton campus was named in memory of Worthington Scranton, a prominent industrialist and civic leader of northeastern Pennsylvania. History In 1923, Pennsylvania State College (not yet a university) established a branch school in Scranton, offering evening technical institute programs. The school was renamed the Scranton Center in 1951 and became part of the General Extension division of the Penn State. In 1953, its courses were restructured as associate degree programs. The school left its first home at the Longfellow School Annex in Scranton in June 1968 and moved to the present site which was purchased with money raised through contributions from private citizens and local industries. The new campus opened in September 1968 as a member of Penn State's Commonwealth Campus System. The first campus baccalaureate degree program was offered in 1995 and on July 1, 1997, Scranton joined 11 other Penn State locations as a campus of the University's Commonwealth College.

He was first appointed to lead 40 allied ships in the Spartan expedition to Mytilene in 427 BC. This was part of a double movement meant to hinder the Athenians from sending help to Lesbos, the other part being an allied invasion of Attica. However, the rebellion of Mytilene was crushed before his force could arrive, largely due to the leisurely pace with which Alcidas led the fleet, and he was forced to put into Embatum in Erythrae seven days after the town capitulated. Alcidas was then urged by Teutiaplus, an Elean, to attack Mytilene anyway, as the Athenians would most assuredly be taken by surprise, but Alcidas acted with typical Spartan hesitance and refused. Trying another approach, some Ionian exiles advised him to capture a town in Ionia and use it as \\"a base for effecting the revolt of Ionia.\\" Thucydides states that this idea had merit, as the Spartans were \\"welcome everywhere\\", and the loss of Ionia would be a serious blow to Athenian resources. However, Alcidas refused this offer as well, as he \\"was eager to find himself back in Peloponnese as soon as possible\\". After these events Alcidas led his fleet to Cyllene and found that Brasidas had been sent to him in the capacity of \\"counsellor\\", showing the Spartan disapproval of his results at Lesbos. The Spartans then resolved to strengthen the fleet and send it to Corcyra where \\"a revolution had broken out\\" and to arrive speedily before the Athenians could send succor. Brasidas and Alcidas prepared accordingly, and together they defeated a fleet of Corcyrean ships, then fled when word reached them that 60 Athenian ships from Leucas under the command of Eurymedon had been dispatched to intercept them. Later, Alcidas was one of the three Spartans sent to found the colony of Heraclea in Trachis in 426 BC. Heraclea was \\"distant about four miles and a half from Thermopylae, and two miles and a quarter from the sea.\\" Thucydides states that the Spartans wished to found this colony \\"because it would lie conveniently for the purposes of the war against the Athenians. A fleet might be got ready there against Euboea...and the town would also be useful as a station on the road to Thrace.\\"  References  Primary Source * Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, Book III.

Grenier is a longtime CIA officer who served as the CIA's top counter-terrorism official (2004‚Äì2006). Career Grenier joined the CIA in January 1979 and worked field assignments in North Africa, Middle East and Western Europe till 1991. Grenier was station chief in Algiers, Algeria in 1990. He served as Special Assistant to the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff (1993‚Äì94) and first Chief of Operations, Counter-Proliferation Division (1994‚Äì96). From 1996 to 1999, Grenier was Director of Operational Training at Camp Peary, Virginia. Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq In 2001, Grenier was the CIA station chief in Islamabad, Pakistan, where he helped plan covert operations in support of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. In the summer of 2002 he was promoted to the chief of the Iraq Issues Group, where he helped coordinate covert operations in support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Grenier served as Director, CIA's Counterterrorist Center for about a year, but was fired from that position on 6 February 2006 by the Director of the National Clandestine Service Jose A. Rodriguez, Jr. . He was succeeded by Michael D‚ÄôAndrea. In 2006, Grenier joined Kroll, Inc., as Managing Director. CIA leak case and Libby trial In early 2006, Grenier was identified in court documents in connection with the CIA leak grand jury investigation and charges against I. Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby. Grenier told Libby on June 11, 2003, one month before the leak of Valerie Plame's CIA identity, that Ambassador Joseph Wilson's wife worked for the CIA and was involved in arranging Wilson's 2002 trip to Niger. Libby claims to have forgotten about the conversation. On January 24, 2006, Grenier testified in Libby's trial on perjury and obstruction of justice charges, telling jurors that Libby asked him for information about Joseph Wilson's investigatory trip to Niger on June 11, 2003, and that he reported back to Libby about Wilson's wife's involvement in the trip, as well as Wilson's wife's employment by the CIA, later on June 11. Grenier did not mention Plame's name to Libby, which appeared in a column by Robert Novak a month later. Grenier testified that it was unusual to get a call from Libby, and unusual to be called out of a meeting with CIA director George Tenet to supply Libby with answers. Wilson was sent on the February 2002 investigatory mission by the CIA, Grenier said, because the Office of the Vice President wanted answers about reports of uranium purchases from Niger, although the State Department and the Bureau of Intelligence and Research were interested in the CIA's take as well. Grenier testified that later media reports about the leak, which suggested Libby may have originally learned about Plame a month later from journalists, prompted him to contact CIA lawyers about his earlier conversations with Libby. According to Grenier, Libby thanked him personally a few days later for the information about Wilson's trip, telling him it had been \\"useful\\".

It was originally built as Magic Mountain in 1957‚Äì59 by a group spearheaded by prominent Wheat Ridge businessman Walter Francis Cobb and Denver sculptor John Calvin Sutton. They hired Marco Engineering, Inc., led by original Disneyland vice president C. V. Wood Jr., to build the theme park, the earliest known to have attempted to spread the theme park industry beyond Disneyland. Several veteran Hollywood art directors who worked on Disneyland created the design of Magic Mountain, led by MGM veteran Wade B. Rubottom and Disney veteran Dick Kelsey. The park is one of the world's foremost and best- preserved examples of Storybook design, a form of architecture translating to real life the stage and cinematic arts. Although Magic Mountain collapsed in 1960, it was eventually reopened by Woodmoor Corporation as Heritage Square in 1971. It featured a collection of artisan shops, children's rides, the second alpine slide outside a ski resort in North America, the Heritage Square Music Hall, Rio Golden train, and more. Admission was free, and it was open year- round. While much of Heritage Square closed after the 2015 season, the Victorian Event Center and The Amusement Park, including the Garden Grill and picnic areas, remained open temporarily. The park officially closed on June 30, 2018. Beginnings as Magic Mountain Walter Francis Cobb, noting the great possibilities of family entertainment that the theme park concept had to offer, teamed up in 1952 with John Calvin Sutton to create such a place for Denver-area residents to enjoy. The great success of Disneyland further fueled their ambitions, and in May 1957 they incorporated Magic Mountain, Inc., a stock offering company, for investment to build the new theme park. South Table Mountain site At first the new theme park targeted as a building site the northeastern alcove of South Table Mountain, just east of Golden, Colorado, and purchased of land to do so. The park's original concept at this location included a rainbow gateway guarded by giant genies, an enchanted forest, a Queen's Castle towering atop the mountain with an Old World court and fountains, themed refreshment stands including a pumpkin, polar bear and locomotive, serving snacks via miniature train, a seafood ship, and a monorail. However, this site met with sharp and unexpected opposition from the nearby residents of the new subdivision of Applewood, who objected to the impact of the development, including traffic and building on the scenic mountain. Cobb soon complied with the community's wishes and walked away to an alternative location. Eventually this original location would become partly Rolling Hills Country Club and (upon the mountain) preserved scenic open space. Apex site The new site selected for Magic Mountain was at the foot of the mountains at Apex Gulch southwest of Golden. During the Colorado Gold Rush, this had been part of the site of Apex, an early base camp community at an important crossroads of thoroughfares leading to the gold fields, including the Apex Road, which led up the gulch. At the same time, Cobb learned of the new theme park creating firm of Marco Engineering, Inc., formed by Cornelius Vanderbilt Wood, and hired them to design Magic Mountain at this location. Among the members of Wood's firm were several veteran Hollywood art directors, including some who had worked on Disneyland itself. The lead designers for Magic Mountain were Wade B. Rubottom and Richmond (Dick) Kelsey. Themed areas and attractions In the design dreamed up for Magic Mountain, the park was based on Colorado history, development and future. It was to be surrounded by an authentic narrow gauge train of the type historic to Golden and the Colorado mountains, and the park included 6 themed areas: * Cavalry Post and Stockade (frontier protection for settlers) * Centennial City (Old West downtown) * Fairgrounds (amusement facilities including a Mine Ride and Creation of the Earth Ride) * Forest River (mountaineers, American Indians and fur traders) * Magic of Industry (story of industrial progress in the American west including Outer Space Lines ride) * Storybook Lane (fairy tale land for younger visitors) Magic Mountain also was to include a ski slope upon Jackson Hill to its west. Construction and demise In 1957‚Äì59, the core of Magic Mountain was built, including the Magic Mountain Railroad, Cavalry Post and Stockade, and Centennial City. The historic Eden Palais, one of the largest carousel rides in the world, was shipped in and put to use here. However, financial difficulties began to arise and further plans were changed or scaled back. One building of the Fairgrounds was built, the Forest River Ride area created in altered form, and Storybook Lane and Magic of Industry scrapped altogether. Arguably the most ambitious part did materialize, the Magic Mountain ski area, scaled down to a rope tow instead of a ski lift, but nevertheless one of the first ski areas in North America to be operated with artificial snow. The ski area was successful; unfortunately the theme park was not. After opening to the public in 1959, it encountered continued financial difficulties and ultimately closed in 1960. Famed New York City developer William Zeckendorf, and Cobb himself (who was not blamed for its financial downfall), attempted to save the park, but its fate was inexorable and its components auctioned off. Its rides went to newly forming Six Flags Over Texas, while the core complex stood idle for some time. Rebirth as Heritage Square The alpine slide on Jackson Hill. In 1970, the Woodmoor Corporation acquired Magic Mountain and set about to resurrect the park as Heritage Square, a theme shopping village of artisan shops and attractions. Opening in 1971, it featured several popular places, including the Metal Master, General Store, Glassblower, Gasthaus beer garden restaurant, and Cedar Chest. A group of comedy melodramatic players formed in Estes Park led by G. William Oakley took possession of the Magic Mountain Play House in 1972, as the Heritage Square Players, and opened the Heritage Square Opera House. In 1973, they retrofitted the building across the main thoroughfare for an auditorium theater, while the Christmas Tree shop opened nearby, one of the first year-round Christmas shops in the country. Also that year, upon Jackson Hill, the second alpine slide outside a ski resort in North America was built, which became another noted attraction. A historic Lakewood schoolhouse was moved to the head of the main street and became Heritage Square's wedding chapel. The former schoolhouse, Wedding Bell Chapel. In 1988, the Opera House was reborn under direction of actor T.J. Mullin as the Heritage Square Music Hall, which was one of the most popular dinner theater establishments in Colorado until its closure in 2013. Storybook architecture Heritage Square is noted for being among the world's best preserved examples of a unique and artistic form of design born of the screen and stage arts. Storybook design, as it has become known, translates screen buildings to real life using architectural embellishments, whimsical distortions and forced perspective to make the buildings appear taller or larger than they really are (the buildings and blocks are 2/3 scale of their historic downtown Golden counterparts). Kelsey and Rubottom thoroughly studied and drew upon historic Colorado styles to translate into this medium, including several historically used in Golden and the Denver area, such as Second Empire, Gothic Revival, Pueblo Revival, Dutch Colonial Revival, frontier log building design and more. It gave the feeling of an old west town which was friendly to children and other patrons through its creative and artistic design, unusually ornate and hand carved on site. Current ownership An abandoned area with vacant buildings one block over from \\"Main Street\\". Over the years, Heritage Square's ownership has changed hands many times. Currently, Heritage Square is owned by Martin Marietta Corporation, which also owns the quarry next to the complex. Previous ownership was Lafarge, which bought Heritage Square early in the 1990s and currently runs the complex in the red as a tax writeoff and a buffer to the City of Golden. By using Heritage Square as a buffer to the city, Lafarge is able to prevent development near their active quarry and give room from the sound of the blasts used to break apart the rock. On quiet days, one can hear and even feel the blasts from the park. Following the 2015 season, the Alpine Slide and the Town closed. Miner's Maze and the Church were relocated. The Amusement Park at Heritage Square, including the Garden Grill, the Corporate Picnic Areas and the Victorian Event Center, remained open until 2018.http://www.heritageamusementpark.com/ Amusement park The Amusement Park at Heritage Square featured the following kiddie rides; Swings, Balloon Ride, Banana Squadron, Carousel, Crazy Bus, Himalaya, Miner Mike Roller Coaster, Python Pit Roller Coaster, Tea Cups, Tilt-a-Whirl, Scrambler and Ferris Wheel. In addition to these attractions are both non-squirting bumper and swan shaped paddle boats. In the summer of 2012, the Amusement Park at Heritage Square also added a space shuttle and a zipline in 2013. The summer of 2013 also saw the removal of kiddie go-karts. The park also features junior, adult and slick track Go-Carts. Special features include pony rides on weekends and holidays. The Amusement Park at Heritage Square is independent of the Rio Golden Railroad, Miners Maze Adventureland and the Alpine Slide.

A right-handed opening batsman, Virgin had a mostly solid but unspectacular career in first- class cricket, except for two individual seasons, one for each of his two counties, during which he looked as good as any opening batsman in county cricket and was mentioned as a possible Test player. Virgin played first for Somerset in 1957 and was a regular as an opening batsman in 1960, when he scored 1,453 runs at a respectable average of 25 runs per innings. He reappeared in 1963 after National Service and was a regular in the Somerset side for the rest of the 1960s, usually scoring his 1,000 runs a season, but only once averaging more than 30 runs an innings. But then, suddenly, in 1970, Virgin's batting moved into a different league. Revealing a wider range of shots than before, he scored fast and prolifically, with 2,223 runs at an average of 47 in the season, including seven centuries. He was talked of as a possible England opener and was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 1971 edition of the almanack. The 1971 season was another successful year for Virgin, but in 1972 his runmaking fell away badly, and he left Somerset at the end of the season. The parting was not amicable. Virgin had to wait half a season before he could make his County Championship debut in 1973 for Northamptonshire and then he had limited success. But in 1974, he had a second season of high achievement: 1,936 runs at an average of almost 57 runs per innings meant that he was fifth in the national averages. Again, he was talked of as a potential England player; but again he was not selected. Virgin was appointed captain of Northamptonshire in 1975, but resigned in August, saying that the captaincy was affecting his batting. He barely made his 1,000 runs that season, but recovered to average 34 in the 1976 season. Batting with Peter Willey he scored 145 in a fourth wicket stand of 370 against Somerset at Northampton, which remains the county record for a fourth wicket partnership. But after a less successful season in 1977 he retired to take up a business appointment. Early in his career, Virgin occasionally acted as wicketkeeper in first-class matches, and he continued to do so occasionally in one-day matches throughout his career. More often, he was a reliable catcher in the slips and his 42 catches for Somerset in 1966 remains the county record. Virgin married Margaret Ann Thresher in 1960 and had three children (Steve, Dave and Andy) and five grandchildren (Heather, Hayley, Matt, Arran and Olivia). He has two brothers and two sisters. (Brian, Sid, Maureen and Helen). In December 2019 Roy became a Great-Grandfather to Frederick Roy Virgin who is Matt + Beth's son. Frederick's middle name was indeed named after Roy himself.

His best season was in 1990, when he caught 34 passes for 464 yards and 5 touchdowns.

It can also be used to describe the period or season during which such runoff is produced. Water produced by snowmelt is an important part of the annual water cycle in many parts of the world, in some cases contributing high fractions of the annual runoff in a watershed. Predicting snowmelt runoff from a drainage basin may be a part of designing water control projects. Rapid snowmelt can cause flooding. If the snowmelt is then frozen, very dangerous conditions and accidents can occur, introducing the need for salt to melt the ice. Energy fluxes related to snowmelt Vegetation gives off heat, resulting in this circular snowmelt pattern. There are several energy fluxes involved in the melting of snow. These fluxes can act in opposing directions, that is either delivering heat to or removing heat from the snowpack. Ground heat flux is the energy delivered to the snowpack from the soil below by conduction. Radiation inputs to the snowpack include net shortwave (solar radiation including visible and ultraviolet light) and longwave (infrared) radiation. Net shortwave radiation is the difference in energy received from the sun and that reflected by the snowpack because of the snowpack albedo. Longwave radiation is received by the snowpack from many sources, including ozone, carbon dioxide, and water vapor present in all levels of the atmosphere. Longwave radiation is also emitted by the snowpack in the form near-Black-body radiation, where snow has an emissivity between 0.97 and 1.0. Generally the net longwave radiation term is negative, meaning a net loss of energy from the snowpack. Latent temperature flux is the energy removed from or delivered to the snowpack which accompanies the mass transfers of evaporation, sublimation, or condensation. Sensible heat flux is the heat flux due to convection between the air and snowpack. Thaw circles around tree trunks Tree trunks absorbing sunlight become warmer than the air and cause earlier melting of snow around them. The snow does not melt slower gradually with distance from the trunk, but creates a wall surrounding snow-free ground around it rather. According to some of sources, North American spring ephermal plants like spring beauty (Claytonia caroliniana), trout lily (Erythronium americanum) and red trillium (Trillium erectum L.) benefit from such thaw circle. They can emerge earlier inside these circles, what gives them more time before development of tree canopy foliage cutting off significant portion of the light. They perform nearly all of their yearly photosynthesis during this period. Evergreen trees tend to produce larger thaw circles than deciduous trees. This involves largely a different mechanism and spring ephemeral plants don't occur there. The snow melts earlier in forest also for example on microtopographic mounds (small elevations) or in wet places like edges of creeks or in seeps. These microsites affect distribution of many herbs too. Historical cases In northern Alaska, the melt-date has advanced by 8 days since the mid-1960s. Decreased snowfall in winter followed by warmer spring conditions seems to be the cause for the advance. In Europe, the 2012 heat wave has especially been anomalous at higher altitudes. For the first time on record, some of the highest Alpine peaks in Europe were snow- free. Although it would seem that the two were related, the question of how much of this is due to climate change firmly remains a center of debate. Snowmelt flowing into lake at Okanagan Mountain Provincial Park Increased water runoff due to snowmelt was a cause of many famous floods. One well-known example is the Red River Flood of 1997, when the Red River of the North in the Red River Valley of the United States and Canada flooded. Flooding in the Red River Valley is augmented by the fact that the river flows north through Winnipeg, Manitoba and into Lake Winnipeg. As snow in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota begins to melt and flow into the Red River, the presence of downstream ice can act as a dam and force upstream water to rise. Colder temperatures downstream can also potentially lead to freezing of water as it flows north, thus augmenting the ice dam problem. Some areas in British Columbia are also prone to snowmelt flooding as well. Scholarly conversation The date of annual melt is of great interest as a potential indicator of climate change. In order to determine whether the earlier disappearance of spring snow cover in northern Alaska is related to global warming versus an appearance of a more natural, continual cycle of the climate, further study and monitoring is necessary. Large year-to-year variability complicates the picture and furthers the debate. Inter-annual variability of springtime snow pack comes largely from variability of winter month precipitation which is in turn related to the variability of key patterns of atmospheric circulation. A study of the mountains in the western United States show a region wide decline in spring snow-pack since the mid-1900s, dominated by loss at low elevations where winter temperatures are near freezing. These losses are an indication of increased temperatures which lead to snow loss via some combination of increased regularity of rain versus snow and increased melting during winter months. These natural variations make it challenging to quantify trends with confidence, to deduce observed changes to predict future climate, or to clearly detect changes in snow-pack due to human impact on warming trends.

Founded on October 18, 1918, The Ubyssey is the most read student-run paper in Canada. Notable writers throughout its history include Pierre Berton, John Turner, Allan Fotheringham, Michael Valpy, Joe Schlesinger, Danny Stoffman, Stephen Scobie, Vaughn Palmer, Bruce Arthur, and Earle Birney. Other notable alumni include cartoonist Arn Saba, journalist and author Katherine Monk, and photographers Jeff Wall and Richard Lam. The Ubyssey is an independent publication funded by a $6.89 annual fee, from which students can opt out. The staff functions as a collective; current UBC students who have contributed to the paper and attend staff meetings are eligible to become staff members. The staff elects the full-time editors on an annual basis. The Ubyssey Publications Society board and president, who deal chiefly with management of the business affairs of the paper and do not play any editorial role, are elected by the general student body annually. Publication The Ubyssey is primarily web-based, but regular issues of the print edition appear once a week from September to April (except during exams or the Christmas break). Publishing during the summer term varies. In 2016 one print issue was produced per month, as well as two in August, but summer editions were not published in some years. The Ubyssey also maintains a web site with web-only news and video content. The paper runs several recurring special issues including a guide for incoming students to on-campus life, and two satire issues. The frequency of publication has varied historically. The paper was published four times a week in 1947, but this only lasted one year. Until the 1980s, there were three issues per week, with Monday and Thursday issues being a standard, university news-oriented edition while The Ubyssey Magazine or \\"Page Friday\\" was published on Fridays. History Ubyssey, October 17, 1918 The first issue of The Ubyssey was printed on October 17, 1918. Over the years the paper took stances supporting the demands for the building of UBC campus at Point Grey and the right of Japanese-Canadians to continue their studies after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It also spoke out against fraternity hazing, which was banned on campus in 1924, and racist policies at some fraternities were exposed in the paper by Allan FotheringhamHawthorn, T. The Ubyssey marks a checkered past. The Globe and Mail, 22 October 2008. in the 1950s. In 1955 The Ubyssey was ranked the student publication with the most freedom and least faculty control in Canada. Rev. E. C. Pappert was then the faculty advisor with direct editorial control over the student newspaper at Assumption College in Windsor, which had been ranked bottom in that survey. Pappert's response was that ‚ÄúThe Ubyssey is the vilest rag you can imagine and is the best argument for censorship that could be produced.‚Äù The Ubyssey embraced Pappert's remarks and adopted ‚Äúthe vilest rag west of Blanca‚Äù as its unofficial slogan. Ubyssey, March 20, 1919 Irreverence and controversy have indeed been part of The Ubyssey's history. In 1959 the entire staff was fired by the Alma Mater Society (AMS) when a photo was published during the Easter period showing a UBC student crucified on a totem pole. The last issue of the fall term satirizes campus issues and news stories. The spoof issue, published closest to April 1 spoofs another publication. Recent examples included The Grope and Flail, The Georgian Taint, Sports Inundated, Breitbarf, and a nude calendar spoofing a fundraising effort by the UBC men's rugby team. In 1974, a report, quoting the Pope, that Patty Hearst had given a speech to students in the Totem Park cafeteria prompted the arrival on campus of a KOMO-TV news team from Seattle which had taken it seriously. Shutdown by the AMS Although The Ubyssey was at arm's length from the Alma Mater Society (AMS), it was still part of and published by the student union while one of its main roles was to report on the AMS's activities. At the same time, the AMS was forced to spend money to fight lawsuits on behalf of a media outlet from which it was continually fending off criticism.Higgins, K. & McElroy, J. From the penthouse to the basement and everything in between: The Ubyssey from 1995 to 2008. The Ubyssey Publications Board, 2008. This tension emerged in the early 1990s when disputes over editorial control led to the suspension of publication in the summer of 1993, when the AMS created a new \\"Publications Board\\" with power over the previously autonomous Ubyssey staff collective. The paper's staff eventually decided to work with the new board and resumed publication for the 1993‚Äì1994 school year, but its relationship with the AMS executive only deteriorated during this time with the paper vociferously criticizing the student union on a regular basis and attracting accusations of leftist bias. The controversies came to a head when the annual spoof issue was published on March 30, 1994. ‚ÄùThe Ufeces‚Äù was a self-parody pushing the newspaper staff's own positions to extremes and satirizing their own conflicts with the union. It featured a satirical full-page ad suggesting that the AMS was self-serving, played favourites with clubs and did not care about students, and contained photographs of a female AMS executive in suggestive poses. This proved the final straw, and the AMS council passed a motion to give itself the sole power to choose the paper's editor-in-chief, who would then select all other editors. The AMS's hired editors, however, were unable to produce a paper as staff refused to cooperate. The AMS then changed the locks to the offices, shutting down The Ubyssey. The fired editors, along with some UBC students, mobilized in response, campaigning to revive the paper. They formed the nonprofit Ubyssey Publications Society and placed a referendum question on the AMS elections ballot on reviving the paper as an independent entity, funded by a $5 fee from which students could opt out. Although there was concern about having enough votes cast to reach the quorum requirement, the referendum to revive The Ubyssey passed on January 24, 1995 with 67 per cent in favour. The first issue of the newly independent Ubyssey was published on July 13, 1995. The Ubyssey also agreed to relocate its offices from the top floor to the basement of the Student Union Building once space became available, a move which was completed in 2001. APEC to the 21st century The Ubyssey played an important role in coverage of the protests which accompanied the holding of the 1997 APEC summit on UBC campus. Photo editor Richard Lam's photograph of RCMP officer Hugh Stewart pepper spraying protesters became iconic with Stewart becoming known as ‚ÄúSergeant Pepper‚Äù and later being summoned to testify at a public inquiry into the police handling of the protests.CBC News. Sgt. Pepper defends spraying APEC protesters. Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 3 December 1999. Another major issue tackled by the paper in the 1990s was the ten-year exclusivity deal reached in 1995 between Coca-Cola, UBC, and the AMS allowing only Coca-Cola soft drinks to be sold on campus. The Ubyssey fought to force details of the confidential deal to be made public through a freedom of information request which was denied on the basis that it would harm the university's financial interests. The Ubyssey filed a lawsuit and the case eventually reached the Supreme Court of British Columbia which overturned the initial decision, with the deal finally being made public in May 2001.Jonathan Woodward. \\"Coke's deal refuels kerfuffle at UBC\\". The Globe and Mail, 1 September 2005. In 2011, the student fee funding The Ubyssey was increased by referendum to $6 per student with an annual increase tied to inflation. The paper's reporting on a chant condoning non-consensual sex during Commerce Undergraduate Society (CUS) orientation activities in September 2013 led to the resignation of CUS executives, an investigation by UBC, and helped publicize similar incidents at other universities.CBC News. \\"UBC investigates frosh students' pro-rape chant\\", Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 9 September 2013. With the completion of the AMS Nest in 2015, The Ubyssey offices moved into the new student union building.

Following his playing career, Metzelaars became a coach. High school and college He played high school football at Portage Central High School in Portage, Michigan, and played college football at Wabash College, graduating from Wabash in 1982. While at Wabash, he played for an undefeated football team, while also leading the basketball team to the NCAA Division III national championship as a senior and being named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. During his senior year, he earned Academic All-American honors In football, he was coached by Stan Parrish and in basketball coached by legendary basketball coach Mac Petty. NFL career He was taken in the 3rd round with the 75th pick by Seattle in the 1982 NFL Draft. He played for three seasons in Seattle before being traded to the Bills in 1985. When Jim Kelly joined the Bills in 1986, Metzelaars became a productive part of the offense. He played with the Bills in their 4 Super Bowl losses from 1990‚Äì1993, and scored a touchdown in Super Bowl XXVI. Metzelaars' best season was in 1993, when he caught 68 passes for 609 yards and 4 touchdowns. He was not re-signed by the Bills after the 1994 season. He signed a three-year, $2.4 million deal. to play with the Carolina Panthers. He caught the first touchdown pass in Carolina franchise history, but only played one season for them. He finished his career by playing two seasons for the Detroit Lions, starting in 17 of the 31 games he appeared in while splitting time with David Sloan. The Lions offensive coordinator in 1996 was Tom Moore. Metzelaars would go on to work alongside Moore later in their careers. Metzelaars finished his 16 NFL seasons with 383 receptions for 3,686 yards and 29 touchdowns in 235 games. At the time of his retirement, his 235 games were the most ever played by a tight end in NFL history. Coaching After retiring, Metzelaars moved into the coaching ranks as the offensive coordinator at Charlotte Christian School from 1998-2002. In 2003, Metzelaars joined Wingate University as an assistant offensive coach but also served in NFL Europe with Barcelona during the off- season. He also was an intern with the Indianapolis Colts during their 2003 training camp, assisting with the tight ends under Offensive Coordinator Tom Moore. In 2004, Metzelaars joined the Colts staff full-time as the offensive quality control coach. After reaching four Super Bowls (and failing to win) with the Buffalo Bills as a player, he finally won a ring with the Colts' triumph in Super Bowl XLI. In 2012, Metzelaars joined the Buffalo Bills staff full-time as the tight ends coach. He, along with the entire Bills coaching staff, was dismissed on December 31, 2012. On January 24, 2014 Metzelaars became Tight Ends coach for the San Diego Chargers, replacing Jason Michael who left to be Offensive coordinator at the Tennessee Titans. He was reunited with former Buffalo Bills teammate Frank Reich, who was promoted to be the Chargers' new Offensive coordinator. In 2018, Metzelaars became the offensive line coach for the Atlanta Legends of the newly-formed Alliance of American Football. Personal life Metzelaars and his wife, Barbara, have two sons: Anthony and Jonathan. In 2011, Metzelaars was inducted into the Academic All- American Hall of Fame.

The concept was implemented on a large scale by David H. Geiger with the United States pavilion at Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan in 1970. It is usually dome-shaped, since this shape creates the greatest volume for the least amount of material. To maintain structural integrity, the structure must be pressurized such that the internal pressure equals or exceeds any external pressure being applied to the structure (i.e. wind pressure). The structure does not have to be airtight to retain structural integrity‚Äîas long as the pressurization system that supplies internal pressure replaces any air leakage, the structure will remain stable. All access to the structure interior must be equipped with some form of airlock‚Äîtypically either two sets of parallel doors or a revolving door or both. Air-supported structures are secured by heavy weights on the ground, ground anchors, attachment to a foundation, or a combination of these. Among its many uses are: sports and recreation facilities, warehousing, temporary shelters, and radomes. The structure can be either wholly, partial, or roof-only air supported. A fully air-supported structure can be intended to be a temporary or semi-temporary facility or permanent, whereas a structure with only an air- supported roof can be built as a permanent building. What will be the largest air-supported dome in the world is currently being constructed on the IBM campus in East Fishkill, New York. Scheduled to open in 2019 (delayed twice), the Sports KingDome will feature a high ceiling and of training space for athletics. Design=Shape The shape of an air-supported structure is limited by the need to have the whole envelope surface evenly pressurized. If this is not the case, the structure will be unevenly supported, creating wrinkles and stress points in the pliable envelope which in turn may cause it to fail. In practice, any inflated surface involves a double curvature. Therefore, the most common shapes for air-supported structures are hemispheres, ovals, and half cylinders. Structure The main loads acting against the air-supported envelope are internal air pressure, wind, or weight from snow build-up. To compensate against wind force and snow load, the structure's inflation is adjusted accordingly. Modern structures have computer controlled mechanical systems that monitor dynamic loads and automatically compensate the inflation for it. The better the quality of the structure, the higher forces and weight it can endure. The best quality structures can withstand winds up to and snow weight to 40 pounds per square yard (21.7 kilograms per square meter). The interior of the Tokyo Dome exemplifies how large an area can be spanned with an air-supported roof. The air pressure on the envelope is equal to the air pressure exerted on the inside ground, pushing the whole structure up. Therefore, it needs to be securely anchored to the ground (or to the substructure in a roof-only design). For wide span structures cables are required for anchoring and stabilization. Anchoring requires ballast (weights). Early anchoring designs incorporated sand bags, concrete blocks, bricks, or the like, typically placed around the perimeter on the seal skirt. Most modern design structures use proprietary anchoring systems. The danger of sudden collapse is nearly negligible, because the structure will gradually deform or sag when subject to a heavy load or force (snow or wind). Only if these warning signs are ignored or not noticed, then the build-up of an extreme load may rupture the envelope, leading to a sudden deflation and collapse. A common misconception is that these structures are not meant to be permanent facilities, however all major corporations participating in this industry conform to some form of The International Building Codes. To be a permanent facility these domes have to be engineered to the same building codes as a traditional structure. Air-supported structures or domes are also commonly known as \\"bubbles\\". Material The materials used for air-supported structures are similar to those used in tensile structures, namely synthetic fabrics such as fibreglass and polyester. In order to prevent deterioration from moisture and ultraviolet radiation, these materials are coated with polymers such as PVC and Teflon. Depending on use and location, the structure may have inner linings made of lighter materials for insulation or acoustics. Materials used in modern air supported structures are usually translucent, therefore the use of lighting system inside the structure is not required during the daytime. Air pressure The interior air pressure required for air-supported structures is not as much as most people expect and certainly not discernible when inside. The amount of pressure required is a function of the weight of the material - and the building systems suspended on it (lighting, ventilation, etc.) - and wind pressure. Yet it only amounts to a small fraction of atmospheric pressure. Internal pressure is commonly measured in inches of water, inAq, and varies fractionally from 0.3 inAq for minimal inflation to 3 inAq for maximum, with 1 inAq being a standard pressurization level for normal operating conditions. In terms of the more common pounds per square inch, 1 inAq equates to a mere 0.037 psi (2.54 mBar, 254 Pa).

The film was an international co-production between the United States, China, Hong Kong, and Canada. It stars Angus Macfadyen, Mario Yedidia, Marley Shelton, and Chao-Li Chi. The film was based on a series of characters created by the Chinese-American Law brothers, four siblings who worked as physicians and had no prior filmmaking experience. The story follows a young boy (Yedidia) who stumbles into a mystical world based on the Tao Te Ching, where he meets the titular Warriors of Virtue - anthropomorphic kangaroo who wield the powers of Tao and battle the evil warlord Komodo (Macfayden). The Irish band Clannad provided the original score, \\"Forces of Nature\\". The film was a critical and commercial failure. It was followed by a direct-to-video sequel, Warriors of Virtue: The Return to Tao, in 2002. Plot Ryan Jeffers suffers a disability to his leg preventing him from trying out for sports and fitting in with other kids at school. He is currently the waterboy of his school's football team and has a crush on quarterback Brad's girlfriend. He often seeks escape through comic books and dreams of adventure, hiding the depression of his disability from his mother Kathryn. One day, the owner of his favorite restaurant, his friend Ming, gives him a manuscript of Tao representing the five elements: Earth, Fire, Water, Wood and Metal. He advises Ryan to live his life no matter his physical limits. That night, Ryan and his best friend Chucky are approached by Brad and his friends who suggest an initiation for their group. Leading them to a water plant, Ryan is told he needs to cross a narrow pipe in order to sign his name on a wall of graffiti. Chucky recommends to Ryan, \\"why don't we make like Tom, and Cruise?\\" Ignoring Chucky's protests, Ryan attempts to cross the pipe. During this time, a water pipe opens up and throws Ryan into the water. Ryan wakes in a strange forest and is attacked by assailants who are drawn off by a creature from the lake. He screams and runs in fear, but soon realizes his leg works. He meets a dwarf-like man named Mudlap where a beautiful girl named Elysia drives him off. She tells Ryan that he is in Tao. Ryan tells her about the manuscript, which had been stolen with his backpack. Believing it to be the Manuscript of Legend, Elysia takes Ryan to Master Chung and he meets four of the five warriors, anthropomorphic kangaroos each representing an element: Lai, Warrior of Wood; Chi, Warrior of Fire; Tsun, Warrior of Earth; and Yee, Warrior of Metal. He is told that Yun, the Warrior of Water had left them following an earlier conflict. Ryan thinks that the creature that saved him is Yun and that he has the manuscript. He is told that the manuscript would be sought by Komodo, a warlord who betrayed the Warriors and is stealing from the Lifesprings of Tao in order to stay young forever where the Warriors are protecting the last Lifespring. While talking to Elysia, Ryan is captured by Mantose, Barbarocious, and Dullard, but is saved by Yun who admits he doesn't have the book leading Ryan to believe Komodo has it. He convinces Yun to return to the Lifespring. Ryan flees, wanting to return home, but Mudlap leads him into General Grillo's arms and he is saved by Chung. Yun, Yee and Chi go after the manuscript and fall into a trap after being betrayed by Elysia, who joined Komodo as vengeance against Yun for killing her brother by accident. They are nearly killed in a trap, but narrowly escape using their skills and they return to the Lifespring to prevent Komodo from ambushing the others. Komodo attempts to kidnap Ryan, but instead fights Chung. The battle is brutal, but Chung is defeated and killed by Komodo who then makes off with Ryan. When Ryan awakens at Komodo's palace, Elysia explains of Yun killing her brother and tries to convince him to read from the book so that Komodo could possibly invade his world for more Lifesprings. Ryan realizes he can't read the book and this upsets Komodo, who tries to strike Ryan down. Elysia interferes and is struck down by Barbarocious. Komodo kills Barbarocious in rage as Ryan escapes. Komodo, now growing unhinged, returns to the Lifespring and challenges the Warriors to one-on-one combat, splitting into five versions of himself. He taunts and defeats the warriors while Ryan, after getting an apology from Mudlap for his betrayal, finds an inscription in the manuscript. Facing Komodo and taunting him, Ryan tricks Komodo into using his power on him, weakening him so that the warriors can use their powers to purify his spirit, reforming him to a kind man while purifying his surviving army. Ryan, now mortally wounded, is surrounded by his friends and Yee astonishes his comrades by thanking Ryan as he speaks for the first time in many years. Suddenly, Ryan is back at the water plant before crossing the pipe. Realizing his desperation to fit in led to his accident, he changes it this time and refusing to go through with it. The water pipe opens like it did before, trapping Brad on the other side. His insults to his friends only prompt them to leave him behind for the police to find. That night at home, Ryan apologizes to his mother for an earlier argument. When he goes to bed, he offers to tell his dog, Bravo, about Tao.

It includes a broad group of diseases, including occupational asthma, industrial bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiolitis obliterans, inhalation injury, interstitial lung diseases (such as pneumoconiosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, lung fibrosis), infections, lung cancer and mesothelioma. These diseases can be caused directly or due to immunological response to an exposure to a variety of dusts, chemicals, proteins or organisms. Occupational cases of interstitial lung disease may be misdiagnosed as COPD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or a myriad of other diseases; leading to a delay in identification of the causative agent. Types of occupational lung diseases=Asthma Asthma is a respiratory disease that can begin or worsen due to exposure at work and is characterized by episodic narrowing of the respiratory tract. Occupational asthma has a variety of causes, including sensitization to a specific substance, causing an allergic response; or a reaction to an irritant that is inhaled in the workplace. Exposure to various substances can also worsen pre- existing asthma. People who work in isocyanate manufacturing, who use latex gloves, or who work in an indoor office environment are at higher risk for occupational asthma than the average US worker. Approximately 2 million people in the US have occupational asthma. Bronchiolitis obliterans Bronchiolitis obliterans, also known as constrictive bronchiolitis or obliterative bronchiolitis is a respiratory disease caused by injury to the smallest airways, called bronchioles. It has been reported to occur from exposure to inhaled toxins and gases including sulfur mustard gas, nitrogen oxides, diacetyl (used in many food and beverage flavorings), 2,3-pentanedione, fly ash and fiberglass. COPD Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a respiratory disease that can encompass chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. 15% of the cases of COPD in the United States can be attributed to occupational exposure, including exposure to silica and coal dust. People who work in mining, construction, manufacturing (specifically textiles, rubber, plastic, and leather), building, and utilities are at higher risk for COPD than the average US worker. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP; also called allergic alveolitis, bagpipe lung, or extrinsic allergic alveolitis, EAA) is an inflammation of the alveoli within the lung caused by hypersensitivity to inhaled organic dusts. Lung cancer Numerous categories of ionizing radiation, chemicals and mixtures, occupational exposures, metals, dust and fibers have been linked to occurrence of lung cancer. Mesothelioma Mesothelioma is a cancer of the mesothelium, part of which is the pleura, the lining of the lungs. Mesothelioma is caused by exposure to asbestos. Pneumoconiosis Pneumoconiosis are occupational lung diseases that are caused due to accumulation of dust in the lungs and body's reaction to its presence. Most common pneumoconiosis are silicosis, coal workers‚Äô pneumoconiosis (CWP), and asbestosis. Other examples include minerals (such kaolin, talc, mica), beryllium lung disease, hard metal disease and silicon carbide pneumoconiosis. Occupational environmental exposure=Arsenic Arsenic is classified as an IARC Group 1 carcinogen and is a cause of lung cancer. Workers can be exposed to arsenic through work with some pesticides or in copper smelting. Asbestos Asbestos is a mineral which was extensively used in the United States to fireproof buildings and textiles, among other items, in the 1950s-1980s. Workers are frequently exposed to asbestos during demolition and renovation work, which can cause asbestosis and/or mesothelioma. Asbestos exposure can also cause pleural effusion, diffuse pleural fibrosis, pleural plaques, and non-mesothelioma lung cancer. Smoking greatly increases the lung cancer risk of asbestos exposure. Residents and workers of asbestos mining centers such as the town of Asbest, Russia suffer dangerous exposure to asbestos and asbestos dust. BCME BCME (Bis(chloromethyl) ether) is associated with small cell lung cancer in workers who have been exposed. Exposure can occur via direct manufacture of BCME or its presence as a byproduct. Beryllium Beryllium is classified as an IARC Group 1 carcinogen and can also cause interstitial lung disease. Manufacturing workers, dental technicians, machinists, jewelers, plumbers, electricians, precious metal reclamation workers, and welders are at risk for beryllium exposure. Cadmium Cadmium is classified as an IARC Group 1 carcinogen and it is a cause of several cancers, including lung cancer. Workers can be exposed to cadmium through welding, zinc smelting, copper smelting, lead smelting, electroplating, battery manufacture, plastics manufacture, and in alloying. Chromium Chromium is classified as an IARC Group 1 carcinogen and is linked to lung cancer. Workers can be exposed to chromium via welding, steel manufacturing, pigment/dye manufacturing, and electroplating. Coal dust Exposure to coal dust is the cause of coalworker's pneumoconiosis, also called \\"black lung disease\\", is an interstitial lung disease caused by long-term exposure (over 10 years) to coal dust. Symptoms include shortness of breath and lowered pulmonary function. It can be fatal when advanced. Between 1970‚Äì1974, prevalence of CWP among US coal miners who had worked over 25 years was 32%; the same group saw a prevalence of 9% in 2005‚Äì2006.It can also exacerbate or cause COPD. Diesel exhaust Diesel exhaust contains a variety of gaseous and particulate chemicals, including soot, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and other known carcinogens. Flock Flocking is the technique of adding small pieces of nylon or other material to a backing, usually a textile, to create a contrasting texture. Inhalation of flock can cause flock worker's lung.  Indium lung  Indium lung is an interstitial lung disease caused by occupational exposure to indium tin oxide. Nanoparticles The high surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles may make them an inhalation hazard for workers exposed to them. This is a topic of ongoing research as of 2015. Nickel Nickel is classified by the IARC as a Group 1 carcinogen; nickel compound exposure is associated with nasal cancer as well as lung cancer. Workers may be exposed to nickel in machining/grinding industry, nickel extraction/production, welding, and electroplating. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), fused-ring chemicals formed during the combustion of fossil fuels, are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 complex to highly reactive carbocations, which can mutate DNA and cause cancer. Workers may be exposed to PAHs while working in a foundry, in the roofing industry, or due to environmental tobacco smoke. Silica Exposure to silica can cause Silicosis, which is a fibrosing interstitial lung disease caused by inhaling fine particles of silica, most commonly in the form of quartz or cristobalite. Short-term exposures of large amounts of silica or long-term (10 years or more) exposure of lower levels of silica can cause silicosis. In 1968, more than 1060 US workers died of silicosis; this number fell to 170 by 2005. Besides causing silicosis, inhalation of silica can cause or exacerbate COPD. It can also impair lung function in general and cause cancer by oxidation damage. It is classified as a \\"known human carcinogen\\" (Group 1 carcinogen) by the IARC. Exposure is common for people working in tunneling, quarrying, construction, sandblasting, roadway repair, mining, and foundry work. Silo-filler's disease Silo-filler's disease (not to be confused with farmer's lung associated with inhalation of biologic dusts) results from inhalation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas from fresh silage. The presentation is variable depending on level of exposure. Often the gas penetrates throughout the lung and if severe can manifest as a form of acute respiratory distress syndrome, such as significant pulmonary edema, hyalinized alveolar membranes, congestion and other respiratory illnesses. Tobacco smoke Tobacco smoke is a known carcinogen. Workers in the hospitality industry may be exposed to tobacco smoke in the workplace, especially in environments like casinos and bars/restaurants. Infectious exposure=Influenza Health care professionals are at risk of occupational influenza exposure; during a pandemic influenza, anyone in a close environment is at risk, including those in an office environment. Tuberculosis Tuberculosis is a lung disease endemic in many parts of the world. Health care professionals and prison guards are at high risk for occupational exposure to tuberculosis, since they work with populations with high rates of the disease.  Others = World Trade Center lung  World Trade Center lung is a cluster of diseases caused by exposure to fallout at Ground Zero of the September 11 attacks in 2001. These diseases include asthma, asthmatic bronchitis, terminal airways disease, sarcoidosis, and acute eosinophilic pneumonia.

He won two Super Bowls with the Giants before playing for the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions and New York Jets. After his playing career ended, Johnson began working as an assistant coach for the New England Patriots. In New England he was reunited with Bill Belichick, for whom Johnson played as a Giant and Brown. He spent 14 seasons with the organization, winning three Super Bowls, before leaving the Patriots to work as the defensive line coach for the Buffalo Bills and then the New York Jets. After a stint as the Memphis Express' defensive coordinator in 2019, he joined the XFL. He had a brief stint with the Los Angeles Wildcats as their defensive coordinator in 2020. Playing career=College Upon graduation from Detroit's Mackenzie High School, Johnson played college football for the Ohio State University Buckeyes under head coach Earle Bruce. Johnson lettered every year from 1982 to 1985, and led the team in tackles in 1984 and 1985. He was a team co-captain and named defensive MVP by his teammates in 1984 and 1985, and in 1985 was named as an All-American. Johnson ended his college career with 379 total tackles, 5 sacks, and 12 tackles for loss. He was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame in 2001. NFL Johnson was drafted by the New York Giants in the second round of the 1986 NFL Draft. With the Giants, he was a member of both the Super Bowl XXI and Super Bowl XXV-winning teams, under head coach Bill Parcells and assistant Bill Belichick. After seven seasons in New York, Johnson re-joined Belichick with the Cleveland Browns in 1993, Belichick's third season as the team's head coach. After the 1995 season, the Browns moved to Baltimore, Maryland, and neither Belichick nor Johnson followed the team there. Johnson instead joined the Detroit Lions, whom he spent one season with 1996. For what would become the final two seasons of his career, Johnson again re-joined Belichick, who was then serving as the defensive coordinator for the New York Jets under Parcells. After the 1998 season, Johnson retired from the NFL with career totals of 25.5 sacks, 12 forced fumbles, 14 interceptions, and had 983 tackles. Coaching career Johnson began his coaching career as an assistant linebackers coach with the Patriots during the 2000 season. Johnson then served as the Patriots' inside linebackers coach from 2001 through 2003, before moving to defensive line coach in 2004. In 2012, he returned to linebackers coach.https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/01/22/assistant- coach-pepper-johnson-leaving-patriots/VXSJxEQ4MyO5BSoGYoHgLM/story.html With Bill Gutman, Johnson wrote Won For All, an account of the Patriots 2001 championship season, which was published by Contemporary Books, a McGraw-Hill company, . On January 21, 2014, Johnson announced he would be leaving the Patriots. On January 31, 2014, the Buffalo Bills announced Johnson as their new defensive line coach, replacing Anthony Weaver, who left for a similar position in Cleveland. After Doug Marrone quit as the Bills head Coach, Johnson was hired as the Jets Defensive Line coach. He was fired after the 2016 season.https://deadspin.com/q-a-pepper-johnson-on-drinking-with-bill- belichick-sp-1828726414 On December 18, 2018, Johnson was hired as the defensive line coach for the Memphis Express of the Alliance of American Football. In that role, he worked under head coach Mike Singletary. After the league's midseason shutdown in 2019, he joined the Los Angeles Wildcats for the 2020 season as defensive coordinator and linebackers coach. However, he was fired days after the Wildcats lost the season opener to the Houston Roughnecks 37‚Äì17, a game that saw Los Angeles' defense allow four passing touchdowns. Personal life Johnson's nickname of \\"Pepper\\" originated from his aunt who noticed Johnson liked to put black pepper on his corn flakes. Pepper's son, Dionte Johnson (born June 28, 1986) is a former fullback for the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Arizona Cardinals. Dionte was elected as a captain of the Ohio State team in 2007, making Pepper and Dionte only the third father-son captains (after Jim and Kirk Herbstreit and James and Jeff Davidson) in Buckeye history. Pepper also has a daughter, Aanjeya Johnson, (born May 20, 2009) with his wife Shanna, a Realtor from Massachusetts.

Career Bayles handled synthesizer and electronics in Seattle-based indie rock band Minus the Bear from the band's inception. He left them in January 2006 to focus on his production work. Following his departure from Minus the Bear, he produced two of their albums, Planet of Ice and Infinity Overhead. Some of Bayles' early work includes producing, engineering, and mixing the seminal albums Oceanic by Isis and We Are the Romans by Botch. Later, he also produced and engineered Blood Mountain by Mastodon, which was one of the most critically acclaimed albums of 2006, ranking at 9th in Rolling Stone's Top 50 Albums of 2006. More recently, Bayles has worked with St. Louis indie rock band Foxing, handling the production and mixing of their 2015 LP, Dealer.

Purportedly, the original Iraqi name has been repurposed by U.S. personnel involved with the facility as a backronym standing for \\"Nasty Ass Military Area\\".  History  After the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, the camp was taken over by elite American special operations forces. The main purpose of the camp was to interrogate prisoners for information about Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The New York Times reported on 19 March 2006, the three-year anniversary of the U.S. invasion, that the elite unit, known as Task Force 6-26, used the facility to interrogate prisoners both before and after the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal. Some of the interrogation took place in \\"The Black Room,\\" which used to be a torture chamber when Saddam's government ran the facility. The camp was the target of repeated warnings and investigations from U.S. officials since August 2003. There were placards around the camp that read \\"No Blood No Foul,\\" a reference to the notion, described by a Pentagon official, that \\"If you don't make them bleed, they can't prosecute for it.\\" Allegations of abuse were first reported in the mainstream U.S. media in 2005.R. Jeffrey Smith and Josh White, \\"Soldier Who Reported Abuse Was Sent to Psychiatrist,\\" The Washington Post (5 March 2005) p. A15. After the more extensive New York Times report in 2006, which was \\"based on documents and interviews with more than a dozen people,\\" the independent organization Human Rights Watch issued a report documenting detainee abuse in Iraq. The report confirmed the charges about Camp Nama uncovered by The New York Times, noting that \\"from 2003 to the present, numerous U.S. personnel and Iraqi detainees have reported serious mistreatment of detainees by the special task force, including beatings, exposure to extreme cold, threats of death, humiliation, and various forms of heavy interrogation. Many of these allegations have been contained in documents released to the American Civil Liberties Union and other human rights groups pursuant to Freedom of Information Act litigation.\\"Human Rights Watch, \\"No Blood, No Foul\\": Soldiers' Accounts of Detainee Abuse in Iraq 18:3 (July 2006). The report included an extensive interview with one Sergeant, using the pseudonym \\"Jeff Perry\\", who worked as an interrogator with the task force running the detention center. Sergeant \\"Perry\\" indicated that written authorizations were required for most abusive techniques, indicating that the use of these tactics was approved up the chain of command: > There was an authorization template on a computer, a sheet that you would > print out, or actually just type it in. And it was a checklist. And it was > all already typed out for you, environmental controls, hot and cold, you > know, strobe lights, music, so forth. Working dogs, which, when I was there, > wasn‚Äôt being used. But you would just check what you want to use off, and if > you planned on using a harsh interrogation you‚Äôd just get it signed off. I > never saw a sheet that wasn‚Äôt signed. It would be signed off by the > commander, whoever that was, whether it was O3 [captain] or O6 [colonel], > whoever was in charge at the time. ... When the O6 was there, yeah, he would > sign off on that. ... He would sign off on that every time it was done. Some > interrogators would go and use these techniques without typing up one of > those things just because it was a hassle, or he didn‚Äôt want to do it and > knew it was going to be approved anyway, and you‚Äôre not gonna get in that > much trouble if you get caught doing one of these things without a > signature. Techniques involving outright assault‚Äîhitting, slapping, and > beating‚Äîwere apparently not on the list, but were regularly used at Nama, > indicating that the harsh methods that were approved often degenerated into > even harsher treatment in practice. Human Rights Watch's senior researcher on terrorism and counterterrorism commented, \\"These accounts rebut U.S. government claims that torture and abuse in Iraq was unauthorized and exceptional ‚Äì on the contrary, it was condoned and commonly used.\\"\\"U.S.: Soldiers Tell of Detainee Abuse in Iraq.\\" Human Rights Watch press release (23 July 2006).  Investigation and inter-agency conflict  The reports of abuses inside Camp Nama were said to have outraged even seasoned CIA, FBI and DIA investigators accustomed to dealing with non- cooperative and hostile detainees, and to have provoked a culture clash between agencies and groups involved with the facility. By early 2004, one of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's top aides, Under-Secretary for Defense Intelligence Stephen A. Cambone, ordered a subordinate, DIA head Vice Adm. Lowell E. Jacoby to \\"get to the bottom\\" of any misconduct. By June 25, 2004, Admiral Jacoby wrote a two-page memo to Cambone, in which he described a series of complaints, including a May 2004 incident in which a DIA interrogator said he witnessed task force soldiers punch a detainee hard enough to require medical help. The DIA officer took photos of the injuries, but a supervisor confiscated them, the memo said. The memo provoked an angry reaction from Mr. Cambone. \\"Get to the bottom of this immediately. This is not acceptable,\\" Mr. Cambone said in a handwritten note on June 26, 2004, to his top deputy, Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin. \\"In particular, I want to know if this is part of a pattern of behavior by TF 6-26.\\" According to The New York Times article, General Boykin had earlier said (on March 17) through a spokesman that he told Mr. Cambone he had found no pattern of misconduct with the task force. The article does not provide further detail on Boykin's response to the investigation after Cambone's and Jacoby's intervention in June, 2004.  Transfer to LSA Anaconda  According to The New York Times article, in the summer of 2004, Camp Nama closed and the unit moved to \\"a new headquarters in Balad, 45 miles north of Baghdad.\\" This would probably refer to Balad AB, also known as Logistics Support Area Anaconda and later as Joint Base Balad. Since the transfer the unit's operations are said to have been shrouded in even tighter secrecy. According to Thomas E. Ricks of The Washington Post, a new \\"detainee center\\" has indeed been established at Camp Balad, under the auspices of a new unit, the Joint Special Operations Task Force; entry is not permitted to normal Army Rangers personnel.  Prisoner abuse  British soldiers testified that: * Iraqi prisoners being held for prolonged periods in cells the size of large dog kennels. * Prisoners being subjected to electric shocks. * Prisoners being routinely hooded. * Inmates being taken into a sound-proofed shipping container for interrogation, and emerging in a state of physical distress.  Special areas = The Black Room  Detainees at the camp that were considered \\"high-value\\" were interrogated in \\"The Black Room,\\" a dark mostly bare room with large metal hooks hanging from the ceiling. The guards often used loud rock 'n' roll or rap music to torment prisoners during interrogations.  Motel 6 and Hotel California  The New York Times mentions other whimsically named sections of Camp Nama, including Motel 6, \\"a group of securely constructed wooden holding cells constructed by the United States Navy Seabees of Charlie Company NMCB-1 Air-Det. Conditions were cramped, forcing many prisoners to squat or crouch\\", in a block of 6-by-8 cubicles known as Hotel California. These holding cells were constructed to hold the leaders and Individuals responsible for terrorist acts and murders.

It begins just south of the village of Unionville at the New Jersey state line in the town of Minisink, where it connects to that state's Route 284\\\\. From Unionville, the route heads through rural parts of Orange County for just over to an intersection with U.S. Route 6 (US 6) in the hamlet of Slate Hill, located southwest of the city of Middletown in the town of Wawayanda. The highway has been part of a state route since 1924 when it became part of New York State Route 8, a road continuing northeast through Middletown and Montgomery to Newburgh. NY 8 was split into two routes as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, with the portion of the highway south of Montgomery becoming New York State Route 84\\\\. When Interstate 84 (I-84) was built along a similar alignment to NY 84 in the mid-1960s, the state route was renumbered again in May 1966 to prevent confusion between the two roads. The section of NY 84 south of Slate Hill was redesignated as NY 284 while the rest of the highway was absorbed by other, pre-existing routes. Route description NY 284 northbound past its southern terminus at Route 284 at the New Jersey border in Minisink NY 284 begins at the New Jersey state line in the town of Minisink as a northerly continuation of that state's Route 284\\\\. The route heads northwest for a short distance into the village of Unionville, where it serves as the main thoroughfare through the community. In the center of the village, the highway reaches an intersection with County Route 36 (CR 36, named Main Street), which heads west to the New Jersey state line and becomes CR 651 upon entering Sussex County. NY 284 turns north at this junction, passing a handful of homes before bending to the northwest and leaving the village limits for less developed areas of Minisink. Outside of Unionville, the route slowly bends to the northeast, paralleling the former right-of-way of the Middletown and New Jersey Railroad (MNJ) as it runs northwest through farmlands. At the far eastern end of the hamlet of Waterloo Mills, the highway also begins to follow Rutgers Creek. The waterway, the former railroad right-of-way and the road take similar paths to the hamlet of Westtown, where NY 284 serves as the main north-south route through the community. It passes Lockenhurst Pond in the southern part of the hamlet before meeting CR 1 near Art Fords Lake. Past Westtown, NY 284 winds its way northeastward across another rural part of Minisink, intersecting CR 62 and CR 22 at back-to-back junctions near the northern town line. The latter route provides access to the hamlet of Johnson, which NY 284 bypasses to the southeast. North of CR 22, Rutgers Creek merges with Indigot Creek, a small stream forming part of the Minisink‚ÄìWawayanda town line. The combined stream continues to serve as the boundary between the two towns as Rutgers Creek takes on a southeasterly course from this point. NY 284 crosses over the waterway, entering Wawayanda and connecting to CR 93 (Lime Kiln Road) just north of the town line. From CR 93, the highway runs northeastward across open, rolling terrain, following an active part of the MNJ Railroad to the hamlet of Slate Hill. NY 284 ends in the center of the community at a junction with US 6. History Modern NY 284 was gradually acquired by the state of New York over the course of the early 20th century. The first stretch to be added to the state highway system was the section between the northern village line of Unionville and the hamlet of Slate Hill, which was improved by the state under a contract awarded on June 18, 1904. Work to bring the existing highway up to state highway standards cost $50,879 (equivalent to $ in ), and the rebuilt road was taken over by the state on December 19, 1906. It was designated but not signed as State Highway 160 (SH 160). A contract to improve the highway's continuation to the New Jersey state line south of Unionville was awarded on June 19, 1922, and the highway was reconstructed and taken over by the state by 1926 as SH 500. NY 284 in Slate Hill, approaching the junction with US 6 When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, SH 160 and SH 500 became the westernmost portion of NY 8, which continued northeast to Newburgh by way of Middletown and Montgomery. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the NY 8 designation was reassigned to another highway serving the Central New York Region and the North Country. The portion of its former alignment east of Montgomery became part of the new NY 215 while the rest was renumbered to NY 84.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering Another, much smaller renumbering was carried out in May 1966 after I-84 was built along an alignment similar to that of NY 84\\\\. To prevent confusion between the two nearby roads, the section of NY 84 south of Slate Hill was renumbered to NY 284 while the part east of Middletown became an extension of NY 211\\\\. From Slate Hill to Middletown, the road remained part of US 6 and NY 17M, which NY 84 had previously overlapped.

Their preferred autonym is Mayangna, as the name \\"Sumo\\" is a derogatory name historically used by the Miskito people. Their culture is closer to that of the indigenous peoples of Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia than to the Mesoamerican cultures to the north. The Mayangna inhabited much of the Mosquito Coast in the 16th century. Since then, they have become more marginalized following the emergence of the Miskito as a regional power. Distribution The Mayangna Indians, today divided into the Panamahka, Twahka and Ulwa ethno-linguistic subgroups, live primarily in remote settlements on the rivers Coco, Waspuk, Pispis and Bocay in north-eastern Nicaragua, as well as on the Patuca across the border in Honduras and far to the south along the R√≠o Grande de Matagalpa. The isolation of these communities has allowed the Mayagna to preserve their language and culture away from the assimilatory impulses of both the larger Miskitu Indian group, who live closer to the Atlantic coastline, and the ‚ÄòSpaniards‚Äô (as the Mayangna still refer to the Spanish-speaking Mestizos who form the ethnic majority population of Nicaragua), who are for the most part confined to the larger towns in the region that the Mayangna inhabit.G. von Houwald and J. Jenkins Molieri, ‚ÄòDistribuci√≥n y vivienda sumu en Nicaragua,‚Äô Encuentro, Revista de la Universidad Centroamericana (1975) History=Early history The evidence provided by an analysis of the Misumalpan language family, to which the Mayangna languages belong and which also includes Miskitu and the extinct Matagalpan and Cacaopera tongues once spoken in the Nicaraguan highlands and southern El Salvador, indicates the continuous presence of these groups in the region from around 2000BC.B. Pineda, 'Miskitu and Misumalpan Languages', in Encyclopaedia of Linguistics Vol.II, p.1 In fact, until the migration from southern Mexico of tribes speaking Oto-Manguean languages who arrived on the Pacific Coast of Nicaragua in the ninth century AD and the Nahua groups from even further north that followed, Misumalpan languages were probably spoken across the whole of Nicaragua. In the seventeenth century the British, rather than the Spaniards, established a presence in the eastern regions of what are now Nicaragua and Honduras. When they arrived on the Caribbean coast in the 1630s, it appears that the Mayangna were divided into at least nine different sub-tribes, whose territories stretched from the southern Atlantic Coast far into the interior of Nicaragua, as evidenced by the preponderance of Mayangna-language place-names that survive across this region.R. Dolores Green, Las viejas historias de los Sumus (CIDCA, undated) p.16-17 But it was a different indigenous group who profited from friendly contact with the new European arrivals. Sometimes posited as a coastal- dwelling Mayangna sub-tribe,Conzemius, Survey, p.14 but given their distinctive language more likely to have been a related Misumalpan group,M. Helms, ‚ÄòThe Cultural Ecology of a Colonial Tribe,‚Äô Ethnology, Vol. 8, No. 1 (Jan., 1969), p.6 the Miskitu, who appear to have originally lived on the northern Atlantic Coast around Cabo Gracias a Dios, are an interesting example of people who grew through culture-contact on the Coast, and whose ethnic identity and even racial composition is intimately intertwined with their position as intermediaries in the relations between the Europeans and the other Indians living in the region, who also included the Pech and the now much reduced but previously widespread Rama in the far south. The Miskitu Kingdom The Miskitu acquired firearms as a result of their lucrative trading arrangements with the Europeans, and through their position as allies of the British in their prolonged conflict with the Spanish. The Mayangna tribes and the Miskitu had always raided as well as traded with one another,Carey, p.4 but the new weapons tipped the local balance of power firmly in the direction of the latter. Miskitu raids into the interior carried away increasing numbers of (primarily Mayangna) captives, of whom the women were kept and the men sold on to the British to work the growing Jamaican plantations. Augmented by this new influx of women into their communities, as well as by the absorption of escaped or ship-wrecked African slaves, the Miskitu population boomed and this formerly small tribe soon emerged as the politically and demographically dominant local power, a fact already acknowledged by the British in 1660 when they crowned a chieftain called Oldman as the ‚ÄòMiskitu King,‚Äô recognising him and his descendants as the legitimate authorities on the coast.P. Dennis and M. Olien, ‚ÄòKingship among the Miskito,‚Äô American Ethnologist, (Nov. 1984), p.2 In the eighteenth century the Spanish managed to penetrate the central Nicaraguan highlands, where they converted and permanently settled many of the native Matagalpa Indians. However, these attempts were made difficult by the resistance of the neighbouring Mayangna groups who constantly raided the new communities, sometimes in conjunction with Miskitu war parties.J. Gould, To Die In This Way: Nicaraguan Indians and the Myth of Mestizaje, 1880‚Äì1965 (Durham, 1998) p.31, p.76 In the same period, the Mayangna themselves also increasingly succumbed to the better-armed Miskitu raiders, and began a steady retreat into the interior, towards the headwaters of the rivers along which most of the groups had originally lived. Contrary to the assumptions of some scholars,G. von Houwald, Mayangna, (Colecci√≥n Cultural de Centro Am√©rica (Managua, 2006), p.215 this did not mean that the Mayangna totally cut themselves off from the outside world, and while those who remained in coastal areas were often forced to pay tribute to the Miskitu King, even the more isolated Mayangna communities formed an integral part of regional trading networks, and through their access to the highest quality tropical hardwoods controlled the production and sale of the canoes that -ironically - were used against them by the Miskitu in their slaving expeditions.M, Olien, ‚ÄòAfter the Indian Slave Trade: Cross-Cultural Trade in the Western Caribbean Rimland, 1816-1820,‚Äô Journal of Anthropological Research, Vol. 44, No. 1 (Spring, 1988), p.5 Early twentieth century The Mayangna population continued to decline after the British gave up their claim to the Mosquito Coast in 1860, due to the combined effects of disease,Conzemius, Survey, p.121-122 internecine warfare, and assimilationist pressures from both Miskitu and the new Nicaraguan state.

Green, A Lexicographic Study of Ulwa (PhD Thesis: MIT, 1989) p.13 by 1862 only around 5-6000 remained.Conzemius p.14 The final blow for the Mayangna came at the beginning of the twentieth century with their conversion to Christianity, a task undertaken by missionaries from the Moravian Church, who arrived in the region from Germany in 1847 but only began to make a real impact on the native population after the departure of the British. During the so-called ‚ÄòGreat Awakening‚Äô of the 1880s much of the Miskitu population converted to the new faith en masse, and buoyed by this success the Moravians increasingly turned their attention to the Mayangna. Just as the Catholic missionaries of the colonial era had done throughout the Spanish Empire, this first involved persuading the Mayangna, who up to this point had lived in dispersed family groupings and had continued to observe a traditional and often semi-nomadic lifestyle based on hunting, fishing and a shifting agriculture, to come together and settle permanently in new, compact and accessible communities, centred around a church. This disruption of their old lifestyle had a negative effect on the Mayangnas‚Äô attachment to many aspects of their traditional culture, while the proximity of the new settlements to Miskitu communities, and the missionaries‚Äô policy of preaching the Gospel and teaching literacy only in the Miskitu language brought the Mayangna into increased contact with both the Miskitu themselves and with Miskitu culture in general. This increased the tendency of Mayangna individuals to try to shed their original identity either by marrying out of the group or by abandoning their original language in order to move higher within the Coastal ethnic hierarchy, in which the Miskito had a higher position, and by the mid-twentieth century many of the new communities founded by Mayangna converts, such as Quamwatla, Prinzubila and Bikbila, regarded themselves as wholly Miskitu.G. von Houwald and J. Jenkins Molieri, ‚ÄòDistribuci√≥n y vivienda sumu en Nicaragua,‚Äô Encuentro, Revista de la Universidad Centroamericana (1975), pp.78-80 Meanwhile, for those who still regarded themselves as Mayangna, the new religion became a key part of their identity, and the Moravian Church replaced the old hold of the chieftains and sukias (traditional healers) on Mayangna life. The arrival in the region of rebel general Augusto Sandino's guerrilla forces in the 1920s caused even the most remote Mayangna communities to become embroiled in the conflict, and Mayangna men appear to have been in high demand from both Sandino‚Äôs men and the Marines as guides and boatmen, and even as fighters: a description of the Sandinista raiders who blew up the La Luz mine in 1928 notes that ‚Äúamong their number were several Sumu Indians armed with shotguns and machetes.‚ÄùLetter from the American Consul to the American Legation, Managua, 17/05/1928 () But the biggest threat to the Mayangna in the first half of the twentieth century was the loss of lands to mestizo settlers from Western Nicaragua, and destruction and ‚Äòtheft‚Äô of Mayangna natural resources. The rising price of copper meant the opening of a new mine at Rosita in 1959, which by 1970 had generated 40-50 million dollars for its American owners.CIERA, Breve historia, p.6 But the discharge of toxic waste products into the local rivers devastated the ecosystems that the Mayangna communities traditionally depended on for their food supply. In Wasakin, only a few miles downriver from Rosita, these also caused ‚Äústomach pains, vomiting, vomiting blood, fevers, headaches and coughing‚Äù in those who bathed in or drank the water, eventually resulting in the deaths of up to three children a day in January and February 1979.R. Dolores Green, p.21 Revolution and civil war The Nicaraguan Revolution heralded sudden and dramatic change on the Atlantic Coast, which had long been an internal colony of Somoza‚Äôs Pacific-oriented Nicaraguan state, which exploited the region‚Äôs resources but otherwise neglected it. Proclaiming as one of their primary targets the ‚Äòintegration‚Äô of the Atlantic Coast, the Sandinistas dramatically increased the presence of the State in the most remote corners of the region. Early Mayangna experiences of the Revolution were largely positive, as new roads and clinics were built and the Sandinista-led 'Literacy Crusade', which eventually included teaching in local native languages, led to many Mayangna learning to read and write ‚Äì 1,449 according to a government reportINNICA, Logros y problemas del gobierno revolucionario en Zelaya Norte, (Managua, 1981), p.3 ‚Äì and the birth of Mayangna itself as a written language. However, after fighting broke out between the Sandinista state and Miskitu Indians, some Mayangna, under pressure from two seemingly neutral institutions dominated by the Miskitu - the Moravian ChurchS. Hawley, ‚ÄòProtestantism and Indigenous Mobilisation,‚Äô Journal of Latin American Studies, Vol. 29, No.1 (Feb. 1997), p.14 and MISURASATA, both of which had come to play an important part in Mayangna cultural and political life - joined the Miskitu guerrilla forces, prompting the Sandinistas to arrest Mayangna leaders and occupy various Mayangna communities. More than 3000 MayangnaCIDCA, Situcaci√≥n de los desplazados de guerra ‚Äì Mina Rosita, CIDCA (Nov., 1985) \\\\- around half of the total Mayangna population - subsequently fled to squalid refugee camps in Honduras, where many were then drafted (often forcibly) into MISURA, the main Miskitu guerrilla force. Many of those remaining in Nicaragua were then moved by the Sandinista government from their homes - now in the midst of a war zone - to equally unsanitary camps in the interior of the country. Perceived mistreatment by both the Miskitu leadership and lower-ranking Miskitu ‚Äòcomrades‚Äô generated serious discontent amongst the Mayangna guerrillas, and in 1983, the most important Mayangna rebel commander, Ampinio Palacios, decided to leave MISURA with his men and go over to the FDN with around two- hundred other Mayangna troops. Most other Mayangna guerrillas deserted soon after, but they faced serious threats from MISURA which, angered and worried by the desertions, tried to forcibly recruit the reluctant Mayangna back into its ranks.Americas Watch Committee, The Sumus in Nicaragua and Honduras: An Endangered People (New York and Washington, D.C.: Americas Watch, 1987) For the Mayangna, an escape from the conflict was only possible after a genuine shift occurred in the Sandinistas‚Äô own nationalist ideology, which moved beyond a purely rhetorical acceptance of the ‚Äòdifferences‚Äô on the Coast towards a practical commitment to embrace them as part of the process of constructing a new society. After President Daniel Ortega announced in December 1984 that the Sandinistas would recognise the Atlantic Coast‚Äôs right to autonomy, the Mayangna ethnic organisation SUKALWALA began direct negotiations with Tom√°s Borge, the head of the Northern Zelaya Autonomy Commission, and won the exemption of the Mayangna from the draft. Soon after, in April 1985, the recently elected Assemblea Nacional passed an amnesty decree, proposed by Mayangna leader Ronas Dolores Green amongst others, which specifically covered 'miskitos, sumos, ramas y creoles.''Aprobado amnest√≠a para miskitos, sumos y ramas,‚Äô \\"Barricada\\", 30/04/1985 This helped to restore Mayangna trust in the Sandinistas, and paved the way for the return to Nicaragua of the Mayangna refugees and ex-combatants in Honduras, harassed there as they were by the Miskitu.Nathaniel Morris, 'Between Two Fires: Mayangna Indians in Post-Revolutionary Nicaragua, 1979‚Äì1990', in Bulletin of Latin American Research, Vol. 33, Issue 2, p.215 Autonomy In the Mayangna language, ‚Äòautonomy‚Äô translates as ‚Äúalas yalahnin lani‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äòto live our system of life.‚Äù However, the current autonomous political system falls far short of this ideal in the eyes of the Mayanga, who feel that despite countless sacrifices they are still caught between two fires; with the advancing ‚Äòagricultural frontier‚Äô of mestizo peasants, who invade their communal lands and despoil their forests, on the one side, and on the other, once again, the Miskitu leaders, who ignore their distinct problems as a people and yet still portray themselves as representatives of all of the ‚ÄòIndians‚Äô of the Coast, depriving the Mayangna of the chance to ever make themselves heard. The Mayangna look to the Sandinista-run central government as their only ally, and hope that the gradual progress of territorial demarcation and the titling of lands that has taken place under the Ortega government will eventually usher in a real autonomy for the Mayangna. In 2001 the Mayagna of the small community of Awas Tingni (then 1100 people) won an important ruling from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, established in 1979 by agreement among the signatories of the Organization of American States (OAS). The ruling established that indigenous peoples had rights to the land where they had traditionally lived and had tenure. However, problems with the land continue, and in Wasakin (a Mayangna community near Rosita) a state of violent confrontation between the Mayangna and invading Mestizos has led to the killing of a rancher and the subsequent murder of two young Indians. Mayangna language The indigenous groups previously known collectively as the 'Sumu' have never spoken a single, unified language. The language spoken around Rosita and Bonanza in the north-eastern part of the RAAN, and today known as 'Mayangna', is in fact two closely related dialects, Twahka and Panamahka, while the people of Karawala in the RAAS, who were also formerly regarded as 'Sumu', speak a closely related sister-language called Ulwa. Both languages belong to the Misumalpan language family. Today, most people speak Mayangna at home but can also speak Miskito in order to interact with the communities around them, and the existence of the Ulwa language is regarded as increasingly threatened by this shift to Miskito.

Earlier he was Chief of Staff/1st Deputy Commander of the Baltic Fleet, Chief of Staff/1st Deputy Commander of the Pacific Fleet since 1993 and Chief of the Main Staff/1st Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. Kuroyedov graduated from the Pacific S.O. Makarov Higher Naval School, the N. G. Kuznetsov Naval Academy and the General Staff Academy. Kuroyedov joined the navy in 1962, graduating from the S.O. Makarov Pacific Higher Naval School in 1967. He served aboard frigates in the Pacific Fleet. In 1976‚Äì78 he studied at the Grechko (now Kuznetsov) Naval Academy graduating with distinction. From 1979 to 1987 he served in the Pacific Fleet commanding a division of minesweepers and was Chief of Staff of the Sakhalin Flotilla. From 1987 to 1989 he studied at the Voroshilov General Staff Academy graduating with the gold medal and was promoted to rear admiral. In 1993 he became Chief of Staff of the Baltic Fleet and became Commander of the Pacific Fleet in 1994. He became Chief of the Main Navy Staff in 1997 and was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy in November 1997. Kuroyedov was promoted to Fleet Admiral in February 2000. Kuroyedov tendered his resignation in the wake of the Kursk submarine disaster but his resignation was refused. He was retired one day before his 61st birthday in 2005, mandatory retirement age for Russian senior officers being 60 (though the President can extend their service tenure in one year increments until 64). Conflicting views on Kuroyedov's retirement speculate either that he was fired because he had presided over too many naval embarrassments, including the sinking of Kursk or because the President wished to emphasize the need for greater discipline in the Navy.

They won the 2003 MTV Europe Music Award for the Best Portuguese Act. History Blind Zero started out 1994 releasing their first EP, Recognize (1995), which sold out in nine days, and is today a collection item. The first album Trigger (1995), was produced by Ronnie S. Champagne (an L.A. producer who had previously worked with bands such as Jane's Addiction, Alice in Chains, Remy Zero and Deconstruction). It was the first rock album by a Portuguese band to reach the gold label. In 1996, Blind Zero revealed a new sound with the Flexogravity EP, a very experimental record with a fusion of sounds, shared with a hip-hop band from Porto, Mind da Gap. This was considered by many the EP of the year. Also in 1996, the band recorded an acoustic album, Transradio, one of the first Enhanced CDs (CD Extra) in Europe. The album was recorded live at Antena 3 radio. Months later they were invited to participate in SCYPE (Song Contest for Youth Programs in Europe), a festival gathering bands from all over Europe. They recorded a new original song, \\"My House\\", and won the contest. In 1997, Blind Zero recorded Redcoast, the second album of originals produced by Michael Vail Blum (an American producer who had worked with Suicidal Tendencies, Madonna, Roxy Music, 3T, Tura Satana, Goo Goo Dolls, and Jewel). Redcoast was produced at Sony Music/New York studios by Grammy Award winner Mark Wilder. In 1998, they recorded with M√°rio Caldato the song \\"The Wire\\", and spent 1999 working on their third album, One Silent Accident, which was released in 2000 and produced by Don Fleming (Sonic Youth, Hole, Posies, Screaming Trees, Teenage Fan Club, Gumball, and Alice Cooper). In 2002, they recorded one of the most famous songs by David Bowie, \\"Heroes\\". In January 2003, they started recording A Way to Bleed your Lover, produced by M√°rio Barreiros (Cl√£, Ornatos Violeta, Pedro Abrunhosa), adding a new member to the band, Miguel Ferreira. The album also contained contributions by Jorge Palma and Dana Colley (Twinmen/ex-Morphine). In May 2003, Blind Zero were invited by MTV to perform live in Milan, as part of the initiative of launching MTV Portugal. Later that year they won the \\"Best Portuguese Act\\" award at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2003 in Edinburgh, becoming the first Portuguese band to receive an award by MTV. In December, the specialized press considered A Way to Bleed your Lover the best album of the year in Portugal. In 2005 they released The night before and a new day with Pedro Vidal (ex-Stealing Orchestra) as a member, replacing Marco Nunes on solo guitar. In 2007 they released Time Machine (memories undone), a best of Blind Zero unplugged album, associated with their 13th anniversary. In 2010, the album Luna Park was released on 30 May. Three singles were released from it, \\"Slow Time Love\\", \\"Snow Girl\\" and \\"The Tallest Building On Earth\\". In 2013, Kill Drama was released. Its first single was \\"I See Desire\\", which reflects the desire of young Portuguese people to work in foreign countries due to Portugal's economic situation. The album also included the singles \\"From You\\", \\"High and Low\\", and \\"I Will Take You Home\\". To celebrate Blind Zero's 20 years of existence they released Kill Drama II.

At the University of Waterloo's fall 2008 convocation, he was named Distinguished Professor Emeritus, an honor seldom bestowed on retired faculty. Early life and education Born on 10 August 1942 in Morris, Manitoba, Reimer was born and raised in Altona, Manitoba. As a teen, he was baptized in the local Mennonite church.A. James Reimer, The dogmatic imagination. The dynamics of Christian belief (Waterloo, ON; Scottdale, PA: Herald Press, 2003), 1. He held undergraduate degrees from Canadian Mennonite Bible College (1963; now Canadian Mennonite University) and the University of Manitoba (1971); he also spent a year studying at Union Theological Seminary in New York City (1971‚Äì72) before moving to the University of Toronto, where he earned an MA in history (1974) and a PhD in theology (1983), the latter degree conferred by the University of St. Michael's College, a college of the University of Toronto. His doctoral dissertation, directed by Gregory Baum, was a comparative and contrasting study of the political ramifications of theology in the respective thinking of Emanuel Hirsch and Paul Tillich. Theology Reimer's own theology was not typically Mennonite (vis-√†-vis John Howard Yoder),Cf. Reimer, \\"Mennonites, Christ and Culture: The Yoder Legacy ,\\" The Conrad Grebel Review 16, no. 2 (Spring 1998): 5-14; also Reimer, \\"Anabaptist, Mennonites and Paul Tillich: Can the Prophetic Spirit be Institutionalized?, in Br√ºcken der Vers√∂hnung: Festschrift f√ºr Gert Hummel zum 70. Geburtstag 2003, ed. P. Haigis, D. Lax(M√ºnster: LIT Verlag, 2003), 150-165. in that his point of departure was not the Sermon on the Mount but the classical imagination of trinitarian orthodoxy.Reimer, \\"Trinitarian Orthodoxy, Constantinianism, and Theology from a Radical Protestant Perspective,\\" in Faith to Creed: Ecumenical Perspectives on the Affirmation of the Apostolic Faith in the Fourth Century, ed.

Though he was deeply concerned with Christian social ethics, he insisted that ethics must have a ground external to itself. The triune God, for Reimer, constituted such ground.Cf. Reimer, \\"God (Trinity), Doctrine of.\\", in Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online (retrieved 13 September 2010); A Postliberal Metaphysics for Christian Ethics: The 1925 Dogmatics of Karl Barth and Paul Tillich, in √âtudes sur la Dogmatique, 1925, de Paul Tillich, ed.

Dogmatic foundations for Christian ethics (Kitchener, ON: Pandora Press [1999] 2001), 486-492. Whereas Mennonites have been historically critical of the dominant culture, Reimer's later work sought to develop a positive understanding of culture, law, public life and civil institutions.For example, see Reimer, Pacifism, Policing, and Individual Conscience , Conrad Grebel Review 26, no. 2 (Fall 2008): 129-141; \\"Constantine: From Religious Pluralism to Christian Hegemony,\\" in The Future of Religion: Toward a Reconciled Society, ed. Michael R. Ott (Leiden: Brill, 2007), 71-90. While writing his doctoral dissertation, Reimer became deeply troubled and conflicted about the theology of Emanuel Hirsch, a German Christian nationalist and Nazi sympathizer. Fearing that he was being swayed by Hirsch's arguments, Reimer sought to offset Hirsch's influence by aligning himself more concretely with left of centre politics. He joined the New Democratic Party and was an active party member for several years before finally resigning his membership over certain of the party's socio-ethical positions, particularly a woman's right to choose. Today, Reimer's overall political vision remains left of centre. Though he is a pacifist, he has argued that God's activity in the world cannot be reduced to any one ethical ideology; otherwise transcendence becomes domesticated. Reimer was quite productive as an academic. He published numerous articles in various journals; select articles have been compiled to form the content of two of his books: Mennonites and Classical Theology,A. James Reimer, Mennonites and classical theology. Dogmatic foundations for Christian ethics (Kitchener, ON: Pandora Press, 2001). and Paul Tillich: Theologian of Nature, Culture and Politics.A.

Opened in 1988, the center is located along Jamboree Road, just northeast of Interstate 5. Anchor tenants include Best Buy, Barnes & Noble, Dick's Sporting Goods, T.J. Maxx, The Home Depot, Target, and Edwards Theaters. The property is owned and managed by The Irvine Company. Design The Market Place covers an area of and has more than 120 stores, restaurants, cafes and theaters. Designed by Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta, it consists of monumental but extremely simplified cubic forms, with anchor stores marked by massive towers roughly high displaying the store name. The center is also unique in that all the store signs are displayed in neon. The overall design operates on the idea that center's tenants add most of the color and character to the otherwise plain center, a concept that had previously (though unsuccessfully) been attempted with Britain's Tricorn Centre. The buildings are arranged in a ring around a large central series of parking lots and fast-food restaurants. The center on the whole has a \\"desert\\" look to it, with parking lots shaded under groves of date palms, and extensive rock landscaping around the perimeter of the center. The parking lots are illuminated by arrays of xenon floodlights set inside the peaks of high towers. The buildings themselves are uniformly surfaced in bright orange, purple, and pink stucco. History=Phase 1 Construction of Phase I began in 1988 on the Tustin (northwest) side of Jamboree Road, and this phase was opened in three distinct sections. The first section opened in 1988, with of space allotted for home improvement and furnishings/decor retail stores. The second section of Phase I opened in 1989, with of soft goods, apparel and electronics stores. The third and final section of Phase I opened in 1990, with of restaurants, services and a six- screen Edwards Theater. Phase 2 In 1996, Phase II of the Tustin Market Place opened on the Irvine (southeast) side of Jamboree Road. This phase expanded the Market Place by , adding stores, restaurants and a 10-screen Edwards Stadium Theater. Phase 3 With the initiation of Construction of Phase III, also on the Irvine (South East) side of Jamboree Road, opening in 1999. Another of retail space were added to the Market Place in this phase, which included home improvement and furnishings stores, a large food court, and a Target store. Phase 4 In Spring 2014, three new restaurants were added in close proximity to the existing Best Buy store. A Chase Bank branch and a Food Court were also added close to the existing Lowe's store.  Phase 5  The Market Place added a Starbucks, with a drive through, and an Urban Plates restaurant near the Lowe's garden section in late 2015. A new building was added close to the theater to accommodate the two new restaurants.

Born in Germany's Rhineland in 1835, he immigrated to America in 1850, and arrived in Denver as one of the Pikes Peakers in 1861. He soon went to serve in the American Civil War and returned.Colorado Transcript, April 18, 1918. In 1873, he teamed with fellow German immigrant Adolph Coors, investing $18,000 to Coors $2000, to start the Golden Brewery, now known as Coors Brewery, at Golden, Colorado. He continued to operate his other businesses, including a successful bakery and bottling plant in Denver. In 1880 Coors had made enough money to repay his partner's interest, and Schueler sold out to him. In 1889, Schueler went into business with Morris Stackder in Aspen, building the Schueler-Stackder Concentrating mill. In later years Schueler became famous for Rocky Mountain spring water in his own right, running the Ute Chief Mineral Springs bottling works at Manitou Springs, Colorado by the early 20th Century.Colorado Transcript, 1904. After a great fire that burnt the bottling plant, the business was never the same. Later life and death Jacob Schueler died in Colorado Springs in 1918, and is buried at Denver's Riverside Cemetery. Bill Schueler died in the family home at Manitou Springs in 1958. Fred G Schueler (the youngest) son died in August 1960, also in Manitou Springs. Most of the Schueler family was laid to rest in a Denver cemetery, however Fred is buried with his wife Else (Wright) Schueler in Colorado Springs. The family's only survivor David Haskin now lives in Denver and is the director of Rampart search and rescue in Adams County.

Location and Geography Rubiataba is located in the north of the state, south of the source of the Crix√°s River. It is ~220 kilometres to the state capital of Goi√¢nia. Other distances are: *Nova Am√©rica: 21 km. to the north *Morro Agudo de Goi√°s: 41 km. to the southwest *Carmo do Rio Verde: 28 km. to the south *Nova Gloria: 24 km. to the east Neighboring municipalities are: *north: Nova Am√©rica and Itapuranga *south: Morro Agudo de Goi√°s and S√£o Patr√≠cio *east: Ceres *west: Araguapaz *Access from Goi√¢nia: GO-080 / Ner√≥polis / S√£o Francisco de Goi√°s / BR-153 / Jaragu√° / Rian√°polis / Rialma / GO-434 / Nova Gl√≥ria. See Seplan for all the distances. It is a municipality that was planned by the government and is one of the few settlements in the state that was already declared a city in the beginning of its existence. A curious fact is that the streets of the town have names of fruit trees. The climate is mild with an average temperature of 25 ¬∞C. The most important rivers are the S√£o Patr√≠cio and the Rio Novo. The municipality included the municipal seat together with the district of Waldel√¢ndia, the \\"povoado\\" of Cruzeiro, and the \\"aglomerados\\" of Bragol√¢ndia, Goiataba and Santa Luzia The Economy Cattle raising is important with a big production of milk and dairy products. There were 768 farms in 2006 with a total area of 49,428 hectares. Pasture land occupied 36,000 hectares. The size of the cattle herd was 75,000 in 2007. There are plantations of rice, beans, manioc, sugarcane (6,800 ha. and a production of 476,000 tons in 2007), and corn. There are several brickworks and lumber mills. The number of small furniture factories give the town the name \\"furniture capital\\" of the state. There is also a large distillery producing alcohol for fuel from the abundant sugarcane plantations. There were 03 bank branches in 2007: Banco do Brasil S.A., BRADESCO S.A., and Banco Ita√∫ S.A. History Rubiataba began in 1949 when the government of Get√∫lio Vargas decided to create an agricultural center in the region. The place had a good climate, with abundance of water and fertile soils. The first idea was to plant coffee. The name, \\"\\"Rubiataba\\" is a hybrid of \\"rubia\\", from rubiacea, and \\"taba\\", which means village. Seventy square kilometres were set aside for the future town, which was the first rural planned town in the country. It became a municipality in 1953. Health and Education In 2006 there were 26 schools and 2 hospitals with 57 beds. *Literacy rate in 2000: 86.7 *Infant mortality rate in 2000: 25.48 deaths for every 1,000 live births *Municipal Human Development Index: 0.748 *State ranking: 82 (out of 242 municipalities) *National ranking: 1,947 (out of 5,507 municipalities) See also *List of municipalities in Goi√°s *Microregions of Goi√°s References *Frigoletto * Sepin Category:Municipalities in Goi√°s ","title":"Rubiataba"},{"id":"4446933","text":"Jamake Highwater, born as Jackie Marks, and also known as Jay or J Marks (14 February 1931‚ÄìJune 3, 2001), was an American writer and journalist of eastern European Jewish ancestry,Alex Jacobs, \\"Fool‚Äôs Gold: The Story of Jamake Highwater, the Fake Indian Who Won‚Äôt Die\\", Indian Country Today, 19 June 2015 who from the late 1960s claimed to be of Cherokee and Native American ancestry. In that period, he published extensively under the name of Jamake Highwater. One version of his shifting story was that he had been adopted as a child and taken from his Indian home in Montana to grow up in a Greek or Armenian family in Los Angeles, Southern California. Highwater later lived in San Francisco, where he formed a dance company for a time, moving to New York City in the late 1960s. After this move, about 1969 Highwater assumed a false American Indian identity as Cherokee, using the name \\"Jamake Highwater\\" for his writings. He never said that he was enrolled in the tribe, but that he had \\"recovered\\" his Native identity. As Highwater, he wrote and published more than 30 fiction and non-fiction books of music, art, poetry and history. His children's novel Anpao: An American Indian Odyssey (1973) received a Newbery Honor. His book The Primal Mind: Vision and Reality in Indian America (1981) was the basis of a PBS film documentary about Native American culture, and he made other documentaries for PBS. His fabrications were exposed in 1984 by activist Hank Adams (Sioux-Assiniboine) and reporter Jack Anderson in separate publications. Highwater had already received more than $800,000 in grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting from 1982 to 1983, based on his claims to be Native American. Despite this documentation by Adams and Anderson, Highwater remained widely perceived as Native American. He continued to be called on to speak and participate as such in cultural activities, although he received no more federal grants on Native American topics. His claims about his year and place of birth, and the circumstances of his adoption, were reported as part of his obituaries in 2001 in mainstream press such as the New York Times and Los Angeles Times. Hank Adams wrote an Open Letter to the Editor in response, rejecting again Highwater's claims. Indian Country Today in 2015 reported additional findings about Highwater's elaborate pose. It published a copy of his 1931 birth certificate as Jackie Marks from Los Angeles and a photograph of his father's military gravestone, marked with a Star of David. Early life, education and career After Highwater died in 2001, researchers found his correct Social Security Number, leading them to his California birth certificate. This upended his misrepresentations about his parents, birthplace and birth day, and early life. He was born on 13 February 1931 in Los Angeles as Jackie Marks to parents Martha (Turetz) Marks, then 27, and Alexander Marks, then 49; they were born in Philadelphia and New York City, respectively. His parents were found by researchers to each have immigrant grandparents of Eastern European Jewish ancestry; his father's family had likely anglicized their name to Marks. His father's Jewish identification was affirmed by his family requesting a Star of David for his military gravestone. Alexander Marks was a veteran of World War I. Following a move to New York in 1969, Highwater claimed to have been adopted as an Indian child from Montana by a Greek-American family and raised in Los Angeles (another version said the family was Armenian). There was also a claim that the Marks family adopted him as a child.http://archives.nypl.org/mss/1395 In another version, he said his birth mother, whom he called Marcia Highwater, was of Blackfoot/French ancestry; in yet another version he said both his parents were Cherokee. He reportedly graduated from North Hollywood High School. He said he attended college in Los Angeles and gained a PhD degree by the age of 20; this was never documented. While living in San Francisco, Highwater started a small dance company, the San Francisco Contemporary Dancers, becoming the principal director and choreographer from 1954 to 1967, then moving to New York City in the late 1960s. He also started publishing professionally as J. Marks. He moved to New York City around 1969. At that time, he started using the name Jamake Highwater and claiming to be Cherokee and Native American. At various times he said his father was Eastern Cherokee and his mother Blackfoot and French. Native American intellectual Gerald Vizenor (Anishinaabe) described individuals such as Highwater, who took on identities as Native American, as \\"varionatives\\" in his 2000 book Fugitive Poses.Gerald Robert Vizenor, Fugitive Poses: Native American Indian Scenes of Absence and Presence, University of Nebraska Press, 2000, pp. 67-69 Highwater claimed not to know the year or place of his birth. A Los Angeles Times obituary gave a birthdate of February 14, 1942 in Montana as one possibility. Other sources claimed he was born as early as the 1920s. Career Highwater wrote more than 30 fiction and non-fiction books, including children's books, and works about music, art, poetry and history. His byline \\"Jamake Highwater\\" appeared on Anpao: An American Indian Odyssey (1973), a children's book; and The Sun, He Dies: A Novel About the End of the Aztec World (1980).Associated Press, \\"Jamake Highwater, American Indian Author\\", The New York Times, 16 June 2001 In 1981 Highwater published a non-fiction book, The Primal Mind: Vision and Reality in Indian America. By this time, he had made many connections in the media world. PBS adapted this book as the basis of a documentary about Native American culture, The Primal Mind (1984). Highwater served as the host of the documentary. He established the Primal Mind Foundation to support studies of Native American spirituality. Highwater \\"gained wide public exposure\\" through making several documentaries on Native American culture for PBS television, and serving as host. In the 1980s he was known nationally as a Native American figure. In 1993 Highwater was a consultant on the TV series Star Trek: Voyager for the character Chakotay. The character was broadly defined within the show as being Native American. Highwater also wrote for the New Grove Dictionary of American Music and the Los Angeles Free Press. False ancestry claims As noted, by the early 1960s, Highwater was using the name J. Marks when writing professionally. In 1969 he moved to New York City and started using the name Jamake Highwater, claiming he was of American Indian ancestry, particularly Cherokee. He gave conflicting accounts of his background. Highwater's false claims to American Indian ancestry were explored and documented by Hank Adams (Assiniboine) in a 1984 Akwesasne Notes article. He identified Highwater's inconsistencies about birthplace and date, parents, college, and other biographical details. Between 1982 and 1983 Highwater and his Primal Mind Foundation had received more than $825,000 dollars in federal grant money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) based on his identification as Native American. His claims of Native ancestry were strongly disputed by American Indian activists and intellectuals, who argued that his works were inauthentic and stereotypical. They said that he had illegally received the grant money by misrepresenting material facts about his life. Investigative journalist Jack Anderson followed up on Highwater in 1984, revealing the inconsistencies in the writer's biography and ultimately, his pose. His column, \\"A Fabricated Indian?\\", was published in The Washington Post. Following the expos√© by Anderson, Highwater stopped claiming Cherokee heritage in his promotional literature but he continued to take advantage of having become publicly established as an \\"Indian\\" figure. When questioned by Anderson about why he had assumed a Cherokee identity, Highwater said that he had thought he could not break into the writing world otherwise. Two years after Anderson's expose, Highwater published Shadow Show: An Autobiographical Insinuation (1986), in which he wrote: \\"the greatest mystery of my life is my own identity.\\" Vizenor commented on this that the \\"impostor\\" was an artist, and his \\"insinuations are clever simulations, but surely not a great mystery.\\" Highwater returned to the West Coast, living in Los Angeles in his later years. He died of a heart attack at home on June 3, 2001. Mainstream press such as the New York Times and Los Angeles Times carried obituaries that repeated his false claims about his alleged Native American past. Through his attorney, Highwater had blocked access to his papers for at least 50 years. In response to the mainstream obituaries, activist Hank Adams (Assiniboine) published an open letter in 2001 that detailed Highwater's many falsehoods: Honors and legacy *His children's novel Anpao: An American Indian Odyssey (1973) received a Newbery Honor. *His children's books received \\"a half-dozen Best Book for Young Adults awards from the American Library Association and School Library Journal.\\" *His book The Primal Mind: Vision and Reality in Indian America (1981) was the basis of a PBS documentary, The Primal Mind (1984). Representations in other media *According to Alex Jacobs, Gerald Vizenor (Anishinaabe) in his 1988 novel, The Trickster of Liberty, based his character Homer Yellow Snow on Jamake Highwater. Jacobs notes that Yellow Snow says to his Native audience: > If you knew who you were, why did you find it so easy to believe in me? ‚Ä¶ > because you want to be white, and no matter what you say in public, you > trust whites more than you trust Indians, which is to say, you trust pretend > Indians more than real ones.

Katedralen Hram Uspenie Bogorodichno) is the largest church building in Varna and the third largest cathedral in Bulgaria (after St. Alexander Nevski Cathedral in Sofia and St. Dimitar Cathedral in Vidin). Officially opened on 30 August 1886. It is the residence of the bishopric of Varna and Preslav and one of the symbols of Varna. History=Preparations and planning During Russian Knyaz Dondukov- Korsakov's visit to Varna, he noticed the need for a cathedral church that would suit the needs of the growing city's population of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Metropolitan Simeon gathered the community to elect a commission aimed at preparing the construction of a new church, particularly selecting the spot, raising money and securing timber and building materials. The construction was evaluated at 300‚Äì400,000 French francs, most of them expected to be collected by means of voluntary donations. The 15,000 francs that were initially collected were quickly laid out, but the Bulgarian government granted a sum of 100,000 leva and a lottery of 150,000 2-lev tickets was run. Primarily materials from the vicinity of Varna were used for the construction of the cathedral. Stones from the destroyed fortified walls of the city were collected, material for the fa√ßade was brought from the neighbouring villages of Lyuben Karavelovo and Kumanovo, the inner columns were made of local stone. The outer columns under the windows used stone from Rousse and the arches relied on limy freestone. Copper plates for the roof, as well as elevating gear to lift the blocks of stone, were brought from England. Top view. The foundation stone was laid by Bulgarian Knyaz Alexander on 22 August 1880 after a solemn ceremony and prayer in front of a crowd of Bulgarians and Armenians. The Knyaz gave amnesty to all the local prisoners that had three months or less left to spend in prison. The name that was chosen, Dormition of the Theotokos, was in memory of Russian Empress consort Maria Alexandrovna, a benefactress of Bulgaria and aunt of the Bulgarian knyaz, who had recently died. The initially selected spot was not liked by the knyaz, who preferred a location on a hill in the then-outskirts of the city, where a garden could also be arranged and so that the cathedral could be seen from the whole city. Construction The project for the cathedral, modelled after the temple in the Peterhof Palace, was by an Odessan architect by the name of Maas. Construction began immediately after the foundation stone was laid and took six years. Initially, the local government concluded a 6,000-leva contract with the architect, but he soon asked for more resources, so the commission decided to buy his plans but not engage him with the construction. Thus, the foundations were laid after the plan of Maas, whereas the building itself followed the plan of municipal architect P. Kupka. According to the project, the cathedral is a three-naved cross-domed basilica featuring two aisles and sized of 35 by 35 m, with the main altar being dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos, the north one to Saint Alexander Nevsky and the south one to Saint Nicholas the Miracle Worker. The issue of selecting a master builder was discussed in the summer of 1880, but the negotiations with Kolyu Ficheto from Tarnovo proved unsuccessful. Local master Vasil Ivanov was given the temporary guidance, the job was however was assigned to Yanko Kostandi after a long search. On 15 March 1884, the commission entrusted Gencho Kanchev from Tryavna with the task. The temple was erected in the following year, the roof was finished in September and the first church service was given on 30 August 1886. View of the interior. Furnishing The furnishing of the interior, however, also continued in the following years. The bishop's throne, the work of Niko Mavrudi, was placed in 1897 and the iconostasis was manufactured later by master Ivan Filipov from Debar. It was decided that a new and separate bell tower would not be erected and instead a dome would be lifted and a part of the original building adapted for the purpose. The bell was supposed to weigh 100 poods (1.6 tons) and bear the inscription \\"In honour of the Liberator\\". 42 small and 3 large icons were brought from Russia as a donation by Nicholas II in 1901, additional 8 intended for the middle and north doors following in 1904. The church's floor was covered with ceramic tiles of different colours in 1911 and the balcony was finished four years later. The 38 m-high belfry was fully erected between 1941 and 1943 by architect Stefan Venedict Popow, the domes took their current appearance in the period, steam heating was installed and the construction of the roof was changed as well. It was initially very hard to find a contractor to sponsor the repairs, as well as the securing and transportation of materials. The decoration of the Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral began after 1949 under Professor N. Rostovtsev, who donated the narthex murals. The chandeliers that were then installed were the work of woodcarver P. Kushlev. The large painted windows were installed in the 1960s. Saints Cyril and Methodius are depicted on the larger south ones (looking towards the square), while the north ones portray St Angelarius and St Clement of Ohrid. The copper domes, damaged by patina, were reconstructed and gilded in the spring of 2000. The fa√ßade was renovated the same year.

Design The granite feature on the top of Heritage Plaza was designed to imitate a Mayan temple Heritage Plaza is well known because of its central location in the central business district skyline, and for the stepped granite feature located on the top of the building that resembles a Mayan pyramid. This feature was inspired by the architect's visit to the Mexican Yucat√°n Peninsula. The crown of the building is also said to resemble an image of a bald eagle spreading its wings. The interior lobby of Heritage Plaza was also designed with Mexican influences. The lower levels of the building, which contain a large food court, contain a distinctive multi-level marble waterfall that falls from the lobby. Heritage Plaza is one of the few skyscrapers in downtown Houston that is not directly connected to the extensive Houston tunnel network.

Yem Sambaur was an influential political figure in Cambodia, mainly during the turbulent years between the end of World War II and final achievement of independence in 1953. Although Sambaur maintained close relationships with the palace and traditional elites of Khmer society, he was initially a member of the Cambodian Democratic Party, a heavily left-leaning coalition of groups which favored immediate independence, a Cambodian government modeled after the French Fourth Republic and sympathized with the armed resistance of the Khmer Issarak guerrilla movements. Unsatisfied with these goals, Sambaur left the Democratic Party in November 1948, taking along with him eleven other deputies, and aligned himself with the Liberal Party (Kanak Sereipheap) led by Prince Norodom Norindeth which had French support and favored gradual independence, a strong monarch and close ties with France. Sambaur's defection left the Democratic Party temporarily, but severely, weakened and allowed more the more radical elements including Hu Nim, Ieng Sary and Saloth Sar (later known as Pol Pot), to gain influence in the party. Although the Democratic Party was later dissolved in 1957, these names would haunt Cambodia decades later. After the sudden death of Prime Minister Prince Sisowath Youtevong, the leader and founder of the Democratic Party on 11 July 1947, the unstable fledgling Cambodian polity saw three governments in an 18-month period, all headed by the Democratic Party. In January 1949 Sambaur, as commissioner of the police, exposed a political scandal involving Cambodia's fisheries and Prime Minister Penn Nouth who was forced to step down. King Norodom Sihanouk then persuaded Ieu Koeus, the president of the National Assembly to appoint Sambaur as the new Prime Minister. On 1 February 1949, he then formed a coalition government with Liberal Party deputies with the backing of the king and the support of the French. During his term, he was constantly opposed by the Democrat led Assembly and faced popular criticism for his plans to open a casino. The criticism intensified when Minister of Education Meas Saem closed the Lycee Sisowath in response to the protests. Sambaur's government fell in September 1949. The Democratic Party again took the reins with Ieu Koeus as Prime Minister. His administration lasted nine days until the King, tired of ministerial instability, took advantage of ambiguous wording in the Democratic Party drafted constitution and stepped in. Asserting his newly claimed powers, the King dissolved the National Assembly, postponed elections and formed a new government without an Assembly and named Sambour Prime Minister again. As an ally of Sihanouk, he continued to support efforts by Shihanouk to gain concessions from the French and move towards independence. Sambaur resigned in April 1950 and Sihanouk himself became Prime Minister. Twenty years later, after the Cambodian coup of 1970 that deposed Sihanouk and placed Lon Nol in power, Sambaur wrote an essay defending his withdrawal of support for the King entitled (\\"Why We Abandoned Sihanouk\\").

The town is located approximately 16 km south from the Marine Atlantic Ferry Terminal in Port aux Basques along Route 470. There are two walking trails: Harvey Trail, named after George Harvey and his family (information below), and Boat Cove Trail, named for Boat Cove Pond, where residents obtained drinking water years ago. These two trails offer a great view of the harbour and the town. The Walters House museum, which is in an old-style house which shows what life was like in the past in Isle aux Morts. The house acted as the first school and church in Isle aux Morts. Currently, the town contains one convenience store, a local bar and a school housing students from kindergarten to grade 9. During the summer season there is a museum and local cafe open. In the larger and nearby town of Port aux Basques, there are several other facilities that residents can avail of, including grocery stores, shopping malls, restaurants, a state of the art sports complex and numerous other services. In the summer, usually late July, there is a week long festival, Ann Harvey Days commemorating Ann Harvey and her family for their brave and daring rescues of sailors stranded on sinking ships, on two occasions. (more information below)  History  Isle aux Morts has a rich Atlantic heritage and popular coastal scenery. The community was first settled as a fishing port on nearby islands. In the 1800's the families moved from the islands to land and settled in what is now present day Isle aux Morts. In 1868, the first school was built and was also used as a chapel for church services. Today it is the \\"Walters House Museum.\\" The local orange lodge was constructed in 1914 with free labor by a group of men who previously used the school for their meetings. The first fishery products plant was constructed in 1939 and burned down in 1943. Another was built and became the heart of the community for the next fifty years. LeGallais Memorial, was built in 1958 and served as a grade school until 1989 when the new LeGallais Memorial school was open. In the early 2000s the highschool students from this school began being bused to neighboring Port aux Basques due to declining enrolment. The town is mentioned in the lyrics to the Tragically Hip song \\"The Dire Wolf\\" on their In Violet Light album.  Name origin  The town is named after a formerly inhabited nearby island and is a reference to the many shipwrecks off the coast. Isle aux Morts translates from old French as \\"Island of the Dead\\".  Archeology  On November 26, 1981, Wayne Mushrow discovered a very rare and working Portuguese mariner's astrolabe on a shipwreck near Isle aux Morts. The year \\"1628\\" and \\"Y. Dyas\\" are stamped on the astrolabe, indicating that it was likely made by known astrolabe maker Joas Dyas. Portuguese mariner's astrolabes are unique because they are graduated for zenith distance only. In 1983, at the same site, Mushrow found a French mariner's astrolabe stamped with the year \\"1617\\" and the name \\"Adrian Holland\\". It is unknown whether he was the maker or owner of the astrolabe. In 2001, the Mushrow Astrolabes were designated heritage treasures by the provincial government and placed in the collection of the Provincial Museum of Newfoundland and Labrador.  Sports and Recreation  There is an outdoor ice rink maintained by volunteers and in Port aux Basques, 16km away, there is a state of the art sports complex with a ice rink, curling rink, bowling alley, swimming pool and fitness center. The vast country and barren landscape make snowmobile and ATV use very popular. Each February there is a Winter Classic Pond Hockey Tournament on a pond in the community where locals and ex-pats join to break up the long cold winter.  Economy  In the 1970s and 1980s this town, like many others in Newfoundland thrived on the fishing industry and the peak population in the 1980s was near 1200. Since the cod moratorium in the 1990s, the town has struggled and lost near half of its permanent residents because of the closing of the fish plant and many secondary sources of work. Most locals that live in the community commute on a rotational basis for work elsewhere in Newfoundland or Canada. The economy relies heavily on the tourism industry in the summer months. Tourism has grown in recent years with the successful promotion of the annual Ann Harvey Days Festival, the Isle aux Morts Theatre Festival as well as the development and beautification of the local Harvey's Trail. In neighboring communities guided fishing trips and boat tours to nearby resettled ghost towns are available in the summer months.  Notable persons of community  The town is most famously noted for George Harvey, his daughter Ann Harvey, her brother and their dog, Hairy Man. They are known because of their bravery in rescuing sailors from two sinking ships, the Despatch and The Rankin. A chamber opera based on the story of Ann Harvey entitled \\"Ann & Seamus\\" was written for Shallaway - Newfoundland and Labrador Youth in Chorus by Stephen Hatfield in 2007. The opera was based on the narrative poem by Kevin Major.

He became increasing involved in politics as a teenager, when during a small demonstration close to his home town a bullet fired by a British soldier barely missed him, killing the youth behind him. After the creation of the state of Pakistan he briefly joined the Khilafat Movement in Karachi and became the editor of its newspaper, The Independent Leader. Along with other members of the movement, he moved to London in the early 1950s. In the mid 1960s he put himself through college and university, taking a degree in Economics and then, in 1972, a PhD in International Relations from University College, London. He founded the Muslim Institute for Research and Planning in London in 1972 and campaigned through his writings for political Islam.Zafar Bangash, Introduction to In Pursuit of the Power of Islam, 1996 Supporting Iran He publicly declared his support for the Islamic Revolution in Iran of 1979, and was later a defender of Ayatullah Khomeini's fatwa against Salman Rushdie. The Muslim Parliament In 1989 he founded the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain. Although activism was certainly a major part of his life, the core of his work was a unique analysis, understanding and exposition of Muslim history and the contemporary situation facing Muslims which he developed and presented in a series of major writings and speeches. He died in Pretoria, South Africa on 18 April 1996, after attending the International Conference on Creating a New Civilization of Islam. He was an outspoken force in the need for an integrated body of Muslims which could exercise communal interests (the regulation of halal meat and the sighting of the Ramadan moon) and act as a lobbying body in the wider British community, like the Board of Deputies of British Jews.

His parents had fled to East Prussia after the occupation of Berlin by Napoleon, and Albert was born in K√∂nigsberg. Two of Albert's elder brothers were Frederick William IV, King of Prussia from 1840 till 1861, and William I, King of Prussia from 1861 to 1888 and German Emperor from 1871 until 1888. Career In 1819 he joined the Prussian Army as a lieutenant and held the rank of a general of cavalry in 1852. He took part in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War as a cavalry corps commander at the battles of Gitschin and K√∂niggr√§tz. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71 he led a cavalry division at the battles of Wissembourg, W√∂rth and Sedan. He later joined the forces of his nephew Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia and Frederick Francis II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in the campaign against the Arm√©e de la Loire. After the war Albert was awarded the title of a Generaloberst. He died in Berlin, where he is buried at the Charlottenburg Palace Park Mausoleum. He was the 74th Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword. Family In The Hague, on 14 September 1830 Albert married Princess Marianne, daughter of King William I of the Netherlands. The marriage was dissolved on 28 March 1849. They had five children: * Charlotte (b. Schloss Sch√∂nhausen, near Berlin, 21 June 1831 - d. Meiningen, 30 March 1855), married on 18 May 1850 with the future Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. * A son (Prinz-Albrecht-Palais, Wilhelmstra√üe, near Berlin, 4 December 1832). He was either stillborn or lived only a few hours.Genealogical database by Herbert Stoyan [retrieved 18 June 2014]. * Albert (b. Berlin, 8 May 1837 - d. Kamenz, 13 September 1906), married Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg. * Elisabeth (b. Kamenz, 27 August 1840 - d. Kamenz, 9 October 1840). * Alexandrine (b. Berlin, 1 February 1842 - d. Schloss Marley, near Potsdam, 26 March 1906), married on 9 December 1865 to Duke William of Mecklenburg- Schwerin. In Berlin on 13 June 1853, Albert married secondly Rosalie Wilhelmine Johanna von Rauch, daughter of Gustav von Rauch, chief of the Prussian General Staff 1812-1813 and Prussian Minister of War 1837-1841. She was created Countess of Hohenau on 28 May 1853. They had two sons: * Georg Albrecht Wilhelm, Count of Hohenau (b. Albrechtsberg Castle, 25 April 1854 - d. Bad Flinsburg, 28 October 1930). He married to Princess Margarethe of Hohenlohe-√ñhringen (1865-1940), daughter of Hugo zu Hohenlohe-√ñhringen. * Bernhard Wilhelm Albrecht Frederick, Count of Hohenau (b. Albrechtsberg Castle, 21 May 1857 - d. Ochelhermsdorf, 15 April 1914). Albrechtsberg Castle, Dresden. As this second union was considered a morganatic marriage, the couple temporarily had to avoid the Prussian court. Albert acquired a vineyard in Loschwitz near Dresden, Saxony, where he had a residence, Albrechtsberg Castle, erected in 1854. Aftermath In 1830 Albert had acquired a city palace in Berlin on Wilhelmstra√üe, then called Prinz-Albrecht-Palais. An adjacent street off Wilhelmstra√üe laid out in 1891 was named Prinz-Albrecht- Stra√üe. After the Nazi Machtergreifung it became notorious as the seat of the Gestapo and the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS. The Prinz-Albrecht-Palais itself from 1934 served as the headquarters of the SS Sicherheitsdienst under Reinhard Heydrich, from 1939 the Reichssicherheitshauptamt. In 1944 the building was heavily damaged by air raids and finally razed to the ground in 1955, leaving the foundations and cellars exposed to the open air. They remain so today, and are used as part of the Topography of Terror project.

It is affiliated with the Canadian Unitarian Council. It is the largest of six UU congregations and fellowships in the Greater Toronto Area. History The congregation was founded in 1845, the second in Canada after the Montreal congregation. The congregation originally operated in a building on George Street then but moved to 216 Jarvis Street in 1854. In 1949 the congregation moved to its present building at 175 St. Clair Avenue West. In 1952, eight parishioners founded the Elizabeth Fry Society after hearing a speech by Agnes Macphail. Building In 1993, the building underwent extensive renovations. The main space, named Sunderland Hall, was changed from an east-west to a north-south orientation. Workman Hall, which used to back on to Sunderland Hall as a disused stage was remodelled as a separate space and meeting area. Office and classroom spaces were updated and expanded. An airy narthex was added on the side of the building facing St. Clair including a tower with a stained glass window commissioned for the renovated building. The work is entitled Radiance, Reflection, Revelation by artist Sarah Hall. It was later nominated for the Ontario Arts Council's Jean Chalmers Award as the single largest commission for a stained glass work in the Toronto area.Heritage Designation Proposal. 2008. Toronto Preservation Board In September 2007, the city's heritage preservation committee proposed that the building be designated as a heritage property along with eight other church properties in the neighbourhood. At the request of the church's board of trustees, this designation was deferred until the church members could confer on the matter.St. Clair Avenue West Church Survey ‚Äì Inclusion of Nine Properties on Heritage Inventory. September 27, 2007. Toronto Preservation Board and Toronto and East York Community Council. Letter to Preservation Board on the Heritage Designation. December 3, 2007. Richard Kirsh, President, Board of Trustees, First Unitarian Congregation. Governance The congregation is led by a nine-member Board of Trustees including a President and Vice-President. There is also a Treasurer, considered an ex-officio Board member. Trustees are elected by the congregation to three-year terms with the possibility of one renewal. Minister(s) of the church are considered as employees and are not members of the Board (although they frequently attend board meetings). The Board is responsible for forming policy, making decisions on behalf of the congregation and monitoring the congregation's operations within those policies. All Trustees are volunteers. The congregation holds annual meetings to elect new Board members and review and approve the annual budget. Other issues affecting the entire congregation are also voted upon, as the need arises, at special meetings of the congregation. Members One of the prominent founding members was Joseph Workman, known as the \\"Father of Canadian Psychiatry\\". Other notable members include: *Arthur Lismer, a painter, part of the Group of Seven *Sir Francis Hincks, politician *Emily Stowe, the first female doctor to practise in Canada *William Dennison, the mayor of Toronto *Donald Macdonald *Michael Cassidy, leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party.

Allan Brocka and starring Rebekah Kochan, Ryan Carnes, Jim Verraros, Scott Lunsford, and Emily Stiles. Plot After getting dumped by his girlfriend Tiffani von der Sloot (Rebekah Kochan), University of Arizona student Caleb Peterson (Scott Lunsford) commiserates with his roommate Kyle (Jim Verraros), who notes that while he has trouble getting the men he wants, he could get any woman because he is gay. Later at a party, Gwen Anderson (Emily Stiles) dumps her boyfriend after he comes out to her. Caleb sees her and becomes infatuated and meets Marc Everhard (Ryan Carnes), with whom Kyle is infatuated. Marc, meanwhile, sees Caleb and is instantly attracted. Kyle comes up with a crazy scheme. He tells Gwen that Caleb is gay so she'll set him up with Marc. Kyle figures that Caleb can use Marc to get to Gwen, while Kyle uses Caleb to get to Marc. Also, Tiffani lives next door to Gwen and Marc so seeing Caleb date Marc would make her crazy. Caleb and Marc go out on a date then go back to Marc's place to watch a movie. Marc tries to put the moves on Caleb, who is unresponsive. Suddenly Gwen, who is stuck at a friend's house and bored, calls. She talks to Caleb, relaxing and seducing him verbally while Marc takes advantage by performing oral sex on him. Gwen hangs up to come home and Marc masturbates next to Caleb. Caleb, feeling confused and insecure, leaves. He passes Gwen on her way home and she seduces him again, this time physically. They have sex in his convertible. Caleb goes home and goes to bed. The next morning, Marc calls Caleb and leaves a message. Kyle overhears it and realizes that Marc and Caleb had sex. As Kyle storms into his room, Marc calls back. After the call Caleb goes to Kyle and tells him he has invited Gwen and Marc to dinner to clear everything up. He also says that he knows Kyle has feelings for him and that if he were gay he would love him back, and the two share a small kiss. Gwen and Marc come over for dinner and Caleb is chagrined to see that Kyle has invited Caleb's family as well. Kyle convinces Gwen to \\"pretend\\" to be Caleb's date and Marc to \\"pretend\\" to be his. Dinner is going well, if a little awkwardly, until Tiffani inexplicably crashes the party. Gwen takes it upon herself to out Caleb to his parents (Murph Michaels and Mattie van der Voort). His parents take it quite well and everyone ends up in a bizarre group hug. After Caleb's family and Tiffani leave, Gwen verbally attacks Kyle, thinking he is trying to steal Marc from Caleb. She makes it clear that \\"someone like Marc\\" would never go out with \\"someone like him.\\" Caleb convinces Marc to talk to Kyle and Gwen figures out the entire scheme, which she thinks is the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for her in light of the lengths to which Caleb went to sleep with her. Marc goes to talk to Kyle and tells Kyle that he was into him all along, having feigned disinterest this whole time. They finally kiss. In a post-credits scene, Marc and Kyle are shown shirtless, making out in his bed; it is implied they are about to have sex.

The route is one of the most traveled Interstate Highways in Maryland, especially between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., despite alternate routes along the corridor, such as the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, U.S. Route 1 (US 1), and U.S. Route 29. Portions of the highway are tolled. Between the Baltimore city line and the Delaware state line, I-95 is known as the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway. Route description Time-lapse video of a northbound trip on Interstate 95 in Maryland Capital Beltway The I-95/I-495 split in College Park Interstate 95 enters the state of Maryland concurrent with Interstate 495, the Capital Beltway. From Alexandria, Virginia, the roadways, five lanes in either direction, travel together over the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge, briefly cross the southern tip of the District of Columbia (over water), and touch down in Prince George's County west of Forest Heights. I-95/I-495 immediately encounter the southern terminus of Interstate 295, known as the Anacostia Freeway, a route that serves downtown Washington, D.C. and connects to the originally planned alignment of I-95 through D.C., Interstate 395. Just beyond I-295 the two routes interchange with MD 210, a major north‚Äìsouth route into southern D.C. The two Interstates continue along the Capital Beltway, interchanging with various local highways such as MD 5 (Branch Avenue) and MD 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue) on either side of Andrews Air Force Base, which the Beltway travels very close to near its northern edge. Turning north past the MD 4 interchange, the Beltway runs through Glenarden, interchanging with MD 202, US 50/unsigned I-595, and MD 450, the latter route offering access to the New Carrollton metro station and the New Carrollton area. Turning northwest the Beltway enters Greenbelt Park, intersecting the Baltimore-Washington Parkway in the northeastern edge of the park. Just after the B-W Parkway the two routes interchange with MD 201, which connects to the southern terminus of the B-W Parkway at US 50 (New York Avenue) near the D.C. line. Now turned fully west, the Beltway runs through the northern edge of College Park, interchanging with the Greenbelt metro station's access roadway and US 1. Beyond the US 1 interchange, I-95 encounters its own route at the College Park Interchange, and separates from I-495 within this interchange. I-495 continues west, alone, on the Capital Beltway to Interstate 270, while I-95 turns north onto its own planned alignment. The interchange includes access to a Park and Ride. It is marked as Exit 27 on both Interstates. Between the beltways View north along I-95 past MD 216 in Howard County Running northeast, I-95, still eight lanes wide, passes through Beltsville, interchanging with MD 212 near the community. The highway, completed in 1971, runs through undeveloped land to the interchange with the Intercounty Connector toll road (MD 200) before interchanging with MD 198 just west of Laurel. Passing over the Patuxent River just south of the Rocky Gorge Dam, the route enters Howard County and promptly interchanges with MD 216. North of the MD 216 interchange, the route encounters its first rest area in the state of Maryland, with each carriageway served by its own facility. Continuing northeast, I-95 intersects MD 32 at a modified directional cloverleaf. Within this interchange, I-95 grade-separates, with the northbound carriageway passing over MD 32 and the southbound carriageway passing under MD 32, allowing left exits from both of the latter's carriageways to merge into the left lanes of I-95 without conflict. Traffic congestion on I-95 southbound in Baltimore North of this unusual interchange, I-95 encounters MD 175, the main access route into Columbia, at a less-radical directional cloverleaf interchange. After the MD 175 interchange comes the MD 100 interchange, providing access to Ellicott City, US 29, and Interstate 70 to the west, and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and Interstate 97 to the east. Just beyond this interchange, I-95 encounters three more of its auxiliary routes within Maryland: Interstate 895, which splits from I-95 within the Patapsco Valley State Park, just south of the Patapsco River (and at which point the road enters southwestern Baltimore County); Interstate 195 and MD 166 near Catonsville, a short spur to Baltimore-Washington International Airport, and Interstate 695 near Halethorpe, the Baltimore Beltway, a full-circle beltway around Baltimore that offers a full freeway bypass of the city and that connects to Interstate 70, Interstate 83, and Interstate 97. Traffic not authorized to make use of either of the direct (tunnel) routes through Baltimore is encouraged to use the eastern half of I-695, which crosses the Patapsco River via the Francis Scott Key Bridge. When this part of I-95 opened to traffic in 1971, all interchanges in the stretch had high-mast lighting, but beginning in 2010, these were replaced with lower-mounted conventional streetlights. However, the MD 200 and southern I-895 interchanges (which opened in 1973 as part of an extension from its original terminus at US 1) now have high-mast lights. Within Baltimore I-95 northbound at Washington Boulevard in Baltimore. These signs, gantries and lights have been replaced with newer ones. I-95 northbound through the Fort McHenry Tunnel in Baltimore South of Baltimore, I-95 is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration; north of the southern Baltimore city line, I-95 changes jurisdiction to the Maryland Transportation Authority. Continuing on its northeasterly track, the route intersects US 1 Alt. just beyond the city line. I-95's interchange with US 1 Alt. incorporates stubs and unused embankments that would have been used for the planned eastern terminus of I-70 within Baltimore (later planned as the southern terminus of I-595, though the freeway was later cancelled and that designation was moved to US 50 east of Washington). Continuing past this unbuilt interchange, I-95 intersects Washington Blvd., a local city street (with ramps to the southbound side and from the northbound side), before encountering the main access route into the central business district, Interstate 395. I-95 also interchanges with the northern terminus of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway (and the southern terminus of Russell Street, with ramps to the transitioning roads and from the terminating ones) within the I-395 interchange, which is almost completely elevated over the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River. After interchanging with both routes, I-95 interchanges with MD 2 and Key Highway, the latter route offering access to Fort McHenry and an escape route for hazardous material traffic. I-95 encounters the Fort McHenry Tunnel south of Fort McHenry. The tunnel, containing eight lanes, curves underneath the Northwest Harbor and emerges in the Canton neighborhood of Baltimore, quickly encountering the toll plaza. After the toll plaza, I-95 encounters the Boston St.-O'Donnell St. interchange, which also incorporates stubs and other unused infrastructure planned to be used for the southern terminus of Interstate 83; I-95 also passes over I-895 within the interchange area, with no access between the two routes, then runs into East Baltimore, providing local access to various city streets (a northbound-only exit to Dundalk Avenue and a 3/4 interchange with Eastern Avenue, which share southbound access ramps via Kane Street) in lieu of I-895. It interchanges with the Moravia Road freeway spur next to the Baltimore city line (where ramp stubs were once planned for an unbuilt portion of the Windlass Freeway), then connects with US 40 before narrowing to six lanes and merging with I-895 just after exiting Baltimore into northeastern Baltimore County. From 2009 to 2015, new gray gantries were installed that displayed signs in the Clearview font which was being adopted statewide, replacing the old brown gantries and Highway Gothic signs (some of which had button copy). In 2017, the high-mast poles, which were also brown, were taken down and replaced with new gray ones as well. John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway I-95 northbound at entrance to express toll lanes in Baltimore The John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway portion of I-95, a toll facility operated by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA), begins at the end of the Harbor Tunnel Thruway (I-895) (also operated by MDTA) at the Baltimore city line. Starting out eight lanes wide at the junction with I-895, after three miles (3 km), I-95 once again intersects with Interstate 695 in Rosedale at what was a unique double-crossover interchange. Within this interchange, the carriageways of I-95 narrowed to six lanes and crossed over each other, thereby putting through traffic on the left within the interchange nexus, allowing left exit ramps and left entrance ramps to accommodate four of the eight movements in lieu of flyovers. Beyond the interchange, both sets of carriageways crossed over each other again and resumed right-hand running. As part of the upgrades to Interstate 95 to accommodate express toll lanes in this area, this interchange was replaced with a more conventional four-level stack; all exits are now on the right, and I-95's carriageways no longer cross over one another; a similar project also eliminated the crossovers on I-695. Continuing to the northeast, parallel with the Chesapeake Bay, the route encounters MD 43 near White Marsh. After passing through Gunpowder Falls State Park, and into Harford County, the route interchanges with MD 152 north of Joppatowne, then with MD 24, providing access to Bel Air and Edgewood. Within the MD 24 interchange, I-95 narrows to six lanes and remains this wide to the Delaware border. Sign at Maryland House identifying the road as the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway I-95 crossing the Susquehanna River via the Millard E. Tydings Memorial Bridge Just beyond MD 543, I-95's carriageways split apart to provide space for the Maryland House service area. Beyond Maryland House, the route encounters the MD 22 interchange in Aberdeen, providing access to the Aberdeen Proving Ground. South of the Susquehanna State Park, I-95 encounters the southern end of the remaining tolled portion of the highway at the MD 155 interchange, providing access to Havre de Grace and US 40. (Until the 1980s, there were tolls to enter I-95 southbound and exit it northbound in Harford County.) North of this interchange, I-95 becomes a true toll route as it passes through the Susquehanna State Park before crossing the Millard E. Tydings Memorial Bridge over the Susquehanna River. The bridge crosses between bluffs high above the river valley, and is posted with warning signs: \\"Subject to Crosswinds\\". The highway now enters Cecil County. Just beyond the bridge is the JFK Highway toll plaza at Perryville, where tolls are collected in the northbound direction only (originally in both directions). There are no southbound tolls on the highway, but southbound truck traffic may need to stop at a nearby weigh station. At the northern end of the plaza is Exit 93 for MD 222 in Perryville, before continuing through Cecil County toward the Delaware State line. (Until the 1980s, there were tolls at the southbound exits and northbound entrances, at the Perryville and North East interchanges.) The \\"North East Rising Sun\\" exit off I-95 in northern Maryland has been read by some drivers, including children's writer Katherine Paterson, as referring to a single exotically-named location. Still paralleling the northern shore of the Chesapeake Bay, I-95's carriageways split apart again to encounter another service area, Chesapeake House. Now past the northern tip of the bay, north of Elk Neck State Park, the route encounters MD 272, which provides access to the towns of North East and Rising Sun. Having turned east, the route now runs straight towards the Delaware state line, passing under MD 213 north of Elkton with no access offered, and then reaching the Exit 109 interchange with MD 279, which provides a direct route into Elkton and Newark, Delaware. I-95's run through Maryland comes to an end quickly after that exit, and it crosses the Delaware state line, becomes the Delaware Turnpike, and soon reaches the Newark toll plaza (in 2012, the MDTA installed signs prior to and at the MD 279 interchange informing motorists of the Delaware toll plaza ahead). Similar to what was done on the between the Beltways segment, new lighting projects have replaced the original high-mast lights with conventional streetlights at the MD 152 and MD 155 interchanges, but new high-masts were installed from the Perryville toll plaza to MD 222. Additionally, there are now high-mast lights at the northern I-695 interchange in Rosedale to match its southern counterpart in Halethorpe (although the ones in Halethorpe were removed by 2018); those replaced the conventional streetlights that had existed within the area. =Express lanes= Sign listing rates for the express toll lanes along I-95 in Baltimore I-95 has express toll lanes in the median between the I-895 merge in northern Baltimore to just north of MD 43 in White Marsh, with two express toll lanes in each direction. In addition to access to and from I-95 at both ends, the express toll lanes have a southbound exit and northbound entrance with I-895, a southbound exit and northbound entrance with Moravia Road via I-895, and a northbound exit and southbound entrance with MD 43. The express toll lanes utilize all-electronic tolling; tolls are collected by E-ZPass or Video Tolling, which uses automatic license plate recognition and sends a bill in the mail to the vehicle owner. Video Tolling users pay an additional 50% surcharge on their tolls. The toll rates along the express toll lanes vary by time of day and the day of the week. Peak travel times, which is southbound during weekday mornings, northbound during weekday evenings, and both directions on weekend afternoons, have the highest rates. Off-peak travel times, which occur during the daytime outside of peak travel times, have lower rates, with the overnight hours having the lowest rates. Service areas Just as in Delaware, the northern segment of I-95 in Maryland has service areas in the median that serve both directions of traffic. This dates back to its days as a two-state toll highway. Between the Delaware line and the Baltimore city line, two service areas are available, owned by the Maryland Transportation Authority and run by Areas USA (both offering bus parking, free WiFi, a Kids Korner seating area, an outdoor seating area, and Sunoco as the fuel offering): Maryland House Maryland House, opened in 1963, is at milepost 81.9 in Harford County. It was later remodeled in 1987, and wing additions were added in 1989‚Äì1990. It was closed on September 15, 2012, and demolished for reconstruction, and reopened on January 16, 2014, with Auntie Anne's, Carvel, Currito Burrito, Dunkin' Donuts, Jerry's Subs & Pizza, Nathan's Famous, Phillips Seafood, and Wendy's as the current food offerings. Retail shopping includes Bijoux Terner, Brookstone, Orange Optix, and Sunshine Market.

Unlike the two full service rest areas, which are located in the median, this rest area is located on the shoulders, with separate facilities for each direction of travel. This rest area also features only rest rooms, a tourist information area, and vending machines, in contrast to the full food and fuel options at the two service areas further north. History An older version of the I-95 shield as used in Maryland Northeast Freeway Under the original plans for Interstate 95 in Maryland, the route would not have followed the eastern half of the Capital Beltway from the Woodrow Wilson Bridge to the College Park Interchange. Instead, it would have exited the District at New Hampshire Avenue (MD 650), following the Northeast Freeway, and after passing through Northwest Branch Park, junctioned I-495 at the College Park Interchange, integrating seamlessly with the existing segment of I-95 at that interchange. This route was canceled in 1977, and I-95 rerouted, after the District government canceled the North Central Freeway, which would have linked to the Northeast Freeway at its southern end and carried I-95 deeper into the District, connecting to the Inner Loop. The part of I-95 that was completed from downtown Washington to the Springfield Interchange in Springfield, Virginia, was then re-designated as I-395. I-95 in Baltimore I-95 northbound approaching downtown Baltimore at Washington Boulevard exit, with newer signs and lighting installed =Planning= Several proposals were made during the 1940s and 1950s for an East‚ÄìWest Expressway through Baltimore. After nine different proposals were floated, the city's Department of Planning published a proposal of its own in 1960. The route in the proposal would have started out as Interstate 70N (as it was known then) and run due east through vast city parkland before picking up the small piece of freeway that was constructed within the Franklin St.-Mulberry St. corridor, and then crossing the city to the north of the Inner Harbor on an elevated viaduct within the central business district (CBD). The route would have met two other freeways‚Äîthe Jones Falls Expressway and the Southwest Expressway‚Äîat a four-way interchange in the southeast edge of the CBD; I-95 would have followed the Southwest Expressway, and met both I-70N and I-83 (on the Jones Falls Expressway) at this interchange. I-70N and I-83 would have terminated at the interchange, while I-95 would have turned east and followed the East‚ÄìWest Expressway out of the CBD, along the Boston Street corridor and out towards East Baltimore, intersecting the Harbor Tunnel Thruway near today's Exit 62. The Southwest Expressway would have cut through Federal Hill and crossed the Inner Harbor on a fixed bridge with of vertical navigational clearance. All of these proposed routes would have required extensive right-of-way acquisition and clearance.Kozel, Scott. Roads to the Future: Baltimore Early Expressway Planning URL accessed 17:55, February 5, 2007. The above routings were eventually further refined and modified and eventually became part of the Baltimore 10-D Interstate System, approved in 1962. In this plan, I-95 would run east‚Äìwest to the north of Fort McHenry, similarly to the above proposal, but would have run along the southern edge of the CBD, passing to the north of Federal Hill and cutting through the historic Fells Point neighborhood. After crossing the Inner Harbor on another low bridge, it would have followed the Boston Street corridor, crossing the Harbor Tunnel Thruway near to where it does today, then followed the existing I-95 alignment out of the city. The highway would have junctioned Interstate 70N a mile to the northwest of the Inner Harbor, near the eastern terminus of the now-defunct Interstate 170; it would have met Interstate 83 in the northeastern corner of the central business district. This routing was little different from the routings proposed in 1960, and was also universally disliked. I-95 at I-395 in Baltimore By 1969, the Design Concept Team, a multi-discipline group assembled in 1966 by the city government to help design freeway routings that would not disrupt the city's fabric, the 10-D System had been replaced by the Baltimore 3-A Interstate and Boulevard System. In the 3-A system, I-95 was shifted south onto the Locust Point peninsula, and eventually constructed there. I-70N would have run through Leakin Park and Gwynns Falls Park to terminate at I-95 near Alt US 1 (with the I-170 spur serving the areas to the immediate west of the CBD, where it would terminate), while I-83 was shifted to a new alignment and planned to terminate at I-95 north of the Patapsco River. Interstate 395 was also brought into existence under this plan; it was planned as a freeway spur from I-95 to the south edge of the central business district, connecting to a new route named City Boulevard (now known as Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). The 3-A System's result was that I-95 would act as a bypass of the central business district, with I-395 providing direct access. =Construction= The first portion of I-95 in Baltimore was the southern of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway, completed in 1963. By 1971, I-95 had entered Baltimore proper when it was completed between the Capital Beltway and the Baltimore Beltway; beyond the southern I-695 interchange, the highway came to a dead halt at Alt US 1. By 1974, I-95 was under construction in East Baltimore between its current merge with I-895 south to a partial-cloverleaf interchange with MD 150 Eastern Avenue. By 1976, I-95 was under construction east of Alt US 1 and south of MD 150. By 1981, I-95 was completed as far as I-395, and by 1984, with the construction of the Fort McHenry Tunnel quite advanced, the route was open as far as MD 2 west of the Patapsco, and Boston St.-O'Donnell St. east of the Patapsco. With the final opening of the tunnel on November 23, 1985, I-95 was finally completed within the city of Baltimore. =Tolling= Northbound in the E-ZPass tube of the Fort McHenry Tunnel Originally, the toll plaza at the north end of the Fort McHenry Tunnel was to be removed after the city of Baltimore repaid its share of the construction costs of the tunnel. However, the Maryland Transportation Authority lobbied successfully to keep the toll plaza in place to prevent a traffic problem on I-95 within Baltimore. John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway Despite the route's inclusion in the Interstate Highway System in the mid-1950s, the construction of the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. beltways had diverted most of the state funds that would have been used to build it. To relieve traffic on U.S. Route 40, it was decided to finance construction using a bond issue. The Maryland State Roads Commission, the predecessor to the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA), floated $73 million in revenue bonds to provide funds to start construction of the route, which began in January 1962. Completed in 1963, the 48 mile Northeastern Expressway and the adjoining 11 mile Delaware Turnpike were dedicated by President John F. Kennedy on Thursday, November 14, 1963, at a ceremony at the Mason‚ÄìDixon line. In 1964, the highway was renamed the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway after his assassination in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, eight days after President Kennedy was on hand for the opening of the two highways. I-95 northbound at the MD 43 exit in White Marsh Between 1963 and 1993, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway was a tolled facility for the entire length of the roadway in both directions. The mainline toll plaza is situated just north of the Tydings Bridge in Perryville. The southbound toll plaza was removed in 1991, but tolls are still collected for northbound traffic over the Tydings Bridge at this location. Additionally, ramp tolls were collected at many of the interchanges until they were abolished by an act of the legislature in 1981. The highway and bridge are maintained by the MDTA. Exits on the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway were originally numbered consecutively, beginning with exit 1. As a result, Interstate 95 in Maryland had multiple conflicting sequences of exit numbers. In the mid-1980s, the exits were re-numbered according to a statewide, mileage-based numbering system, so that they now range from Exit 2 (I-295 north) on the Capital Beltway to Exit 109 (MD 279) on the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway. To allow a seamless connection between the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway and the then-unnumbered Harbor Tunnel Thruway, a partial interchange was constructed for I-95 to continue south into Baltimore City. However, this meant that I-95 had to enter from and exit to the right, as evidenced by a southbound flyover ramp; a construction project corrected the problem in 2009 so that I-95 would proceed straight through the interchange. Express toll lanes were built from the I-895 merge in northern Baltimore to just north of MD 43. The ETLs opened Saturday, December 6, 2014, after more than 8 years of construction. Construction of the I-95 ETLs was part of the $1.1 billion I-95 Improvement Project, which included $756 million in highway and safety improvements along eight miles of I-95 from the I-895 interchange to just north of White Marsh Boulevard (MD 43) in northeast Baltimore. Changes in jurisdiction Originally, there were several changes in jurisdiction over maintenance of Baltimore's segment of I-95. North of the Baltimore city line as far as Exit 55 (Key Highway), the route was maintained by the city of Baltimore. Between Exit 55 and Exit 57 (Boston Street/O'Donnell Street) the route, traversing the Fort McHenry Tunnel, was maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority. Between Exit 57 and the Baltimore city line the route was again maintained by the city of Baltimore. Now, between the southern Baltimore city line (near Exit 49, the southern I-695 interchange) and the northern Baltimore city line, the route is maintained entirely by the Maryland Transportation Authority.Kozel, Scott. misc.transport.road: Re: Road trip report: New York, NY to Baltimore, MD/Washington, DC and back URL accessed 13:04, February 4, 2007. Maryland state highway police force and the authority's own police force share police duties on this segment. Additionally, the city of Baltimore pays the MdTA to maintain I-95 within the city limits. Incomplete interchanges I-95 has at least four incomplete interchanges along its route, with three located within the city of Baltimore. Traveling northbound, the first interchange encountered is the College Park Interchange, exit 27. This was the intended site of the northern crossing of I-95 and I-495 and the northern end of the Northeast Freeway. South of here, I-95 was to enter the District on the Northeast Freeway, continue on the North Central Freeway and connect seamlessly to the portion of I-95 in downtown Washington that had been completed from there to the Springfield Interchange in Virginia. While the College Park interchange was completed, the Northeast Freeway was never built, resulting in highway lanes coming to an abrupt end on the south end of the interchange. After the project to complete I-95 through the District of Columbia was canceled, I-95 was rerouted onto the Capital Beltway in 1977. The portion of I-95 inside the beltway in Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia was designated as Interstate 395. The eastern half of the Capital Beltway was renumbered from I-495 to I-95. In 1991, the I-495 designation was restored on the eastern half of the beltway, numbered concurrently with I-95 as part of an effort to provide more consistent numbering and directional indicators on the Capital Beltway. The College Park interchange was modified in late 1986 to allow free movement along the transition from the I-95 corridor and the Capital Beltway without requiring the use of exit ramps. Today, all parts of the interchange are in regular use. The southern end of the interchange now serves as a Park and Ride commuter lot. The other three interchanges are located in the city of Baltimore, a sign of the many successful freeway revolts that accompanied the construction of the 3-A System: the planned eastern terminus of Interstate 70; the planned southern terminus of Interstate 83; and the planned southern terminus of the Windlass Freeway. All three unbuilt interchanges incorporate interchanges with local roads. The first is located near Exit 50 in Baltimore; it is the site of the planned eastern terminus of Interstate 70 within the city. The only remnants of the interchange that remain in situ today are the mainline bridges built to grade-separate I-95 and the exit ramps to and from I-70, several ramp stubs, a few grassy abutments. An incomplete flyover bridge once existed as well, but was later demolished. Narrow shoulders through the interchange area show that I-95 narrowed to six lanes, but was restriped to widen the highway. While this interchange was left incomplete, the existing Exit 50, built with extensive collector-distributor lanes due to its proximity to the unbuilt interchange, stands as a more visible sign of what was planned. Today, Exit 50 connects Alt US 1 to I-95.Scale drawing of I-70, I-170, I-95, I-395 interchanges in Baltimore City The second is located near Exit 57, just to the north of the Fort McHenry Tunnel, and is the site of the planned southern terminus of Interstate 83. Like I-70's terminus, the remnants here consist mainly of ramp stubs and unused bridges. This interchange, like Exit 50, also serves Boston Street and O'Donnell Street, and also narrowed to six lanes within the interchange area until 2018 when two new lanes were taken from the left shoulders. The interchange would have been a 3-way freeway-to-freeway interchange, with a full complement of ramps provided for local access to and from Boston Street and O'Donnell Street, to and from both Interstates.Scale diagram of I-83/I-95 interchange in Baltimore City Of the two planned Interstate termini, I-83's terminus was the first to be abandoned, with the connecting highway segment being cancelled in September 1982; I-70's terminus, later redesignated as a new route, was cancelled in July 1983.Kozel, Scott. misc.transport.road: Baltimore Interstate Highway Cancellation Details URL accessed 12:57, February 4, 2007. The third is encountered at Exit 60 and is the site of the southwestern terminus of the Windlass Freeway, a relief route for US 40 (part of the route was eventually built and is today part of I-695). The interchange that exists at this site is in partial use, serving the Moravia Road freeway spur; like the other two inner-city locations, ramp stubs mark the site of the ramps to and from the unbuilt freeway. Major events *On January 13, 2004, a tanker truck carrying flammable liquid fell off the southbound ramp from the Harbor Tunnel Thruway to I-95, landing on the travel lanes and causing a massive explosion, crushing several vehicles and killing four.Kozel, Scott.

Freak storm is blamed in October I-95 pileups *On January 16, 2007, an exhausted truck driver lost control of his tanker truck, causing it to overturn on the northbound carriageway near Maryland House in Harford County. The route was closed for a time when leaks were discovered in the tank, which was carrying a corrosive alkaline material; the outermost right lane remained closed until 3:00 pm that day.Baltimore Sun. I-95 reopens nearly 15 hours after tanker truck overturns URL accessed 13:22, January 26, 2007. *On October 4, 2008, at around 2:00 am, a tanker carrying acetone overturned on the southbound lanes south of exit 85, closing down both the northbound and southbound lanes for over eight hours. According to State Police, the tanker leaked acetone and other flammable liquids after overturning. Four others were also involved in the crash and were taken to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore. Both the northbound and southbound lanes reopened at around 11:00 am on the same day. Improvements Due to the heavy use of this route by commuters and through traffic, the Maryland Transportation Authority has begun the process of significantly expanding the highway to increase its capacity. The expansion plans are divided into short, individual sections; in 2001, the MDTA began public studies to determine the best way to expand the highway to meet current and future needs. After four years of study, the MDTA issued its results for Section 100, the southernmost section. Section 100 Construction of the eastern interchange of I-95 and I-695 Section 100 is an eight-mile (13 km) segment of the JFK Highway that runs between Exit 62 (Interstate 895) and milepost 70. This segment used to be just eight lanes wide (a 4‚Äì4 configuration) and carries approximately 165,000 vehicles per day (expected to increase to 225,000 vehicles per day by 2025). This segment has been expanded to twelve lanes (a 4-2-2-4 configuration), with the center lanes designated as express toll lanes. In addition, the interchange between the JFK Highway and the Baltimore Beltway at Exit 64 has been rebuilt into a more orthodox stack interchange, removing the left entrances and exits as well as the unique carriageway crossovers on I-95 (the carriageway crossovers on I-695 there remained, but those have since been removed as well). The interchange at Exit 67 (MD 43) has been significantly modified from its former cloverleaf configuration, and the interchange at Exit 62 was also reconfigured so that I-95 is now the straight-ahead route instead of I-895, thus eliminating the need for southbound I-95 traffic to weave to the right and cross over. The project cost $1.1 billion. It began in 2006 and was completed in 2014. Section 200 Section 200 is a segment from milepost 70 to Exit 85 (MD 22). This segment is also currently eight lanes wide (a 4‚Äì4 configuration) as far as Exit 77 (MD 24), and is currently six lanes wide (a 3‚Äì3 configuration) between Exit 77 and Exit 85. Like Section 100, this segment will likely be widened into a 4-2-2-4 configuration as far as Exit 80 (MD 543). Between Exit 80 and Exit 85, the remainder will likely be widened from a 3‚Äì3 configuration to a 4‚Äì4 configuration. While the MdTA has not yet finalized plans for this segment, the MD 24 interchange was improved, with the interchange improvement project completed in 2009. Section 300 Section 300 is a three-mile (5 km) segment from Exit 77 to Exit 80. Plans for its widening are described above. Section 400 Section 400, the longest segment, is long and stretches from Exit 80 to the Delaware border. This segment is six lanes wide (a 3‚Äì3 configuration) and is likely to be widened into a 4‚Äì4 configuration. This segment will require major reconstruction of the Millard E. Tydings Memorial Bridge. Between the beltways A study is currently underway to consider adding a new lane on each side between I-495 and I-695. This would be done by constructing new inner shoulders on the median and converting the existing inner shoulders to high occupancy vehicle lanes that would be open to vehicles with three or more occupants, hybrid and electric vehicles, emergency vehicles, and other official government vehicles. Proposed relocation of toll plaza The MDTA, at the request of an assortment of elected officials, completed a study which examined a relocation of the northbound toll barrier, which is currently just north of the Tydings Bridge crossing of the Susquehanna River at Perryville. The study concluded the barrier should remain where it is, because \\"relocating the toll plaza from the current location would result in significant diversion from I-95 onto local Cecil County roads\\" and \\"the closer the toll plaza goes to Delaware the greater the diversion there is to local roads, the greater the revenue loss to the state toll operator MDTA, and the more travel there is on slower, less safe surface arterials.\\" Exit listAuxiliary routes Interstate 95 in Maryland has eight auxiliary routes, more than any other state along the I-95 corridor: *Interstate 195, a spur into Baltimore-Washington International Airport *Interstate 295, a southern route into Washington D.C. *Interstate 395, a spur into downtown Baltimore *Interstate 495, the Capital Beltway *Interstate 595, an unsigned segment of US 50 between the Capital Beltway and Annapolis *Interstate 695, the Baltimore Beltway *Interstate 795, a bypass of MD 140 in Reisterstown and Owings Mills *Interstate 895, the Harbor Tunnel Thruway See also * ReferencesNotesExternal links *Exitlists.com (I-95) *I-95 @ MDRoads.com *Steve Anderson's DCRoads.net: Capital Beltway (I-495 and I-95) *Steve Anderson's DCRoads.net: Interstate 95-Maryland (\\"Between the Beltways\\") *Steve Anderson's DCRoads.net: Interstate 95-Maryland (Baltimore City Section) *Steve Anderson's DCRoads.net: John F.

He and his wife have written several books on magic and related subjects such as The Magic Power of Witchcraft. He appeared on national television's Phil Donahue Show, PM Magazine, Tom Snyder's Tomorrow Show and others, at many events serving the Neo-Pagan community such as Stones Rising, Sirius Rising, Pagan Pride Day, and the Starwood Festival, and in newspaper and magazine articles across the United States.Church and School of Wicca (2004). Who are Gavin and Yvonne Frost? . Early life Frost was born in Aldridge, Staffordshire, England, on November 20, 1930. In 1952, Frost graduated from King's College London with honours, gaining a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics, and after completing his post doctoral thesis with the Department of Atomic Energy in Cumbria, he received a Doctorate in Physics & Mathematics. Career After he received his Doctorate, Frost left Cumbria and moved to Hatfield near London and took a research position with the de Havilland Aircraft Corporation investigating the effects of long wave infrared radiation on missiles. His next position was with Canadair in Montreal, first working on the Canadian missile program, then joining their Training and Simulation group, a position that allowed him to travel around the world. After moving to California, Frost became the senior project engineer working on the military F-104 radar systems. Witchcraft According to Frost, he was initiated in 1951 at The Nine Maidens; the stone circle site in Boskednan, Cornwall. His claims to be initiated have, however, never been confirmed, and prominent Wiccan members have repeatedly emphasised that he never was initiated into Wicca. After his claimed initiation, his position with the de Havilland Aircraft Corporation placed him in the vicinity of Salisbury Plain, where he investigated the ancient monoliths of Stonehenge and the people who built them, furthering his interest in ancient peoples and the origins of the Old Religion. While with Canadair, a trip to Chile gave him the opportunity to spend four days in a remote village exploring the religious beliefs and experiencing first-hand the powers of healing as practised by their shamans. While working in California, a trip to Milan, Italy allowed him to do some research into the truths and fiction that surrounds Charles G. Leland‚Äôs Aradia: Gospel of the Witches. In 1966 he relocated to Munich, Germany as a company representative, and became fascinated with the subject of German sorcery. He joined a group of Zauberers (Zauberer ‚Äì German for magician, sorcerer, wizard) operating in der Bayrischen Naehe just south of Munich, became an initiate and qualified to receive and don their Saffron Robe. Even though not Wiccan, The Frosts claimed the title and founded the Church and School of Wicca in 1968, which became the first Federally recognised Wiccan church in 1972. It first operated in Missouri, then in North Carolina, and is now centred in West Virginia. The Frosts stepped down as active leaders of the Church in 1980, but continued to be active as clergy and as heads of the School of Wicca. The Church itself as well as several of their publications have repeatedly been criticised for their rituals which many perceive as inappropriate conduct towards children, resulting in numerous public outcries by initiated Wiccans emphasising that apart from using the name, the Frosts' rituals have little in common with Wiccan rituals and lore.

It is considered analogous or identical to identically named groups among the neighboring Gitksan and Nisga'a nations and also to lineages in the Haida nation. The name Laxsgiik derives from xsgiik, the word for eagle in the Tsimshian, Gitksan, and Nisga'a languages. The chief crest of the Laxsgiik is the Eagle. Beaver and Halibut are also common Laxsgiik crests. Tsimshian, Gitksan, and Nisga'a matrilineal houses belonging to the Laxsgiik tend to belong to one of two groups, the Gwinhuut and the Gitxon. Gwinhuut The Gwinhuut (meaning literally \\"refugees\\") are according to tradition descended from migrations from the Eagle-clan peoples of the Tlingit nation in what is now Alaska. Gwinhuut houses are more numerous than Gitxon ones, and they are related to various Tlingit Eagle groups. All Gitksan Laxsgiik are Gwinhuut, as are most Tsimshian and Nisga'a Laxsgiik houses. Gwinhuut houses include: * House of Ligeex, Gispaxlo'ots tribe, Lax Kw'alaams (Port Simpson) * House of Lutguts'amti, Gitkxaa≈Ça tribe, Kitkatla Gitxon The Gitxon (also spelled Gitxhoon) group mostly claim descent from ancient migrations from the Queen Charlotte Islands, homeland of the Haida nation. Gitxon is popularly etymologized as git (people of) + x (to eat) + hoon (salmon), yielding the meaning \\"salmon eaters.\\" The anthropologist Marius Barbeau, whose writings are the best introduction to Laxsgiik histories, calls this group's ancestral histories \\"the Salmon-Eater tradition.\\" Members of the Gitxon group can be found among the Nisga'a, among the Tsimshian tribes of Kitselas and Gitga'ata, among the Haisla nation at Kitamaat, and at Skidegate on the Queen Charlottes. Gitxon houses frequently are headed by chiefs named Gitxon. At Hartley Bay, where the Gitga'ata live, the group is known as the House of Sinaxeet. Barbeau's now discredited theories about the peopling of the Americas‚Äîhe claimed a far more recent Siberian ancestry for the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshianic-speakers (Tsimshian, Gitksan, and Nisga'a) than is now known to be possible for any Amerindian group‚Äîincluded an assertion that the Gitxon people migrated from Siberia, via the Aleutian Islands and Kodiak Island in Alaska, \\"only a few centuries ago\\" (as he phrased it in the Preface to his Totem Poles). (Barbeau also, controversially and by today's standards erroneously, attributed their adoption of the Eagle crest to the influence of Russian traders' heraldic emblems during the fur trade.) In 1927 in Kincolith, B.C., Barbeau recorded from the Nisga'a \\"Chief Mountain\\" (Sga'niism Sim'oogit, a.k.a. Saga'wan), a story (adaawak in Nisga'a) of the origin of the Gitxon people which records their arrival on the Queen Charlotte Islands, homeland of the Haida, where the Gitxon Eagles came to form one moiety of a village while the people of Qoona formed another. This story tells of Gitxon's niece Dzilakons (variously spelled) and her engagement with a prince of the opposite moiety which led to a war between the two sides, spurring the Gitxon people's migration to the Nisga'a homeland on the Nass River, to the Tsimshian villages of Kitkatla and Kitsumkalum, and to the Cape Fox (in Nisga'a Laxsee'le) tribe of Tlingits in what is now Alaska. Other versions of Gitxon migrations tell of movements from the Charlottes to the Nass, from the Nass to the Charlottes and back again, from Kitsumkalum to the Charlottes and back again, or from Kitselas to Kitamaat to the Charlottes and back again. The Charlottes and Alaska both arise as possible originary points for this group. In 1947, Edmund Patalas (\\"belonging to the Kitamat tribe at Hartley Bay\\") described to the Tsimshian ethnologist William Beynon the origins of the people of the \\"Gitxon\\" group who migrated from the land of the Queen Charlottes first to Kitamaat and then to the Gitga'ata people, where a branch of this group, the House of Sinaxeet, is now considered \\"the royal Eagle house of Kitkata.\\" In 1952, Barbeau recorded a Nass elder's statement that the Gitxons at the Tsimshian village of Hartley Bay were the most numerous, while the Gitxon populations at the Tsimshian villages of Kitsumkalum and Lax Kw'alaams were nearly extinct. The Gitxon people at Kitsumkalum, who are referred to in stories, were not part of the Kitsumkalum tribe by the time Barbeau interviewed Kitsumkalum elders on the subject in the 1920s. The anthropologist James McDonald speculates that the Kitsumkalum Gitxons may have become extinct during the fur trade and that the Kitselas Gitxons borrowed members from the Gispaxlo'ots Laxsgiik to perpetuate their lineage during the 20th century. The Kitselas House of Gitxon and Niisgitloop today is a Kitselas house closely associated with the Kitsumkalum community. In 1924, the Gitxon of the Kitselas tribe was Samuel Wise. Barbeau interviewed him at Port Essington, B.C., in 1924. His version of the migration tells of a journey of Gitxon people from the Charlottes, to Kitamaat, and then up to Kitselas.

The Spanish Inquisition forced de Bry , a Protestant, to flee his native, Spanish-controlled Southern Netherlands. He moved around Europe, starting from the city of Li√®ge in the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge (where he was born and grew up), then to Strasbourg, Antwerp, London and Frankfurt, where he settled. De Bry created a large number of engraved illustrations for his books. Most of his books were based on first-hand observations by explorers, even if De Bry himself, acting as a recorder of information, never visited the Americas. To modern eyes, many of the illustrations seem formal but detailed. Life Theodorus de Bry was born in 1528 in Li√®ge, Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge, now in Belgium, to a family which had escaped the destruction of the city of Dinant in 1466 during the Li√®ge Wars by the Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good and his son Charles the Bold. As a man he trained under his grandfather, Thiry de Bry the Elder (? - 1528), and under his father, Thiry de Bry the Younger (1495‚Äì1590), who were jewellers and engravers, engraving copper plates. The art of copper plate engraving was the technology required at that time for printing images and drawings as part of books. In 1524 Thiry de Bry the Younger married Catherine le Blavier, daughter of Conrad le Blavier de Jemeppe. Their son, Theodore de Bry, also became a jeweller and engraver. Theodore de Bry became a Protestant, and in 1570 was sentenced to perpetual banishment and his goods were confiscated.A. Siret, \\"Bry (Th√©odore de)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 3 (Brussels, 1872), 125‚Äì128. He moved to Strasbourg, along the west bank of the Rhine. In 1577, he moved to Antwerp in the Duchy of Brabant, which was part of the Spanish Netherlands or Southern Netherlands and Low Countries of that time (16th century), where he further developed and used his skills as a copper engraver. Between 1585 and 1588 he lived in London, where he met the geographer Richard Hakluyt and began to collect stories and illustrations of various European explorations, most notably from Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues. Depiction of Spanish atrocities in the New World, as recounted by Bartolom√© de las Casas in Narratio Regionum indicarum per Hispanos Quosdam devastatarum verissima, illustrations designed by Joos van Winghe. In 1588, Theodorus and his family moved permanently to Frankfurt-am-Main, where he became citizen and began to plan his first publications. The most famous one is known as Les Grands Voyages, i.e., \\"The Great Travels\\", or \\"The Discovery of America\\". He also published the largely identical India Orientalis series, as well as many other illustrated works on a wide range of subjects. His books were published in Latin, and were also translated into German, English and French to reach a wider reading public. In 1590 Theodorus de Bry and his sons published a new, illustrated edition of Thomas Harriot's A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia about the first English settlements in North America (in modern-day North Carolina). His illustrations were based on the watercolor paintings of colonist John White. The book sold well, and the next year de Bry published a new one about the first French attempts to colonize Florida: Fort Caroline, founded by Jean Ribault and Ren√© de Laudonni√®re. It featured 43 illustrations based on paintings of Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues, one of the few survivors of Fort Caroline. Jacques de Moyne had planned to publish his account of his expeditions but died 1587. According to de Bry's account, he had bought de Moyne's paintings from his widow in London and used them as a basis for the engravings. Village of Secoton, engraved illustration by de Bry accompanying Thomas Hariot's book of 1588 A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia 220px He and his son John-Theodore made adjustments to both the texts and the illustrations of the original accounts, on the one hand in function of his own understanding of Le Moyne's paintings, and, most importantly, to please potential buyers. The Latin and German editions varied markedly, in accordance with the differences in estimated readership. The verisimilitude of many of de Bry's illustrations is questionable; not least because he never crossed the Atlantic. Amerindians look like Mediterranean Europeans, and illustrations mix different tribal customs and artifacts. In addition to day-to-day life of the American natives, Theodore de Bry even included a few depictions of cannibalism; largely thanks to the accounts of Amerigo Vespucci this was already a very common element in images showing a personification of the Americas. All in all, the vast amount of these illustrations and texts influenced the European perception of the New World, Africa, and Asia. 223px Among other works he engraved a set of twelve plates illustrating the Procession of the Knights of the Garter in 1587, and a set of thirty-four plates illustrating the Procession at the Obsequies of Sir Philip Sidney; plates for Thomas Harriot's Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (Frankfurt, 1590); the plates for the six volumes of Jean- Jacques Boissard's Romanae Urbis Topogrephia et Antiquitates (1597‚Äì1602); and, with Boissard, a series of 100 portraits and biographies of humanists and Protestants entitled Icones Virorum Illustrium (1597‚Äì1599). De Bry had been assisted by his two sons, Johann Theodor de Bry (1561‚Äì1623) and Johann Israel de Bry (1565‚Äì1609), who after their father's death in Frankfurt-am-Main on 27 March 1598, carried on the Collectiones (expanded to voyages in Asia, reaching 30 volumes) and the illustration of Boissard's work and also added to the Icones and other significant publications, like Robert Fludd's works on the microcosm and macrocosm. His work and engravings can today be consulted at many museums around the world, including Li√®ge, his birthplace, and at Brussels in Belgium. In France, they are housed at the Library of the Marine Historical Service at the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes on the outskirt of Paris. In the US, there are copies at the Public Library of New York, at the University of California at Los Angeles, and elsewhere. In Argentina, it is possible to find copies at the Museo Maritimo de Ushuaia in Tierra del Fuego and at the Navy Department of Historic Studies in Buenos Aires. In Scotland, eleven titles are listed in the catalogue of Edinburgh University Library (Special Collections).

The remains include vertebrae, hair and skull pieces. The studies of the body began in 2005. The radiocarbon dating performed at the University of Kiel showed that Moora had died between 764 and 515 B.C. Despite common Iron Age burial practices, the body was not cremated. All of the body parts are estimated to have been found except for one scapula. Before DNA analysis and Radiocarbon Dating, the body was initially believed to be that of a sixteen-year-old girl, Elke Kerll, who had disappeared in 1969 after going to a dance club. Analysis Moora was determined to be between 17 and 19 years old at the time of her death. She was left-handed. It is thought that Moora experienced intense physical labour and likely repeatedly carried heavy loads, like water jugs, while roaming through the marshland. According to Saring Dennis from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Moora sustained at least two partial skull fractures that gradually healed themselves. Moora also suffered long periods of sickness associated with the hardships of long winters. The bone growth lines showed that during her childhood and adolescence, Moora suffered from chronic malnutrition. Moora was also diagnosed to have a benign tumor at the base of her skull, which led to the spine curvature and chronic inflammation in the leg bones. However Moora's cause of death is unknown. It was only determined that Moora was naked at the time she was deposited into the bog. Facial reconstructions Moora's face has been reconstructed four times, two of which were digital. The two that were created in the traditional way had been created by molding material over a plastic replica of the skull. The artist had to estimate the shape of the girl's lips, hair color and skin tones, similar to the process of the Yde Girl. The digital reconstructions were created by Ursula Wittwer-Backofen.

The family name of the Austrian noble von Bressendorfs is Bresselau, Otto is a nickname for Ottone. In the 1980s, Baron Otto von Bressendorf created an investment house that he named Lyons Capital. Lyons Capital attracted entrepreneurs who were looking for capital to start a business or expand their existing business. The company required a finder's fee of $10,000 - 30,000 and claimed a 70% success rate. In fact, according to later FBI indictment, none of the customers received any financing. The company earned about $1 million a year. The Bressendorfs used the money to furnish their house. Some of the businesses went bankrupt and unsuccessfully sued Lyons Capital. In 1993, the Bressendorfs moved to Richmond, Virginia and moved their business there. They also joined the local high society.

The Muslim Parliament consists mainly of appointees, including women and young people, and works through specialist committees. Its proposals have attracted public attention and some have been copied by other Muslim groups. Following Kalim Siddiqui's passing in 1996, the Muslim Parliament's leadership passed to Siddiqui's right-hand man, Dr Ghayasuddin Siddiqui (no relation).Kalim Siddiqui, In Pursuit of the Power of Islam, p.25 The Muslim Institute, London 1996: Muslim Manifesto The ideas in The Muslim Manifesto: A Strategy for SurvivalThe Muslim Manifesto launched the Muslim Parliament. Authored primarily by Kalim Siddiqui, the Manifesto declared: \\"It is a matter of deep regret that the Government, all political parties and the mass media in Britain are now engaged in a relentless campaign to reduce Muslim citizens of this country to the status of a disparaged and oppressed minority. We have no alternative but to resist this insidious campaign.\\" The Muslim Manifesto made it clear that \\"Political and cultural subservience goes against their grain\\" because \\"at its inception Islam created a political platform from which Muslims were to launch themselves on a global role as founders of great states, empires and a world civilization and culture.\\" The Muslim Manifesto proposes setting up a \\"Council of Muslim Women in Britain\\", stating that \\"It is for Muslim women themselves to develop an Islamic lifestyle in the context of the needs of the Muslim community in Britain. It is also for Muslim women to play a major part in the public life of the Muslim community in Britain... The fact is that a Muslim woman cannot be a western woman... Muslim women have a higher and nobler place in society than the so-called \\"emancipated\\" women in the west\\". The Manifesto establishes a six-point \\"Relationship with the British authorities\\": * Islam allows Muslims to accept protection of life, property, and liberty from non-Muslim rulers and their political systems. Muslims placed in this situation may also pay taxes and other dues to a non- Muslim State. * Muslims living under the protection of a non-Muslim State must obey the laws of that State, so long as such obedience does not conflict with their commitment to Islam and the Ummah. Other minorities in Britain, notably Jews and Roman Catholics, do the same. * There are laws on the British Statute Book that are in direct conflict with the laws of Allah; these relate to such matters as usury, abortion, homosexuality, gambling, sale and consumption of alcohol, and the abolition of capital punishment. * Muslims will co-operate with the appropriate authorities for the maintenance of law and order and the promotion of peaceful and wholesome conditions for all our fellow citizens. * Muslims will insist, and continue to insist for as long as it may be necessary, that the British State provide them, their religion and culture protection from gratuitous insult, obscenity and abuse. * Muslims make it clear to the State, and to all sections of British society, that they do not expect to be and will not tolerate being insulted and abused on grounds of their religion, culture and traditions. The Muslim Parliament today The Muslim Parliament today is radically different both in size and aims. It is led by Ghayasuddin Siddiqui and Deputy Leader, Jaffer Clarke. Dr Siddiqui was also a founding trustee of British Muslims for Secular Democracy.www.bmsd.org.uk It is unclear whether the Parliament actually holds regular elections, or has any form of democratic accountability. Dr Siddiqui, as the only voice of the Parliament, regularly used the platform to espouse seemingly moderate views, most recently through the launch of a marriage contract with the stated aim of protecting Muslim women. This is in marked contrast to a previously fundamentalist position. In 2000, the Independent reported Dr Siddiqui's continued support for the instruction for murder placed by the Iranian government on the British Indian author Salman Rushdie.

The Imperial Cancer Research Fund identifies Jim Cowan as having the original idea for the Race for Life. The Fund then engaged Mr. Cowan to organise and act as race director for the first Race for Life event, which took place in 1994 in Battersea Park, London, where 750 participants raised ¬£48,000. The following year, the race was extended to 6 venues and had 4,500 participants with ¬£210,000 raised. It continued to grow year on year to become one of the UK's largest fundraising events, which in 2006 involved 240 races, 750,000 participants and raised ¬£46,000,000. Since Race for Life began in 1994, 6,000,000 women across the UK have raised over ¬£493,000,000 for the charity. Notable participants include: Jane Tomlinson, whose first fundraising event was a Race for Life in 2001 after being diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. She went on to raise over ¬£1,750,000 for charity before her death in 2007.Nico Hines, Jane Tomlinson, charity fundraiser, dies aged 43, The Times, September 4, 2007 In 2009, actresses Laila Morse and Lynda Bellingham became a Race for Life ambassadors in memory of Wendy Richard and Jade Goody, both of whom had recently died from cancer.Race for Life women pay their tributes, The Press and Journal, 3 March 2009 The rules were amended in 2012 to allow boys up to the age of 12 to participate following a determined campaign by Claire Parke. In 2019, Cancer Research UK opened Race for Life to anybody regardless of age and gender. Unfortunately, in 2020, the Race for Life events were postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so instead a new and virtual event was created; it was dubbed Race for Life at Home. Run for Moore Following complaints from John Taylor claiming that the Race for Life was in breach of Section 29 of the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act (which states it is illegal to discriminate in the provision of goods, facilities and services), the Equal Opportunities Commission wrote to Cancer Research UK which then launched the 5 km Run for Moore.http://www.gazetteherald.co.uk/archive/2006/02/16/Ryedale+Archive/6670131.Men_urged_to_run_for_their_rights/ The proceeds from this event only went towards bowel cancer research and campaigns.

A language is homoiconic if a program written in it can be manipulated as data using the language, and thus the program's internal representation can be inferred just by reading the program itself. For example, a Lisp program is written as a regular Lisp list, and can be manipulated by other Lisp code. This property is often summarized by saying that the language treats \\"code as data\\". In a homoiconic language, the primary representation of programs is also a data structure in a primitive type of the language itself. This makes metaprogramming easier than in a language without this property: reflection in the language (examining the program's entities at runtime) depends on a single, homogeneous structure, and it does not have to handle several different structures that would appear in a complex syntax. As noted above, a commonly cited example is Lisp, which was created to allow for easy list manipulations and where the structure is given by S-expressions that take the form of nested lists. Lisp programs are written in the form of lists; the result is that the program can access its own functions and procedures while running, and programmatically alter itself on the fly. Homoiconic languages typically include full support of syntactic macros, allowing the programmer to express transformations of programs in a concise way. Examples are the programming languages Clojure (a contemporary dialect of Lisp), Rebol (also its successor Red), Refal, Prolog, and more recently Julia.  History  The original source is the paper Macro Instruction Extensions of Compiler Languages, according to the early and influential paper TRAC, A Text-Handling Language: Alan Kay used and possibly popularized the term \\"homoiconic\\" through his use of the term in his 1969 PhD thesis:  Uses and advantages  One advantage of homoiconicity is that extending the language with new concepts typically becomes simpler, as data representing code can be passed between the meta and base layer of the program. The abstract syntax tree of a function may be composed and manipulated as a data structure in the meta layer, and then evaluated. It can be much easier to understand how to manipulate the code since it can be more easily understood as simple data (since the format of the language itself is as a data format). A typical demonstration of homoiconicity is the meta-circular evaluator.  Implementation methods  All Von Neumann architecture systems, which includes the vast majority of general purpose computers today, can implicitly be described as homoiconic due to the way that raw machine code executes in memory, the data type being bytes in memory. However, this feature can also be abstracted to the programming language level. Languages such as Lisp and its dialects, such as Scheme,Homoiconic languages (archived), in true Blue blog at Oracle Clojure, Racket employ S-expressions to achieve homoiconicity. Other languages which are considered to be homoiconic include: * CurlHomoiconic Languages * Io * Ioke * Julia * Mathematica * Prolog * Rebol * Red * SNOBOL * Tcl * XSLT * REFAL * Wolfram Language  In Lisp  Lisp uses S-expressions as an external representation for data and code. S-expressions can be read with the primitive Lisp function \`READ\`. \`READ\` returns Lisp data: lists, symbols, numbers, strings. The primitive Lisp function \`EVAL\` uses Lisp code represented as Lisp data, computes side-effects and returns a result. The result will be printed by the primitive function \`PRINT\`, which creates an external S-expression from Lisp data. Lisp data, a list using different data types: (sub)lists, symbols, strings and integer numbers. ((:name \\"john\\" :age 20) (:name \\"mary\\" :age 18) (:name \\"alice\\" :age 22)) Lisp code. The example uses lists, symbols and numbers. (* (sin 1.1) (cos 2.03)) ; in infix: sin(1.1)*cos(2.03) Create above expression with the primitive Lisp function \`LIST\` and set the variable \`EXPRESSION\` to the result (setf expression (list '* (list 'sin 1.1) (list 'cos 2.03)) ) -> (* (SIN 1.1) (COS 2.03)) ; Lisp returns and prints the result (third expression) ; the third element of the expression -> (COS 2.03) Change the \`COS\` term to \`SIN\` (setf (first (third expression)) 'SIN) ; The expression is now (* (SIN 1.1) (SIN 2.03)). Evaluate the expression (eval expression) -> 0.7988834 Print the expression to a string (print-to-string expression) -> \\"(* (SIN 1.1) (SIN 2.03))\\" Read the expression from a string (read-from-string \\"(* (SIN 1.1) (SIN 2.03))\\") -> (* (SIN 1.1) (SIN 2.03)) ; returns a list of lists, numbers and symbols  In Prolog  1 ?- X is 2*5. X = 10. 2 ?- L = (X is 2*5), write_canonical(L). is(_, *(2, 5)) L = (X is 2*5). 3 ?- L = (ten(X):-(X is 2*5)), write_canonical(L). :-(ten(A), is(A, *(2, 5))) L = (ten(X):-X is 2*5). 4 ?- L = (ten(X):-(X is 2*5)), assert(L). L = (ten(X):-X is 2*5). 5 ?- ten(X). X = 10. 6 ?- On line 4 we create a new clause. The operator \`:-\` separates the head and the body of a clause. With \`assert/1*\` we add it to the existing clauses (add it to the \\"database\\"), so we can call it later. In other languages we would call it \\"creating a function during runtime\\". We can also remove clauses from the database with \`abolish/1\`, or \`retract/1\`. * The number after the clause's name is the number of arguments it can take. It is also called arity. We can also query the database to get the body of a clause: 7 ?- clause(ten(X),Y). Y = (X is 2*5). 8 ?- clause(ten(X),Y), Y = (X is Z). Y = (X is 2*5), Z = 2*5. 9 ?- clause(ten(X),Y), call(Y). X = 10, Y = (10 is 2*5). \`call\` is analogous to Lisp's \`eval\` function.  In Rebol  The concept of treating code as data and the manipulation and evaluation thereof can be demonstrated very neatly in Rebol. (Rebol, unlike Lisp, does not require parentheses to separate expressions). The following is an example of code in Rebol (Note that \`>>\` represents the interpreter prompt; spaces between some elements have been added for readability): >> repeat i 3 [ print [ i \\"hello\\" ] ] 1 hello 2 hello 3 hello (\`repeat\` is in fact a built-in function in Rebol and is not a language construct or keyword). By enclosing the code in square brackets, the interpreter does not evaluate it, but merely treats it as a block containing words: [ repeat i 3 [ print [ i \\"hello\\" ] ] ] This block has the type block! and can furthermore be assigned as the value of a word by using what appears to be a syntax for assignment, but is actually understood by the interpreter as a special type (\`set-word!\`) and takes the form of a word followed by a colon: >> block1: [ repeat i 3 [ print [ i \\"hello\\" ] ] ] ;; Assign the value of the block to the word \`block1\`  [repeat i 3 [print [i \\"hello\\" ] >> type? block1 ;; Evaluate the type of the word \`block1\`  block! The block can still be interpreted by using the \`do\` function provided in Rebol (similar to \`eval\` in Lisp). It is possible to interrogate the elements of the block and change their values, thus altering the behavior of the code if it were to be evaluated: >> block1/3 ;; The third element of the block  3 >> block1/3: 5 ;; Set the value of the 3rd element to 5  5 >> probe block1 ;; Show the changed block  [repeat i 5 [print [i \\"hello\\" ] >> do block1 ;; Evaluate the block 1 hello 2 hello 3 hello 4 hello 5 hello  See also  * Cognitive dimensions of notations, design principles for programming languages' syntax * Concatenative programming language * Language-oriented programming * Symbolic programming * Self-modifying code * LISP (programming language), perhaps the most well-known example of a homoiconic language * Metaprogramming, a programming technique for which homoiconicity is very useful * Reification (computer science)  References  External links  * Definition of Homoiconic at the C2 Wiki Category:Programming language topics ","title":"Homoiconicity"},{"id":"4447195","text":"Mohamad Ahansal (born January 1, 1973) is a Moroccan ultramarathon runner best known for his 5 wins of the Marathon des Sables and has taken part in it 19 times.

It is the most northerly village of Dublin, approx 5 km north of Balbriggan and close to the Meath border. Balscaddan is also the name of the townland around the village, and the civil parish of which it is part. The district has a population of under 700 people, and the area around the village is completely rural in character, although close to the expanding Balbriggan. The village is not be confused with Balscaddan Bay which is located on Howth Head and which takes its name from the same source. History Balscadden village is said to derive its name from the Irish Baile na Scad√°n (The Town of the Herrings); this is odd because the village is situated at least two miles from the coast. Local tradition relates that in days gone by herrings were transported inland from a small fishing port, in the townland of Bremore, commonly called Balscadden Bay or \\"Cromwell's harbour.\\" The fish was prepared at Balscadden village for transportation to the Dublin market. Balscaddan was the birthplace of Saint Benignus, who was a disciple of Saint Patrick and eventually became the Archbishop of Armagh in the 5th century. Sport Balscadden FC was formed in 2006 and currently plays in the AUL Division 1. The team plays its home games at the Ringcommon Sports centre and consists of players from the Balscaddan and Balbriggan areas. O'Dwyers GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. Education Balscadden has one mixed primary school, St. Benignus National School, located in the village which caters for approximately 250 pupils. Religion Balscadden is a parish in the Fingal North deanery of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin. The parish church is the Church of the Assumption of Our Lady. The original church in Balscadden was built in 1412. However, it was destroyed by soldiers lead by Oliver Cromwell during his reign of terror. The present church was built in 1819 at a total cost of IR¬£500, as a symbol of the Balscadden community's resilience and determination. Today, its quaint rustic nature makes it a very popular venue for weddings.

He was one of six sons. His mother died while in prison on Robben Island. Early days with Indian National Congress Billy Nair, whose association with Naicker dated from 1950 when he was a branch member of the Seaview, Bellair, Hilary and Umhlatuzana area of the Natal Indian Congress, says that Naicker was a delegate to the Congress of the People and joined the South African Communist Party in 1955/56, i.e. in its illegal period. The party had been banned at the time by the South African government. Incarceration on Robben Island Prior to his arrest in July, 1963 he was employed as a legal clerk at the late G.S. Naidoo's office in Queen Street. While the constitution of the ANC made membership exclusive to Africans, Naicker from his daily work in a legal office knew the mind-boggling quality of the oppression and deprivation visited on African life. Ndabazabantu courts is where you would find Naicker regularly. Long after he went to Robben Island his clients were searching for him not believing that he was in prison. Sunny Singh (ex-Robben Islander) states that he met Naicker of NIC Youth Congress and was a Youth Delegate to the World Youth Festival (in Hungary). In 1964, charged with sabotage and other charges, he was sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. He served his 14-year sentence to the day and returned home to further restrictions and house arrest orders on the 28 February 1978. The imposition of punishment by the courts did not satisfy police officers. They imposed further restrictions on his release, while Archie Gumede employed him on his release. Today many peacetime activists have surfaced, but Naicker through the organisations he worked in challenged the might of the Nationalist party, incurred their wrath and took whatever punishment was meted out. He never capitulated on the Freedom Charter. MK structures outside the country found that a police agent had infiltrated ANC ranks. It as decided to remove Ebi and Naicker from the country in 1980. The only description of Naicker MK had was his very small feet. ANC return of home When African National Congress started to return home in 1990. Naicker was charged with taking care of the assets of the ANC in Lusaka and elsewhere, in a traumatic period, where some tried to personalize the organisation's possessions. He stayed behind. George Naicker was a minuscule fellow weighing at most 50 kg and wearing size 4 shoes. He was unassuming, always in the background, never in leadership roles. On Robben Island, he and Sunny Singh attended to getting the news together. He took part in the celebrations to honour the USSR on the 7 November every year under the noses of the warders. He suffered the extreme pain and indignity of a straitjacket. Naicker died in 1998 in Zimbabwe.

Other Bonapartists consider his son, Jean- Christophe, to be the current head of the house and heir. Family background Charles is the elder son of the late Louis, Prince Napol√©on (1914‚Äì1997), and as such a great-great-grandson in the male line of J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, King of Westphalia, Napol√©on's youngest brother. As neither Napol√©on I nor Napol√©on III of France have surviving legitimate issue in the male line, J√©r√¥me's descendants represent the only Imperial Bonapartes still living (the American Bonapartes were senior in descent from King J√©r√¥me, but the last male of that line died in 1945, nor was this branch ever considered dynastic in France). In 2011, a study of DNA extracted from Napoleon I's beard and compared to that of Charles was found to match substantially, establishing that Charles was a member of the male-line of the Imperial House of Bonaparte (In 2013, published scholarship comparing DNA haplotype evidence taken from Emperor Napoleon I, from Prince Charles and from a descendant of Napoleon's reputed son, Count Alexandre Colonna-Walewski, verified Walewski's descent in the genetic male-line from Napoleon I's patriline, however Walewski's mother was never married to the emperor and he was raised as the legal son of her husband.) Charles's mother is Alix de Foresta (born 4 April 1926), daughter of Alb√©ric, comte de Foresta. Although she was the only consort of the surviving Imperial line not born a princess, her family had been nobles in Lombardy since the 13th century, becoming counts palatine in 1330, constables of Venice in 1425, then retainers of the powerful Doria family in Genoa. They settled in Provence, France early in the 16th century, where they acquired twenty-two manors and the title of marquis by 1651. Ironically, the Forestas distinguished themselves during the French Restoration as courtiers loyal to the House of Bourbon, and to Henri, comte de Chambord in particular. Long established as squires of large estates and rice paddies in the Camargue, the Forestas often welcomed Charles and his siblings there while they were growing up. Charles was born in Boulogne-Billancourt, France, along with his twin sister, Princess Catherine. He was baptised at Saint-Louis-des-Invalides by the Apostolic nuncio to France Archbishop Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII). Charles spent much of his youth at the family's ancestral retreat-in- exile, the Villa Prangins on Lake Geneva between Lausanne and Geneva in Switzerland. He has two younger siblings, Princess Laure (born 1952) and Prince J√©r√¥me (born 1957). His sisters are married but the French imperial line of succession never descended to or through women, while his brother married at the age of 56 and has no issue. Education and profession Charles attended school at Sainte-croix-des-neiges in Abondance, Haute-Savoie, taking off 1964‚Äì1965 to study German in the Black Forest. He holds a doctorate in Economics from the Sorbonne. He has written essays and books, including \\"History of Urban Transportation\\" (Histoire des Transports Urbains, Dunod- Bordas), \\"Bonaparte and Paoli\\" (Bonaparte et Paoli, Plon-Perrin, 2000), \\"The Bonapartes, Rebels at Heart\\" (Les Bonaparte, des esprits rebelles, Plon- Perrin, 2006), and \\"For a New Republic\\" (Pour une nouvelle R√©publique, to be published by Pharos, 2007). He makes frequent public appearances in support of his political beliefs and candidacies. Charles has worked professionally as a banker, financial planner, and real estate developer and as a visiting professor at the American Institute on Foreign Policy. Marriage and children On 19 December 1978, Charles married his distant cousin, Princess B√©atrice of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, daughter of Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Castro, a pretender to the throne of the Two Sicilies. Charles and B√©atrice had two children: * Princess Caroline Napol√©on (born 24 October 1980) married religiously at Neuilly on 27 June 2009 and civilly at Castellabate nel Cilento on 19 September 2009 Eric Alain Marie Qu√©r√©net-Onfroy de Br√©ville (born 28 June 1971), son of Fran√ßois Qu√©r√©net-Onfroy de Br√©ville and his wife Christiane Vincent de Vaugelas:Erede di Napoleone si sposa nel Cilento ** Elvire Qu√©r√©net-Onfroy de Breville (born 8 August 2010), ** Augustin Qu√©r√©net- Onfroy de Breville (born 12 February 2013) * Jean-Christophe, Prince Napol√©on or Prince Imp√©rial (born 11 July 1986), married Countess Olympia von und zu Arco-Zinneberg on 19 October 2019 in Paris. Charles and B√©atrice were divorced on 2 May 1989. On 28 September 1996, Charles was married in a civil ceremony to Jeanne-Fran√ßoise Valliccioni (born in Ortiporio, Corsica on 26 March 1958). She had previously married Erik Langrais on 15 July 1978 at Casaglione, Corsica, from whom she was divorced on 24 July 1990. When Charles and Jeanne- Fran√ßoise wed, they already had a daughter: * Sophie Catherine Napol√©on (born in Paris, 18 April 1992). In 1998, the couple adopted a daughter of Vietnamese extraction: * Anh Napol√©on (born in Ho Chi Minh City on 22 April 1998). Dynastic dispute Although officially recognized as heir apparent to the Bonapartist claim during the lifetime of his father Prince Louis Napol√©on, when the latter's will was made public on 2 December 1997 (seven months after his death), it declared that Prince Charles was to be bypassed as dynastic heir in favour of his only son, Prince Jean-Christophe Napol√©on, then 11 years old. In an interview published by Le Figaro on 2 December 1997, Jean-Marc Varaut, the attorney who witnessed the late Prince Louis Napol√©on's will and subsequently represented the dynastic interests of Prince Jean Christophe against his father, stated that Prince Charles had alienated himself from the Bonaparte legacy by publicly espousing \\"republican and democratic opinions.... He has deprived himself of all rights to dynastic heritage in remarrying without his father's permission... which is against the rules of the imperial family.\\" In his will, Louis cited three sources for his authority to exclude his son as dynastic heir: *The Senatus Consultus of 7 November 1852 (an amendment to the Second Empire constitution): It states, in relevant part, \\"Article 3 Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, if he has no male children, may adopt the legitimate children and descendants in the male line of the brothers of Emperor Napoleon I... his adopted sons may only be called upon to succeed him after his legitimate descendants. Adoption is forbidden to Louis Napoleon's successors and to their descendants.... Article 4 Louis Napoleon Bonaparte shall determine, by an organic decree addressed to the Senate and deposited in its archives, the order of succession to the throne within the Bonaparte family, in case there remains no direct heir, legitimate or adopted.... The members of the family of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte eligible for the succession, and their descendants of both sexes, are members of the Imperial family.... They may not marry without the Emperor's authorization. Their marriage without such authorization entails loss of all rights of succession, both for him who contracts the marriage and his descendants. Nevertheless, if there are no children of the marriage and it is dissolved by death, the prince who contracted the marriage shall recover his succession rights.\\" *The Imperial Family Statute of 21 June 1853: It substantially reinstated the house law adopted under Napoleon I on 30 March 1806, which provided: that marriages of dynasts required the prior, written consent of the emperor de jure, or were void; that divorce was forbidden for members of the Imperial family; and that the emperor de jure retained the right to supervise and discipline members of the dynasty, including (under Title IV) the right to arrest, shun, or banish a dynast who \\"engages in misbehavior and forgets his dignity or duties\\" for up to one year. *Dynastic tradition: Among the Bonapartes this includes legal changes in the succession order during the first and second empires, and post- monarchy attempts to change heirs by testament. Napoleon I quarreled openly with some of his brothers, particularly over their marriages, and dethroned or de-dynasticized them. When Napoleon III's only son, the Prince Imperial Louis Napol√©on, died in 1879, his will purported to exclude his cousin and genealogical heir, Prince Napol√©on Joseph, from headship of the deposed dynasty due to political differences, in favor of his elder son, Prince Victor Napol√©on. Although almost all Bonapartists therefore recognized his son, Napol√©on Joseph insisted that his dynastic claim remained intact. Yet as Imperial pretender he likewise disavowed his heir, writing in his will, \\"I leave nothing to Victor, my elder son. He is a traitor and a rebel.... I recommend to my son Louis to remain faithful to my political and religious opinions. They are in the true tradition of my uncle Napoleon I. I hope that Louis will be the representative of the cause of the Napoleons. His aim must be to organise French democracy.\\" Charles has expressed scepticism that his father's genuine intention was to disinherit him dynastically, \\"Without doubt, he had a mood swing, exploited by conservative elements in his entourage with whom I have long clashed.... I am fighting so that my family ceases to be the victim of attempted manipulation.\\" Moreover, Prince Charles denies that his father had the authority, by law or tradition, to exclude him from the order of succession: > \\"Even if I accept their premise, referring me to the Senatus Consultus of > Napoleon III, divorce did not exist under the Second Empire, so it cannot be > taken into account for the succession.... Moreover, the hypocrisy of this > argument is exposed by the dates: My father's will was written in May 1996. > I only re-married in October. All that matters is the Bonaparte tradition, > which makes the eldest son the natural heir of his father.\\" Aside from his second marriage, Varaut alleged that Louis was offended that his son unilaterally had French civil authorities change their surname from \\"Napol√©on-Bonaparte\\" to \\"Napol√©on\\" during his divorce in 1989. But Charles maintains that the family's legal surname had, in fact, been Napol√©on until altered through clerical error on his birth certificate. When Charles requested that his surname be corrected, the civil authorities proceeded to apply the same change to the father's surname, \\"but not at my initiative.\\" Varaut further drew attention to the fact that Charles was warned in advance by his father that he would be purged from the succession, and that he had responded to his father with a letter dated 16 June 1996 in which he asserted that his \\"republican\\" beliefs had already alienated him from the principles of the Imperial position, even before his father's decision to exclude him. When queried by the French royalty magazine, Point de Vue, as to why he claimed headship of the Imperial dynasty in view of his republican pretensions, Charles replied, \\"I assume the 'moral heritage' of my name. To renounce today to my ability to become the head of our House would imply that I accept a certain number of grievances of which I have been accused...I cannot accept this sentence from another era. As for my republican sentiments, those who reproach me misunderstand the history of our family. Bonaparte ‚Äì General, then First Consul ‚Äì defended the Republic.\\" In fact, the former Heads of the House of Bonaparte, Napoleon I and his nephew Napoleon III had been Republican leaders, respectively, First Consul of the France and President of the French Republic, before they proclaimed themselves monarchs. Charles and his son have not engaged in the public feuding for which some of the past Bonaparte pretenders and their heirs have been notorious, and the father has stated of his son that \\"there will never be conflict between us\\". A pre-screening of Un nom en h√©ritage, a documentary television series on France's former dynasties, was the subject of a two-page spread in a December 2006 issue of Point de Vue that pictured Charles side-by-side with Jean-Christophe, both shown as participating in a cordial meeting between Napoleonic and Orl√©anist pretenders. Nonetheless, in November 2004 an issue of Point de Vue had announced that henceforth the magazine would accord the Bonapartist title of pretence, \\"the Prince Napoleon\\", to Jean-Christophe, whereas since 1997 that title had been attributed to Charles. This decision followed receipt by the magazine of a protest from Jean-Marc Varaut, prompted by publication in an earlier issue of a reference to Charles as \\"head of the Imperial house\\". Point de Vue, which sometimes gazettes monarchist announcements, published Varaut's re-assertion of the dynastic exclusion of Charles along with the prince's response: \\"...the title of 'head of family' among the Bonapartes devolves, at the death of the father, upon his eldest son. That rule is not susceptible to modification by the titleholder, a fortiori when the motives involved are petty and contrary to the Civil Code. I have the honour of bearing this charge since the death of my father, and my son will assume it in turn upon my death.\\" Political career In 2000, Charles stood for election as mayor of Ajaccio, the historical seat of the Bonapartes in Corsica. Subsequently, he served as a member of the Ajaccio City council, and in 2004 he held the post of deputy mayor in that city. In early 2008, Charles announced plans to stand for election in March 2008 as mayor of Nemours, where he leads a union list called \\"Ensemble Pour Les Nemouriens\\" with local personalities, such as Ginette Tardy. In the election, he was defeated by Val√©rie Lacroute.

A pro-rail company, Compass Tours heavily promoted the advantages of rail as a mode of transport, encouraging passengers to leave their cars and take the train. Nearly 300 tours were organised by the company, with many thousands of passenger journeys being taken. The tours were typically very popular, carrying between 400-600 passengers in up to 13 vehicles of Mark 1 or Mark 2F coaching stock. Compass Tours became one of Britain's main rail excursion organisers operating in the North West, West Midlands, North Wales, and Scottish Borders as well as latterly the North East and East Midlands regions, building a loyal customer base. Operating with a regular team of volunteer stewards to operate the Secondary Door Locking system and staff the buffet, Compass Tours had a reputation for friendly operations with focused customer service, efforts recognised with a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence in 2014. The company had a regularly updated website, with PayPal booking system to allow passengers to book their tours online, and a comprehensive guide to each of the tours, information also provided to passengers in an on-board souvenir booklet. History The brand was originally conceived in 2003 by Kevin Melia when he joined with two friends, Shaun and Nick to operate 30 August 2003 \\"The Tayside Liner\\" railtour from Crewe and stations in Cheshire and Lancashire to Stirling and Perth. As the company grew, Kevin's older brother John Melia joined the company in 2006 as General Manager. On 19 December 2014 the final independent Compass Tours charter train ran. It was their 264th trip, although 276 in total had been intended to run - the other 12 having made it through the advertising stages. Only two were ever cancelled because of a shortage of bookings, quite a remarkable achievement. Nine that didn't run were down to planning issues and the remaining one was cancelled on the morning of the tour itself because of multiple issues with the coaching stock which was being provided by Cotswold Rail. A new company targeting the same customer database and with a similar name involving West Coast Railways and a business partner, commenced operations in 2015. A new website was introduced branding forthcoming excursions as Compass by West Coast Railways. The original business ceased to exist, with the founder, Kevin Melia, assisting with the transition of the business into its new ownership before stepping down shortly afterwards. On 3 April 2015 it emerged that forthcoming Compass by West Coast excursions were in doubt due to safety concerns by Network Rail regarding the Safety Management System of West Coast Railways and subsequently, their operating licence was withdrawn. After a return to operation in May 2015, West Coast Railways reduced the prominence of the Compass brand further, with around half of the original year's programme being cancelled during June. With the reputation of the Compass brand reduced, the new owners dropped the Compass brand entirely, rebranding the tours as West Coast Railways operations. Operations=Steam operations In 2011, Compass Tours ran its first steam operations with 5 Mersey Moorlander trips running every Monday during August. This service operated from Crewe via Liverpool to Preston, where the steam engine was attached to run to Carlisle via the Settle & Carlisle line and returning directly to Preston via the West Coast Main Line. Locomotives used for the trips included LMS Black 5 45305, BR Britannia Pacific 70013 Oliver Cromwell and LMS Black 5 45231 The Sherwood Forester. Most of the initial excursions were a notable success, although a cylinder failure on 45321, the locomotive on the final tour, caused a failure at Hellifield on the outward leg. Following on from the success of the initial tours, in 2012 Compass Tours ran a second set of three steam tours, this time to York, under the name of The Roses Express for 3 Wednesdays during April. The tours operated from Southport on 4 April, Barrow-in-Furness on 11 April and finally Hooton on 18 April, of the 3 only the Southport to York trip was steam hauled throughout with the other two having diesel haulage from the start to certain locations where the steam engines were attached. Locomotives used for these trips were LMS Stanier 8F 48151 and LMS Royal Scot 46115 Scots Guardsman. 48151 worked 4 and 18 April tours with 46115 only working 11 April's service from Barrow-in-Furness. The Mersey Moorlander services had a resurgence in 2012, with two dates in July and the remainder being on Mondays during August. Unlike the 2011 services, hauled by a multitude of locomotives, all of the 2012 excursions were hauled by LMS Black 5 45305. In 2013 a number of steam excursions were planned to run. However, the first services were plagued by problems; LMS 8F 48151 failed at Carlisle with the White Rose Moorlander, due to a broken spring. The Yorkshire Coast Express also suffered problems when the same locomotive caused numerous fires on the return trip which resulted in its removal at York. Out of the three further tours that were planned only one went ahead, with LMS Black 5 44932 hauling The Fylde Coast Express from Carlisle to Blackpool North. No steam trips were planned for 2014, however rather quietly it was decided that one portion of the multiday West Highlander was to be steam hauled between Crianlarich and Oban with the locomotive being confirmed as LMS Black 5 45407 The Lancashire Fusilier, unusually with 44871 on the rear providing a hitherto unseen sight of top and tail steam locomotives hauling air-conditioned Mark 2F stock. This was because of a shortage of lightweight diesel locomotives being available for the trip in to Oban, where Route Availability requirements are stringent. They were provided at no extra cost to Compass Tours. In 2015, under new ownership, planned steam haulage returned; locomotives used include LMS Jubilee Class 4-6-0s numbers 45690 Leander and 45699 Galatea.  Rolling stock used  In its 12-year history, Compass Tours never owned any rolling stock but hired in coaches and locomotives from a train operating company or locomotive preservation group as required. In later years it used West Coast Railways, based at Carnforth MPD to provide both locomotives and rolling stock, but also used DB Schenker, Cotswold Rail, FM Rail, Direct Rail Services, Freightliner, Riviera Trains, Class 40 Preservation Group and AC Locomotive Group. The Compass Tours archive shows a full list of previously used locomotives. Social Responsibility & Charity Operations Until cessation of operations at the end of 2014, Compass Tours supported AYME - the Association of Young People with ME through an organised charity raffle and a collection box on-board most of its commercially operated charter services. Over ¬£100,000 was raised for the charity over the 12 years. Additional on board raffles were occasionally used to raise funds for the owning/operating group of the locomotive on the tour (such as Class 40 Preservation Society when tours are hauled by 40145 \\"East Lancashire Railway\\").

The story is about an impertinent red squirrel named Nutkin and his narrow escape from an owl called Old Brown. The book followed Potter's hugely successful The Tale of Peter Rabbit, and was an instant hit. The now-familiar endpapers of the Peter Rabbit series were introduced in the book. Squirrel Nutkin had its origins in a story and picture letter Potter sent Norah Moore, the daughter of her former governess, Annie Carter Moore. The background illustrations were modelled on Derwentwater and St. Herbert's Island in the Lake District. One commentator has likened Squirrel Nutkin's impertinent behaviour to that of the rebellious working-class of Potter's own day, and another commentator has noted the tale's similarities to pourquoi tales and folk tales in its explanations of Squirrel Nutkin's short tail and characteristics of squirrel behaviour. An abbreviated version of the tale appeared as a segment in the 1971 ballet film, The Tales of Beatrix Potter.  Plot  Squirrel Nutkin, his brother Twinkleberry, and their many cousins sail to Owl Island on little rafts they have constructed of twigs. They offer resident owl Old Brown a gift and ask his permission to do their nut- collecting on his island. Nutkin, however, dances about impertinently singing a silly riddle. Old Brown pays no attention to Nutkin, but permits the squirrels to go about their work. Every day for six days, the squirrels offer gifts to Old Brown, and every day as well, Nutkin taunts the owl with another sing-song riddle. Eventually, Nutkin annoys Old Brown once too often. The owl seizes Nutkin and tries to skin him alive. Nutkin escapes, but not without losing most of his tail. After this, he becomes furious when he is asked riddles.  Composition and publication  In 1901, Potter passed her summer holiday at the country estate of Lingholm in the Lake District and from there sent a story and picture letter about a red squirrel colony in Cumberland to Norah Moore, the daughter of her former governess, Annie Moore. She spent the summer sketching squirrels, the landscape around Lingholm, and St Herbert's Island which would eventually become Owl Island in Squirrel Nutkin. Formerly the isolated home of the anchorite monk Herbert of Derwentwater (d. 20 March 687), St Herbert's Island lies in the centre of Derwentwater south of Keswick, Cumbria. Potter sketched and photographed the island from both sides of the lake, from the shores at Lingholm. The island and its surroundings can be accurately identified from Potter's illustrations. Potter photographed Old Brown's gnarled tree and the forest detritus in black and white. The tree stood for many years after Potter's visit. The writer proposed at least three new books to Warne between the summer of 1901 and Christmas 1902. She enjoyed working on two or three-story ideas at the same time, and, in December 1902, privately printed a tale about a poor tailor and the mice in his shop called The Tailor of Gloucester. In November 1902, a month before the private printing of The Tailor, she gave her publisher Norman Warne a version of her squirrel book. He encouraged her to continue the squirrel drawings. In January 1903, she wrote to a former neighbour that she was busy writing a tale about squirrels, and told the grandchildren of Edward Burne-Jones that she was drawing a little squirrel at home. The story was published in August 1903, in a deluxe edition, with a cloth cover, illustrated end-papers, and a print-run of 10,000. Sales were strong and an additional 10,000 were printed the same year.  Critical response  The squirrels set sail on their rafts for Owl Island Scholar M. Daphne Kutzer points out that The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin, like its companion piece, The Tailor of Gloucester, reflects Potter's interest in fairy tales, rhymes, and riddles, and sheds light on her embedded social and political themes. Like The Tailor, the tale is set in a locale dear to Potter's heart. Unlike The Tailor (but more akin to The Tale of Peter Rabbit), Squirrel Nutkin is about rebellion and its consequences. Potter's tale, like many fairy tales, has a rural setting with a threatening figure living at the centre of a wood, and depends a good deal upon repetition: the squirrels arrive on Old Brown's island on six consecutive days, they present an offering of food to the owl on each of those six days, and at each presentation Nutkin taunts Old Brown with a sing-song riddle that suggests the repetitive rhymes or incantations found in fairy tales such as the chant to the mirror in \\"Snow White\\". Potter ends her tale, however, in a very non-traditional way: Nutkin is caught and punished rather than being required to complete a series of tasks or to outwit an antagonist. The author further breaks the traditional fairy tale mould by tacitly inviting her readers to solve the riddles‚Äîa task typically reserved for the fairy tale hero.The solutions to the riddles are embedded in the text following each, gently emphasised in italics. Squirrel Nutkin and Old Brown The squirrels gather nuts for food, and they bring food (dead mice, moles, and minnows among other things) as offerings to Old Brown. The squirrels need the nuts in Old Brown's domain but are in danger of being eaten by him. They bring the old owl foodstuffs to deflect his attention from their presence as potential meals. Issues of class structure and hierarchy play out in Potter's work and Squirrel Nutkin is not exempt: the squirrels lay their offerings at Old Brown's feet and address him with formal politeness to secure his permission to gather nuts. They thus appear as \\"obedient, obsequious servants of a ruler\\". Unlike Peter Rabbit, there are no humans in Squirrel Nutkin but there is still a sense of hierarchy, class, and power, and a desire to overturn it. Old Brown resembles the nineteenth century landowner to whom everything on the land belongs. To take it without permission was to poach and thus to invite severe penalty for poaching was not only a violation of land and property but of sovereignty as well. Similar to Peter Rabbit, the tale began as picture and story letters for real children. Unlike Peter Rabbit's tale however, that of Squirrel Nutkin is a story about a very distinct place: the shores of Derwentwater and its environs. Squirrel Nutkin was embellished not only with Potter's favourite riddles and rhymes, but with a local legend about squirrels appearing on St Herbert's Island. The folk tale is suggested in the secret of squirrel language. The tale differs significantly from Peter Rabbit in that the characters live in their accurately drawn natural habitat. In Squirrel Nutkin, Potter approaches more closely than in any of her other books the kind of natural history writing that was popular in her day in which a story conveyed accurate information about the natural world to young readers. Though the number of riddles were cut during the editorial process, the quality of the writing and the narrative pace nonetheless suffer from the many riddle interruptions of those retained. Potter decided to retain the violent aspects of the characters in her belief that it would be well received by her audience of children.

The mineral's color ranges from cherry red to a dark red to a black. Kermesite is the result of partial oxidation between stibnite (Sb2S3) and other antimony oxides such as valentinite (Sb2O3) or stibiconite (Sb3O6(OH)). Under certain conditions with oxygenated fluids the transformation of all sulfur to oxygen would occur but kermesite occurs when that transformation is halted. Mining and specimens Lustrous, acicular, deep wine-red kermesite crystals, up to 4 cm long, on massive sulfide matrix, from Pezinok, Mal√© Karpaty Mts, Bratislava Region, Slovakia Deposits of this mineral have been found all over the world, however notable deposits have been found in Braunsdorf, near Freiberg, Saxony, Germany; Pernek, Pezinok, and Pribram, Czechoslovakia; the Lac Nicolet mine, South Ham Township, Wolfe County, Quebec, Canada; Sombrerete, Zacatecas, Mexico; Santa Cruz and San Francisco mines, Poopo, Oruro, Bolivia; Que Que, Zimbabwe; Djebel Haminate, Algeria; Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia; Mohave, Kern County, California and Burke, Shoshone County, Idaho.Palache, C., H. Berman, and C. Frondel (1944) Dana's System of Mineralogy, Wiley, 7th ed., v. I, pp. 279‚Äì280 History and uses Kermesite is named after a formerly used red dye, kermes (dye), and was so named because of the grainy reddish color the mineral often has. The name dates from 1832. Earlier in English (17th and 18th centuries) certain antimony compounds were called \\"kermes mineral\\" for the same reason.A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (year 1901). Kermesite or red antimony has been used as early as the Old Kingdom‚Äôs 6th Dynasty in ancient Egypt (c. 2345‚Äì2181 BCE) in lip cosmetics and in the 18th Dynasty Queen Hatshepsut (Maatkare) (1498‚Äì1483 BCE) negotiated with the Land of Punt for its colored antimony deposits. Besides stibnite, which was used for eye liner red, antimony is one of the oldest minerals used in cosmetics. Further archaeological evidence indicates that antimony levels were higher in ancient Egyptian female remains which had exposure to both antimony compounds (Bencze, 1994). Because of its color, the precipitate of kermesite was used as a coloring agent and in alchemy. Because of alchemy‚Äôs focus on material transformation as evidenced by color, red antimony was used to produce the red state. Kermesite is the mineral state for Kermes mineral which was used extensively in the medical field for centuries Presently, kermesite is collected for the beauty of its crystal metallic structure and not used in either cosmetics or the medical field any longer due to the toxic effects that it shares with antimony; less harmful substitutes have been found using both organic and pharmaceutical production.

The band was formed in 1999, upon the meeting of Rodgers and Col. Bruce Hampton at a show at the Variety Playhouse in Atlanta. The group toured for many years as a four-piece with the lineup of Rodgers, Hampton, Greenwell and Pecchio. In the spring of 2006, the band announced they would be touring without Hampton, who was stepping down for a multitude of reasons. The band was aiming to undertake a heavy touring schedule in support of their recent release, in which Hampton was unwilling and unable to participate. He had lent his name to the project for years in order to help Rodgers gain the recognition Hampton felt he deserved, but as a touring musician for 40 years, the grueling demands that a national tour would place on him didn't seem very alluring. Coincidentally, just as this announcement was to be made, Hampton trumped the press release by citing his own health reasons for leaving the band. Since 2006, the group had toured as a \\"power trio\\" first with Rodgers, Greenwell and Pecchio, and from June 2007 on with the latter two replaced by Raudabaugh and Altman, respectively. Raudabaugh and Altman share Rodgers' college-level musical education in jazz and have helped bring Rodgers' vision for his music back to the place where he felt it was best represented. During a show in Savannah, where Rodgers first met Raudabaugh and Altman, the songwriter confidently proclaimed that the sound and vision of his music that he had been searching for had been found. Their music has been described as a mix of jazz, rock, blues, bluegrass and funk with improvised jams being the main theme in their live performances. Some of their unique sound comes from their use of a rotating Leslie cabinet used for Rodgers' guitar. The Codetalkers had a reputation among the jam band crowd for entertaining fans not only with their music, but with their antics on stage. They were also a taper friendly band, who encouraged the taping and trading of their live shows, provided that no money exchanges hands. The band was also known for having guest musicians frequently join them for all or part of a show. Some notable on-stage guests of The Codetalkers have been Jimmy Herring, Derek Trucks, Bob Weir, Mike Gordon, Hubert Sumlin, Ron Holloway and Ike Stubblefield (about whom Rodgers has penned a song bearing his moniker). While primarily playing the bulk of their live performances east of the Mississippi River in the United States, the band also played several music festivals each year, such as Vegoose in 2005 and Bonnaroo in 2002 and 2006. In May 2008, the band played two shows in Tokyo and were invited back for a full-blown tour in early 2009 following the release of their next album. Bobby Lee Rodgers was the primary songwriter, responsible for the original material played by the band, and collaborated on a handful of songs with other band members through the years. He was one of the youngest professors ever to teach at the Berklee College of Music (the world's largest music college,) joining Pat Metheny among those ranks. His background is mostly in the jazz world (he was a professor of jazz studies at Berklee) but played bluegrass as a child (his first instrument was the upright bass, which he picked up at the age of seven.) Rodgers' songwriting and instrumental/vocal skills has led him to great places, most recently as the band-leader for Herring/Rodgers/Sipe, formed with Jimmy Herring (Aquarium Rescue Unit, The Allman Brothers, The Dead, Phil Lesh & Friends & Widespread Panic)) Jeff Sipe (Aquarium Rescue Unit, Phil Lesh & Friends,Mark van Allen (Sugarland, Blueground Undergrass) and Neal Fountain (Fiji Mariners). Herring/Rodgers/Sipe toured in late May and August 2006. The vast majority of the songs played by H/R/S were written by Rodgers. According to his website, Bobby Lee Rodgers officially disbanded The Codetalkers in early 2009, not citing specific reasons; however, Rodgers stated in an interview later that year that the band's demise was related mostly to financial issues created by the management firm responsible for their livelihood at the time.

Hudson automobiles continued to be marketed under the Hudson brand name through the 1957 model year. The first-generation Hudson Hornets featured a functional \\"step-down\\" design with dropped floorpan and a chassis with a lower center of gravity than contemporary vehicles that helped the car handle well ‚Äî a bonus for racing. The Hornet's lower and sleeker look was accentuated by streamlined styling, sometimes called \\"ponton\\" styling. Hornet owner Spencer Blake, writing for Popular Mechanics in 1999, notes that \\"the car's unique, low slung appearance and silky handling earned Hudson an image that ‚Äî for many buyers ‚Äî eclipsed luxury marques like Cadillac.\\" In order for American Motors to build Hudson cars on the newer factory assembly line for Nash Statesman/Ambassador unibody chassis, all second-generation Hudson Hornets became restyled Nash automobiles that were badge engineered as a Hudson. First generation The Hornet, introduced for the 1951 model year, was based on Hudson's \\"step-down\\" design that was first seen in the 1948 model year on the Commodore. Unlike a unibody, the design didn't fully merge the body and chassis frame into a single structure, but the floorpan footwells recessed down, in between the car's chassis rails, which were in turn routed around them ‚Äì instead of a conventional floor, sitting on top of straight ladder frame rails ‚Äì a body on frame design that later became more widely adopted, and known as a perimeter frame. Thus one \\"stepped down\\" into a Hudson. Thanks to the step-down chassis and body, the car's \\"lower center of gravity...was both functional and stylish. The car not only handled well, but treated its six passengers to a sumptuous ride. The low-slung look also had a sleekness about it that was accentuated by the nearly enclosed rear wheels.\\"  1951  1951 Hudson Hornet Convertible Brougham \\"Twin H-Power\\" engine Hudson Hornets were available as a two-door coupe, four-door sedan, a convertible, and a pillarless hardtop coupe. The models were priced the same as Commodore Eight, which was priced from US$2,543 to $3,099. A 1951 Hudson Hornet All Hornets from 1951 to 1953 were powered by Hudson's high-compression straight-six \\"H-145\\" engine. Starting in 1952 an optional \\"twin-H\\" or twin one barrel carburetor setup was available at additional cost. The newly introduced \\"Twin H-Power\\" was available in November 1951 as a Dealer installed option at the cost of $85.60. An electric clock was standard. A L-head (flathead or side-valve) design, at it was the \\"largest [displacement] six-cylinder engine in the world\\" at the time. It had a two-barrel carburetor and produced at 3800 rpm and of torque. In 1954, power was increased to from . The engine was capable of far more power in the hands of precision tuners, including Marshall Teague, who claimed he could get from an AAA- or NASCAR-certified stock Hornet, as well as Hudson engineers who developed \\"severe usage\\" options (thinly disguised racing parts). The combination of the Hudson engine with overall road-ability of the Hornets, plus the fact the cars were over-designed and over-built, made them unbeatable in competition on the dirt and the very few paved tracks of the 1950s. Hudson Hornet 1951 model year production totaled 43,666 units.  1952  1952 Hudson Hornet Club Coupe In 1952 the \\"Twin H-Power\\" version became standard equipment with dual single-barrel carburetors atop a dual-intake manifold, and power rose to . The hood featured a functional scoop that ducts cold air to the carburetors and was considered \\"ventilation\\" in 1954, rather than ram air. The engine could be tuned to produce when equipped with the \\"7-X\\" modifications that Hudson introduced later. During 1952 and 1953 the Hornet received minor cosmetic enhancements, and still closely resembled the Commodore of 1948. The Hornet proved to be nearly invincible in stock-car racing. \\"[D]espite its racing successes...sales began to languish.\\" Hudson's competitors, using separate body-on-frame designs, could change the look of their models on a yearly basis without expensive chassis alterations\\" whereas the Hornet's \\"modern, sophisticated unibody design was expensive to update,\\" so it \\"was essentially locked in\\" and \\"suffered against the planned obsolescence of the Big Three [General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler] automakers. A total of 35,921 Hornets were produced for 1952, with approximately 2,160 hardtops and 360 convertibles.  1953  1953 Hudson Hornet Hollywood Hardtop The 1953 model year brought minor changes to the Hudson Hornet. The front end was modified with a new grille and a non- functional air scoop hood ornament. four different body designs: two-door club coupe, Hollywood hardtop, Convertible Brougham, and a four-door sedan. Hudson Hornet 1953 model year production totaled 27,208 units of which around 910 were the Hollywood hardtops. An 8-tube radio was a $100 option.  1954  1954 Hudson Hornet Sedan Eventually, for the 1954 model year, the model underwent a major square-lined redesign. This entailed extensive retooling because of the way the step-down frame wrapped around the passenger compartment. The front had a simpler grille that complemented the now- functional hood scoop and a new one-piece curved windshield, while the sides gained period-typical fender chrome accents, and the formerly sloped rear end was squared off. The front to rear fender line was styled to make the car look longer and taillamps were also redesigned. The interior was also updated with a new dash and instrument cluster that were surprisingly modern. There was still no V8 engine available, but the six-cylinder was standard in Hornets and produced , the racing-inspired \\"Twin-H-Power\\" (dual carburetor) option was very popular, and a 7-X version of the engine was offered as a factory option, producing over using a high compression head, special camshaft, and other \\"severe usage\\" parts designed for racing. The engine produced high torque at low RPMs and had a fairly flat torque curve, which helped the Hornet beat V8s from other makes whose power advantage came only at much higher RPMs. Although the Hornet's redesign put it on par with its contemporaries in terms of looks and style, it came too late to boost sales. The news that Hudson was in financial difficulties and had been essentially taken over by Nash-Kelvinator to form American Motors Corporation during the 1954 model year was known by the car-buying public. The updated Hornet Brougham convertible, the sole open top body design available from Hudson, was attractive but overpriced at US$3,288 for a six-cylinder car in 1954. Hudson Hornet 1954 model year production totaled 24,833 (the final year of \\"step-down\\" design production, overlapping Hudson's \\"merger\\" with Nash-Kelvinator).  NASCAR fame  Hudson was the first automobile manufacturer to get involved in stock car racing. The Hornet \\"dominated stock car racing in the early-1950s, when stock car racers actually raced stock cars.\\" During 1952, Marshall Teague finished the 1952 AAA season with a 1000-point lead over his closest rival, winning 12 of the 13 scheduled events. Hornets driven by NASCAR aces Herb Thomas, Dick Rathmann, Al Keller, Frank Mundyand, and Tim Flock won 27 NASCAR races driving for the Hudson team. In the AAA racing circuit, Teague drove a stock Hornet that he called the Fabulous Hudson Hornet to 14 wins during the season. This brought the Hornet's season record to 40 wins in 48 events, a winning percentage of 83%. Overall, Hudson won 27 of the 34 NASCAR Grand National races in 1952, followed by 22 wins of 37 in 1953, and capturing 17 of the 37 races in 1954 ‚Äî \\"an incredible accomplishment, especially from a car that had some legitimate luxury credentials.\\" The original Fabulous Hudson Hornet can be found today fully restored in Ypsilanti, Michigan at the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum, a facility that was formerly home to Miller Motors, the last Hudson dealership in the world.  Second generation  In its final three model years, the Hornet became a product of the newly-formed American Motors Corporation (AMC). Following the 1954 merger of the Hudson Motor Car Company and Nash-Kelvinator, Hudson's Detroit manufacturing facility was closed and production of Hudson models was shifted to Nash's Wisconsin factory. No longer built on the \\"Step-down\\" platform, all Hudsons were now based on the senior Nash models, but featuring distinctive Hudson styling themes.  1955  1955 Hudson Hornet Custom Sedan The new models were delayed to a January 1955 introduction, \\"as American Motors engineers work out the problem of making two completely different looking automobiles with identical body shells.\\" The first entirely new car from American Motors, the 1955 Hudson emerged as a conservatively styled car compared to the competition. The 1955 Hornet was the cleanest model with a broad eggcrate grille and distinctive two-toning. Sedan and hardtop body styles were offered, but the coupe and convertible were no longer available. The straight-six engine continued in or versions. For the first time ever, the Hornet could be ordered with a Packard-built V8 engine producing and Packard's Ultramatic automatic transmission. The rear suspension now incorporated a torque tube system for the driveshaft and coil spring rear suspension along with front springs that are twice as long as most other cars. Along with Nash, the new Hudsons had the widest front seats in the industry. The Weather Eye heating and ventilation with an optional air conditioning system were highly rated in terms of efficiency. The integrated placement of major air conditioning systems under the hood and the price of only $395 (about half the cost as on other cars) also won praise. Automotive journalist Floyd Clymer rated the Hudson Hornet as the safest car built in the United States because of (1) the single unit welded body, (2) high quality braking system with added mechanical backup system, (3) roadability, general handling, and maneuverability; as well as (4) excellent acceleration and power for emergency situations. Production for the 1955 model year totaled 10,010 four- door sedans and 3,324 Hollywood two-door hardtops.  1956  1956 Hudson Hornet Custom Four-Door Sedan For the 1956 model year, AMC executives decided to give the Hornet more character and the design for the vehicles was given over to designer Richard Arbib, who provided the Hornet and Wasp with one of the more distinctive looks in the 1950s which he called \\"V-Line Styling\\". Taking the traditional Hudson tri-angle, Arbib applied its \\"V\\" form in every conceivable manner across the interior and exterior of the car. Combined with tri-tone paint combinations, the Hudson's look was unique and immediately noticeable. The legendary straight-six engine, with and without Twin-H Power, was offered and gained for 1956. However, Packard's V8 engine was available only during the first half of 1956. At mid-model year Hornet Special was introduced featuring a lower price and AMC's new V8 engine. The Hornet Special models were built on a shorter and slightly lighter Statesman/Wasp four-door sedan and two-door hardtop platform with Hornet trim. The 1956 design failed to excite buyers and Hudson Hornet sales decreased to 8,152 units, of which 6,512 were four-door sedans and 1,640 Hollywood two-door hardtops.  1957  1957 Hudson Hornet Custom Sedan In 1957, the historic Hudson name came only in a Hornet version in \\"Super\\" and \\"Custom\\" series, and available as a four-door sedan or a two-door \\"Hollywood\\" hardtop. For the second year the V-Line styling featured an enormous egg-crate grille, creases and chrome strips on the sides, and five tri-tone schemes for the Custom models. There was more ornamentation to the cars, including fender \\"finettes\\" atop the rounded rear quarter panels for 1957, as well as very unusual twin-fin trim on top of both front fenders. The price was reduced and the power was increased by way of AMC's new V8 that was rated at with a four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts. Prompted by Automobile Manufacturer Association ban on factory supported racing beginning some time in 1957, production of Hudson Hornet ended on 25 June 1957, at which time the Hudson brand name with its racing heritage was discontinued and all American Motors Corporation automobiles were then marketed as being made by \\"Rambler\\" Division. Total production of 1957 Hornets was 4,108, split between 3,359 sedans and 749 Hollywood Hardtops.American Motors Production Statistics 1955 1956 1957  Foreign markets  The Hudson Hornet was sold in foreign markets, either exported as complete cars or locally-built from knock-down kits. Australia 1955 Hudson Hornet (Australia) Hudson vehicles were locally assembled in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia, from 1913 however World War II put an end to all local vehicle assembly in Australia. Following the war the Australian government legislated currency restrictions which put an end to all local assembly of foreign vehicles. Despite the restrictions Australian distributors were able to bring in limited numbers of US-built, factory right- hand-drive Hudson vehicles from 1946, eventually including the Hudson Hornet. It was not until 1961 that American Motors Corporation vehicles began to be assembled in Australia after AMC struck a deal with Australian Motor Industries in 1960.https://www.australiaforeveryone.com.au/motoring- fifties.html Canada Canadian assembly of Hudson vehicles commenced in 1932 by Hudson Motors of Canada in Tilbury, Ontario. World War II interrupted operations and production ceased in 1941. Post-war operations resumed in 1950, with Hudsons being assembled by CHATCO Steel Products in Tilbury, Ontario. Operations in Tilbury ceased permanently in 1954 following the formation of American Motors Corporation. As a result of the merger, Toronto-based Nash Motors of Canada Ltd. became American Motors (Canada) Ltd. and all subsequent Hudson, Nash and Rambler assembly operations continued in Toronto.

The British company was renamed Hudson Motors Ltd. in 1932. The Hudson Hornet was assembled in right-hand-drive for the U.K market and other European countries. Following the demise of the Hudson marque, the British company was renamed Rambler Motors (A.M.C.) Limited in 1966 and continued to import AMC vehicles through the 1970s.  Legacy  Cars The 1951 Hudson Hornet was selected as the \\"Car of the Year\\" in a book profiling seventy-five years of noteworthy automobiles by automotive journalist Henry Bolles Lent. Some police departments used the Hudson Hornet 4-door sedans as police cars. After their retirement, they were replaced by the AMC Matador and the AMC Ambassador police cars. For the 1970 model year, American Motors resurrected the Hornet name for their new compact car that replaced the Rambler American (see AMC Hornet). In 2006, a small, front-wheel-drive concept car called Hornet was designed and developed by Dodge (see Dodge Hornet). The Disney Pixar film Cars and several spin-off video games featured a Fabulous Hudson Hornet named Doc Hudson, a retired Piston Cup champion. The Piston cup is the film franchise's version of the Winston Cup Series, which changed names several times since its inception. The Hudson Hornet was featured in the video games Driver: San Francisco, Forza Horizon 4, and Forza Motorsport 4 as a part of July Car Pack.

Ewell, was born in the house in 1817, and he went on to become a noted Confederate general during the American Civil War under Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee. The Ewells vacated the home in 1818. A succession of owners had possession of the house over the next 80 years. Halcyon House was sold in 1900 to Albert Clemens, a nephew of Mark Twain. The original structure was heavily altered over the next 38 years as Clemens renovated the house and added structures. Clemens believed that perpetually rebuilding the house would extend his life. The coach house was joined to the building, the north face and rear of the house added onto extensively with apartments, rooms were built within rooms, hallways added and then walled off, and even a small crypt added in one room. After Clemens' death, the house stood unoccupied for four years until purchased by Dorothy W. Sterling, the wife of the U.S. Ambassador to Sweden. Ownership changed again in 1951, and Georgetown University bought the property in 1961 and used it as a dormitory.

For example, interpreting a lambda application may be implemented using function application. Meta-circular evaluation is most prominent in the context of Lisp. A self-interpreter is a meta-circular interpreter where the interpreted language is nearly identical to the host language; the two terms are often used synonymously.  History  The dissertation of Corrado B√∂hmC. B√∂hm, Calculatrices digitales. Du d√©chiffrage des formules logico-math√©matiques par la machine m√™me dans la conception du programme, Ann. Mat. Pura Appl. (4) 37 (1954) 1-51 describes the design of a self-hosting compiler. Due to the difficulty of compiling higher-order functions, many languages were instead defined via interpreters, most prominently Lisp. The term itself was coined by John C. Reynolds, and popularized through its use in the book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.  Self-interpreters  A self- interpreter is a meta-circular interpreter where the host language is also the language being interpreted. A self-interpreter displays a universal function for the language in question, and can be helpful in learning certain aspects of the language. A self-interpreter will provide a circular, vacuous definition of most language constructs and thus provides little insight into the interpreted language's semantics, for example evaluation strategy. Addressing these issues produces the more general notion of a \\"definitional interpreter\\".  Uses  In combination with an existing language implementation, meta-circular interpreters provide a baseline system from which to extend a language, either upwards by adding more features or downwards by compiling away features rather than interpreting them. They are also useful for writing tools that are tightly integrated with the programming language, such as sophisticated debuggers. A language designed with a meta- circular implementation in mind is often more suited for building languages in general, even ones completely different from the host language. Examples Many languages have one or more meta-circular implementations. Here below is a partial list. Some languages with a meta-circular implementation designed from the bottom up, in grouped chronological order: * Lisp, 1958 ** Scheme, 1975 *** Pico, 1997Meta-circular implementation of the Pico programming language *** ActorScript, 2009? ** Clojure, 2007 * Forth, 1968 ** PostScript, 1982 * Prolog, 1972 * TeX, based on virgin TeX, 1978 * Smalltalk, 1980 * Rebol, 1997 ** Red, 2011 * Factor, 2003 Some languages with a meta-circular implementation via third parties: * Java via Jikes RVM, Squawk or Maxine * Scala via Metascala * JavaScript via Narcissus or JS-Interpreter * Oz via Glinda * Python via PyPy * Ruby via Rubinius * Lua via Metalua See also * M-expression * Homoiconicity * Self-hosting compiler ReferencesExternal links * Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP), online version of full book, accessed 2009-01-18. * Metascala Category:Programming language implementation ","title":"Meta-circular evaluator"},{"id":"4447329","text":"Lachendorf (West Low German: Lachend√∂rp) is a municipality in the district of Celle, in Lower Saxony, Germany.

The story is of a little boy named Gossamer Wump (a boy \\"with red hair, one blue eye, one green eye, and freckles all over - even his face\\") who learns to play the triangle to start a musical career. He makes unsuccessful musical attempts at Gaylord Gout's dance club, and then again with Stanislav Hudnut's Orchestra. His rather disastrous debut with the orchestra leaves Gossamer defeated and confused, until a certain man gives Gossamer a very important job - the job of playing the triangle on the ice cream wagon. Gossamer Wump was one of the first children's records to be issued on a 12 inch 78 rpm vinyl disk. The standard format at that time was a 10 inch disk. Dealers of antique records report that Gossamer Wump is one of the most popular collector's items today - one dealer reports that it is in the top three.

History=Early years According to the Russian tradition, each regiment of the imperial guards had its own cathedral. The Trinity Cathedral was the regimental church of the Izmailovsky regiment of Imperial guards, which takes its name from a royal residence in Izmailovo, near Moscow. On July 12, 1733, a large field tent operating as a church was consecrated in St. Petersburg, with icons painted on a dark blue satin. However, the church functioned only in the summer, and in winter the soldiers and officers had to attend other parish churches. In 1754‚Äì1756, a wooden church was built on the site on order of Empress Elizabeth. The church had two altars, the main one of which was consecrated in the name of the Trinity. It suffered heavy damage as a result of the flood of 1824 and had to be rebuilt, a commission given by Emperor Nicholas I to Vasily Stasov. Construction of the present church The Trinity Cathedral in St. Petersburg represents a high point of Russian Neoclassicism The cathedral with Column of Glory in 2011 Construction of the new church began in May 1828, and the cathedral was consecrated in May 1835. The cathedral rises to a height of more than , and dominates the skyline of the surrounding area. Memorial plaques to regimental officers killed in battle were mounted on the cathedral's wall. After the cathedral's opening, flags, keys from forts and other trophies that the regiment won in campaigns in 1854‚Äì1855 and 1877‚Äì1878 were also housed in the cathedral. The Trinity Cathedral was renowned for its collection of icons. The main section of the cathedral housed the Nativity icon, while the southern section housed the Jesus Christ icon. Empress Elizabeth presented the church with the Beginning of Life Trinity icon in 1742. Other holy objects housed in the cathedral included a large ark made in the form of a cross in 1753 from silver, a large silver cross presented to the cathedral by Nicholas I in 1835, and two large Gospels in valuable bindings. Dostoevsky married Anna Snitkina here on 15 February 1867. Post- Revolution In 1922, most of the cathedral's valuables were looted, and the thievery continued for several more years until the cathedral was finally closed in 1938. There were rumors of plans to demolish the cathedral and use the remaining material for a district workers' theatre. However, the cathedral was transferred to the Soviet Ministry of Telecommunications, for which it became a warehouse. Only in 1990 did the cathedral return to the hands of the Russian Orthodox Church, when restoration began. By that time, the interior was largely bare, compared to the splendor and majesty of its pre- Revolutionary past. 2006 fire left Restoration works in April 2008 On August 24, 2006, while the cathedral was under reconstruction, a fire originating on restorers' scaffolding collapsed the main dome, destroyed one of the four smaller domes and severely damaged the interior.

The central dome collapsed and one of four smaller cupolas surrounding it was also destroyed; there were no reports of injuries. Firefighters battled to save the other three cupolas as emergency workers removed icons and other religious articles. A helicopter dumped water on the historic structure. About four hours after the blaze broke out, one of the three remaining cupolas had been damaged but the fire was contained.

A bulky analogue of TACN, is the N,N',N\\"-trimethylated analogue trimethyltriazacyclononane. Illustrative complexes *Although TACN characteristically coordinates to metals in mid- and high oxidation states, e.g. Ni(III), Mn(IV), Mo(III), W(III), exceptions occur. To illustrate, 1,4,7-triazacyclononane reacts readily with Mo(CO)6 and W(CO)6 to produce the respective air-stable tricarbonyl compounds, [(Œ∫3 -TACN)Mo(CO)3] and [(Œ∫3-TACN)W(CO)3]. Both have an oxidation state of zero. After further reacting with 30% H2O2, the products are [(Œ∫3-TACN)MoO3] and [(Œ∫3-TACN)WO3]. Both of these oxo complexes have an oxidation state of 6. The macrocyclic ligand does dissociate in the course of this dramatic change in formal oxidation state of the metal. *The complex, [Œ∫3-TACN)Cu(II)Cl2], a catalyst for hydrolytic cleavage of phosphodiester bonds in DNA, is prepared as follows from TACN trihydrochloride: :TACN¬∑3HCl + CuCl2¬∑3H2O + 3 NaOH ‚Üí [(Œ∫3-TACN)CuCl2] + 6 H2O + 3 NaCl *Mn-TACN complexes catalyze epoxidation of alkenes such as styrene using H2O2 as an oxidant in a carbonate buffered methanol solution at a pH of 8.0.

Description  Texas Banded Gecko (Coleonyx brevis), Webb County Texas, USA (10 June 2016). Texas banded geckos are small, terrestrial lizards, rarely exceeding in length. They have alternating bands of yellow and brown or pink colored banding down their body, generally with black accenting on the bands, and sometimes with varying degrees of black speckling. Hatchlings and juveniles display a banded pattern; the banded pattern gets a more mottled appearance as the gecko becomes an adult.  Distribution  It is found in western Texas and in southeastern New Mexico in the United States, and in Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Durango in Mexico. They prefer semi-arid habitats, and are often found around rock piles or canyon crevices.  Behavior  Primarily nocturnal and carnivorous, they will consume almost any kind of small arthropods. They are capable of vocalizing, and sometimes emit squeaking noises, most often when harassed or handled. Reproduction occurs in the late spring, and they lay one or two eggs, which are surprisingly large compared to the size of the gecko.  In captivity  Texas banded geckos are not frequently found in captivity, but due to their small size and docile nature, they can make good captives. They do not hold any particular conservation status.

Kosovo War and aftermath During the Kosovo War (1998‚Äì99), the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) operated in the region and it was reported that it had killed and wounded several Serbian policemen and civilians. Among KLA attacks against police officers recorded in 1998 in the municipality were: on 16 August in Blace (one badly wounded), on 23 August in Dulje (three badly, four lightly wounded) and in Re≈°tane (one badly wounded), on 25 August in Dulje (one badly wounded), on 28 September in Budakovo (three badly wounded) and in Vraniƒá (one lightly wounded).Members of the Ministry of the Interior - Victims of Albanian Terrorism in 1998, March 10, 1999 KLA shot at an OSCE vehicle driving behind a FR Yugoslav military convoy between Suva Reka and ≈†timlje on 5 November 1998. In 10‚Äì16 January 1999, FR Yugoslav forces conducted counter-insurgency operations in Suva Reka. UNHCR estimated on 18 March 1999 that the Suva Reka municipality had 6,100 displaced and 5,600 returns. On 25 March, the town was surrounded by the Yugoslav army and police, and U.S. documents claim reports of at least 30 Albanians killed. There were reports that Serb forces extorted Albanians in Belanica on 27 March. In April and May 1999, Serb paramilitary repeatedly attacked the villages in the municipality, forcing the population to leave and gather in KLA territory. On 11‚Äì12 June 1999, a Serb family of four was kidnapped in Dvorane and never located.Government of the Republic of Serbia, SPISAK KIDNAPOVANIH I NESTALIH LICA NA KOSOVU I METOHIJI On 12 June 1999, KLA attacked Mu≈°uti≈°te and kidnapped eighteen Serb civilians. After the war, Serbian heritage was destroyed all over Kosovo; the churches (including cemeteries) of Virgin Hodegetria, St. George, Holy Trinity, St. Nicholas and others were completely destroyed in 1999 after the arrival of KFOR (and end of war).

Unlike the well-known duo-rail system, there are many rail-guided transport options which have been described as monorails, so that tracing the history presents a demarcation problem regarding what should be included and what should be omitted. Common usage appears to define a monorail as any rail guided vehicle which does not employ the coning action of conventional adhesion railways to achieve directional stability. This would exclude rack railways and funicular railways. Bearing in mind the pattern of development of conventional railways, different criteria and measures of effectiveness were relevant at different times, and alternative design solutions were proposed. Hence, a monorail of the early 19th Century bears little resemblance to current designs, and were optimised for different performance objectives, within different technological constraints.  Early developments  Palmer's monorail. The Lartigue monorail The earliest patent for a vehicle designed to run on a single rail can be traced to UK patent No 4618 dated 22 November 1821. The inventor was Henry Robinson Palmer, who described it as 'a single line of rail, supported at such height from the ground as to allow the centre of gravity of the carriages to be below the upper surface of the rail'. The vehicles straddled the rail, rather like a pair of pannier baskets on a mule. Propulsion was by horse. A line was built in 1824 in the Deptford Dockyard in London, and in 1825, another line was built in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. Dubbed the Cheshunt Railway, this line made history as it was the world's first passenger-carrying monorail, and the first railway line to open in Hertfordshire. In 1826 a company was formed to construct a line between Barmen and Elberfeld in Germany, but construction never started. Throughout the 19th Century, the Palmer design was improved, with the addition of stabilising wheels and additional rails (rendering a misnomer of 'monorail'). In 1829, Maxwell Dick introduced 'safety rails' below the running rails to reduce the likelihood of derailment. He also articulated the main advantage claimed for this class of vehicle: 'the pillars or supports to be of different heights as circumstances of the country may require'. In other words, the system was better suited for crossing rough terrain. In 1868, William Thorold M.I.C.E. presented a paper proposing a monorail system that could be built at ground level in or alongside roads. The Patiala State Monorail Trainways and Kundala Valley Railway were built in India on the principle that he described. In 1869, J Haddon built a monorail in Syria to replace a mule train in military use. This embodied lateral guide rails, but was basically a pannier design hauled by a locomotive having double vertical steam boilers. General LeRoy Stone demonstrated in 1876 his Centennial Monorail for transporting passengers, but failed to exploit the concept also on the Bradford and Foster Brook Monorail, and this was closed after only one year due to a lethal boiler explosion in 1879. Around 1879, Joseph Stringfellow devised a similar \\"one-rail\\" system for possible use as a \\"cheap railway\\" in Australia.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article1376851?searchTerm=cheap+railway#pstart72945 By the end of the 19th Century, the main protagonists for the monorail where Charles Lartigue and F. B. Behr. Lartigue constructed Palmer monorails in Algeria to transport esparto grass, to replace mules and camels, although the motive power is recorded as 'animal'. He also demonstrated his ideas in Paris (1884), Westminster (1886), Tours (1889), St Petersburg (1894), Long Island (1894) and Brussels (1897). Behr proposed a high speed monorail between Liverpool and Manchester, but construction never started through lack of financial support. The most famous Lartigue monorail was the Listowel and Ballybunion Railway, in Ireland, which stayed in service from 1888 until 1924. Part of this railway survives as a preserved railway and tourist attraction.\\"Unique Irish Trains run On One Rail\\" Popular Science, February 1935 The last Lartigue design was built in 1924 between a magnesium mine at Crystal Hills, about 100 miles north of Los Angeles, and a railhead in Trona, California. This used petrol driven locomotives, and mounted the rail on a set of wooden A frames.  Suspended and bicycle railways  Pelham Park and City Island Railroad, believed to be c. 1910 The Kearney High-Speed Railway In 1886, the Enos Electric Company demonstrated a suspended monorail on the grounds of the Daft Electric Light Company in the Greenville section of Jersey City, New Jersey, which was closer in its appearance to more modern monorails, but the most famous suspended monorail of this era was Eugen Langen's 'Schwebebahn', or floating railway, of Wuppertal, which entered service in 1901, and is still in daily use. The Wuppertal monorail follows the Wupper Valley where a conventional railway is quite impractical. The suspended monorail, like the Palmer monorail appears a potentially superior solution over rough and mountainous terrain, but since the majority of the track is over more favourable territory, it only rarely offers an overall better solution. Short sections in mountainous areas, such as a system built for the Ria Copper Co. by Siemens in the Pyrenees, seem to be the niche for this type of monorail. This particular example used a form of regenerative braking, such that the electricity generated by the full descending trucks was sufficient to drive the empty trucks back up the mountain. In 1890 the Boynton Bicycle Railroad was built in Long Island.Scientific American, 28 March 1891. Designed by Jose Ramon Villalon, who would later become one of Cuba's greatest statesmen, this railroad ran on a single rail at ground level, but with an overhead stabilising rail engaged by a pair of horizontally opposed wheels. The railway operated for only two years, but the design was adopted elsewhere. In 1908, Elfric Wells Chalmers Kearney (1881‚Äì1960)p257 designed a monorail having an overhead stabilizing rail with spring-loaded vertical stabilizing wheels, but although a car was built, it never saw service. From 1910‚Äì1914 a monorail system designed by Howard H Tunis was used on the Pelham Park and City Island Railroad in the Bronx, New York City. On the first trip of the monorail, the vehicle, with the inventor at the controls, slipped off the supporting lower rail. Though some of the New York newspapers erroneously reported that the accident was a major catastrophe, that is not so, and only one passenger on the car claimed a minor injury. The car was quickly repaired and the monorail operated safely on a regular basis from 1911 until 1917, when it was dismantled by the military at the outset of World War I, because the terminal near City Island was requisitioned. A propeller-driven suspended monorail, claiming the speed of aircraft with the safety and reliability of railways was designed by George Bennie in 1926, and named the 'Bennie Railplane'. A demonstrator was built near Glasgow in 1929, but the system did not progress further in the UK. Russia worked on a system similar to the Bennie Railplane in the 1930s and were even planning a 332-mile line through Turkestan with a top speed of 180 mph. Their system was unique in that it had two side by side cars suspended on one rail, and it could actually dismount from the rail to cross rivers as an amphibian and then on the other side remount the rail. And while elements of this system were tested in Moscow, the Russian government instead built a conventional rail system.\\"Twin Amphibian Cars For Monorail\\" Popular Science, July 1934  The gyro monorail  Brennan's Monorail Perhaps the only true monorail was the Gyro Monorail developed independently by Louis Brennan, August Scherl and Pyotr Shilovsky. This was a true single track train which used a gyroscope-based balancing system to remain upright. All were demonstrated by full-scale prototypes, but development was effectively stopped by the First World War. Brennan's design was given serious consideration for the North-West Frontier of India, and a Schilovski monorail was proposed by the USSR government between Leningrad and Tsarskoye Selo in 1921. Funds ran out shortly after construction began. In the early 1930s, New York city considered a monorail system, which would have been the first in the US.\\"America's First Monorail Line Planned For New York\\", November 1930, Popular Science Evolution of 'wheel on steel' monorail The vehicles referenced above (with the exception of the still in full service Wuppertal monorail) are now little more than historical curiosities. The advantage of the monorail of crossing rough mountainous terrain was relevant to the time of expansion of railway networks over virgin country, and in most cases the conventional railway proved the more appropriate solution, except for a few niches. Monorail tracks were rarely longer than 60 miles, and usually considerably shorter. The motor road vehicle finally displaced the monorail from its few niche applications. Wheel on steel characterised monorails of this early era, just as it does conventional railways, although some bicycle railways could react against the stabilizing rail to increase adhesion, improving acceleration, braking and hill climbing.  The modern era: straddling beams  The development of automotive technology has given rise to a new class of monorail which owes little to the work of Palmer and Lartigue. These vehicles are suspended from or straddle concrete beams, and use pneumatic tyres to improve adhesion and reduce noise compared with wheel on steel. They have more in common with guided buses than conventional railways. The beam is less obtrusive than an overhead roadway or railway, and the modern designs may have a niche in dealing with right of way problems in congested city centres, at lower cost compared with tunneling.

Rubinstein, et al (eds.) The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History, Palgrave Macmillan, 2011, p.171 was a British film producer and executive. For over four decades he was one of the most significant figures in the British film industry, particularly in his capacity as head of Anglo-Amalgamated and EMI Films; he helped finance the first Carry On movies and early work of filmmakers such as Ken Loach, John Schlesinger, Alan Parker and David Puttnam. In the early 1970s while head of EMI Films he was called the most powerful man in the British film industry. Early life Cohen was the son of a kosher butcher from the east end of London who was president of the Jubilee Street synagogue. He was the only son with one elder sister. Cohen's parents had emigrated from Poland in the early 1900s and his father was a silent partner in a cinema in the east end. Cohen attended a local LCV school and then joined his father's business. Cinema owner In 1932, Cohen bought a 650-seat cinema, the Savoy, in Teddington. Over three years he built up a circuit of three cinemas in London and four in the regions. One of the cinemas was the Mile End Empire, where Cohen ran talent quests before the movies commenced; among the artists who featured were a young Tommy Trinder and Bernard Delfont. Cohen then turned to distribution, starting with re-releases of the Hal Roach comedies. During World War II, Cohen distributed and exhibited military instruction films in England. His wife and daughter were sent to stay with his friend Sam Goldwyn. Anglo Amalgamated With Stuart Levy he co-founded Cohen and Levy Films in 1945 which eventually became Anglo-Amalgamated. His first film was an ¬£800 documentary called Horse and Country. Cohen produced some films with Dan Angel that were directed by Val Guest, Mystery at the Burlesque (1949) and Miss Pilgrim's Progress (1949). Early features Anglo-Amalgamated began to produce half hour featurettes at a cost of ¬£10,000 then moved into features. Their early films included Ghost Ship (1952), Crow Hollow (1952), and Wide Boy (1952). They started to make films with American stars such as Street of Shadows (1953) which had Cesar Romero. They also had success with comedies such as Glad Tidings (1953). Cohen's first film of note was The Sleeping Tiger (1954), starring Alexis Smith and Dirk Bogarde, and directed by Joseph Losey, an American expatriate making the first of many movies in Britain. Cat Girl (1957) began relationship between Anglo-Amalgamated and American International Pictures. The relationship with AIP resulted in Horrors of the Black Museum (1959), Circus of Horrors (1960), and Konga (1961). Box-office success Cohen had a big box office success with The Tommy Steele Story (1957), one of the most popular movies of the year in Britain. They followed it with The Duke Wore Jeans (1958). Even more popular was Carry On Sergeant (1958), a huge box office success in Britain and very profitable due to its low cost. It led to a series of films: Carry On Nurse (1959) was even more popular, For the company, he produced Peeping Tom and The Criminal (both 1960), the former, now highly regarded, was badly received at the time of its release. He greenlit some of the most important British films of the 1960s, including early feature films directed by John Schlesinger, John Boorman, and Ken Loach.Anglo Amalgamated Productions at Screenonline In 1962 Associated British Picture Corporation bought 50% of Anglo Amalgamated. Cohen became a director of them in 1969. EMI Films Anglo Amalgamated were majority owned by ABPC, who were taken over by EMI Films. Cohen joined the board of EMI and was put in charge of his own independent unit, Anglo-EMI. The actual head of EMI at the time was Bryan Forbes but Cohen had autonomy over his own unit. EMI were going to spend $36 million on 28 films, 13 of which would be from Cohen's Anglo-Amalgamated unit with a budget of ¬£7 million. Cohen: > Right from the start of Bryan Forbes joining the company, there was a sharp > distinction between his films and mine. If Bryan had a cocktail party to > announce his programme, then I had a cocktail party a few weeks later for > mine, too. I had all I needed to keep me at full strength. \\"We now have a great opportunity for British productions by British people\\", said Cohen. Among the films Cohen made for Anglo-EMI included Get Carter, Percy, and several big screen adaptations of popular TV series. On the whole Cohen's movies for EMI outperformed those of Bryan Forbes financially. They were less well received critically, although Cohen's unit was the one that initiated the highly acclaimed The Go-Between (1971). The most powerful man in the British film industry Following the resignation of Forbes, Cohen became overall head of production for EMI. In April 1971 Cohen was appointed managing director of EMI-MGM, a new company formed to make international films. He was also put in charge of Anglo-EMI Film Distributors, Anglo-EMI Films, and Anglo Southern Film Music Publishing. By 1973, the British film industry was in crisis, due to a combination of declining audiences, a weak dollar and lack of overseas investment. Anglo-EMI was the biggest studio operating in the country and was dubbed \\"Britain's one man film industry.\\" Cohen was described as: > The most powerful man in the British film industry and almost the final > arbiter of film taste in this country. No single man in Hollywood at its > zenith held as much power. Nat Cohen not only finances productions but also > distributes and exhibits. One American producer cracked that that he > wouldn't be surprised if Cohen didn't also own the popcorn concessions. That year Cohen estimated he was involved in 70% of films made in Britain that year; other figures put this at 50%. He also claimed that 95% of the films he had been involved with had made money. \\"It's bad for the film industry that I'm the only man making films\\", he said. \\"Because of this I don't really enjoy my power. I need competition and it's important there's competition if the industry is to survive.\\" Cohen however was bullish about the British industry's chances. > I can tell you there are still wonderful opportunities in the film industry, > good and wonderful opportunities... a good film is doing better than ever > before. A lot of people who complain about the industry don't have their > feet on the ground. Look at their track records. They're not very good. The > industry still has life. There's gold in them thar hills I tell you. During this time Cohen commissioned two short films from director Alan Parker who later wrote of Cohen: > Nat Cohen was an avuncular, vulgar man with a shifty, pencil thin moustache > who looked more like a Soho strip club spiv than a film mogul. His lowbrow > taste in film production had secured him a sizeable wallet and hence his > puffed‚Äìup position running EMI. No one could remember any films he‚Äôd made > except that they‚Äôd apparently made a ton of money ‚Äî one of his racehorses > had even won the 1962 Grand National. He drove up and down Wardour Street in > a cream Rolls Royce with a number plate that said Nat 1 (just to rub it in > the noses of all of us snobby and opinionated film industry oiks who were > less than enamored by him) to emphasize just who actually was the smart one. Cohen financed key films in the career of David Putnam, That'll be the Day and Stardust. Puttnam said Cohen would \\"work out what his downside risk was, the most he would lose, so consequently he would never turn down a project that was remotely interesting.\\" He said Cohen would routinely offer to pay part of the budget, meaning producers had to get the rest. Puttnam's then-producing partner Sandy Lieberson later said, \\"He gave us a blank cheque in effect, but always kept the reins on. The man had a real flair for movies and was such an underrated figure in the British film industry in the sixties and seventies, probably the most underrated. He made a tremendous contribution... He backed people. If he liked you, he'd back you.He hated failure, that was one thing he couldn't stand to be associated with.\\" Cohen's best known and most successful film from this period was Murder On the Orient Express (1974), which Cohen said was his idea.Walker 1985 p 129 This enabled Cohen to fund a slate of six new films worth ¬£6 million: Evil Under the Sun (later made in 1982), Aces High Seven Nights in Japan, and Spanish Fly, plus two adaptations of TV shows, The Likely Lads and The Sweeney . Eventually To the Devil, a Daughter was made instead of Evil Under the Sun (which was filmed in 1982). EMI Changes Management In 1976, EMI bought out British Lion and their management wound up running EMI. Michael Deeley and Barry Spikings became managing directors of EMI Films while Cohen became executive chairman. He retired from this position at the end of 1977 to become a consultant. Cohen stayed at EMI for several more years, a period he described as \\"an awkward stage... not quite sure where I was supposed to be; and rarely finding people available when I wanted to consult them. A delicate situation.\\"Walker 1985 p 207 During this time, EMI made some expensive failures including Honky Tonk Freeway and Can't Stop the Music, none of which involved Cohen. \\"I suppose you could sum it up this way\\", he said later, \\"I was very fortunate that as these costly deals were being made, I seemed to be losing control of picture making in the company.\\" Michael Deeley, however, claimed that Cohen committed $1 million of EMI's money for the flop Roar.Michael Deeley Blade Runners, Deer Hunters and Blowing the Bloody Doors Off: My Life in Cult Movies, Pegasus Books 2009, p 142 Deeley said Cohen was \\"quite a different\\" type of executive to him and Spikings. \\"His style was defined by great lies\\", according to Deeley.p 114 Racehorse owner With the success of his film company, Cohen was able to become a racehorse owner. His blue colours with white diamond, hooped sleeves and amber cap were carried to victory by Kilmore in the 1962 Grand National. Findon Village; The Kilmore club Personal life Cohen died in hospital in February 1988 after suffering a heart attack. He was predeceased by a wife and a daughter who both died of cancer; he was survived by another daughter. Appraisal In 1974 a profile of Cohen described him as: > A more urbane version of the one-man-bands who used to boss the studios in > Hollywood's heyday of the movie moguls. An impresario, a bon vivant, a > racehorse owner with many winds in his stable, he applies the lessons of the > turf to the film industry when he affirms that 'there is no such thing as > playing safe' and describes himself as 'a gambler, but an extremely cautious > one. Never reckless. I gamble when the odds are in my favour, not simply on > hunches. I back judgement, not luck. But, ultimately, gamble I've got to... > when the proposition has merit, I put it into effect without delay. I made > the decision on a combination of the project and the individual who brings > it to me.' Another 1971 article called him \\"a natty, cool, watchful man he does not admit to, and has never admitted to a crisis in the British film industry.\\" Cohen said of himself: > Making films is no different from the manufacture of shoes or any other > product... My job is to entertain the public and if I can commercialism and > art, all the better. But I have to remember they have other means of > entertainment and a limited amount of money... Films are a pure gamble and I > always try to bet with the odds in my favour. It's not so much the film one > gambles on as the people making it.

In the face of significant political, geographical, personal and physical hardships, he completed the 24,000 mile flight in 80 flying days, taking 120 days in total. Milton's first major expedition took place in 1968 when he drove a 1937 Austin 7 Ruby across the Sahara Desert to meet his fianc√©e. Milton has won multiple awards as an ultralight (microlight) and hang glider pilot. His interest in microlights grew from a love of hang gliding. He was the Founder of the British National League in 1976, designing a competition format and gathering together the top 54 hang glider pilots in the UK. In October 1978 at Chattanooga, Tennessee, Milton captained the British hang gliding team to victory in the America Cup. The following month he planned another feat: to fly across the English Channel to Paris in one of the first motorized gliders. On 13 November 1978, he was practicing in the prototype over Wiltshire, England. At a height of 250 feet, the wings of the glider collapsed and Milton, unable to open his parachute in time, plummeted to the ground. Miraculously, he survived with severe bruising and some broken bones. The story of Milton's brush with death was covered on the BBC Nine O'Clock News that evening, where newscaster Angela Ripon described Milton as \\"the luckiest man alive.\\" His flight in the Dalgety Flyer (a Shadow 3-axis microlight) in 1987 from London to Sydney in 59 days was, at the time, the longest, fastest microlight flight in history but he is better known for his adventure in 1998 when he made the first circumnavigation of the world in the Global Flyer - a Pegasus Quantum (912) weightshift flexwing ultralight (microlight) trike - travelling 24,000 miles in 120 days, at the time the Guinness World Record for the fastest ultralight or microlight circumnavigation. Chris Bonington devoted a chapter to this feat in his book Quest for Adventure: Remarkable Feats of Exploration and Adventure 1950-2000. Bonnington described Milton's flight around the world as \\"an amazing achievement, of dogged bloody-minded tenacity and the taking of some huge risks..\\" In 2001 Milton attempted to cross the Atlantic non-stop in a Mainair Blade (912) weight shift microlight fitted with a massive 438 litre fuel tank - an adventure that didn't quite go as planned. In 23 May 2009 issue of the UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph, Milton was named as one of the \\"Top 20 great British adventurers\\" still living.

It has been related also to Robin Goodfellow, and Hobgoblins. It is best known for being mentioned by John Milton. The lubberkin is typically described as a large, hairy man with a tail who performs housework in exchange for a saucer of milk and a place in front of the fire. One story claims he is the giant son of a witch and the Devil. The abbey lubber is a minor demon that haunts the wine cellars and kitchens of abbeys, tempting the monks into drunkenness, gluttony and lasciviousness. The best known abbey lubber tale is that of Friar Rush.Briggs, Katharine (1976). An Encyclopedia of Fairies. Pantheon Books. p. 1. . Lubber fiend in literature The lubber fiend appears also in The Red Axe by S.R. Crockett (1900) Lob is the title of a poem by Edward Thomas. It also appears in Lob Lie-By-The-Fire by Juliana H. Ewing, Troll Fell by Katherine Langrish, Abbeychurch by Charlotte M. Yonge and Dear Brutus by J. M. Barrie (as \\"Lob, the ancient Puck\\"). It is also notable that Hellboy fills in some of the credentials of a Lubber Fiend. He was born of a witch and the devil, he has a tail, and he serves men, though not for milk. He can therefore be seen as a modern-day Lubber Fiend. See also * Wirry-cow ReferencesExternal links * Lob Lie-By-The-Fire, by Juliana H. Ewing * The Red Axe, by S. R.

Treadgold (1997). A History of the Byzantine State and Society. Stanford University Press. His orthodox feast is on February 5. History Polyeuctus was raised from being a simple monk to the Patriarchate in 956, as successor to the imperial prince Theophylact Lekapenos, and remained on the patriarchal throne in Constantinople until his death on 16 January 970. For his great mind, zeal for the Faith and power of oratory, he was called a \\"second Chrysostom\\". Although he was given his position by Constantine VII, he did not show much loyalty to him. He began by questioning the legitimacy of Constantine's parents' marriage, and then went as far as to restore the good name of Patriarch Euthymius who had so vigorously opposed that union.Norwich, John Julius. Byzantium, The Apogee. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1992) p. 173. The Russian Princess Saint Olga came to Constantinople in the time of Patriarch Polyeuctus during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, and was baptised there in 957. The Patriarch baptised her, and the Emperor stood godfather. St Polyeuctus prophesied: \\"Blessed art thou among Russian women, for thou bast desired the light and cast away darkness; the sons of Russia will bless thee to the last generation.\\" He raised bishop Petrus of Otranto (958) to the dignity of metropolitan, with the obligation to establish the Greek Rite throughout the province; the Latin Rite was introduced again after the Norman conquest, but the Greek Rite remained in use in several towns of the archdiocese and of its suffragans, until the 16th century (reference needed). Although he had supported his rise to the throne, against the machinations of Joseph Bringas, Polyeuctus excommunicated Nikephoros II for having married Theophano on the grounds that he had been the godfather to one or more of her sons. He had previously refused Nikephoras communion for a whole year for the sin of having contracted a second marriage. Nikephoros' first wife had been dead several years when he married Theophano, but in the religious views prevalent in the Eastern Roman Empire, especially in the 10th Century, remarriage after the death of ones first wife was a sin only begrudgingly tolerated. He excommunicated the assassins of the Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas and refused to crown the new Emperor John I Tzimiskes, nephew of the late Emperor (and one of the assassins) until he punished the assassins and exiled his lover Empress Theophano who allegedly organised her husband's assassination.

It became part of the municipality of S√ºdheide on 1 January 2015. It is about 30 km north-east of Celle and 25 km south-west of Uelzen. It is a station on the railway between Hanover and Hamburg.  History  L√º√üwald, forest near Unterl√º√ü The name L√º√ü was documented in 1569 for a forest, which was probably the source for the name. In 1847, the railroad was built, eventually becoming part of the line between Hanover and Hamburg, and a station Unterl√º√ü was created, causing a settlement around it. In 1899, the company Rheinmetall (then Rheinische Metallwaren- und Maschinenfabrik Aktiengesellschaft) first installed a shooting range and then began manufacturing weapons. The settlement became a municipality in 1910. After World War I, Rheinmetall had to turn to civil production. They managed a model estate ('). Some labourers found work in the Kieselgur industry. During the German re-armament, the production was expanded starting in 1934. Rheinmetall and became nationalised as Rheinmetall-Borsig. Housing for workers was built in Hohenrieth, now also part of S√ºdheide, in 1936. When World War II began, Polish forced labourers were used, and from 1941 also Soviet ones. After the war, Unterl√º√ü was occupied by the British, who confiscated the partly damaged factories. The village housed c. 4,000 forced labourers and prisoners of war in around 20 barracks. Rheinmetall became a private company again in 1951, and another company, Artos, moved to Unterl√º√ü, making machines for textile industry. In 1955, the British left and Rheinmetall began producing for the Bundeswehr. The 150th anniversary of Unterl√º√ü was celebrated in 1997. In 2019, an activist group, SIGMAR 2, blocked Rheinmetall in Unterl√º√ü in protest against the export of weapons to Turkey.

In Mexico El Consejo Nacional de Educaci√≥n de la Medicina Veterinaria y Zootecnia (CONEVET) accredits veterinary medical colleges, although few schools are accredited.Berruecos, J.M.; Trigo, Francisco J.; and Zarco, Luis A. \\"The Accreditation System for Colleges of Veterinary Medicine in Mexico and a Comparison with the AVMA System.\\" Journal of Veterinary Medical Education. Summer 2004. The accreditation system is poor (or nonexistent) in other developing nations; for example, Ethiopia has focused on building veterinary medical colleges rather than accrediting existing schools. Admissions and costs Proportion of students enrolling in each faculty at the University of Sydney from 1900 to 2000. Veterinary students are the thin pink line near the top, indicating the small number of places open to applicants. Admissions practices, requirements and difficulty vary widely among veterinary schools and by country. Admission is generally competitive, due to the small number of places available.Veterinary Medical School Admission Requirements. Indianapolis, Ind.: Purdue University Press, 2008. Most AVMA-accredited institutions in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States share an online application system, known as the Veterinary Medical College Application Service (VMCAS). Many VMCAS colleges also have additional, individualized application requirements, and admissions standards are high.Kogan, L.R. and McConnell, S.L. \\"Gaining Acceptance Into Veterinary School: A Review of Medical and Veterinary Admissions Policies.\\" Journal of Veterinary Medical Education. Winter 2001; Haynes, Emily N. \\"Your Path to Success: Advice to People Considering a Career in Health Sciences.\\" Journal of Veterinary Medical Education. Spring 2007. Admissions standards in Europe, South America, Asia, and Africa also vary widely, with many veterinary schools limiting admission to students from their area, state or country. Twenty-five of the 28 veterinary schools in the US are public universities and, by law, may reserve few places for out-of-state residents. Other countries have similar schemes. In India, federal law requires each veterinary college to reserve 15 percent of its places for students from other parts of India. The Veterinary Council of India (a body of the federal government) conducts the All India Common Entrance Examination, and the top scorers are placed throughout the country.\\"All India Common Entrance Examination (AICEE).\\" Veterinary Council of India.

Veterinary school curricula are not standardized, with programs lasting from three to six years. In the United States and Canada the program is generally four years long, usually after a four-year pre-vet undergraduate degree). For the first three years, students learn anatomy, physiology, histology, neuroanatomy, pharmacology, immunology, bacteriology, virology, pathology, parasitology, toxicology, herd health (also called population health), nutrition, radiography, and epidemiology. During the third year, students learn anesthesiology, diagnostics, surgery, ophthalmology, orthopedics, and dentistry. For the fourth year, often 12 months long instead of nine, students care for a wide range of animals.Turnwald, Grant H.; Sponenberg, D. Phillip ; and Meldrum, J.

The Act makes it treason to \\"endeavour to deprive or hinder any person who shall be the next in succession to the crown for the time being ... from succeeding after the decease of her Majesty (whom God long preserve) to the imperial crown of this realm and the dominions and territories thereunto belonging\\". Originally a capital offence, the penalty was reduced in 1998 to life imprisonment. Although the Act was passed by the English Parliament, it was later extended to Scotland by the Treason Act 1708, following the Union of the two kingdoms in the previous year. The Parliament of Ireland passed a law to the same effect in 1703, the Treason Act (Ireland) 1703 (c.5). This is still in force in Northern Ireland. In fiction * In the movie King Ralph, Ralph used the Treason Act of 1702 as his justification in ordering the arrest of Lord Graves (John Hurt) on the grounds that Graves had interfered with Ralph's succession to the throne. After silently going through the Mnemonic Verse, he mentioned it was passed by William III, when in fact it was passed in the first year of Queen Anne's reign. * In the movie Johnny English, the \\"jumped-up Frenchman\\" Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich) is tried for treason under this Act when his plot to seize the throne is foiled, and the audience is told that the crime still carries a penalty of death by hanging. However, as the film was released in 2003 (the penalty was downgraded to life imprisonment in 1998), it renders the imposition of the death penalty inaccurate.

He made his profession in the abbey of Vend√¥me, 26 August 1673, and after completing his philosophical and theological studies, was sent to the monastery of Bonne-Nouvelle, where he spent the remainder of his life. Biography He died as sub-prior of the monastery. Though somewhat delicate in health, he was a man of great industry and all his leisure was devoted to the study of mathematics and physical and mechanical science. He wrote much, though apparently without thought of publication, for most of his writings were merely transcribed into a large folio volume which was preserved in the library of Bonne-Nouvelle. Alexandre is known chiefly by his two works, Trait du flux et du reflux de la mer and the Trait√© g√©n√©ral des horloges. The former had already been written when the Academy of Bordeaux proposed the cause of the tides as the subject of a prize essay. He submitted an extract which was deemed worthy of the prize and his success led him to publish the entire work at Paris, 1726. This treatise, based as it is upon the supposed rotation of the earth about the moon, is of interest only from an historical point of view, as a contribution to the solution of a problem which has engaged the attention of the most skilful analysts since the time of Newton. The \\"Trait√© g√©n√©ral des horloges\\", Paris, 1734, as its name indicates, is a general treatise on the history and the art of constructing time-pieces. It contains a catalogue of writers on the subject with a brief account of their principal works. Besides his manuscript works on subjects in mathematics, mechanics, etc., Alexandre added a sixth part to Huygens' treatise \\"De horologio oscillatorio\\", in which he describes a clock the length of whose pendulum was automatically varied to enable it to indicate apparent solar instead of mean solar time. A description of the pendulum mechanism, which never came into practical use, may be found in Berthoud's \\"Essai sur l'horlogerie\\", Paris, 1786, I, xvii, where some of its defects are pointed out.

Many of the traditions are practised at the engineering departments of Canadian universities, where student organisations continue to practise traditions started by other engineers in previous years. Calling of an Engineer In the early 1920s, Professor H. E. T. Haultain of the University of Toronto wrote to Rudyard Kipling, who had made reference to the work of engineers in some of his poems and writings. He asked Kipling for his assistance in developing a suitably dignified obligation and ceremony for its undertaking. Kipling was very enthusiastic in his response and shortly produced both an obligation and a ceremony formally entitled \\"The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer.\\" Kipling had long been the literary hero of engineers, having published the poem \\"The Sons of Martha\\" in 1907. In the poem, Kipling identifies engineers with Martha and her children, who continue to do the chores necessary to keep the household running rather than sit at the Lord's feet. Although some later engineers would read Kipling's poem as condemning engineers to being second- class citizens compared to managers, those of Haultain's generation were pleased to take \\"The Sons of Martha\\" as their defining text.The Iron Ring: the Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer - IronRing.ca The Iron Ring The first Iron Ring ceremony was held at the University of Toronto in 1925, with the first rings made of \\"hammered iron\\" that Kipling called \\"cold\\". Although some say the writer used the adjective because the structural material did not forgive the mistakes of engineers working in it, another poem of his puts it in a different and more positive context: :Gold is for the mistress - silver for the maid! :Copper for the craftsman cunning at his trade. :\\"Good!\\" said the Baron, sitting in his hall, :\\"But Iron - Cold Iron - is master of them all!\\" The iron ring's circular shape has been said to symbolize the continuity of the profession and its methods and the circle is also an appropriate symbol of the iterative engineering design process. The original rings were said to have been fabricated from the wreckage of the Qu√©bec Bridge, which collapsed during construction in 1907. Although this is generally thought to be false, the Qu√©bec Bridge is still held as significant. That bridge, whose 1,800 foot main span was to be the largest cantilever structure in the world, collapsed under its own weight because of an error in the design engineer's calculations. The bridge was redesigned, but suffered a second accident in 1916, when its centre span fell while being hoisted into place. Finally, in 1917 the bridge was completed and stood across the St. Lawrence River as a symbolic gateway into Canada. The engineers sometimes regard the bridge as a reminder to Canadian engineers to take care with their designs and to persevere in the face of adversity. Licensing Many engineering students become licensed Professional Engineers after graduation which gives them the right to practise in public. It is usually a structured 4 plus year period of work experience following graduation. Professional status entails both responsibilities as well as privileges, and is not, as some may think, the automatic result of graduation. In every province of Canada and every U.S. state, it is by law mandatory for an Engineer to be registered with the appropriate association before he or she may practise as a Professional Engineer. In Canada, registration as a Professional Engineer is granted only to those whose personal qualifications and professional experience, as well as academic training, can be proven to the satisfaction of their province. This is a matter of law and not choice in order to protect the public. Upon graduation, engineering graduates are permitted to apply for the status as an Engineer-in-Training as the next step in becoming a fully qualified Professional Engineer. By law, only Professional Engineers can call themselves by the name \\"Professional Engineer\\", \\"Mechanical Engineer\\" and \\"Electrical Engineer\\" and their abbreviations. The use of the term \\"Engineer\\" is restricted in Canada if it implies one is a Professional engineer. And the term \\"engineer\\" or engineering\\" can never be used in the title of a business unless approved by the professional licensing body, Professional Engineers Ontario for example. In this case a business requires a \\"certificate of authorization\\" enabling it to advertise and offer engineering services to the public. However, there are occasions where engineer may be loosely used to describe people working in the field of Engineering as Technologists, Technicians and Trades. For example, the Canadian Coast Guard and the Canadian Navy have \\"Marine Engineers\\", \\"Power Engineers\\", and \\"Military Engineers\\" terms only used within the organization, not publicly. \\"Locomotive Engineers\\" have been an integral part of the Canadian railroad industry since its inception. In a related field, accreditation of baccalaureate programs in Computer Science and Management Information Systems are performed by the Canadian Information Processing Society, while Software Engineering can be accreditaded by both CIPS and the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board. Some professionals in the software development field are as certified as Information Systems Professional (ISP) while others prefer to be accredited as a Professional Engineer under the discipline known as Software Engineering. Lady Godiva At numerous engineering departments at Canadian universities, Lady Godiva is considered a mascot, sometimes called the \\"Patron Saint of Engineers\\" or \\"Goddess of Engineering\\", and is the subject of the traditional engineering drinking song \\"Godiva's Hymn\\".The National Engineering Book of Song and Verse - Simon Fraser University The University of Toronto and McMaster University hold annual \\"Godiva Weeks\\". In the past, engineering departments would sponsor a naked woman (or costumed man) to ride a horse across campus. The practice has declined in recent years.Students Scrutinize Lady Godiva Ride - CBC video archive, February 4th, 1990 Pranks Several engineering departments at Canadian university have a tradition of pulling technical pranks or practical jokes. Perhaps most famous amongst these is the hanging of a Volkswagen Beetle shell from the Lions Gate Bridge, as well as other bridges around Vancouver, by engineering students at the University of British Columbia.VW hung off GG Bridge in prank - Jonathan Curiel, San Francisco Chronicle, February 5, 2001 Songs Over the years engineering departments at universities in Canada have come up with various songs, some now obscure but others, such as the Engineers' Hymn, still in frequent use. Purple The color purple plays a significant role in the traditions of engineering schools across Canada. The tradition of purple representing engineering is commonly cited to the story of the sinking of the Titanic, in which the purple-clad Marine Engineers remained on board to delay the ship's sinking, though the legitimacy of this origin is questionable. \\\\- The Engineers Lost Aboard Titanic Purple is also the colour of the Engineering Corp in the British Military. It is common for engineers across schools in Canada to dye themselves (and their leather jackets, in the case of Queen's University engineers) purple using the medical dye Gentian Violet, especially during events such as Frosh Week.

The Ombudsman is responsible for considering complaints by the public that UK Government departments, public authorities and the National Health Service in England have not acted properly or fairly or have provided a poor service. The Ombudsman is appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and is accountable to Parliament. The Ombudsman is independent of both the Government and the civil service and reports annually to both Houses of Parliament. The current Ombudsman is Rob Behrens who has held the post since April 2017. The offices of the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman are at Millbank Tower, London, however the majority of staff are now based in Manchester. History Lieutenant-Colonel Jack Churchill was imprisoned in Sachsenhausen concentration camp and subsequently refused compensation by the Foreign Office. This decision was reversed after a report by the Ombudsman in 1968. The creation of the post of the Parliamentary Ombudsman was spurred on by the 1954 Crichel Down affair and by the activism of pressure groups, including the Society for Individual Freedom. The position was created, and his or her powers are documented in, the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967, the most notable section of which is section 4 and Schedule 2, which constrain the powers of the incumbent ombudsman. Among other things, the ombudsman cannot investigate personnel and commercial actions. The position of HSC was created later, under the Health Service Commissioners Act 1993. The office of the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman emphasises that it looks into complaints \\"that government departments, their agencies and some other public bodies in the UK ‚Äì and the NHS in England ‚Äì have not acted properly or fairly or have provided a poor service.\\" The first UK Ombudsman was Sir Edmund Compton who had previously been the Comptroller and Auditor General. He was succeeded by Sir Alan Marre, a career civil servant. He was the first Ombudsman appointed for the National Health Service and combined that role with that of the Parliamentary Ombudsman as have all his successors. He later became chairman of Age Concern. The post was held by Dame Julie Mellor DBE from January 2012 until July 2016. Process The remit of the Ombudsman was extended in 1973 to cover the National Health Service. In 1996, the Ombudsman was empowered to investigate complaints about clinical judgment. By law, complaints made to the Parliamentary Ombudsman about UK Government departments and other UK public organisations must be referred by a Member of Parliament (MP). This is sometimes referred to as the 'MP filter'. The Ombudsman will only look into complaints if the organisation complained about has been given the opportunity to put things right first. The Ombudsman often receives enquiries which have not yet reached a stage where they can be investigated, usually because the complainant has not completed the complaints procedure of the organisation complained about. Complaints about the NHS in England do not require an MP referral but both complaint processes require that the organisation complained about has had the opportunity to put things right. Powers Lord Young, whose Department was criticised by the Ombudsman over its licensing of the Barlow Clowes group of companies. Barlow Clowes collapsed in 1988 owing ¬£190 million. The Ombudsman may investigate the administrative actions of a Government department or a public authority after a Member of Parliament has referred a complaint by a member of public who claims to have suffered injustice as a result of maladministration. The Ombudsman may investigate maladministration or a failure of service within the National Health Service upon receiving a complaint by anyone who claims to have suffered injustice as a result of that maladministration or service failure. The Ombudsman possesses wide powers of investigation and is able to determine the procedure for the investigation and to obtain information from such people as required. In respect of the gathering of evidence and the examination of witnesses, the Ombudsman has the same authority as the High Court. Defiance of these powers can be treated as contempt of court. If the Ombudsman finds that there has been injustice caused by maladministration or a failure in service, a remedy to put things right can be proposed. This can include an apology, a compensation payment for hardship or injustice and compensation for financial loss. Although the Ombudsman does not possess the power to compel a public authority to adhere to its findings, in practice, the public authority will comply. In 2010‚Äì11, more than 99% of the individual recommendations for remedy made by the Ombudsman were accepted by the body complained about.Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, Annual Report 2010-2011, p15 In rare instances where the body complained about does not accept the Ombudsman's findings, the Ombudsman may lay a report before Parliament explaining that the injustice done to the complainant has not been, or will not likely to be, remedied. In such an event, the Select Committee that oversees the work of the Ombudsman is able to examine the matter and reach its own conclusions. Reports issued by the Ombudsman are susceptible to judicial review by the courts. However, it has been held that the court would not readily interfere with the exercise of the Ombudsman's discretion.R v Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, ex parte Dyer [1994] 1 WLR 621 A Eurostar train near Ashford. In 1995, the Ombudsman investigated complaints made by residents in Kent about how the Government had administered plans for the high-speed rail-link. They alleged that uncertainty caused depreciation in property values. From 19 August 2014 members of the public have been able to search the summaries of investigations that the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman has completed and published on their website. In October 2014 Julie Mellor and Local Government Ombudsman Jane Martin argued for a combined Health and Local Government watchdog, which would be able to instigate investigations as it sees fit, instead of them being triggered by patient complaints. Rob Behrens said in November 2018 after the publication of a favourable report into the organisation by the Republic of Ireland ombudsman that he wanted a change in the law so the Ombudsman could launch investigations without a formal complaint. He wanted it to become a complaints standards authority with regulatory powers over the NHS as is the case in Scotland. The report said the law regulating the office was outdated and out of line with similar organisations in the UK and elsewhere.

On 9 June 1997, Sanders completed a world record motorbike circumnavigation of the world in a record riding time of 31 days 20 hours on a Triumph Daytona. In 2005 Sanders completed a 2nd circumnavigation by motorbike taking 19 days 4 hours on a Yamaha R1. In the summer of 2011, Sanders became the first person to ride from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego and back in under 49 days, 17 hours, a ride he completed on a Yamaha XT1200Z Super T√©n√©r√©. The first leg of the trip was completed in 21 days, just a few hours short of Dick Fisher's record ride and easily outpacing the Guinness World Record of 35 days, currently held by Globebusters' Kevin and Julia Sanders. Sanders normally eschews the dual-sport motorcycles traditionally employed for these type of journeys in favour of Yamaha Motor Company's flagship sport bike, the R1. Sanders has taken groups of riders around the world, as well as Europe and the USA. He has also organised semi competitive road events in the UK. He has made films and written books about his journeys. In 1981 Sanders set the original record for World record for cycling around the World, riding 13,609 miles (21,900 km) around the Northern Hemisphere in 138 days. In 1984 he repeated the world cycling circumnavigation riding about 22,000 km in a time of 79 days. Guinness World Records set the rules in 2003 and did not record Sanders' time as he did not cross antipodal points on the globe Sanders still holds the Guinness World Record for fastest ride around the coast of Great Britain, riding a verified 4,800 miles (7,720 km) in 22 days.

In Sikhism, it implies daily repetition of scriptural texts from the Guru Granth Sahib. Background Paath is the recitation of Gurbani. It can also be called prayers of some instances. It may be done individually or in a group; it can be the recitation of one‚Äôs Banis or any part of the Siri Guru Granth Sahib, alone or with others listening or reciting along. The person reciting Gurbani should pronounce every syllable correctly so that the Naad, the sound current may be produced and affect the consciousness of the one reciting and the one listening. Gurbani may be recited in the Sadh Sangat at any time, whether or not one is in the presence of Siri Guru Granth Sahib. A beautiful form of recitation in a group is to divide into groups of men and women with each reciting an alternate sutra. (A sutra is a complete line of poetry.) In the Gurmukhi each sutra is separated by two vertical lines (//). Gurbani should be recited rhythmically and meditatively. Sikh‚Äôs daily religious regimen Reading of certain banis is part of a Sikh‚Äôs nitnem or daily religious regimen. Paath of these prescribed texts is performed from a handy collection, called gutka (missal or breviary) or from memory. Three of the banis, Guru Nanak‚Äôs Japji and Guru Gobind Singh‚Äôs Jaap Sahib and Amrit Savaiye ‚Äî constitute the Sikhs mandatory morning paath or devotions, and two ‚Äî Rehras and Kirtan Sohila ‚Äî evening paath. Individuals add certain other texts as well such as Sabad patshahi 10, Anand Sahib and Sukhmani. The paath is also performed individually and more particularly in sangat from the Guru Granth Sahib itself. The Holy Volume is ceremonially installed under coverlets on a decorated seat resting on a raised platform, with a canopy above, and is opened by the paathi or reader who sits reverentially behind. Usually, another person stands in attendance, waving the fly-whisk over the Holy Book. The paathi should have bathed and be dressed in clean clothes. Besides the reading of one single hymn to obtain vak or hukamnama (lesson or command for the day) or of some passages, three forms of complete paath of the Guru Granth Sahib are current: Akhand Paath (unbroken recitation completed in forty-eight hours), Saptahik (completed in a week) and Sadharan or Sahij (taken in slow parts with no time-limit for completion). Ati Akhand Paath, hardly ever practised, is when a single participant reads within the prescribed 48 hours the entire text.

It was originally a Jesuit church, and its cornerstone was laid in 1613. It is the only cathedral in Luxembourg. The church is a noteworthy example of late gothic architecture; however, it also has many Renaissance elements and adornments. At the end of the 18th century, the church received the miraculous image of the Maria Consolatrix Afflictorum, the patron saint of both the city and the nation. Around 50 years later, the church was consecrated as the Church of Our Lady and in 1870, it was elevated by Pope Pius IX to the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. At the cemetery of the cathedral is the National Monument to the Resistance and to the Deportation. The centerpiece of the monument is the famous bronze monument by the 20th century Luxembourgish sculptor Lucien Wercollier called The Political Prisoner. The cathedral was expanded and enlarged from 1935 to 1938. History Jesuits from Belgium, which like Luxembourg belonged to the Spanish Netherlands at the time, opened a college in Luxembourg city in 1603, where the majority of young Luxembourgers were taught until 1773. The first stone of the church was laid on 7 May 1613, under Father Fran√ßois Aldenard. The constructor of the building was Ulrich Job, from Lucerne. Under him, the decoration of the columns also took place. The Jesuit church was consecrated and dedicated to the Immaculate Conception on 17 October 1621 by auxiliary bishop Georg von Helfenstein. Artistically, it was above all the German sculptor Daniel Muller (died 1623) from Freiberg (Saxony) who contributed to the appearance of the church, his work including the organ tribune. The decorations in alabaster, a favourite material of Dutch Renaissance sculptors, represent early Baroque angels, who play music between leaves and floral decorations. After the Jesuits had left the city in 1773, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria gifted the church to the City of Luxembourg in 1778, and it became the new parish church under the name \\"Saint Nicolas et Sainte Th√©r√®se\\". This was convenient, as at the time the old parish church, the church of St. Nicholas on the Krautmaart was small and decrepit, and was demolished in 1779. For this reason, a statue of St. Nicholas stands over the cathedral entrance in Rue Notre-Dame. It received the name \\"Notre-Dame\\" on 31 March 1848 under the apostolic vicar Jean-Th√©odore Laurent. His successor, Nicolas Adames, had the Baroque interior refurbished from 1854 in a neo-Gothic style. When Luxembourg was elevated to a bishopric by Pope Pius IX on 27 June 1870, the Notre-Dame Church became Notre-Dame Cathedral. Architecture Though a noteworthy example of late gothic architecture, the cathedral has many Renaissance elements and adornments. 20th century enlargement From 1935 to 1938 the cathedral was enlarged and expanded. This enlargement, which influence the silhouette of the fortress city of Luxembourg, went ahead according to plans by and under the supervision of the Luxembourgish architect Hubert Schumacher. The expanded area, which connects to the two choir bays of 1613‚Äì1621, characterises the image of the former Jesuit church both due to its spaciousness and through the architectural unity. The rebuilding of the exterior architecture on the Gothic-style cathedral presented a challenge, since the goal was to harmoniously integrate the church with the surrounding buildings, such as the former Ath√©n√©e building from the 17th century, the national library, the old church of St. Maximin (1751) (now the Foreign Ministry), as well as the old residential houses. Towers The cathedral has three towers: the west tower, which was the tower of the Jesuit church and which contains the bells, the east tower, and the central tower, which stands over the transept. When the cathedral was enlarged in 1935‚Äì1938, the east and central towers were added. The central tower, which is only a third of the height of the other towers, consists of a wide, pyramid-shaped base and a narrow peak covered with copper. The roof itself is carried by a steel frame, consisting of two PN20 beams from ARBED-Belval. On Good Friday, 5 April 1985, around mid-day, work on the roof caused the west tower to catch fire. The church bells, i.e. the Virgin Mary bell, the Willibrord bell, the Peter bell, and the Cunigunde bell, were destroyed in the fire. When the tower collapsed, the roof of the central aisle was also partly damaged. It took until 17 October 1985 for the tower to be repaired.

In 1678, he returned to England; as a Catholic, he was a trusted servant of James II & VI and went into exile with him after the 1688 Glorious Revolution. He died at the palace of St Germain- en-Laye in March, 1692. Life George Douglas, later the Earl of Dumbarton, was born in 1635, probably at Douglas Castle in Lanarkshire, one of 13 children of the Marquess of Douglas (ca 1589-1660) and his second wife, Lady Mary Gordon (ca 1600-1674). His elder brother was William Douglas, later Duke of Hamilton, while half-brothers from the Marquess' first marriage included Lord James Douglas and Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus. By the 1630s, the vast majority of Scots belonged to the Protestant Church of Scotland or kirk; Catholicism was confined to parts of the aristocracy, such as the Marquess and Lady Mary, and remote Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands. The Covenanter government that ruled Scotland during the 1638-1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms ordered the Douglas children to be brought up as Protestants; to escape this, George was sent to France and he first appears in a safe conduct pass dated 1647 giving him permission to do so.Fraser, vol II, p431 George and most of his immediate family remained Catholic, but his half-brother the Earl of Angus became a Protestant; his elder brother William did the same in order to marry the rich and Presbyterian Anne Hamilton. He married Anne, daughter of George Wheatley and sister of the Duke of Northumberland. They had one surviving son, George Douglas, 2nd Earl of Dumbarton (1687-1749). Career William Douglas, Duke of Hamilton (1634-1694); Dumbarton's elder brother During the Interregnum of 1649‚Äì1660 that followed the execution of Charles I in January 1649, many Royalists lived in exile and joined units in foreign service, like the Dutch Scots Brigade. Such formations were common to all armies, with loyalties often based on religion or personal relationships; Marshall Turenne (1611-1675), considered the greatest general of his time, was a French Protestant who served in the Dutch army from 1625-1635. Battle of the Faubourg St Antoine, 1652; Dumbarton's regiment was part of the Royal Army that won this victory The R√©giment de Douglas was one such unit; formed in 1633 and recruited in Scotland, it had served with the French army ever since. In this period, regiments were the personal property of their Colonel and valuable financial assets; in 1645, ownership passed to the Earl of Angus, who remained in Scotland and assigned the Colonelcy to Dumbarton in 1653. The complex politics of this period meant individuals like Dumbarton needed both political and military skills; during the 1648-1653 Fronde or Civil War in France, as a foreign, Catholic-officered unit, his regiment was one of the few the young Louis XIV could rely on. However, in the latter stages of the 1635-1659 Franco-Spanish War, France allied with the English Commonwealth against Spain. Many exiled Royalists in France, including the future James II, now changed sides and the regiment was assigned to garrison duty to prevent its defection. The duel; a common practice of the period, Dumbarton was so badly injured in one that his death was reported in October 1669 In 1660, Charles II was restored as King of Scotland and England, leading to an attempted coup in January 1661 by Puritan radicals. Dumbarton's troops were sent to England but the revolt was quickly crushed and they returned to France, since the Cavalier Parliament refused to finance replacements for the disbanded New Model Army; this would be an issue throughout Charles' reign. Dumbarton stayed in France until 1678, apart from a short period during the 1664-67 Second Anglo-Dutch War when his unit was based at Chatham dockyard. The diarist Samuel Pepys met him in Rochester and recorded that \\"Here in the streets, I did hear the Scotch march beat by the drums before the soldiers, which is very odde.\\"Diary of Samuel Pepys, 30 June 1667 In 1667, the regiment was accused of looting after the Medway Raid and ordered back to France; while awaiting transport, over 700 of the 1,500 men deserted. In October 1669, Dumbarton was so badly wounded in a duel his death was reported in the newspapers. Battle of Saint-Denis which ended the Franco-Dutch War and Dumbarton's employment by Louis XIV Under the 1670 Treaty of Dover, England agreed an alliance with France against the Dutch Republic, including the supply of 6,000 troops for the French army. It also contained secret provisions which were not revealed until 1771, including the payment to Charles of ¬£230,000 per year for these troops.J. P. Kenyon, The History Men. The Historical Profession in England since the Renaissance. Second Edition (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1993), pp. 67-68. The Brigade fought primarily in the Rhineland, to avoid potential clashes with English and Scots serving with the Dutch; a large part of it was provided by Dumbarton, whose regiment was expanded to 33 companies or 3,432 men. However, the alliance with Catholic France was deeply unpopular and England withdrew from the war after the 1674 Treaty of Westminster. Anxious to keep his French subsidies, Charles encouraged Dumbarton and other members of the Brigade to remain in French service during the 1672-1678 Franco-Dutch War.Glozier, p.154-155. Charles created him Earl of Dumbarton and Lord of Ettrick in 1675 but neither came with estates and Dumbarton complained they simply cost him large amounts of money; in 1677, Louis appointed him Mar√©chal de camp or Lieutenant General in the French Army.Balfour Paul, Vol II, p217 James, ca 1685 as head of the army, wearing a general officer's state coat In 1678, concerns over the Catholic James succeeding Charles resulted in the Popish Plot, in which over 100 people were falsely accused of conspiracy to murder Charles; 22 were executed and this was followed by the 1678-1681 Exclusion Crisis. At the same time, the end of the Franco-Dutch War led to Dumbarton's regiment being discharged from the French army in June 1678; in January 1679, it was reformed and listed on the English military establishment as the 'First Foot.' This was a temporary response to the unsettled political climate and to reduce Parliamentary scrutiny, the regiment was sent to Ireland in 1680, part of it also joining the Tangier Garrison. As a Catholic military professional and long-time servant of Louis XIV, Dumbarton was viewed with great suspicion by the Whigs; he petitioned Charles for compensation for financial losses arising from the 1678 Test Act, which barred him from Colonelcy of his regiment.Glozier, p.179. In reality, nothing changed; the regiment was referred to as 'late Dumbartons' but the Colonelcy left unfilled and he was restored as Colonel in 1685. Lacking a standing army, mercenary units like Dumbartons were a means of creating a pool of trained English and Scottish professionals; the most significant of these was the Dutch Scots Brigade, a mixture of English and Scottish regiments serving William of Orange. While Charles theoretically controlled the appointment of officers, in reality it required negotiation and attempts to appoint Dumbarton as Brigade commander in 1680 were rejected by William.Glozier, p.192. Earl of Melfort, leader of the Scottish Court Party, which included Dumbarton James was sent to Edinburgh in 1681 as Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland; over the next two years, he established a Scottish Court Party, a mixture of Catholics like the Earl of Melfort and Dumbarton, plus supportive Protestants such as his brother, the Duke of Hamilton.Glozier, p.195. In August 1681, the Scottish Parliament passed the Succession Act, which confirmed the divine right of kings, the rights of the natural heir 'regardless of religion,' the duty of all to swear allegiance to that king and the independence of the Scottish Crown. However, tolerance for personal Catholicism did not extend to Catholicism in general; the 1681 Scottish Test Act also required all public officials and MPs to swear unconditional loyalty to the King but with the crucial qualifier they 'promise to uphold the true Protestant religion.' In 1683, rumours spread that Dumbarton was about to replace the Protestant Tam Dalyell as Commander of Chief in Scotland, which may explain why he was asked to lead a diplomatic mission to France in July.Glozier, p.197. In 1684, Charles paid him ¬£1,500 in compensation for losses incurred as a result of his Catholicism. James became king in February 1685 and in June, Dumbarton helped put down Argyll's Rising; he served briefly as Commander-in-Chief, Scotland but was replaced in October by the Presbyterian William Drummond, Viscount Strathallan. However, in return for his support, he received the forfeited estates of Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun; in 1687, he was a founder member of the Order of the Thistle, along with his nephew the Earl of Arran. After James was deposed in the November 1688 Glorious Revolution, Dumbarton accompanied him into exile in France and died at St Germain-en-Laye in March 1692; he was buried at the Abbey of Saint- Germain-des-Pr√©s, amongst other members of his family.

Geography Winsen has around 12,900 inhabitants and lies on the southern perimeter of the L√ºneburg Heath, on the banks of the Aller, somewhat to the west of its tributary, the √ñrtze and about 15 km northwest of Celle. As well as the town itself, the borough of Winsen also includes the villages of Bannetze, Mei√üendorf, Stedden, S√ºdwinsen, Th√∂ren, Walle and Wolthausen. History The name of the town is derived from Wynhausen (Wyn = Weideland or meadow). Winsen's church is dedicated to John the Baptist. Because all villages with churches named after this patron saint appeared around 800 it is suspected that this was also when Winsen was founded. Today Winsen is a favourite local recreation and holiday area and, since 1975, has been recognised officially as a climatic health resort (Luftkurort). Politics=Coat of Arms The coat of arms of the town depicts the Stechinelli Gate, one of the town‚Äôs monuments and, in between the two gateposts, the coat of arms of L√ºneburg, a gold shield with red hearts surrounding a blue lion rampant. Culture and places of interest The Fachhallenhaus, ', in the Winsen Museum Farm * The nature and bird reserve of Mei√üendorf Lakes and Bannetzer Moor is the largest stretch of water on the L√ºneburg Heath covering a total area of including of water. * The Winsen Museum Farm (Museumshof Winsen) portrays a rural farmstead from the S√ºdheide heath with buildings from the 17th ‚Äì 19th century as well as ', a 1795 Low German house or Fachhallenhaus, today the cultural centrepiece of the community. * The earliest record of the Winsen mills is from 1589. The present-day post mill (Bockwindm√ºhle) was built in 1732 and worked until it closed in 1929. It came into the possession of the town in 1938. * The church, like the town itself, is presumed to have emerged during the missionary period in Saxony during the 9th century. The Church of St. John the Baptist was built in the 14th century as a Gothic long house, that was extended on its north side in 1597. In 1822 a major expansion of the church building began, which effectively became a new building. * The Junker Gate (Junkerntor) is one of the oldest still preserved historic buildings in Winsen. It used to be the entrance to the manor house (Rittergut). From 1691 to 1729 the Stechinelli family was enfeoffed with the estate, which is why it is also called the Stechinelli Gate and why the family coat of arms appears on the left hand gate column. The gate itself forms part of Winsen‚Äôs coat of arms. * The Prince‚Äôs Stones (Prinzensteine) lie by a track between Winsen and Oldau and recall a decisive battle on 28 May 1388 during the L√ºneburg War of Succession (L√ºneburger Erbfolgekrieg). According to legend two princes wounded each other mortally at this spot before they realised they were brothers. * The present- day town hall (Rathaus) was initially built in 1727 as a district office (Amtshaus) but had to be torn down again as the underlying ground was not sufficiently secure. It was then rebuilt in the baroque style. On 4 May 1972 the former district office, which meanwhile had been used as a pub, was given its new purpose as a town hall.

It is a highly variable mushroom (hence ‚Äúdeceiver‚Äù), and can look quite washed out, colorless and drab, but when younger it often assumes red, pinkish brown, and orange tones. The species is often considered by mushroom collectors to be a ‚Äúmushroom weed‚Äù because of its abundance and plain stature.  Taxonomy  The deceiver was first described by Tyrolian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1772 as Agaricus laccatus, before being given its current binomial name by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in 1884. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin adjective laccatus ‚Äúvarnished‚Äù or ‚Äúshining‚Äù. Clitocybe laccata is an old alternative name. Var. pallidifolia, described by Charles Horton Peck, is the most common variety found in North America. It is the type species of the cosmopolitan mushroom genus Laccaria; where their relations lie among the gilled mushrooms is unclear, but they are currently classified in the family Hydnangiaceae. The deceiver gets its common name from its variable appearance. Other names include lacklustre laccaria, and, by the Zapotec people, Beshia ladhi biinii (also the name of other members of Laccaria).  Description  The deceiver is a small mushroom with a cap up to in diameter, convex when young and later flattening or even depressed in the center. It can be various shades of salmon pink, brick-red, or shades of orange or brown when moist or young, and duller and paler when dry. The fibrous stipe is high and wide. The irregular gills are widely spaced and decurrent or adnexed, and of similar color to the cap, though whiten with spores as the mushroom matures. The spore print is white, and the round spiny spores are 7‚Äì10 Œºm in diameter. The flesh is thin and has little taste. Formerly considered a subspecies by French mycologist Ren√© Maire, the close deceiver (Laccaria proxima) is a European relative with a fine scaly cap and found in wetter habitats. Microscopically, its spores are narrower and more oval-shaped. In California, what was thought to be L. laccata under eucalyptus has turned out to be the Australian species Laccaria fraterna.http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Laccaria_fraterna.html File:Laccaria laccata G4 (3).JPGCap File:Laccaria laccata (4501591685).jpgCap File:Laccaria laccata G4 (1).JPGGills and stipe File:Waxy Laccaria - Laccaria laccata (29119117746).jpg Gills File:Illustrations of British Fungi (Hymenomycetes), to serve as an atlas to the \\"Handbook of British Fungi\\" (Pl. 139) (6055652565).jpg L. laccata as Agaricus laccatus in Illustrations of British Fungi (Hymenomycetes), to serve as an atlas to the \\"Handbook of British Fungi\\".  Distribution and habitat  Laccaria laccata is found in scattered troops in wooded areas, and on heathland often in poor soil. It is very common in all of the northern temperate zones, but tends to favor cool weather. L. laccata is mycorrhizal with several types of trees, including members of the Pinaceae (Pines), Fagaceae (Beech), and Betulaceae (Birch). It is found across Europe and North America, south into Mexico and Costa Rica. Laccaria species are mycorrhizal, and thought by some to be pioneer species.  Edibility  Although small, the deceiver is edible and mild-tasting. It is one of many mushrooms traditionally eaten by the Zapotec people of Oaxaca in Mexico. However, it is important to distinguish it from potentially lethal small brown mushrooms.

In February 2007 RpK renegotiated its COTS agreement, agreeing to raise the $500 million of required private financing before the end of May. By August 2007, RpK had failed to obtain that financing, forcing them to cut their workforce.

After school he joined Gala RFC and played for the 2XV at lock. He soon moved to loose-head prop and over the next fifteen years made the position his own. Early in his career he gained a reputation for rumbustious play. Bill McLaren described him as \\"a tough rugged son of the soil\\".

He is a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 17 in Montgomery County, which includes the cities of Rockville and Gaithersburg. He was the first Asian-American, of Indian descent, to be elected to a state legislature in the United States, and served from 2002 to 2015 as the Majority Leader of the House of Delegates. In 2015, he was appointed to chair the House Environment and Transportation Committee, which oversees transportion, the environment, agriculture, ethics, and housing and real property law. His legislative work has focused largely on protecting the environment, improving health care, and the promotion of the high-tech industry in Maryland. He sponsored both the 1995 Health Access Act that place limits on HMOs for the first time and legislation that created the Technology Development Corporation of Maryland. He unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2016 in Maryland's 8th congressional district, losing the Democratic Primary to the eventual winner, State Senator Jamie Raskin. Personal life Barve was born on September 8, 1958 in Schenectady, New York to Indian-American parents. The family later moved to Maryland, where he attended Paint Branch High School in Silver Spring. In 1980, Barve graduated from Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business with a B.S. degree in Accounting. Legislative career Barve was first elected to the House of Delegates in 1990, finishing third in the contest for District 17's three seats behind incumbents Jennie M. Forehand and Mike Gordon but ahead of four other challengers. As a result of his victory, Barve became the first Indian- American to serve in a state legislature. He took office in January, 1991, and was appointed to the House Economic Matters Committee, which considers legislation related to business and labor policy and regulation. After his first re-election in 1994, Barve rose in leadership with his appointment as chair of a subcommittee, first the Real Property subcommittee in 1995 and 1996, and later the Science and Technology Subcommittee from 1997 to 2003. Also in 1995, he was elected to chair the Montgomery County Delegation to Annapolis. Barve was re-elected in 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010. Following the election of a new Speaker, Michael E. Busch, in 2003, Barve was appointed to serve as majority leader, the leader of the Democratic majority and second in command to the Speaker. He served for two years on the Environmental Matters Committee before moving again to the Ways and Means Committee, where he oversaw tax policy as Chair of the Revenues Subcommittee from 2007 to 2010. In additional, he serves on a number of major joint committees, including the Legislative Policy Committee, Spending Affordability Committee, as chair of the Joint Information Technology and Biotechnology Committee, and as house chair of the Joint Committee on Transparency and Open Government. In 2015, Barve left his post as majority leader to become chair of the renamed Environment and Transportation Committee. His appointment coincided with the election of a new Republican Governor, Larry Hogan and debate over a number of significant environmental issues. Among the significant pieces of legislation Barve's committee worked on in the first year of the new term were a moratorium and public health study on fracking, a major reform to the state's stormwater protection fee, and debate over regulations which will require farms to severely limit the phosphorus that runs from their lands into the Chesapeake Bay. Barve's work as a legislator over the length of his career has focused on a broad range of issues. In 1995, he successfully sponsored the first state bill in the nation to regulate HMOs, the Maryland Health Access Act of 1995. The act allows health care patients to see doctors outside of the network of HMO providers, ensures that HMOs can't bar providers from sharing information if it jeopardizes patient care, and prohibits the use of financial incentives by HMOs that curtail and compromise care. He later co-sponsored the law that bars insurance companies based in Maryland from using pre-existing conditions to deny coverage. Barve has also worked extensively on the promotion of technology and of high tech businesses. He authored Maryland's version of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA). The Act both affirms the intellectual-property rights of software developers and provides unprecedented consumer protections to purchasers of computer equipment. He sponsored legislation that created the Technology Development Corporation of Maryland, which promotes high-technology business development in Maryland. In 1999, Barve's bill to define the powers of corporations in making certain gifts passed both houses and was signed by the governor. In the 2008 presidential election, Barve endorsed Barack Obama for President. Controversies In November 2007, Barve was cited by Gaithersburg Police for driving under the influence of alcohol while operating a vehicle. On July 17, 2008, Barve pleaded guilty and received a probation before judgement, and suspension of all but $200 of a $1,000 fine. In 2008, it was reported that Barve and his wife were inappropriately receiving a Homestead Property Tax Credit on two properties that they had owned separately prior to their marriage.

Within Belgium, resistance was fragmented between many separate organizations, divided by region and political stances. The resistance included both men and women from both Walloon and Flemish parts of the country. Aside from sabotage of military infrastructure in the country and assassinations of collaborators, these groups also published large numbers of underground newspapers, gathered intelligence and maintained various escape networks that helped Allied airmen trapped behind enemy lines escape from German-occupied Europe. During the war, it is estimated that approximately five percent of the national population were involved in some form of resistance activity, while some estimates put the number of resistance members killed at over 19,000; roughly 25 percent of its \\"active\\" members.Henri Bernard's estimate puts resistance casualties at 19,048 of around 70,000 active members. Quoted in Background=German invasion and occupation German forces invaded Belgium, which had been following a policy of neutrality, on 10 May 1940. After 18 days of fighting, the Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May and the country was placed under German military occupation. During the fighting, between 600,000 and 650,000 Belgian men (nearly 20 percent of the country's male population) served in the military. Many were made prisoners of war and detained in camps in Germany, although some were released before the end of the war. Leopold III, king and commander-in-chief of the army, also surrendered to the Germans on 28 May along with his army and was also held prisoner by the Germans. On 18 June the Belgian Government fled and arrived first in Bordeaux, France after the French government had fled to the region three days earlier. On that same day the Belgian government sent a telegram to the imprisoned Belgian king, stating their resignation to the king. Marcel-Henri Jaspar, the Belgian Minister of Health, went to London on 21 June without the permission of the government. He later gave a speech on BBC Radio on 23 June stating he would continue to fight against the Germans. Three days later the Belgian government stripped his ministerial title in reaction to the speech. Growth of resistance Examples of mimeograph machines used by the Belgian resistance to produce illegal newspapers and publications Among the first members of the Belgian resistance were former soldiers, and in particular officers, who, on their return from prisoner of war camps, wished to continue the fight against the Germans out of patriotism. Nevertheless, resistance was slow to develop in the first few months of the occupation because it seemed that German victory was imminent. The German failure to invade Great Britain, coupled with aggravating German policies within occupied Belgium, especially the persecution of Belgian Jews and conscription of Belgian civilians into forced labour programmes increasingly turned patriotic Belgian civilians from liberal or Catholic backgrounds against the German regime and towards the resistance. With the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, members of the Communist Party, which had previously been ambivalent towards both Allied and Axis sides, also joined the resistance en masse, forming their own separate groups calling for a \\"national uprising\\" against Nazi rule. During the First World War, Belgium had been occupied by Germany for four years and had developed an effective network of resistance, which provided key inspiration for the formation of similar groups in 1940. Most of the resistance was focused in the French-speaking areas of Belgium (Wallonia and the city of Brussels), although Flemish involvement in the resistance was also significant. Around 70 percent of underground newspapers were in French, while 60 percent of political prisoners were Walloon. Resistance during the German occupation=Passive resistance The most widespread form of resistance in occupied Belgium was non-violent. Listening to broadcasts from London, which was officially prohibited by the German occupiers, was a common form of passive resistance, but civil disobedience in particular was employed. This was often carried out by Belgian government institutions that were forced to carry out the administration of the territory on behalf of the German military government. In June 1941, the City Council of Brussels refused to distribute Star of David badges on behalf of the German government to Belgian Jews. Striking was the most common form of passive resistance and often took place on symbolic dates, such as the 10 May (anniversary of the German invasion), 21 July (National Day) and 11 November (anniversary of the German surrender in World War I). The largest was the so-called \\"Strike of the 100,000\\", which broke out on 10 May 1941 in the Cockerill steel works in Seraing. News of the strike spread rapidly and soon at least 70,000 workers came out on strike across the province of Li√®ge. The Germans increased workers' salaries by eight percent and the strike finished rapidly. Future large-scale strikes were repressed by the Germans, although further important strikes occurred in November 1942 and February 1943. King Leopold III, imprisoned in the in Laeken Castle, became a focal point for passive resistance, despite having been condemned by the government-in-exile for his decision to surrender. Active resistance Active resistance within Belgium developed from early 1941 and took several directions. Armed resistance, in the forms of sabotage or assassinations, took place, but was only part of the \\"active\\" resistance's scope of activity. Some groups had very specific forms of resistance and became extremely specialized. The group, for example, had many members in the national postal service and used them to intercept letters of denunciation, warning the denounced person to flee. In this way, they succeeded in intercepting over 20,000 letters. Membership of the active resistance, which had been quite low in the early years of the resistance, swelled exponentially during 1944 as it was joined by so-called \\"resisters of the eleventh hour\\" (r√©sistants de la onzi√®me heure) who could see that Allied victory was close, particularly in the months after D-Day. It is estimated that approximately five percent of the national population were involved in some form of \\"active\\" resistance during the war. =Structure and organisation= The Belgian resistance effort was extremely fragmented between various groups and never became a unified organization during the German occupation. The danger of infiltration posed by German informantsFor instance Prosper Dezitter, a spy who infiltrated several Belgian resistance groups, see meant that some cells were extremely small and localized, and although nationwide groups did exist, they were split along political and ideological lines. They ranged from the very left-wing, like the Communist or Socialist , to the far-right, like the monarchist and the which had been created by members of the pre-war Fascist movement. However, there were also other groups like which, though without an obvious political affiliation, recruited only from very specific demographics. Forms of active resistance=Sabotage and assassination Belgium's strategic location meant that it constituted an important supply hub for the whole German army in Northern Europe and particularly northern France. Sabotage was therefore an important duty of the resistance. Following the Normandy landings in June 1944 on orders from the Allies, the Belgian resistance began to step up its sabotage against German supply lines across the country. Between June and September alone, 95 railroad bridges, 285 locomotives, 1,365 wagons and 17 tunnels were all blown up by the Belgian resistance. Telegraph lines were also cut and road bridges and canals used to transport material sabotaged. In one notable action, 600 German soldiers were killed when a railway bridge between La Gleize and Stoumont in the Ardennes was blown up by 40 members of the resistance, including the writer Herman Bodson. Indeed, more German troops were reportedly killed in Belgium in 1941 than in all of Occupied France. Through its sabotage activities alone, one resistance group, , required the Germans to expend between 20 and 25 million man-hours of labour on repairing damage done, including ten million in the night of 15‚Äì16 January 1944 alone. Assassination of key figures in the hierarchy of German and collaborationist hierarchy became increasingly common through 1944. In July 1944, the assassinated the brother of L√©on Degrelle, head of the collaborationist Rexist Party and leading Belgian fascist. Informants and suspected double agents were also targeted; the Communist claimed to have killed over 1,000 traitors between June and September 1944. Clandestine press , a typical Dutch- language underground publication, October 1940 issue. During the occupation an underground press flourished in Belgium from soon after the Belgian defeat, with eight newspapers appearing by October 1940 alone. Much of the resistance's press focused around producing newspapers in both French and Dutch language as alternatives to collaborationist newspapers like Le Soir. At its peak, the clandestine newspaper La Libre Belgique was relaying news within five to six days; faster than the BBC's French-language radio broadcasts, whose coverage lagged several months behind events. Copies of the underground newspapers were distributed anonymously, with some pushed into letterboxes or sent by post. Since they were usually free, the costs of printing were financed by donations from sympathisers. The papers achieved considerable circulation, with reaching a regular circulation of 40,000 by January 1942 and peaking at 70,000, while the Communist paper, , reached 30,000. Dozens of different newspapers existed, often affiliated with different resistance groups or differentiated by political stance, ranging from nationalist, Communist, Liberal or even Feminist. The number of Belgians involved in the underground press is estimated at anywhere up to 40,000 people. In total, 567 separate titles are known from the period of occupation. The resistance also printed humorous publications and material as propaganda. In November 1943, on the anniversary of the German surrender in the First World War, the group published a spoof edition of the collaborationist newspaper , satirizing the Axis propaganda and biased information permitted by the censors, which was then distributed to newsstands across Brussels and deliberately mixed with official copies of the newspaper. 50,000 copies of the spoof publication, dubbed the \\"Faux Soir\\" (or \\"Fake Soir\\"), were distributed. Intelligence gathering Intelligence gathering was one of the first forms of resistance to grow after the Belgian defeat and eventually developed into complex and carefully structured organizations. The Allies were also deeply reliant on the resistance to provide intelligence from the occupied country. This information focused both on German troop movements and other military information, but was also essential for keeping the allies abreast of the attitudes and popular opinion of the Belgian public. Each network was closely organized and carried a codename. The most significant was \\"Clarence\\", led by Walth√®re Dew√©, which had over 1,000 members feeding it information which was then communicated to London by radio. Other notable networks were \\"Luc\\" (renamed \\"Marc\\" in 1942) and \\"Z√©ro\\". In total 43 separate intelligence networks existed in Belgium, involving some 14,000 people. The Belgian resistance provided around 80 percent of all information received by the Allies from all resistance groups in Europe. Resistance to the Holocaust The Belgian resistance was instrumental in saving Jews and Roma from deportation to death camps. In April 1943, members of the resistance group, the successfully attacked the \\"Twentieth convoy\\" carrying 1,500 Belgian Jews by rail to Auschwitz in Poland. Many Belgians also hid Jews and political dissidents during the occupation: one estimate put the number at some 20,000 people hidden during the war. There was also significant low-level resistance: for instance, in June 1941, the City Council of Brussels refused to distribute Stars of David badges. Certain high-profile members of the Belgian establishment, including Queen Elizabeth and Cardinal van Roey, Archbishop of Malines, spoke out against the German treatment of Jews. In total, 1,612 Belgians have been awarded the distinction of \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" by the State of Israel for risking their lives to save Jews from persecution during the occupation. Escape routes As the Allies intensified their strategic bombing campaign from 1941, the resistance began to experience a significant increase in the number of Allied airmen from the RAF and USAAF who had been shot down but evaded capture. The resistance's aim, assisted by the British MI9 organization, was to escort them out of occupied Europe and over the Pyrenees to neutral Spain where they might return to England. The best-known of these networks, the Comet Line, organized by Andr√©e de Jongh, involved some 2,000 resistance members and was able to escort 700 Allied airmen to Spain. The Line not only fed, housed, and provided civilian clothing for the pilots, but also forged Belgian and French identity cards and rail fares. As the airmen also needed to be hidden in civilian houses for prolonged periods of time, escape lines were particularly vulnerable. During the course of the war, 800 members of the \\"Comet\\" line alone were arrested by the Gestapo of whom 140 were executed. German response The entrance to Fort Breendonk where many captured members of the resistance were held The German Geheime Staatspolizei (\\"Secret state police\\"), known as the Gestapo, was responsible for targeting resistance groups in Belgium. Resistance fighters who were captured could expect to be interrogated, tortured and either summarily executed or sent to a concentration camp. The Gestapo was effective at using informants within groups to betray whole local resistance network and in examining resistance publications for clues about its place of production. 2,000 resistance members involved in underground press alone were arrested during the war. In total, 30,000 members of the resistance were captured during the war, of whom 16,000 were executed or died in captivity. The Germans requisitioned the former Belgian army Fort Breendonk, near Mechelen, which was used for torture and interrogation of political prisoners and members of the resistance. Around 3,500 inmates passed through the camp at Breendonk where they were kept in extremely degrading conditions. Around 300 people were killed in the camp itself, with at least 98 of them dying from deprivation or torture. Towards the end of the war, the militias of collaborationist political parties also began to participate actively in reprisals for attacks or assassinations by the resistance. These included both reprisal assassinations of leading figures suspected of resistance involvement or sympathy (including Alexandre Galopin, head of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, who was assassinated in February 1944) or retaliatory massacres against civilians. Foremost among these was the Courcelles Massacre, a reprisal by Rexist paramilitaries for the assassination of a Burgomaster, in which 20 civilians were killed. A similar massacre also took place at Meensel-Kiezegem, where 67 were killed. Relations with the Allies and Belgian government in exile The Belgian government in exile made its first call for the creation of organized resistance in the country from its first place of exile in Bordeaux, before its flight to London after the French surrender: Supplies for the Resistance dropped by British aircraft in the countryside north of Brussels. Nevertheless, the apparent isolation of the government in exile from the day-to-day situation in Belgium meant that it was viewed with suspicion by many resistance groups, particularly those whose politics differed from that of the established government. The government, for its part, was afraid that resistance groups would turn into ungovernable political militias after liberation, challenging the government's position and threatening political stability. Nevertheless, the resistance was frequently reliant on finance and drops of equipment and supplies which both the government-in-exile and the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) were able to provide. During the course of the war, the government-in-exile delivered between 124-245 million francs, dropped by parachute or transferred via bank accounts in neutral Portugal, to the group alone, with smaller sums also distributed to other organisations. In the early years of the war, contact with the government in exile was difficult to establish. The dispatched a member to try to establish contact in May 1941, it took a full year to reach London. Radio contact was briefly established in late 1941, however, the contact was extremely intermittent between 1942 and 1943, with a permanent radio connection to the (codenamed \\"Stanley\\") only established in 1944. In May 1944, the government-in-exile attempted to rebuild its relationship with the resistance by establishing a \\"Coordination Committee\\" of representatives of the major groups, including the L√©gion Belge, Mouvement National Belge, Groupe G and the Front de l'Ind√©pendance. However, the committee was rendered redundant by the liberation in September. The Resistance during the Liberation British soldier during the fighting around Antwerp, 1944. After the Normandy Landings in June 1944, the Belgian resistance increased in size dramatically. In April 1944, the began to adopt an official rank hierarchy and uniform (of white overalls and armband) to be worn on missions in order to give their organization the status of an \\"official army\\". Though they usually lacked the equipment and training to fight the Wehrmacht openly, the resistance played a key role in assisting the Allies during the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, providing information on German troop movements, disrupting German evacuation plans and participating in fighting. The resistance was particularly important during the liberation of the city of Antwerp, where the local resistance from the and , in an unprecedented display of inter-group cooperation, assisted British and Canadian forces in capturing the highly strategic port of Antwerp intact, before it could be sabotaged by the German garrison. Across Belgium, 20,000 German soldiers (including two generals) were taken prisoner by the resistance, before being handed over to the Allies. The Free Belgian 5th SAS was dropped by parachute into the Ardennes where it linked up with members of the local resistance during the liberation and the Battle of the Bulge. All together, almost 4,000 members of the alone were killed during the liberation. Disarmament Soon after the liberation, the reestablished government in Brussels attempted to disarm and demobilize the resistance. In particular, the government feared the organizations would degenerate into armed political militias which could threaten the country's political stability. In October 1944 the government ordered members of the resistance to surrender their weapons to the police and, in November, threatened to search the houses and fine those who had retained them. This provoked significant anger among resistance members, who had hoped that they would be able to continue fighting alongside the Allies in the invasion of Germany. On 25 November, a large demonstration of former resistance members took place in Brussels. As the crowds moved towards the Parliament, British soldiers fired on the crowd, which they suspected to be trying to make left-wing coup d'√©tat. 45 people were wounded. Nevertheless, large numbers of former members of the resistance enlisted into the regular army, where they formed around 80% of the strength of the Belgian Fusilier Battalions which served on the Western Front until VE Day. Legacy The Belgian resistance was praised by contemporaries for its contribution to the Allied war effort; particularly during the later period. In a letter to Lieutenant-General Pire, commander of the , General Eisenhower praised the role that the Belgian resistance had played in disrupting German supply lines after D-Day. The continuing actions of the resistance stopped the Germans ever being able to use the country as a secure base, never fully becoming pacified. The attempt of the resistance to enter mainstream politics with a formal party, the Belgian Democratic Union, failed to attract the level of support that similar parties had managed in France and elsewhere. Associations of former members were founded in the years immediately after the war and campaigned for greater recognition of the role of the resistance. The largest association, the , continues to fund historical research on the role of the resistance and defending the interests of its members. In December 1946, the government of Camille Huysmans inaugurated a medal to be awarded to former members of the resistance and bestowed various other benefits on other members, including pensions and a scheme of state-funded apprenticeships. Individuals were accorded military rank equivalent to their status in the movement during the war, entitling them to title and other privileges. Today the role of the resistance during the conflict is commemorated by memorials, plaques and road names across the country, as well as by the National Museum of the Resistance in Anderlecht.

History The Kambata kingdom was ruled by long line of its own kings known as Woma,. King Dagoye, from Oyeta clan, was one of the famous kings known for expanding Kambata territories. The last independent king of Kambata was king (Woma) Delbato Degoye. An important landmark for the Kambaata people is Mount Hambaricho, where their king, Woma, used to live and the people used to celebrate annual festivities in the past. The king and the god of Kambata lived there. Subsistence They have many indigenous traditional foods, among which kocho which is processed from ensete, is their staple diet. They also grow many kinds of tubers, spices, coffee, crops, and vegetables. Society Kambata society used to have stratified social classes such as Womano and Contoma. In kembata province there are other clans like Tembaro, Alaba and many more different clans live together and become Kembata. The most isolated clan in Kembata province is tanners shekla seriwoch (fuga), this clan could not participate in any socio-economic activities with kembata. Kembata people could never marry tanners (fuga) clan. Kambata is one of the most densely populated regions in Ethiopia. The Kambata pride themselves as one of the best-educated in the country. Due to over population and lack of economic opportunities in their region, they migrate to large cities, industrial areas and large plantation farms. In recent years they experienced a large influx of migration to South Africa and Middle Eastern countries.

Musa is the founder and director of As-Sabiqun, and the Islamic Institute of Counter-Zionist American Psychological Warfare which has been identified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Background Abdul Alim was born in Arkansas in 1945 but was raised in Oakland, California during the 1960s. It was during this period that he associated with H. Rap Brown (Imam Jamil Al-Amin), who later converted to Islam. Having set up a drug dealing operation in Colombia, Musa was arrested on charges including heroin smuggling, currency smuggling and assaulting a federal agent. After evading the authorities for several years, Musa fled to Algeria, where he came in contact with several self-exiled Black Panther leaders such as Eldridge Cleaver. After returning to the U.S., he turned himself in and was eventually incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth. While in prison, Musa converted to orthodox Sunni Islam. Musa supported the Iranian Revolution, believing that it would lead to the revival of Islam. Travel to Iran Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Musa publicly expressed his support for the Islamic republic and its leader, Ruhollah Khomeini. Since the early 1980s, he made several visits to Iran as a representative of American Muslims. In February 2013, Musa attended the International Conference on Hollywoodism and spoke negatively about the portrayal of Muslims portrait in United States films. Musa made connections with a wide array of Muslim leaders during the decade ‚Äì both Sunni and Shia ‚Äì and stressed that unity was a primary objective for the Islamic movements success. His references the writings of Malcolm X, Ayatollah Khomeini, Sayyid Qutb, Maulana Maududi, and Kalim Siddiqui. New members of the group are encouraged to individually familiarize themselves with the works of these political Islamic thinkers in addition to daily classes and lectures on classical Islamic studies, Arabic, hadith and Quran. Allegations of Antisemitism According to the Anti-Defamation League, Musa \\"propagates a radical and anti-Semitic ideology.\\" He is quoted as saying: ‚ÄúWho ran the slave trade‚Ä¶who funded [it]? You‚Äôll study and you will find out: the Jews‚Ä¶It was the Jewish bankers‚Ä¶in Vienna, with pockets full of money, funding and insuring, that‚Äôs who did it‚Ä¶. you can‚Äôt tell us about no holocaust. Between the African Americans and the Native Americans, everybody else‚Äôs stuff was small potatoes.‚Äù According to Benjamin Ginsberg, student groups the Associated Students of the University of Washington and the Black Students Commission allegedly sponsored \\"a vehemently anti-semitic\\" speech by Musa, in which he asserted that America was controlled by Jews, and that \\"Yahuds are the enemy of humanity.\\" Critics have suggested that he promotes anti-semitism in his speeches, which he defends are directed at Zionist supporters of Israel and not at Jews in general, although some of his statements suggest otherwise, such as: ‚ÄúAl-Amin‚Ä¶turned his ideas, his belief in Islam, into practical solutions for society. And they can‚Äôt stand that. Just like our brother said: the Zionists are the same today as they was then. In those days [in pre- Islamic Arabia] they controlled the liquor market in Madinah‚Ä¶and the Zionists kept the Arab leaders broke and drunk‚Ä¶the yahud [Arabic word for Jew] were sitting back and had each one of them [Arab clans] fighting each other because the leaders was both drunken and they was all in owe [sic] to the same Yahud‚Ä¶he was manipulating the Arabs‚Ä¶then Islam came [and abolished Riba, or interest].\\" Since 2000 Musa said that \\"I would love to have a case in court with the FBI. I would love for them to arrest me on any trumped-up charges.\\" Musa later commented that \\"I tried to get a case several years ago. We had a demonstration. I waved a check for Hamas, cashier's check, by the way. And I said, 'I'm donating this to Hamas.' Then I waited for them to arrest me. They didn't arrest me. So I put the thing back in the bank.\\" At the January 21, 2001 event titled Shaping Our Perspective: Our Role in a Changing World, sponsored by the Muslim Students Association at UCLA, Musa is quoted as stating: \\"If you were to say that the Soviet Union was wiped off the face of the Earth . . . people would have thought you were crazy, right? The people of Afghanistan didn‚Äôt have the intellect or historical knowledge to know that they wasn‚Äôt supposed to wipe out the Soviet Union, is that right? . . . We saw the fall of one so-called superpower, Old Sam (the United States) is next.\\" On October 6, 2002, he spoke on Muhammad's model of leadership and its modern applications at the ICIT Seerah Conference in Sri Lanka.Crescent International, October 16‚Äì30, 2002 On July 7, 2000 Musa, while in the company of his wife and daughter, witnessed the Metropolitan Police Department beating a citizen. He attempted to intervene by approaching the officers and telling them to stop. They continued until Musa grabbed one of the officers and was consequently arrested for assaulting the police. He spent two nights in jail before appearing before a judge on July 10. In court, the police reduced the charge against him to a misdemeanor.Crescent International Newsmagazine, July 16‚Äì30, 2000 Musa has made a number of controversial statements: *Zionist American agents blew up the World Trade Center *Palestinian suicide bombers are heroes *The U.S. government saturated U.S. cities with heroin in the 1960s to snuff out black rebellion *The United States should become an Islamic state In a video aired by Fox News, Musa stated, from behind a podium at the University of California at Irvine on Sept. 9, 2001: \\"If you don't stay out of our way and leave us alone, we're going to burn America down.\\" Musa later stated that he was simply paraphrasing Jamil Al-Amin, formerly H. Rap Brown, a prominent Black Panther in the 1960s. Musa never threatened to burn the United States down, according to a longer video and transcript of the speech posted on the Web site of The Investigative Project.Abdul Alim Musa ‚Äì Profile at the Investigative Project on Terrorism. Musa has stated that \\"The American ship is going down, and it's clowns like that [President George W. Bush] that's driving it down. We don't have to do nothing. Just step back, pray, fast, do good deeds, and stuff like that. And let that guy go. . . . When he finishes, nobody will love, nobody will trust, and nobody will believe anything coming from the United States of America.\\" In January 2010, during a debate with George Mason University professor Jack Goldstone on Iranian Press TV, Musa said \\"they (Americans) set up the Mexicans...\\" and that \\"The American history is a history of robbing and stealing, and setting up people in order to get what they want.\\"Washington DC Imam Abdul Alim Musa: Attempted Christmas Day Plane Bombing ‚Äì the Work of US Government and the Mossad, MEMRITV.org, Clip No. 2326, January 5, 2010. Banning from the United Kingdom In April 2009, Musa's name was released to the press as one of 22 people banned from entering the United Kingdom in October 2008. The Home Office said this was due to his being \\"Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behavior by fomenting and glorifying terrorist violence in furtherance of his particular beliefs and seeking to provoke others to terrorist acts.\\" Islamic Institute of Counter- Zionist American Psychological Warfare In 2011 Musa founded the Islamic Institute of Counter-Zionist American Psychological Warfare, distributing flyers that say \\"For 30 years, Masjid Al-Islam [Sabiqun's mosque] has been carrying on a direct, face-to-face struggle against the monolithic Zionist American regime... We are an anti-Zionist American psycho-guerrilla warfare movement. We use all available tools found in our environment in exposing the anti-Islamic, anti-human policies of this Zionist American system.\\" The mission is \\"to counter the concerted efforts of the enemies of Islam to sustain a false characterization of Islam and Muslims as a dangerous threat to global stability and tranquility.\\" The institute was established to \\"monitor Zionist and Israeli networks, circles, and clubs which deceitfully infiltrate Muslim and Black groups,\\" according to a June 2010 Sabiqun newsletter. In a January 2011 statement announcing the opening of the Oakland branch, Sabiqun also declared that one of the institute's goals is to \\"Analyze the Zionist grip on humanity established via the media and economics.\\"Sabiqun and Anti- Semitism on Campus, Anti-Defamation League, September 11, 2009.

The 'unusual' aspect may be the route of the train, the destination, specific sections of railway track (for example, freight-only lines), the locomotive hauling the train, the rolling stock (passenger carriages), or any combination of these. Organisers may own or hire locomotives or rolling stock, or tours may be organised by railway management or other bodies outside the railway fraternity. Perhaps the most famous railtour in England was the Fifteen Guinea Special, the last steam hauled main line train run by British Rail. Railtours are often identifiable through the use of a train headboard, often identifying the name of the specific tour or the tour operator. On TOPS, railtours are always given a 1Zxx headcode. Types of Railtour=Destination tours A 'destination' railtour is often associated with a special event of railway significance. Open days or special events at heritage railway locations such as Barrow Hill Engine Shed and the West Somerset Railway have been destinations for railtours originating from large cities. Similarly, organisations such as the Crusader Union may hire a train to take a large number of people to a specific event. Locomotive tours A 'locomotive' railtour focusses on the type of locomotive hauling the train. This may be a preserved locomotive, a type not usually used for passenger trains, or a type of locomotive which normally works some distance from the chosen route. Railtours in the 1980s saw a Class 52 running to York and a Class 55 to Exeter. Nostalgic tours One type of railtour which is currently popular is the nostalgic excursion using a preserved train, or sometimes a train hired from a railway operator. Preserved steam locomotives are popular performers on UK railtours, sometimes covering 400 miles in one day at speeds of over 75 miles per hour. Train, branding and route are often chosen as to reflect a common theme, sometimes tracing an aspect of railway history. Railtours are organised both on a commercial basis and as a fund- raising method for railway preservation societies. Track or route tours A track or route railtour is focused on travelling over sections of railway track that are not used by scheduled passenger trains. Locations ‚Äì such as Carne Point at Fowey, Cornwall ‚Äì which have not seen passenger trains for several decades, or locations that have never had a public passenger service ‚Äì such as the MOD depot at Long Marston ‚Äì can be traversed by such trains.

She has worked for both Ohio Valley Wrestling and Women's Extreme Wrestling. She is known for starring in the 2015 horror anthology film Volumes of Blood. Professional wrestling career=Ohio Valley Wrestling (2006‚Äì2008) Jonah originally pursued a career in professional wrestling because she \\"thought it looked fun\\". Her extensive theater and sports background made wrestling an obvious choice. After completing her English degree, she moved to Louisville to train. She made her debut at the March 18, 2006 Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) house show from Shepherdsville, Kentucky, teaming with Cherry to defeat Serena Deeb. A month later, at a house show in Austin, Indiana, Jonah lost to Beth Phoenix by disqualification when Shelly Martinez came out and attacked Phoenix. She made her OVW television debut in the spring of 2006, managing Mike Mizanin and playing the role of Mizanin's girlfriend. The May 10 TV tapings featured Jonah and Mizanin defeating the combo of Seth Skyfire and Shelly Martinez after Beth Phoenix interfered. The Miz's was then called up to WWE's main roster. Jonah continued in WEW for a while, where she still holds the tag team title to this day, with Cyndi Snow. Eventually, she went on to start a career in film. Occasionally, Jonah still wrestles for fun. Women's Extreme Wrestling On July 12, 2007 Jonah, along with Principle Lazarus, aka Cyndi \\"Bobcat\\", captured the Women's Extreme Wrestling (WEW) Tag Team Title by defeating Amy Zidian and Annie Social. They successfully defended the straps at WEW's \\"Tit For Tat\\" show against the makeshift duo of Becky Bayless and Lucy Furr. On July 21, 2008 the duo yet again successfully defended their WEW tag team title, against the team of Amy Lee and Annie Social at the \\"Locker Room Lust\\" show. Personal life Jonah designed all of Kelly Kelly's Extreme Expos√© gear, Shelly Martinez's gimmick attire while she was in World Wrestling Entertainment, and all of her own attire used in OVW. At one point, she had an online clothing store. Jonah has an English degree with a minor in theater. Film career Jonah started a new course in entertainment with film making. Roni landed in the top 3 actresses for a nationwide contest held by massify.com and After Dark Films in search of talent for the film Perkins 14. Roni teamed with fellow massify contestant and Kentucky actor Jason Crowe to co-write, star and direct the feature film The Legacy where Jonah also did all the SPFX work. Soon after Jonah and Crowe began work on another film entitled Hell House. In it, Jonah re-claimed her role as Suicide Betty from The Legacy. Jonah co-wrote, starred and created all SPFX for Hell House. Jonah has also written and directed two short film entitled Trepan and Malfunction. Roni has been involved in several additional projects in various capacities, including Little Sex Shop of Horrors, Girl/Girl Scene, Swordbearer, Truth or Dare V: Deadly Dares, and Old Days. Jonah's SPFX work can also be seen in the new film Red River. Roni is in post production on her first feature film The Zombie Movie, due out by Christmas 2014 Since 2010, Jonah has been a series regular in Tucky Williams' web series Girl/Girl Scene. Jonah will appear in the horror film Victim alongside Jordan Danyluk. Recently, Roni co-wrote and co-starred in the movie, Selling Stupid, alongside Director and co-writer, Tonia Carrier. Jonah is currently appearing as Jenna in the fantasy series Dagger Kiss, created by Tucky Williams, her co-star in Girl/Girl Scene. In 2015, Jonah starred in the 2015 horror anthology film, Volumes of Blood. The film has received critical acclaim, and Jonah's performance earned her an award at the 2015 Mayday Film Festival for \\"Best Actress in a Feature.\\" Jonah is set to co- star in the independent horror feature film, The Bloody Man, alongside A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master stars, Lisa Wilcox and Tuesday Knight. The cast launched a successful Kickstarter campaign, and the film is slated for release in 2019.

In the United States, the value is typically based on a forecast of revenues (generally 10 years for films and 20 years for television shows), beginning with theatrical release, and including DVD sales, and release to cable broadcast television networks both domestic and international and inflight airline licensing.  Public sources =Government grants A number of governments run programs to subsidise the cost of producing films. For instance, until it was abolished in March 2011, in the United Kingdom the UK Film Council provided National Lottery funding to producers, as long as certain conditions were met. Many of the Council's functions have now been taken over by the British Film Institute. States such as Georgia, Ohio, Louisiana, New York, Connecticut, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Utah, and New Mexico, will provide a subsidy or tax credit provided all or part of a film is filmed in that state. Governments are willing to provide these subsidies as they hope it will attract creative individuals to their territory and stimulate employment. Also, a film shot in a particular location can have the benefit of advertising that location to an international audience. Government subsidies are often pure grants, where the government expects no financial return. Tax incentives Some U.S. states and Canadian provinces have between 15% and 70% tax or cash incentives for labor, production costs or services on bona fide film/television/PCgame expenditures. Each state and province differs. These so-called \\"soft-money\\" incentives are generally not realized until a theatrical or interactive production is completed, all payments are made to workers, financial institutions, and rental or prop companies within the state or province offering the incentives. Many other limitations may apply (i.e., actors, cast and crew may have to take up residence in the state or province). Often, a certain amount of physical shooting (principal photography) must be completed within the state borders, and/or the use of the state's institutions. This would include rental facilities, banks, insurance companies, sound stages or studios, agents, agencies, brokers, catering companies, hotel/motels, etc. Each may also have to be physically domiciled within the state or province's borders. Finally, additional incentives (another 5% to 25% on top of the already generous soft money), may be offered for off-season, low-income area, or family entertainment projects shot in places of economic impoverishment or during poor weather condition months in a hurricane-prone state or Arctic province. A number of countries have introduced legislation that has the effect of generating enhanced tax deductions for producers or owners of films. Incentives are created which effectively sell the enhanced tax deductions to wealthy individuals with large tax liabilities (e.g., IRS code sections 181 and 199). The individual will often become the legal owner of the film or certain rights relating to the film. In 2007 the United Kingdom government introduced the Producer's Tax Credit which results in a direct cash subsidy from the treasury to the film producer. =German tax shelters= A relatively new tactic for raising finance is through German tax shelters. The tax law of Germany allows investors to take an instant tax deduction even on non-German productions and even if the film has not yet gone into production. The film producers can sell the copyright to one of these tax shelters for the cost of the film's budget, then have them lease it back for a price around 90% of the original cost. On a $100 million film, a producer could make $10 million, minus fees to lawyers and middlemen. This tactic favors big-budget films as the profit on more modestly budgeted films would be consumed by the legal and administrative costs. Despite its frequent use in the past, the above schemes are all but gone and are being replaced by more traditional production incentives.Teutons push for new plan, a May 2006 article from Variety The main production incentive is the (DFFF). The DFFF is a grant given by the German Federal Commissioner for Culture and the Media. To receive the grant a producer has to fulfill different requirements including a cultural eligibility test. The film finance calculator on germanfilmfinance.com checks online if the project passes the test as well as it shows the individually calculated estimated grant. =British tax shelters= In British tax shelters, the same copyright can be sold again to a British company and a further $10 million could be raised, but UK law insists that part of the film is shot in Britain and that the production employs a fair proportion of British actors and crew. By using British tax shelter methods, many American films like to shoot at Britain's major film studios like Pinewood and Shepperton and why a film such as Basic Instinct 2 relocated its action from New York to London. These are commonly referred to Sale & Leaseback deals; they were discontinued in March 2007, though those initiated prior to Dec. 31, 2006 were grandfathered in.  Private sources =Debt financingPre-sales= Pre-sales is, based on the script and cast, selling the right to distribute a film in different territories before the film is completed. When the deal is made, the distributor will insist the producers deliver on certain elements of content and cast; if a material alteration is made, financing may collapse. In order to gain the ‚Äúmarquee names‚Äù essential for drawing in an international audience, distributors and sale agents will often make casting suggestions. Pre-sales contracts with big-name actors or directors will often (at the insistence of the buyer) have an \\"essential element\\" clause that (as per the example above) allows the buyer to get out of the contract if the star or director falls out of the picture and a marquee equivalent cannot be procured. The reliance on pre-sales explains the film industry's dependence on movie stars, directors and/or certain film genres (such as Horror). Typically, upon signing a pre-sale contract, the buyer will pay a 20% deposit to the film's collection account (or bank), with the balance (80%) due upon the film's delivery to the foreign sales agent (along with all the necessary deliverable requirements.) Usually a producer pre-sells foreign territories (in whole or part) and/or North American windows/rights (i.e. theatrical, home video/DVD, pay TV, free TV, etc.) so that the producer can use the value of those contracts as collateral for the production loan that a bank (senior lender) is providing to finance the production. =Television pre-sales= Although it is more usual for a producer to sell the TV rights of this film after it has been made, it is sometimes possible to sell the rights in advance and use the money to pay for the production. In some cases the television station will be a subsidiary of the movie studio's parent company. =Negative pickup deal= A negative pickup deal is a contract entered into by an independent producer and a movie studio wherein the studio agrees to purchase the movie from the producer at a given date and for a fixed sum. Until then, the financing is up to the producer, who must pay any additional costs if the film goes over-budget. Generally, a producer will have a bank/lender lend against the value of the negative pickup contract as a way to shore up their financing package of the film. This is commonly referred to as \\"factoring paper\\". Most major North American studio and network contracts (incl. basic cable) are collateralized/factored by the bank at 100% of the contract value, and the lender just takes a basic origination/setup fee. Splitting the roles of studios and networks necessitated a means for financing television series appropriate to the varied risks and rewards inherent in the separation. A practice known as \\"deficit financing\\" consequently developed ‚Äì an arrangement in which the network pays the studio that make a show a license fee in exchange for the right to air the show, but the studio retains ownership. The license fee does not fully cover the costs of production ‚Äì hence the \\"deficit\\" of deficit financing.Lotz, Amanda D. (2007) ‚ÄúThe Television Will Be Revolutionized‚Äù. New York, NY: New York University Press. P. 83 Deficit financing developed after the varied risks and rewards were determined and carried out through film financing. Deficit financing occurs when the license fee for a show doesn't fully cover production fees. A studio has ownership of the production, but as license fees are handed out in exchange to air a show, the phrase deficit financing comes into play as costs were not being met and paid. From the late 1960s through the mid-1990s special regulations from financial regulation's and syndication's rules created relations between television networks and independent production companies. These rules stated that ownership of the rights to the programs reverted to the producer/production company after a specified number of network runs (syndication). Profits from any other sales, including syndication, generally benefited the production community. Because of this, production companies produced original shows at a loss, hoping that they would eventually be run by syndication and make their money back.2\\\\. Kaplar, Richard T. The Financial Interest and Syndication Rules: Prime Time for Repeal. Washington, D.C.: Media Institute, 1990. =Gap/supergap financing= In motion pictures, gap/supergap financing is a form of mezzanine debt financing where the producer wishes to complete their film finance package by procuring a loan that is secured against the film's unsold territories and rights. Most gap financiers will only lend against the value of unsold foreign (non-North American) rights, as domestic (North American: USA & Canadian) rights are seen as a \\"performance\\" risk, as opposed to more quantifiable risk that is the foreign market. In short, this means that the foreign value of a film can be ascertained by a foreign sales company/agent by evaluating the blended value of the quality of the script, its genre, cast, director, producer, as well as whether it has theatrical distribution in the US from a major film studio; all of this is taken into consideration and applied against the historical and current market tastes, trends, and needs of each foreign territory of country. This is still an unpredictable practice. Domestic distribution is also unpredictable and far from ever a sure thing (e.g. just because a film has a big budget and a commercial genre and cast, it could still be unwatchable and thus never receive a theatrical or television release in the US, thus being relegated to being a big budget, direct-to-video film.) Any certainty in the entertainment business, lending against foreign value estimates is preferable to betting on strictly a domestic success (comedies and urban films being two notable exceptions: they are referred to as \\"domestic pieces\\" or \\"domestic plays\\".) True to its mezzanine nature, in the pecking order of recoupment of investment, generally, gap (or supergap) loans are subordinate to (recoup after) the senior/bank production loan, but in turn, the gap/supergap loan will be senior to (recoup before) equity financiers. A gap loan becomes a supergap loan when it extends beyond 10-15% of the production loan required to shoot the film (or in other words, when the percentage of the gap required to complete the film's financing package becomes greater than a bank is willing to bear, which is traditionally 10-15%, but can sometime be a flat dollar threshold like US$1,000,000.) Gap/supergap lending is a very risky form of capital investment and accordingly the fees and interest charged reflect that level of risk. But at the same time it is not unlike buying a house: nobody pays 100% of the purchase price with cash; they pay about 20% in cash and borrow the rest. Supergap financing works by the same principle: put down 20-30% cash/equity and borrow the rest. Over the years, because of the high risk nature, many supergap companies have come and gone, but a few established players have survived the ups and downs of the markets with Relativity Media, Screen Capital International, Grosvenor Park, Helios Productions, Endgame Entertainment, Blue Rider, Newmarket Capital, Aramid Entertainment, MDG Entertainment Holdings, Limelight, RJG Entertainment, BondIt Media Capital and 120 dB all active in the current debt financing space. The Internet portal germanfilmfinance.com aims to support national and international film makers in the acquisition of production financing. By combining national and regional financing components including a Supergap loan, it is possible to finance up to 50% - 65% of the entire film project budget. =Bridge financing= Bridge finance has increased in prevalence in filmmaking in recent years. Bridge financing is an answer to the common \\"catch-22\\" problem of needing funding to get the actors, but not being able to get the funding without actors. Bridge financing, for example, can be used in scenarios where a filmmaker has a promissory note from an investor to finance a film provided the filmmaker can attach an approved actor, however without money to escrow for the actor's payment, the filmmaker is unable to meet the investor's criteria. In this instance, a short-term lender can provide a bridge loan to secure the actor with the promissory note as collateral; once the actor's payment is escrowed, the equity investment would be triggered, and the bridge loan would be paid back with a small interest. Slate financing A relatively new method of financing, slate financing \\"involves an investment in a specified number of studio films ranging from a mere handful to dozens of pictures\\", typically by private equity firms and hedge funds. Slate financing's proliferation typifies the \\"complex relationship that has developed between the studios and Wall Street\\". Between 2005 and 2008, hedge funds invested an estimated $4 billion in studio film slates and private equity firms invested $8 billion. The idea for slate financing came from \\"multifilm credit lines\\" that banks and investment firms created for studios in the late 1990s. There were three main advantages to this strategy: risk mitigation (since funds covered a pool of movies rather than one film), less interference from investors, and freeing up studio equity towards \\"big-budget franchises\\" for which they do not have trouble fundraising. In 2005, Relativity Media CEO Ryan Kavanaugh built upon these points to structure the first slate financing deal, a 17-picture joint deal with Sony Pictures and Universal Studios called Gun Hill Road that was backed by $600 million from hedge funds. Slate financing preserved the benefits of the earlier credit lines, as it allows them to risk less of their own capital when financing high-budget films. After deducting production costs, including prints and advertising (P&A;) and residuals, studios split remaining box office revenue with investing partners; oftentimes they also split revenue from DVD and merchandise sales. Generally tax-advantaged theatrical film and television investment for affluent individuals comes with little risk. In general, production costs can be recouped through federal and state tax incentives, thereby eliminating most of the risk. Capital is still required as a direct investment (partnerships can be used), but must also be \\"at risk\\", which allows ¬ß 181 IRC write-offs. For example, if a private equity source is found (individuals with capital or a private wealth management firm representing personal funds), the investor pays for the film or TV production, and in return receives an equal amount of capital in tax-incentives, pre-sales, and state tax credits, thereby making the investment and recoup a wash. This is a highly specialized tax play, and is often looked upon as risky by those who do not understand the risk mitigation offered through state tax and federal tax incentives like ¬ß 181 IRC. Individual investors One of the hardest types of film financing pieces to obtain is private investor funds. These are funds invested by an individual who is looking to possibly add more risk to their investment portfolio, or a high-net-worth individual with a keen interest in films. While there are a few steps to cover between development funding and capital funding, with regard to the latter, any capital funding that is approached, whether that source is private equity (private individuals and /or funding groups), or debt financing (finance institutions and /or banks), is going to require that you have certain necessary elements in place before they consider financing your project. These elements include marketplace analytics, audience analytics, a bondable schedule and budget, and a distribution plan.  Other financing methods =Product placement Income from product placement can be used to supplement the budget of a film. The Bond franchise is notable for its lucrative product placements deals, bringing in millions of dollars. In the film Minority Report, Lexus, Bulgari and American Express reportedly paid a combined $20 million for product placement, a record-high amount. Product placement may also take the form of in-kind contributions to the film, such as free cars or computers (as props or for the production's use). While no money changes hands, the films budget will be lowered by the amount that would have otherwise been spent on such items. Crowdfunding A video pitch on website Indiegogo for the film Being Impossible, which was successfully crowdfunded after the Crisis in Venezuela devalued previous funding awarded to the film With a rising popularity of online crowdfunding more and more films are getting financed directly by their consumers this way. The crowdfunding platforms Kickstarter and IndieGoGo have their own categories dedicated to films. Crowdfunding films gives the consumer a voice in what films are being produced, allow for riskier, more socially relevant, more innovative, less profit-oriented independent films with smaller and marginal target audiences that can't be found in mainstream cinema and lower the entry- barrier to new filmmakers. Crowdfunded films include Iron Sky, Kung Fury, Veronica Mars, Code 8, Star Trek: Renegades, Manthan and Anomalisa.  Overview  Film finance is a subset of project finance, meaning the film project's generated cash flows rather than external sources are used to repay investors. The main factors determining the commercial success of a film include public taste, artistic merit, competition from other films released at the same time, the quality of the script, the quality of the cast, the quality of the director and other parties, etc. Even if a film looks like it will be a commercial success \\"on paper\\", there is still no accurate method of determining the levels of revenue the film will generate. In the past, risk mitigation was based on pre-sales, box office projections and ownership of negative rights. Along with strong ancillary markets in DVD, cable television, and other electronic media such as SVOD, or streaming video on demand), investors were shown that picture subsidies (tax incentives and credits), and pre-sales (discountable-contract finance) from foreign distributors, could help to mitigate potential losses. As production costs have risen, however, potential financiers have become increasingly insistent upon higher degrees of certainty as to whether they will actually have their investment repaid, and assurances regarding what return they will earn. Past film slate's poor performance records are showing up in public court documents. Property and casualty companies (P&C;) like AIG had offered insurance against film slates and the bonds issued to fund them, but now fully refuse to cover film slates. This ended in many lawsuits, starting in early 1999 (with Steve Stabler's Destination Films $100 million bond fund failure and subsequent lawsuit), and continue to this day with Aramid's lawsuit on Relativity's Beverly-1-Sony film slate and the Melrose-2-Paramount slate. Citigroup attempted to wrap the Beverly-1-Sony slate with a property and casualty insurance wrapper (from the formerly bankrupt Ambac Assurance, Corp.). After these \\"uninsured\\" slate financing arrangements (SFA) failed to return even the original principal to investors, the market has sought solutions. Traditionally, banks like JP Morgan have an entertainment division that uses proprietary risk mitigation regression analysis to see if future film revenues can meet an exceedance probability (where in the ultimate revenues allow the loan to break even), but this is calculated guesswork, and has caused all of the major national banks to lose millions in bad loans. An alternative to such loss protection was developed by Geneva Media Holdings, LLC (originally as risk mitigation for affluent individuals and \\"direct investors\\" under U.S. tax incentive IRC 181). Fully insured media funds are now being carefully reviewed by risk analysts at major hedge funds, banks and institutional pension plans specializing in investor risk mitigation. Many outside of Hollywood fail to realize the longevity of film and television after-market income streams. Many commercial films and network television shows will make money for decades. For the investor who pays for part of the negative costs, the time value of money is important. For many movie investors the required rate of return for this \\"risky\\" investment may be 25% or more. This means that while there may be TV revenues for an additional ten years after the movie is released, the PV (present value) of those revenues is diminished by the required rate of return and the time it takes for these revenues to accrue. Ancillary revenues (VOD, DVD, Blu-ray, PPV, CATV, etc.), tend to accrue to the studio that purchased these residuals as part of their overall distribution deal. For many movie investors in the past, the theatrical box office was the primary place to gain a PV return on their investment. VaultML has developed technologies usually seen in high-frequency trading to predict box office success and investor risk using artificial intelligence. They claim to analyze over 300,000 elements from screenplay to form a basis for prediction. Based on their published future predictions for 2015 they out yielded the market on a return on investment basis. Ryan Kavanaugh of Relativity Media offered participation in profits to actors, rather than up-front fees, to lower production costs and keep profits protected. Kavanaugh has attempted to use data from major studios like Sony and NBC/Universal to build a complex Monte Carlo system to determine movie failure rates prior to production. His projects and business models have failed miserably, resulting in $500 million in losses. The box office results of his movies have been mixed, as there is no set ratios, blends, mixtures, method or secret crystal ball that can project movie revenues, investor risk, or rejection parameters. Slated is the first dedicated online film finance marketplace for professional equity investing. Combined with Slated's team, script and financial analysis, investors can have ownership in films. Epagogix has developed a system using neural networks to assess factors that contribute to box office success. They assess a wide variety of movies of different box office returns. Another film finance analyst, Steve Jasmine, claims to have developed a system for predicting a film's box office success. This system claims to quantify 800 creative elements of billion dollar grossing movies to determine what audiences are most interested in. Worldwide Motion Picture Group offers a service termed \\"script evaluation\\" where a team of analysts compare draft scripts to those of previously released movies in an effort to estimate the box office potential of the proposed script. They also conduct surveys and use results of previous focus groups to assist this analysis.\\"Solving Equation of a Hit Film Script, With Data\\", The New York Times, May 5, 2013.

They broke up in 2009. The band quickly began attracting interest from several record labels and in March 2006 signed to V2 Records, later parting ways in November 2007. Their fifth single, \\"Sexy in Latin\\" was released on 22 January and became their highest charting single. The band made extensive use of the Internet to gather a fanbase. Like many other up and coming bands they made use of MySpace as well as their own forum to communicate with and co-ordinate fans. History=Formation Jon Windle and Edward 'Maz' Marriott were in several bands together from the age of 15 in Sheffield, and their first gig together was at St Timothy's Church Hall in Crookes. This was followed up by several other low key gigs in friends bedrooms and garages. Little Man Tate were originally formed as a 4 piece band by singer/guitarist Jon Windle, guitarist Edward 'Maz' Marriott, drummer Mike Balkow and former lead singer Simon Barnes in 1998 under the name Carousel Moon. The band changed their name to The Moon on 15 October 2001 which remained in place until 2005. Then came a transitional period for the band as they briefly changed their name to Lazy Eye before finally becoming Little Man Tate in September 2005. The band line up had also changed over the early years, following the departures of original lead singer Simon Barnes, and drummer Mike Balkow, who was replaced by Dan Fields. In an interview, Jon Windle revealed the name Little Man Tate came when he was on the telephone to bass player Ben Surtees, and was trying to think of a band name. He saw the film Little Man Tate advertised in the television listing, and they settled on that. Touring, V2 and debut album (2005-2007) The band began touring together in September 2005. Their first single, \\"The Agent\\", was released 6 March 2006 on 7\\" vinyl with \\"Just Can't Take It\\" as the B-side. All 1,800 copies sold out as pre-orders. The back of the record sleeve featured 273 usernames of members of the band's forum. The song was rated 9/10 by Teletext's Planet Sound. \\"The Agent\\" was Number 6 in Planet Sound's top 50 singles of 2006. The band played acoustic sets at several HMV stores around the UK to promote the single. It reached number 117 in the official UK Singles Chart on sales of the 7\\" vinyl alone. In April 2006, the band toured the UK. The band's second single, \\"What? What You Got?\\" was released on 22 May 2006, and reached number 40 in the UK Singles Chart, and was first played by DJ Phil Beckett on 96.2 The Revolution and not by Steve Lamacq on BBC 6 Music. Both \\"The Agent\\" and \\"What? What You Got?\\" were released under the band's own label, Yellow Van Records, a tribute to their old yellow van which was stolen along with all their equipment at an early gig at Fibbers (Barfly) in York. In June 2006, Little Man Tate played their first festival at the Middlesbrough Music Live in Middlesbrough, UK. In August 2006, they played the Reading and Leeds Festivals on the Carling Stage. On 26 August 2006, the band released their third single \\"House Party at Boothy's\\". The track reached number 29 in the official UK Singles Chart The band's fourth single, \\"Man I Hate Your Band\\", was released on 13 November 2006. It charted at number 26 in the UK Singles Chart. On 22 January 2007, the band released their fifth single \\"Sexy In Latin\\" one week prior to the release of their debut album. The track became the band's first top 20 single when it charted at number 20 in the UK Singles Chart. The band's debut album, About What You Know was released on 29 January 2007 and reached number 27 in the UK Albums Chart. The next single to be released was \\"This Must Be Love\\" on 26 March 2007. The single reached number 33 in the UK Singles Chart. The music video for the track starred veteran British actress Liz Smith. On 18 July 2007, the band released two new tracks \\"Suicide Tuesday\\" and \\"Trouble With Detox\\" free on NME.com. The band played the Main Stage of the Reading and Leeds Festivals on 24 & 25 August 2007. The band released their seventh single, \\"European Lover\\" on 27 August 2007, a re- recorded version of the same track that featured on their debut album, About What You Know. The single was not chart eligible as the single included a sticker advertising a competition to win tickets for the band's forthcoming Christmas gig in Blackpool at the Empress Ballroom. It was reported on 11 August 2007 that the band's record label V2 Records had been bought out by Universal. The band were subsequently dropped by V2 in November 2007, along with a large number of the rest of V2's roster of acts. It was during this time that the band announced they would release their eighth single 'Boy In The Anorak' prior to being released by V2. Promotional copies of the single were sent out and the track was made available to purchase temporarily on iTunes, however at the last minute the single was cancelled. The band gave away free copies of the single at a Blackpool Empress Ballroom gig and it was made available to download from their website on Christmas Day. Second album (2008-2009) On 2 June 2008, the band released their eighth single, \\"What Your Boyfriend Said\\", which was the first to be taken from their second album Nothing Worth Having Comes Easy. The track reached number 60 in the UK Singles Chart. The band released their ninth single \\"Hey Little Sweetie\\" on 8 September 2008. The track reached number 142 in the UK Singles Chart. On 15 September 2008, the band released their second album, Nothing Worth Having Comes Easy, which reached number 80 in the UK Albums Chart. In November 2008, a list of BNP members was leaked on the internet which caused a case of mistaken identity when on the list appeared a Jon Windle of Sheffield. The NME verified that it was not Windle of Little Man Tate. The band then released a statement saying \\"We would like to assure our fans that the Jon Windle that has appeared on the leaked list of BNP members is not the band's vocalist. Jon has never associated himself with the BNP in any form.\\" Little Man Tate released their tenth single, \\"I Am Alive\\", on 23 March 2009 on 7\\" vinyl and digital download only, and it was the band's final release. Break up On 13 July 2009, Little Man Tate announced their decision to split up after four years. They performed two final sell-out shows at the O2 Academy in Sheffield on 2 and 3 October 2009 to over three thousand people. After Little Man Tate Edward Marriott was a session musician in London, following the band's split. As of March 2010, he toured with singer Jay Brown and Dusso & The Holy Smokes. He is now working as a music teacher in North London. Ben Surtees was DJing and working on Hospital radiointerview with Ben on BBC Radio Sheffield's Raw Talent in February 2010 After LMT, Jon Windle released two solo albums, Step Out The Man in October 2010, and Sober Minds in May 2012. He continued to tour, performing both solo acoustic shows as well as full band concerts until December 2013 when he announced his retirement with a sold-out show at Sheffield City Hall on the 22nd of December. Windle is now involved in music management, working with a variety of different bands in the indie and rock genres across the UK. Reunion concerts On 9 March 2020 a new Facebook page, apparently set up by the band, appeared under the name LittleManTateOfficial followed by a cryptic post that simply read \\"Somethings Happening\\" a reference to one of the band's biggest hits, \\"Sexy In Latin\\". Shortly after Twitter and Instagram accounts, also using LittleManTateOfficial surfaced, again appearing to be set up by the band, fuelling speculation in both the local and national music press that they were about to reform. On 24 March 2020, the band released a post across all social media platforms stating that an announcement would be made on 14 April, along with the #somethingshappening moniker. On 14 April, after nearly five weeks of speculation, the band announced that a one off reunion show would be taking place at O2 Academy Sheffield on 18 September. On 22 April, following high levels of demand for pre-sale tickets (selling out in less than 45 minutes), the band announced a second date at O2 Academy Sheffield on 19 September 2020. Due to the Covid19 outbreak, and the effect on live music as a whole, the band were forced to announce the reunion dates being rescheduled to April 2021.

He was a right-arm fast-medium bowler who moved the ball off the seam and became among the most effective bowlers in English county cricket during the 1970s. Presumably because his batting was impotent as shown by his highest first-class score in more than 200 matches being 26, Lee appears never to have been considered seriously for Test cricket. He toured South Africa twice with teams organised by Derrick Robins. Lee played for five seasons from 1967 for Northamptonshire without ever becoming a regular in the side. He moved to Lancashire in 1972 largely as insurance for the likelihood that regular opening bowlers Peter Lever and Ken Shuttleworth would be called up for Test cricket by England, but with those bowlers doing extremely badly, Lee became their first choice opening bowler. 1973 saw Lee massively surpass his first season‚Äôs promise and become the mainstay of Lancashire‚Äôs bowling, actually taking more wickets in the County Championship than any other bowler.Bowling by Wickets in County Championship 1973 In 1974 Lee was consistently handicapped by injuries and illness: he played about half his county‚Äôs matches but was at no point fully fitPreston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers‚Äô Almanac, 112th Edition (1975); pp. 456-460 Nevertheless, he returned for a full season and even greater success in 1975. His 112 first-class wickets was the highest by any bowler that season: indeed the highest by any England-qualified bowler during the 1970s. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 1976 edition of the almanack. Having reached the top of the tree as a bowler, Peter Lee remained one of the most persistent and hard-working county bowlers during 1976 and 1977, though he took only two-thirds as many wickets as he did in 1975. However, 1978 saw Lee play only one match due to a serious shoulder injury which led to a delayed operation after weeks of examination.Preston, Norman, MBE (editor); Wisden Cricketers‚Äô Almanac, 116th Edition (1979); p. 437 Lee made a \\"gallant\\" return to fitness in 1979 but completely lost form, finishing with 22 wickets for 40 runs apiece that season. Indeed, apart from a career-best eight for 34 against Oxford University in 1980,Oxford University v Lancashire in 1980 Lee never again did much worthy of his former reputation, and at the end of 1982 he was released by Lancashire. After that, he played for Durham in the Minor Counties Championship during the 1983 season, but took only sixteen wickets for 29.56 apiece and was released. During the 20/20 Finals Day in August 2011, Paul Allott suggested Lee‚Äôs decline coincided with the total loss of his run up, similar to the yips suffered mainly by left arm spinners.

Life and career=Early life and education Phillips was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and attended Manchester High School in Mandeville, Jamaica, before his family relocated to Washington, D.C., in the United States, where he graduated from high school. He then moved to the United Kingdom in the 1960s and in 1969 attended Rose Bruford College drama school,. Work After drama school Anton Phillips began an acting career in Britain that broke many racial barriers, appearing as the first black actor in many TV series, including General Hospital, The Saint, The Bill, and becoming best known as a cast member of Space 1999. His professional life has been dedicated to the promotion of black theatre and to that end Phillips started a number of projects that significantly changed the profile of black and Asian theatre in Britain.\\"Biography ‚Äì Anton Phillips\\" , Historical Geographies, 23 September 2011. These included the Carib Theatre Company (formed with Yvonne Brewster in 1980),\\"Carib Theatre Company\\" , Black Plays Archive, National Theatre. the Black Theatre Season,\\"Black Theatre Season\\" , Black Plays Archive, National Theatre. and the Black Theatre Forum, initiatives that were responsible for giving opportunities to many black and Asian writers, actors and theatre technicians.Alda Terracciano, \\"Mainstreaming Africa, Asian and Caribbean Theatre: The Experiments of the Black Theatre Forum\\" , Chapter One in Dimple Godiwala (ed.), Alternatives Within the Mainstream: British Black and Asian Theatres, Cambridge Scholars Press, 2006, pp. 22‚Äì60. Under his direction, Carib Theatre's production of The Amen Corner by James Baldwin was the first black-produced and directed play to transfer to the West End of London, an important theatre area.Terry Stoller, Tales of the Tricycle Theatre , Methuen Drama, 2013, pp. 45‚Äì48. Phillips directed a revival of the play, again at The Tricycle, in 1999.John Heathcote, \\"The Amen Corner\\" (review) , Flame, 2000. Major productions have included Remembrance by Derek Walcott, and Sitting in Limbo ‚Äî a play written by Phillips's then wife, actress Judy Hepburn (about Phyllis Coard and the Grenada Revolution), Juwon Ogungbe, \\"Sitting In Limbo\\" , Black Perspective online magazine. which played in London and toured to Jamaica. Carib Theatre also specialised in theatre in education, and toured schools across London for several years, playing to some 30,000 children. The Black Theatre Season significantly changed the profile of black and Asian theater in Britain. Before the first season, which started in 1983 at the Arts Theatre in London‚Äôs West End, black theatre was largely relegated to draughty church halls and rooms in community centres on the outskirts of cities. However, now black and Asian plays were presented in legitimate theatres with all their facilities of sound, light and comfort. As season followed season for seven years, companies, writers and actors were accorded prominence and respect within the profession and the wider society.Monica Pinnock, Tribune Magazine, 23 February 1990. Phillips has also worked for the British Council in Ghana, where in 1994 he directed Trevor Rhone's Old Story Time as the first major production at the newly built National Theatre.James Gibbs, Nkyin-kyin: Essays on the Ghanaian Theatre, Cross/Cultures 98, Readings in the Post- Colonial Literatures in English, Rodopi, 2009, p. xxiii. Phillips also lectured at the School of Performing Arts, University of Ghana, and for three years was a consultant for the British Council on a special project in Tanzania to create a company of performers and teach them the principals and practice of theatre in education. He has directed in Germany, the Netherlands, and France. He has also managed a 60-strong company of singers, dancers, and musicians from South Africa on a touring tribute to Oliver Tambo that was presented at the Barbican Centre in London and at Salisbury Cathedral, England. Inspired by the Area Youth Foundation of Kingston, Jamaica, Phillips founded the Stonebridge Area Youth Project (SAY), a performance-based project for disaffected young people between the ages of 14 and 24 based in Stonebridge, a London housing estate.\\"Carib Theatre Company\\" , Brent Council. Through performing arts workshops, SAY encouraged youths to re-engage with society by going back into education and learning life-skills to help them into employment.

Widely considered by the media to be one of Toyota's worst flops, the experiment provided the foundation for Toyota's Scion marque. The endeavors of this approach were also used in the home market of Japan. The Japanese market efforts were the result of several Japanese companies contributing products or services under the WiLL brandname, and Toyota's contribution was three vehicles offered at restructured Toyota Japanese sales channels from Toyota Vista Store to Toyota Netz Store. Launched in 1999, Project Genesis was a task force formed by Yoshimi Inaba, president of Toyota Motor Sales USA and James Press, COO of TMS. They intended to take three new products which were about to be introduced and sell them as a \\"marque within a marque\\" through Toyota's United States and Japanese dealer network. The cars, the Celica, MR2 Spyder, and Echo, would be bundled together and advertised differently from other Toyota models. At the time, in America, these vehicles were in segments that were shrinking and not necessarily considered typical youth segments. Regardless, the parent company in Japan challenged Toyota USA to market these existing products as \\"youth\\" vehicles. The Toyota ECHO was a global vehicle sold in Asia and Europe under the name Yaris. It attracted young American buyers in the first year of its launch, but the average age would creep up in subsequent years. The ECHO has since been replaced by the global brand Yaris nameplate. The MR2 Spyder, named the MR-S in Japan, did not sell very well either, as it was believed to be impractical for younger generation buyers. Little storage room, low seating capacity, and other problems are common to two seater convertibles, but they are inconvenient when it's the owner's only car. Another problem was the important restrictions imposed on Toyota; these caused severe dealer markups and made the car less accessible to younger buyers. The MR2 Spyder did at least sell well with the tuner market and older demographics. The Celica, on the other hand, was at first successful with younger buyers. In 2000, its first model year being sold under the 'Project Genesis' marque, sold over 65,000 units. Sales started to trail off towards it final 2005 model year, in which only 15,000 units were sold. In later years the Toyota Matrix was added to the 'Project Genesis' lineup. With a limited budget, minimal product input, and strong internal political resistance, Genesis struggled to make the enduring marketing impact it set out to accomplish for the launch of these three vehicles. Hence came Toyota's 'Project Exodus'. In 2001, Genesis was officially brought to a close by the announcement that Toyota Motor Sales USA decided to launch a separate marque, Scion, a move known as 'Project Exodus'. Scion's success can be directly attributed to the lessons learned from the Genesis experience and struggles. There was also a specific website dedicated to the project named \\"isthistoyota\\" and had a change in rhetoric to appeal to the younger buyers. This site now redirects to the Toyota USA site.

The society is dedicated to the preservation and restoration of the remaining Class 55 \\"Deltic\\" diesel locomotives operated by British Rail from the 1960s to the 1980s. Formation The Deltic Preservation Society (DPS) was founded in 1977 following the entry into service of the Class 43 High Speed Train. A group of Class 55 enthusiasts made the decision to join together to ensure that a working locomotive was kept running, forming the DPS to raise funds to this end. By 1982, when the Class 55 was withdrawn, the Society numbered over 1,500, with the result that it was able to purchase two locomotives, D9009/55009 (Alycidon) and D9019/55019 (Royal Highland Fusilier), from British Rail. These two units were moved immediately from Doncaster Works and put into service on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. A third locomotive, D9015/55015 (Tulyar) was added to the inventory in 1986 when it was purchased from a private owner. For the first few years, the DPS provided its locomotives to run on a number of private railways. However, following a change of policy by British Rail in 1991, a few years before its privatisation, it became possible for private operators to run trains on the mainline rail network. With this in mind, the DPS sent Alycidon for a major overhaul, completed in 1998, which allowed the locomotive to gain a certification for running on the public railway. Royal Highland Fusilier was given a less extensive overhaul, receiving its certification at the same time. Both locomotives re-entered passenger service in May 1999, operating railtour services for the Society. At the same time, both were also used on many occasions by Venice-Simplon Orient Express to haul the Northern Belle charter train. In 1997, Tulyar was withdrawn from its private railway services and sent for an overhaul along the same lines as Alycidon to restore it to mainline service. Royal Scots Grey D9000/55022 Royal Scots Grey is a further preserved Class 55. Along with D9016/55016 Gordon Highlander, she was purchased by the Deltic 9000 Fund on withdrawal from British Rail service, and operated for several years on charters and railtours. In 2004, DNLL went into liquidation, with its locomotives sold. Royal Scots Grey was purchased by DPS member Martin Walker to be operated as a chartered locomotive for railtour operators. In 2009 Walker purchased Gordon Highlander reuniting the two locomotives. The two locomotives ran at the East Lancashire Railway for many years however have now both left for other railways. In December 2017, both were sold to Locomotive Services Limited.Two Deltics sold to Locomotive Services Today's Railways UK issue 193 January 2018 page 67 Operations Under the name 'DPS Railtours, the DPS operated railtours pulled by its Class 55 locomotives. It has also provided its locomotives to other railtour operators for their services. In addition, under the name DPS Commercial Services, the DPS operates a depot at Barrow Hill near Chesterfield, where it contracts out to perform maintenance and repairs not only its own locomotives, but also the other preserved Class 55s, D9002/55002 (King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry) (owned by the National Railway Museum) and D9000/55022 (Royal Scots Grey).Deltic Preservation Society opens depot at Barrow Hill Rail issue 471 1 October 2003 page 26 In addition, the DPS also owns a preserved cab of D9008/55008 (The Green Howards), which has been converted into a simulator for the Trainz East Coast Main Line computer program. In August 2006, the DPS also obtained the cab of D9021/55021 (Argyll and Sutherland Highlander), which it intends to restore and put on display at its depot however the cab has now left the DPS depot and is now part of The South Wales Loco Cab Preservation Group.

This is the second animated series produced by the studio, and the first by Rankin/Bass to feature traditional animation. Summary The series features stories derived from characters created in L. Frank Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Several characters are given additional names, including Dandy the Cowardly Lion, Rusty the Tin Man, and Socrates the Scarecrow. In this adaptation, rather than being dropped by a tornado, Dorothy and Toto are blown in from Kansas through a hole cut out of the landscape. Each episode is a brief vignette about an adventure that the characters are involved in, often centering around the Wizard's attempts to fulfill the characters' wishes. Artistic renditions of the Oz characters created for this series were later featured in the hour-long television special Return to Oz. The series was also adapted to a comic book for a one-shot issue in Dell's Four Color #1308 (March‚ÄìMay 1962). , this series has yet to be released on DVD. Coincidentally, both this series and Filmation's own animated project, Journey Back to Oz (which began production one year later and was ultimately finished in 1971), are now owned by the same company, Universal Studios. In October 2010, the series went into rotation on the Retro Television Network.

From 1951 to 1965, he was president of the Ritter Company, a dental chair manufacturer founded by his grandfather Frank Ritter, and later led the company's successor, the Sybron Corporation. The Ritter line was later bought from Sybron by Midmark, and the line is still being sold today. In 1955, Shumway founded the Genesee Figure Skating Club after becoming active (and setting records) in the over-35 category of figure skating competition. Needing a place to train, he donated money to the Rochester Institute of Technology to add an ice rink to its downtown Rochester campus. The ice rink was later named for Shumway. When RIT was forced to move in the mid-1960s, he ensured that the new Henrietta campus would also have an ice arena. The new rink, the Frank Ritter Memorial Ice Arena, was named for Shumway's grandfather, a founder of one of RIT's forerunners, the Mechanics Institute. The Genesee Figure Skating Club also moved to the new arena when it was built in 1968. The Shumway arena was also home to the Rochester Ice Cats, a special needs hockey team. The Ice Cats had home games and practices at the arena. Now, they have their practices and home games at Bill Gray's Regional Iceplex. Shumway became president of the United States Figure Skating Association in 1961, shortly before the entire U.S. figure skating team, with coaches and family, died in the crash of Sabena Flight 548 (15 February 1961). Shumway was instrumental in uniting the figure skating community in its grief and providing an outlet for that grief, in the form of the USFSA Memorial Fund. Shumway said in September of that year: \\"We will take our Memorial Fund a giant skating stroke forward toward our goal of perpetuating the memory of our gallant 1961 World Team skaters, not so much by statuary and plaques, as by giving us the means to assist talented young skaters ‚Äî many of them yet 'undiscovered' ‚Äî to get started, to develop and advance, and eventually to represent our country in future years, and to be ranked at the top of the world in the art of figure skating.\\" Shumway and his wife, Hettie (n√©e Lakin), were generous donors to RIT. Hettie Shumway is the namesake of one of RIT's dining halls. Shumway was inducted into the U.S. and World Figure Skating Hall of Fames in 1986. He continued ice skating until just months before his death in 1992.

Native to Southeast Asia, it is commonly used in freshwater aquariums. It attaches to rocks, roots, and driftwood. The identity of this well-known plant is not resolved; formerly thought to be Vesicularia dubyana (Brotherus, 1908), it may actually be Taxiphyllum barbieri (Cardot & Copp.) Z. Iwats.Tan, B. C., Loh, K. L., & Gan, C. W. (2005): A case of mistaken identity? What is the true identity of Java Moss and other aquarium mosses sold in Singapore shops? Singapore Scientist, 102: 8-11 It was originally described as Isopterygium barbieri Cardot & Copp. from Vinh, Vietnam.Type of Isopterygium barbieri Cardot & Copp. Java moss does not require any special attention. It accepts all kinds of water, even weakly brackish, and all kinds of light qualities. It grows best at 70 to 75¬∞ Fahrenheit (21 to 24¬∞ Celsius), but can live in temperatures of up to 85 to 90 ¬∞F (29 to 32 ¬∞C). It makes a good foreground plant. In aquariums it should be planted where there is good water current because debris gets stuck on it easily and gives it a brown fuzzy appearance. Due to its clinging nature, Java moss can also be made into a moss wall. This can be accomplished by folding a net and spreading the moss evenly across it. Then, the net can be secured together by polyester strings, and held on the aquarium wall by using suction cups. It is a slow starter until it has established itself. It is especially popular among aquarists raising fry (baby fish) and tadpoles, to protect them from cannibalistic adults. Java moss can also provide food for the newly formed fry, which can be challenging to feed. Some shrimp like to feed on the miniature leaf like structures known as phyllids. Another benefit for newly formed fry from Java Moss is increased oxygen levels in the aquarium water.https://sonsfish.com/library/freshwater-helpful- guides/java-moss-carpet/ Java moss can be easily propagated via division. It is suitable for both aquariums and vivariums.

Delivery system A control within the car can be operated to spray washer fluid onto the windshield, typically using an electrical pump via jets mounted either beneath the windshield or beneath the wiper blade(s). The windshield wipers are automatically turned on, cleaning dirt and debris off the windshield. Some vehicles use the same method to clean the rear window or the headlights. The first windshield cleaner unit offered for automobiles was in 1936, as an aftermarket option to be installed on cars after they were bought. Washer fluid may sometimes be preheated before being delivered onto the windshield. This is especially desirable in colder climates when a thin layer of ice or frost accumulates on the windshield's surface, as it eliminates the need to manually scrape the windshield or pour warm water on the glass. Although there are a few aftermarket preheat devices available, many automobile makers offer this feature factory installed on at least some of their vehicles. For example, General Motors had begun equipping vehicles with heated washer fluid systems from the factory beginning in 2006 with the Buick Lucerne sedan. The system emits a fine mist of heated water that clears frost without damaging the windshield itself. GM also claims heated washer fluid helps in removing bug splatters and other road accumulation. The company halted the production of these mechanisms after they found that it was prone to start engine fires. Mercedes Benz has used a thermostatically controlled heating element, with the engine coolant as the heat source, since the mid 1980s on certain models. Many other manufacturers have employed electrically heated washer nozzles primarily to prevent them from freezing closed, not in an attempt to heat the fluid itself. Varieties Windshield washer fluid is sold in many formulations, and some may require dilution before being applied, although most solutions available in North America come premixed with no diluting required. The most common washer fluid solutions are given labels such as \\"All-Season\\", \\"Bug Remover\\", or \\"De-icer\\", and usually are a combination of solvents with a detergent. Dilution factors will vary depending on season, for example in winter, the dilution factor may be 1:1, whereas during summer the dilution factor may be 1:10. It is sometimes sold as sachet of crystals, which is also diluted with water. Distilled or deionised water is the preferred diluent, since it will not leave trace mineral deposits on the glass. Anti-freeze, or methylated spirits, may be added to a mixture to give the product a lower freezing temperature. Methanol vapor is harmful when breathed in, and methanol poisoning presents a risk of death, severe ocular toxicity, and other severe effects if ingested. As of May 9, 2018, methanol was banned from use in windscreen washing and defrosting products in the European Union. Fluids are now usually based on ethanol, often with small quantities of isopropanol, ethylene glycol, and methanol. Many cars display a warning when the fluid level is low, and some car makers have replaced the float sensor generating this signal with a simple two-pin probe in the tank. This requires a (slightly) conductive fluid, but most common windshield washer fluid mixtures will work. Mercedes-Benz sells a special fluid for their cars. Concerns have been raised about the overall environmental aspects of washer fluid. Widespread use of wiper fluid (amounting to billions of liters each year) can lead to cumulative air pollution and water pollution.. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) in particular has brought strong regulatory pressure on suppliers of windshield washer fluid, including measures to limit or ban the sale of \\"concentrated\\" fluids, out of concern that users will not sufficiently dilute the mixtures. Mercury News later wrote an article about the board‚Äôs action, entitled \\"Roadshow: California‚Äôs ban on low-temp windshield washer fluid.\\" Consumer advocacy groups and auto enthusiasts believe that the alcohols and solvents present in some, but not all, windshield washer fluid can damage the vehicle. These critics point to the corrosive effects of ethanol, methanol, and other components on paint, rubber, car wax, and plastics, and groups propose various alternatives and homemade recipes to protect the finish and mechanics of the motor vehicle. Legionnaires' disease On 14 June 2010, the UK's Health Protection Agency announced the results of a preliminary study of 75 patients, which found an association between the use of windshield washer fluid and Legionnaires' disease, which is spread by breathing in aerosolized bacteria. It had been noticed that prevalence of the disease was five times higher among professional drivers.

Behavior  It is nocturnal and carnivorous, consuming almost any small species of arthropod. They are found in semi-arid, rocky areas. They are capable of vocalizations, and sometimes will emit squeaking sounds if handled.  Conservation concerns  The reticulate banded gecko is listed as a threatened species in the state of Texas, as it only occurs in two counties, but its habitat is fairly remote and not easily accessible and is not under immediate threat. Also, part of its habitat is found within the protected confines of Big Bend National Park.

He was born in Bristol, and educated at Wallington County Grammar School (WCGS), a grammar school in Surrey, where he won prizes for his achievements in chemistry. From 1941 to 1946 he served in the wartime Royal Air Force as a Flight Lieutenant. In this capacity he served first in RAF Bomber Command, navigating Avro Lancasters, and later in one of the elite Pathfinder squadrons, such was his capacity to apply his understanding of mathematics to the task before him. After demobilisation, he returned to his studies, and the start of a long career at University College London. Gaining a First Class BSc in physics just two years later, he continued, obtaining his PhD on Quantal Calculations of certain reaction rates with applications to Astrophysical and Geophysical problems in 1951. He later did important work on the Quantum Defect Theory. With a break as Charg√© de Recherch√© at the Institut d'astrophysique de Paris from 1954‚Äì55, he rose through the ranks at the Department of Physics at UCL, becoming a Reader in 1959, and Professor of Physics in 1963. He was made a Fellow of the College in 1972, the year in which the Departments of Physics and Astronomy merged. He held the status of Professor Emeritus and Honorary Research Fellow from 1988 until his death. In 1964 he became Fellow-Adjoint at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA) in Boulder, Colorado, a combined venture between the American National Institute of Standards and Technology and the University of Colorado.

The institution was founded in 1859 by Queen Emma and King Kamehameha IV, and is located in Downtown Honolulu. Description Queen's is the largest private hospital in Hawai ªi, licensed to operate with 575 acute care beds. With 3,600 employees‚Äîincluding 1,160 nurses and over 1,100 physicians on staff‚Äîit is also one of the state of Hawai ªi's largest employers. It is a Level I trauma center and the only designated Level I trauma center in the state of Hawai ªi, and first Level I in the Pacific. It is located in downtown Honolulu, southwest of Interstate H-1. Queen's is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and affiliated with the Voluntary Hospitals of America (VHA). The medical center is also approved to participate in residency training by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. In 2009, The Queen's Medical Center achieved Magnet status from the American Nurses Credentialing Center. Magnet recognition is held by six percent of hospitals in the United States. Queen's is the first hospital in Hawai ªi to achieve Magnet status. The Queen's Medical Center is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit corporation. Core operation=Patient care As the leading medical referral center in the Pacific Basin, Queen's is widely known for its programs in cancer, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, orthopedics, surgery, trauma, behavioral medicine and women's health. Queen's offers a comprehensive range of specialties, including gastroenterology, genetics, geriatrics, gynecology, neonatology, obstetrics, psychiatry, pulmonology, and radiology. It is one of the few hospitals in the state with both a 24-hour emergency psychiatry consultation service and a busy yet robust consultation-liaison service. Kekela is the 20-bed acute adult inpatient psychiatric unit, and the Family Treatment Center is Queen's child and adolescent psychiatry inpatient unit supporting acute and residential beds with up to 20 patients at any one time. Outpatient care at Queen's is available through Queen Emma Clinics, a primary care clinic with a focus on the uninsured and underinsured. Queen's is the only Level I trauma center in Hawaii verified by the American College of Surgeons. Partnerships Queen's Health Systems (QHS) has partnered with many organizations in order to improve patient care and the medical work environment. By partnering with the John A. Burns School of Medicine Department of Native Hawaiian Health, they have funded positions at Queen's hospital, such as adding a psychologist, that allow for a diverse interdisciplinary team in the surgery room. By doing so, this has provided improvements in team communication, interaction, and ultimately effectiveness. In 2015, the Queen's Medical Center began a collaborative affiliation with the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality in order to improve patient safety and quality healthcare improvement programs. Philanthropy Queen's Health Systems (QHS) has been a major pillar of financial support for many various organizations in the State of Hawai ªi. Since 2002, QHS has donated approximately $10 million to the University of Hawai ªi Native Hawaiian Health programs, as of 2016. The funds are aimed to address the disproportionately high occurrences of illness in the Native Hawaiian population. The funds are distributed to many other programs that push to eliminate these disparities. Among these programs is the  ªImi Ho ª≈çla Post-Baccalaureate Program. QHS provides stipends to the current students for financial support throughout their tenure in the program.  ªImi Ho ª≈çla aims to recruit those who are interested in medicine and who may have come from disadvantaged backgrounds. These participants who complete the program are able to matriculate into the John A. Burns School of Medicine. Many of the  ªImi Ho ª≈çla graduates end up serving underserved communities all throughout the Pacific and beyond, making it one of the most successful programs in the country for recruiting future physicians in rural communities. Not only do the funds go to programs, but also in efforts to help policy makers in Hawai ªi to create important policies and documents that address the needs of those within the Native Hawaiian community among the islands. These policies pave the way into making administrative change that ultimately allow for improvements in the health of Native Hawaiians. Education The Queen's Medical Center serves as the primary teaching hospital for most of the residency programs sponsored by the University of Hawai ªi at Manoa John A. Burns School of Medicine. It also serves as one of the clinical training sites for medical students completing their third-year clinical clerkship, electives and sub-internships. Queen Emma Clinics is also partnered with the University of Hawai ªi at Manoa John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) to provide medical students and resident physicians clinical training and education. In 1999, Queen Emma Clinics and JABSOM successfully piloted the joint JABSOM School Health Education Program (SHEP) as part of first year medical students' community medicine and service- learning curriculum. This program is facilitated by first year medical students and aims to educate local public high school students about relevant health care topics, such as drug use, sexual health, alcohol, diet, and exercise. The program also seeks to promote medical student involvement in community service, academics, and health promotion. In 2019, Queen's Health Systems announced a partnership with Kapi ªolani Community College (KCC) to offer a joint 12-month medical assisting program. The program offers free tuition for 26 Hawai ªi residents and the students will gain hands-on experience at The Queen's Medical Center while they attend classes at KCC. The program was created in response to the shortage of medical professionals in Hawai ªi. Scholarships Along with their financial philanthropy for programs and policies, another notable donation is towards scholarships. Many of the scholars are in efforts to support the Native Hawaiian Health Initiative that involves supporting healthcare training via scholarships and training assistance. In 2007, QHS donated $25,000 towards scholarships for a variety of health programs at the Kapi ªolani Community College. In efforts to support beyond physicians, pharmacists, and nurses, these funds go toward health programs such as the radiologic technology program. History The Queen's Hospital in 1905 In King Kamehameha IV's initial speech to the legislature in January 1855, the King proposed creating a hospital for the people of Hawaii. At that time, the continued existence of the Hawaiian race was seriously threatened by the influx of disease brought to the islands by foreign visitors. A smallpox epidemic in 1853 had killed thousands of the dwindling population. French-American physician Charles Guillou proposed building a public hospital in April 1858. When Emma's adoptive father Dr. Thomas Rooke died in 1858, all his instruments were donated to the hospital effort. In January 1859 a committee of Robert Crichton Wyllie (a former physician) and David L Gregg was formed to plan the hospital investigate funding. Queen Emma enthusiastically supported the dream of a hospital, and the two campaigned to make it a reality. They personally went door-to-door soliciting the necessary funding. The royal couple exceeded their goal in just over a month, raising $13,530. In turn, the Legislature appropriated $6,000. The first hospital physician was William Hillebrand, who served until 1871. The site picked in 1860 was an area called Manamana owned by Caesar Kapaakea, patriarch of the House of KalƒÅkaua. The architect Theodore Heuck was selected for the first building. The name was changed to The Queen's Medical Center in 1967. The hospital was featured in two episodes of the television series Trauma: Life in the ER. Awards & recognition In 2009, the Queen's Medical Center became the first and only healthcare facility in Hawai ªi to become designated as a Magnet Recognized hospital by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC). They were redesignated in 2014. They were also awarded the Harold P. Freeman Service Award. Which was created originally in 1990 to recognize Mr. Freeman's advocacy in connecting relationships between cancer, race, and poverty. Queen's is recognized by the American College of Surgeons as a verified Level I Trauma Center. The Queen's Medical Center is also recognized as the first and only hospital in Hawai ªi to be affiliated with the MD Anderson Cancer Network to bring cancer patients in Hawai ªi access to advanced practices and treatment plans. The National Association of Epilepsy Centers (NAEC) has accredited the Queen's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center as a Level 4 Center. On January 9, 2017, the Queen's Medical Center has received The Joint Commission's Gold Seal of Approval for Advanced Certification for Comprehensive Stroke Centers by The Joint Commission, American Heart Association, and American Stroke Association.

It is also known as the Kaibab Formation in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The Kaibab Limestone forms the rim of the Grand Canyon. In the Big Maria Mountains, California, the Kaibab Limestone is highly metamorphosed and known as the Kaibab Marble. Nomenclature Grand Canyon view The rim top layer (North Rim), is the Kaibab Limestone Walnut Canyon, Flagstaff Arizona The Kaibab Limestone was named by Darton in 1910 for the Kaibab Plateau, which is on the north side of Grand Canyon in Coconino County, Arizona. In his definition of the Kaibab Limestone formation, no type locality was designated. He also designated the Kaibab Limestone as the upper formation of the Aubrey Group, a now-abandoned stratigraphic unit. In 1921, Bassler and Reeside revised Darton's work and defined the Harrisburg Member of the Kaibab Limestone.Bassler, H., and J. B. Reeside, Jr., 1921, Oil prospects in Washington County, Utah, Chapter C. in D. White and M. R. Campbell, eds., pp. C87-C107, Contributions to economic geology (short papers and preliminary reports), 1921, Part II.--Mineral fuels. Bulletin no. 726. U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia. In his 1938 monograph on the Toroweap Formation and Kaibab Limestone of northern Arizona,McKee, E. D., 1938, The environment and history of the Toroweap Formation and Kaibab formations of northern Arizona and southern Utah. Publication, no. 492. Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, DC. 268 pp. McKee split Darton's original Kaibab Limestone into the currently recognized Kaibab Limestone and Toroweap Formation. He also revised Kaibab Limestone's lower contact and divided it into informal (descending) alpha, beta and gamma members. Later in the 1970s, its upper contact was revised and its aerial extent were defined. Also, unsuccessful attempts were made to raise the formation to group rank and divide it into several formations. In 1982, Warren Hamilton renamed it as the Kaibab Marble and determined its areal extent for California.Hamilton, W. H., 1982, Structural evolution of the Big Maria Mountains, northeastern Riverside County, southeastern California. in E. G. Frost and D. L. Martin, eds., pp. 1-27, Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the Colorado River region, California, Arizona, and Nevada. Cordilleran Publishers, San Diego, California, United States. 608 pp. In 1991, Sorauf and Billingsley subdivided the Kaibab Limestone into (ascending) Fossil Mountain Member (new) and Harrisburg Member.Sorauf, J. E. and G. H. Billingsley, 1991, Members of the Toroweap and Kaibab Formations, Lower Permian, northern Arizona and southwestern Utah. The Mountain Geologist, 28(1):9-24. They designated the strata comprising McKee's alpha (or upper) member as the Harrisburg Member and the strata comprising McKee's beta (or middle) member as the Fossil Mountain Member. The Fossil Mountain Member was named for Fossil Mountain along the south rim near the Bass Trail. McKee's gamma member is considered to be part of the Fossil Mountain Member. Later research has further redefined the regional extent of the Kaibab Limestone. Description The Kaibab Limestone is an assemblage of sedimentary rock types. It consists of a complexity of inter fingering and inter bedded carbonate and siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. In addition, intense post-depositional (diagenetic) changes have created more composition variation by the alteration of limestone to dolomite and the silicification of limestone to form chert. In the western Grand Canyon region, the Fossil Mountain Member consists of fossiliferous and cherty limestone with an abundant and diverse normal-marine fossil fauna. Further east in the Coconino Plateau region, the lithology, mineralogy, and fauna of the Fossil Mountain Member changes drastically where it grades laterally into sandy dolomite and dolomite that contains a restricted-marine fossil fauna and subordinate amounts of sandstone. The Harrisburg Member, which forms the uppermost cliffs and receding ledges along both north and south rims of the Grand Canyon, consists of an assemblage of gypsum, dolomite, sandstone, redbeds, chert, and minor limestone. Contacts Within the Grand Canyon region, the Kaibab Limestone overlies gypsum and contorted sandstones of the Toroweap Formation. Originally, geologists interpreted the lower contact of the Kaibab Limestone to be an unconformity based on the presence of local intraformational breccias and erosional surfaces. However, additional research has concluded that these local intraformational breccias and erosional surfaces are the result of collapse following the dissolution of evaporite deposits within the upper part of the Toroweap Formation. As a result, this contact is inferred to be conformable or only locally a disconformity. South and east of the Grand Canyon, the evaporites and contorted sandstones (sabkha deposits) of Toroweap Formation interfinger with and are replaced by cross- bedded sandstones of the Coconino Sandstone. As a result, the Kaibab Limestone directly overlies the Coconino Sandstone in the Mogollon Rim region. The Kaibab Limestone directly overlies the White Rim Sandstone in northeastern Arizona and southeastern Utah. The upper contact of the Kaibab Limestone (Harrisburg Member) with the overlying Moenkopi Formation is an erosional unconformity and disconformity. Within northwestern Arizona, southeastern Nevada, and southwestern Utah this contact is an erosional unconformity that in part consists of paleovalleys, as much as several hundred feet deep, and paleokarst that were eroded into the underlying Kaibab Limestone before the deposition of the Moenkopi Formation. These paleovalleys are often filled with conglomerates and breccias that are known as the Rock Canyon conglomerate. Within the Marble Canyon and eastern Grand Canyon regions and south into Verde Valley, upper contact of the Kaibab Limestone with the Moenkopi Formation is an erosional disconformity. This disconformity exhibits little relief and is identified by marked differences in color, topography, and rock types between tan, ledge-forming, calcareous sandstones and of the Kaibab Limestone and red, slope-forming siltstones of the Moenkopi formation. The unconformity and disconformity are inferred to represent most of Permian time (including the Leonardian) and part of Early Triassic time. Although the Moenkopi Formation overlies the Kaibab Limestone, its redbeds have been removed almost entirely by erosion because they are less resistant to erosion than the strata of the Kaibab Formation. As a result, the Kaibab Limestone forms the surface of many of the vast plateaus that border the Grand Canyon. Within these plateaus, the uppermost beds of the Kaibab Limestone have also been largely removed by erosion. Fossils The Kaibab Limestone contains the abundant fossils of Permian invertebrates and vertebrates. The invertebrate fossils found within the Kaibab Limestone include brachiopods, conodonts, corals, crinoids, echinoid spines, mollusks, hexactinellid and other sponges, trilobites, and burrows of callanassid shrimp. The fossil cephalopods found in the Kaibab Limestone include giant football-sized nautiloids. Fossil shark teeth, which represent a diverse assemblage of chondrichthyans, occur within the Kaibab Limestone of Arizona.Hodnett, J.-P., D. K. Elliott, T. J. Olson, and J. H. Wittke, 2012, Ctenacanthiform sharks from the Permian Kaibab Formation, northern Arizona. Historical Biology. 24:1-15.Hodnett, J.-P., D. K. Elliott, and T. J.

Schneider, and J. S. Spielman, eds., pp. 103-108, The Carboniferous-Permian Transition. Bulletin no. 60. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, Socorro, New Mexico. Depositional environments The complex intercalation of carbonate and clastic sediments within the Kaibab Limestone reflects the deposition of sediments within a gently sloping continental margin during a period of frequent, high-frequency sea level changes. Relatively minor changes in sea level caused major lateral shifts in the position of supratidal, subtidal, and shallow-marine environments during the deposition of the Kaibab Limestone. The shifting sea levels and associated depositional environments created a complex interlayering of different types of carbonate and clastic sediments in the strata that comprise the Kaibab Limestone. The gently sloping continental margin on which the Kaibab Limestone accumulated, extended seaward from northern Arizona to southern Nevada, at times exceeding 200 miles (125 km) in width. It is most likely that the high-frequency changes in sea level were caused by glacial sea level oscillations during this time period. Age Early paleontological studies of the Kaibab Limestone firmly established its age on the basis of the abundant fossils that it and the underlying Toroweap Formation contain. On the basis of its brachiopod and siliceous sponge faunas, it was initially concluded that it is Leonardian (approximately Kungurian / latest Early Permian) in age.Griffen, L. R., 1966. Actinocoelia maendria Finks, from the Kaibab Limestone of Northern Arizona. Brigham Young University Geology Studies. 13:105-108. Later research concerning conodonts and associated megafossils obtained from western outcrops of the Fossil Mountain Member indicates that its age extends into the Roadian (latest Early Permian and earliest Middle Permian) age.Thompson, K.

Early career David Garrard was born Streatham on 12 January 1939, the son of a Stamford Hill upholsterer. He attended Battersea Grammar School in South London. Career Garrard left school at 16 and joined an estate agency. He co-founded Minerva PLC with Andrew Rosenfeld, a property investment and development company, whose shares are quoted in the London Stock Exchange FTSE 250 Index, and served as its chairman for many years until his retirement in March 2005. Before co-founding Minerva, Garrard worked as a financial adviser. In 2008, he set up a venture capital business with his son in law Alexander Salter, but the two fell out when Salter and Garrard's daughter divorced in 2013, leading to a High Court case. Garrard was listed by the Sunday Times Rich List 2005 as the joint 451st richest person in the UK, with a fortune in excess of ¬£100 million, falling to 575th with ¬£95 million in 2009. In 2014 Garrard was involved in a legal dispute with his former son-in- law related to an alleged attempted transfer of ¬£2.5 million from a bank account and the appointment of Lord Mendelsohn as a director of jointly owned companies. Political involvement=Labour Party In 2002 the first city academy under a new Labour programme, Business Academy Bexley (now Harris Garrard Academy) was opened by prime minister Tony Blair with Garrard as principal sponsor with a financial contribution of ¬£2.5 million. Garrard chaired its governing body. Before the 2005 General Election Garrard secretly provided the Labour Party with a loan of ¬£2.3 million at a time when loans on commercial terms did not have to be declared, to be repaid on 28 April 2007. Following the discovery of the loan in the course of the Cash for Honours political scandal in the UK, Garrard withdrew his nomination for a peerage. The loan was extended, and Gerrard eventually called for it to be repaid in 2015, in a reaction against the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party. In 2013, Garrard hosted a visit to Israel by eleven Labour MPs, including shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy, shadow defence minister Gemma Doyle, Labour Friends of Israel chair Anne McGuire and vice-chair Louise Ellman. He also sponsored the 2014 Labour Friends of Israel annual lunch, which included a speech by Labour leader Ed Miliband. In 2014, Garrard donated ¬£500,000 to the Labour party, one of the largest private donations under Ed Miliband's leadership. This prompted criticism of \\"double standards\\" when the media reported that Garrard had placed shares in an offshore trust to avoid tax, similar to Conservative donor and co-treasurer Lord Fink, whom Labour had criticised. Garrard left the Labour Party in March 2018 due to his unhappiness with the party's response to allegations of antisemitism. In February 2019, Garrard added that he had concerns about the nation's future should Corbyn lead the country. \\"From the very outset of Mr Corbyn‚Äôs leadership I had feared the ultra-Left Marxist/Socialist nature of the Labour party‚Äôs new leadership and its supporters, all of which led me to conclude that a socialist republic for our nation was what these politicians intend\\". After leaving the party, he has provided funding on several occasions to Tom Watson in addition to his support for The Independent Group. The Independent Group In February 2019 Garrard provided funding to support the launch of pro-EU political group The Independent Group; the amount as reported by The Sunday Telegraph was ¬£1.5 million. Honours Garrard was knighted in the 2003 New Year Honours. Charitable activities Garrard is a patron of children's charity Lifeline 4 Kids, is a trustee of the Police Foundation, and has been a director of the Princes Trust Business Division. Garrard donated ¬£2.4 million to the Bexley Business Academy (now known as the Harris Garrard Academy), a first- and second-level school, and chaired its governing body. The Business Academy Bexley was renamed the Harris Garrard Academy when it was taken over by the Harris Federation in 2017, to reflect the support Garrard had put into the academy. Personal life Garrard was married for forty-seven years to Maureen, who became a director of The Garrard Family Foundation and The Garrard Academy. She died in 2011. Garrard is Jewish.

United States  In the United States, there are more than thirty different religious emblems, each representing a different faith. A diverse selection of religious groups participate in the program, including denominations of Christianity and other Abrahamic religions, the Dharmic religions and Zoroastrianism. The religious emblems are \\"created by the various religious groups to encourage youth to grow stronger in their faith. The religious groups, not the youth organizations, have created the emblem programs themselves. Each religious organization develops and administers its own program.\\" Many religious groups have separate programs for different age levels within scouting, and some offer different programs or emblems for boys and girls. Some offer different programs or emblems for each youth organization. The youth organizations do not run the programs, and youth organization leaders do not guide the youths through the program unless they also are the youth's religious leader or mentor. The youth organizations can choose to decide whether the emblems of a particular religious program will be worn on the youth organization's uniforms. Once a youth has completed the program of their religion, they are usually presented with the emblem at a ceremony organized by their religious institution or the youth organization. The emblem is generally in the form of a medal, pin, or patch. Depending on the youth organization, the emblem can be worn only on formal or religious occasions, or may be worn all the time. Many of the religions also have awards for adult members; however, adult members are generally nominated by others for service to the religion within Scouting. A few religious organizations offer awards for adults who serve as leaders or mentors for youth earning the awards. In most cases, adults do not have a formal program to complete to earn an award. In the United States many, although not all, religious organizations with programs contract with the Programs of Religious Activities with Youth (P.R.A.Y.) business office to handle the mechanics of order processing. P.R.A.Y. itself develops and administers the God and Country program aimed at Protestant youth. P.R.A.Y. also promotes the religious emblems programs in general for all religions approved for scouting, both through lists and brochures distributed on the website and to scouting organizations, and through rotational segment patch programs designed to promote religious awards.  Boy Scouts of America  A variety of religious emblems programs approved by the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) are designed to encourage youth to learn about their faith and to recognize adults who provide significant service to youth in a religious environment. Under the promise of BSA, scout aim to be reverent. Boy Scouts who complete approved programs (workshops, with books fill in alongside with their denomination faith) . Boy scouts upon completion will earn a purple knot that it may also wear as the universal religious emblem knot insignia on the Scout uniform at all times. Participation in a program is not required, but encouraged although doing so is one method of completing some requirements for some Scout ranks. For instance Bronze award in Venturing Scouts and the TRUST MEDAL in Venturing as well. To promote religious awards within BSA, P.R.A.Y. offers a \\"Duty to God\\" rotational segment patch program for scouts and adults who attend or make a presentation about religious awards, then make a personal commitment to fulfill their \\"duty to God\\". This program is similar to the \\"To Serve God\\" GSUSA and \\"Love God\\" AHG programs.  Girl Scouts of the USA  In the Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) participation in a religious emblem program is optional and only a small percentage of Girl Scouts earn them. P.R.A.Y. has a list of religious emblems approved for Girl Scouts, but it is not considered exhaustive.  Camp Fire  In Camp Fire participation in a religious emblem program is optional. P.R.A.Y. has a list of religious emblems approved for Camp Fire members, but it is not considered exhaustive.  American Heritage Girls  As a Christian organization, the American Heritage Girls (AHG) approves of the Protestant God and Country program from P.R.A.Y., Members of Churches of Christ for Scouting (MCCS), as well as the Catholic programs available from the National Federation for Catholic Youth Ministry (N.F.C.Y.M.) and the Eastern Orthodox Program from P.R.A.Y approved by the Eastern Orthodox Committee on Scouting. Recognitions from other organizations, denominations, or religions are not approved for use with the organization.AHG Religious Recognitions To promote religious awards within AHG, P.R.A.Y. offers a \\"Love God\\" rotational segment patch program for girl scouts and adults who memorize the Biblical verses Mark 12:29-31, attend or make a presentation about religious awards, then make a personal commitment to \\"love God\\". This program is similar to the \\"Duty to God\\" BSA and \\"To Serve God\\" GSUSA programs.  Canada  Scouts Canada and Girl Guides of Canada offer the Religion in Life badge.

It is a complex enzyme that is found in brain, lung, and other tissues and especially in blood platelets and that functions in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin in the clotting of blood. Although sometimes used as a synonym for the protein tissue factor (with its official name \\"Coagulation factor III [thromboplastin, tissue factor]\\"), this is a misconception. Historically, thromboplastin was a lab reagent, usually derived from placental sources, used to assay prothrombin times (PT). When manipulated in the laboratory, a derivative could be created called partial thromboplastin. Partial thromboplastin was used to measure the intrinsic pathway. This test is called the aPTT, or activated partial thromboplastin time. It was not until much later that the subcomponents of thromboplastin and partial thromboplastin were identified. Thromboplastin is the combination of both phospholipids and tissue factor, both of which are needed in the activation of the extrinsic pathway. However, partial thromboplastin is just phospholipids, and not tissue factor. Currently, recombinant tissue factor is available and used in some PT assays. Placental derivatives are still available and are used in some laboratories. Phospholipid is available as an independent reagent or in combination with tissue factor as thromboplastin. Complete thromboplastin consists of tissue factor, phospholipids (since platelets were removed from blood sample being tested), and CaCl2 to reintroduce calcium ions which were chelated by sodium citrate originally used to prevent coagulation of the sample blood during transportation and/or storage.

Paul Whitehead is a British painter and graphic artist known for his surrealistic album covers for artists on the Charisma Records label in the 1970s, such as Genesis and Van der Graaf Generator. __TOC__ Life and work=England: Liberty Records and Charisma Records An art show in London in the mid-sixties led to Whitehead being picked up as an in-house artist for the London office of Jazz record label Liberty Records. Previously, he had been studying at the University of Oxford on an art scholarship.Interview with Jim Christopulos The first record cover he designed was for a repackaged Fats Domino album. This was followed by a series of work for other reissues for the UK market. In 1968, Whitehead became the original art director for Time Out in London magazine, which led him to further commissions for album covers. After a meeting with producer John Anthony, Whitehead was introduced to Tony Stratton-Smith, the founder of Charisma Records. Stratton-Smith introduced Whitehead to Genesis, and he was hired to do the cover to their 1970 album, Trespass. Charisma Records allowed Whitehead complete creative control over his work. Fruitful work in collaboration with Genesis, Van der Graaf Generator, Lindisfarne, and Peter Hammill followed at Charisma. Additionally, Whitehead is also credited as a performer on the Peter Hammill albums Fool's Mate (drums) and In Camera (percussion). United States In 1973, Whitehead moved to Los Angeles, where he continued to work on album covers as a freelancer. He is still most associated with progressive rock, and designed the 2000 logo for NEARfest. As a founder of the Eyes and Ears Foundation, he conceived of and organised the \\"Drive Though Art Gallery\\" Artboard Festival in February 1977, where artists painted on donated billboards.Eyes and Ears Foundation He has also created murals and designed corporate logos.

The granddaughter of the British naturalist Charles Darwin, Barlow began her academic career studying botany at Cambridge under Frederick Blackman, and continued her studies in the new field of genetics under William Bateson from 1904‚Äì1906. Her primary research focus when working with Bateson was the phenomenon of herostylism within the primrose family. In later life she was one of the first Darwinian scholars, and founder of the Darwin Industry of scholarly research into her grandfather's life and discoveries. She lived to 103.  Biography = Personal life  Nora, as she was known, was the daughter of the civil engineer Sir Horace Darwin and his wife The Hon. Lady Ida Darwin (n√©e Farrer), daughter of Thomas Farrer, 1st Baron Farrer. Her elder brother Erasmus was killed during the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915; She also had a sister, Ruth Darwin. In 1911 she married Alan Barlow, son of the Royal Physician Sir Thomas Barlow. They had six children: * Joan Helen Barlow (26 May 1912 ‚Äì 21 February 1954) * Sir Thomas Erasmus Barlow, 3rd Baronet. (23 January 1914 ‚Äì 12 October 2003), naval officer. * Erasmus Darwin Barlow (15 April 1915 ‚Äì 2 August 2005) * Andrew Dalmahoy Barlow (16 September 1916 ‚Äì 2006) * Hilda Horatia Barlow (14 September 1919-1 February 2017) married psychoanalyst John Hunter Padel; their daughter is the poet Ruth Padel. * Horace Basil Barlow (b. 8 December 1921 - 5 July 2020 ) Additionally, she temporarily cared for her cousin Gwen Raverat's daughters Elisabeth and Sophie during Gwen's breakdown after the death of her husband Jacques Raverat. She became Lady Barlow after her husband was knighted in 1938. She was widowed in 1968. Cambridge University Library has a painting of her in old age by her daughter-in-law Yvonne Barlow. Scientific research She worked as a research assistant at the John Innes Institute from 1905, and studied plant genetics under William Bateson at Cambridge in 1906, a centre for pioneering genetics research, and was an active member of the Cambridge University Genetics Society. She published papers on her study of the primrose flower in 1913 and 1923 which drew on her grandfather's The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species. She did not publish any further work after her marriage, but she continued her study in genetics throughout her family life. She carried out controlled cross pollinations, including in aquilegia. She visited the John Innes Institute every summer to observe the plants that had grown there. She was among the founders of the Genetics Society in 1919, and regularly attended its meetings, maintaining contact with friends including Ronald Fisher.  Darwin's editor  Her first book as editor was a new edition of The Voyage of the Beagle (1933). She published an unexpurgated version of The Autobiography of Charles Darwin, which had previously had personal and religious material removed by his son, Francis. She also edited several collections of letters and notes, including correspondence between Darwin and John Stevens Henslow, his mentor.  Legacy  Aquilegia \\"Nora Barlow\\" The Columbine flower cultivar Aquilegia \\"Nora Barlow\\" is named after her.

The episode was written by series creator Ronald D. Moore, and the television directoral debut of Michael Rymer. Moore and executive producer David Eick made the decision to slot this episode as the first of the season because of its potential impact on the audience. \\"33\\" distinguished the themes of the new Battlestar Galactica series by following characters on the spaceships, on the planets that were fled, and in the minds of other characters. Attention to detail was prevalent in this first episode; the production team, the editing team, and even the actors themselves strove for authenticity of specific portrayals and moments. Though there were compromises made due to concerns of the episode being too dark for audiences, the episode was lauded by both cast and crew in addition to winning the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. \\"33\\" originally aired on Sky One in the United Kingdom on October 18, 2004, and subsequently aired on the Sci Fi Channel in the United States on January 14, 2005, alongside the following episode \\"Water\\". Plot Having fled the besieged Ragnar Anchorage, the convoy of refugee spaceships is relentlessly pursued and attacked by Cylons. The colonial fleet must execute a faster-than-light (FTL) jump every 33 minutes to escape the Cylons, who consistently arrive at the new jump coordinates approximately 33 minutes later. After over 130 hours and 237 jumps, the fleet's crew and passengers, particularly those aboard Galactica, have been operating without sleep while facing the strain of nearly constant military action. Upon the 238th consecutive jump, Olympic Carrier (a commercial passenger vessel with 1,345 souls aboard) is left behind and the attacks unexpectedly cease, allowing the fleet some respite. When the vessel arrives three hours later, President Laura Roslin and Commander Adama order Capt. Lee \\"Apollo\\" Adama and Lt. Kara \\"Starbuck\\" Thrace to destroy it, believing that it has been infiltrated by Cylons and now poses a threat to the fleet's safety. The colonial pilots destroy Olympic Carrier while the rest of the colonial fleet jumps away. Baltar's internal Number Six explains to him that God is looking after his interests, implying that a scientist aboard Olympic Carrier was preparing to reveal Baltar's unwitting collusion with the Cylon attack on the colonies. After the fleet's last jump, the Cylons do not return, and the President's survivor whiteboard aboard Colonial One, the result of a fleetwide census, is updated with one additional soul (to 47,973) with the birth of the fleet's first child aboard Rising Star‚Äîa boy. Meanwhile, on Caprica, Lt. Karl \\"Helo\\" Agathon is captured by a Cylon patrol and then \\"rescued\\" from his Cylon captors by a Number Eight in the guise of his crewmate Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii, who shoots a Number Six to free him. Writing Ronald D. Moore (2013) While preparing for production of Battlestar Galacticas first season, writer and series creator Ronald D. Moore wrote a short list of potential storylines, one of which was \\"the fleet jumps every 33 minutes; because the Cylons are relentlessly pursuing them, the crew gets no sleep.\\" Conferring with fellow executive producer David Eick, the two decided that this story would be \\"the best way to kick off the season\\". Moore described writing \\"33\\" as a great experience; he wrote the whole script without a story outline or much structure, because he was excited to begin the first episode of the first season already \\"at the end of the road\\". Moore wrote the episode over his Christmas break before the series was officially picked up, and he later said that this aspect was what made the episode \\"one of the more fun projects that [he] wrote all of the first season.\\" David Eick called the episode a \\"standalone concept\\" that did not require having seen the miniseries to understand it. Because the miniseries ended \\"at a very happy place\\", starting the series in the middle of a crisis without explanation, and showing the audience that \\"actually, while you--the audience--were away, really bad things have been happening\\" made for a much more intriguing and interesting story. \\"33s complex storyline was a harbinger for episodes to come, and laid the groundwork with the network and audiences alike. Moore explained on his blog that the number 33 had no hidden meaning or significance, it was just sufficiently long to allow minor functions like snacking, showering, or napping, but was too short to allow anybody to gain any meaningful sleep and recharge their batteries. Further, Moore intentionally gave the number no meaning to avoid including unnecessary technobabble into a drama-driven episode. Production Michael Rymer (2011) \\"33\\" was director Michael Rymer's first television episode. He accepted the job without reading the script, saying that based on his writing experience, \\"33\\" went well beyond his expectations and excited him. Bear McCreary originally composed the musical theme \\"Boomer Theme\\" for this episode; it was later expanded for use with the Athena character, before becoming the \\"Hera Theme\\" for the character Hera Agathon in the fourth season episode, \\"Islanded in a Stream of Stars\\". Joel Ransom was the director of photography for the miniseries, but when Eick learned he was unavailable for the series, he turned to Stephen McNutt, with whom he had worked on American Gothic. In the interim, McNutt had moved on to shooting in high-definition video; this was fortuitous for the production team because, while Ransom had filmed the miniseries on 35 mm film, the production team was switching to high-definition video for the series. David Eick (2007) Executive producer David Eick opined that \\"33\\" was the \\"silver bullet\\" that ultimately tipped the scales in their favor and convinced the Sci Fi Channel to pick up the series. The network's biggest concern in picking up the series was that Battlestar Galactica would fall victim to the same trappings of space opera as other television properties (Star Trek, Andromeda, Stargate). Two aspects that assuaged these concerns were specifically discussed in the episode's DVD commentary. First, \\"33\\" went into Gaius Baltar's (James Callis) mind and visited his house on Caprica (shot in Lions Bay, British Columbia); being swept away by the blue skies and beaches in his fantasy was not the sort of imagery expected of space opera- type shows. Second was going back to the devastated Caprica and following-up with Helo's (Tahmoh Penikett) story. As sleep deprivation was a major plot point of the episode, actor Edward James Olmos (William Adama) liaised with an expert on the subject and the crew to best depict the actual effects realistically. Following up, director Michael Rymer gave each main cast member a specific symptom to emphasize to avoid repetition on screen. To aid a realistic portrayal, Olmos and several other cast members took their study a step further by restricting their sleep patterns to about three hours a night. In the episode's DVD commentary, Moore and Rymer related how there were endless discussion about the clocks to feature in this episode. Concerns over digital versus analog, size and shape, the ratio of digital to analog clocks, whether they should run forwards or backwards, and whether any labels should be stenciled or hand-drawn were all brought up. David Eick also noted that as of the commentary's recording, the clock at Felix Gaeta's (Juliani) station still had its \\"33\\" label affixed. Editing The first cut of \\"33\\" was ten minutes too long. Despite this, the production crew took extra care not to eliminate \\"human moments\\" in their efforts to trim the episode. These included a shot of Galen Tyrol (Douglas) and Cally Henderson (Clyne) walking across Galactica hangar bay, a shot of Crewman Socinus (Oyarzun) giving a bedraggled look over the shoulder of another crewmember, and a shot of PO2 Dualla (McClure) walking through Galactica remembrance corridor. In a question-and- answer session, Moore revealed a scene written for, but cut from, the episode. In the cut scene, the recurring prop in the characters' briefing room was to have been explicitly introduced and explained; the prop remained in the series, but its backstory was cut. > There was a scene cut from \\"33\\" where we saw Laura being given her copy of > the photo along with a card that said it was taken on the roof of the > capitol building on Aerilon during the attack. The photo was inspired by the > famous shot of the fire-fighters raising the flag at Ground Zero that became > iconic. I thought the Colonies would have their own version of this‚Äîa > snapshot taken in the moment that becomes a symbol of the day they can never > forget and of all they had lost. The photo itself is of a soldier falling to > his knees (possibly shot or simply overcome by emotion) as he stands on the > rooftop over looking the devastation of his city, while the Colonial flag > waves at the edge of frame. The inscription below the photo on Laura's > plaque reads, \\"Lest We Forget\\" in itself a reference to the inscription on > the watch presented to John Wayne's character in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. Other cut scenes included one shot in the pilots' head, showing the pilots \\"wrecked and exhausted [...] with an exchange between Starbuck and Apollo\\", as well as several shots of Commander Adama (Olmos) gagging and vomiting because of acid reflux brought on by sleep deprivation. A line of Olmos'--an ad-lib about suicides in the fleet--was cut so as not to alienate audiences by being \\"too dark\\". As originally written and shot, when Apollo (Jamie Bamber) fires on Olympic Carrier, it was made clear that he sees people inside. Moore wrote the scene to be strong and clear that the characters were making the decision to fire on the passenger liner in full awareness of the consequences to illustrate and emphasize \\"the uncompromising nature of the show.\\" This was an \\"enormous fight\\" between Moore and the network, with the latter feeling this was another scene that was \\"too dark\\" and had the potential to turn away audiences; the network further implied that if the scene were left intact, they may have been compelled to air the episodes out of order. To placate the network, Moore and Eick changed the ending of the episode and \\"cheated\\". Instead, when Apollo flies by other ship, it is unclear whether or not there is anybody inside. In a \\"small act of defiance\\", visual effects supervisor Gary Hutzel snuck in small, indeterminate movement behind one or two of Olympic Carrier windows on behalf of the production and writing teams. The episode also originally ended with Helo's escape from the Cylons on Caprica; again tasked by the network to keep the episode from being \\"too dark\\", Moore wrote in an additional scene--President Roslin (Mary McDonnell) learning of the newborn--upon which to end the episode with a hopeful note. Release and reception \\"33\\" first aired in the United Kingdom on , and in the United States on , almost three months later. UK viewers obliged US Battlestar Galactica fans by illegally copying the episode--via BitTorrent--within hours of its Sky One airing. , \\"33\\" has been released thrice on home video as part of the first season collected sets; on as a Best Buy exclusive, again on , and finally as an HD DVD set on . The episode was also released on as part of the entire series' home video set on both DVD and Blu-ray. Both series creator Ronald D. Moore and star Jamie Bamber (Lee Adama) claim \\"33\\" as their favorite episode. Bamber described it as \\"...the perfect episode of Battlestar Galactica.\\" Emphasizing the dark, gritty, and nightmarish aspects of the episode, the actor felt it was a microcosm of the series as a whole. In interviews with Wired UK and the Los Angeles Times, Moore opined that the episode subverted viewers' expectations and was a \\"fantastic way to open that first year.\\" \\"33\\" won the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, and drew a 2.6 household Nielsen rating, attracting 3.1 million viewers and making it the number-two program on cable (8pm-11pm). At the website Television Without Pity, the staff review rated the episode an \\"A+\\", while () 546 of their readers awarded it an average grade of \\"B\\".

It is the second-largest building in Minnesota in terms of leasable space, after the Mall of America. It was built in 1928 as a retail and mail-order catalog facility for Sears, which occupied it until 1994. It lay vacant until 2005, when it was transformed into multipurpose commercial space. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Sears, Roebuck and Company Mail-Order Warehouse and Retail Store. History The first phase of the building, along Elliot Avenue and Lake Street, was built in 1928. It was expanded in 1929, 1964, and 1979, resulting in 1.2 million square feet (110,000 m¬≤) of space. A central tower along Elliot Avenue rises 16 floors to 211 feet (64 m). After Sears closed the site in 1994, it laid vacant as development proposals came and went. The city of Minneapolis acquired the site in 2001 and sold the 1979 expansion portion in 2002 to be used by the neighboring Abbott Northwestern Hospital as a parking ramp. Two years later, Ryan Companies was given exclusive development rights to the site. The resulting plan divided the structure into a mixed-use site with about 300 residential units, plus office and retail space. In 2004, Allina Health (which owns Abbott Northwestern among other area hospitals) announced plans to move their corporate headquarters to the building, taking up most of the allotted office space. Much of the residential space is known as the Chicago Lofts located on floors 9-16 and Midtown Exchange Apartments located on floors 2-8. The building also includes the Midtown Global Market, which is home to a variety of small independently owned restaurants, cafes, and specialty grocers, and hosts community programs including music, dance, and children's activities. A prototype Sheraton Hotel was built in the former Sears parking lot. The building and hotel have direct access to the Midtown Greenway. Other buildings Midtown Exchange has a sister building called the Landmark Center in Boston, Massachusetts. Both were built in the 1920s and their designs are nearly identical. Both are former Sears warehouses that have since been renovated into commercial space. Other adaptively reused Sears warehouses include those in Atlanta (1925), Chicago (1906), Dallas (1910), North Kansas City (1913), and Seattle (1912). Similar sites under construction include the 1927 Sears Mail Order Building in Los Angeles and the Crosstown Concourse (1927) in Memphis. Similar Sears warehouses existed in Philadelphia (1919) and Kansas City (1925) but were demolished in 1994 and 1997.

Plot=In the fleet Boomer wakes up in the tool room of the Galactica hangar deck, soaking wet. Inside of her bag she finds a G-4 explosive and a towel. Upon emerging from the tool room, Boomer learns from Cally that its early morning, not evening as she believes. Returning the detonator to the arms locker, Boomer finds out that six others are missing and becomes panicked. At the same time President Laura Roslin makes a ceremonial visit to the Galactica. While Roslin believes that Commander William Adama wants the ceremony to feel more comfortable, Apollo changes her opinion on the matter by revealing that Adama hates ceremonial events and was only doing it because he thought it made Roslin feel presidential. While Roslin is on board, the Galactica begins transferring potable water to the Virgon Express, a ship that relies on Galactica for its water supply. As the Galactica transfers the water to the Virgon Express, a panicked Boomer informs Chief Galen Tyrol of her discovery. Boomer is further panicked due to rumors of Cylons taking on human form and Cylon sleeper agents in the fleet. As the water transfer occurs, several explosions vent the Galactica's portside water tanks to space, venting 60% of Galactica's water supplies. Even with rationing, it's quickly determined that Galactica will run out of water in six days. With one-third of the fleet relying on Galactica for their water, they will run out within two days. A mission is quickly launched to search five nearby star systems for sources of water. The subsequent investigation by Tyrol determines that five explosives were used to blow out the tanks and that there is still one detonator missing. The command staff quickly realize that there is a Cylon agent aboard Galactica. Roslin and Adama turn to Doctor Gaius Baltar to identify the agent. In the past Baltar had claimed to find a way of detecting Cylon agents that had allowed him to \\"identify\\" Aaron Doral as a Cylon. Baltar quickly makes excuses about why his testing method is no longer viable and Adama assigns Lieutenant Felix Gaeta to assist Baltar. To buy himself some time, Baltar joins a card game led by Starbuck, with whom he unsuccessfully flirts. With all of the other searches having failed to turn up water, Boomer and her ECO Crashdown search the last system for water. While Crashdown comes up with nothing, Boomer's scans reveal water on the moon they are investigating. However, the last detonator is attached to an explosive on the side of Boomer's seat and Boomer's Cylon programming attempts to compel her to detonate the bomb rather than reveal the existence of the water. Boomer manages to overcome her programming and announces the discovery of a source of water. Back in the fleet, Boomer and Crashdown are greeted as heroes for their success. Boomer discreetly alerts Tyrol of the bomb in her Raptor; he removes it and gives it to the master-at- arms, claiming to have found it during routine maintenance. Though Tyrol is sure of Boomer's innocence, Boomer remains disturbed by the implications of everything that has happened. Throughout these events, Apollo remains disturbed by his destruction of the Olympic Carrier three days prior. Roslin comforts Apollo and requests that he be her special military advisor. Roslin's misunderstanding of Adama's intentions with her ceremonial visit, and Apollo's clearing it up for her, have demonstrated to Roslin that she knows very little about the military and needs someone to help keep such misunderstandings from happening in the future. On Caprica Helo and the copy of Boomer return to \\"Boomer's\\" Raptor to find it swarming with Cylon Centurions. Unable to escape the planet this way, they are forced to retreat to search for another way off of Caprica. That night, while camping in a forest, Helo and the Boomer copy discuss why she (supposedly) disobeyed orders to come back for Helo. The Boomer copy claims that she couldn't bring herself to leave Helo behind. At this point in their conversation, they detect a military signal on Helo's radio. While it is indecipherable, the two realize that it means that there are military units still active somewhere on Caprica, and intend to search for them.

Plot=In the fleet Following the discovery of a new source of water, Chief Galen Tyrol and his teams determine that it is in the ice of a moon with an incredibly harsh climate. They determine that they will need a thousand men ideally to mine the water for usage in the fleet which is experiencing water riots due to the shortages. Commander William Adama and Apollo suggest using the prisoners on the Astral Queen for the needed labor. The 1,500 men on the ship have been sentenced to hard labor and were on their way to parole hearings when the attacks occurred. Apollo suggests using incentives such as points towards their freedom to get the men to cooperate. Roslin agrees to use volunteers and assigns her Chief of Staff Billy Keikeya to help sort out which prisoners can be trusted and which cannot. At odds with Apollo, Adama decides to send someone he can trust to report to him on security matters. Due to his attraction to her, Billy suggests Petty Officer Anastasia \\"Dee\\" Dualla which is agreed to. Adama sends deck hand Cally along to make sure that the volunteers can actually use the needed equipment. On the Astral Queen, Apollo makes his proposal, but no one steps forward. Finally, a man comes forward to reject Apollo's offer. Billy recognizes the man as Tom Zarek (Richard Hatch) an infamous political terrorist from Sagittaron. Billy's admiration of Zarek creates conflict between him and Dee who, while from the same colony, doesn't approve of Zarek's methods. Apollo attempts to negotiate with Zarek for his help, having admired and respected Zarek for a long time. During the negotiations, the prisoners escape and riot with the help of a guard and take over the Astral Queen, taking the crew, Cally, Billy, Apollo and Dee hostage. Zarek then makes a broadcast to the fleet, demanding that Roslin and her ministers step down and free and open elections be held to elect a new government. Zarek argues his views with Apollo, stating that he doesn't see Roslin's presidency as legitimate due to her not being elected. As the situation continues, Adama contacts Zarek in an attempt to defuse the situation while sending the marines and Starbuck to regain control of the Astral Queen and put an end to the situation. After Zarek refuses to listen to Adama and eagerly awaits the arrival of the Marines, Apollo realizes that Zarek really wants a bloodbath and to go out in a blaze of glory. Zarek reveals that his intentions are to become a martyr that will inspire the fleet to overthrow Roslin and Adama. While Apollo and Zarek talk, a prisoner named Mason notices Cally's utter defiance of him. When Cally refuses to show him respect, Mason takes Cally to rape her. When Mason tries, Cally bites off part of his ear and Mason shoots and seriously wounds Cally. Though the commotion draws Zarek and Apollo to the scene, Zarek refuses to intervene, claiming that Mason's imprisonment turned him into a monster and \\"you reap what you sow.\\" As Mason prepares to kill Cally, Apollo is able to overpower one of Zarek's men and use his gun to kill Mason. As Starbuck and the marines arrive, Apollo gets Zarek at gunpoint but chooses not to kill him. Instead, Apollo acknowledges that Zarek is right about the freedom of law. Apollo offers Zarek a deal: in exchange for Zarek and his men helping to mine the water, they will give them their freedom and the Astral Queen. Apollo also promises to hold elections within a year. Zarek agrees and orders his men to stand down. Though Starbuck still tries to kill Zarek, Apollo saves his life. In the aftermath, Apollo reminds Roslin and Adama that Roslin is only supposed to finish out the last seven months of President Adar's term and then hold elections. Apollo has only obligated Roslin to what she is legally obligated to do. The prisoners have been disarmed and left the Astral Queen and are now mining the water for the fleet. After Adama leaves, Roslin privately admits to having been diagnosed with cancer to Apollo who agrees to keep it a secret. While the crisis goes on, Doctor Gaius Baltar is approached by Adama about his Cylon detector. While Baltar starts to claim that he can't make one, his internal Six prompts Baltar to tell Adama that he needs a nuclear warhead to complete his detector. Despite Galactica only having five left, Adama reluctantly agrees. Due to the water shortage, Starbuck and Colonel Tigh both compensate by drinking alcohol and being inebriated on the job. While Tigh chastises Starbuck's behavior towards the pilots, he also backs her up with Adama, causing Starbuck to attempt to reach out to him by sharing some of the newly mined water. Tigh rejects the gesture however. Boomer continues to be nervous about the potential of her being a Cylon sleeper agent. Tyrol reassures Boomer that the master-at-arms investigation into the bombing has turned up no clues pointing towards Boomer as the bomber. Catching the two in an embrace, Colonel Tigh privately tells Boomer that the entire ship knows about their relationship which is against military regulations. However, while it was ignored while Galactica was in the process of being decommissioned, they are now in a combat situation and Tigh orders Boomer to put a stop to it. Boomer agrees to do so. On Caprica On Caprica 12 days after the Fall, Helo and the Boomer copy make their way through a deserted city with only two days of anti-radiation medication left to them. The two intend to locate a hospital to find more medication, but come across rats feasting on a corpse, disturbing Sharon.

Unnoticed by Helo or Sharon, they are observed by a copy of Number Six and Aaron Doral. The two comment on Sharon's skill while the Six expresses sadness at the destruction surrounding them.

History Feltonville was known around 1890 as \\"Wyoming Villa\\" or \\"Wyoming Valley.\\" In 1927, the City of Philadelphia set aside a corner of the recreation field at \\"B\\" St. and Wyoming Ave. for the building of the Wyoming Branch of the Free Library of Philadelphia. Completed in 1930, this branch has the distinction of being the last Carnegie library built with funds provided by the noted philanthropist Andrew Carnegie.History of the Wyoming Branch, provided by the Free Library of Philadelphia. Early residents noted Feltonville for its high ground, beautiful rolling farms, and many gracious homes. Before 1900, as a suburb of Philadelphia, public transportation was limited to the Reading Railroad's train from 3rd and Berks Streets to Newtown, Pennsylvania. The station was located at 2nd Street and Wyoming Avenue, on the northwest boundary of a farm. A local historian, Edna Walmsley Hookway, described what the scene would have looked like in 1891:Hookway, Edna Walmsley, and Arthur Whitehair (eds.), Seventy-five Years, Diamond Jubilee book of the Wyoming Avenue Baptist Church, 1891-1966.

He is often described as \\"the father of intelligence analysis\\".  Early life and education  Kent was the son of U.S. Congressman William Kent and women's rights activist Elizabeth Thacher Kent, and the brother of Roger Kent and Adaline Kent. His grandfather was Yale professor Thomas Anthony Thacher, and he was great-great grandson of American founding father Roger Sherman. He was a graduate of The Thacher School (founded by his uncle Sherman Day Thacher) and Yale University where he studied European history with the intention of spending his career as an academic. After graduating in 1926, he spent several years teaching and doing research but joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) with the outbreak of the war in Europe in 1942.  Career  Sherman Kent first served within the Research and Analysis Branch of the OSS as Chief of the Europe-Africa Division. In this capacity, he oversaw much of the process which would now be considered intelligence preparation of the battlespace in support of planning for Operation Torch, the 1942 Allied invasion of North Africa. (An irreverent wit, Kent once proposed for the heraldic emblem of the often-zany OSS, \\"A horse's ass rampant on a Boston Social Register\\".)Richard Harris Smith, OSS: The Secret History of America's First Central Intelligence Agency (Guilford, CT, 2005) After a post-war stint at the National War College, he returned to Yale for three years, during which time he penned his classic work, Strategic Intelligence for American World Policy. In November 1950, during the crisis that followed, the Chinese Communist incursion in the Korean War, which prompted a build-up and reorganization of the American Intelligence Community, he was called to Washington, DC, to assist Harvard historian William L. Langer, with whom he had worked in OSS, to form a new CIA Office of National Estimates (ONE). He succeeded Langer as chief of ONE in 1952, serving in that position for the next fifteen years under four Directors of Central Intelligence in four presidential administrations. ONE was \\"a small organization, consisting of a Board of National Estimates of between five and twelve senior experts, a professional staff of 25‚Äì30 regional and functional specialists, and a support staff.\\" Until it was dissolved, six years after Kent's retirement, in a Watergate-era CIA reorganization, ONE prepared more than 1,500 speculative National Intelligence Estimates for the President and top foreign policy-makers. Kent led ONE through years of challenge and crisis, including McCarthy-era accusations against one of Kent's young aides, future presidential advisor William Bundy,Peter Grose, \\"Gentleman Spy, The Life of Allen Dulles\\" (Boston, 1994) and \\"predictive failures\\" during the Cuban Missile CrisisSee pages 135 to 191 in and other Cold War \\"flaps\\". Kent's unique and enduring role within the US intelligence community was to formalize analytical \\"tradecraft\\" and methodologies, while encouraging creation of a \\"literature of intelligence\\" to provide a formal mechanism for the transfer of knowledge and experiences between generations of analysts.  Death and legacy  Sherman Kent retired from the CIA in 1967 and died in 1986. In 2000, CIA established a school in Kent's name dedicated to the pursuit of professionalism in the art and science of intelligence analysis.

Due to her mother's experiences with the treatment, Roslin refuses and decides to instead go on chamalla, an alternative means of treatment. During a party for the 1,000th landing of a Raptor pilot named Flat Top, an accident occurs, killing thirteen pilots and injuring seven more. Needing pilots, Commander William Adama orders Starbuck, a former flight instructor, to train more pilots. Haunted by the memories of her fianc√© Zak Adama whose death she feels responsible for, Starbuck is overly harsh on the pilots (\\"nuggets\\") and washes them all out after the first day. While discussing the situation with his father, Apollo inadvertently reveals that Starbuck holds guilt about something to do with Zak's death. After Adama confronts her, Starbuck tearfully admits that though Zak failed basic flight, she passed him due to their engagement. As a result, he had a fatal accident that killed him. Adama angrily orders Starbuck to reinstate the nuggets and to get out his sight. Following Adama's dressing down of her, Starbuck begins acting like an actual flight instructor, leaving her issues out of the cockpit. However, while on a flight with nuggets Hotdog, Kat and Chuckles, eight Cylon Raiders suddenly appear. As Galactica launches Vipers, Starbuck sends the nuggets back and attacks the Raiders alone in a sure suicide run.

It is a specialization of commercial photography, the products of which are used in advertisements, magazines, packaging, menus or cookbooks. Professional food photography is a collaborative effort, usually involving an art director, a photographer, a food stylist, a prop stylist and their assistants.Manna/Moss, Chapter 4. In advertising, food photography is often ‚Äì and sometimes controversially ‚Äì used to exaggerate the attractiveness or size of the advertised food, notably fast food. History Example of modern food photography: simple and natural, selective focus, shallow angle, extreme close-up The first known photograph that showed food as a subject was a 1845 daguerreotype by William Henry Fox Talbot showing peaches and a pineapple. For a long time, food photographs tended to be shot and composed in a manner similar to the way people were used to encountering their food: laid out on a table setting and shot from an overhead perspective, i.e., from the point of view of the eater.Manna/Moss, Introduction. Stylists accordingly arranged the food to appear good from above, with the items arranged flat on the plate and clearly separated from each other.Manna/Boss, Chapter 4, section \\"Food-Styling Trends\\". Later, romantic lighting, shallower angles and more props came en vogue, with extreme cases leading to the term \\"food porn\\". Most recently, the prevailing trend in Western commercial food photography is to present the food as simple, clean and naturally as possible and with little props, often using effects such as selective focus, tilted plates, and extreme close-ups. This complements trends in professional cooking to make the food more visually interesting. For instance, the height of dishes tends to increase and their elements are often layered, which lends itself well to narrow-angled shots. Food stylist A dish being styled for photography The role of the food stylist is to make the food look attractive in the finished photograph. The time and effort a stylist takes to carefully and artfully arrange the food, is the cause of differences between the way the stylist presents it and the way a home cook or chef may. Visual know-how is also a requirement, as is the knowledge of how to translate the perception of taste, aroma and appeal that one gets from an actual dish, to a two-dimensional photograph. Food stylists have culinary training; some are professional chefs or have a background in home economics.Manna/Boss, Chapter 4, section \\"What Is a Food Stylist?\\". In addition to knowledge of nutrition and cooking techniques, food stylists must also be resourceful shoppers. As creative professionals they envision the finished photograph and style the food accordingly. Setup Often, to highlight the product, only a piece of it is focused. The process of food photography begins with the purchase of the food and ingredients. Only the most visually perfect foodstuffs are acceptable and multiple backup or test items are usually needed. As a result, purchase of the food and ingredients is a very time- consuming process.Bellingham/Bybee, 6. The best-looking of the purchased items is selected and marked as the \\"hero\\", i.e., the item that will be featured in the photograph.Bellingham/Bybee, 8. During the setup and for test shoots, it is represented by a cardboard stand-in.Bellingham/Bybee, 4. The actual photography can take place in a studio under controlled lighting conditions, or under natural light. The light, background and setting is carefully prepared so as to present the food in as attractive a way as possible without distracting from it. The color and texture of the background is selected so as to effectively complement that of the food and to assist with its lighting.Bellingham/Bybee, 18. Styled food is usually marked as inedible and discarded after the shoot, because it may have been handled or treated in ways that make it unsafe for consumption.Bellingham/Bybee, 3 and 11. Cold beverages A stack of artificial ice cubes, used in place of real ones in situations where they would melt. To create the effect of a thin layer of condensation forming on the outside of glasses containing cold liquid, dulling spray may be applied,Bellingham/Bybee, 29. with paper or masking tape protecting the non-\\"frosted\\" areas. More pronounced condensation and dew drops are imitated by spraying the glass with corn syrup or glycerin.Bellingham/Bybee, 33. Ice cubes used in shoots are made of acrylic, so they do not move or melt during the shoot, which may take place under hot studio lighting.Bellingham/Bybee, 36. Prior to the widespread availability of acrylic cubes starting in the 1970s and 1980s, glass ice cubes served the same purpose. Fresh-looking bubbles on the surface of drinks are created by applying a mixture of the drink and detergent to the surface with an eyedropper.Bellingham/Bybee, 41. White glue may be used in lieu of milk, and a mixture of brewed coffee and water instead of tea.Bellingham/Bybee, 42. Salads Salads in food photography are composed with a view to creating appealing textures, shapes and colors. To improve support and aid in composition, salad in a bowl is built around a smaller bowl placed inverted in the larger bowl.Bellingham/Bybee, 60. Salad greens are kept fresh and crisp by misting them with cold water prior to composition.Bellingham/Bybee, 61. Salad dressing is not normally used, as it makes the salad slippery and difficult to style, but the appearance of dressing may be created by sprinkling herbs and spices over the wet salad, or mixing them in oil and applying it with a brush.Bellingham/Bybee, 62. Fruit salads are particularly challenging to shoot because of the short time the fruit pieces, which are cut immediately prior to final photography, retain their appearance.Bellingham/Bybee, 65. As only the outer layer of the salad is of interest, the concealed interior of the salad bowl may be filled by mashed potatoes or another mixture.Bellingham/Bybee, 68. Thick or heavy dressings do not photograph well; they are usually thinned and applied by brush.Bellingham/Bybee, 69. Hamburgers and sandwiches This cheeseburger's buns and toppings appear uneven in shape and position, making it look not as attractive as it could be. Hamburger photography is challenging because the buns dent easily and an assembled burger is quick to lose its visual appeal.Bellingham/Bybee, 88. When assembling the burger, the ingredients are held in place with toothpicks and the meaty interior of tomato slices is removed to avoid juice discoloring the ingredients.Bellingham/Bybee, 93. The meat patties are superficially cooked, the edges browned with a torch and the meat made to look more appetizing with a colorant.Bellingham/Bybee, 95. The edges of melted cheese slices may be brushed with household cleaner to make them look freshly melted longer.Bellingham/Bybee, 98. Condiments such as mayonnaise are applied to the edges with an applicator bottle.Bellingham/Bybee, 100. Steam is normally used to suggest the burger is hot. Sandwiches are assembled using similar techniques. Wet paper towels are used to prevent the bread from drying out. If a half sandwich is to be depicted, the bread and the components are individually sliced with scissors and assembled in place.Bellingham/Bybee, 108.

While avoiding being dragged over a cliff by her tangled-up parachute, Starbuck hits her knee on a rock, seriously injuring it. Starbuck is left trapped on the moon's surface with around two days of air and her radio broken. Boomer is able to rescue Hotdog from his disabled Viper, but finds no sign of Starbuck. In response, Apollo begins a search and rescue mission for Starbuck, ultimately focusing the majority of the search on the moon Starbuck crashed on. Due to the composition of the moon's atmosphere, the search consumes over 40% of Galactica's aviation fuel reserves and leaves over a dozen Vipers down for maintenance. Even when Starbuck's air supply runs out, Commander William Adama refuses to abandon the search, relieving Colonel Tigh of duty when he disagrees and redeploying the CAP to the search despite it leaving the fleet essentially defenseless. In the early stages of the search, President Laura Roslin offers her help, lending the civilian ships to Galactica's search for Starbuck. Doctor Gaius Baltar is reminded by his internal Six that they have at most three days before the Cylons realize their patrol is missing and send more ships. Baltar warns Roslin who presses on, but grows increasingly alarmed by Adama and Apollo's tactics. After learning of their history with Starbuck from Colonel Tigh, Roslin is able to make the two men see sense and call off the search. While the search goes on, Starbuck searches for higher ground in hopes of being found. In her search, Starbuck finds the Cylon Raider she shot down before crashing on the moon. Finding the Raider intact aside from a hole in the \\"head\\" where her shot hit, Starbuck decides to hijack the ship to return to Galactica. To Starbuck's surprise, she finds that the Raider is actually a living being instead of a mechanical ship and manages to repair the hole and figure out the Raider's controls. As the fleet prepares to jump, they detect Starbuck's hijacked Raider on DRADIS. Unaware that the ship is under the control of Starbuck, Apollo is launched to intercept and destroy it. Starbuck is able to evade Apollo's attempts to destroy her and get over his ship, revealing her name written on the underside of the Raider's wings. Realizing that the Raider is under the control of Starbuck, the relieved Adama allows Apollo to escort it aboard Galactica. On board, Starbuck is taken to the infirmary where she reconciles with Adama about Zak's death. On Caprica Fifteen days after the fall of the Twelve Colonies, Helo and Sharon remain in the fallout shelter they discovered under a restaurant a few days before.

History The church windows of the Paradiso It is housed in a converted former church building that dates from the nineteenth century and that was used until 1965 as the meeting hall for a liberal Dutch religious group known as the \\"Vrije Gemeente\\" (Free Congregation). It is located on de Weteringschans, near the Leidseplein, one of the nightlife and tourism centers of the city. The main concert hall in the former church interior has high ceilings and two balcony rings overlooking the stage area, with three large illuminated church windows above the stage. The acoustics are rather echoey, but improvements have been made over the years. In addition to the main concert hall, there are two smaller cafe stages, on an upper floor and in the basement. Paradiso was squatted by hippies in 1967 who wanted to convert the church to an entertainment and leisure club. The police ended the festivities the same year. In 1968, the city opened Paradiso as a publicly subsidized youth entertainment center. Along with the nearby Melkweg (Milky Way), it soon became synonymous with the hippie counterculture and the rock music of that era. It was one of the first locations in which the use and sale of soft drugs was tolerated. From the mid-1970s, Paradiso became increasingly associated with punk and new wave music, although it continued to program a wide variety of artists. Starting in the late 1980s, raves and themed dance parties became frequent. In 1994, Paradiso, along with the Institute for Sonology and The ArtScience Interfaculty (Amsterdam), initiated Sonic Acts together. In recent years, the venue has settled into an eclectic range of programming, which, besides rock, can include lectures, plays, classical music, and crossover artists. Long associated with clouds of tobacco and hashish smoke, Paradiso banned smoking in its public areas (except for a small smoking room) in 2008 in accordance with a nationwide ban on smoking in public venues.

He was an industrial pioneer in the coalfields of West Virginia, opening some of the earliest mines in the southern part of the state. He was also a prominent naturalist specializing in the study of butterflies. He wrote The Butterflies of North America, a three-volume treatise that is highly regarded for its scholarship and the quality of its illustrations. Biography Edwards was born in Hunter, New York, a village that had been founded by his family just five years earlier and originally called Edwardsville. The son of William W. Edwards and Helen Ann (Mann) Edwards, he came from a prominent and successful American family. His father was a businessman involved in banking, insurance and European imports. His grandfather was Colonel William Edwards, founder of the family tannery business and inventor of several devices used in the manufacture of leather goods.Dorpfeld (2013) His great-great-grandfather, Jonathan Edwards, was a distinguished theologian and revivalist preacher.Sorenson (1995) The Edwards family owned and managed a very large tannery in Hunter that relied on tanbark harvested from the hemlock forests of their country estate in the Catskill Mountains. Edwards grew up on the estate where he developed a lifelong appreciation of nature and an interest in natural history. After attending the local village school in Hunter, Edwards went on to Williams College, Massachusetts in 1838. He disliked the strong religious tone at Williams, but greatly appreciated that the school was one of the first colleges in America to make natural history an important part of the curriculum.Leach (2013) Edwards graduated in 1842 and then studied law in New York City with the expectation that he would join the family business. He was admitted to the New York bar in 1846, but did not pursue a career in law. Amazon River In 1846 Edwards traveled to Brazil and journeyed up the Amazon River with his uncle, Armory Edwards. Armory had been the US consul in Buenos Aires and worked in Argentina for the family's leather business. It is possible that the original purpose of their trip was related to family business concerns but for Edwards the focus of this trip became the beauty and untrammeled wilderness he experienced as they explored the huge delta island of Marajo and went upriver from Belem to Manaus.Planck (2013) Edwards took careful note of his experiences and shortly afterwards wrote a book, A Voyage Up the River Amazon, published in 1847. It is credited with sparking an interest in the region among natural scientists; in particular, Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace read Edward's account and were inspired to make the Amazon the destination for their famous expedition. Eventually, Edwards' book was just the first of several works written by naturalists that recorded the growing interest in the scientific exploration of the Amazon. Coal business Upon the death of his youngest brother in 1847, Edwards inherited 30,000 acres in Kanawha Valley, West Virginia (then still part of Virginia). His family had purchased the property sight-unseen from land speculators but Edwards soon determined that it was prime coal country, sitting atop some of the thickest coal seams in the world. He became one of the earliest entrants to the coal mining business in the region. In 1852 he opened the first coal mines on Paint Creek and developed the first cannel coal oil refinery in 1856. During the Civil War, Edwards organized the Kanawha and Ohio Coal Company and opened mines at Coalburg in 1863. Later, Edwards launched the mining industry's first coal towboat and used it to haul coal on the Ohio River to Cincinnati.Sullivan (2012) Butterflies Although Edwards had been interested in natural history since his childhood, he only became a serious collector and student of butterflies around 1856 at the age of 33. He probably picked up the basics of entomology from John Weidemeyer, a New York entomologist who wrote one of the first American books on butterflies and John Akhurst, a New York taxidermist who also collected insects. During the 1850s Edwards built a significant collection of butterflies and corresponded with many prominent entomologists and other naturalists including Spencer Fullerton Baird. Baird, the first curator at the Smithsonian Institution, was supportive of Edward's new passion and sent him numerous butterfly specimens from the museum collections. Other museums followed suit and sent butterflies from around the world for identification. Edwards published his first scientific paper in 1861 describing several new butterfly species. During the course of his career he published some 250 scientific papers on Lepidoptera. In addition to numerous papers describing new species of butterflies, he made important contributions in the area of polymorphism (the occurrence of more than one form in the same population of a species). Entomologists began to see polymorphism in insects as a demonstration of natural selection and an opportunity to study evolutionary processes. Edwards discovered many examples of polymorphism among butterflies in North America and showed that temperature was one environmental factor that influenced polymorphic species. By 1865 Edwards had begun work on the Butterflies of North America, a three-volume masterpiece that has been called \\"one of the most important entomological publications of the 19th century.\\"Calhoun (2013) Originally intended to be a descriptive catalog of North American species, the scope grew to include detailed life histories of many species and some of the best butterfly illustrations ever published. The illustrations were drawn by Mary Peart, a talented Pennsylvanian artist, and hand-colored by Lydia Brown. Edwards spent the rest of his career completing what was to become his most important legacy. The third and final volume was published in 1897. Edwards retired from entomology shortly thereafter. Personal life Edward married Catherine Colt Tappan, the daughter of abolitionist Arthur Tappan, in 1851. They raised three children. Their son, William Seymour Edwards grew up to become prominent in West Virginia politics, industry and literature. Their daughter, Edith Edwards, married Theodore Luqueer Mead, a notable entomologist who had apprenticed for her father. Edwards died at his home \\"Bellefleur\\" in Coalburg, West Virginia. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.Pauley (1990) Works Edwards published over 250 worksWeeks (1910) including: *A Voyage up the River Amazon (1847); *The Butterflies of North America, volumes 1-3 (1868-1897); *Synopsis of North American Butterflies (1872); *\\"Catalogue of the Diurnal Lepidoptera of America North of Mexico\\"; *\\"Revised Catalogue of the Diurnal Lepidoptera of America North of Mexico\\" (1884); After 1897 Edwards retired from his work in entomology.

In the episode, an investigation into a Cylon infiltration comes to focus on the relationship between Chief Galen Tyrol and the Galactica copy of Boomer (who is a Cylon sleeper agent) in order to weed out other sleeper agents. Plot=In the fleet As Chief Tyrol and Boomer have an illicit encounter, a copy of Aaron Doral boards the ship amongst a group of civilians before making his way to C deck. There, Doral is spotted by both Colonel Tigh and Commander Adama. When confronted, Doral commits a suicide bombing, killing three people and injuring thirteen more. In the aftermath, Adama reveals to Galactica's master-at-arms Sergeant Hadrian that the Cylons now have human form and that there are many copies of each model. Adama requests that Hadrian run an investigation into Doral's bombing. Citing the recent security breaches such as the water tank explosion, Hadrian requests an independent tribunal that will allow her to act separate from command review. Adama agrees despite President Roslin warning that such a tribunal could turn into a witch hunt. In light of the suicide bombing, Roslin reluctantly agrees to tell the public that the Cylons now have human form in hopes that despite the panic it will cause, that the action will help to expose more Cylon agents within the fleet. Roslin also shares with the press pictures of Doral and Leoben Conoy, the two known Cylon models. While being visited by Baltar, an injured Starbuck suggests that Baltar's Cylon detector project, which is located on C deck, was the target of Doral's bombing. Frightened, Baltar decides to destroy his project but is forcefully stopped by his internal Six. Hadrian's investigation is able to determine that a Cylon agent or collaborator used an open hatch on the hangar deck to reach a small arms locker where a Marine guard was killed and the explosives stolen. Hadrian focuses on Chief Tyrol after the deck gang, in an attempt to protect Tyrol, concocts three different stories about where he had been. Eventually Hadrian goes so far as to question Adama, implying that Tyrol and Boomer are both Cylon collaborators. Stating that Hadrian has lost perspective and turned the tribunal into a witch hunt, Adama dismisses it and has Hadrian arrested despite the tribunal pointing out that he has no power over them. In the aftermath of Hadrian's arrest, the tribunal places the blame on Specialist Socinus who had confessed to leaving the hatch open under interrogation to protect Tyrol. Socinus is stripped of his rank and confined to the brig. Despite knowing Socinus is innocent, Adama refuses to intervene on his behalf. Following Socinus's arrest, Tyrol ends his relationship with Boomer, recognizing that his reckless actions caused an innocent man to be imprisoned. Tyrol begins to grow suspicious of Boomer, as she came through the hatch in question just before the bombing. On Caprica Seventeen days after the Fall of the Twelve Colonies, following Sharon's apparent capture by Cylon forces, Sharon, a copy of Aaron Doral and Number Six watch Helo from a distance. The three have faked Sharon's capture by Cylon forces to test Helo's love for her by determining whether or not he will go after Sharon or will continue to find a way off of Caprica. At nightfall, the three observe Helo as he apparently chooses to abandon Sharon before changing his mind. To continue on with the next phase of their plan, the Six brutally beats Sharon. Helo's search for Sharon leads him to a wrecked parking garage where he finds a Cylon Centurion dragging Sharon. Helo destroys the Centurion and \\"rescues\\" the beaten and bloody Sharon. Unknown to Helo, the entire event is watched by Doral and Six from a distance. Analysis On his blog, executive producer Ronald D. Moore asks, \\"Was it wrong for Adama to dissolve a legally constituted judicial tribunal... simply because he sensed it becoming a witch- hunt or was he actually protecting the larger concepts of justice?\\" as one of a series of difficult political questions he felt Battlestar Galactica asked during its first season. He poses the question as one for valid debate and does not suggest an answer. Amanda Keith of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group compares Tyrol to Adama. Though Tyrol runs a tight deck, he also has a soft spot for his subordinates, as evidenced by his toleration of his deckhands' illicit distilling. Like Adama, he also inspires profound loyalty; hence his confession to keeping the hatch open, what Keith calls Socinus's \\"boneheaded move\\". Susan A. George writes that the narrative of Tyrol being involved with a deceptive, dangerous woman (Boomer) and being nearly destroyed by her fits into the tradition of film noir. In George's view, Boomer threatens \\"male authority and the hierarchical command order\\". Commenting on the scene in which Six chokes Baltar, threatens that he must finish the Cylon detector, and then kisses him, George observes a \\"mix of sadism and eroticism... characteristic of the femme fatale.\\" Reception Simon Brew of Den of Geek praised the episode, calling Adama's refusal to release Socinus and insistence that Tyrol bear the consequences of his bad actions \\"quality writing and thinking\\". Susan Tankersley of Television Without Pity gave the episode an F, calling the tribunal \\"hamfisted\\" and commenting, \\"The fact that [Hadrian] was very nearly right [about Tyrol and Boomer] is completely overshadowed\\", a point Keith echoed. Keith said the episode has \\"some surprising gems\\" but is overall \\"largely flawed\\". Writing retrospectively in the middle of the series's second season, Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity said he liked the episode, comparing it favorably to the second-season episodes \\"The Farm\\", \\"Final Cut\\", and \\"Scar\\"; he gave the last of these an A-. Connections to other series elements *The episode shows some aspects of the Colonial legal system, including a right against self-incrimination.

However, the mystery of the open hatch is not covered there and its shown that Cavil already possessed the suicide vest at the time of ordering Doral to perform the attack.

By 18 he had saved up enough cash to buy an OX-5 powered Standard biplane. In those days learning how to fly was often self-taught and Howard thought he was up to it. The Standard was a safe plane and he seemed to be learning fine when while flying was unable to pull out of a spin, crashed breaking his leg and writing off the plane, as well.http://www.windcanyonbooks.com/eZine/The_Howard_DGA-3_Pete.htm It took a long time to set his leg but at age 19, Howard moved to Dallas and started working in the Curtiss Aircraft factory. The pay was not as good as what others jobs paid but what he learned about design and construction of aircraft was worth more than money. Over the next few years he tinkered with aircraft design using spare parts to build his first plane, at the request of a Houston bootlegger, who dubbed the resulting \\"rum-runner\\" a \\"Darned Good Airplane,\\" DGA-1 giving it and future Howard aircraft their trademarked initials of DGA. Howard later in life admitted to doing some airborne bootlegging himself during prohibition. Aircraft racing Mr Mulligan Replica at Oshkosh Wisconsin 2002 In his first racing plane, \\"Pete\\", Howard won five air races. As competition increased, he and his partner, Gordon Israel, built two larger, low-wing, wire-braced monoplanes, \\"Mike\\" and \\"Ike\\" (which competed under the name Miss Chevrolet in honor of its sponsor). Fitted with a special carburetor, Ike was particularly quick in flying in an inverted position, and for a time held the world record for inverted speed. His sixth plane was called Mister Mulligan. It placed in competition for several pilots before it was destroyed in an accident in the 1936 New York - Los Angeles Bendix Transcontinental Race, a propeller failure costing Howard both the plane and his leg, and injured both his wife's - Maxine \\"Mike\\" Howard - legs. Mister Mulligan's fame led to the DGA-8 and the DGA-9 as well as the 1937 formation of the Howard Aircraft Corporation, which ran until 1944. After the accident, Howard flew airmail and passenger transports, became an outstanding test pilot, and was recognized by aircraft designers as a natural aeronautical engineer. Howard was said to be an aviator's aviator, and was also credited as a man who from natural, inborn ability, could frequently spot flaws designed by the most competent graduate engineers.From eulogy for Ben Howard by Donald Douglas Sr. at http://www.howardaircraft.org/history/110-benny-howard Engineering and test pilot career The first Douglas DC-3 aircraft were ordered by American Airlines (1935) and powered by Wright Cyclone engines. Soon after, United Air Lines ordered the DC-3, but specified Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp engines. Benny Howard was dispatched to Douglas to oversee the installation of the new engine. His career at Douglas continued for many years, including piloting the initial tests of the DC-4E, A-26 Invader, DC-6,and Fairchild C-82 Packet aircraft. He also served as test pilot on the Budd RB-1 Conestoga and other aircraft. He was elected an Honorary FellowSETP - Honorary Fellows of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. Using knowledge gained from his racing days, he developed the Howard Optimizer Kit for the DC-3, and at the end of his career was doing low-speed wind tunnel tests for the Carroll Shelby Cobra racecar.

Born in Chandler's Ford, Hampshire, Sainsbury was a right-handed middle-order batsman and a slow left-arm bowler. He was a regular in Hampshire's team for 22 seasons from 1955 to 1976. That period coincided with the county's most successful time in first-class cricket: Hampshire won the County Championship for the first time in 1961 and did it again in 1973. Sainsbury was the only player who featured in both teams, and he was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 1974 edition of the almanack. After a few games for Hampshire and the first-class Combined Services team in 1954, Sainsbury was a big success in his first full season in 1955, taking 102 wickets and scoring 586 runs. He was picked for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) \\"A\\" tour to Pakistan in 1955‚Äì56 and played in two of the four representative matches. But in an era when England's spin bowling options included Tony Lock, Fred Titmus, Ray Illingworth and Derek Underwood, this was as close as he came to Test cricket. In fact, Hampshire's successes over the next 20 years were built largely on seam bowling, first with Derek Shackleton and later, at the end of Sainsbury's career, with Andy Roberts, and Sainsbury took 100 wickets in a season only once more: 16 years later, in 1971. With no great spin, he was often used defensively as a bowler, but he took 50 or more wickets in 16 seasons. He was also successful in one- day cricket, one of the first slow bowlers to be used successfully in a form of cricket that was dominated in its early days by seam bowling. Indeed, in 1965 he became the first man to take seven wickets in a one-day match when he claimed 7‚Äì30 against Norfolk in the first round of the Gillette Cup. His batting developed usefully. No stylist, he could tailor his game to the needs of the side, providing obduracy or attack as required. For a side that for many years relied very heavily on the runmaking of just two or three players, Sainsbury's runs, usually made at No 6 in the batting order, gave Hampshire solidity. He scored more than 1,000 runs in a season six times and in 1971 was within 50 runs of the all-rounder's double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets. A superb fieldsman close to the wicket, Sainsbury was near the top of the fielding statistics for many seasons in the late 1950s and 1960s. In all first-class cricket, Sainsbury played in 618 matches, scored 20,176 runs, took 1,316 wickets, and held 617 catches. He retired from first-class cricket in 1976.

The play came in Valpo's game against the University of Mississippi Rebels at The Myriad in Oklahoma City on March 13, 1998, and gave the #13 seed Crusaders a 70‚Äì69 victory over #4 seed Ole Miss. The game was part of a Valparaiso Cinderella run in the tournament that ended in the Sweet Sixteen when the Crusaders lost to Rhode Island. Buildup Although Ole Miss was a much higher seed than Valparaiso and was expected to win easily and advance to the second round, the Crusaders played tough throughout and were down 69‚Äì67 with less than ten seconds left. Bryce Drew, Valpo's star guard and son of coach Homer Drew, missed a three-pointer with approximately five seconds left, and after Mississippi grabbed the rebound Valparaiso fouled Ole Miss' Ansu Sesay to stop the clock and send the 74% free-throw shooter to the line. Although Sesay had made three of his last five attempts at the charity stripe, he missed the first of two. Coach Drew then called his last time out before Sesay could take his second free throw, in order to draw up a play for the Crusaders' last possession. When play resumed Sesay missed his second free throw, and after a battle for the loose ball Valparaiso was awarded possession after Ole Miss guard Keith Carter knocked the ball out of bounds. This left Valpo with 2.5 seconds to get off a shot, and forced inbounder Jaime Sykes to put the ball in play from the far end of the court.

Sykes threw the inbounds pass over the midcourt line, where Bill Jenkins outjumped a Rebel defender for the ball and immediately tapped it over to a running Drew, who let fly with a 23-foot 3-point shot. Drew's defender had been left flat-footed as he considered defending Sykes, leaving Drew open as he began streaking. The ball went in as time expired, giving Valpo a 70‚Äì69 win and eliminating Ole Miss from the tournament. \\"The Shot\\" was named the fifth most memorable moment in CBS's coverage of the NCAA tournament by sports analyst Gary Parrish in a front page article for CBS SportsLine.CBS SportsLine, Memorable Moment No. 5 - Valpo's Drew Sinks Ole Miss , February 15, 2007 ESPN ranked Valparaiso's 1998 run as #3 on its \\"Classic Cinderellas\\" list, with \\"The Shot\\" as a large part of the reason why it ranked as high as it did.http://espn.go.com/classic/s/Classic_cinderella.html The Call Veteran broadcaster Ted Robinson had the game-winning call on CBS: Valparaiso announcer Todd Ickow was courtside for the radio broadcast, almost directly behind Drew on press row as he made the call: Parody \\"The Shot\\" was parodied during the 2013 NCAA Tournament with an Axe Apollo Body Spray commercial by placing a fictitious Astronaut on the Valparaiso sideline that garnered more attention than Drew's shot.

Plot=In the fleet While conversing with his internal Six in his mental version of his house, Baltar dismisses the existence of God. Six, appearing hurt, then disappears from Baltar's mind. Moments after Six disappears, Baltar is called to the CIC where he learns that a woman named Shelly Godfrey is accusing him of being a Cylon collaborator. Shelly has the form of Six, but the entire CIC crew can see her to Baltar's shock. Shelly claims to be a systems analyst from the Defense Ministry who worked closely with Doctor Amarak. Shelly provides a photograph of a man entering the defense mainframe with an explosive charge that she claims is Baltar. Shelly's story is that Amarak gave it to her shortly before his death when the Olympic Carrier was destroyed. The picture contains a reflection of the saboteur and Lieutenant Felix Gaeta is assigned to clean up the image while Baltar's work on the Cylon detector and security clearance is suspended. Baltar begins desperately trying to convince people that he is innocent and that Shelly is a Cylon agent out to discredit him because of his work on the Cylon detector. Baltar has no luck though Commander Adama becomes suspicious of Shelly when she tries to seduce him when Adama questions her story. In response, Adama has Shelly followed at all times by the marines. During this time, Baltar seeks his internal Six for help, only to find that she has completely vanished from his mind. At one point, Baltar tries to convince Gaeta in the head to believe him before assaulting Shelly. In a desperate attempt to exonerate himself, Baltar distracts Gaeta with a fire alarm and attempts to destroy the damning photograph which Gaeta has managed to clean up, revealing Baltar's face. Baltar fails and is arrested for treason and finds no help even from President Roslin. Finally, Baltar prays to God for help and his Six returns to his side. Shortly afterwards, Gaeta returns with proof that the photograph was a fake and Baltar is exonerated. Gaeta notes that it was almost too easy to find the forgery, suggesting that Shelly wanted to be found out. Shelly has also completely disappeared with no trace of where she went anywhere. At the same time that Baltar is being investigated, Chief Tyrol struggles to figure out Starbuck's captured Cylon Raider. While trying to help Tyrol, Boomer shows a disturbing affection for the Raider and later finds the word Cylon written on her mirror, panicking Boomer further due to her growing suspicions that she is a Cylon. Starbuck, after resisting physical therapy for her injured knee, is motivated to help Tyrol by a visit from Colonel Tigh and is able to once more get the Raider operating. In the end, Roslin, who had a brief health scare due to overdosing on her cancer medication, publicly exonerates Baltar while exposing Shelly as a Cylon agent to the fleet. Baltar is left wondering if Shelly Godfrey actually ever existed or if she was just a manifestation of his internal Six meant to bolster his reputation. However, Six doesn't clarify the matter. On Caprica Twenty four days after being stranded on Caprica, Helo and Sharon flee through a forest pursued by two Cylon Centurions. After stopping for the night, Helo admits his love for Boomer, telling Sharon that he had always respected her relationship with Chief Tyrol but had wanted to be the one with her. The two subsequently make love during a thunderstorm with Helo not noticing Sharon's spine glowing red. Notes *While the episode leaves the true nature of Shelly Godfrey open to speculation, the telemovie Battlestar Galactica: The Plan reveals the truth. The Plan shows that Shelly was actually a Cylon agent sent by John Cavil to discredit Baltar and his Cylon detector project. It's also implied that Shelly made it easy to find out the truth due to feelings for Baltar. Her disappearance is revealed to have been orchestrated by Cavil and another Six which ended with Cavil airlocking Shelly. *During the episode, Boomer finds the word Cylon written on her mirror. While it isn't clear who put it there, in The Plan Boomer's Cylon personality suggests that she did it in an attempt to warn Boomer of what she was so that Boomer would stop her.

Plot=In the fleet President Roslin has a dream where she is in a forest with a copy of the Cylon Leoben Conoy. As the dream ends, Leoben is suddenly sucked away from her. Upon waking, Roslin is informed by Billy Keikeya that the captain of the Gemenon Traveler has found a Cylon on his ship. The Cylon is a copy of Leoben who was identified by the pictures recently shared with the fleet. Despite Commander Adama urging Roslin to kill Leoben, she chooses to have Leoben interrogated. Adama chooses to assign Starbuck to the interrogation, believing that she won't be drawn in by Leoben's manipulations. Boomer continues her strange behavior, now humming a lullaby to the Cylon Raider that Starbuck captured. Having followed Boomer's advice to treat the Raider as an animal rather than a machine, Chief Tyrol and Starbuck have had some luck in deciphering many of its basic controls, but Tyrol is now suspicious that Boomer is a Cylon and remains distant from her. Having heard of Baltar's Cylon detector, Boomer visits him to get tested. After Boomer reminds Baltar that she saved his life on Caprica and that Helo gave up his seat for Baltar, he agrees to use Boomer as a Beta test, learning in the process that Boomer's entire family is dead in a mining accident that destroyed her whole colony. Baltar's Cylon detector reveals that Boomer is indeed a Cylon, but Baltar's internal Six warns him that Boomer is likely unaware of her true nature and her Cylon side will kill him to keep the secret. As a result, Baltar lies to Boomer that she's a human. On the Gemenon Traveler, Starbuck interrogates Leoben who recognizes Starbuck by callsign even though Starbuck refuses to tell him her name. Leoben claims he has hidden a nuclear weapon on one of the ships in the fleet that will go off at 18:30 hours. Starbuck is forced to continue interrogating Leoben while the fleet searches for the bomb without success. As Starbuck employs multiple methods of torture, particularly waterboarding, Leoben claims to be able to see the future and speaks of his religious beliefs with Starbuck who believes that he is simply afraid that he is too far away from the Cylon homeworld to download when he dies and is lying as a result. Leoben shows a knowledge of Starbuck's past and an understanding of her character before revealing that the fleet will find Kobol and from there, Earth. After another disturbing dream featuring Leoben and with less than an hour left until the bomb goes off, Roslin decides to visit Leoben herself. Roslin stops Starbuck's torture of him and extends a hand of peace to Leoben who admits that there is no nuclear bomb. Leoben claims that Starbuck is right: he is just afraid that he is too far away to download when he dies and he made up a lie as a result. However, Leoben whispers in Roslin's ear that \\"Adama is a Cylon.\\" Disturbed, Roslin immediately orders Leoben blown out the airlock. As Leoben is airlocked, a shocked Roslin recognizes that the event matches the end of her dream. After Leoben's death, Starbuck prays to the Lords of Kobol to take care of Leoben's soul despite her previous belief that he had none as she knows Leoben feared his soul would not reach God. Roslin meets with Adama over the events and has become secretly suspicious towards Adama due to Leoben's words to her. On Caprica The morning after having sex with Helo, Sharon meets with copies of Aaron Doral and Number Six in an abandoned playground. Sharon reveals that she has had sex with Helo and that while she believes that Helo loves her, he hasn't explicitly stated it. The two Cylons reveal that they are building a cabin nearby and Sharon is to convince Helo to build a life with her there or to kill him which Sharon promises to do. However, after leaving the other Cylons, Sharon reflects on her life with Helo. After reaching Helo, Sharon tells him that they must run again and faster than they had before. When questioned as to why, all Sharon will tell him is that everything has changed.

He chases her but she escapes him however, her cat, Isis, is nearly run over by a truck if not for Batman's timely intervention. Catwoman calls Isis to her using a whistle and blows a kiss to Batman who in turn, whistles softly. Later, at an Animal Rights Celebrity Auction, Catwoman's alter ego, Selina Kyle, outbids other women for a date with Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego. Suddenly, gunfire is heard and Bruce goes away to become Batman. He stops the terrorists who are attacking the police. Commissioner Gordon tells Batman that Red Claw, the most ruthless terrorist leader in the world is in Gotham City. The next day, Bruce meets Selina at her apartment. Suddenly, Selina's lawyer, Martin, calls to inform her that Multigon International, an international company, has taken the land which she purchased for a mountain lion reserve. Bruce arranges a meeting with Multigon's chairman, Stern. Stern tells them that Multigon is planning to build a major resort and there is nothing he can do about it. When Bruce and Selina leave, Red Claw appears, telling Stern to have someone keep an eye on Selina. The same night, Batman grills a mob boss for information on Red Claw while Catwoman breaks into Multigon. She takes pictures of their real plans for the major resort but a security camera gives away her presence to Red Claw. The terrorists break the door down but Catwoman escapes into the ventilation system. A terrorist corners her but she escapes into another airway. He follows her but her caltrops prick his limbs. The rest of the terrorists catch up to her but she climbs up a rope to the rooftop. She blocks the door using a wooden plank but the terrorists shoot it down. Catwoman makes a daring dash past Red Claw, flips over and leaps towards the next rooftop. Her hands grasp the ledge and Isis jumps over to safety. Red Claw fires a missile at Catwoman, the force of the blast knocks her over. Batman swings by and saves her. Catwoman kisses him to show her gratitude. When they land on another rooftop, Batman tries to unmask her but she tells him to \\"keep the mystery\\". He replies that either he unmasks her or the police to which she tells him not to deny their connection. Batman tells her the law separates them, hurting her feelings. He tries to comfort her but she throws him over, though he grabs a protruding ledge in time. She tells him never to trifle with a woman's affections until next time and he replies that there will be a next time. Catwoman returns home, unmasks herself and tells Maven, her secretary that she might save the mountain lions yet. They are unaware that one of Red Claw's terrorists is watching and listening to them. He says, \\"But, who is going to save you?\\" Part 2 The mob boss tells Batman there is a train heist that night, but none of Gotham's criminals are initiating it. Batman asks Gordon, who deduces it might be a government train. Batman finds the train but Red Claw and her terrorists are already there. Red Claw steals a can of viral plague, threatening to release it knowing Batman won't allow it, allowing Red Claw to escape. The next day, Bruce drives Selina to lunch when two of Red Claw's terrorists repeatedly bump into Bruce's car. Bruce turns around, driving towards them. The terrorists swerve away, driving off the bridge. Bruce and Selina return home and change into Batman and Catwoman, respectively. Bruce finds Isis's body hair on his jacket, deducing Catwoman's identity. Catwoman goes to the resort, taking pictures of the terrorists when two of them find her. Batman knocks them out, takes Catwoman with him and run away. However, Red Claw captures them, ties them in a shelter, releasing the plague on them. They break free and Batman pours petrol all over before throwing a grenade on it. The heat from the flames destroy the plague while the flames burn the resort. Commissioner Gordon and his policemen arrest the terrorists while Red Claw attacks Catwoman from behind until a mountain lion pounces on her and hits her off the cliff, injuring her. Catwoman returns home and finds Maven gone. Batman emerges from the shadows, telling her Maven left because the terrorists were after both of them. Catwoman asks him why he didn't tell the police that he found her. He says that he didn't want her to be arrested like a common criminal. She asks him whether he cares or not, leaning forward to kiss him but he handcuffs her saying, \\"More than you'll ever know.\\" Reception The episodes have been called \\"a great start to the series\\" with people praising the Catwoman and Batman/Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne dynamic, The Cat and the Claw Part 1 at Batman on Film however, the animal reserve/terrorist aspect of the episodes were not well-liked, with IGN thinking it \\"played heavily on the environmental card\\".http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/07/12/batman-the-animated-series- volume-one/ Batman: The Animated Series Volume One at IGN Bruce Timm himself claimed that he was \\"never crazy\\" about the series' depiction of Catwoman, singling out the environmentalist/animal rights activist aspect of the character ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1992 American television episodes Category:Batman: The Animated Series episodes Category:Television episodes about terrorism Category:Television episodes about biological weapons Category:Catwoman in other media ","title":"The Cat and the Claw"},{"id":"4448438","text":"\\"Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down\\" is the ninth episode of the reimagined Battlestar Galactica television series. Its script was originally titled \\"Secrets and Lies\\". Actor Edward James Olmos, who portrays Commander Adama on the show, directed this episode. Plot Suspecting that Commander Adama may be a Cylon agent due to recent odd behaviour, President Roslin tells Dr. Baltar that Adama should be the first person to undergo the now-functioning \\"Cylon Detector\\" blood test, a process that takes eleven hours to complete. A lone Cylon Raider appears when Adama is suspiciously off-ship. A combat air patrol disarms it, but Col. Tigh deploys a Raptor to gather data on the enemy. Shortly after, Adama appears with Tigh's estranged wife, Ellen, who everyone thought had died in the initial Cylon attacks. Adama is suspicious of her sudden appearance and orders Dr. Baltar to put her blood test ahead of anyone else's. After dinner with the reunited couple, where Ellen shrugs off Adama and Roslin's questions about her sudden reappearance, Commander Adama and Apollo go to Baltar's lab to check on her test results. A harried Baltar explains that Adama's and Roslin's conflicting orders have prompted him to switch between the tests twice already, delaying results. Tigh barges in and (prompted by Ellen) accuses Adama of pursuing his wife sexually. The shouting is interrupted by a call from CIC that the Cylon Raider has changed course, seemingly to make a kamikaze dive towards Galactica. Since Tigh had already launched Vipers on a hunch, the Raider is destroyed and the fleet saved. Adama congratulates, then asks Tigh not to let anything (like his erratic wife) compromise his performance or let anything separate their friendship. When her test finishes, Baltar declares Ellen to be a non-Cylon. Afterwards, however, talking to Number Six, Baltar refuses to confirm to her whether or not these were the real results. Back on Caprica, Helo and Sharon avoid capture by running through a sewer system. At Sharon's suggestion, they head to the city of Delphi where they can find a ship and escape off Caprica.

He has made many CGI animated films since the mid-1990s, including The End, Bingo, The Listener, Caustic Sky: A Portrait of Regional Acid Deposition, and Data Driven The Story Of Franz K. Life and career After being an engineer for years, Chris quit and began a second career as an animator. He received a BS(1984) in General Engineering and a MS(1986) degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at the University of Illinois. Three years following, he experimented in fluid mechanics research, until he made baby steps into the world of computer animation. Afterwards in 1994, he was hired to define, test, and sometimes even abuse computer graphics software products. Such products include \\"movie Grade\\" software, not limited to but including programs, such as Maya, from the Toronto-based animation firm, Alias (formerly Aliaswavefront, now owned by Autodesk). This resulted in the productions of The End and Bingo. The End was nominated in 1996 for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Afterward, he met Ryan Larkin, a renowned animator in the 1960s and 1970s, who had recently fallen in a spiral of excessive drinking, cocaine abuse, and homelessness. This resulted in the 2004 production of Ryan, which won an Oscar in 2005. Landreth's 2009 film The Spine won the Best of the Festival award at the Melbourne International Animation Festival. Produced by the National Film Board of Canada in association with Copperheart Entertainment, C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures and Seneca College, The Spine depicts a man who's physically and figuratively spineless and the breakdown of his marriage. Subconscious Password was his third with the NFB, Seneca College and Copperheart Entertainment. It won the best short film prize at the Annecy animation Festival 2013. In 2016, he created the animated vignette Be Cool for the NFB satirical public service announcement series, Naked Island. Landreth is currently an artist in residence at the Dynamic Graphics Project of University of Toronto. He is working on a feature-length adaptation of Hans Rodionoff, Enrique Breccia and Keith Giffen's graphic-novel biography of H.P. Lovecraft. His films: Ryan, The Spine and Subconscious Password were included in the Animation Show of Shows. Chris Landreth is a Master with The Beijing DeTao Masters Academy (DTMA), a high-level, multi-disciplined, application-oriented higher education institution in Shanghai, China. \\"Psychorealism\\" Chris Landreth uses standard CGI animation in his work, with the added element of what Chris calls Psychorealism. This often puts a surrealist styling into his work, notably The End, Bingo, The Spine, and Ryan. For instance, in Ryan, peoples' psychological traumas are represented by twisted, surreal lacerations and deformities. As people depicted in the film get distraught, their faces distort. At one time in the interview Ryan gets so upset he literally flies apart. Psychorealism is a style first put to words by Chris Landreth to refer to what Karan Singh described as, \\"the glorious complexity of the human psyche depicted through the visual medium of art and animation.\\" Sources * Studio Daily * Who's Who entry on Landreth * Ohio State University ReferencesExternal links * Watch Ryan at NFB.ca * * Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Directors of Best Animated Short Academy Award winners Category:American animators Category:Canadian animators Category:American animated film directors Category:Canadian animated film directors Category:Artists from Hartford, Connecticut Category:University of Illinois alumni Category:21st-century American engineers Category:Directors of Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners for Best Animated Short Category:Computer animation people Category:Engineers from Connecticut ","title":"Chris Landreth"},{"id":"4448444","text":"Festival Melbourne2006 was a twelve-day cultural event which ran concurrently with the 2006 Commonwealth Games in the Australian city of Melbourne.

It shares its title with the last episode of the original series. In the episode, the humans capture a fuel-rich asteroid from the Cylons using a plan devised by Lieutenant Kara \\"Starbuck\\" Thrace. President Laura Roslin begins seeing visions, and Gaius Baltar comes to believe that his contribution to the raid on the asteroid was guided by God. On Caprica, Helo and Caprica-Boomer keep running from the Cylons. Plot President Roslin experiences a hallucination of snakes produced by the herbs she is taking to fight her breast cancer. Later, Priestess Elosha tells her about a prophecy of a leader of the human race in exile: the leader receives a vision of 12 serpents and later dies of \\"a wasting disease.\\" The Priestess questions the president if she's indeed dying and both are surprised to seemingly confirm manifestation of ancient prophecy. An asteroid made of tylium is discovered, but it is being mined by Cylons. Commander Adama decides to take the asteroid by force and, with help from Starbuck (who is unable to fly a Viper because of a knee injury she received), comes up with a plan that uses the civilian fleet to draw out the Cylon Raiders. President Roslin is briefed on the plan and approves. The raid begins with Cylon Raiders moving toward civilian freighters, but more are sent toward Galactica, initiating a dog fight that draws the Raiders away from the freighters, which the briefing did not anticipate. Just as all seems lost, the freighters unveil a secreted squadron of 12 Vipers led by Apollo, who now have a clear path to the asteroid. Adama admits to Roslin that he strategically concealed this part of Starbuck's plan in her initial briefing. In an attempt to perform in Starbuck's out-of-the-box style, Apollo avoids the facility's defenses by flying through the mine tunnels. He bombs its tylium containers, setting off a large explosion and destroying the base while leaving several years' worth of tylium for the fleet to mine. Dr. Baltar is surprised at the success, as he had only been guessing when asked to identify the location of tylium containers. Head Six prompts him to begin thinking that he may have a role to play on behalf of the Cylon God that he had previously mocked, whilst Gaius is beginning to be faithful, encouraged as a chosen \\"instrument of God\\". On Caprica, Helo and Sharon hide from the pursuing Cylons in an abandoned stable. They flee after spotting a nearby group of Cylon Centurions led by a Number Six copy, the first indication to Helo that there are humanoid Cylons. Production The writing staff referred to this episode as \\"the Big Mac\\" during production because they believed the action would make it a crowd pleaser. It was originally slated to be the ninth episode of the first season, with \\"Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down\\" as episode 10. Executive producer Ronald D. Moore realized that the end of the eighth episode, \\"Flesh and Bone\\", in which Leoben Conoy causes Roslin to fear that Adama is a Cylon, was an ideal segue to the paranoia of \\"Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down\\", so they were switched. The only major change that had to be made was to switch the action on Caprica between the episodes. Roslin's conversation with Elosha in this episode begins the introduction of the Battlestar Galactica mythos in the re-imagined series. The show's creators wanted to retain the epic narrative of the original series but introduce it gradually, after fans had already committed to the show. Roslin receives her briefing on Starbuck's plan on an illuminated table with large figurines representing ships; the plan is later tracked on it as the raid is underway. Moore explained that the decision to use the \\"big board\\" was a result of financial and narrative constraints. Using computer graphics to narrate space battles is often expensive, and the product often has to be simplified heavily so the viewer can understand it. The idea for a big board came from classic films about World War II such as Sink the Bismarck!, Tora! Tora! Tora!, and Midway. The idea for the models came from production designer Richard Hudolin. In an homage to the original series, the appearance of the freighter that conceals the Vipers is based on the Colonial Movers freighter from the original series. Apollo's attack run through the mine shaft is an homage to Star Wars. Show composer Bear McCreary said \\"The Hand of God\\" was one of his favorite episodes to score of the first season and described it as \\"a lot of fun.\\" Reception \\"The Hand of God\\" was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects in a Series in 2005. It lost to Lost's pilot episode. Susan Tankersley of Television Without Pity gave \\"The Hand of God\\" an A-, calling the action sequences \\"pretty awesome\\". Simon Brew of Den of Geek reviewed the episode favorably, singling out for praise the use of the big board and \\"the increasing complexity of Roslin\\". John Kubicek of BuddyTV ranked \\"The Hand of God\\" as the 11th best episode of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica and called the episode \\"brilliant\\".

Academic scholarship on boundary-work has emphasized that such delineations often have high stakes involved for the participants, and carries with it the implication that such boundaries are flexible and socially constructed.  Thomas F. Gieryn  The original use of the term \\"boundary-work\\" for these sorts of issues has been attributed to Thomas F. Gieryn, a sociologist, who initially used it to discuss the problem of demarcation, the philosophical difficulty of coming up with a rigorous delineation between what is \\"science\\" and what is \\"non-science\\".In 1999 Gieryn (1999a, p.5) stated that the ‚Äúboundary‚Äù concept he introduced in his 1983 paper had been suggested by a presentation by Steve Woolgar to a meeting of the Society for the Social Studies of Science in November 1981. He attributed the mature development of his ideas to the influences of (in order of publication) Geertz (1973), Serres, (1982), Geertz (1983), Gilbert and Mulkay (1984), Shapin and Schaffer (1985), Yearley (1988), Holmquest (1990), Reichert (1992), Abbot (1995), Silber (1995), McOmber (1996), Taylor (1996), Kerr, Cunningham-Burley, and Amos (1997), and Wolfe (1997). Gieryn defined boundary- work as the \\"attribution of selected characteristics to [an] institution of science (i.e., to its practitioners, methods, stock of knowledge, values and work organization) for purposes of constructing a social boundary that distinguishes some intellectual activities as [outside that boundary].\\" Philosophers and sociologists of science, such as Karl Popper and Robert K. Merton, long struggled to come up with a criterion which would distinguish science as unique from other knowledge-generating activities, but never were able to come up with one that was stable, transhistorical, or worked reliably. Gieryn's 1983 paper on boundary-work and demarcation emphasized that the very discussions of demarcation between science and non-science were \\"ideological\\"; that there were strong stakes for scientists to erect such boundaries both in arguing for their own objectivity and the need for autonomy. Gieryn looked specifically at instances of boundary-work in 19th-century Britain, in which scientists attempted to characterize the relationship between religion and science as one of sharp distinction,See, in particular, Gieryn, T.F., \\"John Tyndall's Double Boundary-Work: Science, Religion, and Mechanics in Victorian England\\", pp.37-64 in Gieryn, T.F., Cultural Boundaries of Science: Credibility on the Line, University of Chicago Press, (Chicago), 1999. and also looked at instances in which scientists attempted to argue that science and politics and/or ideology were inherently separate as well. Many other works by sociologists and historians have since looked at boundary-work in many other situations, usually focusing on the rhetoric of scientists (or their opponents) and their interpersonal and intersocial interactions. Studies in boundary-work have also focused on how individual scientific disciplines are created.See, for example, Yeates (2013, esp. pp.93-101, and 309-349) for an account of the extended boundary-work performed by James Braid in relation to the creation of the domain of hypnotism. Following the work of Pierre Bourdieu on the \\"scientific field\\", many have looked at ways in which certain \\"objects\\" are able to bridge the erected boundaries because they satisfy the needs of multiple social groups (boundary objects). Examples An example of such boundary-work can be found in the study of science and literature. One instance of these studies is Aldous Huxley's book Literature and Science (see also Edward M. Jennings's (Ed.)1970 Science and Literature: New Lenses for Criticism, Anchor Books and Harry Raphael Garvin and James M. Heath's Science and Literature, Bucknell University Press) Another example of boundary-work occurred when individual scientists and scientific institutions published statements responding to the allegations of scientific fraud during the \\"Climategate\\" episode.Ram√≠rez-i-Oll√©, 2015 See also * Conflict thesis * Demarcation problem * Science wars * Karl Popper  Footnotes References * Abbott, A.D.

In the episode, Tom Zarek seeks to become Vice President, but President Laura Roslin thwarts him by nominating the popular scientist Gaius Baltar, who ultimately wins. A possible presidential assassin is captured but cannot be linked to Zarek. On Caprica, Helo discovers that Caprica-Boomer is a Cylon. Plot President Roslin reconstitutes the Quorum of Twelve, a representative body within the Colonial government. Tom Zarek, who had called for Roslin's resignation, is nominated to fill the vacant role of Vice President. Worried that Zarek may try to assassinate her if he wins, Roslin initially drafts her friend and confidante Wallace Gray to run against Zarek. After Gray proves uncharismatic, she pushes him aside in favor of Gaius Baltar. Apollo and Starbuck arrest a man named Valance who has smuggled a handgun aboard Cloud Nine, the ship where the Quorum meeting is being held. They suspect that he may have ties to Zarek but find him dead in his holding cell in an apparent suicide. Baltar wins the election. Zarek warns Roslin he will be back during the presidential election in six months and claims he did not kill Valance. On Caprica, Helo and Boomer prepare to hijack a Cylon ship to escape the planet when he sees another Number Eight copy that looks just like Boomer. Realizing that she, too, is a humanoid Cylon, he flees. Production \\"Colonial Day\\" was originally conceived as the first season's \\"West Wing episode.\\" Executive producer Ronald D. Moore characterized the Quorum of Twelve in the original Battlestar Galactica as a hybrid political- military body whose unwise decisions Commander Adama frequently overruled. The creators revived the Quorum in this episode as a political body similar to the United States Senate and the United Nations Security Council to exhibit a democratic, republican Colonial government in order to draw parallels with real-world governments, particularly that of the United States. Moore believed that a story about people making difficult political choices in an environment where their survival was threatened would be relevant for questions in contemporary American society about the War on Terror, perceived creeping authoritarianism in American government, and the tradeoff between liberty and security. The assassination subplot was added to give the episode, in Moore's words, \\"a certain tension and jeopardy\\" beyond what one might see in an episode of The West Wing. Moore was ultimately not fully satisfied with his own writing in this regard because the assassination fizzles, but he thought director Jason Pate made the episode work nonetheless. Moore wanted to show life in the fleet away from Galactica but was opposed to a \\"planet of the week\\" format. Cloud Nine was created as a location within the fleet that could provide a visual environment replicating that of Caprica and the other Twelve Colonies. The exterior shots on Cloud Nine were filmed at the University of British Columbia, in the Rose Garden and in front of the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts. The Quorum meeting was also filmed at UBC. The writers intended \\"Colonial Day\\" to expand upon the character of Roslin. Before the Cylon attack in the miniseries, she was a quiet person who preferred to avoid attention, but the crisis has brought out her leadership qualities. Moore characterized Roslin as a pragmatist, as shown by her recognition of Baltar's media savvy, her selection of Baltar despite lingering distrust following his actions in the episode \\"Six Degrees of Separation\\", and her willingness to push aside Gray despite his personal hurt. Moore contrasts her with Commander Adama, whom he sees as more of an idealist. When Zarek arrives on Cloud Nine the press and Zarek himself are unsure whether she will shake his hand; she does. The tension over this was inspired by questions over whether Yitzhak Rabin would shake Yasser Arafat's hand at the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. Moore conceded that there may have been a larger in-universe media presence in this episode and elsewhere in the series than would have been strictly realistic under the circumstances. He defended the choice as one that shows a setup similar to the White House press corps and thereby grounds the viewer in a familiar understanding of the influence of the Presidency. Several weeks after shooting of \\"Colonial Day\\" completed, the writers inserted a short scene appearing immediately before the vote count in the Quorum. In this scene, Apollo and Starbuck discuss the possibility of a future assassination attempt as they dress on Galactica. The writers inserted it to augment the assassination subplot when early cuts of the episode ran short. At the end of the scene, Apollo reacts incredulously to Starbuck's claim that she \\"clean[s] up good sometimes.\\" This sets up Apollo's astonishment at Starbuck's appearance at Colonial Day and further builds the characters' romantic tension. Adama and Roslin's dance is also an expression of mutual attraction, though a smaller one. During the interrogation scene, Apollo throws Valance's briefcase across the room when Valance gives an unsatisfactory answer. This was actor Jamie Bamber's idea. Helo and Caprica-Boomer's second scene in \\"Colonial Day\\" marks the debut of the Cylon Heavy Raider. The shot with the Heavy Raider was filmed in front of UBC's Koerner Library. This location was also used in the Battlestar Galactica spinoff Caprica. Reception Jason Davis of Mania gave \\"Colonial Day\\" an A, commending the performances of guest stars Richard Hatch (Zarek) and Robert Wisden (Gray) as well as main cast members Bamber (Apollo) and Katee Sackhoff (Starbuck). Davis also praised the perceived connection between the themes of the episode and contemporary politics. Simon Brew of Den of Geek also reviewed the episode favorably. Susan Tankersley of Television Without Pity gave \\"Colonial Day\\" a B-, agreeing with Moore that the main plot and assassination subplots did not fit together well but nonetheless calling it \\"not a bad episode\\". Connections to other series elements *In a podcast accompanying the episode, Moore compared the process of appointing the Vice President of the Colonies portrayed in \\"Colonial Day\\" to the process by which Gerald Ford became Vice President of the United States in 1973 following the resignation of Spiro Agnew. Moore said that under normal circumstances the Vice President would \\"presumably\\" be elected together with the President. The question of how the Vice President of the Colonies is normally chosen in-universe is resolved in the second-season double episode \\"Lay Down Your Burdens\\", when Zarek is elected Vice President as Baltar's running mate. *Starbuck and Baltar dance together at the Colonial Day celebration. In the first scene of the following episode, \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\", they have a one-night stand that ends abruptly when Kara calls out Lee's name. The writers intended the sexual tension evident between Lee and Kara in this episode to contrast with this. *During the first Quorum meeting, Head Six tells Baltar she doesn't mind if he has sex with other women. Baltar has trysts with journalist Playa Palacios later in \\"Colonial Day\\" and then with Kara Thrace in the following episode, \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\". Head Six reacts negatively to the latter encounter. *Adama and Roslin's closeness in this episode contrasts with the events of \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\", in which Adama mounts a coup and throws Roslin in the brig. Their mutual attraction becomes a sexual relationship by the fourth-season episode \\"A Disquiet Follows My Soul\\".

Situated at the base of the Glensoulan Valley, the waterfall is overlooked by Djouce and Maulin . The waterfall flows continuously all year, falling in a horsetail-fan, and ranks as the highest waterfall in Ireland. The waterfall is in the Powerscourt Estate, and is open to the public for a visitor fee. Geography Powerscourt Waterfall, known in Irish as Eas Chonaill, lies at the base of the Glensoulan valley, a hanging valley, through which the River Dargle flows from its source on the southern slopes of Tonduff mountain, eventually falling into the steep corrie in which the waterfall lies. Several mountains surround the upper section of the Glensoulan valley in a \\"horseshoe-shape\\", being: Maulin , Tonduff , War Hill , and Djouce . The waterfall is bounded by Crone Woods on its northern section. Geology Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI) regard the waterfalls an \\"important site for both the glacial feature and for the geological influence of the rocks themselves on the formation of the waterfall\\"; and describe the Powerscourt corrie, in which the waterfall sits, as \\"a fine example of glacial erosion, where accumulated ice has scoured out a deep basin, with a waterfall flowing down the steep backwall\\". The Powerscourt waterfall flows over Irish Ribband Group schists, which sit in a metamorphic aureole of Leinster granite. The cleavage (or schistosity) dips steeply outwards, paralleling the sides of the granite pluton, which forms the surface over which the water cascades; however, the GSI note the contact between schist and granite is some distance upstream of the waterfall. Both boulders of schist (a silvery-sheen appearance), and of granite (a speckled crystalline appearance), can be seen in the pools at the base of the waterfall. Access The waterfall is part of the Powerscourt Estate, who grant paid-access to the public through a separate visitor entrance (6 miles from the main estate entrance) during set times. At the base of the waterfall are visitor facilities, car parking, picnic and barbecue area, and various concessions. The waterfall can also be viewed from Ride Rock in Crone Woods, which also offers trails to the summit of Maulin. A 7-kilometre 3-hour hill-walking route known as the Maulin Circuit, takes in Crone Woods, Maulin and the Powerscourt waterfall. Notable events= In history  * In August 1821, during the visit of King George IV to Ireland, Richard Wingfield, 5th Viscount Powerscourt dammed the waterfall so he could release a torrent while the two stood on the bridge below the falls. For reasons unknown, the king did not leave the banquet at Powerscourt House to view the waterfall, which was fortunate as, when the water was finally released, the bridge was washed away. In popular culture *Powerscourt waterfall features in various scenes in the 2013 television historical drama series Vikings. *The waterfall also features in other films including the 1981 film Excalibur by John Boorman.

The city proper, with a population of about 44,000, is the third-largest one of its province. History The town was founded in 1836 under the name Nueva Bermeja. The railroad, arrived nearby the town still in 1843, reached it in 1851. In 1852, Fernando Diago, the owner of the sugar-mill Ponina, inaugurates the first public school in town. In 1859, it achieved the status of villa (town) with the name Col√≥n, after Christopher Columbus (Crist√≥bal Col√≥n in Spanish). The founder's name is don Mart√≠n Jos√© Zozaya, who founded the town in the former hacienda named La Bermeja. The deed to establish this town was signed in the city of Matanzas in 1836. At the time, don Mart√≠n set apart land for a cemetery and a church. Until the 1977 administrative reform, the municipality was divided into the campos of Ag√ºica, Este, Guareiras, Jac√°n, Laguna Grande, Oeste and Palmillas. Geography Col√≥n borders with the municipalities of Corralillo (in Villa Clara Province), Los Arabos, Calimete, Jag√ºey Grande, Perico and Mart√≠. Its territory includes the villages of Ag√ºica, Banaguises, Guareiras, La Panchita, M√©xico, Ren√© Fraga, R√≠o Piedras, San Jos√© de los Ramos, Santa Gertrudis, Segio Gonz√°lez and other minor rural localities. Demographics In 2004, the municipality of Col√≥n had a population of 71,579. With a total area of , it has a population density of .  Architecture  The city of Col√≥n, since its founding, has gone through different architectural styles, some of them on specific buildings and others that were emblematic in different stages, but left a very strong imprint that identifies this villa and ranging from Neoclassicism, through the Balloon Frame, Eclectic, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, until rationalism. It can be seen in its streets, well marked and different styles of its buildings. The peak of the neoclassicism can be admired in the Catholic temple founded December 8, 1872, and the Town Hall. In the late 1880s, as atypical and off note of the layout of the town, was built the Quinta de Tirso Mesa, an irrefutable example of the introduction of Balloon Frame and the phenomenon of acculturation in our architecture. Now This building is gone, but it has left a mark on the population still remembered for its beauty. The introduction of eclectic at Columbian architecture was made with the construction of the School of Arts and Crafts, built between October 16, 1911, and November 28, 1912. While not renouncing some neoclassical codes, in this style can be mentioned other constructions such as Ferrolana, Provincial Agricultural College (now Polytechnic Institute of Health Mario Mu√±oz), etc. The period 1930-1959 meant a lot to the city for two main reasons: the opening in 1930 of the section of the Carretera Central highway between Havana and Santa Clara, and the rise to mayor of Jos√© Manuel Guti√©rrez Plans (1927 - 1933), under whose mandate several notable buildings appeared, such as the New Continental Hotel (1937), resulting in a new architectural style in the city, Art Deco, with the Canal Theatre as its finest example. Between 1948 and 1959, rationalism makes its entrance into the city, and the best examples can be seen in the Santiago- Havana and Grand Charity hotels. Economy Col√≥n's economy is centered around agriculture (sugarcane, tobacco, citrus fruit, honey) and stock raising. It is also an important railway center.

In the first part, the human fleet discovers the abandoned planet Kobol. A survey team is stranded there by Cylons while President Laura Roslin convinces Starbuck to disobey orders and retrieve the Arrow of Apollo. In the second part, Commander William Adama stages a military coup and places Roslin in Galacticas brig. Starbuck retrieves the Arrow and discovers that Boomer, still on Galactica, is a Cylon. This Boomer destroys the Cylon Basestar orbiting Kobol, returns to Galactica, and shoots Commander Adama; the season ends on a cliffhanger. \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\" underwent numerous substantial rewrites. It was one of the most expensive episodes of the first season to produce. The episode received favorable critical review. Michael Hickerson of Slice of SciFi ranked it as the fourth best episode of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica. Simon Brew of Den of Geek called it \\"just outstanding television.\\" Plot=Part 1 When a habitable planet is found, President Roslin concludes that the planet is Kobol, the mythical birthplace of humanity. Commander Adama wants to begin permanent settlement of Kobol, but Roslin cites scriptures in her belief that Kobol will point the way to Earth.The connection, if one exists, between the Earth of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica and the real-life Earth is unknown at this point in the series. However, this would require retrieving an artifact called the Arrow of Apollo from Caprica; Adama is unwilling to commit vital military resources (particularly the captured Cylon Raider that can make long jumps) when he doesn't believe Earth even exists. Roslin convinces Starbuck to disobey her orders and take the captured Raider to Caprica to retrieve the Arrow of Apollo. On Caprica, Helo nearly kills the copy of Boomer he has been traveling with but decides to keep her alive. Afraid that she will hurt someone, Boomer tries to shoot herself but survives. She discusses her angst with Galen Tyrol. Commander Adama sends a survey team down to Kobol in a Colonial Raptor, which is shot down by Cylons, leaving several Galactica crew members stranded. Part 2 Starbuck arrives on Caprica and, after a fight with a Number Six, retrieves the Arrow of Apollo. She discovers Helo with Boomer. Helo stops her from killing Boomer: although she is a Cylon, she is also pregnant with his child. On Kobol, Head Six shows Dr. Baltar a vision of a crib in an ancient Opera House and declares that God has tasked him with protecting the \\"first of the new generation of God's children.\\" Adama demands that Roslin resign, since convincing Starbuck to disobey orders violated their power-sharing arrangement where he would make all military decisions and she would oversee the civilians. When she refuses, he sends a team of Marines to Colonial One to arrest her. A standoff ensues between Colonel Tigh and Apollo, and Roslin surrenders to avoid bloodshed. Both she and Apollo are sent to Galacticas brig. Adama orders the Boomer on Galactica to destroy the Cylon Basestar orbiting Kobol: a captured Cylon transponder allows Boomer's Raptor to penetrate the Cylon defenses. The launch system jams, so she is forced to land the Raptor inside the basestar and release the nuclear warhead manually. There she encounters several copies of herself, proving to her that she is a Cylon. She flees in the Raptor, destroys the basestar and returns to Galactica. Under the influence of her Cylon programming, Boomer shoots Adama twice in the torso. Characterization According to executive producer Ronald D. Moore, Roslin's character had a secular worldview at the start of the series, but her experience hallucinating the Opera House in \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\" makes her believe in the Scriptures. She becomes a woman of faith because she considers it logical given the evidence. Nonetheless, it is new enough that she is uncomfortable arguing from religion that Adama should send the Raider to Caprica. Adama is respectful but thoroughly secular by contrast. According to Moore, Baltar's scene with Boomer before she shoots herself reveals a darker, more manipulative side to his character than had been shown in the series so far. Understanding that Boomer is a Cylon and poses a threat, Baltar encourages her to kill herself, a move Moore says not even Head Six may have thought him capable of. According to Moore, Baltar wanted to sleep with Starbuck from the scene when they first met, in the earlier episode \\"Water\\", and only became more interested as she continued to spurn him in later episodes. Six's reaction in \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\" to Baltar sleeping with Starbuck is the first indication that Six and Baltar have a relationship that is not strictly in Baltar's head. According to Moore, Starbuck's devotion to Adama is so strong that rational arguments would be unable to persuade her to disobey his orders. Roslin realized that her only option was to show Starbuck that Adama had betrayed her first, and this strategy works. Production Partly because of the large amount of computer-generated imagery (CGI), \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\" was more expensive to produce than others in the first season. The production team kept costs down on prior episodes in order to have a greater budget available for \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\". Sci Fi also allocated additional money for it. Writing \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\" was executive producer David Eick's first time writing for television. According to Moore, Eick mapped out the story while Moore concentrated on rewrites and production details for other episodes. Moore wrote the teleplay. Several ideas for the plot of \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\" were considered but abandoned: *The cliffhanger was originally going to consist of Apollo, Tyrol, Cally, and others pinned down by Cylons in a temple on Kobol. The idea was abandoned due to budget constraints. Also, Roslin was going to still be barricaded in her office at the time Adama is shot. *It was decided later that Apollo should not be on Kobol at all, but aboard the fleet to participate in the events surrounding the coup and to be present when his father is shot. A plotline that had Tyrol questioning Apollo's command decisions was transferred to Crashdown. *Another abandoned idea around the Kobol temple had Baltar traveling through an underground passage in the temple, coming to a room where he would hear and recognize a Jimi Hendrix song, and meeting a character played by Dirk Benedict who would introduce himself as God. Reactions were mixed, and Sci Fi network executive Mark Stern nixed the idea, saying it was too hokey. Moore ultimately agreed with this assessment. *An early conception of the Opera House scene had an orchestra onstage playing a piece that would be recognizable to the audience. Baltar would sit in an empty chair, pick up a violin, and start playing despite not knowing how. *A scene in which Tyrol persuades Adama to reinstate Specialist Socinus and then berates Socinus was cut due to time constraints. Socinus was sent to Galacticas brig during a prior episode, \\"Litmus.\\" Moore expressed regret for cutting this scene in his podcast commentary for the second-season episode \\"Valley of Darkness\\". *The writers considered narrating some of \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\" through \\"interviews\\" in which characters spoke directly to the camera. The idea was abandoned for lack of time. Some characters speak to the camera when interviewed by journalist D'Anna Biers in the second-season episode \\"Final Cut\\". The boxing scene was the idea of actors Edward James Olmos and Jamie Bamber, who played Commander Adama and Apollo, respectively; they even choreographed the scene. Eick pitched the idea of a fight scene between Six and Starbuck about halfway through the first season. The fight was present in every draft of \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\". Design Scenes on Caprica were given a distinct \\"look\\" to contrast them with scenes on Kobol; both planets' surfaces appear in \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\", and the production team wanted to ensure that audiences would be able to tell them apart at a glance. One element of Caprica's \\"look\\" is frequent rain, which is also an acknowledgment of the ecological effects of the Cylon nuclear attack on the planet. Moore initially advocated for the interior of the Cylon basestar to be a simple white room. Production designer Richard Hudolin and another writer suggested a biomechanical environment, the idea that eventually won out. The design was supposed to resemble but remain distinct from the interior of the stolen Raider. The footage of the Raptor flying through the basestar interior is CGI, but the scenes of Boomer outside the Raptor were filmed on a set. Filming Director Michael Rymer and film editor Dany Cooper made a number of changes from the episode's script: *Moore originally wrote the teaser as a sequence of extreme close-ups. It also included scenes from Roslin's cancer treatment. *A scene of Starbuck testing the Raider was cut and footage woven into the scene in which Starbuck steals the Raider. *Starbuck's flight to Caprica was originally scripted to occur during Part 2; they moved it to the end of Part 1 to augment the action in Part 1 and open up more time to tell the story of Part 2. Moore thought the emotional impact of this scene made it a better candidate to end Part 1 than the original choice, the Raptor crash. Moore concedes that Roslin's security detail permits Tigh and his Marines to get much closer to Roslin than a real presidential security detail like the United States Secret Service would. He explained that some realism was sacrificed to enhance the drama. In Starbuck's sex scene, actor Jamie Bamber (Apollo) was filmed as Starbuck's partner until she calls out Lee's name, at which point actor James Callis (Baltar) replaces him. According to Moore, this was done \\"to establish who Starbuck would rather be with.\\" In the flaming Raptor sequence in the Part 2 teaser, only the Raptor explosion was CGI. Callis actually reached his hand through flames during the shots where Head Six leads Baltar out of the Raptor. According to Moore, the actors on Battlestar Galactica disliked filming Raptor scenes generally because the space is so cramped, but this reflects reality aboard military transports. The scene where Boomer encounters the Number Eight copies was shot with motion control photography. Actress Grace Park played every copy and had to move and speak according to a precise rhythm in each shot. Moore called the process very time-consuming and expensive. Actresses Tricia Helfer (Number Six) and Katee Sackhoff (Starbuck) did their own stunts for their fight scene. They trace the beginning of their friendship to their antics on-set filming this scene. Music Rymer asked composer Bear McCreary to write a classical- sounding piece for Baltar's vision of the Opera House. The result was \\"The Shape of Things to Come\\", which is closely connected to \\"Passacaglia\\", the piece McCreary wrote for the Part 1 teaser. McCreary recalled that Rymer was unsatisfied with earlier versions of the Part 1 teaser music and encouraged McCreary to stop approaching it as a film score. McCreary stopped looking at the footage for inspiration and produced \\"Passacaglia\\". Interview first appearing in the January 2007 issue of Film Music Magazine. Reception \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\" received favorable critical review. Susan Tankersley of Television Without Pity gave Part 1 of \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\" an A+ and Part 2 an A. David Thomas of AOL's TV Squad called the Raptor crash sequence \\"[o]ne of the most superb crash scenes in Sci-Fi television history\\" and said, \\"the only slow part seemed to be the crash victims on Kobol.\\" Jason Davis of Mania gave Part 1 an A, comparing it favorably with the original series episode \\"Lost Planet of the Gods\\", praising the contribution of both Boomers to the emotional tone, and calling the teaser \\"masterful\\". He also gave Part 2 an A, calling it better than Part 1 and expressing particular appreciation for the tension between Crashdown and Tyrol, which he described as unconventional in science fiction. Simon Brew of Den of Geek said, \\"the second part of 'Kobol's Last Gleaming' had me screaming at my television set. ... [T]his is just outstanding television.\\" Michael Hickerson of Slice of SciFi ranked \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\" as the series's fourth best episode. Kelly Woo of TV Squad ranked Part 2 second best, writing, \\"Jaw, floor. Enough said.\\" John Kubicek of BuddyTV ranked Part 2 as the 12th best episode, calling Six and Starbuck's fight scene \\"one of the best and sexiest fight scenes in the history of television.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN ranked Boomer shooting Adama #6 on his list of the series's top 20 storylines and moments. Series context *The conflict between Adama and Roslin in \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\" is the culmination of tension that has been building since they forged their power- sharing arrangement. Although they have developed a degree of mutual respect, their different priorities make a confrontation inevitable, in Moore's view. *Adama does not return to command until the fifth episode of the second season, \\"The Farm\\". He and Roslin do not reconcile until two episodes later, in \\"Home, Part 2\\". *Crashdown is the ranking officer among the survivors of the Raptor crash, but several of the character's actions are intended to cause the audience to question his leadership. His decisions in the first three episodes of the second season bring him into conflict with the other survivors, especially Tyrol. *According to Moore, the Caprica storyline of the first season builds to the revelation of Caprica-Boomer's pregnancy in \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\". In his podcast commentary for \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\", Moore said why the Cylons were so interested in getting Caprica- Boomer pregnant would be answered in the second season. In the second-season episode \\"The Farm\\", Caprica-Boomer explains that \\"be fruitful\\" is one of the Cylon God's commandments. *In \\"Flesh and Bone\\", Leoben Conoy prophesied that the human fleet would find Kobol. *In season 3, D'Anna Biers has a sequence of visions of the Opera House, culminating with a vision of the Final Five Cylons in the episode \\"The Eye of Jupiter\\". Roslin, Athena, and Caprica Six begin sharing visions of Athena's daughter Hera in the Opera House in the third- season finale, \\"Crossroads\\". The Opera House's true meaning is revealed in the series finale, \\"Daybreak\\". *In the following episode, \\"Scattered\\", the cradle in the Opera House is revealed to contain a baby girl, whom Head Six describes as her child with Baltar.

It forms a rosette of fleshy gray-green leaves 20‚Äì70 cm long and 4.5‚Äì10 cm broad, with sharp spines along the edges and at the tips. It flowers at maturity (20 to 40 yearsDole 1996, pg. 57), sending up an inflorescence 2‚Äì6 m tall. The panicle bears numerous yellow, funnel-shaped flowers 3‚Äì6 cm long. There are two varieties: *Agave deserti var. deserti. Plants usually with numerous rosettes; perianth tube 3‚Äì5 mm. Southern California only. *Agave deserti var. simplex (Gentry) W.C.Hodgson & Reveal. Plants usually with one or only a few rosettes; perianth tube 5‚Äì10 mm. Southern California and Arizona. Cultivation and uses The desert agave is drought-tolerant but requires good drainage. The desert dwelling Native Americans used fibers from the leaves to make cloth, bowstrings, and rope. Young flower stalks (roasted), buds, and hearts of plants (also roasted) were eaten. Natives of southern California commonly harvested the \\"heads\\" using a specialized digging stick and roasted the leaves and heart alike. Food thus obtained often became a dietary staple, even into drought years. Alcoholic drinks were also manufactured from the sweet juices of this and other agaves.

The native of Alma, Missouri, was a right-handed pitcher who appeared in 109 games in Major League Baseball‚Äî107 of them for Boston's National League franchise‚Äîduring all or parts of five seasons between 1937 and 1945. He was listed as tall and . He attended Missouri Valley College. Playing career Fette's pro career began in 1928. He spent nine years (1928‚Äì1936) in minor league baseball, including eight full seasons in the top-level American Association, before his big-league debut as a member of the 1937 Boston Bees. That year, the 30-year-old Fette and another MLB rookie and minor-league veteran, 33-year-old Jim \\"Milkman\\" Turner, each won 20 games for the fifth-place Bees. Fette enjoyed three strong seasons with the Bees, posting a 41‚Äì33 won‚Äìlost record and an even 3.00 earned run average in 95 games pitched from 1937‚Äì39. He threw 14 shutouts and 51 complete games. In 1939 he was named to the National League All-Star team, and hurled two scoreless innings during the Senior Circuit's 3‚Äì1 defeat at Yankee Stadium, allowing only one hit and fanning future Hall of Famer Joe Gordon. But 1939 also saw a decline in Fette's workload and he ended the year with six consecutive losses. Then in 1940, he remained ineffective, losing all five decisions with Boston and posting a poor 5.57 ERA before being waived to the pennant-contending Brooklyn Dodgers on June 21. Fette appeared in only two games for the Dodgers as a relief pitcher, and was sent back to the minor leagues. After spending 1943 and 1944 out of baseball, he returned to the majors with the 1945 Boston Braves‚Äîthey had returned to their longtime nickname in 1941‚Äîfor the last year of the World War II manpower shortage, and lost two more decisions, including his final big-league starting assignment.

Usually, these storms originate in the eastern Pacific Ocean, make landfall in the Mexican states of Baja California or Sonora, and dissipate before crossing into the United States. Thus, in most cases, it is only the tropical cyclones' remnant moisture that produces heavy rainfall‚Äîand in some occasions, flooding‚Äîin portions of Arizona. However, approximately every five years, a tropical cyclone retains sufficient strength to enter the state as a tropical storm or a tropical depression. Arizonans can expect indirect flash floods caused by the remnants of tropical cyclones to occur about every two years. Tropical cyclones in Arizona are not common, since the predominant wind pattern steers most storms that form in the Eastern Pacific either parallel or away from the Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico. As a result, most storms that could affect Arizona are carried away from the United States, with only 6% of all Pacific hurricanes entering US territory. Not all Arizona hurricanes originate from the Pacific Ocean, however; in July 2008 an Atlantic hurricane named Hurricane Dolly produced rainfall in the eastern portion of the state, and another Atlantic storm reached Arizona as a tropical depression. Many, but not all, of these systems also impacted California. Despite their rarity, hurricanes are among Arizona's most significant weather makers. In years when Arizona is affected by a tropical cyclone, these can be responsible for up to 25% of the rainfall in areas along the Colorado River. Arizona hurricanes are also responsible for torrential rains in localized areas, with the state's 24-hour rainfall record‚Äî of precipitation‚Äîoccurring during Hurricane Nora's landfall in 1997. The heavy rainfall can trigger extensive flash floods, such as the ones produced by the remnants of Tropical Storm Octave in 1983, or the lingering moisture from Tropical Storm Emilia in 2006. Climatology Tropical cyclones are not common over Arizona, but on average, a tropical storm or a tropical depression enters the state approximately every five years. However, indirect flash floods caused by the remnants of tropical cyclones are more common, as they tend to occur about every two years. Storms that approach the southwestern United States, and by extension Arizona, generally form closer to the Mexican shoreline than average, making them more likely to recurve northwards under the influence of an approaching trough. These troughs tend to extend farther to the south during the latter part of the Pacific hurricane season, in the period between late August and early October. These pronounced troughs thus produce a synoptic-scale flow that is conducive to steering hurricanes towards the southwestern United States. The infusions of tropical moisture from Arizona-bound tropical cyclones can be a significant portion of the rainfall in the region. In years when hurricanes approach Arizona, eastern and northern portions of the state receive on average 6‚Äì8% of the monsoon-season precipitation from tropical systems and their remnants. This percentage rises towards the southwestern corner of the state, which can receive up to a quarter of its monsoon-season rainfall from tropical cyclones. Storms Tropical storms are one of Arizona's main sources of rainfall, as they infuse the monsoon over the southwestern United States with moisture, producing large-scale floods in occasions. However, all of the storms that have impacted Arizona have formed in the latter parts of the Pacific hurricane season, and only storm remnants have affected the state before August. { class = \\"wikitable sortable\\" + class=\\"navbox-title\\" style=\\"border: 1px #aaa solid; padding: 0.2em;\\" Chronology of tropical cyclones in Arizona - !

Before 1960 Records of tropical cyclones in the East Pacific before 1950 are sparse, but there were still several storms that produced rainfall over Arizona in this period. *August 1921: The first known tropical disturbance to affect the state occurred when a remnant low of a tropical cyclone moved into the western portions of the state. * September 1921: A tropical depression that had tracked parallel to the Mexican coastline moved into Arizona, causing heavy rainfall on September 30. This tropical storm caused more than three inches of rainfall along the Colorado River valley, with of rain reported in Yuma. Throughout the state, Flagstaff saw of rainfall, while of precipitation fell in Prescott, in Tucson, and in Phoenix. * September 1926: Five years later, the remnants of another September storm hit the state, but this time the precipitation was heaviest on the southeastern portion of the state. The 1926 storm caused over of rain in the vicinity of Douglas. * September 1927: The remnants of another tropical system caused of rainfall throughout the state. * June 1929: The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project discovered that a rare Atlantic hurricane reached the eastern part of the state as a tropical depression. Damage from this storm, if any, is unknown. * August 1935: The remnants of an unnamed tropical storm that landed on Southern California caused torrential rain and flooding across Arizona, especially along the Santa Cruz River and Rillito Creek on Southern Arizona. The rainfall from the storm contributed to an extremely wet month of August, which still holds the monthly rainfall record at the National Weather Service office in Tucson, as of rainfall fell during the month. * September 1939: Two tropical systems entered the state during the month. On September 4, the remnants of a former hurricane entered southwest Arizona, near Yuma. More than of precipitation fell in northwest Arizona, with many parts of the state collecting more than an inch of rain. This same system produced more than twice the average annual rainfall in Imperial Valley, California. On the 11th, the remnants of a separate system also passed over southwest Arizona. *August 1951: No tropical cyclones are known to have affected Arizona in the 1940s. However, in the 1950s, the remnants of two more storms affected the state. On August 24, 1951, the moisture from a hurricane that made landfall in Baja California moved over the state, producing more than of precipitation over southwestern Arizona. Flagstaff saw of rain, with similar totals measured at Prescott () and Phoenix (). The storm also washed out several roadways near Gila Bend, isolating the city from motorists. Overall, the storm caused $750,000 (1951 USD) in property damage. *July 1954: Three years later, the remnants of another hurricane moved over Arizona from the south during the month of July. Damage from this storm is unknown. 1960s * September 1962: Remnant moisture from Tropical Storm Claudia caused severe flash floods in the vicinity of Tucson, with of precipitation falling over the headwaters of the washes of Santa Rosa, Jackrabbit, and Brawley during a 14- to 15-hour period. Over of rainfall also fell near the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. The ensuing flood of the Santa Cruz River and its tributaries produced a path of destruction about long and up to wide. Santa Rosa Wash conveyed at its peak; Los Robles Wash carried up to , while the Santa Cruz River proper peaked at . The washes and rivers reached depths of up to , and overflowed its banks in places by . Flooding from the storm inundated the towns of Marana and Sells, both in Pima County. Total damage in Pima and Pinal Counties exceeded $11 million (1962 USD). * September 1964: The next storm to affect the state was Tropical Storm Tillie in 1964.

It aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on July 15, 2005. In the episode, Commander William Adama is in critical condition following his shooting in the cliffhanger ending of the first season. Galactica is separated from the fleet during a Cylon attack, and Colonel Saul Tigh, now in command, must reunite them. He does this by ordering the ship's computers networked in defiance of Adama's standing orders. Cylon Centurions board Galactica. On Kobol, Cylons kill one of the survivors of the Raptor crash. The episode received favorable critical reception. Plot With Commander Adama shot in the chest by Boomer, Col. Tigh is forced to take command as a Cylon Basestar arrives. Tigh has the fleet take an emergency faster-than-light jump to escape, despite the stranded survey team on the planet Kobol. When Galactica jumps, however, the rest of the fleet is not there. Tigh interrogates Boomer in the brig. Boomer, horrified at her own betrayal, urges him to kill her, but he refuses. A medic is forced to operate on Adama in Dr. Cottle's absence. In a sequence of flashbacks, Tigh recalls how Adama got Tigh back into the Colonial Fleet following the First Cylon War. In order to find the fleet, Tigh has Galactica jump back to orbit around Kobol with the ship's computers networked together (something Adama would have vehemently opposed because of the dangers of Cylon hacking) to calculate the jump coordinates before the Cylons can destroy Galactica. He also paroles Apollo, still in the brig for his attempted mutiny, so that he can command the Vipers in the coming battle. As the battle rages, the Cylons attempt to hack Galacticas network, but Lieutenant Gaeta's software firewall appears to hold. A Cylon Heavy Raider crashes into Galactica shortly before Galactica jumps and meets the fleet. A group of Cylon Centurions emerges from the Heavy Raider. On Kobol, Crashdown orders the survivors to take cover in a nearby forest. In an attempt to recover medical supplies that they left behind, he has Tarn, Chief Tyrol and Cally retrieve them, but Cylons kill Tarn before they get back. On Caprica, Helo stops Starbuck from shooting Caprica-Boomer. As they argue, Boomer steals Starbuck's Cylon Raider, stranding them. Characterization In his podcast commentary on \\"Scattered\\", executive producer Ronald D. Moore discussed his views of what the episode's events reveal about several of the characters. *Tigh's success leading Galactica back to the fleet in \\"Scattered\\" and dealing with the Centurion threat in the following episode, \\"Valley of Darkness\\", validates Adama's faith in him. After the military crises pass, Tigh's leadership is hampered by his lack of political skill, his alcoholism and Ellen Tigh's manipulation. *The writers created Crashdown in the first season to replace Helo as Galactica-Boomer's electronic countermeasures officer. He was conceived as a jokester and he demonstrates in this episode that he may not have the skills necessary to lead an infantry unit. *During the space battle, the Marine guarding Laura Roslin's cell asks to pray with her and calls her a prophet of the gods. According to Moore, this marks the beginning of some people in the fleet viewing Roslin as a religious figure and Roslin's reluctant embrace of that role. *The scenes between Roslin and Apollo in the brig are tense because of Apollo's disappointment that Roslin failed to back him up when he defied the coup in \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\". Apollo expresses this disappointment in a scene deleted from \\"The Farm\\".Battlestar Galactica DVD, season 2.0, disc 2, \\"The Farm\\" deleted scenes. Production Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) and William Adama (Edward James Olmos) in a flashback. Efforts to make the actors appear decades younger were met with dissatisfaction. The second-season premiere was initially going to be set in the distant past, leaving unaddressed the cliffhanger that ended the previous season. \\"Scattered\\" would have been the second season's second episode and would have included the action on Kobol and Caprica shown in \\"Valley of Darkness\\". After this idea was abandoned, the writers considered opening the episode with the deleted flashback in which Adama and Tigh first met. Several flashbacks providing background on Adama and Tigh's relationship were filmed, but the production team felt that the flashbacks fit poorly into the series's tone. Also, they did not want to recast younger actors to play Adama and Tigh but were unsatisfied by the efforts to make actors Edward James Olmos and Michael Hogan appear decades younger. The final version has fewer, shorter flashbacks intended to focus mostly on Tigh's character. Several of the abandoned flashbacks are included as deleted scenes on the DVD.Battlestar Galactica DVD, season 2.0, disc 1, \\"Scattered\\" deleted scenes. The flashback in which military police find a drunken Tigh in his hotel room and tell him Adama has gotten him reinstated is an homage to the film Apocalypse Now. \\"Scattered\\" was the first episode of Battlestar Galactica broadcast in North America that used music over the main credits that had previously been used only in the UK broadcasts. According to Moore, everyone involved in the show preferred the UK version. \\"Scattered\\" omits the montage of upcoming scenes that followed the credits in first-season episodes, both because of time considerations and in response to criticism of the montages. The idea of Galactica and the fleet being separated after a jump was one of the original log lines Moore submitted to the Sci Fi network before the networked picked up Battlestar Galactica. Several shots of Tigh walking the corridors of Galactica appearing in \\"Scattered\\" were actually filmed for the second season's fourth episode, \\"Resistance\\". The production team needed the shots in \\"Scattered\\" to intercut with one of Tigh's flashbacks. Several shots in the space battle scene appeared first in the miniseries. The dialogue among Tyrol, Cally, and Tarn before they are ambushed by Cylons was improvised by the actors. Moore saw Tarn's death as commentary of the ugliness of war. Asked in a December 2005 interview what was the most difficult scene in the series to shoot, actor Aaron Douglas (Tyrol) said, \\"The scenes where someone dies in the Chief's arms are difficult to do because they take a really long time to shoot and you are constantly in a state of loss and sadness. They are very draining.\\" Reception \\"Scattered\\" was reviewed favorably by critics. Robert Bianco of USA Today gave \\"Scattered\\" three and a half stars out of four. Susan Tankersley of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A, finding the jumping dilemma contrived but saying the space battle \\"look[ed] fantastic.\\" Kevin McDonough of the Intelligencer Journal praised the episode's incorporation of scenes from multiple genres, including \\"a hospital operating- room drama, terrestrial combat action, political intrigue and your standard space dogfight conducted at warp speed.\\" Jason Davis of Mania gave it a B+, praising Hogan's acting and the flashbacks. Simon Brew of Den of Geek appreciated the visual device used to show the Cylons trying to penetrate Gaeta's firewall. Eric Goldman of IGN ranked Tigh taking command in \\"Scattered\\" and the following three episodes at #11 on his list of the top 20 storylines and moments in the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica. Connections to other series elements *The crew of Galactica discover and battle the intruding Cylon Centurions in the following episode, \\"Valley of Darkness\\". *Also in \\"Valley of Darkness\\", the medical supplies arrive too late, and Socinus dies. *In the episode \\"Flight of the Phoenix\\", it is revealed that a Cylon virus penetrated Galacticas computers despite Gaeta's firewall.

It aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on July 22, 2005. In the episode, Cylon Centurions board Galactica. The crew, led by Lee \\"Apollo\\" Adama, beat them back but suffer heavy casualties. On Kobol, Gaius Baltar's visions continue, and Chief Galen Tyrol euthanizes a dying comrade. On Caprica, Starbuck and Helo relax in Starbuck's apartment and then take her truck out of the city. According to executive producer Ronald D. Moore, production and post-production for \\"Valley of Darkness\\" was contentious. Nonetheless, critics reviewed it favorably. The episode received a nomination at the 2005 VES awards for the (animated) Centurions. Plot Having just jumped away from a battle with Cylons and rejoined the civilian fleet, a Cylon virus forces Galactica to switch to a limited emergency power as the crew fights off a boarding party of Cylon Centurions. Apollo releases President Roslin from the brig and she makes her way to sickbay just as the last of the Centurions are destroyed. With Galactica safe, Doctor Cottle makes his way to operate on a still-critical Commander Adama. On Kobol, Tyrol and Cally return to the rest of the stranded survey team with the medical kit they had retrieved for a wounded Socinus only to learn that his death is inevitable. Tyrol reluctantly euthanizes him with lethal dosage of painkillers. On Caprica, Starbuck and Helo stop at Starbuck's old apartment, where they listen to a recording of Starbuck's father playing the piano as Starbuck reflects on her life. They retrieve the keys to Starbuck's truck and escape the city in it. Symbolism In his podcast commentary on \\"Valley of Darkness\\", Moore discusses his views of the symbolism appearing in the episode. *He connects Baltar's dream about Adama killing the baby to episodes of infanticide in the Bible, such as the Massacre of the Innocents. The symbolism is intended to contextualize the magnitude of the threat to the baby Baltar is supposed to perceive. *Baltar comments that Six's description of human sacrifice on Kobol differs greatly from the accounts of the in-universe Scriptures, which describe the planet as a paradise. Moore connects this with the Biblical story of the Garden of Eden. As in the case of Eden, he says, humanity was driven out of paradise as divine punishment for its sins, except Kobol was home to \\"a more brutal, ugly kind of sin than simply getting some fruit off of some old tree that you weren't supposed to be snacking on.\\" Production Much of the action in \\"Valley of Darkness\\" set on Kobol and Caprica was originally written as part of \\"Scattered\\". This produced a script that was too long for one episode but too short for two. The Cylon boarding party plot was conceived to fill enough time for a full second episode. Chief Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) euthanizes Socinus (Alonso Oyarzun) as Seelix (Jennifer Halley) and Cally (Nicki Clyne) look on. This scene was controversial during production. Douglas described filming such scenes as \\"very draining\\" emotionally. According to Moore, the production and post- production for \\"Valley of Darkness\\" was unusually contentious; it and \\"The Farm\\" were the most contentious episodes of the second season. *After most of the shooting had concluded, the episode was viewed as too heavy. Moore and executive producer David Eick responded by adding scenes between Dee and Billy before and after the crisis. Moore felt that these \\"bookends\\" provide better context for their relationship at the expense of sense of urgency in the episode's first minutes. The scene between Tyrol and Cally and some extra time between Starbuck and Helo on Caprica were also added to lighten the mood. *The scene where Baltar sees Adama drowning his and Six's baby was controversial because of its perceived brutality, but Moore and Eick fought to keep it in the episode. Ultimately the scene was shot and edited to minimize the screen presence of the drowning itself. Moore acknowledged that the scene would disturb some viewers but enjoyed the way it advanced the show's mythos. *Socinus's death was controversial because of its emotional impact, but Moore considered it an important part of the episode. He had second thoughts about including it after learning that actor Aaron Douglas (Tyrol) had suffered a personal loss, but Douglas \\"really embraced it. He really wanted to do these scenes.\\" Asked in a December 2005 interview what was the most difficult scene in the series to shoot, Douglas said, \\"The scenes where someone dies in the Chief's arms are difficult to do because they take a really long time to shoot and you are constantly in a state of loss and sadness. They are very draining.\\" *Moore filmed a number of scenes between Tigh and Apollo that were ultimately deleted after filming. In one, a flashback gives Tigh the idea that the Centurions plan on venting the airlocks.Battlestar Galactica DVD, season 2.0, disc 1, \\"Valley of Darkness\\" deleted scenes. This was to be how Tigh recognized the strategy. Another deleted scene has an exchange between Apollo and CIC where Tigh tries to relieve Apollo of command. In a third deleted scene, Head Six tells Baltar that only he will live to see Earth. The piano piece Starbuck and Helo listen to is \\"Metamorphosis One\\" by Philip Glass. The end of the piece is featured at the end of the episode. Glass's music was often used for temp tracks during production of the series. The microcassette format she uses is an homage to the film A Clockwork Orange.Eick, David, and Moore, Ronald D. Commentary for \\"Pegasus\\" extended edition. Battlestar Galactica DVD, season 2.5, disc 1. When Tyrol and Cally rejoin the others, they use a countersign, a kind of challenge-response authentication, in which one party says \\"flash\\" and the other \\"thunder\\". These were the challenge and password, respectively, used by Allied soldiers on D-Day during World War II. Actress Katee Sackhoff (Starbuck) played a large role in planning the look and feel of Starbuck's apartment. She and actor Tahmoh Penikett (Helo) did much of the painting on the walls and the canvases strewn about the room. Reception \\"Valley of Darkness\\" received a Visual Effects Society Award nomination for its animated Cylon Centurions. \\"Valley of Darkness\\" received a nomination at the 2005 Visual Effects Society Awards for the Centurions, in the category \\"Outstanding Performance by an Animated Character in a Live Action Broadcast Program, Commercial, or Music Video\\". It lost to the following episode, \\"Fragged\\", which won for the Centurions in that episode. \\"Valley of Darkness\\" received favorable critical review. Jen Segrest of AOL's TV Squad commended the scenes between Starbuck and Helo and said the final confrontation with the Centurions was \\"a [scene] you'll want to rewatch a few times in slow mo.\\" Susan Tankersley of Television Without Pity gave \\"Valley of Darkness\\" a B+.

A large group or gang of students (between 100 and 200 according to witnesses) threw stones at windows, broke into shops to rob them, and attacked several people. The police detained 38 students. Similar incidents took place again in 2003, with about 50 students attempting to steal merchandise from shops. The police acted quickly this time, and detained 10 offenders.

It aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on July 29, 2005. It is the first episode in which Starbuck does not appear. In the episode, on Kobol, Crashdown leads an ill fated assault on a Cylon missile battery. Gaius Baltar frags Crashdown, to Head Six's approval, shortly before the survey team is rescued. On Galactica, Colonel Saul Tigh's gambit to discredit President Laura Roslin fails, and he declares martial law. \\"Fragged\\" received an award at the 2005 VES Awards for the (animated) Cylon Centurions appearing in the episode. Critics reviewed \\"Fragged\\" favorably. Plot In \\"Scattered\\", Head Six told Baltar that they would have a child. Crashdown ordered Specialist Tarn to retrieve medical supplies to treat the wounded Specialist Socinus, but Tarn died in a Cylon ambush. In \\"Valley of Darkness\\", Chief Galen Tyrol and Specialist Cally brought the supplies, but Socinus died anyway. Kobol Crashdown leads a brief funeral for Tarn and Socinus. Six tells Baltar that, because they died on Kobol, Tarn and Socinus have only oblivion waiting them. Later, Baltar asks why God would want to bring a child into a world so full of killing; Six replies that God wants to give humanity a chance at redemption. Tyrol observes Cylons building a missile battery, which he believes they will use to shoot down human search parties. Crashdown orders an attack on the battery despite the team's inexperience in combat and inadequate equipment. Tyrol privately tries to persuade him to instead attack the guidance system, which is less heavily guarded, but Crashdown waves the bloody shirt of Tarn and Socinus and pulls rank. Tyrol is unconvinced but nonetheless silences Baltar's protests during Crashdown's briefing. Six warns Baltar that one of the survivors will betray the others and that his life is in danger, because what happens on Kobol is not God's will. Crashdown refuses to change the plan even after discovering that the Cylons have reinforced the battery. Cally freezes up under pressure, and Crashdown threatens to kill her unless she obeys his orders. Baltar shoots Crashdown before he can carry out his threat; Six congratulates him. Tyrol destroys the Cylon guiding system in time to save the rescue Raptors, which in turn destroy the Cylons. The survivors cover up Crashdown's murder. Baltar despairs at the thought that killing rather than culture is humanity's legacy. Galactica Doctor Cottle arrives and operates on Commander William Adama, saving his life. Cottle is unavailable to provide Roslin with her cancer medication, and she undergoes severe withdrawal. A drunken Colonel Tigh lashes out at his subordinates. The Quorum of Twelve demands access to Roslin, who is still in Galacticas brig. Ellen Tigh persuades her husband to agree, believing the sight of Roslin's delirious condition will undermine her authority. The plan backfires after Roslin's Marine guard smuggles her medication. She denounces Adama's coup and convinces at least some of the Quorum that she is the leader foretold in their sacred scriptures who will guide humanity to Earth. Furious, Tigh dissolves the Quorum and declares martial law. Deleted scenes In a deleted scene, Roslin has a vision of arguing with Billy Keikeya about the Scriptures. Billy taunts her for her mistakes and then stabs her as the vision ends.Battlestar Galactica DVD, season 2.0, disc 1, \\"Fragged\\" deleted scenes. Analysis In a review of \\"Fragged\\", Jen Segrest of AOL's TV Squad discusses Baltar's character, calling his \\"descent into madness... tragic,\\" but also noting that the audience can identify with his guilt for allowing the Cylons into the Colonies' defense computers in the miniseries that served as the series's backdoor pilot. Segrest also notes how Baltar's instinct for self-preservation helps him defend himself and the other survivors against the Cylons and attributes his lie about Crashdown's death to \\"a bit of honor left in him\\". In another review, Jason Davis of Mania reflects on Head Six's comments about humanity's inclination toward killing, noting that Babylon 5 covered similar ground. He describes a difference between humans and Cylons in this regard: humans kill one another, while Cylons do not. Davis also proposes a mythology within the Battlestar Galactica universe, in which the humans killed their creators, the gods who once lived with them on Kobol, whether literally or in the sense of Nietzsche (God is dead). In Davis's view, \\"The Cylons, having reached a certain advanced point of development, now seek to do likewise\\" to their own creators, humanity. In his review of the episode \\"Home, Part 1\\", Davis compares the Cylons' journey with the events of Star Trek: The Motion Picture. In a January 2006 interview, executive producer Ronald D. Moore said of the Cylons, \\"they see themselves as the children of humanity, and their worldview says they‚Äôll never really achieve their full potential while their 'parents' are still alive\\".

Critical reaction to \\"Fragged\\" was favorable. Segrest reviewed the episode favorably, saying, \\"Anyone who thought the show would suffer a sophomore slump should be eating their words. This show doesn't just deserve a Hugo award, it deserves Emmys.\\" Davis gave \\"Fragged\\" an A and praised the performances of Michael Hogan (Tigh), Richard Hatch (Zarek), and Donnelly Rhodes (Cottle). Susan Tankersley of Television Without Pity gave \\"Fragged\\" a B. Eric Goldman of IGN ranked Tigh taking command at #11 on his list of the top 20 storylines and moments in the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica. He ranked Crashdown's failure of leadership at #12, commenting, \\"The entire storyline with these characters on Kobol provided the opportunity to elevate several members of the supporting cast in intriguing ways\\". Jackson Alpern of Maxim ranked Baltar fragging Crashdown as the 10th best moment in the series.

It aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on August 5, 2005. In the episode, Marines fire on civilians following Colonel Saul Tigh's declaration of martial law. President Laura Roslin and Lee \\"Apollo\\" Adama escape Galactica, Commander William Adama recovers, and Specialist Cally kills Galactica-Boomer. On Caprica, Starbuck and Helo join a human resistance group led by Sam Anders. Plot When civilian ships protest martial law, acting commander Tigh orders Marines to take withheld supplies by force. On the civilian ship Gideon, Marines open fire on a hostile but unarmed crowd of civilians, killing four. Fearing a split in the fleet, President Roslin and Apollo enlist help from Racetrack and Dualla to escape the brig, and go into hiding with Tom Zarek, Roslin's erstwhile political enemy. Tigh has Chief Galen Tyrol thrown in a cell with Boomer who has recently been found to be a Cylon. He then orders Baltar to determine whether he is also a Cylon. Instead, Baltar injects Tyrol with poison and demands that Boomer reveal the number of Cylon agents still secretly aboard the fleet. After Boomer guesses that there are eight agents, Baltar administers the antidote and later clears Tyrol of being a Cylon. On Caprica, Starbuck and Helo encounter humans who survived the initial Cylon attacks and formed a resistance group. After a firefight and a Mexican standoff, the two groups persuade each other they are not Cylons by discussing sports. Back on Galactica, a still-weak Commander Adama resumes command. Tigh confesses he has made mistakes, but Adama sympathizes with the pressures of command. An angry crowd gathers to witness Boomer's transfer to a specially-constructed holding cell. During the transfer, Specialist Cally shoots Boomer, who dies in Tyrol's arms declaring her love for him. Characterization In his podcast commentary on \\"Resistance\\", executive producer Ronald D. Moore discussed his views of what the episode's events reveal about several of the characters. *As in his commentary on the season premiere, \\"Scattered\\", Moore notes that Tigh proves that he is a poor leader when the fleet is not under attack. He is held back by his lack of political skill, his emotional reactions and Ellen's manipulation. Moore's \\"Scattered\\" podcast also mentions Tigh's drinking; Tigh is shown drinking numerous times in \\"Resistance\\". *Moore says that Ellen's manipulation is both conscious and unconscious. Ellen reacts to Saul's weakness by attacking. *According to Moore, Baltar's extortion in Boomer's cell is the beginning of a darkening of his character. Baltar hoped to continue his manipulation during the planned tests if Cally had not killed Boomer. *According to Moore, neither Roslin nor Apollo contemplated escape until the Gideon shooting. *Starbuck and Anders are each supposed to be able to tell intuitively that the other is not a Cylon. Moore says a character point like this is difficult to show onscreen and does not feel it came across in this case. *Over preceding episodes, Roslin's Marine guard, Corporal Venner, comes to believe she is a divinely appointed leader, and in \\"Resistance\\" he helps her escape the brig. Moore ascribes this both to the guard's background on a \\"fundamentalist\\" human colony but also to the general lack of a strong central authority since the destruction of the Colonies. The writers considered planning an expanded role for Venner in future episodes but decided against it. Analysis Moore notes that Tigh's actions in \\"Resistance\\" make it easy to think badly of him despite Tigh's positive contributions; Moore cites examples in the miniseries that served as the series's backdoor pilot and the episodes \\"33\\", \\"Scattered\\", and \\"Valley of Darkness\\". Moore suggests this raises questions about \\"the nature of heroism\\". Moore compares the shooting aboard the Gideon to the Boston Massacre. A group of ill-prepared soldiers, faced with a hostile mob, hears a shot fired and panics. Moore is careful to point out that who fires the first shot on the Gideon is unknown. Questioned by Ellen why Tigh did not shoot down Roslin's Raptor, Tigh replies, \\"It was his son.\\" However, Susan Tankersley of Television Without Pity argues Tigh would not have shot down Roslin's Raptor even if Apollo had not been aboard. In her analysis, Tigh is by now aware of the negative impacts of his bad decisions and unwilling to kill someone he knows is not truly his enemy. Tankersley also speculates things might have ended differently if Tigh were drunk, but in this scene he \\"seems sober.\\" In \\"Scattered\\", in return for parole, Apollo agreed not to \\"make any attempt to free [Roslin] or sow insurrection among the crew\\" while on duty. Moore is unsure whether Apollo's actions in \\"Resistance\\" constitute a parole violation, since he secures passage to the launching bay by telling his guards he is needed to help a Raptor Pilot. In Moore's view, the question is important for Apollo's character as \\"a point of honor\\". Jason Davis of Mania calls Apollo \\"mutinous\\". Two shots with blood dropping on the floor appear in the episode: one after Tigh interrogates Tyrol, and one after Boomer dies. Davis says this \\"recurring visual motif... continues the philosophical debate on what it means to be human/Cylon\\". Moore, Tankersley, Davis, Jen Segrest of AOL's TV Squad, Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity, and Simon Brew of Den of Geek compare Cally's actions in this episode to those of Jack Ruby. Production=Writing During development, \\"Resistance\\" was known as the \\"Kent State episode\\" because of how Tigh's heavy-handed tactics lead to civilian deaths. Moore later came to believe the incident bears greater resemblance to the Boston Massacre. Early plot outlines for \\"Resistance\\" included scenes in which Baltar would interrogate Boomer. The writers replaced these scenes with the Tyrol subplot after realizing that other characters would likely suspect Tyrol following his rescue from Kobol in the previous episode, \\"Fragged\\". Later the writers considered establishing a love triangle among Baltar, Boomer, and Six. In early drafts, Ellen was shown playing a direct role in running Galactica, giving orders and urging Saul to shoot down Roslin's Raptor in the CIC. The writers decided this was less believable than her indirect influence through manipulating Saul's emotions. Boomer's last words are, \\"I love you, Chief.\\" Moore had her call him by his title rather than his first name because Moore thinks \\"Galen\\" sounds funny and feared it would interfere with the audience's experience of the moment. For comparison he cited George Costanza's reaction in Seinfeld to learning that Kramer's first name is Cosmo. The writers had Billy decline to go with Roslin because actor Paul Campbell would be unavailable to shoot the next episode. Campbell was in Los Angeles filming a pilot for another series that was not picked up. Filming Director Allan Kroeker shot the first scene set on Caprica, in which the resistance fighters spot Starbuck and Helo and decide to kill them, is filmed from the resistance's perspective. He did this to provide a different flavor to a situation in which protagonists mistakenly target other protagonists, which Moore called \\"a very traditional plot move.\\" The shootout and standoff were filmed in one day, but because of safety issues and the complexity of the choreography it took, in Moore's words, \\"an ungodly amount of time.\\" The scenes in the launching bay before Roslin's escape were filmed in front of a green screen, as the crew did not have access to a large enough set. The blood drops in the shots at the beginning and end of \\"Resistance\\" are both CGI. Asked in a December 2005 interview what was the most difficult scene in the series to shoot, actor Aaron Douglas (Tyrol) said, \\"The scenes where someone dies in the Chief's arms are difficult to do because they take a really long time to shoot and you are constantly in a state of loss and sadness. They are very draining.\\" Connections to other series elements *The writers intended this episode's scenes between Apollo and Dee to hint at developments in their relationship planned for later in the second season. (Dee glances downward at Apollo as he exits one of these scenes.) In \\"Sacrifice\\", they go on a date. In Part 2 of \\"Lay Down Your Burdens\\" it is revealed that they marry during humanity's residence on New Caprica, before the Cylon occupation. Seeing the characters' dynamic in \\"Resistance\\" convinced Moore to develop their relationship. Reception \\"Resistance\\" received favorable critical review. In a positive review, Segrest especially praised actor James Callis (Baltar). Tankersley gave \\"Resistance\\" a B, praising Callis and the scenes between the Tighs, but criticizing the scenes on Caprica as alternately confusingly frantic and boring. Davis praised the performances of actors Michael Hogan (Saul Tigh) and Kate Vernon (Ellen Tigh), and the episode's treatment of \\"the dangers and moral uncertainty underlying any breaking of the chain of command\\". Davis compared Battlestar Galactica favorably to Babylon 5 in this regard. Brew also reviewed the episode favorably, expressing appreciation for the focus on conflicts among humans rather than between human and Cylon. Eric Goldman of IGN ranked Tigh taking command at #11 on his list of the top 20 storylines and moments in the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica.

Back in Slovakia, he passed his matura and started to study Slovak language and literature in Bratislava. He was excluded by the Communists from the school for being \\"politically unreliable\\". He was rehabilitated in 1960 and finished his studies in Prague. He was an employee of the Slovak Academy of Sciences from 1962 and after the Velvet Revolution (in 1990) became the director of its Institute of World Literature.  Political career  As a member of the HZDS party, which won the elections in 1992, he was Slovakia's Minister of Culture from 1992 to 1994. Afterwards (1994 - 2001), he was deputy to the parliament (National Council of the Slovak Republic) for his party and from 1994 - 1998 the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the parliament. In 1992, he was involved in the legal case Feldek vs. Slobodn√≠k (see ƒΩubom√≠r Feldek for details).  Work  He translated modern Russian, English and French literature (e.g. Isaac Asimov's Foundation) into Slovak. He described his experience in the Russian gulag in the book Paragraf:Pol√°rny kruh (Section:Polar Circle; 1991). He specialised in modern world literature. Theoretical problems are dealt with e.g. in the book Vedeck√© a liter√°rne poznanie (Scientific and Literary Knowledge; 1988), and in the monographs Gen√©za a poetika science fiction (Genesis and Poetics of Science Fiction; 1981) and Te√≥ria a prax b√°snick√©ho prekladu (Theory and Practice of Poetical Translation; 1990).

It aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on August 12, 2005. It is the first episode of the series in which the A plot is set on Caprica. In the episode, Cylons capture Kara \\"Starbuck\\" Thrace and hold her in an abandoned hospital, where they are performing experiments with human reproduction. Starbuck escapes and leaves Caprica to return to the human fleet. Commander William Adama returns to command of the fleet, but President Laura Roslin persuades almost a third of the fleet to follow her back to Kobol. According to executive producer Ronald D. Moore, the production process for \\"The Farm\\" was one of the most contentious of the second season. Starbuck's portrayal in \\"The Farm\\" has attracted academic study. Critical reaction was mixed. Plot=Caprica Starbuck wakes up with Sam Anders. He tries to persuade her to stay on Caprica, but she insists on returning to Galactica. She recommends the resistance give up fighting, move to higher ground, and wait for her to return with a rescue party. Cylons ambush the resistance as they make plans to capture a Cylon Heavy Raider. Starbuck is shot and loses consciousness. She wakes in a hospital, where a doctor named Simon tends her. Simon explains that Anders brought her to the hospital but later died from a shrapnel wound. Simon laughingly dismisses Starbuck's suspicion that he is a Cylon and explains away her other concerns. He presses the idea that Starbuck have a baby, calling child-bearing women \\"a very precious commodity to us.\\" Starbuck demurs. Meanwhile, Anders, very much alive, leads a search party. Caprica-Boomer appears and promises to take them to Starbuck. Starbuck is kept heavily sedated. She is suspicious after an unplanned emergency surgery following a pelvic examination, and her suspicions are confirmed when Simon calls her \\"Starbuck\\", a name she never revealed to him. Starbuck fakes sedation and sneaks out of her room, where she sees Simon talking to a Number Six copy. When Simon returns, Starbuck kills him by stabbing him with a fragment from a broken mirror. Searching for a way out, she discovers other captured human women, attached to machines. One woman Starbuck recognizes, a member of the resistance named Sue-Shaun, says they have become \\"baby machines\\" and \\"can't live like this.\\" Starbuck breaks the Cylon equipment, killing the women. Fleeing, she encounters another copy of Simon, confirming that he is a Cylon. The resistance rescues Starbuck with the aid of Boomer, who provides close air support from a Heavy Raider. Boomer explains that the Cylons have had no success reproducing on their own and are trying to reproduce with humans. Appalled, Starbuck volunteers to stay and help liberate these so-called \\"Farms\\". Anders reminds her of her mission, and she reiterates her promise to return with rescue, giving him her dog tags. He promises to liberate as many of the \\"Farms\\" as possible. She departs in the stolen Heavy Raider with Boomer and Helo to return to the human fleet. The human fleet Commander Adama returns to command and orders a ship-by-ship search for Roslin and Lee \\"Apollo\\" Adama, who are still on the run. After Apollo finds himself unable to go through with Tom Zarek's suggestion that he denounce his father publicly, Roslin sends a message to the fleet asking anyone who believes in the prophecies to follow her to Kobol. Commander Adama dismisses the message as \\"religious crap\\" and is astonished when almost a third of the fleet follows her. Chief Galen Tyrol says Galactica-Boomer was just a machine, but Commander Adama insists she was more than that. Nonetheless Adama explains to Tyrol that Specialist Cally will spend 30 days in the brig for unlawful discharge of a firearm (so not explicitly for murder). He also reminds Tyrol that the human-looking Cylons are made in many copies, so Tyrol will see Boomer again eventually, although that sounds more like a menace than a promise. Adama views Boomer's corpse in the morgue and weeps over her. Deleted scenes In a deleted scene, Apollo explains his refusal to denounce his father by telling Roslin that he was disappointed that she did not back him up when he mutinied to protect her in \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\". In his view, he has defied his father enough, and the struggle now belongs to Roslin. In another deleted scene, he promises to stick with Roslin regardless of the consequences of their imminent departure from the fleet.Battlestar Galactica DVD, season 2.0, disc 2, \\"The Farm\\" deleted scenes. Characterization In his podcast commentary on \\"The Farm\\", Moore discusses his views of what the episode's events reveal about several of the characters. * Following Adama's brush with death, he returns to command with his \\"emotions... closer to the surface.\\" This marks a change in his character that the writers intended to affect Adama for the rest of the second season. The change is manifest in this episode in his speech returning to the CIC and his angry reaction to Roslin's message. Roslin notices the change and Adama acknowledges it in a scene deleted from \\"Home, Part 2\\".Battlestar Galactica DVD, season 2.0, disc 2, \\"Home, Part 2\\" deleted scenes. * When Adama asks Tyrol questions about his feelings for Boomer, he is also asking them of himself, internally. His conflict over her comes to a head when he views her body. Executive producer David Eick said in a later podcast that actor Edward James Olmos (Adama) told him following shooting the morgue scene that he expected Adama would try to kill Boomer if he ever saw her again. * Starbuck's relationship with Anders is consistent with her character: she \\"sleeps [with] who she feels like sleeping with and makes no apologies for it.\\" However, her emotional reaction to Simon telling her of Anders's death proves that she does have genuine feelings for him. * At the start of the episode, Anders wants Starbuck to stay, but Starbuck remains focused on her mission. By the end, Starbuck's fury over her violation has changed her mind, but Anders reminds her that she has to leave. * Roslin chooses to \\"play the religion card\\" and is surprised at the effects: people of faith in the fleet start treating her differently, with reverence. Moore says she will later come to regret her choice. Amanda Keith of Los Angeles Newspaper Group attributes to Adama \\"a serious case of PTSD and a lot of misdirected rage.\\" Susan Tankersley of Television Without Pity writes of Adama reminding Tyrol that Boomer would return, \\"it's not clear if Adama is trying to warn Tyrol, or comfort him. Probably a bit of both.\\" Analysis Scholars have considered how \\"The Farm\\" approaches reproduction sociologically. Ingvil Hellstrand argues that the episode \\"raises issues of reproduction as a gendered imperative, where fertile women have a moral obligation or duty to reproduce.\\" In this context, she identifies Starbuck with the desire for individual agency and Simon with \\"state-regulated biopolitics\\". In this regard, Starbuck is \\"both anti-natalist and techno-critical\\". The conflict between freedom and control is not presented in the series as strictly between human and Cylon; Roslin outlaws abortion in the human fleet twelve episodes later, in \\"The Captain's Hand\\". Lorna Jowett argues that the Farm exists within a context of \\"masculinized science\\" in which a man (Simon) controls reproduction and the women are viewed as baby-making machines. Susan A. George argues that the Cylons are seeking to absorb the captive human women into a kind of biological machine. Scholars have also identified real-world contemporary issues around reproduction discussed in \\"The Farm\\". In Jowett's view the Cylon \\"desperation to reproduce\\" reflects contemporary human anxieties. Hellstrand connects Starbuck's presentation as a career-focused white woman choosing to remain childless with contemporary demographics in Europe and the United States. In this context, Simon's appeals to Starbuck correspond to attempts by governments in these areas to increase fertility rates. Hellstrand also notes that Starbuck's character is modeled on her male counterpart in the original Battlestar Galactica, but only the female Starbuck is forced to explain her career- oriented lifestyle choices. Jowett notes that the \\"image of women hooked up to machines for reproduction\\" can be found in other works of science fiction, citing the television series Dark Angel and the film Alien Resurrection. Kieran Tranter cites the Dune franchise as an additional precedent. Hellstrand compares Starbuck's destruction of the Cylon facility to Ellen Ripley's destruction of clones of herself in Alien Resurrection, saying that both characters \\"feel violated by an authority pushing for scientific advancements linked to their reproductive ability.\\" In Hellstrand's analysis, like Ripley, Starbuck destroys versions of herself that represent an unacceptable transgression against her reproductive rights. Hellstrand compares Starbuck's violent action with Boomer's decision in the third-season episode \\"Rapture\\" to die so she can be resurrected and rescue her child from the other Cylons. Patrick B. Sharp examines \\"The Farm\\"'s presentation of Starbuck as a female soldier. In particular, he contrasts Starbuck, who seeks to be an excellent soldier and uses violence to accomplish her objectives, with female soldiers in other works of fiction, such as G.I. Jane, which he says present violence as incidental to their jobs rather than essential to their characters. Euthanizing the captive women demonstrates how seriously Starbuck and the other female resistance fighters take their roles as soldiers: they \\"would rather die than be forced to become mothers.\\" Sharp also compares Starbuck's ordeal of being captured during war and treated in a strange hospital to Jessica Lynch's experience during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Keith argues that the episode inspires a measure of sympathy for the Cylons. In her view, their inability to reproduce is lamentable by itself, but it is made sadder by the fact that it precludes them from following their God's commandments. Moore notes a reversal of gender roles in Starbuck's promise to return for Anders. In his view it is more traditional in stories for a man to promise to rescue a woman. Production \\"The Farm\\" was controversial among the production team, some of whom feared that the episode was too dark and would drive away female viewers. This was considered especially important because of female viewers' historical reluctance to embrace science fiction. According to Moore, among the episodes of the second season, only \\"Valley of Darkness\\" may have had as contentious a production process. The decision to suggest that Simon had given Starbuck a pelvic exam was particularly controversial. The outline of the episode remained largely the same from its conception. The largest change was for Starbuck to be unsure at first whether she is in a Cylon facility. According to Moore, the writers never believed they could fool the audience entirely into thinking Simon was human; rather, they sought to introduce ambiguity and then resolve it. The first scene with Roslin and Apollo shows them hiding in cold storage aboard a civilian ship. Moore originally conceived for them to hide in a meat locker among \\"the last brisquets, burgers, filets, and pot roasts left in the universe\\" as a reminder of the magnitude of humanity's loss. When every meat locker art director Doug McLean scouted in Vancouver, where Battlestar Galactica was filmed, proved too small or too cold to film in, production designer Richard Hudolin built the cold storage room on a set with a window that would suggest a meat locker in the next room. The scene in which the resistance encounters Sharon was written as a night scene but was filmed during the day for production reasons. Also, a scene showing the bloody aftermath of Caprica-Sharon's capture of the Heavy Raider was cut due to time constraints. The shots of the resistance boarding the Heavy Raider were all done with a green screen and a corresponding green ramp. When Starbuck is shot, a wound on her eyebrow switches from the right to the left side of her face in an apparent mistake. In fact, the shot in which the switch occurs is a mirror image, as evidenced from the position of the steering wheel in the truck behind her. According to Moore, this was not a mistake but a deliberate editing choice to reflect the psychological trauma Starbuck undergoes. Starbuck leaves one of her dog tags behind with Anders at the end of the episode. Actress Katee Sackhoff (Starbuck) came up with this as a way for the character to demonstrate her commitment to return to Anders. Reception Critical reaction to \\"The Farm\\" was mixed. Jason Davis of Mania gave the episode an A+, praising the writing's \\"elegance and economy\\" and writing that Sackhoff \\"never ceases to astonish with the naturalness of her performance.\\" Simon Brew of Den of Geek also commended Sackhoff's acting and added that \\"The Farm\\" \\"was as good an episode as I've seen thus far of Battlestar Galactica.\\" Writing retrospectively several months after the episode aired, Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity also praised Sackhoff's acting and compared the episode as a whole favorably to the episodes \\"Litmus\\", \\"Final Cut\\", and \\"Scar\\"; he gave the last of these an A-. Tankersley gave \\"The Farm\\" a B- and wrote of the pelvic exam, \\"Gack. This scene's kind of short on things I feel comfortable making jokes about, honestly.\\" Keith called actor Rick Worthy (Simon) \\"criminally underused\\" and wrote, \\"First time through, I didn't think of a lot of this episode, but in hindsight, it packs a lot of character moments into what is essentially an action episode.\\" Connections to other series elements * The Cylons' inability to reproduce biologically, revealed in \\"The Farm\\", is the reason for their cultivation of the relationship between Helo and Caprica-Boomer in the first season. * In \\"The Farm\\", Caprica-Boomer reiterates the contention Leoben Conoy made in \\"Flesh and Bone\\" that Starbuck has a special destiny. * Eick used Olmos's prediction of Adama's reaction to seeing Boomer again to help craft Adama's encounter with Caprica-Boomer in \\"Home, Part 2\\". * Starbuck returns to Caprica and rescues Anders and the resistance, as promised, in the second-season finale, \\"Lay Down Your Burdens\\".

Background German forces invaded Greece and southern Yugoslavia from Bulgaria in the first week of April 1941. Following the collapse of resistance in Yugoslavia, the left flank of the Vermion line held by Greek and British Empire forces became exposed. A new plan intended that Imperial British forces would hold off Germans forces in western Macedonia, until non-motorised Greek infantry units had withdrawn on foot from Mount Vermion to Mount Siniatsiko, and a new defensive line had been formed between Mount Olympus and the Aliakmon River.Australian War Memorial (AWM), no date, \\"Battle of Vevi (Veve) 9 April 1941 ‚Äì 12 April 1941\\" Downloaded 24 August 2006.Australian Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA), 2001, \\"The roof is leaking: Vevi and Sotir 9‚Äì14 April 1941\\".

During April 1941, conditions at the top of the pass were \\"bitterly cold\\"; rain turning into snowstorms. These hindered the ability of the Allied infantry to sleep, especially the Australians and New Zealanders ‚Äì who were tired after a long and sudden journey from North Africa, and were not experienced in or equipped for wintry, mountain conditions. Mackay Force was deployed in two sub-sectors: Greek forces around the town of Kelli, east of the pass and British Empire forces at the pass (Kirli Derven) itself.accessed 14.4.2011 The British Empire's units occupying Kirli Derven itself were comprised predominantly of Brigadier George Vasey's Australian 19th Infantry Brigade: the 2/4th (minus one company) and 2/8th Battalions, complemented by the British 9th Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps (also known as the 1st Rangers). The infantry were supported by parts of the New Zealand 27th (Machine Gun) Battalion, the Australian 2/1st Anti-Tank Regiment, the British 2nd Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery and other smaller elements of Australian and British artillery units. Vasey's headquarters were located a substantial distance away, approximately south of the town of Klidi. Around the pass, Vasey's three infantry battalions were spread across a -wide front: the 2/8th was on the ridge to the east of the pass, the 1st Rangers was on a north-facing spur on the western side, and the 2/4th was to the west of the Rangers, on Golema Glava height ). New Zealand machine gunners were distributed among the infantry. Australian and British artillery units were concentrated in the pass itself. The Kelli sub-sector was covered by a Greek brigade-level force, primarily the Dodecanese Regiment (three battalions totaling 3,500 personnel), which was reinforced by the Greek X Border Sector (500 personnel), three Greek artillery batteries (one mountain artillery, one field artillery and one anti-tank artillery battery equipped with field guns), one sapper (engineer) company and one machine gun company. The total strength of the Greek force ‚Äì under Colonel Sergios Aristotelis ‚Äì was about 5,000 personnel and 15 guns.Œ§Œø Œ§Œ≠ŒªŒøœÇ ŒúŒπŒ±œÇ ŒïœÄŒøœÄŒøŒπŒØŒ±œÇ, ŒîŒôŒ£, ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±Œπ 1959, page 24 The 3rd Battalion, Dodecanese Regiment (III/Dod.) was deployed on the right flank of the British Empire' units, on Delinski Dol heights ), followed by I/Dod., II/Dod. and X Border Sector to the far right. Two 75mm guns were deployed in the antitank role between III/Dod. and I/Dod., controlling the road that passed through the village of Kelli. Immediately west of Mackay Force and covering its left flank, across Radosi heights (Mala Reka ridge), were the 350 personnel of the Greek I/88 (1st Battalion, 88th Regiment; 21st Brigade), part of the Greek Cavalry Division. German The German forces detailed for the attack on Klidi Pass belonged to the 9th Panzer Division and LSSAH. During the rapid advance through south Yugoslavia, 9th Panzer had formed a Vorausabteilung Appell (Vor.Abt. Apell; \\"advance guard formation\\") under the commander of the 9th Motorised Infantry Brigade (Sch√ºtzen-Brigade), Oberst Wilhelm von Apell, which crossed into Greece together with the LSSAH. The action would also be supported by artillery from XL Corps' assets. The Vor.Abt. Apell, on the right flank, consisted of the following units: *staff, 9th Mot. Infantry Brigade; *9th Reconnaissance battalion; *I./11 Sch√ºtzenbattalion; *II./102 Artillerie Battalion minus the 6th battery; *one battery, 86 FlaK Battalion; *one company, 50 Panzerj√§ger Battalion and; *one company, 86 Panzerpioner Battalion. From XL Corps' assets, II./37 Schwere-Artillerie-Battalion (2/37th Heavy Artillery Battalion) ‚Äì with 12 150 mm guns ‚Äì along with a battery from the 29th Observation Battalion, had the mission of counter-battery fire. LSSAH placed its battalions as follows: on the right the reinforced I./LSSAH: Kampfgruppe Witt (KG Witt) was to attack Vevi Pass frontally, and on the left the reinforced III./LSSAH would attack the recognised Schwerpunkt (focal point) of the battle, to achieve a breakthrough from Kelli toward Amyntaio. Battalion II./LSSAH, minus its 7th and 8th Companies,) would stay in Florina as a reserve securing the area from south and west. The reconnaissance group (under Kurt Meyer) was initially ordered to link up with 2nd Panzer Division near Edessa, although this plan later changed, so that the reconnaissance group would pursue the Allies toward Sotir after the pass was opened. To support KG Witt, V./LSSAH (a \\"Heavy Battalion\\") detached 15 tracked self-propelled artillery pieces, comprising its battery of six Sturmgesch√ºtz III (StuG III) assault guns (75 mm) and its Panzerj√§ger company of nine Pz.Jg. I (47 mm gun). The LSSAH pioneer battalion would stand behind KG Witt waiting for orders (ie. to clear mines and repair damage on the road). One light howitzer battery would provide direct support to III./LSSAH, and a heavy howitzer battery to KG Witt. The LSSAH artillery regiment, minus a 88 mm Flak battery, would coordinate its actions with KG Witt. Sturmbannf√ºhrer Fritz Witt led KG Witt, which was composed of: * the reinforced infantry battalion I./LSSAH; * the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th and 8th Infantry Companies from II./LSSAH; * the 4th Machine Gun Company from II./LSSAH; * two \\"light infantry weapons\\" platoons; * a \\"heavy infantry weapons\\" platoon; * three anti-tank platoons; * two engineer platoons; * a light field howitzer troop; * an 88mm Flak platoon, and; * a number of StuG III and Pz.Jg. I. (Allied infantry usually referred to the self-propelled guns as \\"tanks\\"; neither the Germans nor Allies believed that armoured vehicles would be able to climb the extremely rocky slopes surrounding the pass.) The dividing line between LSSAH and Vor.Abt. Apell was about two kilometres west of the Niki-Vevi-Klidi road and parallel to it. The missions assigned to them were: the LSSAH was to open the pass, while the Vor.Abt. Apell would move (after the LSSAH attack) from the area of Flambouron toward Aetos and Xino Nero (Eksisou), and the rear of the forces defending the pass.Œ§Œø Œ§Œ≠ŒªŒøœÇ ŒúŒπŒ±œÇ ŒïœÄŒøœÄŒøŒπŒØŒ±œÇ, ŒîŒôŒ£, ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±Œπ 1959, pages 23‚Äì24 Battle=Opening skirmishes On the Dodecanese Regiment's front at midnight (10/11 April), the Germans attempted reconnaissance patrols and probing attacks against Glava Hill, but were repelled after a two-hour battle. The Germans repeated these actions at 14:00 against Delinski Dol but were also warded off. The Waffen-SS did not probe the British Empire's front until the afternoon of 11 April. This included an encounter with Australian artillery positions on the main road; Captain Gordon Laybourne Smith of the 2/3rd Field Regiment later commented that the German commander had sent: \\"In all his insolence ... trucks down the main road ... to within 3,000 yards [~2,750 metres] of our infantry, and proceeded to debus [i.e. disembark]. At first I could not believe it was an enemy, all had been so still and quiet. Then came some sense. My orders flew over the wire and the first rounds screamed through the air... A few furious moments and back went the Hun [a derogatory term for Germans], but five trucks stayed in the road as silent witness that my troop could shoot\\". More prolonged skirmishes were directed at the positions of the 2/8th Battalion. These became more aggressive as night closed in. In the words of the Australian War Memorial: \\"[d]espite being strung out and exhausted from a long march to the position and bitterly cold weather, the 2/8th managed to fend them off.\\" By the morning of 12 April, fresh snow over deep lay on the hillsides. By dawn, many of the Australians and New Zealanders stationed in the Hills were suffering from frostbite and were unable to operate their weapons effectively. However, orders had now been issued for an orderly withdrawal to the Aliakmon line, to begin that evening. German main assault At 08:30 on 12 April (09:00 according to one German source), the main German attack was launched.). Without artillery preparation, the 1st Company of LSSAH, acting as the vanguard of KG Witt on its left flank, attacked the key Hill 997, which was occupied by a company of the 2/8th Battalion, under Captain Bill Robertson. After hard close fighting, by 11:00 they had captured the Hill, having in the process overrun an Australian platoon of which only six men survived. At 12.30 the 7th KG Witt' company extended the attack toward Hill 917 which it captured after strong resistance by 14:00. The Hill was defended by an Australian company under Captain Coombes at the far left of 2/8th's sector, near where it adjoined the 1st Rangers. According to the Australian official history, at 11:00 the 1st Rangers ‚Äì possibly believing that the 2/8th was retreating ‚Äì began to withdraw. This opened the pass itself to the Germans, created a gap between the 2/4th and 2/8th Battalions, severed communications between Vasey and the 2/8th and left Australian anti-tank guns without infantry protection. To the west of the battlefield, the Greek 21st Infantry Brigade reported at 12:00 that it had lost contact with the Australian 2/4 Battalion. At 13:00, the Dodecanese Regiment reported that the Australians of the 2/8th Battalion were retreating, although the Regiment itself had taken no such order yet. The two companies of the 2/8th Battalion on the western flank (Coombes' and Robertson's), were forced to retreat up the slopes. However, in the words of Australian official historian Gavin Long: \\"At 2:00 pm ... Lt.-Col. [John] Mitchell of the 2/8th ... ordered a counter-attack which regained some vital ground on top of the ridge... After six hours of intermittent fighting in the pass and on the slopes to the east, the 2/8th still held the Hills though their left had been mauled; the Rangers, however, were rallying astride the road about two miles to the rear, but five of the six supporting guns of the 2/1st Anti-Tank Regiment had been left without protection and abandoned. Thus the ridge held by the 2/8th formed a deep salient.\\" According to Long, Vasey was informed of the Rangers' withdrawal by officers from other units, but refused to believe it. The Dodecanese line began taking artillery fire at 14:30, concentrated mostly on Delinski Dol. In the west, the Greek 21st Brigade reported from 14:30 that groups of Australians were retreating south towards Xino Nero. From 14:35 a number of assault guns and Panzerj√§ger vehicles had arrived to support the 1st and 7th companies of KG Witt. Following the earlier German successes, the 2nd Company of LSSAH and a heavy machine gun platoon attacked west of the road, with the 3rd Company astride and left (east) of the road, the 7th Company attacking from Hill 917 to the west of Klidi village and the 1st Company from Hill 997 to the east of Klidi village. By 15:30, the 2nd and 3rd Companies had captured Hill 1009 in the 1st Rangers' sector, reducing British machine gun positions with heavy weapons. At 16:00 the forces fighting against KG Witt began to retreat and carried out demolitions on the road. KG Witt attacked forward, and pioneers coming behind the 3rd company started to open a corridor in the Allied minefield eventually allowing two assault guns (StuG) to pass through. Simultaneously, III/LSSAH and Vorausabteilung Apell began their attacks. The Allied escape movement  With German artillery fire on the Greek lines becoming more intense, at 15:40, Mackay ordered the Dodecanese Regiment to retreat immediately and to have completed the evacuation of its positions by 18:00 (bringing forward the withdrawal scheduled for 19:00). At 16:30, the Regiment began its withdrawal, after destroying its artillery pieces which could not be evacuated. When the Regiment began its retreat, it reported that no British Empire forces were to be seen in the Kirli Derven sector. According to German sources, III/LSSAH began its attack toward Kelli at 16:20. In the west at 16:00, the German attack was extended against the Greek 1/88th Battalion, which began taking artillery and mortar fire. Between 16:30 and 18:00, a force reported by the Greeks as elements of the German vanguard ‚Äì primarily the 9th Reconnaissance Battalion and the I/11 Sch√ºtzenBattalion ‚Äì concentrated against the battalion's sector (Radosi Hill), and came to assaulting distance, under harassing fire from the Greeks. The 2/8th had been exposed on two flanks by the Greek and British withdrawals; it was soon coming under German machine gun fire from the east. According to an official Australian account, Vasey \\"realised his men were not going to be able to stage an orderly withdrawal. At 17:00, he telephoned the commanding officer of the 2/4th Battalion ... with the code phrase indicating that a pull-out was now vital ‚Äì \\"the roof is leaking.\\" At 17:30, the Australian official history reported that 500 German infantry supported by self-propelled guns attacked in force along the width of the 2/8th's sector. A German participant of the battle, Obersturmbannfuhrer Kurt Meyer, wrote later of his surprise at how easily the heavy StuGs had climbed the slopes. \\"We watched the guns advance in amazement. They climbed higher and higher, and then joined the fight. Nobody [had] thought it possible to use them, but now they were up there, giving valuable support to the infantry. Completely shaken by the impression German shelling had made on them, British [sic] prisoners came down the mountain. They were tall, strong fellows and formidable opponents.\\" The self-propelled guns effectively sealed the Allies' defeat at Vevi. The 2/8th Battalion was forced into a chaotic retreat, with component units being separated and officers ordering the abandonment even of light weapons, to speed the withdrawal. Losses among the Australian infantry would have been much worse it were not for the 2/1st Anti-Tank Regiment and the British Royal Horse Artillery standing their ground in the centre, until the Germans were only away. According to German sources at 18:00 the 7th and 1st Companies of LSSAH captured the village of Klidi, having taken 82 prisoners. A little later the 3rd company captured the exit of the rail tunnel taking another 250 New Zealand, British and Australian prisoners. Both Greek and German sources agree that III/LSSAH was in Kelli at 18:15 and subsequently occupied vacant Greek positions, also reaching Petra by 20:15. However, German sources report that Greek units were still fighting to the far east at 20:00, when 40 Greek and 60 Australian prisoners were taken.Œ§Œø Œ§Œ≠ŒªŒøœÇ ŒúŒπŒ±œÇ ŒïœÄŒøœÄŒøŒπŒØŒ±œÇ, ŒîŒôŒ£, ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±Œπ 1959, page30Œ§Œø Œ£œçŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ± ŒîœâŒ¥ŒµŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒ∑œÉŒØœâŒΩ ¬ß134-136, 153 Allied defeat The early collapse of the British Empire's lines in the Klidi Pass, allowed German forces to advance south of the pass before the Dodecanese Regiment had completed its withdrawal to the west. Its right column (consisting of the III and I battalions, as well as the regimental HQ company) was attacked by \\"about 20 German tanks\\" (actually six StuG and nine PzJg I) at 18:00 west of Amyntaion, with fire from a distance of . The column was saved by the timely intervention of 25‚Äì30 British tanks that prevented their capture. In the west, the positions of the Greek 88th Regiment were assaulted at 18:30. After a brief uneven clash at close quarters, the Germans overran the 88th, which reeled back toward Aetos. According to Greek sources, an attempted counterattack was aborted when the 88th Regiment's commander was killed; however, German sources mention repulsing a Greek attack against the German right flank at 19:00 (which conforms to the actual disposition of forces, with the Greek regimental HQ south-west of the German attack). Meanwhile, to the east, at 19:00 the 12th and 13th companies of III/LSSAH marched over Hill 1202 (presumably Delinski Dol, noted in Greek maps as Hill 1200), to the east, while the 14th company west of Lake Petron to the village of Petres. The 2nd company attacked astride the road followed closely by the 3rd company, while the 1st and 7th came down from the Hills flanking the pass toward Sotir. At 21:00 operations stopped at a line extending from the east of Xino Nero almost to Sotir. At 20:00, the remnants of the Greek 88th Regiment had started to arrive at Aetos. It had suffered 11 killed, 18 wounded (including its commander) and 96 captured (some of them wounded). The Regiment began to reorganise, although its numbers were only sufficient to form one company. German casualties were reported by the Greeks as \\"heavy\\".Œ§Œø Œ§Œ≠ŒªŒøœÇ ŒúŒπŒ±œÇ ŒïœÄŒøœÄŒøŒπŒØŒ±œÇ, ŒîŒôŒ£, ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±Œπ 1959, page 28 German sources also report that elements of the Vorausabteilung Appell captured Hill 966 (Seveskeravi Hill) at 22:30 after hard fighting against Australians. However, the hill belonged to the Greek sector and is not mentioned in the Australian or Greek official histories. Aftermath The 2/8th Battalion was effectively destroyed as a fighting force for the rest of the Greek campaign. According to some accounts, at its fallback position of Rodona, the battalion could muster only 250 men, of whom only 50 had weapons. Although the 2/4th Battalion had been spared the brunt of the German assault at Vevi, it had 70 personnel taken prisoner at a German roadblock during its retreat to Sotir. The Germans claimed 480 \\"English\\" prisoners at Vevi for the loss of 37 dead, 95 wounded and two taken prisoner. For Witt, the victory was perhaps overshadowed by the death of his brother, also a member of LSSAH, whose vehicle drove over a mine during the battle. Gerhard Pleiss ‚Äì a platoon commander whose men captured the highest point ‚Äì was subsequently awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, the highest German award for bravery on the battlefield. A further 14 members of KGW received the Iron Cross First Class. Although it was defeated and suffered heavy losses, Mackay Force's actions at Vevi gained two days for the retreat and regrouping of Allied forces to the south. Despite this, by the time the Allied resistance at Klidi collapsed, the Greek 20th and 12th Divisions had yet to complete their withdrawal, and subsequently found themselves defending their resistance positions on the Mount Siniatsiko line (passes of Kleisoura, Vlasti and Siatista) in very disadvantageous terms. The Dodecanese Regiment, the most combat-worthy of the 20th Division's units, was scattered during the westward withdrawal, due to misunderstandings with the British who undertook their transport on lorries as the Regiment‚Äôs commander chose not to show up at the scheduled rendezvous with Battalion I and III, and remained as the reserve of the 20th Division for the remainder of the war.Œ§Œø Œ§Œ≠ŒªŒøœÇ ŒúŒπŒ±œÇ ŒïœÄŒøœÄŒøŒπŒØŒ±œÇ, pages 38-39Œ§Œø Œ£œçŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ± ŒîœâŒ¥ŒµŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒ∑œÉŒØœâŒΩ ¬ß139-151 The bulk of the 20th Division was still straggling westward towards Mt.

The party was the legal successor of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), following its dissolution by the 47th Party Congress due to the severe financial crisis following the Tangentopoli scandal. A minoritarian group of the congress, who proposed an autonomist and centrist solution against the PSI dissolution, instead founded the Reformist Socialist Party. History= Crisis of the Italian Socialist Party  1994 general election = In occasion of the 1994 general election and the introduction of the majoritarian electoral system of \\"Mattarellum\\", the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) of Ottaviano Del Turco joined the Alliance of Progressives coalition; however, the PSI obtained poor results compared to the main parties of the coalition: PSI received 2.2% of votes in the proportional quota for the Chamber of Deputies and the 0.3% for the Senate. However, PSI parliamentarians were elected in single-members districts according to the agreements within the centre-left coalition and, thanks to the majoritarian system, obtained 14 seats in the Chamber and 9 in the Senate. Due to their number, PSI deputies were forced to join the unitarian centre-left group \\"Progressives - Federative\\" (Progressisti - Federativo) while PSI senators managed to create their own autonomous group, thanks also to the adhesion of the Senator for life and former PSI National Secretary Francesco De Martino. =Exit of the Labourist faction from PSI= After the disappointing outcome of the elections, Del Turco resigned as secretary and the PSI Directive Committee appointed Valdo Spini as national coordinator on 21 June 1994, giving him the task to organise the Extraordinary Congress of the Party until September of the same year. However, Spini was convinced that PSI had to change its entire identity, which was associated with corruption after the role of the party in the Tangentopoli scandal,An example of the political satire of PSI was the headline of the number 8/9 of the satirical magazine Cuore of 30 March 1991, which reads Scatta l'ora legale, panico tra i socialisti (\\"The legal time begins, panic among socialists\\"). and he convened a meeting on 26 July 1994 in order to promote the \\"Labourist Constituent\\". On 22 September, Spini resigned as coordinator and formed the Labour Federation on 5 November 1994 in Florence and much of parliamentarians, who were elected among Socialist lists, joined this new political formation and left the PSI, deepening its financial crisis. = Last PSI Congress = In a climate of high tension, the 47th Congress of the Italian Socialist Party was held in Rome in November 1994 and saw the participation of Socialist delegates who decided to not follow Spini into his new Labour Federation party. The majoritarian side of the Congress, which was supported by former PSI Secretary Ottaviano Del Turco and Enrico Boselli, proposed the liquidation of the Party due to its disastrous financial situation and the creation create a new political formation called \\"Socialisti Italiani\\". The minoritarian side, supported by Fabrizio Cicchitto e da Enrico Manca, was instead against to the dissolution of PSI. At the end, the congress decided to liquidate the PSI, considering the debts accumulated during the rule of former Prime Minister Bettino Craxi and the decline of subscriptions and contributions which led to the foreclosing of various properties belonging to the PSI.  Foundation of Italian Socialists  Enrico Boselli in 2007. Despite the sadness for the closure of the historical Italian Socialist Party after 102 years of activity, all delegates wanted to continue and preserve the history and the identity of PSI: after a few hours, the new \\"Italian Socialists\\" (SI) was proclaimed as the official successor party to the PSI and its traditions. Delegates of the new party elected Enrico Boselli as Secretary and Gino Giugni as President, with the indication to keep the party among the democratic left. At the Chamber, 11 deputies, of whom 9 elected for the PSI, joined the Labour Federation; the five remaining PSI deputies (Giuseppe Albertini, Enrico Boselli, Ottaviano Del Turco, Gino Giugni and Alberto La Volpe) decided instead to join the Italian Socialists. They left the \\"Progressives\\" parliamentary group and formed a united group called \\"The Democrats\\" (I Democratici) on 21 February 1995, along with some members of the Segni Pact and Democratic Alliance. At the Senate, the Socialist group was preserved but most of its members joined the Labour Federations, and only senators Maria Rosaria Manieri and Cesare Marini adhered to SI.  First elections  At the 1995 regional elections, the Italian Socialists formed a list with the Democratic Alliance and Segni Pact called the Pact of Democrats. The coalition obtained 4.2% of the vote and 33 regional councillors, mostly Socialists. However, the alliance was dissolved shortly after the election due to the good results achieved only by SI. For the 1996 general election, the Italian Socialists joined the electoral list of Italian Renewal (RI), a newly formed liberal-centrist party led by Lamberto Dini, within The Olive Tree centre-left coalition. SI participated then to the electoral victory of the centre-left: RI obtained the 4.3% of vote for the Chamber while The Olive Tree list obtained the 39.9% of votes for the Senate. The Italian Socialists had 7 deputies (Giuseppe Albertini, Enrico Boselli, Enzo Ceremigna, Giovanni Crema, Leone Delfino, Sergio Fumagalli and Roberto Villetti) and 5 senators (Livio Besso Cordero, Ottaviano Del Turco, Giovanni Iuliano, Maria Rosaria Manieri and Cesare Marini). Del Turco was nominated as the group's senate leader. However, the federation with RI did not last long, disbanding on 21 December 1996, with the exit from the parliamentarian group in the Chamber by Socialist deputies, who joined the component of Italian Socialists in the Mixed Group. Socialist senators in turn left the parliamentarian group of the Senate on 6 February 1997, determining the dissolution of RI. They instead joined the Mixed Group the Senate, forming the component of Italian Socialists and the one of \\"Italian Democratic Socialists\\" (SDI) on 9 November 1998.  Merger with the SDI  On 10 May 1998 and under the proposal of Party Secretary Boselli, the Italian Socialists merged with the SDI, along with a segment of the Socialist Party (led by Ugo Intini), Labour Federation (led by Alberto Benzoni) and the remains of the Italian Democratic Socialist Party (led by Gianfranco Schietroma).

The song is an instrumental ambient track that was spontaneously improvised by bassist Adam Clayton and guitarist the Edge while producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois recorded, unbeknownst to the band. It has never been performed live, although Clayton did play it as a warm-up during a soundcheck before U2's concert in San Jose on 20 April 2001. Description \\"4th of July\\" came about almost entirely through a moment of inspiration from Eno. At the end of a studio session, Eno happened to overhear Adam Clayton doodling on a simple bass figure; he liked what he was hearing, so recorded it ad hoc as it was being played. Guitarist The Edge happened to join in, improvising a few guitar ideas over the top of Clayton's bass; neither knew they were being recorded. Eno added some treatments and then transferred the piece straight to two-track master tape ‚Äì and that was the song finished, with no possibility of further overdubs.Stokes, Niall, Into the Heart: The Stories Behind Every U2 Song. U2 called it \\"4th of July\\" to commemorate the birth of Edge's daughter, Hollie, Bono's godchild, who was born on that date, right in the middle of making the album. It is the only instrumental song on a regular full-length U2 album (not including Passengers). It was frequently used as the last song played before U2 took the stage during the Unforgettable Fire Tour. The song is regularly played on Music Choice's \\"Sounds of the Seasons\\" channel when playing patriotic music in the days leading to (and during) the Fourth of July holiday.

The statute provides that with 14 specified exceptions, \\"no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed\\". History The Anti-Injunction Act was originally enacted as , ¬ß 10. The modern equivalent was enacted on August 16, 1954, as section 7421(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (now the 1986 Code).Internal Revenue Code of 1954, sec. 7421(a), printed at (Aug. 16, 1954). Analysis This rule is related to the Flora full payment rule, based in part on the United States Supreme Court decision in Flora v. United States,, affirmed on rehearing, . essentially requiring that in most cases a person resisting the assessment of a U.S. federal tax must first pay the full amount of tax asserted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and then file a formal administrative claim for refund with the IRS. As a general rule, the courts will not entertain a suit to enjoin (or stop) the government from assessing the tax but will entertain a suit for a tax refund after the IRS has denied the refund claim, or 6 months have elapsed (120 days in bankruptcy cases) since the filing of the claim, whichever is earlier.See ; ; . For the exception allowing litigation without first paying the tax in bankruptcy cases, see . For income taxes and certain other taxes, the taxpayer may also litigate the tax in the United States Tax Court prior to assessment without first paying the tax.See generally . Impact In the case of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, in which the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was at issue, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the mandate imposed under that law. The Court also determined the applicability of the Tax Anti-Injunction Act to the litigation over the law.. The Court held that the individual mandate in that statute (codified in Internal Revenue Code section 5000A as a \\"penalty\\") does not fall under the Tax Anti-Injunction Act, on the rationale that Congress specifically labeled consequences of the mandate as a \\"penalty\\" rather than a \\"tax\\", whereas other portions of the Act were labeled as a \\"tax\\". The Court also ruled that the nature of the mandate does not preclude the federal courts from hearing the case before a prospective plaintiff has paid such a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service in the year 2015. In this case, the mandate was ruled to be constitutional as a valid exercise of the congressional taxing power.

His films  His films include: Hobby mou... o Viasmos (My hobbies include... Rape), O Skyllas (The Dog-man), I Lires tou Antarti (The Guerrilla's bullions) (Italics indicate a romanization of the Greek title, while parentheses indicate a literal translation into English). They were shot with very low production values, somewhat ineptly and were intended for public screening in caf√©s of cities and towns of northern Greece that belonged to friends of his. His films' leads were always characters characteristically flawed, marginalized, criminals, ostracised by the law, yet striving for ideals such as atonemenent, redemption, or love. Or, predators, monsters bent on revenge on Hoi polloi, out to satisfy their most base desires. People who lived in the worst of conditions, in sleaze and decaying urban hubs, under suspicion and distrust, who faced horrible, powerful villains, the threat of the often corrupt police. Ex convicts, rapists, smugglers, they were very close to the definition of an anti-hero, offbeat heroes covered in filth with whom the viewer easily sympathized, facing abhorrent enemies, or worse, themselves; it can be argued that, perhaps unintentionally, his plots, motifs and characters bear a strong resemblance to those found in works of transgressive fiction. In two out of his three (O Skyllas & Hobby mou...) directed feature films, he co-starred with the Greek cult actor Kostas Stefanakis. Since his films were not released for the video market, they have always been difficult to track. His films were later released through the Greek video label Onar films.http://www.onarfilms.com/store/comersus_viewItem.asp?idProduct=19  His life  According to his close associate Tasos Aggelopoulos, he wasn't working; his income and funds for his films came from his wealthy family. As a folk musician, he played with bands in fairs around Greece. He never married, nor had children. This information, however, does not seem credible, as Dimitri Voyatzis' son, George Voyiatzis, appears on his film, \\"O Skyllas\\" and also on the title of his film company.  Lary-Skot productions  With Mr. Aggelopoulos, they founded the film company Lary-Skot productions (a.k.a. Larry Scott video production, a reference to the American bodybuilder Larry Scott) and through it produced and \\"released\\" his films. Other productions of Lary-Skot productions include the film O Fotografos kai ta manoulia tou (The photographer and his babes) and O Videoclubas (The Video rental Guy). Lary- Skot productions was located in Pagrati, in Athens, Greece. After his death, the company passed to Mr. Aggelopoulos, a wedding videographer at the time of the film productions and currently an electrician, who worked with Mr. Voyatzis as a cinematographer, a co-director, a gaffer and a boom operator. Mr. Aggelopoulos considers Voyatzis's films garbage and admits that he has lost any negatives and film copies of the Lary-Skot films.  A Dimitris Voyatzis renaissance  While it has been several years since Mr. Voyatzis's death, due to screenings in Greek cult film festivals, his films started reaching new audiences and have become more popular than ever.

Part 1 aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on August 19, 2005, and Part 2 aired on August 26, 2005. In the episode, Starbuck returns to the human fleet bearing the Arrow of Apollo. President Laura Roslin leads a team to the surface of Kobol to find the Tomb of Athena and a map to Earth.Whether the Earth of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica is a fictional portrayal of the real-life Earth, another planet sharing the name, or an in-universe myth is unknown to the audience at this point in the series. Commander William Adama overcomes his anger at Roslin and her allies and joins them on Kobol, where the Tomb provides a clue to Earth's location. The fleet is reunited. According to executive producer David Eick, who wrote Part 1 and co-wrote Part 2 with executive producer Ronald D. Moore, \\"Home\\" is more about character development and relationships than about story. The episode received favorable critical review. Plot In the previous episode, \\"The Farm\\", Adama returned to command following an assassination attempt by the Galactica copy of Boomer (Galactica-Boomer). Roslin led almost a third of the fleet back to Kobol to search for a way to Earth. Starbuck left Caprica with Helo and the Cylon known until then as the Caprica copy of Boomer (Sharon). Part 1 Roslin struggles to persuade the Quorum of Twelve of Apollo's loyalty. Tom Zarek suggests arming the civilian ships in case Galactica attacks, but Apollo says they would stand no chance against the battlestar. Priestess Elosha reminds everyone that the Scriptures predict that a return to Kobol would result in lives lost. Starbuck docks with Roslin's flagship. Before she can explain about Caprica-Sharon, Apollo sees her and puts a gun to Caprica-Sharon's head. Helo appears and draws his weapon on Apollo to defend Sharon. Roslin defuses the standoff by promising Sharon will not be harmed but then orders her thrown out the airlock. Roslin only relents when Sharon claims to know the location of the Tomb of Athena, where the Scriptures claim a path to Earth can be found. Roslin threatens to put Helo and Sharon, and thus their unborn child, out the airlock unless Sharon leads them to it. Privately, Zarek admits to his aide-de-camp, Meier, that he does not share Roslin's religious convictions. They plot to kill Apollo so Zarek can replace him at Roslin's side. On Kobol, Roslin leads a team that includes Apollo, Starbuck, Sharon, Helo, Zarek, Meier, Elosha, and several guards. Elosha is killed by a land mine. Cylon Centurions ambush the party, who fends them off with the help of Sharon; she grabs a stray grenade launcher and destroys one of the Centurions, to Apollo's surprise. On Galactica, Commander Adama assesses what resources remain after the defection of part of the fleet to \\"a religious fanatic and a terrorist\\", as he describes Roslin and Zarek. He appoints George Birch, an inexperienced but \\"honest and loyal\\" pilot, to replace Apollo commanding the Viper pilots; several accidents happen under Birch's leadership. Adama appears before the press; denounces those who followed Roslin, whom he describes as no longer President; and threatens to detain anyone who reports that he does not know where Earth is. Later, he confides in Anastasia \\"Dee\\" Dualla how hurt he is by betrayal. Dee replies that he has broken his promise to find the fleet a new home and suggests his hurt has more to do with his own feeling of helplessness than betrayal. Adama dismisses Dee brusquely but later asks for reconnaissance photos of Kobol, promising to reunite the fleet, \\"our family\\". Part 2 Head Six tells Gaius Baltar that their child will be born in the cell built for Galactica-Boomer. Baltar loses patience and starts mocking the idea that he could have a child with an imaginary woman. Six dons a casual appearance and tells Baltar that she is nothing more than a coping mechanism created by his subconscious following his participation in the genocide of humanity. She taunts him and encourages him to get a brain scan. Doctor Cottle finds nothing wrong and writes Baltar off as a hypochondriac. Sharon continues to guide the party on Kobol based on her knowledge of human theology. Apollo remains suspicious of Sharon and Helo, but Starbuck vouches for them. Sharon tells Helo she has many memories as Boomer aboard Galactica and that their child will be female. Meier suggests to Zarek that they frame Sharon for Apollo's murder, but Zarek insists they wait until they've found the Tomb. Commander Adama arrives on Kobol with Billy Keikeya and Chief Galen Tyrol. Roslin reconciles with Billy. Adama reconciles with Apollo and Starbuck. He attacks Sharon, recalling Galactica-Boomer's betrayal, but is prevented from killing her by chest pain following his surgery. Adama reconciles with Roslin, acknowledges her role in saving his and Apollo's life following the Cylon attack on the Colonies, and joins her quest for the Tomb. Tyrol approaches Sharon uncomfortably; Sharon tells him she \\"remembers\\" him and hugs him. Meier tells Sharon about the murder of Galactica-Boomer and warns her to start looking out for herself and her unborn baby. After Adama arrives, Zarek orders Meier to stop plotting, to no avail. Sharon tells Helo she plans to \\"take matters into my own hands.\\" Meier provides her a handgun, and she promises to ambush Commander Adama when they reach the Tomb. However, when the time comes, she shoots Meier instead, declares she has no hidden programming like Galactica-Boomer's, and surrenders the weapon to Adama. Adama orders Tyrol to guard Zarek, Sharon, and Helo and enters the Tomb with Roslin, Apollo, Starbuck, and Billy. Starbuck inserts the Arrow of Apollo into a statue of the archer Sagittaron, triggering a vision of a grassy field under a night sky. The party sees constellations representing each of the Twelve Colonies, and Starbuck realizes they are \\"standing\\" on Earth. Apollo recognizes a nebula among the constellations (he says it's the Lagoon Nebula, to which his father Adama says it's Astral Body M8) and concludes the fleet can plot its next direction based on it. Returning to Galactica, Adama promises to keep the fleet unified and reinstates Roslin as President. Sharon is placed in a cell built for Galactica-Boomer. Helo speaks to Sharon about their baby through a direct phone line. Eavesdropping, Baltar realizes the connection with Six's prediction for their \\"child\\". Having ruled out the possibility that Six is created by a chip in his brain, and now concluding from her foreknowledge of Sharon's pregnancy that she cannot just be his own creation, he asks what she is. She answers, \\"I'm an angel of God sent here to protect you, to guide you, to love you.\\" He asks, \\"To what end?\\" She replies, \\"To the end of the human race.\\" Deleted scenes In a scene deleted from Part 1, Elosha confesses to Roslin that she had lost her faith before the Cylon attack on the Colonies. Seeing the hope in Roslin as Elosha administered Roslin's oath of office restored her faith.Battlestar Galactica DVD, season 2.0, disc 2, \\"Home, Part 1\\" deleted scenes.

Characterization Eick says \\"Home\\" is more about character development and relationships than about story. Susan Tankersley of Television Without Pity agrees, comparing the episode to \\"a long family car trip.\\" Jason Davis of Mania notes that Apollo and Starbuck act like children with one another and connects their behavior to \\"their damaged social development\\". Eick said that actor Edward James Olmos (Commander Adama) helped him craft the encounter between Adama and Sharon by saying that he expected Adama would try to kill any Number Eight copy he met. Moore said Olmos \\"did your [Eick's] homework\\", and Eick agreed. Moore and Eick view Adama and Roslin's reconciliation scene as a different tone for the characters, who to this point had only shared, in Eick's words, \\"stiff pleasantries\\". By the end of the scene, they are calling each other by their first names, something the characters had not done before. Moore says that during \\"Home\\" Helo begins to develop \\"conflicted loyalties\\". Production \\"Home\\" was the first teleplay written by Eick. Director Sergio Mimica-Gezzan told him the episode was too long, so the production team petitioned the Sci Fi network to let them split it into two parts. Once the network signed off, the writers had very little time to craft enough material to fill both episodes. The split also allowed them to spend more time on Apollo and Starbuck's reunion and Adama and Roslin's reunion. In Eick's view, this was important because of the episode's emphasis on the characters. Part 1 The writers decided to have Elosha die in \\"Home\\" because they felt it was important that Roslin pay a personal price for leading the pilgrimage to Kobol. They considered having Billy die instead or as well, but ultimately they decided to kill only Elosha to symbolize the end of Roslin's journey to religious awakening. The writers also anticipated Roslin rebuilding her relationship with Adama and returning to political rather than religious leadership in later episodes, and Elosha represented changes in the opposite direction. In the script, Birch's mistakes rather than Dee's entreaty were the cause for Adama to change his mind and travel to Kobol. The scene between Adama and Dee and the scene with Birch's biggest mistake were swapped during editing. An artifact of this change is that Adama enters the CIC for the Birch mistake scene followed by Dee. When Starbuck first appears on Roslin's ship, Apollo kisses her. This was actor Jamie Bamber (Apollo)'s idea. Bamber and actress Katee Sackhoff ad-libbed some of Apollo and Starbuck's dialogue in \\"Home\\". The mechanics of the land mine that kills Elosha were inspired by the S-mines deployed by Nazi Germany during World War II. The shot of the mine bounding into the air was filmed conventionally, without visual effects. Part 2 Shooting for Part 2 proceeded slowly because of the large number of exterior shots and the size of the cast in those shots. The writers compensated by putting the actors in pairs or small groups where possible so the director would only need a few of them at a time. Nonetheless, Eick called \\"Home, Part 2\\" the most difficult episode in the series up to that point to produce, with the possible exception of the first-season finale, \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\". Executive producer Ronald D. Moore compared the teaser of Part 2, which intercuts between Roslin's party following scriptural clues to find the Tomb and Adama using scriptural clues to guess Roslin's location, to the teaser of \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming, Part 1\\", which also features intercuts. The writers had considered having Head Six tell Baltar he's crazy during the first season but never managed to fit it into any of that season's episodes. Splitting \\"Home\\" into two episodes created the space they needed to incorporate the idea into the episode. They considered having Baltar visit Sharon in her cell and replacing Six with a vision of Sharon in this episode. Adama and Billy's skin ripples as their Raptor enters the Kobol atmosphere. Eick had seen the effect in the film Moonraker and wanted it in the episode. The effect was achieved with an air blaster, the same way as in Moonraker, despite some danger for the actors. The party enters the Tomb cave by pushing a boulder out of the way, but only after Starbuck tries and fails to open the cave by waving the Arrow of Apollo around. Eick felt that the finished episode did not convey Starbuck's initial disappointment after having gone through so much to bring the Arrow from Caprica. The writers went through several versions of what the party would learn in the Tomb. First they thought that the Arrow itself could be a map to Earth, but they dismissed that because it didn't mandate a journey to Kobol. Then they considered having the party's investigation interrupted by a Cylon attack that would prevent them from learning Earth's exact location; this was abandoned because it seemed unnecessary and because the visual effects would have been too expensive. Reception Critical reception to \\"Home\\" was favorable. Tankersley gave Part 1 an A- and Part 2 a B. Davis gave Part 1 an A- and part 2 an A, calling Sharon's betrayal of Meier in favor of Adama \\"one of the best executed pieces of writing seen on television in years.\\" Simon Brew of Den of Geek was less enthusiastic, criticizing the episode's pace but nonetheless calling it \\"some smashing viewing.\\" Connections to other series elements *Moore and Eick said that \\"Home\\" resolves much of the conflict that began in \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\". In this sense they considered it the true end of the first season. *In the third-season episode \\"Torn\\", Head Six reaffirms her self-description as an angel sent to protect Baltar. *In \\"The Farm\\", Starbuck promised Sam Anders she would return to Caprica and rescue him. In \\"Home\\", she encourages Roslin to plan a rescue mission to Caprica. *In the original series episode \\"Lost Planet of the Gods\\", Commander Adama discovers Kobol and tries to decipher ancient clues to finding Earth. Film homages Starbuck playing with her Pyramid ball is an homage to Steve McQueen's character in The Great Escape. The shot of Six sitting naked on a backward chair is an homage to Scandal. The scene in which the Galactica crew applauds Roslin is an homage to Brubaker. Astronomy The constellations Roslin identifies in the Tomb correspond to the real-life Zodiacal constellations. Moore and Eick concede that all twelve of these constellations cannot be viewed simultaneously in the night sky but say it would be disorienting for the audience to rotate the sky throughout the scene in a way that would make the representation faithful. They also concede that the constellations shown in the episode do not resemble the real-life constellations. Apollo identifies the nebula as the Lagoon Nebula, in the constellation Scorpio. His father refers to it as \\"Astral Body M8.\\"\\"Home, Part 2\\". The real-life Lagoon Nebula has Messier designation M8 but is located in Sagittarius, not Scorpius.

It aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on September 9, 2005. In the episode, journalist D'Anna Biers tapes a report on life aboard Galactica and uncovers a plot against Colonel Saul Tigh. She discovers the pregnant Number Eight copy (Sharon) being held secretly aboard the ship, but Commander William Adama forbids her to include it in her final report. However, Biers is a Cylon, and she shares the footage of Sharon with her Cylon brethren. \\"Final Cut\\" received mixed critical reception. Plot In \\"Resistance\\", Tigh ordered supplies taken by force from civilian ships. On the civilian ship Gideon, Marines commanded by Lieutenant Joe Palladino opened fire on a hostile but unarmed crowd of civilians, killing four. Biers is preparing a report on what she calls the \\"Gideon massacre.\\" Hoping to influence Biers to produce a more \\"balanced\\" report, Adama grants her unrestricted access to document life aboard Galactica. Biers conducts frank interviews with crew members and captures some pilots' hijinks on camera. After Kat overdoses on stimulants and botches a landing, Biers follows her to Galacticas sickbay. There, she discovers Doctor Cottle treating Sharon for a complication with her pregnancy. Adama confiscates the footage, but Biers secretly keeps a copy. She then records the crew during a successful defense against incoming Cylon Raiders and uncovers a disgruntled Palladino as the perpetrator of death threats and an assassination attempt on Tigh. In her final report, Biers describes arriving on Galactica with a bias against the crew but changing her mind. Pleased with the report, Adama recommends it be shown throughout the fleet. On Caprica, several Cylons also watch the report, as well as the secret footage of Sharon. Its then revealed that Biers herself is a Cylon as another copy sits with the other Cylons. The Raider attack was so that the footage could be transmitted to the Cylons. Biers confirms that both Sharon and her child survived and calls the child \\"a miracle from God.\\" Deleted scene In a scene deleted from the final episode, President Laura Roslin is shown coming up with the idea of inviting Biers to Galactica. She is motivated by the upcoming presidential election and demands from the Quorum of Twelve for an investigation of the Gideon incident. Analysis Jason Davis of Mania said the episode contrasts \\"the essential conservatism of the military... with the naturally liberal notions of the media.\\" He also singles out Helo's observation during his interview with Biers that combat training seeks to make soldiers less human. Davis views this as part of an argument by the series's writers that humans and Cylons are similar. Lynnette R. Porter, David Lavery, and Hillary Robson agree that this \\"goes to the core of the series' major themes\\". Susan A. George views Adama's request for a report that shows the positive and negative sides of his crew as parallel to the series's nuanced depiction of humanity. Production=Writing The writers had been considering writing an episode focusing on a journalist aboard Galactica since the first season. Director Robert M. Young, who directed the first- season episode \\"Six Degrees of Separation\\", was brought back to direct \\"Final Cut\\" because of his experience as a documentarian. Executive producer David Eick had worked with actress Lucy Lawless (Biers) on the series Xena: Warrior Princess and tried to find a role for her in the first season. Lawless declined due to other commitments but agreed when offered the role in \\"Final Cut\\". Executive producer Ronald D. Moore cites journalist Christiane Amanpour as a model for Biers's character. Biers's monologue at the end of her report, in which she acknowledges the crew's imperfections but lauds their heroism and resilience, reflects Moore's own \\"thesis of the show.\\" In the episode, Biers interviews a number of secondary characters, including Anastasia \\"Dee\\" Dualla, Racetrack, and Lieutenant Felix Gaeta. Moore encouraged the actors playing these characters (in these cases, Kandyse McClure, Leah Cairns, and Alessandro Juliani, respectively) to improvise their interviews extensively and teach him \\"things I didn't know about these people that I created.\\" This is also the first time Dualla and Gaeta's first names are presented to the audience. Moore considers the episode to be mainly a character piece about Galacticas crew. He said that the subplot focusing on Palladino's threats against Tigh serves only to inject what he considered was a baseline level of tension required in a television episode and admitted that he was never satisfied with it. The first draft had Palladino shooting himself at the end of his confrontation with Tigh, but the writers considered this \\"gratuitous\\" and rewrote it to have Marines arrest him instead. Filming According to Moore, the decision not to include any exterior shots during the battle with the Raiders was a creative choice. Showing the reactions in the CIC and hangar deck to the pilots' audio transmissions was, in his view, truer to the episode's documentary style. Flick Harrison, the actor who plays Biers's cameraman, is a cameraman in real life. His camera is also real, and he shot some of the footage in \\"Final Cut\\" with it. Music At the end of Biers's report, a part of the \\"Colonial Anthem\\" from the original Battlestar Galactica plays over images of Galactica crew members.Minute 41:35. Composer Bear McCreary collaborated with Stu Phillips, who wrote \\"Colonial Anthem\\", to produce the track. McCreary called the collaboration \\"one of the highlights of the second season.\\" Reception \\"Final Cut\\" received mixed critical reception. Davis gave the episode an A-, praising Lawless's performance in particular. Simon Brew appreciated the surprise reveal of Biers as a Cylon but criticized numerous other elements of the episode. Susan Tankersley of Television Without Pity gave \\"Final Cut\\" a C, saying that Moore's premise that the characters are \\"flawed but heroic\\" had been evident from the beginning of the series and did not require a dedicated episode.

The church of the Benedictine Abbey de Sainte-Croix de Bouzonville serves today as the parish church. In the thirteenth century the dukes of Lorraine established a court of justice here, which increased the life of the town, which depended on the abbey, which was rebuilt on its eleventh-century foundations. The Abbey of Bouzonville remained very much in the gift of the dukes of Lorraine, who were in the habit of bestowing the post of abbot in commendam on their relations to the end of the seventeenth century.In 1699 the theologian and historian Matthieu Petit-Didier was canonically elected Abbot of Bouzonville, but could not take possession because the Duke of Lorraine had given the abbey in commendam to his brother. (Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"Matthieu Petit-Didier\\"). The town suffered so severely during the Thirty Years War that at the end of the seventeenth century Bouzonville numbered few more than two dozen hearths. An h√¥tel de ville, built in 1719 and enlarged in 1763 was symptomatic of the town's revival, as was a Jewish community, noted in 1726. The abbey was suppressed at the Revolution, the monks dispersed and the library sold. Tanneries and spinning mills developed the town's economy in the nineteenth century. The convent's buildings were restored sufficiently in 1893 to shelter a hospice. The First World War spared Bouzonville, but heavy fighting in the Second World War destroyed the bridge and 139 houses. More recently, Bouzonville has undergone a drain of its labour forces to German industry in Saar.Documented in Les frontaliers mosellans travaillant en Sarre 1966.

It aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on September 16, 2005. In the episode, the Number Eight copy being held on Galactica (Sharon) helps delete a computer virus created by the Cylons, and Chief Galen Tyrol builds a stealth fighter from spare parts. Critics reviewed \\"Flight of the Phoenix\\" favorably. Plot In \\"Valley of Darkness,\\" a computer virus created by the Cylons shut down Galacticas power, but Lieutenant Felix Gaeta seemingly purged it. In \\"The Farm,\\" Commander William Adama sentenced Specialist Cally to 30 days in Galacticas brig for killing the Number Eight copy (Boomer) who shot Adama. Gaeta determines that the Cylon virus is still active, is responsible for a series of malfunctions aboard Galactica, and threatens to take full control of the ship. Adama enlists Sharon's help. She confirms Gaeta's diagnosis and warns that a Cylon attack is imminent. Hundreds of Cylon Raiders and Heavy Raiders appear and hold formation, preparing to activate the virus. Forced to trust Sharon, Adama allows her to interface directly with Galacticas systems by inserting a fiber optic cable into her hand. Sharon helps delete the virus and broadcasts a virus of her own to the Cylon ships, rendering them helpless and easy pickings for the Vipers. Sharon is summarily returned to her cell. Helo is ostracized by his crewmates for his relationship with Sharon. Haunted by memories of Boomer, Tyrol does not join the celebration of Cally's release. Tyrol and Helo argue about their respective relationships with Number Eight; the argument comes to blows. Inspired by Lee \\"Apollo\\" Adama's comment that \\"no one's expecting any miracles,\\" Tyrol begins to build a new starfighter from salvaged parts. Despite initial skepticism, crew members from throughout the ship join the project. At Helo's suggestion, Tyrol uses carbon composites for the exterior, making it stealth capable. The completed fighter, known as the Blackbird, makes a successful maiden flight with Starbuck as test pilot. At the Blackbird's dedication ceremony, President Laura Roslin, who has just learned she has weeks to live, praises the fighter's construction as \\"an act of faith.\\" Tyrol reveals that the fighter is named Laura in her honor. Helo reconciles with his crewmates, and Tyrol visits Sharon in her cell. Characterization In his podcast commentary on \\"Flight of the Phoenix,\\" executive producer Ronald D. Moore discussed his views of what the episode's events reveal about several of the characters. *Adama is a father figure who is trying to get his family, the crew of Galactica, to safety. *Tyrol and Helo both harbor \\"a lot of rage... frustration... self-hatred and ambiguity\\" because of how they love Cylons. Each of them sees himself in the other, and this is why they fight. *Tyrol begins the episode by disassembling an unserviceable Viper and brawling. He then turns that energy to build the Blackbird and ultimately \\"face[s] his demon\\" by talking to Sharon. *The scene in which Apollo's sparring with Dee is interrupted by Billy Keikeya is intended to suggest a love triangle among the three. Jen Segrest of TV Squad speculates that Sharon only helps the humans to protect her unborn child. Analysis In Moore's view, Sharon inserting a cable into her arm and taking control of Galactica illustrates a difference in the Battlestar Galactica universe between humans and Cylons. Though Cylons choose to appear human out of respect for the form they believe to have been created by God, they are essentially mechanical beings. Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity expands on the human-machine dichotomy: Moore compares the Vipers' destruction of the Cylon ships to the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot in World War II. Production The writers considered showing spreading the construction of the Blackbird over several episodes as a running subplot. Moore admitted that, realistically, building a starfighter would likely take weeks. However, they decided to tell the whole story in one episode as part of the theme of the fleet's morale, introduced by a comment from Commander Adama early in \\"Flight of the Phoenix\\". They also considered it unrealistic that Tyrol would be able to build a Viper, so they came up with another craft, the Blackbird stealth fighter. Moore came up with the plot device of Sharon infecting the incoming Cylon ships because he wanted to try something other than an ordinary space battle. The specific mechanic of her inserting a cable into her arm began as a joke in the writers' room. Early drafts went into detail about the consequences of wiping Galacticas computers, as Gaeta does following Sharon's instruction. This was to be not just navigational software but also all records of Colonial civilization. The idea was abandoned as too geeky to impart an emotional impact on the audience.Eick, David, and Moore, Ronald D. Commentary for \\"Pegasus\\" extended edition. Battlestar Galactica DVD, season 2.5, disc 1. During the test flight, Starbuck and the Blackbird disappear briefly. Moore decided to elongate her absence after seeing footage of actor Aaron Douglas playing Tyrol nervously awaiting Starbuck's return. The test flight came after the dedication in the script, but they were switched in editing because the dedication was seen as the episode's \\"emotional climax\\". Tyrol and Sharon were scripted to exchange a few lines of dialogue during Tyrol's visit at the end of the episode, but director Michael Nankin and film editor Jacques Gravett cut them. Moore approved of the change, saying, \\"it doesn't really matter what they say to each other\\". One version of the dialogue is included as a deleted scene on the DVD version of the episode.Battlestar Galactica DVD, season 2.0, disc 3, \\"Flight of the Phoenix\\" deleted scenes. One of the system malfunctions shown on Galactica in \\"Flight of the Phoenix\\" is the ship's firing range losing oxygen as Apollo, Starbuck, and Hot Dog practice shooting. According to Moore, the scene was scripted to give the audience a slowly building sense of discomfort. The three characters' differing reactions are based on observations of pilots under induced hypoxia. They save themselves by shooting out the range's window. Actors Jamie Bamber (Apollo) and Katee Sackhoff (Starbuck) came up with the idea that their characters should aim the weapon together. Reception Critics reviewed \\"Flight of the Phoenix\\" favorably. Clifton gave it an A- and was particularly moved by the dedication scene. Simon Brew of Den of Geek called this scene \\"touching\\". Segrest reviewed the episode favorably, reacting emotionally to Tyrol's struggle to build the Blackbird. Amanda Keith of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group acknowledged several flaws in the plotting but said, nonetheless, \\"I love this episode.\\" Kelly Woo of TV Squad ranked \\"Flight of the Phoenix\\" as the 10th best episode of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica. John Kubicek of BuddyTV ranked it 21st best and called the episode \\"inspirational\\". Alan Sepinwall listed it among his favorite episodes of the series.

It aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on September 23, 2005. Following \\"Pegasus\\", the series went on hiatus until January 2006. In the episode, the human fleet encounters the Battlestar Pegasus, commanded by Admiral Helena Cain. She assumes command of the fleet. Gaius Baltar discovers that Pegasus crew members have been raping and torturing a Cylon prisoner. Cain sentences Helo and Chief Galen Tyrol to death after they accidentally kill a Pegasus officer who was preparing to rape Sharon. In response, Commander William Adama orders Vipers to escort Marines to Pegasus.

Plot A large unknown ship appears on Galacticas DRADIS. After a tense moment, the ship is identified as the Battlestar Pegasus, a Colonial vessel previously believed destroyed in the Cylon attack on the Colonies. Cain boards Galactica with an armed escort and welcomes the crew \\"back to the Colonial Fleet.\\" Cain relates to Adama and President Laura Roslin how she ordered a risky maneuver to escape the initial Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies. Adama recognizes Cain as his superior, but Cain promises not to interfere with Galacticas internal affairs. Cain declines to resupply the fleet's civilian ships and integrates the battlestars' crews, transferring Apollo and Starbuck to Pegasus over Commander Adama's objections. Cain's executive officer, Colonel Jack Fisk, tells Colonel Saul Tigh how Cain shot his predecessor for refusing an order. Fisk claims his story is a joke, but Tigh believes it is true and relates the story to Adama. Adama reiterates his willingness to follow Cain, to both Roslin and Tigh, and insists that Apollo and Starbuck obey their transfer orders. Baltar visits Gina,She is not named in the episode; executive producer Ronald D. Moore gave the name in his podcast commentary on \\"Pegasus\\". a Number Six copy held prisoner aboard Pegasus. He and Head Six are horrified to discover that the Pegasus crew has systematically tortured and raped Gina. Baltar attempts to establish a rapport with Gina by providing food and confessing to his involvement with another Six copy on Caprica. Helo and Tyrol rescue Sharon from imminent rape by a Pegasus interrogator but accidentally kill the interrogator in the process. Cain denies Adama's request that Helo and Tyrol be given a jury court-martial and sentences them both to death for murder and treason. Adama demands that Cain return them to Galactica and orders Vipers to escort a Marine assault team to Pegasus. Cain refuses and sends the Pegasus Vipers to intercept Galacticas. Extended version Director Michael Rymer's cut of \\"Pegasus\\" was about 20 minutes too long for broadcast in an hour-long time slot. Executive producers David Eick and Ronald D. Moore advocated for \\"Pegasus\\" to be shown as a 90-minute special episode. The Sci Fi Network refused, so Eick and Moore cut it down to about 44 minutes.Eick, David, and Moore, Ronald D.

Notable plot differences with the broadcast version are listed below, in the order in which they appear in the episode. *Starbuck argues unsuccessfully to Adama and Roslin that Galactica should return to Caprica to rescue survivors. She promised to rescue Sam Anders from Caprica in a previous episode, \\"The Farm\\". *Cain and Baltar discuss the efficacy of physical coercion in interrogation during a visit to Sharon's cell. *A conversation between Cain and Adama makes clear that Pegasus is much larger, more advanced, and more powerful than Galactica. *Helo and Tyrol interrupt rather than prevent Sharon's rape. Several shots without dialogue are inserted or lengthened, as well. Analysis Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity, Jason Davis of Mania, and Jen Segrest of TV Squad each compare the Galactica crew to the Pegasus crew. Because they have chosen to guard a vast civilian fleet, the Galactica has lost some discipline but maintained its humanity. The Pegasus crew has lost some of its humanity, as demonstrated by their brutal treatment of their Cylon prisoner. Clifton compares the Pegasus crew to the barbaric Reavers from the television series Firefly. Gina (Tricia Helfer). Scholars have considered the use of torture depicted in \\"Pegasus\\". John Ip considers the depiction of torture in \\"Pegasus\\". He contrasts the Galactica crew's relatively generous treatment of Sharon with the Pegasus crew's treatment of Gina and Starbuck's treatment of Leoben Conoy in the first-season episode \\"Flesh and Bone\\". Noting that Sharon has provided the humans with useful intelligence, where Gina and Leoben have not, Ip characterizes \\"Pegasus\\" as \\"an allegorical critique of the [George W.] Bush Administration‚Äôs treatment of terrorist detainees.\\" Ip also sees parallels between the way the Pegasus crew talks about the captive Cylons as subhuman and Bush administration rhetoric surrounding such detainees. Roz Kaveney considers the humans' simultaneous insistence on the inhumanity of the Cylons and use of torture and rape against them \\"paradoxical\\". Overall, Ip contrasts what he considers a \\"skeptical\\" portrayal of the effectiveness of torture as an interrogation method in \\"Pegasus\\" with what he views as a more sympathetic treatment in the television series 24. Tung Yin also invokes 24, calling the Pegasus interrogator a more realistic \\"professional torturer\\" than Jack Bauer, the 24 protagonist. Clifton notes that the Pegasus crew who celebrate raping Gina and look forward to raping Sharon are all men, and the female Galactica crew react negatively. He questions whether Cally is truly concerned about Sharon, recalling Cally's sexual assault in the first-season episode \\"Bastille Day\\". Clifton further suggests a homoerotic element to the men's enthusiasm and compares the situation to a frat party. Amanda Keith of Los Angeles Newspaper Group's Film Cannon considers Cain's verdict against Helo and Tyrol. Keith notes Cain is in the right legally: Helo and Tyrol broke their oaths as members of the Colonial Fleet. However, Keith argues that Cain has a moral responsibility to spare them to preserve what human life still remains. Clifton argues that Cain's decision is correct and that the audience's prejudices in favor of the two men do not apply to her character because she does not know them. Davis compares Adama's defiance of Cain to Apollo's mutiny in \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\". Eick notes a practice of actor Edward James Olmos (Adama) going back to his role in Miami Vice: his character avoids eye contact with other characters he doesn't respect. Eick says the amount Adama looks at Cain in \\"Pegasus\\" indicates that he respects her. According to Clifton, the ways in which Apollo and Starbuck protest their transfer orders reflect their characters: Apollo points out the detrimental effects of shuffling personnel ahead of an operation, and Starbuck insults Cain and the Pegasus CAG. Production In January 2005, Moore wrote that the writers had been discussing \\"for a couple of years\\" a storyline around a battlestar Pegasus inspired by the original Battlestar Galactica. In his September 2005 podcast commentary on the episode, Moore said he had been thinking about the episode \\"literally since I agreed to do the project.\\" However, he waited until the middle of the second season so the series would be further developed when Pegasus and Cain appear. In particular, he wanted the audience to have built some loyalty for the Galactica characters to complicate their reaction to Cain's (correct, in Moore's view) assessment that Galactica runs problematically. Moore abandoned several elements of the original-series episode involving Cain, \\"The Living Legend\\"; the main similarities in his view are Cain appearing suddenly in the Pegasus and being \\"more of a hardass character than Commander Adama.\\" Moore considers the key differences to be Cain's gender and her authority over Adama. \\"Pegasus\\" was the first episode of Battlestar Galactica written by Anne Cofell Saunders, whom Eick and Moore hired based on her work writing an episode for the fourth season of 24. Several actresses were considered for the role of Cain. Moore had worked with Forbes previously when she played Ro Laren on Star Trek: The Next Generation. Other members of the production team knew her from her work in film. Moore was excited by what he described as the \\"challenge\\" of writing Cain as a younger character and was ultimately very pleased by the choice to cast Forbes. According to Eick, Forbes was reluctant at first to accept the part because she felt her role as Ro had resulted in her being typecast as a science fiction actress. Eick and Moore advocated for Sharon's rape as shown in the extended version to be included in the broadcast version. According to Eick and Moore, the Sci Fi Network did not permit it, citing substantial differences between the script and what was filmed and the belief that the material would be too controversial for television. Gina's name is not mentioned within the episode. The name is a reference to fans of the original series who called the re-imagined series GINO for \\"Galactica in Name Only\\". Cain's practice of forcing her staff to stand at meetings was inspired by a similar practice of John Bolton Moore read about in a newspaper. The Pegasus set is distinct from the Galactica set, but it was built on the same soundstage. Financial and physical constraints meant they had to reuse pieces; all the scenes in the episode in corridors on Pegasus were filmed in the same corridor lit differently and shot at different angles to suggest different parts of the ship. Moore compares the difference between Galactica and Pegasus to the difference between a historical aircraft carrier like the USS Hornet and a modern aircraft carrier. \\"Pegasus\\" features more shots with harsh lighting and with cameras on dollies rather than handheld than in prior episodes. According to Eick, Rymer thought such changes would make \\"Pegasus\\" less in the style of a documentary and more appropriate to the larger scale of the narrative. Eick also suggests Rymer was bored with the series's style and wanted to try new approaches. Eick and Moore characterized composer Bear McCreary's score for the teaser as lulling the audience into a state of comfort. Reception \\"Pegasus\\" was nominated for the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. It lost to the Doctor Who episodes \\"The Empty Child\\" and \\"The Doctor Dances\\". Actress Tricia Helfer, who played Six, received the 2006 Leo Award for \\"Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series\\" for her performance in the episode. Critics praised Michelle Forbes's performance as Admiral Cain. Critical reception of \\"Pegasus\\" was favorable. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune wrote, \\"Tricia Helfer and Grace Park [Sharon] gave outstanding performances\\". Clifton gave \\"Pegasus\\" an A, praising the performances of Mary McDonnell (Roslin), Helfer, and especially Forbes and calling the episode as a whole \\"really, really well done, and really, really hard to watch.\\" Segrest also said it was hard to watch but nonetheless reviewed the episode favorably, commending the performances of James Callis (Baltar) and Helfer as Gina. Davis gave \\"Pegasus\\" an A+, praising Forbes, Helfer, McDonnell, and Olmos and calling the episode's musical score \\"without equal\\". Keith called \\"Pegasus\\" \\"the darkest the show has gone\\" but said both the aired and extended versions were \\"A+ episodes.\\" Simon Brew of Den of Geek called the episode \\"flat-out outstanding.\\" Michael Hickerson of Slice of SciFi ranked \\"Pegasus\\" as the eighth best episode of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, calling it \\"compelling and... fascinating\\". John Kubicek of BuddyTV ranked it ninth best, saying the ending \\"could be one of TV's greatest cliffhangers.\\" Kelly Woo of TV Squad also ranked it ninth best. Alan Sepinwall listed it among his favorite episodes of the series, calling the episode \\"a gut-wrencher from start to finish\\" and Forbes \\"perfect\\". Jackson Alpern of Maxim ranked the first scene of confusion over whether Pegasus is a Cylon ship the ninth best moment in the series. Eric Goldman of IGN ranked \\"Admiral Cain's reign\\" in \\"Pegasus\\" and the following (two-part) episode, \\"Resurrection Ship\\", second on his list of the series's top \\"storylines and moments\\", praising Forbes's performance and calling the three episodes \\"riveting\\". In separate interviews, Olmos, McDonnell, and actor Aaron Douglas (Tyrol) were asked to respond to criticism of the graphic nature of the rape scene. Olmos said of people who were upset, \\"They should be warned right now: please turn off your television sets and do not watch this show because it‚Äôs only going to provide more insight into the complexities of what happens to human beings.\\" McDonnell said that the scene was helpful for promoting dialogue and contrasted it with how violence against women is portrayed elsewhere in media. Douglas insisted that the scene was not sensationalistic but rather was an attempt to honestly portray the human condition. Connection to other series elements In \\"Resurrection Ship\\", it is revealed that Pegasus raided several civilian ships for supplies and abandoned them to the Cylons. Some members of the Pegasus crew, including the deck chief, were conscripted from these ships. Also in \\"Resurrection Ship\\", two of the Pegasus crew members who brag in \\"Pegasus\\" about raping Gina subject the captive Helo and Tyrol to a blanket party. Some of Battlestar Pegasuss backstory is presented in the television movie Battlestar Galactica: Razor: *Cain and Gina were lovers until the Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies. *Cain executed her previous executive officer exactly as Fisk described. *The raids on the civilian ships are shown.

Some 40 years after their successful infiltration, some of the perpetrators decided to go public. In 2014, Betty Medsger's book The Burglary: The Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret F.B.I. was released, which contains the burglars' description of the burglary and revealed the identities of five of the eight burglars. Filmmaker Johanna Hamilton also made a documentary titled 1971 (2014).  Members  On March 11, 1976, the FBI closed their investigation of the group's burglary without conclusively identifying any of the perpetrators. The members' identities remained a secret until early 2014, when seven of the eight who could be found agreed to be interviewed by journalist Betty Medsger, who was writing a nonfiction book on the event: The Burglary. Of these seven, five agreed to be publicly identified: Keith Forsyth, Bonnie Raines, John C. Raines (who 10 years prior to the burglary was a member of the Freedom Riders), and Robert Williamson; the recruiter and informal leader, William C. Davidon, died in 2013 before the book was published but had planned to reveal his involvement, as well. The other two burglars who were interviewed for the hardcover edition chose to be identified by the pseudonyms \\"Susan Smith\\" and \\"Ron Durst\\". The final burglar, Judi Feingold, had, unlike the others, fled across the country in 1971 and could not be found for 43 years. When she discovered that the other burglars were breaking their silence, she contacted Robert Williamson and eventually was interviewed by Medsger as well, which was included in the epilogue to the paperback edition of The Burglary. Several months after the burglary, Forsyth and Williamson were also members of The Camden 28, a separate activist group which broke into a draft board to destroy documents, in order to impede the war draft and make an anti-war statement. Burglary Delaware County Courthouse in Media, Pennsylvania The burglars did extensive surveillance of the FBI office, to ensure they knew when the office was empty. The break-in was perpetrated on the day of Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali's Fight of the Century, in the hope that any security guards would be glued to their radios; Ali was himself a COINTELPRO target due to his involvement with the Nation of Islam and the anti-war movement. The picture of the office shown in The New York Times video corresponds to 1 Veterans Sq, Media, PA. Statement In a 2014 interview, John Raines said that while returning from the burglary early in the morning, the group had stopped at a pay phone, called a Reuters journalist, and delivered the following statement: > On the night of March 8, 1971, the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the > FBI removed files from the Media, Pennsylvania, office of the FBI.

Investigation The FBI had up to 200 agents working on this case, but it was never solved, and the investigation was closed when the five-year statute of limitations ran out. Documentary films A documentary film titled 1971 was produced by Big Mouth Productions and co-produced by Laura Poitras. It had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 18, 2014. Asher Smart released the short live-action film, The Media Heist, in 2018.

Part 1 aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on January 6, 2006, and Part 2 aired on January 13, 2006. It was the first episode broadcast after a hiatus following the broadcast of the previous episode, \\"Pegasus\\", on September 23, 2005. In the episode, Admiral Helena Cain and Commander William Adama call a truce but plan to assassinate each other. The humans destroy a Cylon fleet that includes a resurrection ship. Cain and Adama both cancel their plots, but GinaThe character is not given a name in the episode; executive producer Ronald D. Moore first used the name in his podcast commentary on \\"Pegasus\\". escapes from the Pegasus brig and kills Cain. \\"Resurrection Ship\\" received positive critical reviews. Plot In \\"The Farm\\", Starbuck promised Sam Anders she would return to Caprica to rescue him. In \\"Pegasus\\", Apollo and Starbuck plotted to steal the stealth-capable Blackbird to obtain reconnaissance photos of a mysterious ship escorted by a large Cylon fleet. Cain sentenced Helo and Chief Galen Tyrol to death for accidentally killing an officer to rescue Sharon. Adama ordered Galactica's Vipers launched toward Pegasus, and Cain ordered the Pegasus Vipers to intercept them. Part 1 Both Viper groups seek permission to fire, but neither Cain nor Adama grants it. The standoff is interrupted by Starbuck, who returns in the Blackbird with photos of the Cylon vessel. Cain and Adama call off their attacks and agree to meet on Colonial One as neutral ground. President Laura Roslin mediates an uneasy truce: the resolution of Helo and Tyrol's fate will be delayed until after the attack on the Cylon fleet. Later, Roslin warns Adama privately that Cain will strike against Adama again and urges him to assassinate Cain first. Adama demurs. Impressed by what she calls Starbuck's \\"guts and initiative\\", Cain promotes her to Captain and appoints her Pegasus CAG. Starbuck persuades Cain to reinstate Apollo's flight status though she demotes Apollo to Lieutenant and relegates him to delivery runs. Cain also promises Starbuck she will lead the fleet back to Caprica, destroy the Cylons, and rescue the survivors. Doctor Cottle says Sharon will be all right. Adama apologizes to Sharon and orders her returned to her cell. In Gina's cell, Cain abuses the Cylon prisoner. Gina begs Gaius Baltar to kill her. She tells him that the Cylon vessel is a \\"resurrection ship\\", where Cylons are downloaded into new bodies; if it is destroyed Gina can die permanently. Cain resolves to destroy the ship, believing mortality will deter the Cylon pursuit. Colonel Jack Fisk tells Colonel Saul Tigh that Pegasus encountered a small civilian fleet. Cain ordered it stripped for parts, impressed some civilian personnel, executed the families of any who resisted, and abandoned the rest in space. Realizing that Roslin is right about Cain, Adama orders Starbuck to assassinate Cain once the attack on the Cylon fleet concludes. Likewise, Cain directs Fisk to take a detachment of Marines to Galactica to kill Adama after the attack. Part 2 Two Pegasus crewmen confront Helo and Tyrol in the Pegasus brig and beat them with soap bars wrapped in towels; Fisk discovers the blanket party and ends it. Cain warns Starbuck not to let her conscience dictate how she behaves at difficult moments. Apollo agrees to help Starbuck with the assassination but expresses discomfort to his father. Adama invites Sharon to his quarters and asks why the Cylons hate humans; she replies that the Cylons don't hate humans but think them unworthy of life because of their tendency toward murder. As the battle nears, Starbuck and Fisk wish each other \\"good hunting\\". The battle begins. Piloting the Blackbird, Apollo destroys the FTL drive on the resurrection ship, preventing it from escaping but is forced to eject after a damaged Colonial Raptor collides with the Blackbird. His spacesuit leaks oxygen and Apollo hallucinates before eventually allowing himself to suffocate. However, a search and rescue Raptor piloted by Racetrack locates Apollo and is able to revive him. The humans destroy the resurrection ship and the two Basestars guarding it. Cain and Adama contact Fisk and Starbuck respectively, but neither gives the order to assassinate. Both relieved, Fisk and Starbuck stand down. Baltar signals his rejection of Head Six in favor of Gina by repeating to Gina a coquettish speech Head Six gave earlier. Baltar distracts the Marine guard so that Gina can kill him and take his side arm. Gina asks Baltar to kill her, but he urges her to seek justice, not death, and promises to hide her. Cain returns to her quarters following the battle to find Gina lying in wait for her. Gina shoots Cain and disappears. Fisk and Starbuck eulogize Cain at her funeral. Fisk becomes Commander of Pegasus. Apollo confesses to Starbuck that he wanted to die in space. Helo and Tyrol return to Galactica. Helo and Sharon are reunited as Tyrol looks on. Recognizing that Adama now commands two battlestars, Roslin promotes him to Admiral. Adama helps the ailing Roslin to her feet and kisses her. Characterization In his podcast commentaries on \\"Resurrection Ship\\", executive producer Ronald D. Moore discussed his views of what the episode's events reveal about several of the characters. *Cain's decision not to kill Adama demonstrates that she is \\"human and... not a black-hatted villain.\\" *Baltar telling Head Six that he is bored of his fantasy house reflects his growing preference for Gina. *Though Baltar has real feelings for Gina, his speech to her is \\"based on a lie, which is at the heart of a lot of things that Baltar‚Äôs about.\\" *Apollo's experience with hypoxia affects his character strongly and influences him for the rest of the second season. *Adama's initial reaction to Roslin's assassination proposal reflects a reversal of what Moore considers the expected roles of a hawkish Adama and a dovish Roslin. *Adama's promotion is a sort of parting gift from Roslin, as she expects she will die soon. In his reviews of \\"Resurrection Ship\\", Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity discussed his own views on the characters. *Cain's actions in \\"Resurrection Ship\\" provide context for her actions in \\"Pegasus\\" and make her character \\"not sympathetic, but understandable\\" in the mold of Colonel Kurtz. However, the contrast between Cain's decision to pillage her civilian fleet and Adama's decision to protect his reflects \\"an issue of character rather than humanizing circumstance\\" (emphasis Clifton's). *Gina's ability to free Baltar from Head Six represents an opportunity to redeem him; Clifton compares Baltar and Gina's relationship with Angel and Darla's in the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. *Gina's desire to die represents a profound break from the Cylons' religiosity. *Adama's relationship with Sharon is evolving. In \\"Resurrection Ship\\" he calls her \\"she\\" and \\"her\\"; in previous episodes he had called her \\"it\\". *Starbuck is conflicted over her loyalty to Adama and Apollo and her hope that Cain will help her rescue Anders. Her improved \\"demeanor, behavior and even appearance\\" demonstrate her determination to perform well as CAG. *Usually Head Six has control when Baltar speaks to her and a third party simultaneously, but the power dynamic is reversed when he talks to Gina. Amanda Keith of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group disputes Starbuck's assertion in the eulogy that the fleet was safer with Cain in command; Keith attributes Starbuck's assessment to dissatisfaction with Adama and Roslin's leadership and ignorance of Cain's past misdeeds. Keith also believes Roslin is mistaken in her assessment of Cain as irredeemable; after all, Cain did back down from killing Adama. Keith writes that Baltar believes he can reclaim his missing love by rescuing Gina, but Gina is too \\"broken\\" to reciprocate his feelings. Keith compares Baltar's fancy on this point to Cain's impossible dream of reclaiming the irradiated Twelve Colonies from the Cylons. She regards Baltar's actions in the episode as irresponsible and driven by his exclusive focus on his immediate surroundings. Jennifer Stoy cites Roslin's call for Cain's assassination to argue that Battlestar Galactica challenges gender stereotypes, at least in its early seasons. Analysis Instead of giving Starbuck the order to kill Cain, Adama muses, \\"It's not enough to survive. One has to be worthy of surviving.\\"Part 2, minute 31:05. In Moore's view, this reflects \\"one of the key tenets of the show.\\" Clifton compares the conflict between Cain's urge to fight the Cylons and Roslin and Adama's commitment to maintaining civil society to the struggle between Adama and Roslin in the miniseries over whether to fight the Cylons or flee. Jason Davis of Mania writes that mortality is a central theme of \\"Resurrection Ship\\". He cites Adama and Cain's assassination plots and their regrets over them, Adama inspecting his surgical scar, Starbuck and Fisks's mutual wishes of \\"good hunting\\", and Apollo and Gina's death wishes. Clifton argues that Cain's decision to execute Helo and Tyrol is correct given the position she is in. In his view, the audience's prejudices in favor of the two men do not apply to her character because she does not know them. Clifton argues further that Roslin pushes for Adama to assassinate Cain because she expects her cancer to kill her soon and considers Baltar, who as Vice President would succeed her, unfit to stand up to Cain. Moore notes that Cain accomplished all her goals except for her own survival. Clifton compares her pursuit of the Cylons to Captain Ahab's pursuit of Moby- Dick. In Moore's view, the audience is supposed to feel ambivalent about Gina. On one hand, she perpetrated genocide along with the rest of her kind. On the other hand, her situation inspires sympathy. Clifton suggests a homoerotic undertone to the blanket party. Production \\"Resurrection Ship\\" was originally written and shot as a single episode, with the assassination plots hatched at the end of the second act. After editing the episode was still about 20 minutes too long, so it was split. This allowed for more detail within each part and caused plans for a clip show later in the second season to be scrapped. Part 2 opens with several shots of Apollo imagining floating in water as he drifts in space; this would have opened the single episode. Director Michael Rymer came up with the specific imagery of Apollo floating on his back. The writers decided on Cain's fate in early drafts of \\"Resurrection Ship\\". They also decided early on to allow Pegasus to remain in the fleet; Moore believed this would subvert the audience's expectation that the more powerful battlestar would be destroyed at the end of the episode. Originally the conflict between Cain and Adama was to center around Cain's failure to protect civilian decoys during the battle with the Cylons despite a promise to Roslin. At one point during writing, the script explained why Roslin does not promote Adama over Cain to defuse the situation: Roslin knows Cain does not accept her authority as President and would not obey Adama's orders. Apollo's experience ejecting and witnessing the destruction of the enemy ships was based on the experience of George H. Gay, Jr., in the Battle of Midway during World War II. Plans to include footage of the wrecked Raptor and its dead personnel along with Apollo were scrapped due to the difficulty of creating the shots and the feeling that it would be too morbid. Plans for additional action in Apollo's swimming fantasy were abandoned as \\"too esoteric\\". Gina was initially scripted to embrace and kiss Baltar. This was removed after actress Tricia Helfer (Six/Gina) noted that Gina, a victim of serial rape, would not be willing to do this. A scene in Part 1 in which Helo and Tyrol discuss Sharon and the blanket party scene in Part 2 used to be the same scene; the characters are in the same physical positions at the end of the first and the start of the second. The scenes were split when the episode was split. The blanket party was inspired by the films Full Metal Jacket and The Grifters. The writers referred to the Pegasus crewmen administering the beatings as the \\"Yee-Haw Boys\\"; in the episode Helo calls them \\"the Sunshine Boys\\". Their confrontation with Fisk was inspired by Moore's own experience in the U.S. Navy ROTC. The kiss between Adama and Roslin was not scripted. Actor Edward James Olmos (Adama) improvised it on set. Actress Mary McDonnell (Roslin)'s surprise is genuine. The Viper standoff was especially time-consuming to write and film. The writers considered having the Vipers open fire shortly before Starbuck appears, but they feared the consequences for morale and cohesion in the fleet. Cain's code word \\"Case Orange\\" for Fisk to kill Adama refers to War Plan Orange, a contingency plan developed by the American military before the Second World War in case of a Japanese attack. Cain's specific directive to \\"terminate Adama's command, starting with Adama\\" is an homage to a line delivered by Harrison Ford's character in Apocalypse Now referring to Kurtz. Adama's code word \\"Downfall\\" for Starbuck to kill Cain refers to the German film of that name or possibly Operation Downfall, the planned Allied invasion of Japan at the end of the Second World War.Although in his podcast commentary Moore explicitly cites the film Downfall as the reference for Adama's codeword, other obvious references would include Operation Downfall, the planned Allied invasion of the Japanese home islands at the end of the Second World War. Reception \\"Resurrection Ship\\" received positive critical reviews. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad called the episode \\"amazing\\" and praised the scenes between Baltar and Gina, Apollo's swimming fantasy, and the special effects. Amanda Keith called Part 1 \\"a fantastic episode\\" and praised the battle, composer Bear McCreary's score, and Adama and Roslin's final scene in Part 2. Clifton gave Part 1 an A, praising the moral ambiguity around Cain's actions, Olmos's performance, the editing of the final scene in which Cain and Adama give their assassination orders, and Starbuck, Adama, and Fisk's reluctance to participate in the assassination plots. He gave Part 2 an A+, calling actress Michelle Forbes (Cain)'s performance \\"wonderful\\", the battle scenes \\"awesome\\", the battle music \\"[g]rand, wonderful, sad and angry and terrible\\", and the final scene between Adama and Roslin \\"candid and weird and perfect and sad.\\" Davis gave Part 1 an A+ and Part 2 an A, praising Rymer's writing and Forbes's performance. Simon Brew of Den of Geek lauded the battle scene but said the rest of the episode was even better; he called it \\"all the more impressive for not doing what you'd expect it to do.\\" Rose Wojnar of The San Diego Union-Tribune gave Part 1 an A- but Part 2 a B-, praising Forbes and Sackhoff's acting and the battle scene but calling Gina killing Cain \\"too good of a solution\\". John Kubicek of BuddyTV ranked \\"Resurrection Ship\\" as the series's 18th best episode. Eric Goldman of IGN ranked \\"Admiral Cain's reign\\" in \\"Pegasus\\" and \\"Resurrection Ship\\" second on his list of the series's top \\"storylines and moments\\", praising Forbes's performance and calling the three episodes \\"riveting\\". Connection to other series elements More of Battlestar Pegasuss backstory is presented in the television movie Battlestar Galactica: Razor: *Cain and Gina were lovers until the Cylon attack on the Colonies. *The raids on the civilian ships are shown exactly as Fisk describes them in \\"Resurrection Ship\\". The \\"Sunshine Boys\\" were introduced in \\"Pegasus\\" bragging about raping Gina and plans to rape Sharon. They resurface in the fourth-season episode \\"The Oath\\", in which they take Sharon, Helo, Tyrol, and others prisoner during a mutiny.

In cases of homogeneous terrain with few distinct features, a bearing between 2 known points on the map may be used. Consequently, most thumb compasses have minimal or no degree markings at all, and are normally used only to take bearings directly from a map, and to orient a map to magnetic north. Thumb compasses are also often transparent so that an orienteer can hold a map in the hand with the compass and see the map through the compass. Thumb compasses attach to one's thumb using a small elastic band. The first commercially successful orienteering thumb compass was the Norcompass, introduced by Suunto in 1983. Placing an even greater emphasis on speed over accuracy, the wrist compass lacks even a baseplate, consisting solely of a needle capsule strapped to the carpometacarpal joint at the base of the thumb; the thumb serves the function of a baseplate when taking and sighting bearings. It is often used for city and park race orienteering.

J fights Garai in his true form (Cobra Man) in a heated battle. After he kills Garai, J is digested by Fog Mother as he tries to save Kana. Absorbing the life energy around him, J kills Fog Mother's newborn offspring, escapes from her bowels and assumes the Jumbo Formation. After ripping Kana out of Fog Mother, J kills the monster. Escaping Fog Mother's destruction, Kouji brings Kana to a peaceful place as Berry watches from a distance. Characters * : An environmentalist reporter who is killed by the Fog Mother's child, Agito, when they take Kana. He is revived as by the Earth Spirits to defend the planet from the Fog Mother and her children. With his transformation belt, J can perform the . His greatest ability is to assume the by gathering the life force from surrounding life forms, growing to tall to fight larger opponents. In this state, J can perform the . He rides a , a Suzuki road bike (2012 Suzuki DR650SE) which can reach a speed of . J can use the J-Crosser to execute the attack. Early designs by Shotaro Ishinomori gave Kamen Rider J a pair of wing-like appendages on his back to indicate the origin of the character's powers.Kamen Rider Art Collection: Hero Edition (). Page 72-74, June 2003. * : Kouji's young friend, who is captured by Fog Mother's children so she can be sacrificed. * : A large grasshopper who is Kamen Rider J's guide for the Earth Spirits. Fog are a group of monsters whose presence is signaled by mist. Every millennium, the Fog Mother gives birth to a new brood to feed on the occupants of the world on which she landed. One such brood was responsible for the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, which were their sole food supply. Seventy-five million years later, the Fog Mother returns to Earth with a new brood. Her three children say a ritual prayer before going out to obtain a sacrifice for their siblings to feed on so they can consume the human race. * : The Fog Mother, an alien parasite in a gold battle fortress who sends her three oldest children to obtain a human sacrifice for their unborn siblings to feed on before devouring the rest of the human race, is responsible for exterminating the dinosaurs. Her machine body can shoot gatling guns, shoot a laser from her right eye, emit circular-saw blades from her left eye, lower pincers to grab and emit insect-like legs from her torso to attack. She can feel pain if her machine is attacked. After Garai is killed, Fog Mother attempts to digest J but he enlarges and kills her newborn offspring. He impales the Fog Mother with his fist to pull out Kana. J frees himself from her clutches, breaking her pincers and insect-like legs and using a Jumbo Rider Kick to damage her body as it begins to self-detonate. In a last effort to destroy Kamen Rider J, she drags him back into her body but he frees himself and kills her with a Rider Punch as her machine body explodes. * : The oldest of the Fog Mother's children, assuming the form of a young man. He is called \\"Prince\\" by the Fog Mother. His true form is , an armored cobra-like monster with a laser saber and a constricting whip who can use a ball which turns into a claw. He conducts the prayer ceremony while his younger siblings battle J and takes on J to keep the sacrifice going until Berry comes to J's aid. With Kana in the egg chamber and Berry knocked out, Garai absorbs the surrounding mist and assumes his true form. Kamen Rider J impales him with a sharp object, and Garai uses his ball attack. Kamen Rider J frees himself from it and uses the Rider Kick to knock Garai unto the altar, fatally injuring him. * : Assuming the form of a young woman, her true form is the : a colorful female bee monster, with wings on her head and the ability to shoot needles from her hands. She kidnapped Kana for the sacrifice. When Agito's death is learned, Zu is sent to avenge her brother. She uses crimson ribbons to trap Kouji and drop him from the sky after she sheds her human form, but he becomes Kamen Rider J and overpowers her. She shoots him in the arm with a needle, grabs him and takes him up in the air. Zu, mortally wounded when she collides with the Fog Mother's ship, sees Garai one last time before she dies and fades into the mist. * : Assuming the form of a middle-aged man, his true form is : an alligator-like monster with poisonous fangs and a constricting tail. He killed Kouji, and is determined to kill him again when he learns he is still alive. When he encounters Kouji (as Kamen Rider J), he sheds his human form and attacks him. Agito tries to escape by climbing a cliff, but Kamen Rider J kills him with a Rider Punch to his head and he falls to his death. Other appearances Kamen Rider J joined Kamen Rider ZO in the eight-minute 3D film, Kamen Rider World, and appeared in the 2009 film Kamen Rider Decade: All Riders vs. Dai-Shocker.

It aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on January 20, 2006. In the episode, President Laura Roslin orders Sharon's pregnancy terminated. The order is suspended after Gaius Baltar discovers that the fetus's blood can cure Roslin's cancer, which it does. Baltar aligns himself with an underground group of Cylon sympathizers whose ranks include the troubled Number Six copy Gina. Plot Roslin lies near death in Galacticas sickbay. Doctor Cottle reports abnormalities in Sharon's unborn child's blood. Believing the child a threat to the fleet, Roslin orders her pregnancy terminated over Baltar's objections. Head Six, who regards Sharon's child as hers with Baltar, appears to Baltar and insists he intervene. Roslin's decision outrages Sharon and Helo, the child's father, who obstructs the entrance to sickbay. Baltar defuses the standoff by announcing that a transfusion of the fetus's abnormal blood may save Roslin's life. The procedure cures Roslin's cancer within days. In a sequence of delirious flashbacks, Roslin recalls negotiating an end to a teachers' strike on Caprica as Secretary of Education. Her conciliatory approach angered then-President Richard Adar, with whom she was having an affair, but she refused to back down. She also recalls seeing Baltar with a Number Six shortly before the Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies. A civilian crew member sabotages some ammunition. An investigation reveals she is a member of Demand Peace, an underground group of Cylon sympathizers. Admiral William Adama feigns negotiation with Demand Peace only to arrest its representative, Royan Jahee, when he arrives on Galactica. Demand Peace bombs a fuel refinery ship. Roslin meets with Jahee, agrees to hear his group's case, and warns that further violence will lead to harsh measures. Baltar meets secretly with Gina on Cloud Nine. Gina rejects his sexual advances but invites him to join Demand Peace; Baltar refuses. Head Six laments that saving Roslin's life prevented Baltar, who is Vice President, from becoming President. Baltar concludes from a letter Roslin wrote to him in the event of her death that she will never trust him. Jahee returns to Cloud Nine and presents Gina with a gift from Baltar: a nuclear warhead Adama provided Baltar for research purposes in an earlier episode. Analysis In his podcast commentary on \\"Epiphanies\\", executive producer Ronald D. Moore discussed his views the episode's portrayal of several of the characters. *Before becoming President, Roslin would have been horrified by a presidential edict to terminate a pregnancy, but her circumstances have forced her to become gradually more comfortable making tough decisions. *Gina rejects Baltar sexually because of the abuse she endured while a prisoner on Pegasus; actress Tricia Helfer (Gina/Six) came up with this notion. Gina's unavailability frustrates Baltar, who was motivated to help Gina partially by his desire to sleep with her. *Helo coming to attention after Adama dismisses him is intended as a genuine gesture of respect. *Moore speculates that Baltar saves Roslin because he feels unready for the Presidency. Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity notes that \\"Epiphanies\\" considers a number of \\"endings\\" for Roslin: of her cancer, her affair with Adar, her job as Secretary of Education (from which Adar asks her to resign), and the Twelve Colonies. He muses that these are commingled because it can be difficult to separate the big \\"apocalypses\\" from the small ones. He compares Roslin's interaction with Jahee to her negotiation with the striking teachers: in both cases she has to protect a constituency (teachers or civilians) in the face of a zealous leader who will happily crush them for misbehavior (Adar or Adama). Clifton argues that Roslin wants to abort Sharon's fetus not because of a security risk but because the doubts that Baltar could maintain the cover-up of Sharon's presence on Galactica if he became President. He further argues that Adama is ambivalent about carrying out Roslin's order but understands her motivation. Rose Wojnar of The San Diego Union-Tribune notes that the conflict over Roslin's order \\"mirrors the abortion debate in today's world\\". Clifton compares the triad of Roslin, Sharon, and her unborn daughter with the Triple Goddess concept. In a review of a later episode, he says Demand Peace is \\"right about everything\\". Emphasis his. Production Moore described \\"Epiphanies\\" as \\"our biggest Laura Roslin show to date.\\" The writers decided to introduce a cure for Roslin's cancer so they could include her in the rest of the series without progressively worsening her conditions. They also found attractive the idea of complicating Roslin's role as the prophesied leader of humanity, who is supposed to be dying. They considered basing the treatment on embryonic stem cells harvested from the fetus to connect the episode to real-world debates over stem cells, but this was rejected as medically implausible and gimmicky. Moore felt that the series had not paid enough attention to different points of view within the fleet. Demand Peace was developed to demonstrate dissenting opinions, which Moore regards as inevitable in any body politic. He also considered it \\"a healthy exercise\\" for him and the other Battlestar Galactica writers, whom he described as generally liberal, to write an episode whose antagonists belong to the political left. He notes that Adama's harsh treatment of Jahee runs counter to actor Edward James Olmos's politics, as well. However, Moore emphasized in his podcast commentary that the episode, like the rest of the series, is not intended to be polemical or allegorical to real-world events. The writers considered waiting several episodes before re-introducing Head Six after her disappearance in \\"Resurrection Ship\\", but Moore felt that \\"Baltar was less interesting without Six.\\" Instead they inserted dialogue to indicate that several weeks had passed without Six appearing to Baltar. The succession letter is based on a real-world tradition in which each outgoing President of the United States leaves a letter for his successor in the Oval Office. The letter that appears in the episode is less complimentary than letters that appeared in early drafts. Moore confessed it was unrealistic that Demand Peace would not recognize Gina as a Number Six copy despite her eyeglasses and different hairstyle. Reception \\"Epiphanies\\" received lukewarm critical review. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad called Demand Peace \\"interesting\\" but wrote, \\"After an amazing double-part season premiere [\\"Resurrection Ship\\"], the show tones down a little.\\" Amanda Keith of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group called the episode's flaws \\"numerous\\". Clifton gave the episode a B-, praising the editing and several actors' performances but mocking the episode's technobabble and \\"mangled logic\\". Wojnar gave the episode an A-, citing relief over Roslin's cure but noting \\"some bad acting and some uneven editing.\\" Simon Brew of Den of Geek praised Mary McDonnell (Roslin)'s performance. Connection to other series elements *Gina detonates the warhead in the second-season finale, \\"Lay Down Your Burdens, Part 2\\", destroying Cloud Nine and inadvertently signaling the human fleet's position to the other Cylons. *Roslin's cancer is only in remission; by the third-season finale, \\"Crossroads, Part 2\\", it has returned.

Billings. Billings was a veteran of the 10th Massachusetts Volunteer Light Artillery Battery in the American Civil War. Originally published in 1888, Hard Tack and Coffee quickly became a best seller, and is now considered one of the most important books written by a Civil War veteran. The book is abundantly illustrated by the pen and ink drawings of Charles W. Reed, also a veteran, who served as bugler in the 9th Massachusetts Battery, later received the Medal of Honor for saving the life of his battery commander at Gettysburg. Hard Tack and Coffee is not about battles, but rather about how the common Union soldiers of the Civil War lived in camp and on the march. What would otherwise be a mundane subject is enlivened by Billings' humorous prose and Reed's superb drawings which are based on the sketches he kept in his journal during the war. The book is noteworthy as it covers the details of regular soldier life, and as such has become a valuable resource for Civil War reenactors. The volume is divided into twenty-one chapters which treat the origins of the Civil War, enlisting, how soldiers were sheltered, life in tents, life in log huts, unlucky soldiers and shirkers (\\"Jonahs and Beats\\"), Army rations, offenses and punishments, a day in camp, raw recruits, special rations and boxes from home, foraging, corps and corps badges, some inventions and devices of the war, the army mule, hospitals and ambulances, clothing, breaking camp and marching, army wagon trains, road and bridge builders, and signal flags and torches. Some of the information is specific to Billings' experiences as a Massachusetts volunteer artillery veteran. However, much of it is very useful to anyone researching or simply reading about the ordinary soldier in the Union army. Reed's drawings add a great deal to the text.John D. Billings, Hard Tack and Coffee: Soldier's Life in the Civil War (Old Sybrook, Ct., Konecky & Konecky, no date). Billings has been described as a skilful writer, both humorous and informative.

It is an alternative and often preferred way of describing \\"reverse engineering\\" software and hardware. The term originated in a 2005 Society of Manufacturing Engineers' \\"Blue Book\\"Peter Marks, Capturing a Competitive Edge Through Digital Shape Sampling & Processing (DSSP), SME Blue Book Series, 2005, PDF on the topic, which referenced numerous suppliers of both scanning hardware and processing software. DSSP employs various 3D scanning methods, including laser scanners, to acquire thousands to millions of points on the surface of a form and then software from a variety of suppliers to convert the resulting \\"point cloud\\" into forms useful for inspection, computer-aided design, visualization and other applications. It may also employ volumetric methods of scanning, such as digital tomography. Some common applications include CAI (computer-aided inspection), creation of 3D CAD models from scanned data, medical applications, 3D imaging for Web 2.0 applications, and the restoration of culturally significant artifacts; as well as conventional reverse engineering for creating replacement parts. The term 'reverse engineering' itself has acquired some notoriety when the technology has been used to copy others' designs. The term 'laser scanning' has also been used somewhat interchangeably for DSSP. However, there are two problems with the term as a broad description of the field. First, it is only one of many alternative scanning technologies. Second, it misses the essential role of processing software in converting point cloud data into useful forms. In some ways, DSSP is a 3D analog to DSP (digital signal processing) in that the software attempts to extract a clear and accurate 3D image from point data that may include noise. The notion of 'shape sampling' embedded in the term also acknowledges that, as in many measurement processes, the accuracy of the 3D data will depend upon the number and accuracy of points sampled. The speed and accuracy of both scanners to acquire data and software algorithms to extract useful data has dramatically increased in recent years. The amount of data capturing capability has also increased many fold, due to the advances in the camera technology and faster , more powerful computers. As some the limitations of the technology are eliminated and costs reduced, more uses are appearing.

It aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on January 27, 2006. In the episode, Apollo's investigation of the fleet's black market becomes intertwined with his involvement with a prostitute. The episode was a disappointment both to executive producer Ronald D. Moore and to critics, several of whom called it the series's worst episode.https://web.archive.org/web/20090619165802/http://blogs.scifi.com/battlestar/archives/2005/10/ Plot Haunted by his near-death experience after ejecting from the Blackbird, Apollo begins sleeping with Shevon, a prostitute on Cloud Nine who reminds him of his pregnant girlfriend who died in the Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies. Dee asks Apollo whether their relationship is going anywhere; he brushes her off. President Laura Roslin decides to crack down on the black market within the fleet. Commander Jack Fisk at first advises against it but then volunteers Pegasus to take the lead. Fisk is later found garrotted in his quarters. Assigned to investigate the murder, Apollo discovers Fisk was heavily involved in the black market, and that Vice President Gaius Baltar and Colonel Saul Tigh were among Fisk's trading partners. Roslin privately asks Baltar to resign; the suggestion insults Baltar and redoubles his determination to stay in office. Responding to an emergency call from Shevon, Apollo rushes to Cloud Nine to find her bruised and distressed. Thugs enter Shevon's room and attack Apollo. As he is being strangled, a gangster tells Apollo to stop investigating Fisk's murder, threatens Shevon and her daughter Paya if he refuses, and knocks Apollo out. Apollo wakes to find Shevon and Paya gone and the wielder of the garrote murdered. Tom Zarek enters the room soon after. He claims he refused to join Fisk's smuggling network and suggests that the murderer's corpse was given to Apollo as \\"a way out\\" of his investigation. Apollo is not dissuaded, so Zarek mentions a man named Phelan who runs the black market and gives Apollo the location of his ship. On Phelan's ship, Apollo discovers the black market is hoarding antibiotics and trafficking in children; Paya is among their prisoners. Phelan, who turns out to be the gangster from before, reveals that Shevon works for him and defends the black market as necessary. Apollo offers Phelan amnesty if he will release Shevon and Paya and shut down his operation. When Phelan refuses, Apollo wrests a bodyguard's handgun and kills Phelan. Apollo acknowledges that the fleet needs the black market and so doesn't shut it down. However, he warns the smugglers to remove the human smuggling, hoarding and murder parts of their operation or he will shut them down. Roslin objects but acquiesces to the resolution. Zarek makes his way aboard Phelan's ship surrounded by his men, indicating that Zarek will take over the black market. Shevon refuses to see Apollo again, saying she cannot replace his lost love. Dee returns to Billy Keikeya. Production Apollo's journey through the fleet's criminal underground culminating with the encounter with Phelan was inspired by Heart of Darkness. The writers were initially excited by the combination of this storytelling device with the opportunity to complicate Apollo's character. Moore was happy with the script when it was written but gradually came to believe the episode was deeply flawed. In October 2005 he wrote, in reference to the still unaired \\"Black Market\\", that he was \\"positively angry with myself at something I knew in my bones had fallen well below the bar I set for myself and for the show in general.\\" In particular, he felt that the episode was too conventional in its story and execution. Moore attributed what he considered a drop in quality from other episodes to the second season's increased production schedule; nonetheless, he insisted that the responsibility belonged with him rather than with the circumstances or with anyone else who worked on the episode. Moore was particularly disappointed with how the black market's illegality is established. At first, Moore notes, it is difficult to see what distinction Roslin makes between legitimate and illicit commerce in a post- apocalyptic environment. The distinction may only become clear to the audience once the child trafficking is revealed, but Moore came to regard this as a \\"cheap\\" dodge of the dilemma. Reception Critics mostly shared Moore's disappointment with \\"Black Market\\". Rose Wojnar of The San Diego Union-Tribune gave the episode a D+, calling it \\"one of the weakest, if not the weakest, episode of an otherwise outstanding series so far.\\" Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity gave it a D, writing, \\"Good acting is marred by nonsensical plot and unreadable dialogue.\\" Clifton later elaborated that the episode \\"sucked hard\\". Keith McDuffee of TV Squad considered the episode unrealistic and unnecessary. Amanda Keith of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group wrote, \\"'Black Market, one of the most reviled episodes of the entire series, deserves it.\\" Simon Brew of Den of Geek wrote, \\"this probably the weakest episode of the show [so far] ... [but] it still manages to blast pretty much every other show off the screen.\\" Jason Davis of Mania gave \\"Black Market\\" an A-, praising the development of Apollo's character and Bill Duke's performance but criticizing the plot; nonetheless, Davis called it \\"better than most of the programming on TV.\\" In September 2007, Adam Swiderski of UGO called \\"Black Market\\" the series's worst episode, calling it \\"one big, confused mess that has nothing to do with anything\\". StephenFlagg (Dean Spence) of ScrewAttack also called it the series's worst episode, but said, \\"Bad? Yes. Boring? Yes. Terrible?

It aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on February 3, 2006. In the episode, Viper pilots Starbuck and Kat form a rivalry over which of them will destroy Scar, a feared Cylon Raider. Tormented by her feelings for Sam Anders, Starbuck nearly allows Scar to kill her in a game of chicken. In the end, she swerves and lures Scar to Kat, who destroys Scar. Executive producer Ronald D. Moore insisted that the episode include only one dogfight. As a result, the episode focuses on the differences between Starbuck and Kat and how their personalities come into conflict rather than on space combat. Their mutual animosity has been identified as an inversion of typical gender roles, especially in comparison with the male pilot Apollo. According to one analysis, Scar represents more than just a professional rivalry, but both characters' personal demons. Critical reception to \\"Scar\\" was mostly positive. The episode appeared on several retrospective \\"best of\\" lists. Plot Drunk in the pilots' mess, Starbuck vows to destroy Scar, a Raider known as the Cylons' ace of aces and dreaded for his sneak attacks. Kat challenges Starbuck, getting her to bet her beer stein labeled \\"Galactica Top Gun\\". Later, Kat interrupts Starbuck during a briefing, breaks her record in a test of shooting a side arm accurately while dizzy, and chastises her after her advice gets a rookie pilot killed by Scar. Sharon warns Starbuck that Scar is likely so competent and bloodthirsty because \\"he\\" has died and been resurrected many times. With the Cylon Resurrection ship gone, destroying him would make his death permanent. Starbuck is troubled by memories of Anders, whom she promised to rescue from Caprica; Admiral William Adama and President Laura Roslin have refused to order a rescue mission. After the rookie's death, she drunkenly comes on to Apollo but rejects him during foreplay. They fight over her feelings for Anders. She leaves and continues drinking while watching archival gun camera footage of Scar. Later, Starbuck is hung over and assigns another pilot to take her place on patrol. When Scar kills her inexperienced wingman, Kat blames Starbuck. They trade insults. Starbuck taunts Kat for her fear of Scar, and Kat punches Starbuck. Apollo arrives, cutting the altercation short. He orders the two pilots to fly together to protect a mining operation in an asteroid field. As Starbuck and Kat patrol in their Vipers, Kat pursues a Raider she believes to be Scar. As Starbuck checks behind them, the real Scar appears and damages Starbuck's Viper. Starbuck plays chicken with Scar, to Kat's horror. Remembering her promise to Anders, Starbuck swerves at the last moment. She lures Scar into Kat's line of fire, and Kat shoots him down. Back in the mess, Starbuck yields her stein to Kat and toasts a succession of pilots who have perished since the war began. She claimed previously that she could not remember their names. Later, while practicing boxing with Helo, she admits that, before she met Anders, she would have not thought twice about dying in the process of killing Scar, while Helo tells her that letting Kat take the shot was the right decision. She tells Helo that she can't get over the hope that Anders might still be alive, despite the unlikelihood. Helo suggests that before meeting Anders, Starbuck had something to die for, but now she has something to live for. Characterization Moore notes that, despite Starbuck's reputation as a superior fighter pilot, \\"Scar\\" demonstrates a number of her character flaws and poor choices. He cites her obsessive competition with Kat, her drinking, and her ill conceived attempt to sleep with Apollo. Writers David Weddle and Bradley Thompson based Starbuck's portrayal in \\"Scar\\" in part on their fathers, whom Weddle described as \\"war veterans who were very conflicted and self-destructive\\". Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity sees the episode in part as a deconstruction of the myth of Starbuck as a perfect pilot, a myth embraced by the characters, particularly Kat, and the audience alike. Kieran Tranter echoes this analysis, noting that her competence as a pilot was unquestioned in the series before \\"Scar\\". Thompson contrasts Starbuck's attitude toward the new pilots with Kat's. Where Starbuck has become jaded by seeing so many rookies killed in battle, Kat reaches out to them with advice and genuine concern. Moore contrasts Apollo's calm in \\"Scar\\" with Starbuck and Kat's mutual animosity and suggests that this amounts to a reversal of gender roles. Clifton also notes that the episode plays a \\"Flip the Genders game.\\" Moore observes that Starbuck opens up to Helo in \\"Scar\\" more than she opens up to Apollo; the series established previously that she and Helo are old friends. Clifton contends that Helo, as a pilot of Raptors rather than Vipers, does not fully understand Starbuck's loss, but he makes up for it by being instinctively supportive. Clifton sees Starbuck's anguish over leaving Anders as a manifestation of a recurring tension in the series between the impulses to \\"'Stay and fight' or 'Run and rebuild'\\" when fighting would mean certain death. Anders represents what Starbuck could have had if the Cylons had not destroyed the Twelve Colonies. His absence also allows Starbuck to project away her feelings instead of confronting them. Clifton notes further that Starbuck's status as an adult survivor of child abuse complicates her feelings on these issues. Clifton reflects on what Scar represents to Starbuck and Kat. Overall, he writes, \\"the real truth is not that nailing Scar is a competition for them; the real truth is that Scar has become each other, and everything that takes things away from them.\\"Clifton; emphasis his. For both of them, this goes beyond fear of the Cylons in general. For Starbuck, Scar embodies her anxiety over the mysterious operation the Cylons performed on her on CapricaIn \\"The Farm\\". and the abuse in her past; Clifton notes both these experiences left literal scars on Starbuck. For Kat, Scar embodies her fear of not being as good as Starbuck and her fear of letting the fleet down, which in the past caused her to turn to abuse stimulants. Kat and some other pilots try to remember the name of a fallen comrade's girlfriend who died in the attack on the Colonies, but Starbuck considers it pointless. Clifton suggests Kat identifies with the dead woman more than Starbuck because Kat was a civilian until she signed up as a pilot during the series. He also notes a similarity between the names that are guessed (Kathy, Katherine, Kassie, Karen), Kat's call sign, and Starbuck's first name, Kara. Production Moore wanted an episode focused on Viper pilots like the first-season episode \\"Act of Contrition\\". In particular, he wanted to explore their daily lives aboard Galactica and their tactics in battle. Writers David Weddle and Bradley Thompson kept the episode from becoming too \\"industrial\\" by incorporating executive producer David Eick's desire for a confrontation between Starbuck and Kat. Weddle compared \\"Scar\\" to the film Battleground for its focus on the individual pilots. Moore restricted the writers to one dogfight in this episode. To increase the dramatic tension, Weddle and Thompson began the episode at the start of Starbuck and Kat's patrol and told the bulk of the story in flashbacks; inserted more opportunities for Starbuck and Kat to clash on Galactica; and wrote another dogfight to be narrated over radio. The writers went over the script in detail with Moore in a July 2005 writers' meeting that was recorded and published by podcast. one key plot point they discussed at length was a motive for Galactica staying in one place while Scar shoots down its fighters one at a time. Slate summarized the ensuing discussion: > One writer suggests that they're fixing the engines (a true standby of > science fiction, one that served Star Trek for decades). Another writer > proposes that ...Vipers are vulnerable because they're flying attenuated, > long-distance patrols. Moore eventually decides that the fleet must have > manufacturing facilities, but needs raw material, some magic metal for > building Vipers found only where the ship is stuck. 'Then it can influence > the conversations in the ready room,' Moore says, 'because of the > psychological toll on the pilots. Now their machines are more valuable than > they are.' A scene of auctioning off a recently killed rookie pilot's belongings was written and filmed, but it was cut from the episode. Moore felt it was too jarring a scene to include in the episode. He compared the practice of new pilots taking dead pilots' bunks to a scene from Full Metal Jacket. The chair in which the pilots spin to get dizzy before their accuracy test was based on a similar device Moore saw at Edwards Air Force Base; the test there was to point one's finger accurately rather than to fire a weapon. Thompson based Scar's technique of flying at Starbuck with the sun behind him obscure her vision on a technique described in World War II pilot Pappy Boyington's autobiography, Baa Baa Black Sheep. A diagram shown on a whiteboard in the ready room during Starbuck's briefing was taken from a textbook on fighter tactics. The visual effects in \\"Scar\\" were particularly difficult and time- consuming to produce. The last visual effects shots were finished in the week before the episode aired. In a rare break from the series's cin√©ma v√©rit√© style, director Michael Nankin slows down time as Starbuck remembers Anders in the moments before she swerves from Scar. The episode closes with Stanley Myers's classical guitar piece \\"Cavatina\\", the theme from the 1978 film The Deer Hunter. Reception Critical reaction to \\"Scar\\" was mostly positive. Rose Wojnar of The San Diego Union-Tribune gave \\"Scar\\" a B+, praising the \\"great action scenes and for some gut-wrenching emotional ones\\" but criticizing the narrative device of cutting back and forth between the final encounter with Scar and earlier action. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad also lamented the \\"time shifting\\" but liked the episode overall. Clifton gave \\"Scar\\" an A-, praising actress Luciana Carro performance as Kat and the editing. He later elaborated, \\"I liked 'Scar' as a well-done story, but in the middle of a lackluster and unrepentantly heterogeneous season, I could have done without.\\" Amanda Keith of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group noted that Katee Sackhoff's portrayal of Starbuck had evolved from a \\"larger-than life character\\" to one that is \\"one hundred different kinds of frakked up\\". Keith called it \\"a remarkable transformation, and another sign that the [Battlestar Galactica] actors really was robbed of Emmy glory.\\" Simon Brew of Den of Geek called \\"Scar\\" \\"not one of the best episodes to date, I thought, but an improvement on 'Black Market' [the previous episode]\\". Right before the series finale, as part of a retrospective look at the series, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger included \\"Scar\\" on his list of favorite episodes, calling it a \\"great self-contained show, and one of the best showcases Katee Sackhoff ever got, as we spend an entire hour just living with the Viper pilots and getting a better sense of the emotional toll of war without end for the toughest warrior of them all.\\" Michael Hickerson of Slice of SciFi ranked it as the series's fifth best episode. John Kubicek also ranked it fifth best, calling the scene in which Starbuck toasts the dead pilots \\"pure magic, and easily my favorite single scene in the history of the show.\\" Kelly Woo of TV Squad ranked \\"Scar\\" as the series's eighth best episode. Eric Goldman of IGN ranked Starbuck's showdown with Scar at #19 on his list of the series's top \\"storylines and moments\\", calling it a \\"visually strong battle sequence\\".

It aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on February 10, 2006. In the episode, Dee spurns Billy Keikeya and goes on a date with Lee \\"Apollo\\" Adama at a bar. An armed group takes control of the bar, demanding the captive Cylon Sharon in return for the lives of their hostages. Lee is badly wounded when Starbuck attempts a rescue. Billy is shot and killed saving Dee just before a team of Marines raids the bar and rescues the remaining hostages. The episode focuses on Admiral William Adama's relationship with Sharon as he weighs the gunmen's demands. It also presents the gunmen's motives and raises questions about whether there is merit to their point of view. According to executive producer Ronald D. Moore, Billy was killed to release actor Paul Campbell to do other projects. Campbell said in an interview that it was because he was unwilling to sign a five-year contract for the series. In early drafts of the episode, Colonel Saul Tigh clashed with Adama over his handling of the crisis, but in the final version episode the two of them and President Laura Roslin all agree that they cannot bow to the demands of a group they call terrorists. Critical reaction to \\"Sacrifice\\" was lukewarm. Moore discussed his own disappointment with several aspects of the episode in his podcast commentary on the episode. Plot The press has learned that a Number Eight model Cylon is being held in Galacticas brig. Admiral Adama insists to President Laura Roslin that Sharon is a valuable source of intelligence. Billy, Roslin's chief of staff, urges Adama to tell the fleet about Sharon. Billy proposes marriage to Dee, but Dee turns him down. Later he discovers Dee on a date with Lee in a bar on Cloud 9 and is heartbroken. Gunmen led by Sesha Abinell take over the bar, demanding that the Admiral hand over Sharon. Learning that Abinell is seeking revenge for her husband's death in a Cylon attack, Adama refuses and orders Starbuck to plan a rescue with several Marines. A ruse by Lee convinces the gunmen that the bar is losing oxygen, giving Starbuck an opening. Her attempt backfires, and she accidentally shoots Lee during the confusion. Dee and Billy attend the bleeding, unconscious Lee. Roslin argues to Admiral Adama and Colonel Tigh they cannot give in to terrorists. As Abinell threatens Ellen Tigh, who is among the hostages, Adama agrees to hand over Sharon, but not alive. Adama sends over the corpse of Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii, the Number Eight copy who shot him and died, to give Marines time to storm the bar. Abinell shoots Boomer's corpse but discovers the deception shortly after. She orders Dee killed. Against Dee's advice, Billy grabs a gun and shoots the would-be executioner dead. As he dies, the executioner also shoots and kills Billy. The Marines kill the remaining gunmen, including Abinell, and free the hostages. Roslin mourns Billy, whom she described as \\"the closest thing I have to family left\\". Dee awaits Lee's recovery in Galacticas sickbay as Starbuck looks on. Analysis Moore says in his podcast commentary on \\"Sacrifice\\" that the episode \\"is all about Sharon in some measure, because even though she's off- camera for most of it, all the events are driven by her presence and what she's about.\\" He notes that Sharon's motives and whether the humans can trust her are open questions. Moore says that Admiral Adama feels an emotional connection to Sharon despite her being a Cylon and despite having been nearly killed by another Number Eight copy. He contrasts this with Colonel Tigh, who is more skeptical. At several points in the episode, Tigh reminds Adama that Sharon is a machine, a \\"thing\\". Amanda Keith of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group writes that Adama's trust of Sharon places him apart from other characters in this episode and that Billy's life is the price of that trust. Moore notes that Abinell has a fundamentally different perspective on the events of the series than the audience. The audience sees the fleet's leadership in action and understands why Adama and Roslin make the decisions they do. By contrast, Abinell's perspective is shaped by what she hears from the press and other characters. Moore said one aim of the episode was to raise the question of whether the audience could understand her point of view and should sympathize with her. He also notes that, in at least one respect, Abinell is right where Adama and Roslin are wrong: she believes correctly that the defense ministry of the Twelve Colonies was infiltrated by Cylons before the Destruction of the Twelve Colonies. Abinell is also correct that Sharon is not being as helpful as she could be, she refuses to turn informer against other Cylon agents in the fleet. Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity argues that \\"all of her info is pretty much on target\\" and says her group and the Cylon sympathizer group Demand Peace \\"are right about everything\\".In \\"Epiphanies\\".Clifton; emphasis his. In his judgment she is wrong to take her grief out on the people in the bar, because everyone in the fleet has lost loved ones for no good reason. He also argues that Abinell's initial resistance to Adama's offer to bring Sharon dead and her violent reaction upon seeing the corpse prove that her motivations are personal rather than political. This accords with what he sees as one of the series's themes: that political questions and conflicts generally boil down to personal ones. Clifton connects Starbuck's botched rescue in \\"Sacrifice\\" with her failures in the previous episode, \\"Scar\\". He sees them as part of a disintegration of the professional competence that helps Starbuck endure her broken personal life. He compares the process of stripping Starbuck of her protection to Eustace Scrubb losing his dragon skin in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Production Moore said that Billy was killed in \\"Sacrifice\\" because Campbell was being offered good roles on other television series, and the scheduling conflicts were interfering with filming. The writers found it implausible that Billy would simply quit as Roslin's chief of staff and could not think of any other good excuses for the character to be missing from the narrative for long stretches, so they decided to kill the character. Moore called Campbell's departure sad and said in his podcast commentary, \\"It's not something I thought we'd be doing when the season began.\\" Campbell said in an interview that he was not surprised by the decision. He said that he was unwilling to sign a five-year contract, and the producers concluded he was not committed to the series. Moore said the plot was influenced by the film Dog Day Afternoon. In the film, as in \\"Sacrifice\\", a \\"true believer\\" stands at the top of the hostage takers, who are ultimately unprepared for the arrival of the authorities. Early drafts of the episode focused on a conflict between Admiral Adama and Colonel Tigh over the hostage situation. In these early versions, Tigh pressed Adama to give the hostage-takers what they asked for to protect Ellen. The confrontation was even supposed to turn violent. Eventually the writers decided that Tigh would not want to give in to the demands of people he considered terrorists, and the conflict was removed from the script. Moore notes that Adama and Roslin also have loved ones in the bar (Lee and Billy, respectively), but the emotional connection does not affect their decisions, either. In a scene that was cut because of time and financial constraints, Starbuck's presence aboard Cloud 9 was explained by showing her about to have a liaison with a man she had just met. This was intended as a counterpoint to Lee pursuing a relationship with Dee rather than Starbuck and as further demonstration of Starbuck's self-destruction over her feelings about Sam Anders. Moore noted that showing this in \\"Sacrifice\\" would have contradicted the previous episode, \\"Scar\\", in which Starbuck finds a measure of peace over Anders. Executive producer David Eick knew actress Dana Delany (Abinell) personally and convinced her to make a guest appearance in the series. He first approached her about it during the first season. The bar scenes were filmed on a film set rather than in an existing location. The writers considered having the hostage situation occur aboard a shuttle. They moved it to a bar because they did not have a shuttle set available, and building the bar was less complicated and less expensive. The shots of the Marines preparing for the final assault were taken from the first-season episode \\"Bastille Day\\". Reception \\"Sacrifice\\" received a lukewarm response from critics. Rose Wojnar of The San Diego Union-Tribune gave the episode a B-, criticizing \\"overuse of Sesha‚Äôs flashback of her husband dying and the predictable shot of her falling dead on Sharon‚Äôs body\\". Clifton gave \\"Sacrifice\\" a B+, praising Delany's performance but criticizing the lack of context for Lee and Dee's relationship. Overall, he called it \\"the best episode in a while\\". Keith McDuffee of TV Squad was glad to see Lee back to form after several difficult episodes but questioned the plausibility of the terrorists falling for the Boomer-switching trick. Amanda Keith responded favorably to the episode in general but felt the writers \\"flubbed how they portrayed [Dee's] relationship with Lee\\". Simon Brew of Den of Geek wrote, \\"it was good telly, but the show has inevitably struggled to recapture the flat- out brilliance of the middle of the season.\\" Moore felt the episode fell short in several respects. He felt that the episode did not spend enough time with Abinell, getting the audience to understand how the loss of her husband radicalized her after the loss of the Colonies did not; he said Delany's strong performance made up for some of this. He hoped there would be more tension surrounding how Admiral Adama, Roslin, and Colonel Tigh each had a loved one in the bar. He also disliked how Starbuck's raid was filmed and thought that the script fell short by not explaining why the Marines don't storm the bar from the back through the passage where Lee tampers with the oxygen sensor. Moore emphasized that he believed the episode's shortcomings were his responsibility as showrunner and that his criticisms were directed at himself and not at anyone else. He praised the performances of actors Jamie Bamber (Lee), Campbell, Kandyse McClure (Dee), Mary McDonnell (Roslin), and Katee Sackhoff (Starbuck). Overall, he called it \\"a decent episode, not my favorite but I don't think a disaster.\\" Notes and referencesExternal links * \\"Sacrifice\\" at the Battlestar Wiki * \\"Sacrifice\\" at Syfy * * Category:2006 American television episodes Category:Battlestar Galactica (season 2) episodes fr:Saison 2 de Battlestar Galactica#La Vengeance ","title":"Sacrifice (Battlestar Galactica)"},{"id":"4449066","text":"This is a list of notable Black Canadians, inclusive of multiracial people who are of partially Black African descent.

It aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on February 17, 2006. Plot Apollo, freshly promoted to Major, is assigned to the Battlestar Pegasus to assist her new captain, Commander Barry Garner, the ship's former senior engineer. When two Pegasus Raptors sent out on a routine training mission by Captain Starbuck disappear from DRADIS, Commander Garner places all blame on Starbuck, implying that she is negligent. On Galactica, Rya Kibby, a pregnant teen stowaway is discovered who seeks an abortion by Dr. Cottle. She requests political asylum while her Geminese family demands that she be returned to them. When the issue is brought to President Roslin, she initially embraces the legality of abortion prior to the Cylon attack, but is pressured by the representative of Gemenon - an important constituency for Roslin's run for reelection. When discussing this with Admiral Adama, he points out the need of babies for the survival of the human race. Vice President Baltar provides a calculation that at the current rate humanity will become extinct in 18 years. On Pegasus, Starbuck concludes that the missing raptors may have jumped away to answer a phony distress call, a common Cylon tactic. In light of the danger, Admiral Adama orders a cautious recon mission to find the missing ships. Commander Garner, discounting Starbuck's theory, jumps the Pegasus to the location where they find the missing crews dead and are attacked by three Cylon Basestars. With the FTL drive damaged, Garner places Apollo in command of the ship and rushes to repair the FTL drive. Apollo is able to fend off the attacking Basestars and buy time for Garner's engineering. Garner succeeds in repairing the FTL drive but dies in the process. Apollo jumps the Pegasus back to safety and is rewarded by his father by being promoted and appointed Commander of the Pegasus. Back on Galactica, President Roslin issues an executive decree banning abortion but not before allowing the Gemenese girl to terminate her pregnancy and granting her asylum, thereby infuriating the Gemenese representative. During a press conference, Vice President Baltar publicly denounces Roslin's decision and announces his candidacy in the upcoming elections.

The player controls the title character Scooby-Doo. The primary goal of the game is to hunt for the gang after they go missing at the mysterious Mystic Manor. Scooby has several abilities in the game as well as many inventions he finds on the grounds of the mansion to aid him in his search. original show. The game's combat system allows the player to run, jump, and perform attacks to fend off enemies that are encountered. Various villains from the original Scooby Doo! show are met throughout the game, as well as other minor villains like bats, rats, spiders, and crabs. Scooby's health bar goes down when a villain or enemy scares Scooby, and it can only be restored by various food items that can be obtained throughout the game. Whenever Scooby is scared by a villain, if he bashes and kills the villain instantly afterwards, a food item will be provided on the spot to get his health level back up. Easter eggs that players can obtain, called \\"Monster Tokens\\", are large collectible tokens that have a picture of a Scooby-Doo! villain on them; when the player collects the token, the villain will be able to be viewed in a room in Mystic Manor known as the Monster Gallery, where trivia about the villain is given.

There are \\"warp gates\\", which, when activated, are machines that teleport Scooby to other activated warp gates throughout the game. The boss fights consist of major Scooby-Doo! villains, such as Redbeard or the Black Knight. Various secret passages and trap doors, which act as shortcuts, are scattered throughout the game. Outside levels also have various obstacles, such as moving platforms and mud-slides. Scooby must also collect Scooby Snacks scattered throughout the game in order to open \\"Snack Gates\\" that open many of the game's doors; as the game progresses, the Snack Gates demand more Scooby Snacks. Although it is optional to collect all of the snacks, bonus content is unlocked if the player does so. The voice acting is complemented by sound effects taken straight from the cartoon, including a laugh track that reacts to Scooby's onscreen actions.

For instance, on Christmas, it will be snowing, and on Halloween bats appear above the doors and windows. New Year's Day, Saint Patrick's Day, Valentine's Day, and the Fourth of July are other holidays that have special surprises as well. Synopsis=Setting In a recreation of the classic Scooby-Doo formula, a ghost/monster is terrorizing the locals of a town, with Scooby and the gang called to solve a mystery. An eccentric villain known as The Mastermind kidnaps the gang, and Scooby must venture through graveyards, lighthouses, and secret passages in an effort to solve the mystery and find his friends. The game is mainly set inside a large mansion known as Mystic Manor. The manor has dozens of rooms and floors, from the secret laboratory in the basement to the haunted attic. The game is set during the late hours of the night. Outside of the Manor, players can explore the vast graveyard section as well as the sea pier section. Each section has its own settings, such as fishing canneries and haunted crypts. Plot Daphne's close friend, Holly Graham, has asked the Mystery Inc. crew to help her investigate the disappearance of her uncle, Professor Alexander Graham, a genius and inventor. The five arrive at the mansion, known as Mystic Manor, where they are greeted by Holly; she recounts how Daphne has told her about their past cases before inviting the group to come inside, but Scooby and Shaggy refuse. Fred, Daphne, and Velma follow Holly inside, leaving Shaggy and Scooby outside alone. When Shaggy goes to obtain a box of Scooby Snacks he notices hanging from a gnarled tree, he pulls on one of the branches and falls into a trap door. Frightened, Scooby explores the grounds and discovers a nearby playground where he collects a monster token, receives some clues for the mystery, and eats all of the Scooby snacks. He then enters the mansion and discovers Holly locked in a room. She explains that a specter called The Mastermind appeared, kidnapping Fred, Daphne, and Velma before imprisoning her, and gives him a map of the region for getting around. Unable to navigate the rest of the mansion, Scooby returns to the front yard where he speaks with Graham's gardener (Don Knotts), who gives him a shovel. The shovel allows him to obtain a key to the nearby fishing village. Between the Fishing Village and the docks to the ocean, Scooby encounters Shaggy once again, who assists him with unlocking an entrance to the piers of the village before, again, vanishing without a trace. Soon Scooby comes to an old lighthouse, where he acquires one of Graham's inventions: a pair of springs, which allow him to double jump. Scooby uses this ability to obtain a key to the mansion's topiary garden. The Mastermind, voiced by Tim Curry. Scooby makes his way back to the mansion grounds. He navigates the topiary garden, where he obtains one of the professor's inventions: a helmet, allowing him to destroy attacking monsters and bash through cobwebs. Scooby explores the mansion, making his way through numerous rooms, the library, and the attic, before arriving at the top of a tower. He meets The Mastermind, who reveals that he is responsible for resurrecting the monsters and ghosts the group has unmasked, before revealing Velma trapped in a cage, which is guarded by the Black Knight, the first monster Scooby ever encountered. Scooby is able to destroy him by pressing switches which electrocute him, before freeing Velma from her cage. She flees in terror, claiming to see the Creeper. Scooby does not follow her as he does not see the Creeper anywhere in sight. Following this, Scooby explores a local cannery, along with the overhangs and some interconnected tunnels under the mansion, which lead him to a nearby cemetery. He rescues Shaggy from some monsters, before discovering Daphne held hostage by The Mastermind. The Mastermind proceeds to summon the Green Ghost, which attacks Scooby with green fire and electricity. Scooby is able to contain the Green Ghost with Daphne's help. Suddenly, Holly emerges from the brush. She and Daphne fall through a concealed door when Daphne rests against a tombstone, leaving Scooby alone once again. He uses a newly acquired invention, an umbrella, to explore a chain of old shipwrecks. Eventually, Scooby discovers Fred imprisoned in one of the ship's brigs, where he is confronted by The Ghost of Redbeard. He attacks Scooby by summoning numerous ghosts, but Scooby is able to smash him by dropping a treasure chest on his head. Velma arrives, still claiming to be chased by the Creeper. Fred discovers an image of the monster stamped on her glasses, and they head off to search for Graham's concealed laboratory. Meanwhile, Scooby and Shaggy indulge themselves with food, but Shaggy is scared off by The Ghost of Captain Cutler. Scooby acquires another of Graham's inventions: bubblegum, which he uses to trap monsters from being able to attack him. Scooby makes his way back to the overhangs, where he begins navigating the dungeons under the mansion. He encounters numerous ghosts, which he is able to destroy and avoid using his newly acquired inventions: air-bubbles. Scooby eventually discovers Professor Graham's laboratory, which has become overrun with monsters, namely the Funland Robot and the Space Kook. Scooby rescues Shaggy from being eaten by a shark, before continuing onward into another room, where he reunites with the rest of the gang and Holly. Fred reveals that the ghosts are entirely fake: The Mastermind has been using holographic images of monsters and ghosts from their past to terrorize them. He constructs a plan, which calls for Scooby to distract The Mastermind. Scooby fights and defeats The Mastermind, stunning him. He is sucked up through a tube which spits him out in the mansion's parlor. The gang and Holly make their way back to the first floor of the mansion. They unmask The Mastermind, only to discover Professor Graham in the costume. Velma argues that none of the clues make sense, before holding her glasses up to a mirror. The light reflected off the glasses and mirror reveal Holly operating a control panel behind a holographic wall. They realize the Holly they have been with the entire time has been a hologram when Shaggy attempts to touch her shoulder, but instead falls through her. Holly was able to escape the mansion and swap costumes with an incapacitated Professor Graham, making him look guilty. She was able to reconstruct images of the monsters, due to Daphne previously revealing details about the cases the gang had worked in the past. Holly admits to the scheme as a way of enabling her to take commendation for Graham's new invention and make money off of it, before she is sent to jail. Shaggy attempts to eat some food, only to discover it is a holographic image made by Scooby before saying \\"Scooby-Dooby-Doo!\\"  Development and release  Initially planned for a June 2002 release, the game was released on May 22, 2002 initially for the PlayStation 2 (just prior to E3 2002), before being ported to other platforms later.

Davis received his bachelor's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1969, his Ph.D from Princeton University in 1973 and has been elected to both the National Academy of Sciences (1991) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1992). Davis taught for a year at Princeton, 1973‚Äì74, then served on the Astronomy faculty at Harvard from 1975 to 1981. Since 1981 he has been on the faculty of the Department of Astronomy and Physics at the University of California at Berkeley. Davis' work has been in physical cosmology and he has done a number of significant projects. While at Harvard, Davis led the CfA (Harvard- Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) galaxy survey, the first redshift survey of galaxies, which motivated his interest in N-body simulations of the Universe. In the 1980s, Davis, now at Berkeley, was part of a collaboration‚Äîwith George Efstathiou, Carlos Frenk, and Simon White‚Äîthat established the validity of the \\"cold dark matter\\" theory for the formation of galaxies and other cosmic structures, now the accepted interpretation in cosmology. In a classic series of papers, that collaboration‚Äîoften called DEFW by their peers‚Äîused computer code to simulate the growth of the universe and resolve disputes among theoretical models. Through the 90's Davis worked on the theoretically expected large scale flow of galaxies and led the redshift survey of the first all-sky catalog, IRAS, with which he was able to estimate the flow of galaxies out to redshifts of order 6000 km/s. He took up this project once again in 2010 using the gravity field estimated from 2MASS, and he and Nusser were able to estimate the field to redshift of order 10,000 km/s. He was the lead principal investigator on the ambitious DEEP2 Redshift Survey of 50,000 high redshift galaxies. This was conducted on the ten-meter W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The scientific goals of the DEEP survey were to study the properties of galaxies and the clustering of galaxies as the universe has evolved. He has also helped organize and run an all-sky model of cosmic dust distribution in the Milky Way galaxy. Davis was awarded an honorary PhD from the University of Chicago in 2008. He has also been named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Physical Society, and he has received the Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics from the American Institute of Physics and the American Astronomical Society, as well as the Gruber Prize in Cosmology in 2011, among numerous other prizes and awards. While working on the DEEP survey, Davis suffered a stroke in June 2003; it has affected his right limbs although he continues to enjoy one of the main passions in his life, skiing.

It aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on February 24, 2006. The episode takes place alongside the rest of the re-imagined series, with 49,579 human survivors left in the Fleet. The episode primarily details the lives of two specific Cylon models after their apparent destruction who were declared Cylon heroes. One model is \\"Caprica- Six\\", the copy of Number Six who was responsible for disabling the Colonial defense system prior to the events of the miniseries. The other model is Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii, a sleeper agent who was a member of the crew of Galactica. The concept of a Cylon-centric episode was proposed long before the episode aired, in an episode which would have seen the Cylons discuss their equivalent of the \\"Final Solution\\". \\"Downloaded\\" instead focuses on showing the personality of the Cylon race, in particular, Caprica-Six and Boomer. The episode was universally well-received despite its unconventional format. Plot The episode primarily takes place on Cylon-occupied Caprica. After the Fall of the Twelve Colonies, the copy of Number Six (Tricia Helfer) that was responsible for disabling the Colonial defense system (affectionately known as \\"Caprica-Six\\") and Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii (Grace Park), after being shot by Specialist Cally (\\"Resistance\\") were both \\"downloaded\\": a standard Cylon practice of rebirth which takes place if a model is to perish, and have both been hailed as Cylon heroes due to their efforts in infiltrating human society. Both are having difficulties in adjusting to life on Caprica. In particular, Caprica-Six is having visions of Gaius Baltar (James Callis) that only she can see, much like Baltar's visions of Caprica-Six, and Boomer is having problems accepting her Cylon nature to the point of the denial, even in danger of being \\"boxed\\", which means storing a Cylon's memories without consciousness out of its body. Number Three (Lucy Lawless) asks Caprica-Six to help Boomer in this regard. However, when Caprica-Six starts to associate more with Boomer, they both realize that the holocaust the Cylons effected was a sin. They also come to the conclusion that due to their unique perspectives, Number Three is searching for a reason to box them both. Caprica-Six and Boomer are next shown conversing with Number Three. While the three move up a stairwell, explosives set by the resistance led by Samuel T. Anders (Michael Trucco) detonate, trapping Anders, Three, Boomer, and Caprica-Six in a parking garage. While Anders is originally shielded and hidden by the blast, Caprica- Six breaks her leg. Number Three offers to euthanize her, but Caprica-Six refuses as she suspects that Number Three will take the opportunity to box her. Shortly afterwards, the three find Anders who Number Three intends to kill before being stopped by Boomer and Caprica-Six. As Number Three goads them, Boomer and Caprica-Six understand that their unique view of humanity through their love for Baltar and Galen Tyrol gives them a perspective that makes them a threat to the Cylon status-quo. When Number Three attempts to kill Anders, she is killed by Caprica-Six who, along with Boomer, allow Anders to escape. Recognizing that it will take some time for Number Three to resurrect and report them, Caprica-Six and Boomer form a pact to change the Cylon perspective of humanity together before finally being rescued from the collapsed parking garage by the other Cylons. The episode's secondary plot takes place on Galactica. The copy of Number Eight that defected from the Cylons gives birth by cesarian section to a baby who she and Karl Agathon (Tahmoh Penikett) call \\"Hera\\". However, President Laura Roslin, and her secretary, Tory Foster, and Dr. Cottle conspire to fake Hera's death fearing what would happen if the Cylons knew the child lived. President Roslin also did not want Hera to be raised by her Cylon mother, Sharon, whom she still does not trust. At the end of the episode, the child is given to a woman who believes the child was born on Pegasus, while Helo and Chief Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) scatter the ashes they believe to be Hera's into space. Production The concept of a Cylon-perspective episode was originally proposed for an episode called \\"The Raid\\", which would have consisted on a Cylon meeting not unlike the Wannsee Conference, but was dropped as the equivalent \\"final solution\\" had already happened during the miniseries. Nevertheless, Sci-Fi liked the concept, and commissioned this episode. A major theme of the episode is the humanization of \\"Caprica-Six\\" - while Caprica-Six shows her manipulative streak in parts of the episode, in particular during her conversation in the beach-side house with Boomer, the destruction of the Twelve Colonies and her love of Baltar have somewhat changed her psychology. Conversely, Boomer shows resistance to her Cylon nature. Series creator Ronald D. Moore found the scene that took place in Boomer's apartment interesting as it showed a major amount of her backstory. It also serves the purpose of Boomer's denial that her memories were manufactured, and that the Cylons are more passive than humans. Another major subplot is the \\"Virtual Baltar\\" only visible by Caprica-Six, which Moore commented was a \\"delicious symmetry\\" to Baltar's \\"Virtual Six\\". Both were intended to show how the couple had been changed through experience, in particular, the events of the miniseries. Several scenes were cut from the episode. Of these, the most notable is an entire subplot centering on Gina and D'Anna kidnapping Hera Agathon, which was excised as Moore felt there would be \\"too many Cylons\\". The production team also had significant problems with the scenes in the parking garage, and how to avoid the anatopism of contemporary cars being found on Caprica. In order to avoid this, the production team used cars mostly found in Eastern Europe, for the purpose that the audience would not immediately recognise the types of cars, but still to keep a sense of realism. Reception Ronald D. Moore stated that \\"Downloaded\\" is his favorite episode of the series, and especially admired the acting of Park, Helfer, and Callis, the latter especially for his change in role. Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity gave the episode an \\"A+\\" rating. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad commented that the episode was \\"perfect\\", and made up for any issues he had about the show before the episode. He found the storyline concerning the birth of Hera Agathon, the hybrid baby, a \\"clever twist\\", and appreciated the episode's general Cylon perspective. The Chicago Tribune appreciated Park, Helfer, and Lawless' acting and the appearance of Dr. Cottle, and concluded by saying that it was well- crafted and added to the \\"deftly drawn moral confusion\\" over whether the Cylons were good or evil. The episode was nominated by the World Science Fiction Society for the 2007 Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, an award that was won by the Doctor Who episode \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\".

Located at 2540 N. Lincoln Ave., the Apollo has 440 seats and a lobby featuring art exhibits and a full bar. The venue is currently temporarily closed due to COVID-19, however it is planning to reopen on June 7 2020 with the musical Be More Chill. The theatre is also the home of the Emerald City Theatre Company. The Apollo Theater Chicago has no relation to the Apollo Theater in New York City. History Apollo Theater Chicago comfortably seats 440 guests The Apollo Theater Chicago is not the first Chicago theater to bear the name Apollo. In 1921, theatrical producer A. H. Woods opened the Apollo Theatre in the Chicago Loop District, at the corner of Randolph and Dearborn Streets. Originally operated as a playhouse, the old Apollo Theatre was sold in 1927 to United Artists Corporation and was renamed the United Artists Theatre. It was demolished in 1989. In 1991 Michael Leavitt and Fox Theatricals took ownership of the venue, then in 1996 until present Rob Kolsen took over. In 2005 a smaller 50 seat second stage was built, in what was formerly the Act One Bookstore. The smaller venue is popular for comedy, sketch shows, and improv theater.  Previous Productions  Notable productions at the new Apollo include David Mamet's Sexual Perversity in Chicago starring James Belushi, Balm in Gilead with John Malkovich and Gary Sinise, the long running play The Vagina Monologues, and A Nutcracker Christmas written by children's recording artist Ralph Covert of Ralph's World and G. Riley Mills. From October 1 2008 to January 17 2016 The Musical Million Dollar Quartet played at the venue, making it the longest running Broadway musical in Chicago.

Life Born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and raised in Petit-Go√¢ve, Laferri√®re worked as a journalist in Haiti before moving to Canada in 1976.Brian Busby, \\"Dany Laferri√®re\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia, November 16, 2009. He also worked as a journalist in Canada, and hosted television programming for the TQS network. Laferri√®re published his first novel, How to Make Love to a Negro Without Getting Tired (Comment faire l'amour avec un n√®gre sans se fatiguer) in 1985. The novel was later adapted into a screenplay by Laferri√®re and Richard Sadler, earning a Genie Award nomination for best adapted screenplay at the 11th Genie Awards in 1990. The film adaptation of the novel starred Isaach De Bankol√© and was directed by Jacques W. Benoit. Laferri√®re writes exclusively in French, although some of his works have been published in English translation by David Homel. Several further films have been adapted from his work, including On the Verge of a Fever (Le Go√ªt des jeunes filles) in 2004 and Heading South (Vers le sud) in 2005. He also wrote the original screenplays for Voodoo Taxi in 1991 and How to Conquer America in One Night (Comment conqu√©rir l'Am√©rique en une nuit) in 2004, and was the director of the latter. In 2009, Laferri√®re won the prestigious Prix M√©dicis for his 11th novel, L'√©nigme du retour. Upon receiving the prize, he commented on its ability to open up a new readership in France, giving him visibility there. In the past Laferri√®re had always refused to be published in the fall, a season associated with the great literary prizes, but had been recommended to do so with L'√©nigme du retour by his editors. The novel follows Laferri√®re as he returns to his birthplace in Haiti, 33 years after he left it, upon learning of his father's death in New York City. The narrative blurs the line between prose and poetry, resembling haiku structures in some sections. On 12 December 2013, Laferri√®re was elected on the first round of balloting to Seat no. 2 of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, becoming the first Haitian, the first Canadian and the first Quebecer to receive that honour. He is the second black person to have been inducted, the first being Senegalese writer and statesman L√©opold S√©dar Senghor in 1983. On 3 June 2014, he was awarded the International Literature Award by the House of World Cultures for his novel The Return (L'enigme du retour). In 2014, he was appointed officer of the National Order of Quebec. In 2015, Laferri√®re was awarded the Order of Canada with the grade of officer.

It is a yellow volatile solid that melts near room temperature. Samples are typically black due to impurities. The analogous OsO4 is more widely used and better known. One of the few solvents in which RuO4 forms stable solutions is CCl4.  Preparation  RuO4 is prepared by oxidation of ruthenium(III) chloride with NaIO4. :8 Ru3+(aq) + 5 IO4‚àí(aq) + 12 H2O(l) -> 8 RuO4(s) + 5 I‚àí(aq) + 24 H+(aq) Due to the expense, toxicity, and high reactivity of RuO4, it is often generated in situ and used in catalytic quantities in organic reactions, by using a substoichiometric amount of ruthenium(III) or -(IV) precursor and a stoichiometric amount of sodium metaperiodate as the terminal oxidant to continuously regenerate small amounts of RuO4. In typical reactions featuring RuO4 as the oxidant, many forms of ruthenium usefully serve as precursors to RuO4, most commonly used are RuCl3¬∑xH2O or RuO2¬∑xH2O.  Structure  RuO4 forms two crystal structures, one with cubic symmetry and another with monoclinic symmetry, isotypic to OsO4. The molecule adopts a tetrahedral geometry, with the Ru‚ÄìO distances ranging from 169 to 170 pm. Uses=Isolation of ruthenium from ores The main commercial value of RuO4 is as an intermediate in the production of ruthenium compounds and metal from ores. Like other platinum group metals (PGMs), ruthenium occurs at low concentrations and often mixed with other PGMs. Together with OsO4, it is separated from other PGMs by distillation of a chlorine-oxidized extract. Ruthenium is separated from OsO4 by reducing RuO4 with hydrochloric acid, a process that exploits the highly positive reduction potential for the [RuO4]0/- couple. Organic chemistry RuO4 is of specialized value in organic chemistry because it oxidizes virtually any hydrocarbon. For example, it will oxidize adamantane to 1-adamantanol. Because it is such an aggressive oxidant, reaction conditions must be mild, generally room temperature. Although a strong oxidant, RuO4 oxidations do not perturb stereocenters that are not oxidized. Illustrative is the oxidation of the following diol to a carboxylic acid: :450px Oxidation of epoxy alcohols also occurs without degradation of the epoxide ring: :450px Under milder conditions, oxidative reaction yields aldehydes instead. RuO4 readily converts secondary alcohols into ketones. Although similar results can be achieved with other cheaper oxidants such as PCC- or DMSO-based oxidants, RuO4 is ideal when a very vigorous oxidant is needed, but mild conditions must be maintained. It is used in organic synthesis to oxidize internal alkynes to 1,2-diketones, and terminal alkynes along with primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. When used in this fashion, the ruthenium(VIII) oxide is used in catalytic amounts and regenerated by the addition of sodium periodate to ruthenium(III) chloride and a solvent mixture of acetonitrile, water and carbon tetrachloride. RuO4 readily cleaves double bonds to yield carbonyl products, in a manner similar to ozonolysis. OsO4, a more familiar oxidant that is structurally similar to RuO4, does not cleave double bonds, instead producing vicinal diol products. However, with short reaction times and carefully controlled conditions, RuO4 can also be used for dihydroxylation. Because RuO4 degrades the \\"double bonds\\" of arenes (especially electron-rich ones) by dihydroxylation and cleavage of the C-C bond in a way few other reagents can, it is useful as a \\"deprotection\\" reagent for carboxylic acids that are masked as aryl groups (typically phenyl or p-methoxyphenyl). Because the fragments formed are themselves readily oxidizable by RuO4, a substantial fraction of the arene carbon atoms undergo exhaustive oxidation to form carbon dioxide. Consequently, multiple equivalents of the terminal oxidant (often in excess of 10 equivalents per aryl ring) are required to achieve complete conversion to the carboxylic acid, limiting the practicality of the transformation. 500x500px Although used as a direct oxidant, due to the relatively high cost of RuO4 it is also used catalytically with a cooxidant. For an oxidation of cyclic alcohols with RuO4 as a catalyst and bromate as oxidant under basic conditions, RuO4 is first activated by hydroxide: :RuO4 \\\\+ OH‚àí ‚Üí HRuO5‚àí The reaction proceeds via a glycolate complex. Other uses Ruthenium tetroxide is a potential staining agent. It is used to expose latent fingerprints by turning to the brown/black ruthenium dioxide when in contact with fatty oils or fats contained in sebaceous contaminants of the print.

Hesiod's first (after Chaos) are Gaia, Tartarus, Eros, Erebus, Hemera and Nyx. The primordial deities Gaia and Uranus give birth to the Titans, and the Cyclopes. The Titans Cronus and Rhea give birth to Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, Hera and Demeter who overthrew the Titans. The warring of the gods ends with the reign of Zeus. Hesiod's primordial genealogy Hesiod's Theogony (c. 700 BC) tells the story of the genesis of the gods. After invoking the Muses (II.1‚Äì116), he tells of the generation of the first four primordial deities: > \\"First Chaos came to be, but next... Earth... and dim Tartarus in the depth > of the... Earth, and Eros...\\" According to Hesiod, the next primordial gods that come to be are: * Darkness and Night (born of Chaos); * Light and Day (born of Night and Darkness); * Heaven and Ocean (virginally born of Earth)  First generation  * Chaos (Void) * Gaia (Earth) * Uranus (Sky) * Ourea (Mountains) * Pontus (Sea) * Tartarus (Underworld) * Erebus (Darkness) * Nyx (Night) * Aether (Light) * Hemera (Day) * Eros (Love) (in later myths, the name of Aphrodite and Ares' son) Other sources * Achlys (Misery) * Ananke (Compulsion) * Chronos (Time) * Phanes (Procreation) (hermaphrodite) * Aion (Eternity) * Nesoi (Islands) * Thalassa (Sea) * Moirai (Fate) * Moros (Doom)  Chaos  In some variations of Hesiod's creation myth, in Greek mythology, Chaos is the first being to ever exist. Chaos is both seen as a deity and a thing, with some sources seeing chaos as the gap between Heaven and Earth. In some accounts Chaos existed first alongside Eros and Nyx, while in others Chaos is the first and only thing in the universe. In some stories, Chaos is seen as existing beneath Tartarus. Chaos is the parent to Night and Darkness.  Gaia  Gaia was one of the first beings to be formed from Chaos in Hesiod's theogony, and parthenogenetically gave birth to Heaven, who would later become her husband and her equal, the Sea, and to the high Mountains. Gaia is a mother earth figure and is seen as the mother of all the gods, while also being the seat on which they exist. Gaia is the Greek Equivalent to the Roman goddess, Tellus / Terra. The story of Uranus' castration at the hands of Cronus due to Gaia's involvement is seen as the explanation for why Heaven and Earth are separated. In Hesiod's story, Earth seeks revenge against Heaven for hiding her children the Cyclopes deep within her, Gaia then goes to her other children and asks for their help to get revenge against their cruel father; of her children, only Cronus, the youngest and \\"most dreadful\\" of them all agrees to do this. Gaia plans an ambush against Uranus where she hides Cronus and gives him the sickle to castrate him. From the blood Gaia again become pregnant with the Furies, the Giants, and the Melian nymphs. Cronus goes on to have six children with his sister, Rhea; who become the Olympians. Cronus is later overthrown by his son, Zeus, much in the same way he overthrew his father. Gaia is the mother to the twelve Titans; Okeanus, Kois, Kreios, Hyperion, Iapetos, Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoibe, Tethys, and Cronus. Later in the myth, after his succession, Cronus learns from his mother and father that his own son (Zeus) will overthrow him, as he did Uranus. To prevent this, Cronus swallowed all of his children with his sister Rhea as soon as they were born. Rhea sought out Gaia for help in hiding her youngest son, Zeus, and gave Cronus a rock instead to swallow. Zeus later went on to defeat his father and become the leader of the Olympians. After Zeus's succession to the throne, Gaia bore another son with Tartarus, Typhon, a monster who would be the last to challenge Zeus's authority. Heaven and Earth have three sets of children * The Titans * The Cyclopes * Cottus, Briareos, Gyes  Nyx  Nyx (Night) is the mother of the Moirai (The Fates) and many other offspring. In some variations of Hesiod's Theogony, Nyx is told as having black wings; and in one tale she laid an egg in Erebus from which Love sprang out. With Erebus (Darkness) she has Aether and Hemera, both embodying the antithesis of their parents. However, the children Nyx has through parthenogenesis reflect the dark aspects of the goddess. One version of Hesiod's tale tells that Night shares her house with Day in Tartarus, but that the two are never home at the same time. However, in some versions Nyx's home is where Chaos and Tartarus meet, suggesting to the idea that Chaos resides beneath Tartarus.  Children of Nyx  The three fates are: * Clotho * Lachesis * Atropos Other offspring of Nyx through parthenogenesis include: * Hypnos (Sleep) * Mockery and Woe * The Hesperides * Thanatos (Death) * Nemesis * Eris (Strife)  Eros  Eros is the god of love in Greek mythology, and in some versions of Greek mythology, is one of the primordial beings that first came from Chaos. In Hesiod's version, Eros was the \\"fairest among the immortal gods ... who conquers the mind and sensible thoughts of all gods and men.\\"  Tartarus  Tartarus is described by Hesiod as both a primordial deity and also a great abyss where the Titans are imprisoned. Tartarus is seen as a prison, but is also where Day, Night, Sleep, and Death dwell, and also imagined as a great gorge that's a distinct part of the underworld. Hesiod tells that it took ten days for the Titans to fall to the bottom of Tartarus, describing how deep the abyss is. In some versions Tartarus is described as a \\"misty darkness\\" where Death, Styx, and Erebus reside. Non-Hesiodic theogonies  The ancient Greeks entertained different versions of the origin of primordial deities. Some of these stories were possibly inherited from the pre-Greek Aegean cultures. Homeric primordial theogony The Iliad, an epic poem attributed to Homer about the Trojan War (an oral tradition of 700‚Äì600 BCE), states that Oceanus (and possibly Tethys, too) is the parent of all the deities.  Other Greek theogonies  * Alcman (fl. 7th century BCE) called the water-nymph Thetis the first goddess, producing poros (path), tekmor (marker), and skotos (darkness) on the pathless, featureless void. * Orphic poetry ( 530 BCE) made Nyx the first principle, Night, and her offspring were many. Also, in the Orphic tradition, Phanes (a mystic Orphic deity of light and procreation, sometimes identified with the Elder Eros) is the original ruler of the universe, who hatched from the cosmic egg. * Aristophanes ( 446‚Äì386 BCE) wrote in his play The Birds that Nyx was the first deity also, and that she produced Eros from an egg.  Philosophical theogonies  Philosophers of Classical Greece also constructed their own metaphysical cosmogonies, with their own primordial deities: * Pherecydes of Syros ( 600‚Äì550 BCE) made Chronos (time) the first deity in his Heptamychia. * Empedocles ( 490‚Äì430 BCE) wrote that Philotes (\\"Love\\") and Neikos (\\"Hate\\") were the first principles, who wove the universe out of the four elements with their powers of love and strife. * Plato ( 428‚Äì347 BCE) introduced (in Timaeus) the concept of the demiurge, who had modeled the universe on the Ideas.  Interpretation of primordial deities  Scholars dispute the meaning of the primordial deities in the poems of Homer and Hesiod. Since the primordials give birth to the Titans, and the Titans give birth to the Olympians, one way of interpreting the primordial gods is as the deepest and most fundamental nature of the cosmos. For example, Jenny Strauss Clay argues that Homer's poetic vision centers on the reign of Zeus, but that Hesiod's vision of the primordials put Zeus and the Olympians in context. Likewise, Vernant argues that the Olympic pantheon is a \\"system of classification, a particular way of ordering and conceptualizing the universe by distinguishing within it various types of powers and forces.\\" But even before the Olympic pantheon were the Titans and primordial gods. Homer alludes to a more tumultuous past before Zeus was the undisputed King and Father. Mitchell Miller argues that the first four primordial deities arise in a highly significant relationship. He argues that Chaos represents differentiation, since Chaos differentiates (separates, divides) Tartarus and Earth. Even though Chaos is \\"first of all\\" for Hesiod, Miller argues that Tartarus represents the primacy of the undifferentiated, or the unlimited. Since undifferentiation is unthinkable, Chaos is the \\"first of all\\" in that he is the first thinkable being.

It is located 1 mile north of Middle Country Road (Route 25) on Marshall Drive. History and overview As suburban growth spread into central Suffolk county in the 1950s, the new Middle Country Central School District was created in 1957 from the merger of the Selden and Centereach school districts. Newfield opened in 1959 to serve the growing population, as neither district had ever had a high school. Before its opening, upper level students had been sent to Port Jefferson High School. Newfield's name is derived from the former names of both Centereach (which adjoins Selden and is part of the same school district) and Selden; New Village and Westfield. It has always served as secondary school, currently educating students from the 9th through 12th grade. In the past, students from the 9th grade were educated at Selden Junior High School, and this changed when the Junior High formally became Selden Middle School and the 9th grade was passed on to Newfield. Athletics Newfield fields a number of varsity and junior varsity athletic teams, in Section 11, Division 1 of the New York State Public High School Athletic Association, including Baseball, Basketball, Bowling, Cheerleading, Cross Country, Fencing, Field Hockey, Football, Golf, Gymnastics, Lacrosse, Soccer, Softball, Tennis, Track & Field, Volleyball (Girls), and Wrestling. Although team uniforms use the school's red and white colors, in the late 1990s, varsity teams began using black as a third color to distinguish from junior varsity.

Part 1 aired originally on the Sci Fi Channel on March 3, 2006; Part 2 aired on March 10, 2006 as a 90-minute special.  Plot = Part 1  Captain Starbuck is green-lit to lead a group of 20 Raptors back to Caprica to rescue the human resistance led by Samuel Anders. The team utilizes a captured Cylon navigation device wired into the Cylon prisoner Sharon Agathon, to increase the Raptors' jump range allowing them to get back to Caprica in only ten jumps. On the first jump however, they lose track of a Raptor piloted by Racetrack, whose mis-jump causes her to arrive inside a nebula. Debating with her ECO whether or not to try to catch up with the others, they stumble across a planet hidden in the nebula that, although somewhat harsh, can support human life. Vice President Gaius Baltar finds himself behind in the polls with two weeks remaining until the presidential election. Once Racetrack returns with data on the new planet, Tom Zarek realizes that it provides a crucial election issue: an opportunity for permanent colonization. He convinces Baltar to push the idea in his campaign, believing that people cooped up in the fleet for nine months will support it overwhelmingly. President Laura Roslin suspects that the Cylons may already know of the hidden world and that their stay should only be long enough to gather fresh water and to grow food supplies. In Galactica's hangar, Chief Galen Tyrol is found after sleepwalking, restlessly asleep on the deck by Specialist Cally. He snaps and violently assaults her after she wakes him. He later seeks religious counseling from a priest named Brother Cavil. Tyrol explains his dreams of jumping off a hangar bay catwalk to his death. Cavil believes it is Tyrol's subconscious desire to kill himself manifested from a fear that he too could be a Cylon \\"sleeper agent\\" like Boomer. When Tyrol asks how Brother Cavil can be so certain he is actually human, Cavil sarcastically reassures him that he is not a Cylon \\"because I'm a Cylon and I've never seen you at any of the meetings\\" and that Tyrol should return to his duties without worry. On Caprica, Starbuck's rescue team arrives and locates the survivors including their leader Samuel Anders. Their resistance force has been reduced to no more than sixty. The survivors inform their rescuers that they are being pursued by Cylons and they come under immediate attack.  Part 2  After an 18-hour standoff on Caprica with the Cylons, Starbuck's rescue team finds that their enemy has completely withdrawn. At the fleet, Cally is recovering from her beating by Chief Tyrol. Tyrol apologizes to Cally who forgives him and reveals that she has feelings for him. Roslin secretly meets with Baltar and asks that he table his idea for settling the planet he calls \\"New Caprica\\" until after the election. Baltar refuses, to Roslin's dismay. She then confronts him about seeing him on Caprica with the blonde Cylon woman, recalling her deathbed vision. Though visibly shaken by Laura's accusation, Baltar knows she has no proof and deflects her questioning. When Starbuck's rescue team returns to Galactica, an alarmed Chief Tyrol notices a copy of Brother Cavil among the rescued Caprican survivors and alerts security. The man admits to being a Cylon and is taken to the brig along with Sharon Agathon, who knew Cavil was a Cylon agent and didn't warn them. Sharon later explains to Helo that she didn't warn them because she believes Adama killed her baby and that she no longer cares what happens to her. Kara and Sam Anders get reacquainted in a bunk room. Commander Lee Adama (Apollo) enters to introduce himself to Anders, but a drunken Thrace barely acknowledges Adama's presence and makes crude remarks about his new relationship with Petty Officer Dualla. Roslin meets with the Cylon man who is joined in the brig by his sarcastic twin, Brother Cavil. The Cylon man brings the message that two Cylon \\"heroes\\" (a Number Six and Number Eight who they identify as the resurrected Boomer), have convinced the rest of the Cylons that the attack on the Colonies, along with the pursuit of the fleet, were errors. They state that the Cylons need to find their own unique path to enlightenment and have decided to offer humanity a \\"reprieve\\". Roslin and Adama are skeptical and Roslin orders they be vented into space. On election day, Baltar has a 5,000 vote lead over Roslin until the final batch of votes from the Zephyr are counted. Roslin wins the election against all predictions. Lt. Gaeta, who was in charge of the ballot counting, spots a major irregularity with the Zephyr's ballot papers and reports the matter to Col. Tigh. The truth is that Tigh himself, in collusion with Dualla and Tory Foster (Roslin's campaign assistant), has rigged the election in favor of Roslin. Gaeta takes the matter directly to Admiral Adama. Adama confronts Roslin who admits she knew that Foster was planning to rig the vote. She stresses that Baltar cannot become President because he is working for the Cylons, explaining to Adama what she saw back on Caprica. He is shocked at her claims and though he has no wish to see Baltar as President he insists the vote rigging was illegal and would eventually weigh heavily on her conscience. Roslin reluctantly cedes the victory to Baltar. Adama explains to Baltar that the original vote count was a \\"tabulating error\\". Baltar knows this isn't true but decides to let the matter rest and orders Adama to take the fleet to New Caprica. Baltar later meets with Gina and tells her they can live together at the new settlement, but she says she isn't going. Baltar goes to Colonial One to be sworn in as President. Gina sets off the nuclear warhead that Baltar gave her terrorist group. The detonation destroys Cloud Nine and several other ships caught within the blast radius. Despite the threat of a new Cylon attack, Baltar insists that plans to settle on New Caprica move forward. The next scene opens 380 days later, when the people of the fleet have settled \\"New Caprica City\\". Above New Caprica, the remaining larger ships orbit with only skeleton crews. These include Galactica where Admiral Adama is now assisted by Helo, and Pegasus, where Commander Apollo is now assisted by Dualla. The battlestars are no longer being maintained in combat-ready condition. President Baltar has turned Colonial One into a messy bachelor pad. Gaeta works diligently as his aide, though Baltar largely ignores him. Laura Roslin has returned to teaching and works inside a makeshift school assisted by Maya. Tyrol is now the leader of a disgruntled worker union denouncing the deplorable conditions the people face under President Baltar. At his side is a pregnant Cally. Sam Anders, now married to Kara, is currently bedridden with pneumonia. Dr. Cottle has no more antibiotics left to give him, but Tigh tells Kara that Commander Adama has antibiotics stored away as a medical reserve on Pegasus for his pilots. Kara reluctantly calls Lee, but neither seems to wish to talk to the other. Before Lee can respond to Kara's request, a fleet of Cylon ships suddenly jumps in. Admiral Adama is reluctant to abandon those on New Caprica but Apollo, knowing that they are outmatched, convinces him to jump away, leaving New Caprica undefended. Gaeta rushes to inform President Baltar that the Cylons have appeared and that the fleet has jumped away. The Cylons fly over New Caprica in force and proceed to occupy the human settlement. The Cylon Leoben Conoy searches for Thrace but finds only the bedridden Anders. President Baltar meets with the Cylons who insist they will not attack unless the humans resist. They explain that New Caprica was found by accident when they detected, from over a light-year away, the signature of the nuclear explosion which destroyed Cloud Nine. With no other option, President Baltar surrenders to the Cylons on behalf of the people of New Caprica. Meanwhile, Thrace, Tigh, Roslin, Tyrol, Cally and others watch as Cylon Centurions march through the New Caprica settlement, and vow to resist. Notes *While the episode doesn't show the deaths of the Cavils, The Plan does. While the events of the season make it appear to the audience that the Cavils and Gina's deaths will be permanent, dialogue in The Plan indicates that the Cavils did in fact resurrect. No mention is ever made of Gina amongst the Cylons again, indicating that she is truly dead.

He was the young sidekick to the character TNT, and was created by Mort Weisinger and Hal Sharp in 1942. TNT and Dyna-Mite made their debut in Star Spangled Comics #7 and starred through #23. Fictional character biography Danny Dunbar was the star pupil of Thomas N. Thomas, a high school chemistry and physical education teacher. One evening while Thomas and Dunbar are working on an experiment, Thomas' hand accidentally touches Dunbar's and both teacher and student find themselves feeling more energized. Thomas realizes that each of them has somehow absorbed the chemicals with which they have been working. By touching each other, Thomas and Dunbar now become charged with an unknown form of energy and briefly possess superhuman powers. They decide not to reveal their discovery publicly for fear that it would be misused. Instead, they use their new super-powers to fight crime as costumed heroes. Thomas becomes known as TNT and Dunbar as Dan the Dyna-Mite, and both join the wartime All-Star Squadron. Thomas and Dunbar each wears a \\"dyna- ring\\". By pressing the rings together, Thomas and Dunbar trigger a chemical reaction that temporarily charges the two heroes with energy. In April 1942, TNT and Dyna-Mite battle Nazi saboteurs who are attempting to blow up a dam in Colorado. When the saboteurs flee in a car, the pair gives chase in their own auto. One of the bullets hits the tire of the heroes' car and it crashes and bursts into flames. The young hero Iron Munro pulls TNT and Dyna-Mite from the wreckage. TNT is already dead, and his spirit is carried off by the Valkyrie called Gudra (a member of Axis Amerika). Munro takes Dyna-Mite to a hospital, where he soon recovers. Danny is grief-stricken but bucks up when President Roosevelt requests that he and other young members of the All-Star Squadron take a cross-country tour to encourage the buying of war bonds. His depression is worsened by the assumption that without TNT, he can no longer use his own super-powers. Soon Danny learns he can activate them by wearing both dyna- rings and pressing them together. In his \\"golden years\\", Dan joins his childhood friends Neptune Perkins, Doiby Dickles, Merry Pemberton and the Cyclone Kids (now called the Cyclones) to form \\"Old Justice\\". They were all once sidekicks to older superheroes. They advocate abolishing teen super-teams and butt heads with Young Justice many times. Over the course of the Sins of Youth storyline, a rally in D.C. over this issue occurs. It is attacked and dozens of adult superheroes turn young and the Young Justice members turn adult. Old Justice, unaffected, find themselves having to supervise the chaotic crowd of younger heroes with the aid of the now-adult Young Justice. Temporarily working out of the JLA HQ in Happy Harbor, everyone must deal with Klarion the Witch Boy, other younger supervillains, and dozens of magically created monsters. It comes down to every available hand in a vicious battle in the snowfields outside an Alaskan scientific complex. At the end of the adventure, once Klarion is blackmailed into restoring the altered heroes, Old Justice realizes Young Justice really are worthy heroes. In 2010's DCU: Legacies #2, TNT and Dyna-Mite are revealed to have been founding members of the Seven Soldiers of Victory.http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2010/06/15/continue-to-explore-the- history-of-the-dcu-with-legacies-2/ How this retcon affects their histories, such as the previously established death of TNT and Dyna-Mite's Young All- Stars stint, has not yet been revealed. Powers and abilities As with his mentor, he possessed a ring which controlled his powers, releasing them only when the two rings came into contact. Originally he wore only one of the rings, which gave him enhanced strength, speed and resistance to injury and energy generation. But after his mentor died, he discovered he could wear both rings and release the power by pressing both rings together himself. Dyno- Mite Dan Functional forgeries of the rings were later bought online by a superhero wannabe who called himself Dyno-Mite Dan (Harris D. Ledbetter). He appeared only once, after joining the Vigilante's short-lived new Seven Soldiers of Victory. All members of this group were slaughtered by the Gods of the Miracle Mesa (the Sheeda). Other versions In the Elseworlds miniseries The Golden Age by James Robinson and Paul Smith, TNT is killed in an apparent accident, and Daniel Dunbar becomes very depressed. He volunteers for a government experiment (dropping an atomic bomb on him) which transforms him into the powerful Dynaman, who possesses vast superhuman strength, durability, and the power of flight. However, it is revealed late in the miniseries that the Ultra-Humanite removed Dunbar's brain and replaced it with that of Adolf Hitler. Members of the Justice Society and All-Star Squadron unite to defeat Dynaman in a colossal battle in Washington, DC.

Lewis High School opened in 1958 and is located in Springfield, Virginia. The school was originally named Robert E. Lee High School (Lee High School) after Robert E. Lee, an American and Confederate soldier, but starting at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year, it will be renamed John R. Lewis High School, after John Lewis, the recently deceased politician and civil rights leader. The school name changes began shortly after the vote was announced. The school mascot is the Lancer. History At the time the school opened, the Fairfax County school board was opposing racial integration of its schools and the name reflected the school board's sentiments. (uncited claim) According to the above unsourced and controversial footnote: \\"In Fairfax County,.... they defiantly named their next two high schools after Confederate army generals‚ÄîJ.E.B. Stuart and Robert E. Lee.\\" In the School Board meeting minutes of May 20, 1958, Lee High School was simply named \\"Lee\\" for the Lee district. The battle for the school name began on December 7, 1954, three years before construction had started and three and a half years before the school was opened and numerous articles spoke to the acrimony in the communities of Franconia and Springfield who both wanted to claim the school name for their community. This school was located on Franconia Road, on the border of Franconia and Springfield, the area had a Springfield address, and it was in the Lee district of Virginia. During a meeting on February 4, 1958, a local historical group suggested a compromise. The Upper Pohick Community League submitted a letter proposing that the School Board adopt a policy naming Fairfax County schools for prominent Virginians instead of by place names and that the Franconia High School be renamed something like \\"Fitzhugh, Lee, etc.\\" Fitzhugh Lee was suggested because he was born at the Clermont estate. Clermont elementary school is about 4 miles away. During a meeting on May 6, 1958, Mr. Solomon made a motion that all future new high schools in Fairfax County be named for some prominent American, now deceased. Mr. Solomon qualified it by stating that the \\"Franconia H. S.\\" is not to be included in this motion, just those under construction, or proposed. Therefore, a place name was needed for this school. Both communities were in the Lee district of Virginia and a compromise was reached on a place name. Mr. Woodson said he was \\"surprised and disappointed that we have this type of controversy among adults. I don't want the children coming to this school saying I'm from Springfield ... I'm from Franconia ... let's fight. Gangs tend to develop in communities where there is controversy.\\" School Board member Mr. Davis said that \\"He'd rather name a school Podunk then get into the battle like was over Lee High school.\\" The name JEB Stuart was chosen because he had his headquarters on Munson Hill, the site of the school. The naming of high schools in order was Lee, (for the Lee district, May 1958), Jeb Stuart and James Madison (same meeting, on Oct 7, 1958). Thomas Edison, George Marshall, and W.T. Woodson in 1960, Thomas Jefferson in 1962. In addition, nine intermediate schools were named by the same school board in May 1959. Among those school names were John G. Whittier and Henry Thoreau. Fifteen schools were named and only one was for a Confederate General. In 1963, Lee was renamed at the request of the SPTA.School Board minutes. July 16, 1963. That was six years later. Regarding Fairfax County's reaction to Brown: It was not Fairfax County's choice either before or after 1954. Fairfax County Schools, like most southern schools, were under de jure segregation. After the Brown v. Board of Education decision, Daniel Duke, who authored Education Empire wrote: \\"Whether local school systems such as Fairfax County left to their own, would have moved forward to implement desegregation in the late '50s will never be known. Richmond removed any possibility of local option.\\" it was recognized in court cases that it was the state who was running the show, not the county. They didn't have a choice. In the Virginia General Assembly: Delegates from Northern Virginia openly opposed the Stanley Plans as well as calls for even more radical legislation. Virginia's 10th district was the only congressional district to vote against the Gray Plan. On June 23, 2020, the school board unanimously voted to rename the school. On July 23, 2020, the Fairfax County School Board announced that the school would be renamed to John R. Lewis High School, after John Lewis, the recently deceased politician and civil rights leader. The name change will be effective for the 2020‚Äì2021 school year. Demographics In the 2016‚Äì2017 school year, Lewis High School's total enrollment was 2132, with a student body composed of 36.84% Hispanic, 25.41% Asian, 20.07% White, 14.10% Black, and 3.58% other.  Administration  Lewis High School has served the Springfield community since it opened in 1958. Like many schools in Fairfax County, Lewis reflects the increasing diversity of its student body. Student families have origins in 42 countries (mostly Latin American) and speak more than 34 languages. The integration of technology into the instructional program continues to be a major initiative. The labs are equipped with computers, digital cameras, and scanners for computer graphics and photography classes, and a fully computerized CAD lab is available for technical drawing and engineering classes. Deirdre Lavery was principal from 2014-2019. Alfonso Smith was appointed as principal in January 2020. Career Center Lewis High School has a College and Career Center inside the school. It is currently run by Carla McIlnay-Shaw (From the Career Center). Its goal is to provide students with college planning services through the use of computer software, videos, catalogs, and visits by college representatives from state and national colleges and universities. Career planning, military options, scholarship, and financial aid information are also available. Throughout the year, many special programs are presented for both parents and students. International Baccalaureate program The International Baccalaureate (IB) Program is open to all 11th and 12th-grade students at Lewis High School and presents a \\"varied and rigorous\\" program of studies. IB is a comprehensive, integrated program that places as much value on the process of knowledge (teaching the student to analyze and apply knowledge) as the product (preparing the student for the content and assessments). IB courses present options for students to pursue a mixture of major interests (higher level courses) and less major interests (standard level courses). With the IB program offered at Lewis High School, students are provided with an internationally recognized educational program which purports to provide a more rigorous and college-preparatory education. Furthermore, an advantage of taking IB courses in Lewis High School is that students get a chance to receive college credit (although the more common Advanced Placement, or AP, program also provides college credit.) Getting college credit depends on the score the student gets on their IB exam, usually a 6 or 7, and the guidelines for IB transfer credit the college or university the student chooses to attend has.  Student activities =Honor societies Students are selected for membership through an application process and sometimes interviews are conducted. Candidates must meet the chapter's requirement for scholarship, service, leadership, and character in order to be selected for membership. Continued participation in service projects is required to retain membership.

The Shield, Lewis's yearbook, serves as an informational record, memory and historical reference for the students and faculty as well as the Lewis High School's community at-large. The Shield covers academics, sports, student activities and student accomplishments with fairness and accuracy. The content is decided upon by the student staff members enrolled in Photojournalism 1, 2, and 3. Recruiting to become part of the staff typically takes place in early February when course selections are being made for the next year. Students are selected through a process that includes a written application, teacher recommendations, and interviews OR through successful completion of Journalism 1. Lewis's 2006‚Äì2007 edition of the yearbook was named a Pacemaker finalist. The Troubador is a literary magazine by and for the students of John R. Lewis High School, published to promote an interest in the arts by showcasing student art and literature.

He was Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford for 21 years, from 1970 to 1991. Life and academic career Wiles was educated at the Tonbridge School in Kent, and worked at Bletchley Park during World War II. He then studied at Christ's College, Cambridge, and Ridley Hall. After ordination in 1950 he spent two years as curate at St George's, Stockport, but then returned to Ridley Hall as chaplain. From 1955 to 1959 he was a lecturer in New Testament Studies at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. He again returned to Cambridge as dean of Clare College and university lecturer in early Christian doctrine. Before moving to Oxford as Regius Professor of Divinity he spent three years from 1967 to 1970 as professor of Christian doctrine at King's College London. Wiles served as a director of the four- yearly Oxford International Conference on Patristic Studies from 1971 until 1999. We was appointed a Fellow of King's College London in 1972 and Fellow of the British Academy in 1981. Miracles In his work God's Action in the World, he discusses the notion of a world that is consistent with Christian theology and the laws of nature. In doing so Wiles rejects the possibility that God directly intervenes in the world and therefore rejects the existence of miracles. Wiles accepts God as the sole creator of the world, yet believes he does not intervene in the world for a number of reasons. He believed we should not see God as playing an 'active role' but instead hold the belief that God created the world as he wanted in its entirety:Maurice Wiles (1986) God's Action in the World Therefore, God would not undermine the natural laws that he created by intervening in the world. Wiles also argued that an omnibenevolent God would not perform such trivial miracles as those which are normally observed: Wiles concluded that either God acts arbitrarily (and is therefore not worthy of worship) or that he does not intervene at all. However, the lack of miracles does not violate a belief in Christianity according to Wiles. Prayer, for instance, still has purpose but should not be understood as causing God to take action. Instead it should be a way of enabling a group or individual to connect with God's will: Likewise, the miracles of the Bible need not be rejected. Instead, they should be understood to have a symbolic role: to teach about God and faith in Christianity. Patristics and modern doctrine An expert in patristics as well as modern doctrine, Wiles was particularly interested in the development of doctrine and questions of orthodoxy and heresy. His book The Making of Christian Doctrine was a critical look at whether early doctrinal affirmations could remain valid when the framework of their intellectual background had shifted. His Working Papers in Doctrine collected together a number of his journal articles on patristic thought. Several of his works focused on (the heresiarch) Arius and the history of Arianism, including Archetypal Heresy. Arianism through the centuries. Wiles continued to defend the possibility of a reasonable Christian faith, free from historical and dogmatic commitments which could not be defended on critical grounds but confident in the essential truthfulness and trustworthiness of God, until the end of his life. Wiles's broad interests in doctrine were reflected in the contributions to his Festschrift, published in 1993.David A. Pailin and Sarah Coakley (eds.), The Making and Remaking of Christian Doctrine: Essays in Honour of Maurice Wiles (Oxford University Press, 1993) A short critical study of his thought was published in 1987 by the Dutch theologian Gerard Rothuizen (1925‚Äì88).G. Theodoor Rothuizen, Apologetics in Oxford: The Theology of Maurice F. Wiles (Kampen, Netherlands: Kok, 1987) The Journal of Theological Studies In 1986, Wiles succeeded Henry Chadwick as editor of The Journal of Theological Studies. He edited the journal along with the biblical scholar Morna Hooker. Wiles's editorship concluded with the centenary issue of the journal, published in October 1999, to which he contributed an article charting the journal's origins and history. Family His father was Sir Harold Herbert Wiles, Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and National Service. Maurice Wiles was husband to Patricia Wiles.

It can be divided into several distinct groups, each one separate from the others, yet consistently interacting with the others. The first group is the staff of D≈çmori Elementary, made up of the teachers and other adults (mostly) who assist in the education and welfare of the students. These include N≈´bƒì, his \\"perverted obsession\\" Ritsuko Takahashi, and other teachers of the school, as well as the principal. The second, is the student body of D≈çmori Elementary, each of whom brings a different personality and set of experiences brought both to their education and experiences with the supernatural. Most of these characters are the students of N≈´bƒì's class 5-3, but also includes other students in other classes, both in the fifth and other grades (such as Hiroshi's soccer teammates and Makoto's \\"girlfriend\\", Ai Shinozaki). The third, are the various y≈çkai N≈´bƒì and the citizens of D≈çmori encounter. Many of these spirits appear once and never appear again after their chapter of focus. Others show up at least that one time, and then cameo here and there during certain chapters where various spirits reappear for the better or worse of N≈´bƒì and the others. And still others, such as the y≈çko Tamamo and the yuki-onna Yukime, end up becoming intertwined in the events of Doumori, either assisting or tormenting N≈´bƒì as they feel at that moment! The last group of characters are humans who do not quite fit in any of the other categories, yet consistently are connected to the affairs of N≈´bƒì or his students. These include other exorcists like \\"itako-girl\\" Izuna Hazuki and crooked Buddhist priest Osh≈ç, normal recurring characters, and even the parents of the 5-3 students! Doumori Elementary staff The main characters are a group of fifth grade teachers at Doumori Elementary. Meisuke Nueno , commonly known as , is a 25-year-old man with two jobs. First off, he's a powerful exorcist who deals with the affairs between humans and y≈çkai in his adopted home of Doumori. Second, and just as importantly, he's the teacher of class 5-3 of Doumori Elementary, both guiding and protecting them from the spiritual encounters they face. Both jobs are equally important to him in their own ways: he chooses to protect the innocent and punish the wicked, both human and y≈çkai, focusing primarily on those still young and innocent enough to have the need of a guardian, as his teacher had done before her death. N≈´bƒì is trained as an exorcist to have many means of facing his y≈çkai encounters. The most powerful of these tools, though, is the , the result of a battle with a powerful oni in his former school he teaches when the Oni attacks one of his pupils, leaving him forced to seal its power within the stump where his left hand should be. This grotesque appendage, usually sealed within a black glove on his left hand, if unsealed, allows him to use his own spiritual energies combined with the powers of the oni both to attack evil opponents and for other means, such as communicating with other y≈çkai or freeing spirits. While N≈´bƒì typically is able to control the power, he is usually only able to use a fraction of its true powers and abilities, for the oni is so powerful Nube himself can't control it and can devour his body and will if became overboard. The oni is actually being held by N≈´bƒì's Sensei, who died being consumed by the oni when trying to save N≈´bƒì. N≈´bƒì's teacher is also a powerful exorcist and her ultimate sacrifice that left her killed is the reason N≈´bƒì wanted to become both a teacher and an exorcist. Other than the Oni no Te, N≈´bƒì uses other spiritual artifacts for his battles. , a white paper-like sutra, is used by N≈´bƒì to surround and seal certain y≈çkai phenomenon to either hold them down or exorcise them without the need of the Oni no Te,as for a blind kid ghost. He also possesses a crystal ball which can make certain spirits and phenomenon visible to the human eye,like when he spotted something on one of his students, and a set of prayer beads he can attack with or use as part of his summonings. He also eventually creates his own kudagitsune, a product of another kudagitsune he borrows from itako-girl Izuna and his Oni no Te, and has mastered several spiritual techniques such as the \\"youshin jutsu\\" (a technique where he can create a separate spiritual body that moves about by itself whenever he is asleep or meditating), and the separation of his physical body and spirit in order to transcend into other realms,for example,for challenging a ghost of a swimmer. Personality-wise, N≈´bƒì can be both a great, fun-loving guy or a serious, focused man dependent on what you see him for. On matters of either spiritual or educational importance, he is a serious individual focused on doing the job perfectly. Not only does this allow him to conquer one y≈çkai crisis after another, but it also allows him to be a bit obsessive towards making sure his students learn what they need to and don't fool around or forget anything. (a problem considering the underachieving attributes of several of his male students). Outside his work, though, N≈´bƒì is a fun, almost happy-go-lucky guy with too many faults to his name. He is always chasing after beautiful women (especially the more buxom ones), spending the little money he does have on pachinko, and consistently starving his way to payday while living off whatever they serve in school cafeteria or the freebies he can get, or finding a way to get rich quick (even if it means using the Oni no Te to do so), all the while trying to avoid the scorns or troubles that his rivals throw his way. While he doesn't like living the teacher's life a good chunk of the time, N≈´bƒì does find that it does has its rewards. Voiced by: Ry≈çtar≈ç Okiayu Played by: Ryuhei Maruyama Ritsuko Takahashi Head teacher of class 5-2 of Doumori Elementary, is considered the madonna (term for \\"beautiful unmarried woman\\") of the school. She is very serious and dedicated to her job as a teacher, but at the same time is very edgy and overtly scared when it comes to the unknown, in particular the spirits and y≈çkai the school constantly encounters. Her nature is a double- edged blade for N≈´bƒì: while her beautiful exterior makes him desire her and all the things he wants to do to her, her oversensitive nature towards the supernatural like the antics about spirits and his artifacts makes him tease her all the time about it...and face her wrath as a result. At the start of the series, Ritsuko-sensei is probably the last person N≈´bƒì would ever end up with in a relationship. Every time he tried to win her heart, she would knock him away due to being too scared of his spiritual obsessions. But as the series progresses, she slowly gains the courage to face the y≈çkai menaces...and as a result, slowly realizes how N≈´bƒì is helping all those in need...and even begins to appreciate what he does both for students and all those he assists. But while her feelings slowly makes her try to become closer to the male teacher, it ends up attracting scorn from Yukime, the yuki-onna who sees herself as the one who is the teacher's true love. The love triangle between the two teachers and the spirit girl becomes a key theme in the later part of the manga, as N≈´bƒì is forced to decide between feelings and emotions and figure out which he wants to spend his life with. Voiced by: Michiko Neya Played by: Mirei Kiritani Ishikawa-sensei Ishikawa-sensei (Áü≥Â∑ùÂÖàÁîü) is a teacher found alongside the 5th Grade teachers, most likely the gym teacher for that grade. Consistently running around in a jumpsuit and with his messy hair, beard and glasses, he occasionally assists in the issuance of advice and known spiritual information out of what he has known and experienced. However, he is also somewhat of a bad influence himself, known for keeping cards for various porn shops in his jumpsuit. (as N≈´bƒì accidentally discovers one time when they fall out of a borrowed suit) Although it is unknown whether or not he really is a 5th Grade teacher, Ishikawa-sensei is commonly seen alongside the 5th Grade teachers, thus his inclusion here. He also has a tendency of avoiding showers up to more than a month, and has a fetish for wearing women's undergarment, which turned out working against Nube when Minki, the sister of the Oni no Te (Baki) comes from hell to reclaim them. Voiced by: Yoshiyuki Kouno ≈åtsuki-sensei The hot-blooded head of class 5-1 of Doumori Elementary, ≈åtsuki-sensei (Â§ßÊúàÂÖàÁîü) is another exorcist/teacher combination. However, unlike N≈´bƒì, he believes that all phenomenon are a result of plasma, not spiritual power. These beliefs lead to the two teachers consistently feuding over what is the true nature of the many problems that persist in and around the school; while the students in both classes also face off due to the loyalties to their home-teacher's beliefs. Using his own scientific knowhow and research, he uses several devices and inventions that allow him to research and take out any of these threats. (sort of similar to the scientific research and inventions done in Ghostbusters). Although Ootsuki-sensei appears a couple prominent times early on, he merely fades into the background as the manga goes on. Voiced by: Yasunori Masutani Other staff membersThe Principal The administrative leader of the elementary school, the principal consistently tries to do a good job in keeping his school running smoothly and without error even with all of the crazy spiritual phenomenon going on under his watch. While he may or may not have known that N≈´bƒì was both an exorcist and a teacher when he started working at this school, he soon prides it as a valuable asset to assisting in his staff. The Vice-Principal Not too much is known about this flat-topped, glasses wearing administrative outside being an associate alongside the Principal in running Doumori Elementary and consistently being in the background along with his boss and the other teachers and staff of the school. Mami Kuroi One of the newer teachers at Doumori Elementary, Mami Kuroi (Kuroi Mami, Èªí‰∫ï „Åæ„Åø) is the head of the first-grade class of 1-3. However, opposed to N≈´bƒì's exorcisms, her interests and studies are in the occult and witchcraft, having studied in a German university and across Europe to further her own knowledge and skills in such. Although she looks like a little girl, she's actually 28 years old, several years older than the more experienced N≈´bƒì. N≈´bƒì does not like her obsession with the evil arts and yells at her from doing them. It doesn't help that her 1st Grade classroom is two floors down from his 5th Grade class, forcing him to occasionally feel the influence of her magic unknowingly. (until he comes down and puts a stop to her nonsense) Some of her various magic skills include various curses, summonings, transformations, voodoo dolls and even flying on her own little broomstick. (not to mention a flat-top hat that rises into a witches hat whenever she does her magic) When Kuroi-sensei first arrives at the school, she is immediately smitten by her male staff-mate and decides to use her magic to try and win him over. (including sealing his Oni no Te inside a cute hand-made glove) But after consistently being yelled at by N≈´bƒì, not to mention possibly seeing both Ritsuko-sensei and Yukime go after him, she decides to summon her own demonic love slave in the form of the \\"Western Devil\\" Beelzebub. Students=Class 5-3 The students of Class 5-3. =Hiroshi Tateno= Hiroshi Tateno (Tateno Hiroshi Á´ãÈáéÂ∫É) is the main male student character in the series and one of N≈´bƒì's most active supporters. A transfer student who arrives in Doumori Elementary at the start of the manga, he is at first suspicious of his teacher's exorcism claims, but eventually comes around due to being saved from one spiritual problem after another. Typical of many young sh≈çnen leads in manga and anime, he is the courageous, heroic male of the class who is always standing up to fight against any obstacle, whether they be human or y≈çkai or whether it makes sense or not. His favorite pastime is playing soccer for the school. Hiroshi's downside is his own stupidity: he has some of the worst grades in N≈´bƒì's class and once even set a record for having a hundred 0s in a row on his tests. This lack of brains both causes him to have outlandish comments on simple ideas and leads him to many of his y≈çkai problems. He once even wet his pants after a ghost scared him in a restroom. His character's name is a tribute to the main male lead of Dokonjyou Gaeru, a classic 70s Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump series Shou and Okano used as an influence for \\"N≈´bƒì\\". Voiced by: Toshiko Fujita Played by: Taishi Nakagawa =Ky≈çko Inaba= The fiery-haired, fiery tempered female of N≈´bƒì's class, Ky≈çko Inaba (Inaba Ky≈çko Á®≤ËëâÈÉ∑Â≠ê) is the student that trusts and even possibly likes the teacher the most. Her first encounter with him actually occurred several years earlier, when N≈´bƒì (then a college student) saved Ky≈çko (then a little girl) from an inari spirit. (though it is suggested they may have met earlier in a past life) She is seen as one of the most caring characters, usually looking after the welfare of N≈´bƒì and the rest of the class and showing an emotional attachment towards them whenever something happens to one she cares about. But while Ky≈çko appears cute and innocent at first, she can possess a violent temper that can drive her friends and even her teacher a tad crazy (though it does tone down later on). When Hiroshi joins the class, she can't stand the annoying boy, but slowly does develop hidden romantic feelings towards him as the series goes on. On the other hand, she consistently has a love/hate rivalry with the closest to a best friend that she has, Miki Hosokawa, usually over physical matters such as her flat chest, big butt, and Sailor Moon-esque pigtails. Her name is an homage to the female lead of Dokonjyou Gaeru. (where, not coincidentally, this Ky≈çko is also in love with a Hiroshi) Voiced by: Rumi Kasahara Played by: Airi Matsui =Miki Hosokawa= Possibly the greatest troublemaker in N≈´bƒì's class, Miki Hosokawa (Hosokawa Miki Á¥∞Â∑ùÁæéÊ®π) is known best for her big mouth, her vast spiritual knowledge and her big bust. At the start, Miki was a mere tattletale, consistently chatting on and on about various rumors and such, especially if N≈´bƒì was involved. But after a near-fatal encounter with a tattletale y≈çkai that first pinned blame on her for several downright hurtful rumors and then attempted to eat her, she begins to tone down her talking and starts focusing on more spiritual matters. Miki begins to do consistent research on various spirit and y≈çkai manners, to the point where even her teacher came to her for things he may not know. Most of this is merely knowledge, she consistently looks for supernatural means to assist her, either for her rumor mill or to get rich quick. One of her most important spiritual developments was gaining the ability to become a rokurokubi, where she can spiritually stretch her head and neck to go undercover to anywhere she chooses. Extremely vain about her physicality, Miki prides in her growing buxom figure (she grows from a B-cup to an F-cup over the course of the series) and flaunts it whenever she can. Her name (as well as her hairstyle and physical\\"attributes\\") is an homage to the tragic Miki Makimura, the main heroine in another of the main N≈´bƒì influences: Go Nagai's classic horror series Devilman. Voiced by: Miina Tominaga Played by: Hinako Sano =Katsuya Kimura= The \\"juvenile delinquent\\" of the class, Katsuya Kimura (Kimura Katsuya Êú®ÊùëÂÖã‰πü) acts much worse than he really is towards N≈´bƒì and his other classmates. At the start of the series, Katsuya is consistently portrayed as a loner, either due to being misunderstood by his classmates, his own cowardice or from his delinquent behaviors such as smoking or stealing charity for a good cause. But as the series goes on, he slowly comes to grips with himself and joins in with N≈´bƒì and his friends where he is one of the main members of the class. Katsuya is a huge pervert towards sexy females, an attribute that gets him into a huge idolation of Miki. (though she sees treats him like her dog) He also finds himself consistently with the worst grades in class alongside both Hiroshi and Makoto. But while he is a coward and a bad seed, he is amazingly also a loving, caring and protective big brother towards his little sister, Manami. Voiced by: Kazunari Tanaka Played by: Ryo Yoshizawa =Makoto Kurita= While the same age as all of his classmates, Makoto Kurita (Kurita Makoto Ê†óÁî∞„Åæ„Åì„Å®) is perhaps the youngest in heart and spirit of class 5-3. At the start of the series, this bowl-haired boy finds himself the most emotional of the students, running and screaming away from any scary phenomenon. But with N≈´bƒì's guidance and the assistance of his friends, he slowly learns to face his fears and grow up in certain ways. One of Makoto's greatest strengths is his kind and friendly nature, allowing him to try and remain cheerful in the face of both human and y≈çkai threats. However, he remains the most childlike of N≈´bƒì's students, both in stature (though he is small, he is constantly hoping for the day he will \\"grow up\\") and his love of kiddy pastimes like keeping pets or watching sentai series. (His most favorite being Chou Kiken Sentai Kakukaku Ranger which is a slight parody in name of the series Ninja Sentai Kaku Ranger, but translates as Extremely Dangerous Sentai Nuclear Ranger) While he also receives horrible grades like Hiroshi and Katsuya, he actually puts in effort to try to improve himself in any way possible. His name and the model for his character design are both inspired from the Kazuo Umezu manga series Makoto-chan. Voiced by: Megumi Urawa Played by: Yuri Chinen =Akira Yamaguchi= Akira Yamaguchi (Yamaguchi Akira Â±±Âè£Êô∂), one of the smartest students in N≈´bƒì's class, is also the one that goes through a slight character change as the series goes on. At the start of the series, Akira is merely a bright, but slightly unlucky boy who tries his best but can never achieve what he's capable of. The source of this bad luck was a near-death experience where he went to the Sanzu River, where a y≈çkai consistently stops anyone that tries to complete their tasks. After N≈´bƒì exorcises this spirit, Akira finds a bit more luck, but remains a more generic character. But later in the series, Akira's modest personality changes towards that of being the \\"mad scientist\\" of the class, consistently using technology to bridge the gap between humans and y≈çkai and showing off in order to do so. Originally, Akira was paired alongside Hiroshi, Kyoko, Makoto and Miki as part of the main set of students whom allies with N≈´bƒì. But because of Akira's earlier \\"plain\\" personality, he fell out of favor over more dynamic characters like Katsuya. Regardless, he does remain a semi-major character throughout the whole manga run. Like Miki, Akira's name is based on the main male lead in Go Nagai's Devilman. Voiced by: Michiyo Yanagisawa Played by: Kazuki Shimizu =Shuichi Shirato= The richest and most snobbish member of N≈´bƒì's class, Shuichi Shirato (Shirato Shuichi ÁôΩÊà∏ÁßÄ‰∏Ä) is the son of the owners of one of the finest restaurants in Doumori. Because of this, this \\"classy\\" boy consistently taunts N≈´bƒì's personal tastes, both in cuisine and in his lack of material possessions. But while there are many times the teacher can't stand his arrogant attitude, N≈´bƒì consistently finds a way to help him whenever he finds himself caught in a y≈çkai situation. In a slight deviation from his teacher and classmates, Shuichi finds interest in more scientific means of the supernatural such as aliens and cryptozoology, trying to show there are things other than y≈çkai out there, but consistently finding N≈´bƒì back to assist him. Still, Shuuichi isn't an evil person per se; he also sincerely loves animals, to the point of being willing to give up his life to stop an angry y≈çkai that once was a puppy. Voiced by: Junichi Kanemaru Played by: Gaku Sano =Masaru Kaneda= Masaru Kaneda (Kaneda Masaru ÈáëÁî∞Âãù) is the self-proclaimed \\"class bully\\" of 5-3, consistently trying to beat up on others weaker than he is (such as Makoto) and finding dissidence with anyone that stands in his way. But two things consistently end up foiling his schemes: Hiroshi (who stands up for those Kaneda bullies) and the y≈çkai whom haunt him whenever he ends up disturbing one. His biggest gripe is when his name is mispronounced as \\"Kintama Saru\\", which is Japanese for \\"testicle monkey\\". Though he mostly works alone, he occasionally has two lackeys in the class that he bosses around. Voiced by: Ginzou Matsuo Played by: Takeaki Shima =Noriko Nakajima= Noriko Nakajima (Nakajima Noriko ‰∏≠Â≥∂Ê≥ïÂ≠ê) is the sweet, cute, and possibly most \\"normal\\" girl in class 5-3 compared to some of her classmates. Unlike the others, Noriko never tries to look for trouble, but trouble constantly does seem to find her. Originally a \\"background character\\" early on (mostly found alongside her best friend Shizuka), \\"Noro-chan\\" slowly becomes one of the more prominent members of the class and a consistent target for spiritual activity. Miki in particular has a beef against her: With her cute face, shoulder-length pink hair and the second-largest bust in the class, the buxom blonde always gets upset whenever Noriko steals the spotlight away from her (consistently saying Noro-chan no kuse ni!!, or \\"That Noro-chan!\\") While she does seem docile and quiet, Noriko does occasionally unleash a wilder and more playful side (but it takes certain y≈çkai phenomenon to do so). She's also known as a bookworm and a rather clever tactician; once she was the key to resolving a very creepy case that involved the ghost of the school library and a series of kidnappings related to the ghost's favorite book, which incidentally was the same as Noriko's. Voiced by: Machiko Toyoshima Played by: Kaho Mizutani =Shizuka Kikuchi= Another of the more prominent \\"background characters\\", Shizuka Kikuchi (Kikuchi Shizuka ËèäÂú∞Èùô) was actually introduced as a one-joke character. When N≈´bƒì does a class on the Ichimatsu Doll, he ends up using a cute girl with long black hair (Shizuka) as part of a joke to get rid of a possession. Outside this early joke, this female typically is found in the background, either doing things alongside the rest of the class or hanging out usually with her best friend Noriko. But while she seems merely innocent in the background, a later chapter reveals that it allows her to easily tattle on her classmates to N≈´bƒì, due to a strong sense of justice that she holds that she puts above her friends. (It nearly gets her in trouble with a dangerous team of y≈çkai.) Voiced by: Emi Uwagawa Played by: Sara Takatsuki =Ayumi Kinoshita= A quiet, studious member of class 5-3, Ayumi Kinoshita (Kinoshita Ayumi Êú®‰∏ã„ÅÇ„ÇÜ„Åø) is another student who has a spiritual ability, but one that actually helps her in more ways than one. Typically, Ayumi is a sickly, bedridden girl that would possibly have never had the chance to get an education. Yet when she was younger, N≈´bƒì (who was still in college) taught her the \\"youshin jutsu\\", an ability that allows her to separate her spiritual body from her physical one, making her seem that she can walk and live like a normal person. Using this, Ayumi was able to partake in an education at Doumori Elementary, and even joined N≈´bƒì's class when she hit 5th grade. Since it takes many years of practice to master this, her youshin abilities is not in complete form as it would dissolve whenever she gets in contact with water. Ayumi's favorite pastime is reading, spending all her time in class or even outside reading books without taking too much notice of the fun and activities of her classmates (though there are some occasions where she joins in). While Ayumi usually uses her youshin abilities to try to live a normal life as a schoolgirl, she can also use it to transform her physical form or her clothing to something more adventurous, which came in handy when Hiroshi, Kyoko and the others nearly got in trouble. Furthermore, she may even have a small crush on Kaneda (thanks to a possible literary awakening due to her influence) and he is possibly the only person other than N≈´bƒì who knows about her true nature. Other studentsMamoru Kazama= Another gifted at football from Doumori Elementary beside Hiroshi Tateno, Mamoru Kazama (Kazama Mamoru, È¢®ÈñìÂÆà) is a student in Ritsuko Takahashi's class 5-2. Voiced by Mari Maruta =Ai Shinozaki= Considered one of the most talented students at Doumori Elementary, Ai Shinozaki (Shinozaki Ai, ÁØ†Â¥éÊÑõ) is a sixth-grader in class 6-5, one year ahead of Nube's class. A member of the Shinozaki zaibatsu, she's a beautiful girl who looks older than she really is (she's tall and slender, and with a big bust that rivals Miki's and Ritsuko-sensei's), has mastery of several musical instruments including the violin and piano (in the anime, her episode happens right after she wins a violin contest), as well as fluency of three foreign languages other than Japanese. However, under this perfect exterior, this spectacle-wearing female has many problems of her own. Ai grows tired of consistently practicing under the pressure of her family in order to succeed, detests being treated as a goddess by others who only think of her as someone who'll make them look good for being her friends, and also has problems in occasionally shoplifting to get things without paying for them (according to her, she developed this habit to reassure herself that she was a normal person with flaws). It is these problems that get her in problems with the occasional y≈çkai, who illuminate her own problems and end up exposing her to N≈´bƒì and the right path. In this case, Ai was possessed by a demon that manifested itself as tell-tale eyes that would appear on her hand and later on her whole body, and didn't disappear until she openly confessed to Nube and Makoto, until then her only friend, that she was a shoplifter and the reason why she stole things. While Ai seems to hold a lonely life, she somehow has befriended Makoto and may feel something more for him, though he doesn't really notice any romantic feelings and would rather use her to sing the theme songs of his favorite sentai shows. Ai's name is connected to a series of horror films involving another set of children named \\"Ai and Makoto\\" (explaining possibly why she has connections towards him). Voiced by Hitomi Oikawa Played by Yurika Nakamura =Izuna Hazuki= Izuna Hazuki (Hazuki Izuna, ËëâÊúà„ÅÑ„Åö„Å™) is a student at Doumori Middle School, a hot blooded and reckless apprentice-level Itako, that usually overestimates her abilities and gets herself into trouble. She likes to use her powers to get in exchange for money and often got scolded by Nube because of it. She is an expert kudagitsune tamer. Voiced by Chieko Honda Played by Mizuki Yamamoto Monster characters=Oni The Oni within N≈´bƒì are extremely powerful demon creature that literally come from the depths of hell to cause havoc and destruction upon our world. Unlike many oni depictions within popular Japanese culture, these oni are a hybrid combination of the classic horned loin-cloth being and Western devil beasts with claws, horns and immense strength and demonic powers. All of the oni, particularly the Oni no Te and its connections, are beings from an eight-tiered hell, where various devils and demonic beings become more powerful the deeper you head. The demon trio come from the 6th tier of this hell, Shonetsu (ÁÑ¶ÁÜ±, which translates into \\"scorching heat\\", but in the combination ÁÑ¶ÁÜ±Âú∞ÁçÑ, shonetsu jigoku, can stand for Inferno or Burning Hell). Each one has climbed their way through the upper levels of hell until they have reached a passage into the human world: near a spinning sphere in the playground of Doumori Elementary. =Oni no Te (Baki)= The first and possibly most powerful of the oni we encounter, this is the being living as N≈´bƒì's left hand from the beginning of the series. Sealed under a black glove, this being is unleashed whenever the teacher needs it, allowing for him to access a greater extent of his spiritual power through this demonic limb. While the beast appears to be under N≈´bƒì's control at first, the Oni slowly starts having a life of its own and unleashing its tremendous full power. And while the teacher is himself an exorcist, he cannot control the oni on his own, which would lead to him being controlled and devoured. The key to this control lies inside the oni itself, in the spirit of his former teacher Minako-sensei, locked away within the demon after her tragic sacrifice to save her former student. She uses her own spiritual power to hold back the Oni, allowing Nube to access its power without becoming consumed by it; because she is needed to keep the beast at bay, N≈´bƒì is constantly looking for a twofold way to both finally control the Oni once and for all and free his former teacher from her imprisonment inside the creature that has become his left hand. Later in the series, we discover that he is the eldest (and most dim-witted) brother of a trio of oni siblings, but still extremely powerful if left to his own devices. At the end of the series, he became good after all the good deeds he experienced. =Zekki= The middle brother of the Oni trio, Zekki (Áµ∂È¨º) is the most cruel and heartless beings N≈´bƒì and his allies face. Although he appears like a young teenage male, he is an extremely powerful and dangerous being who takes pleasure in killing anyone who gets in his way: male or female, young or old. His greatest peculiarity is the usage of musical terms (and even a baton) to describe the carnage and destruction he creates. Zekki comes to the human world after three years of climbing in search of the man who now possesses his brother Baki: the exorcist-teacher N≈´bƒì. After easily thrashing Izuna Hazuki the Itako girl, he makes easy work of N≈´bƒì, Yukime and Tamamo in order to see the hidden 'power' the teacher supposedly used to seal Baki in his hand. Once he realized that N≈´bƒì did not seal his brother on his own, relying instead on Minako's control from inside the oni, he decides to stay his hand no longer. The battles between the trio and Zekki grew more desperate, with N≈´bƒì on the losing side despite the help of a true demon-sealing bracelet. After sacrifices made by N≈´bƒì's students, Yukime and Tamamo, N≈´bƒì voluntarily unsealed the oni inside his hand and was apparently consumed by Baki. He retained his human heart, however, and after defeating Zekki was revived by the mermaid Hayame. Voiced by: Hikaru Midorikawa Played by: Ryosuke Yamada =Minki= Minki (Áú†È¨º) is the youngest, but just as destructive (and annoying) female sibling of the oni family. Although she possesses similar power and abilities to her older brothers Baki and Zekki, the source of her (and possibly all the oni) power comes from a pair of panties that she wears. (according to legend, most of an oni's spiritual power comes from their underwear or loincloth) When she accidentally loses her panties in the human world, she is forced to cross over to get them back, even if it means making everyone at Doumori Elementary nude in the process. Although she sort of gets them back (they were being worn by the perverted Ishikawa-sensei), N≈´bƒì seizes them and, in a strange move, makes the Oni-girl join his class. His belief was that outside her panty-powers, Minki was a quiet, nice girl who needed to learn a few things. Although she seemed rather strange at first, Minki showed a protective, kinder side than she initially portrayed, even protecting her classmates just as N≈´bƒì does. But at the moment she got her panties back, Minki regained her full, demonic power and attitude, fighting against her teacher and particularly showing hatred for the males of the class. But at the climax of her rampage, just as she prepared to destroy her teacher and school, her panties fell off her body once again, making her drop her attack and nearly destroying her in the process. N≈´bƒì saves her, however, believing her to be different from the other Oni and choosing to give her a second chance in the human world. After nearly destroying the school and N≈´bƒì, Minki becomes both a valuable student and a key ally in his battle to protect his students and fight against intruding enemies and y≈çkai. Although she does not contain all of her Oni power as she did with her panties, she does have enough to occasionally play naughty tricks on her friends and classmates. (she slowly does seem to accept them as friends, but has a hard time doing so due to her own circumstances) She is also able to assist her teacher in a valuable way: as he faces a couple enemies that force the Oni no Te away from him, Minki is able to fuse with N≈´bƒì to allow for her Oni power to be used by him. A key difference between her and Baki's arrangement, though, is that the teacher is able to use a fuller extent of Minki's power due to theirs being a conscious partnership. Outside of battle, Minki not only sees N≈´bƒì as her teacher, but her \\"big brother\\" as well, as her 'real' big brother is sealed in his hand. This leads to some rather awkward situations between the meaning of being a human sibling to being an Oni sibling. As a final note: Minki is the only member of the Oni siblings that does not have a full demonic form. Although she can exhibit oni appearance such as her scantly clad appearance and demonic hands and feet, this form takes more of a human appearance than either Zekki or Baki. (possibly showing an influence from the American comic series Witchblade) Just as peculiarly, two horn-like protrusions that allow for the formation of her long pigtails remain visible both in \\"human\\" and \\"Oni\\" forms. Kitsune Long a well known y≈çkai, the kitsune are a group of animal spirits usually connected with foxes. While any fox is a kitsune, there are special foxes, known as y≈çko who are some of the most spiritually powerful beings in existence. Y≈çko are known to have many different abilities at their disposal, such as the creation and manipulation of illusions and fire, as well as the ability to use a special \\"transformation jutsu\\" that can allow them to blend in with humans, usually to cause chaos and mischief within our world. At the same time, the kitsune and y≈çko are also connected with inari, local harvest festivals in Japan upon which play an integral role within. =Tamamo= Tamamo (ÁéâËóª), also known as Ky≈çsuke Tamamo (Tamamo Ky≈çsuke ÁéâËóª‰∫¨‰ªã) in his human form, is the most important of the y≈çko in the manga series: a powerful being who is both N≈´bƒì's ally and ultimate rival. First arriving at Doumori Elementary as a bish≈çnen male teacher who wins the hearts and minds of his students and fellow staff, his true intent was to seize the skull of N≈´bƒì's student Hiroshi Tateno which is his 'perfect skull' for transforming into a human. When N≈´bƒì was forced to come to Hiroshi's rescue, the two got into an intense battle upon which the true form of the golden fox-creature was revealed and nearly defeated N≈´bƒì. Due to Hiroshi's courage, however, Tamamo was defeated, though not for good. He returned soon after, intrigued by N≈´bƒì and how his powers was amplified when fighting for his students. He learns that it is the power of the human heart, and not understanding it, tries to know more by creating situations that force N≈´bƒì to fight or via simple observation. Tamamo also abandoned his teacher's disguise to work as a doctor in Doumori Hospital, where his 400 years of knowledge accumulated to cause misery went into healing others, which he thought would be a good way to learn more about humanity. Having existed and trained his spiritual powers for centuries, Tamamo has become adept in many spiritual powers and abilities that he holds even without perfecting his \\"transformation jutsu\\". He is a master of \\"illusion jutsu\\", able to manipulate anyone to see whatever he portrays as long as there is motion. (even to the extent of creating clones of himself off the display of video game screens) Offensively, he uses a \\"y≈çko foxfire jutsu\\", allowing him to create and control a powerful fire-based attack which he can increase in power and intensity to burn his opponents. He can also handle certain other spiritual abilities like Nube's such as assisting in controlling spiritual energy and even the \\"youshin jutsu\\". When not using spiritual power, his main weapon is a paw-like neck catcher, which primary function is the extraction of suitable skulls for his \\"transformation jutsu\\", but can also be broken apart to surround himself and an opponent within a barrier for more powerful attacks. In the manga, it was revealed that the skull he was currently using in the course of the series came from a dead mountain climber, who was a well-to-do college student. The encounter between Tamamo and the student's fiancee marked one of the important turning points in his character development. At the start of the series, Tamamo merely seems like a powerful y≈çkai who manipulates and fights as a means for his own selfish desires. After fighting alongside N≈´bƒì and class 5-3 and solving a number of youkai problems, he grew fonder and fonder of the human race, to the extent that he would use \\"Megido\\", his most powerful fire-based ability, in order to destroy Zekki, the younger brother of N≈´bƒì's Oni no Te. Tamamo also found himself unable to take Hiroshi's skull even when the opportunity presented himself later on, having learned too much of the human heart. This is a problem for him, as without a suitable skull his mental and physical faculties would eventually erode, leaving him to die as only a shell of his former self. In the manga liner notes for Volume 2, the author stated that Tamamo was intended to be a direct descendant of the Nine-Tailed Kitsune who was notorious as Tamamo no Mae. However, the fox appeared later in the story and was less than fond of Tamamo, thus leaving the name to be most likely an allusion, perhaps out of respect. Voiced by: Toshiyuki Morikawa Played by: Mokomichi Hayami =The Golden Nine-Tail Kitsune= Considered to be one of the most powerful y≈çkai in existence, The Golden Nine-Tail Kitsune (Konmougyokumen Ky≈´bi no Kitsune ÈáëÊØõÁéâÈù¢‰πùÂ∞æ„ÅÆÁãê) is one of the few beings that can overpower even the Oni. In ancient times, this kitsune made its way across India and China to Japan, where it last appeared 800 years ago as Tamamo no Mae, the wife who bewitched the Emperor Toba. Based within a chamber beneath the Sesshou Stone in Nasuno, Tochigi Prefecture, it has an immense hatred for humans and only desires either the death or lack of exposure to these \\"lower beings\\". N≈´bƒì is forced to undertake various tests from this powerful 3000-year old y≈çkai when Tamamo slowly falls apart due to his failure to complete his \\"transformation jutsu\\" abilities. Besides having immense abilities in illusion, transformation and fire, it can also summon a special \\"Trial Jar\\" for its y≈çko followers to deem their worthiness by undertaking escape without the use of their powers. Eventually, the fox also grew interested in Tamamo's fondness of humanity, and grants him enough power to continue living in his current form. =Tsuwabukimaru= Tsuwabukimaru( Áü≥Ëïó‰∏∏) appears when Tamamo becomes very sick, reminding him of his path to complete his \\"transformation justu\\" in order to prevent from turning into ashes. He is a young kitsune who holds a great deal of admiration for Tamamo, and does not want him to die. Not understanding the relationship the Tamamo now holds with humans, he was intent on getting Hiroshi's skull and was only stopped at the last second by the person he himself admired. He blames N≈´bƒì for Tamamo's slide into weakness and his eventual degradation, although he was still convinced to lead the teacher to the Nine-Tailed Kitsune. Tsuwabukimaru dresses and acts like a ninja, attacking with two sharp blades attached to his arms and moves along with the wind. Despite his male name, it is suggested that the skull he uses to take human form may be that of a girl, as N≈´bƒì teased Tamamo about him when he showed up. His personality, while straightforward and determined, is also slightly naive and ditzy. Mountain Y≈çkai In the northern Tohoku region of Japan, there exists a collection of various y≈çkai associated with the local elemental natures of their region, such as rock, wind, snow and ice. The guardian of these y≈çkai is a powerful mountain god whose word regarding his spirit is law, dominating them and forcing them to either obey or face the consequences. These beings have a detached nature from humanity, carrying a cold, emotionless existence similar to the cold winds that blow in their region: they merely exist alongside humans and the fate of these humans are determined by their whims. However, the nature between these mountain yokai and humans would eventually be challenged by one yuki-onna and the man that she loves... =Yukime= One of several y≈çkai from the mountains of northern Japan, Yukime („ÇÜ„Åç„ÇÅ/Èõ™Âß´) is a 16-year old yuki-onna whose life was complicated due to her love for N≈´bƒì. The connection was originally made five years prior, when Nube gets lost while skiing and saves her from a hunter determined to kill her before she grows up to harm his village. Yukime promises that she will eventually find him so they could be together \\"in eternal love\\". The meaning of this was eventually made clear when she came down to Doumori, intent on taking him home frozen in ice \\"for eternity\\". She still has a warm heart, however, so she is convinced that he shouldn't be taken to the mountains thanks to the efforts of N≈´bƒì's students; when she tried to attack them, N≈´bƒì tells her to leave, but she returns to work as an ice skating coach at the local skating rink and tries to win his heart. Yukime possesses several powers and weaknesses due to her connections with snow, ice and the cold. Yukime's main ability is the creation of snow or ice from her body, using it as a means to freeze any target she can see or point at. Her freezing power is useful in offensive attacks, the creation of roadblocks to stop larger targets, and even can be used to concentrate light like a magnifying glass. (not to mention it is useful for making shaved ice, which according to N≈´bƒì is the only good thing Yukime's power is for) Yukime also possesses a slight healing ability and, due to her cold connections, has a natural talent for figure skating. Being a snow y≈çkai has its weaknesses: she can not stand intense heat. Furthermore, Yukime can not make hot foods nor can she wear certain black clothing for fear of melting certain parts of her body. But Yukime does have a cute remedy for temperature problems: when she becomes too hot, she wraps her entire body into a snowman to cool herself down, and can drive N≈´bƒì crazy when she pops out of it‚Ä¶ completely naked. While many of these heat problems were eventually remedied through a revival later in the series, Yukime does occasionally still have problems with hotter temperatures. While Yukime becomes a valuable ally and nuisance in Doumori, it is her relationship with N≈´bƒì that drives most of her character through the series. After her first appearance, she eventually has a love/hate relationship with the teacher, with several of her attempts to get N≈´bƒì to fall for her leading to some acknowledgment, but further frustration for both of them. Making matters worse is beautiful and ultra-sensitive Ritsuko-sensei, whom N≈´bƒì originally desires and whom eventually begins to return some of her feelings just as Yukime is starting to get through to him. Yukime is tricked into capturing the teacher, believing that the sacrifice of Ritsuko is needed to make her human. However she cannot kill Ritsuko through pity; it is a test to see if she still possesses a cold yuki-onna's heart. N≈´bƒì finally saves them both, apologizing to her and admitting his love for the latter. It is too late, however, as a severely injured Yukime uses the last of her powers to help destroy the youkai and turns into snowflakes in N≈´bƒì's arms. While N≈´bƒì believes her to be dead, her snowflakes are carried away to her mountains, where the Mountain god uses them to create another yuki-onna in her place, with exactly the same looks and exactly the same name. This Yukime, however, has a cold heart and does not hesitate to kill. N≈´bƒì finds her during a school trip, where she tricks him away from his class in order to kill him. He allows her to attack him, but not without invoking Yukime's memories. Confused, the \\"new\\" Yukime flees. Yukime returned to Doumori later to find closure to her conflicting feelings, and realizing she did love N≈´bƒì, decided to stay and reconcile the two halves of herself. Although she did not remember much of her life before, it was implied that Yukime eventually recovered all of her memories. Her personality was also changed from the aggressive yuki-onna youkai to a balance between her childish former self and assertive new identity. The last chapter of the manga features N≈´bƒì and Yukime's Wedding, while originally in a normal Japanese wedding company's location, N≈´bƒì was delayed by a y≈çkai and cannot meet the time of the ceremony. They decided to hold the ceremony with Yukime creating a chapel of ice on the playground in the primary school N≈´bƒì teaches and instead of a Catholic priest, the recurring character Buddhist priest in the series held the position instead. In the anime, there was an alternate world created in Kyouko's dreams and subconscious, created by a youkai that had possessed her in her sleep. In that alternate world, Yukime had grown into a full-fledged yuki-onna and still was at Doumori, but she wasn't with N≈´bƒì anymore since he was in a catatonic state after being almost murdered by another youkai. (note: although the chapter existed in the manga, Yukime was not in the original chapter since she had yet to return to D≈çmori at this time) Voiced by: Yuri Shiratori Played by: Kang Ji-young =The Mountain God= The kami of an unnamed mountain in an unnamed province that was Yukime's birthplace. He is her creator, a being of nature that is outside of human understanding. His greatest priority is the balance of nature, which caused him to grow displeased at Yukime's intention to live in the human world with N≈´bƒì. As far as he was concerned, Yukime was created to bring snow and balance to the mountain's winters, and taking her away disrupts that balance. Nothing else matters in the equation. The Mountain God sent servants after her, but after they were all defeated by N≈´bƒì, his displeasure grew in a more grotesque form ---namely by causing the people in nearby villages to grow tree branches all over their skin. Yukime and N≈´bƒì attempted to placate him failed, and they would have died in the Mountain God's wrath if not for N≈´bƒì's father, who used himself as a human pillar to seal away the kami's anger and allow his son to finally live a happy life. The Mountain God's appearance is that of a gigantic human face and hands on a large rock cliff. Trees grow above him and pools of magma bubbles beneath him. Voiced by: Hisao Egawa =Servants of the Mountain God= After Yukime disobeys his orders regarding the pursuit of N≈´bƒì, the Mountain God sends several other yokai of the mountain after her and her beloved, each one using a different tactic to separate the two. * Ippon Datara (‰∏ÄÊú¨„ÉÄ„Çø„É© Ippon Datara): A yokai with the appearance of a disfigured, one-legged monk, he comes to Yukime stating that the only way that she can ever gain the love of a human is to become one by freezing the body of a beautiful woman. (who in this case turns out to be Ritsuko-sensei) Using the power of his one- eye, he abducts the female teacher, leaving her slightly frozen for Yukime to finish the job. But his true intention was to have her kill in order for her to regain the cold heart she had lost, thus becoming a true yuki-onna again and allowing her to rejoin the Mountain God. Yukime releases Ritsuko-sensei, but Datara freezes her and stabs her with icicles for her betrayal. Eventually, while N≈´bƒì and Yukime were able to defeat him, she had been too worn down by the assassin to last too much longer...though when she fades away, she finally does have N≈´bƒì's acknowledgement of his love. * Kodama Mice („Åì„Å†„Åæ„Å≠„Åö„Åø Kodama Nezumi): Originally from Akita Prefecture, these small spies sneak in to Yukime's satchel after she returns to Doumori following her revival. Watching Yukime until the time was right, they have the ability to inflate themselves like balloons until they ultimately burst, killing anyone that has broken the law of the Mountain God. Though they nearly wipe out Yukime, N≈´bƒì and his class, he is able to save everyone with a well-timed sutra prior to explosion. * Tsulala („Å§„Çâ„Çâ Tsulala): Although she appears like a mature, buxom black-haired woman, she is actually Yukime's identical twin sister. In their youth, the two of them spent plenty of time together, but Tsulala consistently played practical jokes on the white-haired yuki-onna which consistently made her get reformed or shredded into snowflakes. But when she appears before her sister and Nube, it is as a messenger from the Mountain God sent to either take her back peacefully or kill her, believing she will only bring bad luck to N≈´bƒì if she stays with humans. Tsulala's own abilities allows her to manipulate ice, but her specialty is to create ice copies of any object she sees and use it like a living, working model. (including machines and animals) In the end, Yukime defeats her by creating a giant ice magnifying glass, weakening her ice abilities to the point of being unusable. (but unlike the other messengers, Tsulala does get away) * The Stone Tengu (Â≤©Â§©Áãó Iwatengu): An extremely powerful yokai completely made of stone, he is the very last and strongest of the servants of the Mountain God, pursuing N≈´bƒì long after his master had been destroyed. After N≈´bƒì and Yukime finally get engaged, he pursues the potential groom the day before and of his wedding, creating illusions with his \\"Anxiety Wind\\" to make the teacher realize the horrors of marrying a yuki-onna. Making N≈´bƒì experience a sleepless night, he nearly drives him to his death...until the power of Baki (the Oni no Te, by this time working alongside the teacher better) saves his life. Although the tengu further increases his wind powers by increasing his nose's length and even unleashes the ultimate wind abilities, he is ultimately crushed when Baki is fully released, as N≈´bƒì realizes that he can live happily ever after with a yuki-onna. =Yukibe= Yukibe was a child who looked like a mixture between Yukime and N≈´bƒì, whom everyone assumed was caused by their union. His real origin, however, was solely based on Yukime's powers. Apparently, as a yuki- onna reaches maturity, she develops a power to create a snow-child (Yuki- Warashi) who would play with her before flying off into the mountains, a way she brings winter to the world. Yukibe possessed the freezing power that Yukime has, and he caused a great deal of havoc before finally flying off, bringing snow to Doumori. Although this is Yukibe's only real appearance, N≈´bƒì consistently is reminded of him whenever he imagines the idea of him and Yukime having a real child, giving him further disgust over the relationship between a human and a yuki-onna. Voiced by Chika Sakamoto Other Y≈çkai While many, many y≈çkai appear within N≈´bƒì either as threats or assistance to the class and the citizens of Doumori, certain ones has multiple appearances and a consistent connection with the characters in the series. =Zashiki Warashi= Zashiki Warashi (Â∫ßÊï∑„Çè„Çâ„Åó) is a small, child like y≈çkai known for being a bringer of good luck towards anyone that is even near it. Merely being within its reach gives a bit of luck to a person, but befriending it can allow it to follow you around giving luck to you for much longer periods. Usually she can not be seen by normal people, though. N≈´bƒì initially encounters this y≈çkai after having a particularly lucky streak at a pachinko parlor. (though it is unknown if it was the cause of his good fortune; though it s suggested he was using his powers to win) After feeding it some senbei, it follows him back to school where it causes one good thing after another for the students in his class (even Hiroshi gets an 80 on his test because of it, which is good considering how non-booksmart to the point of idiocy he is) He tries to convince the y≈çkai that they don't need it, scaring it away, but it returns to end up saving Hiroshi from a possibly fatal accident. In another incident, Zashiki Warashi reveals a power of reversing fortunes, making the yuki-onna Yukime become befuddled by disasters, the worst of which was witnessing a date between her beloved N≈´bƒì and Ritsuko-sensei. Zashiki Warashi's last major appearance revealed that there was more to the y≈çkai than originally suggested. She was revealed to be the dead spirit of a poor young girl who lived fifty years ago. The girl cared more about others and helped them out even though she had so little. She eventually caught pneumonia and chose to wish for the health and happiness of everyone around her instead of herself even as she laid on her deathbed. N≈´bƒì and his class chose to give thanks to Zashiki Warashi for all it did, holding it a party for all its done for them and even allowing her to see her mother one more time. But even so, Zashiki Warashi's work is never done. =Kuchisake-onna= The Kuchisake-onna (Âè£Ë£Ç„ÅëÂ•≥) is a legendary y≈çkai of strange circumstances, even in the world of N≈´bƒì. Some legends say that she is the result of horrific dental surgery from 80 years ago, giving her a gaping mouth and jagged teeth. She wanders around various towns with bandages hiding her mouth, asking children if she's pretty before removing them and scaring them away. In actuality, the Kuchisake-onna is the result of an animal possession, the result of an encounter with the grudge of an inugami giving this female their demonic-appearing mouth. The students of N≈´bƒì's class encounter a kuchisake-onna after hearing the former legend, trying to fend themselves off with pomade to escape it. But the teacher is able to show them their error, using the Oni no Te to remove the spirit and show the beautiful female underneath the beast. This one particular kuchisake- onna (her name revealed later as Honomi) is later revealed to be the youngest of three kuchisake-sisters, all of whom live together and occasionally get into trouble due to their infamy and connection with the legends behind their mouths. =Hayame= Hayame (ÈÄüÈ≠ö) is a sweet but extremely ditsy mermaid who occasionally assists N≈´bƒì...even though he usually ends up regretting it. She usually takes one of two forms when she appears: either that of a typical mermaid (nude with her long green hair covering her bosom and an orange fin on the bottom) or in a human form which she can access by magically turning her fin into two human legs (the formation of legs usually has her revealing her privates after transformation, much to the embrassment of any male that happens to be near her at the time). Like the mermaids of Japanese legend, she has the ability to grant immortality to anyone who eats her flesh, as well as the ability to reverse the same immortality from someone who eats her liver. Similarly, her blood also has healing properties: one small drip can instantly heal anyone of all of their wounds, even fatal ones. But there is a small drawback to Hayame's healing properties: the receiver of her healing blood is rendered a complete idiot for a short period of time after being healed. Also, Hayame possesses the ability to control and manipulate people's emotions by singing, similar to the mythical sirens. Hayame actually came to become connected to N≈´bƒì by strange circumstances: introduced as the mummified corpse of a mermaid possessed by the priest Osh≈ç, the teacher ends up giving it some of the spiritual power of his Oni no Te in when the idiot priest forces him to try and revive it. Though the project seemed a failure after N≈´bƒì spent thirty minutes giving it spiritual energy, the corpse did revive overnight and the awakened female chose to thank the teacher by giving him the gift of immortality. When N≈´bƒì did meet the living Hayame, he thought she was a crazy overworked student who was losing her mind due to cram school. When he finally realized the truth, he apologized and discovered that she was mummified after being away from the sea for two hundred years after coming ashore for a festival. He subsequently declines her immortality offer, but ends up having his life saved by her after nearly killing himself to save a child. Although Hayame finally returns to the sea after this incident, she consistently drops in to D≈çmori one way or another, leading to N≈´bƒì getting stuck with her time and again. Many of her actions ends up making her look like a juvenile teenager instead of the long-lived y≈çkai she is. She ends up getting caught by scientists when she just wants to buy a CD player and even wanted to use her singing abilities to get on a local talent show. But even with her faults, Hayame continues to show a caring, helpful personality that chooses to assist those in need. (even if it does sometimes screw everything up) Voiced by: Wakana Yamazaki =Kudagitsune= The kudagitsune („Åè„Å†Áãê) are small, long animal y≈çkai known from the Tohoku region who live in tubes and are commonly used as the assisting y≈çkai of itako such as local spiritualist Izuna Hazuki. Unseen by average humans, they are able to fly about doing the task of the one who controls them, whether it is investigating information for the user, communication or to fly inside a human's body to gather needed thoughts. All kudagitsune are usually under the control of whomever it is born to or raised by, but can be easily controlled by beings of greater power. Tamamo, for example, is able to stop or control them due to being much simpler animal y≈çkai than himself. Most of the kudagitsune within N≈´bƒì belong to Izuna, who uses them as both her help and servants. Keeping hundreds of them within her own apartment of various shapes and sizes, they end up cleaning up and looking after her until they are needed. Those that Izuna keeps for duty are kept in small lipstick vials which she releases for the need of herself or for others. Another user of kudagitsune include N≈´bƒì himself, who ends up creating one named Baco when the energies of one kudagitsune combined with the energy of the Oni no Te, giving birth to a demonic-appearing y≈çkai that assists the teacher when not living inside a pen. Other kudagitsune are used by the villainous Priest Kanran, who keeps several kudagitsune on him including his most powerful one in his left eye-socket. The most powerful and legendary of the kudagitsune within the series is Gedo, a giant, but slightly dumb being with immense potential for power. Born once every three-hundred years in the heart of a mountain in Tohoku, he has the ultimate potential of releasing the \\"True Treasure\\" of whatever your greatest desire is. The giant kudagitsune unexpectedly ends up in the hands of Izuna, who ends up giving birth to him and forced to protect it from the evil Kanran, who desires the treasure that Gedo may unlock. =Kesaran Pasaran= Although it appears at first like a small white fuzzball, Kesaran Pasaran („Ç±„Çµ„É©„É≥„Éë„Çµ„É©„É≥) is an extremely useful and lucky y≈çkai to whoever encounters it. Unknown in its origin (though one legend suggests it as a gift from angels), Kesaran Pasaran is notable for bringing good luck and happiness to anyone who encounters it. More intriguingly, the amount of the small fuzzballs can quickly multiply if kept within the vicinity of face powder for a period of time: the more Kesaran Pasaran, the more good luck, The y≈çkai is initially encountered by Miki during a Christmas party, who initially uses its luck abilities and its multiplication trick to grant all her desires, but ultimately ends up saving her friends and giving a happy holiday to the entire town in the process. Later on, the Kesaran Pasaran are revealed to be the \\"y≈çkai of ultimate good\\", saving both the town of D≈çmori, and ultimately the world, from the unleashed power of the ultimate evil y≈çkai: Yamato no Orochi.

He was a patron of the Dutch philosopher Erasmus and a brother of the Habsburg diplomat Ferry Carondelet. Life Jan Cornelisz. Vermeyen (Dutch, 1500-1559). Portrait of Jean de Carondelet, ca. 1530. Oil on panel. Brooklyn Museum The second son of jurist Jan I Carondelet, he studied Canon Law and Roman Law in his city of birth. He had a brother named Claude I Carondelet and a nephew named Claude II Carondelet. He entered a religious life in 1493, starting his renowned career as dean of the University of Franche-Comt√© in Besan√ßon. In 1497 he became councillor of the Great Duchal Council of Philip the Fair. In 1504 he became clerical councillor of the newly created Great Council of Mechelen. Finally in 1508 he was made member of the Secret Council, the highest government institution of the Burgundian Netherlands. Prince Charles's mother, Juana of Castile was insane, and his aunt Archduchess Margaret of Austria, the regent of the Burgundian Netherlands, was his guardian. Prince Charles became acquainted with Jean Carondelet through his brother Ferry, who was the confessor to Margaret of Austria. Jean Carondelet soon became a close advisor to Prince Charles, and in 1517-1519, after Charles had assumed the Spanish throne, Jean Carondelet accompanied him to Spain as a member of his privy council. In 1522 Charles named him chairman of the Secret Council. In this function he formed, together with Archduchess Margaret of Austria, the center of Burgundian control over the Low Countries. After the death of the regentes in 1530, Jean, together with Antoine I de Lalaing led the government of the Burgundian Netherlands until Mary of Austria was appointed as the next regentes. When Charles V put through thorough reforms of the governmental institutions in 1531 (such as the creation of the so-called Collateral Councils), Carondelet managed to retain his position: he remained head of the Secret Council and became chairman of the Council of State in Brussels. Until his resignation in 1540, he remained a central figure in the government of the Burgundian Netherlands. Numerous profitable functions Through the influence of the landlords, Carondelet was able to rise in the church hierarchy without much effort. In 1519 he was named archbishop of Palermo, which also included the primacy of Sicily, a function he kept until his death. The fact that he never visited the archbishopric, and never put a foot on Sicilian soil, did not prevent him from receiving the numerous revenues connected to the bishopric. In 1520 he became provost in the St. Donatian's Cathedral in Brugge, one of the richest benefices of the church in the Low Countries. Other functions he filled included provost of Sint- Walburgis in Veurne and provost of Sint-Piatus in Seclin, as well as canon of the Sint-Guidochurch in Anderlecht; and he succeeded his brother Ferry Carondelet as abbot of Montbeno√Æt. The cumulation of all these functions brought him a large income. He erected a large building, the Hof van Palermo, in the Zakstreet in Mechelen, where he died in 1545. Carondelet's wealth and influences enabled him to build up an extensive patronage. He was very generous to his friends, among whom was Erasmus. Painters including Jan van Scorel, Bernard van Orley and Jan Gossaert received commissions from him. His region of birth, Franche-Comt√©, also profited from his generosity, specifically the cathedral of Besan√ßon and the collegiate church of D√¥le. Tomb Carondelet was buried in St. Donatian's Cathedral in Bruges under an impressive monument, part of which is still extant, and can be seen in St. Salvator's Cathedral.

After the break-up of Standard Oil Trust, Van Dyke led the debt-ridden Atlantic Refining Company into expanded markets and sales of more than $131 million. The early years John Wesley Van Dyke was born in Franklin County, Pennsylvania in 1849. In 1867, at the age of 17, young Van Dyke ran away from home to find a job in the western Pennsylvania oil fields. By the age of 21, he was a driller, tool dresser, and small producer, having purchased two oil leases in Venango County, Pennsylvania. Van Dyke was hired as an engineer by Standard Oil‚Äôs Long Island Refinery in the mid-1870s. In 1879, Standard Oil purchased the Sone & Fleming Refinery in Brooklyn, New York and Van Dyke was made plant manager. Time With Standard Oil Trust John Van Dyke was sent to Lima, Ohio in 1886 to manage the newly formed Solar Refinery. Charged with finding a way to remove the sulfur from Ohio‚Äôs crude oil, John D. Rockefeller teamed Van Dyke with German chemist, Herman Frasch. Frasch successfully devised the necessary chemistry while Van Dyke invented a hollow water-cooled drive shaft for the furnace employed in the recovery of the copper oxide that was necessary to remove the sulfur from the crude oil. Standard Oil transferred John Van Dyke to its Point Breeze Refinery in Philadelphia in 1903. Working together with William Irish, the two men developed the technology for the \\"tower still,\\" which offered greater control over condensation during refining. This technique was considered the industry‚Äôs first complete distillation process, saving millions of dollars annually in refining costs.  Designer of Railroad Tank Cars  In 1902, John Van Dyke was tasked with designing an improved railroad tank car for Standard Oil‚Äôs tank car operating unit, Union Tank Line (UTL). His design, patented September 8, 1903, (US 738259) was for an all steel car without a conventional frame, or center sill. This so-called V-car was thoroughly tested by UTL and its design approved by the (Railroad) Master Car Builders‚Äô Association. However, it was considered radical and was not well received by the railroad industry. Few were built. Sources vary as to the actual number, from as few as \\"about one hundred\\" to as many as two thousand. In response to the V-car‚Äôs poor acceptance, UTL asked John Van Dyke to design a tank car along more conventional lines. This car, later known as the X-car, was patented August 30, 1904 (US 768888). It had a substantial center sill incorporating an anchor, securely riveted to the tank and to the center sill, to prevent the tank from shifting longitudinally in the event of a wreck. The X-car was a success and was built by the thousands for a period of at least ten years.American Car & Foundry builders‚Äô photos, dated May 20. 1914, show newly built X-cars, from ACF lots No. 7391A, B, and C Time With Atlantic Refining When the Sherman Antitrust Act broke up Standard Oil Trust in 1911, John Van Dyke became president of the Atlantic Refining Company. Without the huge integrated operation of the former parent company, Atlantic Refining faced many challenges. The company owned three refineries in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Franklin, Pennsylvania. Its domestic markets were confined to the states of Delaware and Pennsylvania. The company did not own or lease any oil wells, pipe lines, or oil tankers, and though sixty per cent of its business was foreign, it had no foreign sales force; it was several million dollars in debt to its former associates. Van Dyke developed a business plan to expand Atlantic's domestic and foreign markets, but domestic sales came to a halt when the U.S. entered World War I in April 1917. Prior to U.S. involvement in the war, gasoline exports increased to the Allied Forces. As air forces emerged, the demand for aviation grade gasoline grew, and during the time of the U.S. involvement in World War I, fifty percent of the aviation fuel sent abroad was produced at Atlantic's Point Breeze Refinery. After the war, Van Dyke returned to his business plan for expansion. In response to changes in the source areas of crude oil, he focused on building up the fleet of oil tanker ships owned by the company. A second strategy was to produce oil, rather than rely on purchased crude. By the mid-1930s, Atlantic was producing oil in Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico from more than 1,000 domestic oil wells. Atlantic's expansion of foreign markets began with the opening of the company's first foreign office in Paris in the spring of 1919. Six months later, a branch was opened in Italy. In 1923, the company entered the South African market, and by the following year had offices in all of Western Europe, on the north, west and south coasts of Africa, and in South America. In 1926, in partnership with Union Oil Company of California, the company began business in Australia. Van Dyke's Legacy John Van Dyke retired as president of the Atlantic Refining Company in 1927, at which time he became chairman of the board. Prior to the Great Depression, a boom period occurred and Van Dyke took an unpopular stance in restraining Atlantic's growth. Although employee hours were cut, wages were maintained, and the company met all of its obligations, and continued its dividends. On November 20, 1937, an 18,500 ton, welded oil tanker, (the first American-built turbo- electric tanker), was launched at Chester, Pennsylvania, bearing the name of \\"J.W. Van Dyke.\\" Having returned to Philadelphia in poor health from a trip to Brazil, Van Dyke died at the age of 89, in September 1939.Personal Correspondence of Elizabeth M. MacDonell, Collections of the Allen County Historical Society Van Dyke's will created an educational endowment fund for the children of the Atlantic's employees in the amount of $1.5 million. In 1966, Atlantic Refining merged with the Richfield Oil Company of California creating the Atlantic Richfield Company, (ARCO).

The protein product is classified as a glycolipoprotein, having properties of a sugar, fat and protein. It belongs to a family of several lipid transport proteins. Vitellogenin is an egg yolk precursor protein expressed in the females of nearly all oviparous species including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, most invertebrates, and monotremes. Vitellogenin is the precursor of the lipoproteins and phosphoproteins that make up most of the protein content of yolk. In the presence of estrogenic endocrine disruptive chemicals (EDCs), male fish can express the Vg gene in a dose dependent manner. Vg gene expression in male fish can be used as a molecular marker of exposure to estrogenic EDCs. Function Vitellogenin precursors provide the major egg yolk proteins that are a source of nutrients during early development of egg-laying (oviparous) vertebrates and invertebrates. Vitellogenin is the precursor of the lipoproteins and phosphoproteins that make up most of the protein content of yolk. More specifically, the N-terminal domain functions as a signal peptide which helps export. Vitellogenin precursors are multi-domain apolipoproteins (proteins that bind to lipids to form lipoproteins), that are cleaved into distinct yolk proteins. Different vitellogenin precursors exist, which are composed of variable combinations of yolk protein components; however, the cleavage sites are conserved. Components In vertebrates, a complete vitellogenin is composed of: * an N-terminal signal peptide for export, * and four regions that can be cleaved into yolk proteins, these are: ** lipovitellin-1, ** phosvitin, ** lipovitellin-2, ** von Willebrand factor type D domain (YGP40). N-terminal lipid transport domain This particular domain represents a conserved region found in several lipid transport proteins, including vitellogenin, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and apolipoprotein B-100. Vesicle trafficking This particular domain, the Vitellogenin lipid transport domain, is also found in the Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) and in Apolipoprotein B. It aids cell trafficking and export of cargo. =Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP)= Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) is an endoplasmic reticulum lipid transfer protein involved in the biosynthesis and lipid loading of apolipoprotein B. MTTP is also involved in the late stage of CD1d trafficking in the lysosomal compartment, CD1d being the MHC I-like lipid antigen presenting molecule. =Apolipoprotein B= Apolipoprotein B can exist in two forms: B-100 and B-48. Apolipoprotein B-100 is present on several lipoproteins, including very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL), and can assemble VLDL particles in the liver. Apolipoprotein B-100 has been linked to the development of atherosclerosis. Human proteins containing this domain  APOB ()Kumar V, Butcher SJ, √ñ√∂rni K, Engelhardt P, Heikkonen J, et al.

The fat bodies apparently act as a food storage reservoir. The glycolipoprotein vitellogenin has additional functionality as it acts as an antioxidant to prolong Queen bee and forager lifespan as well as a hormone that affects future foraging behavior. The health of a honey bee colony is dependent upon the vitellogenin reserves of the nurse bees ‚Äì the foragers having low levels of vitellogenin. As expendable laborers, the foragers are fed just enough protein to keep them working their risky task of collecting nectar and pollen. Vitellogenin levels are important during the nest stage and thus influence honey bee worker division of labor. A nurse bee's vitellogenin titer that developed in the first four days after emergence, affects its subsequent age to begin foraging and whether it preferentially forages for nectar or pollen. If young workers are short on food their first days of life, they tend to begin foraging early and preferentially for nectar. If they are moderately fed, they forage at normal age preferentially for nectar. If they are abundantly fed, immediately after emergence, their vitellogenin titer is high and they begin foraging later in life, preferentially collecting pollen. Pollen is the only available protein source for honey bees. Juvenile hormone feedback loop For the majority of the investigated insect species it has been documented that juvenile hormone stimulates the transcription of the vitellogenin genes and the consequent control of vitellogenin production (cf. Engelmann, 1983; Wyatt and Davey, 1996). The vitellogenin expression is part of a regulatory feedback loop that enables vitellogenin and juvenile hormone to mutually suppress each other. Vitellogenin and juvenile hormone likely work antagonistically in the honey bee to regulate the honey bees development and behavior. Suppression of one leads to high titers of the other. It is likely that the balance between vitellogenin and juvenile hormone levels is also involved in swarming behavior. Juvenile hormone levels drop in honey bee colonies pre-swarming and it is expected that vitellogenin levels would therefore rise. One may surmise, that swarming bees would want to pack along as much vitellogenin as possible to extend their lifespan and to be able to quickly build a new nest.  Evolution  Vertebrates started off with a single copy of the vitellogenin gene, and the bird-mammalian and amphilian lineages each experienced duplications that gave rise to the modern genes. With the exception of monotremes, mammals have all their vitellogenin genes turned into pseudogenes, although the region syntenic to bird VIT1-VIT2-VIT3 can still be found and aligned.

Introduction Sunningdale School is a small school that seeks to educate its pupils in a range of subjects and disciplines, and to encourage them to take the Common Entrance Examination for entry to senior independent boarding schools. In previous decades, many former pupils have gone on to some of Britain's independent schools, including Eton College, Harrow School, Shrewsbury School, Radley College, Winchester College, Sherborne School, Marlborough College, Wellington College and Charterhouse. Founded in 1874 by Canon William Girdlestone, it stands in of gardens and grounds. He was later joined by his son, Mr Girdlestone, who helped run the school for the next quarter of a century. By 1900, when the school was sold to the next headmaster, Mr Crabtree (1900‚Äì33), the pupils numbered 27. Since its foundation, the school has had only seven heads. The school was the subject of a BBC television documentary, Britain's Youngest Boarders, first broadcast in September 2010. Background The school has its own chapel, and a house in Normandy, France to which each boy goes for a week three times during his time at Sunningdale. The school's major sports are football, rugby union and cricket in the Michaelmas, Lent and summer terms respectively. Boys also play tennis, squash, Eton Fives, basketball, indoor hockey, golf and table tennis against other schools. Fives has been played at Sunningdale since at least 1892 and the school has 3 courts on site. They also compete in athletics, cross-country, fencing, judo and air rifle shooting. There is a heated indoor swimming pool which means that the boys can swim all year round. The sports hall includes two full-length cricket nets and an air rifle range. There is also a 7-hole golf course in the grounds. Boys can also ride and do clay pigeon shooting and in their last term they do an outward bound course on Dartmoor. Indoor activities include chess, model railway, cooking, bridge, snooker, Scottish dancing, drama, model making and board games. Former pupils Former pupils of Sunningdale School include: * Henry Blofeld, BBC cricket commentator * Michael Bowes-Lyon, 18th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne * Sir Henry Cecil, horse racing trainer * Guy Clark, Lord Lieutenant of Renfrewshire * John Crichton, Viscount Crichton, property consultant * Henry Field, US anthropologist who documented Iraq's Marsh Arabs * Francis Fulford, TV personality, reality star of The F***ing Fulfords * Bamber Gascoigne, British television presenter and author * Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster, the former richest aristocrat in the UK * Carey Harrison, novelist and dramatist * Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol * Bernard Heywood, Church of England bishop * Nick Hurd, Government Minister * Prince Michael of Kent, cousin of the Queen and member of the Royal Family * Lord Frederick Windsor, British Royal and financial analyst * William Kinghan, unionist politician, High Sheriff of Down, 1924 * Humphrey Lyttelton, jazz musician and BBC radio presenter * Ferdinand Mount, writer and novelist * Ian Ogilvy, actor * Stephen Powys, 6th Baron Lilford * Hugh van Cutsem, landowner, banker, businessman, and horse-breeder References External links  * Sunningdale School website Category:Boys' schools in Berkshire Category:Boarding schools in Berkshire Category:Educational institutions established in 1874 Category:Preparatory schools in Berkshire Category:1874 establishments in England Category:Independent schools in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead ","title":"Sunningdale School"},{"id":"4449271","title":"Bree Turner"},{"id":"4449277","text":"Mount Vernon High School building Mount Vernon High School is a public high school in the Fairfax County Public Schools system located in Mount Vernon, Virginia. History The former Mount Vernon High School building, seen in 2018.Originally constructed to take the place of the Lee-Jackson High School, Mount Vernon High school first opened in November 1939. With the opening of the school, Lee-Jackson principal G. Claude Cox moved to Mount Vernon, becoming the school's first principal, and Lee-Jackson became an elementary school. In 1945, Principal Cox resigned to become principal of Wythe High School in Wytheville, Virginia, and Lee-Jackson principal Melvin B. Landes moved to Mount Vernon to begin a nearly thirty-year tenure there.This reference incorrectly states that Landes was principal of Lee-Jackson Elementary School in Mathews, Virginia. Landes was principal of Lee-Jackson Elementary in Alexandria. The school's current location was built in 1961 as Walt Whitman Intermediate School. In 1973, Mount Vernon and Whitman swapped facilities, and the former intermediate school was enlarged to serve its new role as a high school. The original Mount Vernon High School continued to operate as the Walt Whitman Intermediate School until 1985, when Whitman was moved to the former Stephen Foster Intermediate School. Also in 1973, Principal Melvin Landes retired, and Thomas G. Hyer took over as Principal. Following the departure of Eric Brent to become principal at Forest Park High School in Woodbridge, Nardos King became the principal of MVHS in 2006. After nine years as principal, Nardos King resigned in 2015 to take a position as Assistant Superintendent of High Schools with the Baltimore County Public Schools system. Assistant Principal Esther Manns became the interim principal of MVHS in September 2015. In February 2016, Rocky Run Middle School Principal Dr. Anthony S. Terrell was announced as the principal of Mount Vernon High School, beginning in March. The original Mount Vernon High School is still standing on Richmond Highway; it became a school for Islamic students, the Islamic Saudi Academy, which moved to the facility in 1989. This school closed in 2016. Academic achievement Students with individual needs are accommodated through special education programs, including English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) program, and advanced placement and International Baccalaureate programs. Mount Vernon is an accredited, high school. The average SAT score in 2013 for Mount Vernon was a 1417 (479 in Critical Reading, 474 in Math, and 464 in Writing). Demographics For the 2014-15 school year, Mount Vernon High School's student body was 37.80% Hispanic, 29.56% Black, 20.91% White, 6.36% Asian and 5.37% Other. Athletics School athletic programs feature fall, winter and spring sports, including cheerleading, cross country, field hockey, football, golf, volleyball, basketball, gymnastics, swimming, wrestling, baseball, crew, lacrosse, softball, soccer, tennis, track and intramural sports. In Mount Vernon's history, it has garnered five AAA State Championship titles. They won their first title in 1979, in basketball, their second in 1983, for football, their third in 2008 for the swim & dive team, and a fourth in 2013, for soccer, as well as one for wrestling.

A prolific and highly original composer, Kapsberger is chiefly remembered today for his lute and theorbo (chitarrone) music, which was seminal in the development of these as solo instruments. Life Nothing is known about Kapsberger's date and place of birth. His father Colonel Wilhelm (Guglielmo) von Kapsperger was a military official of the Imperial House of Austria, and may have settled in Venice, the city which may have been Kapsberger's birthplace. After 1605 Kapsberger moved to Rome, where he quickly attained a reputation as a brilliant virtuoso. He cultivated connections with various powerful individuals and organizations; and himself organized \\"academies\\" in his house, which were counted among the \\"wonders of Rome\\". Around 1609 Kapsberger married Gerolima di Rossi, with whom he had at least three children. He started publishing his music at around the same time, with more than a dozen collections of music appearing during the next ten years. These included the celebrated Libro I d'intavolatura di lauto (1611), Kapsberger's only surviving collection of music for lute.Coelho, Grove. In 1624 Kapsperger entered the service of Cardinal Francesco Barberini, where he worked with numerous important composers (such as Girolamo Frescobaldi and Stefano Landi) and poets (which included Giulio Rospigliosi, the future Pope Clement IX). Kapsberger worked in Francesco's household until 1646. He died in 1651. Works Title page of Kapsberger's Libro primo d'intavolatura di lauto, the only surviving collection of his works for lute, depicting the von Kapsberger coat of arms Kapsberger is best remembered as a composer for lute and theorbo. At least six collections were published during his lifetime, two of which are currently lost. Kapsberger's writing is characterized, especially in toccatas, by spontaneous changes, sharp contrasts, unusual rhythmic groupings and, sometimes, passages that do not conform to the rules of counterpoint that were in use at the time. The vast majority of contemporary critics praised Kapsberger's compositional skill and innovations. Among them was Athanasius Kircher, who described Kapsberger as a \\"superb genius\\" and attested that he has \\"successfully penetrated the secrets of music.\\"Cited in: Paul O'Dette, liner notes to \\"Baroque Lute Music. Volume 1: Giovanni Girolamo Kapsberger\\", 1990/2001. Harmonia Mundi HMG507020 One notable exception was the critic Giovanni Battista Doni, who was initially supportive of the composer, but then turned against him for unclear reasons and criticised his music in print.Coelho, liner notes, p. 13. Some contemporaries, such as Stefano Landi, mentioned that Kapsberger was not as meticulous a composer as he was as a performer. The features listed above led some modern scholars to share this view and they tend to believe that Kapsberger was a composer of inferior ability. Prominent among these critics is lutenist Rolf Lislevand: in his words, \\"Kapsberger was as bad a composer as he was a fine instrumentalist [...] The ideas are often badly developed, and are freely associated with one another; no real musical discourse is built up [...] the rhythm‚Äîeven after serious efforts at fathoming it‚Äîwavers between inspired cleverness and total confusion.\\"Rolf Lislevand, liner notes to \\"Johann Hieronimus Kapsberger: Libro Quarto d'Intavolatura di Chitarone\\", 1993. Auvidis/Astr√©e AS 128515 Regardless of how one regards his compositional prowess, Kapsberger was one of the principal composers of lute and theorbo music during the early Baroque era (together with Alessandro Piccinini) and greatly contributed towards advancing European plucked string instruments of the time. Also, Kapsberger's toccatas may have influenced those of Girolamo Frescobaldi,Robert Judd.

Kapsberger's other music includes two collections of instrumental ensemble dances, rare for the period, and a wealth of vocal music, which was widely performed during his lifetime, but which is now critically less acclaimed. Kapsberger also wrote stage music, almost all currently lost. The only surviving work of this kind is Apotheosis sive Consecratio SS Ignatii et Francisci Xaverii (1622).

The fort was part of a line that included Fort Presque Isle, Fort Le Boeuf, and Fort Duquesne.  Description The fort was built on a hill, 60 yards west of the Allegheny River. The fort was in the form of a parallelogram, about 75 by . The curtain was made of hewed timber, stacked lengthwise. The four corners had bastions in the form of polygons. The bastions were built of saplings, eight inches (203 mm) thick, and in height. The gate fronted the river. Inside the fort were a magazine, several officer's barracks, with two stories and stone chimneys. The soldiers barracks consisted of 45 buildings outside the fort.  History =Establishment In 1753, Governor Jean de Lauson sought to build a fortified trading post at the confluence of the Allegheny River and French Creek at Venango. That year, the English traders were expelled from Venango and Captain Philippe-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire established Fort d'Anjou with a permanent garrison at the location. In December 1753, George Washington used the Venango Path to reach Fort Machault during his first expedition into the Ohio Country. Washington, with an escort of seven men and a letter from Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia, protesting the French invasion of lands claimed by Great Britain and demanding their immediate withdrawal.\\"France in America, Fitzhenry & Whiteside Limited, p. 181 The French officer at the fort said he did not have the power to negotiate with the British. Therefore, he told Washington to go to Fort Le Boeuf instead to meet with a higher-ranking officer. The French and Indian War began on May 28, 1754 with the Battle of Jumonville Glen. Captain Philippe-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire finished building Fort d'Anjou Fort Machault in April 1754. It was named in honor of prominent financier, Jean-Baptiste Machault d'Arnouville, the French Minister of the Marine at the time of its construction. It was also known as \\"Venango,\\" the name of the nearby Delaware Indian village. Captain Philippe-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire was replaced by as the officer in charge of constructing the fort in 1754, which eventually became Fort Machault. Operation One of four forts built by the French and Canadiens, to control the Venango Path between Lake Erie and the Ohio River, Fort Machault was located in modern Franklin, Pennsylvania, at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny River. Fort Machault was the last stop on the supply route from Canada to Fort Duquesne. Prior to the arrival of the French in 1753, Pennsylvania blacksmith and Indian trader John Fraser had set up shop on this site, supplying Indians in the region with trade goods and repairing their guns and other metal wares. His business was an example of the western expansion of Pennsylvania's fur trade that prompted the French to fortify the Ohio Country, for fear of losing trade and influence among the Indians there. Fort Machault Historical Marker In 1756, William Johnson, who had escaped from Native Americans, described the fort as a \\"Captain's command of about 50 men; the Fort of Stockades, very weak, and scarce of provisions . . . \\" In 1758, Colonel Mercer, in a report from Fort Pitt, reported that there were about 100 soldiers at Fort Machault, where the French had 11 flat-bottomed boats called \\"batteaus\\" and a large gun the size of a quart pot \\"which they fire off by a train of powder.\\" After abandoning Fort Duquesne in November 1758, the French fell back to Fort Machault, and the British expected them to launch a counterattack from there in the following campaign season. In July 1759, the French began a campaign to capture Fort Pitt. Nearly a thousand French and Canadiens and a thousand Native Americans mustered at Fort Machault. The British, however, began a siege of Fort Niagara. The fall of Fort Niagara in summer 1759, however, made the French presence in the Ohio Country untenable. The assault on Fort Pitt was abandoned, and available forces were sent to relieve Fort Niagara. On July 25, 1759, the French surrendered Fort Niagara. In August 1759, the commander of Fort Presque Isle sent word to Fort Le Boeuf and Fort Machault to abandon their forts. The French burned Fort Machault to the ground and retreated to Canada in anticipation of a British expedition north from the Forks of the Ohio. In 1760, the British built Fort Venango near this site. This map, from 1879 History of Venango County Pennsylvania, depicts the area where the fort was stationed. This is current-day Franklin, Pennsylvania.

Timon was portrayed through his many appearances by Nathan Lane (in all three films and early episodes of the show), Max Casella (the original actor in The Lion King Broadway musical), Kevin Schon (in certain episodes of the show), Quinton Flynn (in certain episodes of the show), Bruce Lanoil in the Wild About Safety shorts and Kingdom Hearts II, and while Pumbaa is voiced by Ernie Sabella (in all of his traditionally animated speaking appearances), and was portrayed by Tom Alan Robbins in the original cast of the Broadway musical. In the CGI remake, the characters are portrayed by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, respectively. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella first came to audition for the roles of the hyenas, but when the producers saw how well they worked together, they decided to cast them as Timon and Pumbaa. As with many characters in The Lion King, Pumbaa's name derives from the East African language Swahili. In Swahili, pumbaa (v.) means \\"to be foolish, silly, weakminded, careless, negligent.\\"\\"Pumba\\" in Swahili-English Dictionary Timon is one of the few characters whose name has no meaning in Swahili; Timon is a historical Greek name, taken to mean \\"he who respects.\\" Timon's name may derive from Shakespeare's tragedy Timon of Athens, another Shakespeare reference in a film which derives its plot from Hamlet. A more likely explanation is that he is named after the Greek philosopher Timon, a disciple of Pyrrho, the founder of the school of scepticism. Timon is a wise-cracking and self-absorbed meerkat who is known for claiming Pumbaa's ideas as his own. Pumbaa has flatulence issues but is also a fierce warrior, charging into battle like a battering ram, and taking great offense if anyone who's not his friend calls him a pig, at which point he exclaims \\"They call me Mister pig!\\"‚Äîa reference to Sidney Poitier's line \\"They call me Mister Tibbs!\\" from the 1967 film In the Heat of the Night and then screams as he charges. Unlike real meerkats, Timon can walk on his hind legs, while in real life, meerkats walk on all four legs and can only stand on their hind ones. Appearances=The Lion King Based on the characters Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from Hamlet, Timon and Pumbaa are played by Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella. Timon was animated and created by Michael Surrey. They made their first appearances in the 1994 film when they shooed away the vultures that swarmed around young Simba, who had collapsed from heat exhaustion. Timon and Pumbaa then took the collapsed lion cub back to a small pool, where they splashed water on him to wake him up. After Simba is awakened by the two, they introduce themselves and welcome Simba to stay with them and follow their hakuna matata philosophy. At first, Simba is confused about Timon and Pumbaa's lifestyle, but it is explained to him in the song \\"Hakuna Matata\\". Many years later, while out on a musical walk with Timon, Pumbaa is distracted by a bug, which he follows into the jungle. The bug leads him right to a hungry lioness prowling around, who then tries to hunt down Pumbaa. She chases the warthog until Simba springs into action, and the two lions engage in conflict. When the lioness pins Simba, he recognizes her as Nala, his childhood playmate. They are happy to be together, but Timon is jealous after they leave for a night of romance. He and Pumbaa start singing the song \\"Can You Feel The Love Tonight?\\" and are joined by Simba and Nala on their night out. Still, the two help Simba defeat Scar and gain his rightful place as the king of the Pride Lands, most notably when they create a hula distraction to lure away Scar's hyenas. Pumbaa single-handedly drives off Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. They also stand on top of Pride Rock along with Simba and Nala when Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the animals of the Pride Lands. The Lion King II: Simba's Pride It is unclear whether Timon and Pumbaa have taken up residence at Pride Rock, or just make frequent visits. They serve as aides to Simba, and are often called upon to keep an eye on his adventurous daughter Kiara so in a way replacing Zazu's role as babysitters. Despite being bumbling, Simba trusts them to look after Kiara, and does not blame them when Kiara runs off as Kiara is known to do just that. When Kiara goes on her first hunt, they are hired to make sure she won't get hurt. Enraged that Simba broke his promise to let her hunt alone, Kiara escapes from the Pridelands to hunt outside the boundary. Timon and Pumbaa also teach Kovu how to have fun after he forgets due to years of indoctrination in hatred. When Kovu's pride, the Outsiders, turn on Simba and ambush him, Timon is on Simba's side automatically, not even wanting to hear Kovu's argument. They later assist in the battle against Kovu's manipulative and vengeful mother Zira, and the Outsiders, but get chased off and cornered by a group of Outsider lionesses, until Timon threatens to use Pumbaa's tail as a gun and use his gas on them causing them to flee in fear. Despite being slightly cowardly, they are willing to fight for what is right. When Simba tries to make peace with Zira after realizing that both prides \\"were one\\", he uses the same advice Timon and Pumbaa gave him when he was a cub (put the past behind you) showing how much he had learned from his old friends. The Lion King 1¬Ω Timon and Pumbaa are the main characters in this followup, and are revealed to have passed by and caused some key events in the first film before their first appearance. Timon, his mother Ma and Uncle Max were part of a group of meerkats who lived on the savannah, but he was unable to do any job properly, and almost led to the meerkat being eaten by the hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed (Pumbaa was revealed to have blocked out part of the scene by sitting on the remote). Feeling depressed, he received counsel from Rafiki, who taught him the \\"Hakuna Matata\\" philosophy and told him to \\"look beyond what you see.\\" Timon took this literally, and set off to find the ultimate paradise. Along the way, he first encountered Pumbaa, and the two became friends. On the way to find paradise, they passed by the presentation of Simba (it turns out that Pumbaa accidentally passed some gas and the smell made an elephant trumpet and a few animals collapse, causing the other animals to think they were bowing and later they all bowed) and Mufasa was very puzzled at seeing this and his majordomo Zazu then tells him they are bowing to his son; Simba, Nala, and when the animals are singing \\"I Just Can't Wait To Be King\\" (it was Timon who hit an elephant's leg with a stick, causing the pyramid of animals to collapse); the elephant graveyard where Mufasa was on his way to save Simba and Nala from the hyenas (\\"I see carnivores\\"); the hyenas marching to \\"Be Prepared\\" (\\"something tells me this ain't the traveling company of Riverdance\\"); and the wildebeest stampede (\\"Shall we run for our lives?\\" \\"Oh yes, let's.\\"). Finally, they reach a beautiful oasis and are enjoying life until they find a collapsed Simba. After rescuing Simba, Timon and Pumbaa find themselves with their hands full trying to keep up with the mischievous cub. The film also shows more of Simba's life with Timon and Pumbaa before Nala came along, stating that Simba had beaten Timon in every bug-eating contest they had done with one another. Timon and Pumbaa, afraid that Nala would take away their friend, attempted to spoil Simba and Nala's date by letting out bees, a spider, and tripping the two (explaining why they fell down the hill in the first film), but all failed. Later on, they see Simba and Nala quarrelling. They also mistake the appearance of Mufasa's ghost as bad weather (\\"I think the storm is coming to a head\\"). After they realize Simba has gone back to take his rightful place as king, it is revealed that Pumbaa had set off to help Simba before Timon, who was indifferent and reluctant. Timon eventually came to his senses thanks to Rafiki's continued advice, and quickly followed, after which Rafiki says, \\"My work here is done.\\" After the duo provide their hula distraction, they run into Ma and Uncle Max, who had been searching for Timon ever since he left the meerkat colony. Later on during the fight, they defeat the hyenas by digging a massive tunnel network, sending the hyenas down Pride Rock where they get to take revenge on Scar who had betrayed them. This scene explains what happened to Timon and Pumbaa while Simba was fighting Scar. After Scar is killed, Timon and Pumbaa show up alive and unharmed against the hyenas that chased them, suggesting to audiences that they have either outsmarted or beat up the hyenas in the first film. At the end, Timon takes his entire meerkat colony to live in the oasis, free from threats. Despite the appearance of Timon's mother, Ma (who was also given reference in at least one episode of Timon and Pumbaa) and his Uncle Max (believed to be his great uncle due to his age-which may be premature-and the fact that Ma also calls him 'Uncle' Max), Timon's father is never mentioned. However, in deleted scenes, Timon's father is an active character, though he was apparently replaced by Uncle Max. The Lion King (2019) Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen played Timon and Pumbaa (in the first instance of the latter being voiced by somebody other than Sabella) respectively in the 2019 CGI remake of The Lion King. Director Jon Favreau encouraged Rogen and Eichner, who did their voice recordings together, to improvise a lot. Eichner said that \\"It's such a great role that allows you to do so much. But I've learned that the bigger the project and the bigger the names that you're working with, the more you have to ignore it. If you get to the soundstage and you're thinking, 'Oh my God, what a full-circle moment! Nathan Lane did it originally! Beyonc√©'s in this!' then you're paralyzed creatively. You just have to put that out of your head in order to get the job done.\\" Eichner also talked about having \\"what some may consider a gay sensibility\\" that he brought to the table when he voiced Timon. Rogen said that \\"As an actor, I 100 percent don't think I'm right for every role‚Äîthere are a lot of roles I don't think I'm right for even in movies I'm making‚Äîbut Pumbaa was one I knew I could do well. Truthfully, I probably would have been a little insulted if [Favreau] didn't ask me to.\\" Among the movie's vocal performances, Eichner and Rogen received particular praise by critics, with A.V. Clubs A.A. Dowd proclaiming: \\"Ultimately, only Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, as slacker sidekicks Timon and Pumbaa, make much of an impression; their funny, possibly ad-libbed banter feels both fresh and true to the spirit of the characters‚Äîthe perfect remake recipe.\\" The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa Timon and Pumbaa starred in their own animated television series which focuses on their lives. The duo is seen having many adventures in their jungle home, as well as across the globe, such as the United States, Spain, and France. This series also reveals their last names: Timon's is revealed to be Berkowitz while Pumbaa's is revealed to be Smith. It is also shown that Timon and Pumbaa celebrate Bestest Best Friend Day (which, according to Timon, was made up by Pumbaa) to dedicate their friendship. =Timon= It is revealed in the series that before Timon met Pumbaa, he had a best friend named Fred, who is a meerkat who enjoys pulling practical jokes. The episode \\"Isle of Manhood\\" also reveals Timon taking a manhood test in order to prove himself brave and manly. In \\"Timon's Time Togo\\", Timon dies from eating a poisonous bug, but the meerkat angel sends him back to Earth so that he can perform one good deed in order to enter Meerkat Heaven. Timon, however, decides to never again do any good deeds so that he'll never die and leave Pumbaa forever. In another episode \\"The Law of the Jungle\\", Timon breaks the law by touching a forbidden stick. Due to that, he gets sent to a jungle court by the vulture police, where a rhino judge, known as the Wonderful Rhino of Laws, comes up with various tests for Timon to prove his innocence. In \\"Timon...Alone\\", Timon decides to start a new life as a writer and wants to be away from Pumbaa in order to concentrate. He later realizes how lonely he is without Pumbaa and decides to find his friend and quit his new lifestyle as a writer. In another episode \\"Ice Escapades\\", Timon reveals that he dreams of becoming an ice skater and suggests that he and Pumbaa become world's famous ice skating champions. It turns out that Timon is not good at ice skating, but Pumbaa suggests that he keeps trying in order to live out his dream, which he does. In the episode \\"Once Upon a Timon\\", told one of the versions of Timon's backstory was revealed. He lived in a more civilized colony, which was ruled by the Duke Meerkat and his daughter Princess Tatiana, whom Timon had a massive crush on. One day when Timon had guard duty while the Duke was away, he left his post to speak with the princess. While he was gone, a snake invaded the colony and kidnapped Tatiana. As a result, Timon got blamed for abandoning his post and was banned. He soon met and befriended Pumbaa, who was also an outcast. Soon enough, the two came across Tatiana, who was held captive by the snake, and rescued her. When Timon returned to the colony with Pumbaa and Tatiana, he was offered to marry the princess and get the good life, but that would mean leaving Pumbaa. Therefore, he decided to stay with his pal and live a Hakuna Matata life. =Pumbaa= In the episode \\"Russia Hour\\", Pumbaa is shown to have an uncle named Boaris, who is very famous in Russia due to his ballet dancing skills. Just before Boaris' farewell performance, he falls on fish eggs that Timon had thrown on the ground and goes to the hospital, leaving it up to Pumbaa to perform in his uncle's place. Pumbaa, however, breaks his leg and Timon is forced to stall. Boaris, presumably recovered from his injury, shows up and does his final performance. In \\"Sense & Senegambia\\", Pumbaa is also revealed to have a deceased uncle named Ernie, who is likely named after his voice actor. In that same episode, Pumbaa believes he lost his bug-hunting skills after failing to catch and eat a cricket. Timon thinks this is because there is something wrong with the warthog's senses and so he purchases expensive aids for his friend. Pumbaa later learns from his dream of talking to Uncle Ernie that he needs to believe in himself and therefore, he regains his confidences and succeeds in catching bugs. In another episode \\"New Guinea Pig\\", it is shown that Pumbaa's tusks can get in his way of doing some activities or passing through some things. As a result, Pumbaa starts to get tired of them and considers trading them to the three natives. The warthog later realizes how useful his tusks are, as he uses them to free Timon and create an ice replica of himself. Pumbaa learns from Timon that his tusks are the most important parts of what makes Pumbaa who he is. In \\"Animal Barn\\", Pumbaa competes against a domestic pig for the right to be called \\"Mr. Pig\\". In another episode \\"Uganda Be an Elephant\\", upon seeing the respect elephants (particularly Ned) earn, Pumbaa decides to become an elephant himself, with the help of Timon, so that he can become just as popular. He soon learns that he is perfectly happy being a warthog. Also, in the episode \\"Big Jungle Game\\", Pumbaa joins an Olympic jungle game in order to live out his dream. In the episode \\"Home is Where the Hog is\\", it is revealed that Pumbaa was a member of a sounder of warthogs, but by the time he was fully grown, he was banished because of his smell, which was apparently appalling even by warthog standards. Also, years before the episode \\"Madagascar About You\\", an arranged marriage has been set up for Pumbaa before he was even born. The Lion Guard Timon and Pumbaa appear with several of the film's other characters in the Disney Junior series The Lion Guard, which centers around Simba & Nala's second-born cub, Kion. During the series, which is set within the time gap in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, Timon and Pumbaa are adoptive uncles of a young honey badger named Bunga, who is one of the members of the Lion Guard. When Bunga was an infant, he encountered Timon and Pumbaa singing \\"Utamu\\". Instantly smitten, Bunga had begun following them around. Pumbaa wanted to keep Bunga, but Timon didn't want to raise anymore kids since he and Pumbaa have already done so with Simba, but the two friends see that the honey badger wants to be with them as well. Before he accepted Bunga, Timon instructed the honey badger to climb a tree and fetch them some Utamu grubs. When Bunga had succeeded and given the grubs to Timon, the meerkat had allowed him to stay, and the three have lived together ever since. Other appearances An example of Lion King fan artwork - the stencil, which features Pumbaa, is a parody of the Puma logo. Timon and Pumbaa made regular appearances in the animated television series Disney's House of Mouse (2001‚Äì2002) as guests and also appeared in Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse. An occasional running gag in the show involved Timon trying to eat Jiminy Cricket, only to be stopped by Pumbaa. The two have made cameos in other Disney films and TV series. In Aladdin and the King of Thieves, the Genie turns into Pumbaa in a scene saying, \\"Hakuna Matata\\". Timon appears in the Virtual Magic Carpet Ride game included on disc 2 of the 2004 Aladdin Platinum Edition DVD. In Enchanted, Pip accidentally transforms himself momentarily into Pumbaa in the DVD extra \\"Pip's Predicament: A Pop-Up Adventure\\". Pumbaa makes a cameo appearance in the \\"Good Neighbor Cruella\\" episode of 101 Dalmatians: The Series. Both characters make a cameo appearance in the Lilo & Stitch: The Series finale film, Leroy & Stitch, hidden among Stitch's experiment \\"cousins\\" in the climax. In The Jungle Book 2, two animals resembling Timon and Pumbaa can briefly be seen dancing during the song \\"W-I-L-D\\" until Baloo bounces them off with his backside. Timon and Pumbaa, along with a young Simba, appeared on the packaging of the Kellogg's cereal \\"Chocolate Mud & Bugs\\", which was themed around them. Kingdom Hearts Timon and Pumbaa reprise their roles from The Lion King in the 2006 video game Kingdom Hearts II. They charge in to battle the hyenas, and are saved by the game's main protagonists Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy. After Simba's coronation, they fear that Simba will forget them and let the other lions eat them, though Sora assures them that Simba will never forget them. Pumbaa later shows his bravery by standing between a pregnant Nala and Scar's \\"ghost\\". Ernie Sabella reprises his role as Pumbaa, while Timon is voiced by Bruce Lanoil. Coincidentally, Quinton Flynn also had a role in the game, providing the voice for Axel of Organization XIII. Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Timon appears at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts as a meetable character in Adventureland and at Disney‚Äôs Animal Kingdom, while Pumbaa occasionally appears on show or parade floats. At Walt Disney World, the two appear in signage explaining the park's safety policies to visitors. They were similarly featured on the Disney Safety website which was created in conjunction with Animax Entertainment until its closure. Timon and Pumbaa were main characters in The Legend of the Lion King, a defunct Fantasyland attraction in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, which retold the story of the film using fully articulated puppets. The two also make cameo appearances in the Hong Kong Disneyland and the Disneyland versions of It's a Small World. They appeared along with Simba in the film Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable, an edutainment film at Epcot's Land Pavilion that ran from 1995 to 2018. Timon and Pumbaa both feature in Festival of the Lion King at Animal Kingdom, voiced by Kevin Schon and Ernie Sabella. Educational shorts Disney Educational Productions and Underwriters Laboratories co-produced an educational film series called Wild About Safety: Safety Smart with Timon and Pumbaa, where Pumbaa educated Timon on how to stay safe. Ernie Sabella reprised his role as Pumbaa, while Timon was voiced by Bruce Lanoil. The series ran from 2008 to 2013. Each installment is approximately 12 minutes long. They are all animated in the style of the 1995 TV show. The following titles were produced: *Wild About Safety: Safety Smart At Home! (2008) *Wild About Safety: Safety Smart Goes Green!

Like the other major conflicts of the Heian period, such as the Gosannen War and the Genpei War, the Zenkunen war was a struggle for power within the samurai clans. While most provinces were overseen by just a Governor, Mutsu, in what is now the Tohoku region, had a military general in charge of controlling the Emishi natives, who had been subjugated when the Japanese took over the area in the ninth century. Historically, this post was always held by a member of the Abe clan, and there were many conflicts between the Abe general and the Governor over administrative control of the province. In 1050, the general overseeing the Ainu was Abe no Yoritoki, who levied taxes and confiscated property on his own, rarely paying any heed to the wishes of the province's Governor. The Governor sent word to the capital in Kyoto asking for help, and as a result Minamoto no Yoriyoshi was appointed both Governor and commander-in-chief over controlling the natives. He was sent with his son Yoshiie, then age fifteen, to stop Abe. The fighting lasted for twelve years, or nine if one subtracts short periods of ceasefire and peace. Skirmishes were fierce and many, but few major battles were fought until the Battle of Kawasaki in 1057. Abe no Yoritoki had been killed shortly before, and the Minamoto were now fighting his son, Abe no Sadato, who defeated them at Kawasaki and pursued them through a blizzard. The government forces, led by the Minamoto, had much trouble for quite some time, due to the harsh terrain and weather, but were eventually reinforced with new troops, including many offered by the Governor, a member of the Kiyohara clan, of the nearby Dewa province. In 1062, Minamoto no Yoriyoshi, along with his son, led an assault on an Abe fortress at Siege of Kuriyagawa. They diverted the water supply, stormed the earthworks and stockade, and set the fortress aflame. After two days of fighting, Sadato surrendered. Minamoto no Yoshiie is thus considered the founder of the Minamoto clan's great martial legacy, and is worshiped as a particularly special and powerful ancestor kami of the clan. As a kami and a legend, he is often called Hachimantar≈ç, \\"Child of Hachiman, the god of war.\\" A famous renga from the Kokon Chomonj≈´ was exchanged between Sadato and Yoshiie when Sadato was forced to flee his castle on the Koromo River. Yoshiie said, Koromo no tate wa hokorobinikeri, Koromo Castle has been destroyed (\\"The warps of your robe have come undone\\"), to which Sadato replied, toshi o heshi ito no midare no kurushisa ni, \\"over the years its threads became tangled, and this pains me.\\" References Category:11th century in Japan Category:Wars involving Japan Category:1050s conflicts Category:1060s conflicts Category:1060s in Japan Category:1050s in Japan Category:1051 in Asia Category:1063 in Asia ","title":"Former Nine Years' War"},{"id":"4449373","text":"Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club is an 18-hole championship golf course in North West England, situated near the Merseyside (formerly Lancashire) towns of Southport and Ainsdale, north of Liverpool.

With 20 credited aerial victories he was the highest scoring pilot flying the Sopwith Dolphin, and the second highest scoring American, only surpassed by Eddie Rickenbacker. Biography Gillet was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He graduated from the University of Virginia, before joining the Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Signal Corps as a cadet in April 1917. On 31 May 1917 he entered the School of Military Aeronautics at the University of Illinois for preliminary flight training, but obtained an honourable discharge on the grounds of dependency on 25 July 1917. He enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps Canada using the name Frederick Warrington Gillet (though British sources most often render his surname as Gillett) to avoid any complications with 8 U.S. Code ¬ß 1481 which would result in him forfeiting his American citizenship on enlisting in the armed forces of a foreign power. After completing his basic flight training, on 29 December 1917 he received Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 7017, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant the same day. In England, after receiving advanced training as a fighter pilot, he was assigned to No. 79 Squadron RFC in France on 29 March 1918.Franks (2001), p.40 Within days, on 1 April 1918, the Army's Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) were merged to form the Royal Air Force. Sopwith Dolphin No. 79 Squadron was flying the Sopwith Dolphin, an unusual biplane distinguished by its \\"negative stagger\\" wing arrangement, a type Gillet had not flown before. After becoming acclimated to the Dolphin and honing his combat skills, he scored his first victory on 3 August, destroying a kite balloon north of Estaires. He accounted for two aircraft towards the end of the month, then another balloon and six more aircraft in September, a balloon and five aircraft in October, and four aircraft in November, three of them early on the morning of the 10th, the day before the armistice. All were assessed as destroyed, which was extremely unusual, as most aces had numerous \\"out of control\\" credits. He was appointed acting-captain on 14 October 1918, and served for a short time as the commanding officer of his squadron. His decorations include two awards of the British Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Belgian Croix de Guerre. After the war, Gillet left the RAF, being transferred to the unemployed list on 7 March 1919. He returned to the United States and obtained his release from the U.S. Army Signal Reserve Corps and entered the family business. Gillet pursued a successful, lengthy business career as a liquor importer, realtor, and banker, and died at the age of 74 on 21 December 1969 at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center.

The most extensive evaluation of Follow Through data covers the years 1968‚Äì1977; however, the program continued to receive funding from the government until 1995. Follow Through was originally intended to be an extension of the federal Head Start program, which delivered educational, health, and social services to typically disadvantaged preschool children and their families. The function of Follow Through, therefore, was to provide a continuation of these services to students in their early elementary years. In President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1967 state of the union address, he proposed $120 million for the program, to serve approximately 200,000 children from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, when funding for the project was approved by the United States Congress, a fraction of that amount‚Äîmerely $15 million‚Äîwas authorized. This necessitated a change in strategy by the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), the government agency charged with oversight of the program Instead, program administrators made the \\"brilliant decision... (to) convert Follow Through from a service program to a research and development program\\". Follow Through planners felt that they were responding to an important challenge in the education of disadvantaged students. It was generally hypothesized that the mere provision of specific supports in the form of federal compensatory programs‚Äîsuch as Head Start and Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act‚Äîwould result in increased academic achievement for disadvantaged children, if implemented faithfully by committed teachers. However, studies had shown that despite its successes, in general any gains that children made from Head Start (in measures of academic achievement) \\"faded out\\" during the first few years of elementary school. It was unclear to policy makers and others if the elementary school experience itself caused this phenomenon, or if specific approaches to instruction within schools were the problem. Follow Through intended to solve the problem by identifying what whole-school approaches to curriculum and instruction worked, and what did not. Subsequently, effective models were to be promulgated by the government as exemplars of innovative and proven methods of raising the academic achievement of historically disadvantaged students.  Sociopolitical context  Conceived and implemented in the midst of President Johnson's War on Poverty campaign of the 1960s, Follow Through \\"came out of larger plan which attempted to lay out the causes and cures of poverty in American society on a systemic basis\\". In addition to the landmark Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, other initiatives included economic policies designed to maintain levels of high employment and federally subsidized job training specifically targeted at people from disadvantaged backgrounds. These programs were implemented amidst the turbulent era of the 1960s and 1970s; marked by the struggles and eventual enfranchisement of a number of formerly excluded constituencies \\"including African Americans, feminists, Hispanics, Native Americans, and parents of handicapped children\\".  Planned variation  In typical scientific experiments, treatment and control groups are selected through random assignment. Because Follow Through was an experiment designed to evaluate the efficacy of a number of interventions in local districts, districts chose the interventions they wanted implemented in their schools. This method of selecting a desired intervention among several candidates is called planned variation. One publication refers to it as \\"random innovation\\". Actually, there is nothing random about it. Planned variation was thought to be advantageous over random assignment because it gave local communities (e.g. community members, parents, administrators, and teachers) an element of local control over the implementation of their program. In fact, Hill believed that programs like Follow Through \\"can be... permanent sources of advocacy pressure on behalf of the goals and beneficiaries of federal programs\\".  Goals  Follow Through, like Head Start, was enormous in scope, and designed to remedy the fact that \\"poor children tend to do poorly in school\\". Despite the cut in funding, it nevertheless served a substantial number of students. At its height, the program would grow to encompass 20 different sponsored interventions and approximately 352,000 Follow Through and comparison children in 178 projects nationwide. In addition to identifying the most effective instructional practices and disseminating them to schools and districts, it was also hoped that Follow Through would help reduce the number of potentially conflicting federal intervention programs in schools, which was thought by some to be counterproductive and expensive. Moreover, if models could be identified that were effective with needy children, these interventions could be staged in regular education classrooms as well.  Program administration  Because Follow Through came into existence because of executive and not legislative action, overall control for the program rested in Johnson's Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which spearheaded Johnson's War on Poverty policy. A major component of the policy was community involvement. The Community Action Program (CAP) was charged with fulfilling this function through the establishment of local agencies and programs that carried out various federally sponsored initiatives for disadvantaged populations. However, CAP (and, to some extent, OEO) fell into disrepute among legislators and others, because \\"it resulted in the political mobilization of the poor and the undermining of local government agencies\\". Follow Through was intended to be an extension of the Head Start community action program. Since Head Start was politically popular, a program associated with Head Start would put the OEO \\"back in the good graces of Congress\\". Although Follow Through, like Head Start, was initially intended as a social action program, the decision to transform Follow Through from a social action program to a social experiment was not correspondingly changed in the congressional legislation. Head Start personnel remained involved in the design and implementation of Follow Through, although it appeared they were working at separate ends from the planning group of the OEO, who viewed Follow Through as an empirical investigation. Much of what occurred during the planning stage‚Äîwhich Egbert describes \\"as a time of haste and confusion\\"‚Äîwas an attempt to satisfy constituencies of both perspectives.  Debates about purpose  Due largely to the sociocultural context in which Follow Through was born, planners deliberately structured the program to minimize the involvement of federal officials in the implementation effort. The more Follow Through could be perceived as a locally controlled effort, the better. OEO hoped \\"idealistically\\" that Follow Through could satisfy both empirical and social action purposes. It seems doubtful that any form of experiment could realistically and faithfully serve both aims. According to Hill, true program evaluators should be \\"technical rather than political or programmatic, and their attitudes skeptical and dispassionate\\". The planning group of OEO wanted a true empirical investigation that would determine the most effective models. Conversely, CAP and Head Start personnel advising the Follow Through planners viewed it as a social program. Thus, \\"neither set of constituent groups was fully satisfied with this solution\\".  Sponsors and models  In addition to the planners of Follow Through having conflicting views on the real purpose of the program, the selection of sponsors was equally imprecise. Follow Through sponsors were an eclectic mix of individuals or groups conducting research on instructional methods. Some came from universities, including schools of education. Others were involved in private or grant-based research efforts. The selection method was unclear. According to Watkins, \\"invitations were apparently extended to any group conducting research on instructional methods\\". Some of the sponsors had fairly well developed interventions based on theories of instruction. Others merely had ideas for what might constitute effective interventions. The sponsors also differed widely on the outcomes they expected as a result of their programs. Some sponsors had very specific goals which they believed would lead to very specific outcomes, such as improved literacy skills on measures of reading achievement. Others had more general goals, such as increased self-esteem, or heightened parental involvement in schooling. Most of the programs were in a very early stage of development and had not been extensively (or even moderately) field-tested or piloted. Some programs were so ambiguous that Elmore wrote that \\"most program developers were simply not clear what their programs would actually look like in a fully operational form\\". Many sponsors could not explain precisely which aspects of their models would lead to the stated outcome goals of the model. Despite ambiguities among many of the models (and the minute shades of distinction between some models) the Follow Through literature classified models according to the degree of structure they offered, and where they place emphasis on learning. The \\"degree of structure\\" (e.g. \\"low\\", \\"medium\\", or \\"high\\") offered by a particular model is evidenced by how closely teachers were instructed to adhere to specific procedures, including: ways of arranging the classroom and delivering instruction, the degree of interaction between adults and children, the level of parental involvement, and so forth. Below are brief examples of two models that represent extremes of the spectrum. Direct Instruction model. Developed by Siegfried Engelmann and Wesley Becker of the University of Oregon, direct instruction is scripted and specifies precisely what the teacher says and what the students' responses should be. Moreover, the program designers carefully sequenced the instruction so that students do not progress to higher-order skills unless they have mastered prerequisite basic skills. There is a high degree of interaction between teachers and students so the teacher may receive continuous feedback about how well the students are doing, and adjusts instruction accordingly. The program makes a specific distinction between on-task and off-task behavior: instruction is arranged so that students are fully engaged in learning (via frequent checking for understanding and praises by the teacher) the majority of the time. According to the program sponsors, anything presumed to be learned by students must first be taught by the teacher. Bank Street model. The Bank Street model was developed by Elizabeth Gilkerson and Herbert Zimiles of the Bank Street College of Education in New York. In this model, the students themselves direct learning: they select what tasks they wish to engage in, alone or with peers. The teacher arranges the classroom in ways that the sponsors believe will create the conditions for successful learning: various objects and media are available for children to interact with, and the teacher acts as a facilitator, guiding students through activities. According to the program sponsors, students use previously learned knowledge to construct new knowledge. According to the sponsors, given a safe and stable environment, learning is a process that occurs naturally. In his evaluation of the operational facets of Follow Through, Elmore expressed concern that the shades of distinction among models in terms of structure made comparisons and final analysis among models problematic. Descriptions of the interventions derived from the sponsors themselves. There was no other reliable source from which the program administrators could obtain information about them. Had they been able to see examples of the different models being implemented, they might have been able to ask clarifying questions in order to better distinguish between them‚Äîwhich might have been important for purposes of assessment. Program models were also classified by where they place emphasis on learning, according to three educational orientations: basic skills, cognitive conceptual skills, and affective/cognitive behavior (also see Appendix A). *Basic Skills Models- Concerned primarily with the teaching of basic skills (e.g., the \\"elementary skills of vocabulary, arithmetic computation, spelling, and language\\" *Cognitive Conceptual Skills Models- Emphasized so-called \\"higher-order thinking skills\\" and problem-solving skills *Affective/Cognitive Skills Models- Focused on students' affect (i.e., self- esteem), on the premise that feelings of positive self-worth lead to success in cognitive skills Despite the differences, there were points of agreement among all sponsors. Sponsors agreed that their interventions should be developmentally appropriate‚Äîthat is, models take account of where students are in their development as learners. Second, everyone agreed that teaching and learning should be responsive to the needs of individual learners. Third, they agreed that all students‚Äîeven those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds‚Äîcould learn to the level of their more fortunate peers. Fourth, classroom management procedures that create an appropriate learning environment should be emphasized. Fifth, school should be a place where students experience both high self-esteem and academic success. Ironically, the last point of agreement‚Äîas far as Maccoby and Zellner were concerned‚Äîwas that all interventions should have very clear objectives about the content and skills that students should know and be able to do. This last detail is worth noting for two reasons. First, the program outcome goals that were provided by sponsors appeared relatively broad. For example, the sponsors of the Tucson Early Education Model explain that \\"there is relatively less emphasis on which items are taught and on the transmission of specific content, and more emphasis on 'learning to learn'\\". Likewise, teachers of the Cognitive Curriculum design their own approaches to instruction (including the specification of learning goals), with assistance from sponsors and fellow staff members. While the outcome goals might commonly be described as high levels of academic achievement or mastery of basic and higher-order thinking skills, exactly how students demonstrate these skills is missing in the Follow Through literature. During sponsor meetings, there were several heated arguments between some sponsors about the degree of specificity to which they should link facets of their models to student outcomes or behaviors. Follow Through administrators could not investigate models more thoroughly because of limited time; indeed, only eight months separated the selection of the sponsored model approach and the start of the experiment. Because Congress had already reduced the program budget, there was legitimate concern among planners that a delay in implementation could be disastrous to the program. Another reality was simply the lack of alternate interventions. Because such a large-scale experiment in education had never been done before, the Office of Education had no arsenal of interventions to try out.  Selection of communities  Selection of Follow Through implementation sites proceeded in concert with the selection of models. With the assistance of various state and federal education agencies, 100 communities were invited to apply to the program, based on criteria established by the OEO. According to Egbert, 90 districts applied, of which 30 were chosen for participation in Follow Through. However, due to pressure from influential politicians, additional sites were later added. Not coincidentally, the inclusion of several additional districts appears to have been an attempt to satisfy a number of local political figures by including their communities in the program. While Elmore laments that sites could have been chosen with a greater degree of scientific rigor (e.g. stratified random sampling), this was impossible, for at least two reasons. First, Follow Through administrators had the obligation to select a minimum number of sites with Head Start programs, because the ostensible purpose of Follow Through was to complement Head Start. Second‚Äîaside from political pressures‚Äîcommunities had to be willing participants in the process (ostensibly) to preserving the fidelity of the implementations. On this point, Elmore tends to agree.  Measurement instruments  Because of the range of models, a broad range of instruments and analytical methods was selected in order to measure the targeted outcomes of basic skills, affective behavior, and cognitive behavior. Adams and Engelmann wrote, \\"while critics have complained about test selection and have usually suggested more testing, the assessment effort in this study went well beyond any other educational study conducted before, or since\\". In all, 14 instruments were selected and administered at various times throughout a student's participation in Follow Through. Three groups of students, known as Cohorts (i.e., Cohorts I, II, and III) were followed longitudinally from the time they entered Follow Through (e.g., Kindergarten or Grade 1) until they exited the program (Grade 3). While the authors of the Follow Through report rated the instruments as having high reliability, some sponsors questioned the validity of the instruments in measuring the varied orientations of the models. Other critics, such as House et al. in a Ford Foundation-funded and widely disseminated analysis, also criticized the instruments. However, the evaluators believed that the instrument battery represented the \\"best compromise\\" given the range of models. Despite the relatively large number of students who participated in Follow Through, the evaluators imposed rigorous restrictions on the sample that was actually in the statistical analysis. The comparison group‚Äîstudents from the community identified as not participating in Follow Through‚Äîwas not subject to precisely the same restrictions as the control group, as long as they entered and exited school in the same districts and at the same time as Follow Through students.  Analytical methods  Due to the number of intervention sites and range of instruments the analysis was complex and extensive. According to Watkins, there were over 2,000 comparisons between Follow Through and non-Follow Through groups alone. In 1968, Stanford Research Institute (SRI) was awarded the contract for the Follow Through evaluation. However, due to a variety of factors‚Äîincluding, perhaps, SRIs underestimation of the complexity involved in such a comprehensive analysis‚ÄîAbt Associates, Inc. later inherited the evaluative duties in the summer of 1972. The summary of results, entitled Education as Experimentation: A Planned Variation Model was published in 1977. The empirical goal of the Follow Through evaluation was to determine which models were effective in raising student achievement in the three domains as evidenced by positive effects using the selected instruments. Within models, the evaluators compared performance on the various instruments between Follow Through (FT) and non- Follow Through (NFT) comparison groups at each site. Within groups, the evaluators averaged students' scores on each measure (or outcome variable) in order to yield a \\"group\\" score. Thus, the group scores of FT students were compared to the group scores of NFT students. An important‚Äîand later controversial‚Äîstatistical adjustment technique was employed by the evaluators in order to \\"improve the integrity of the results\\". Because there were differences between treatment and comparison groups (e.g. the average score on an outcome measure for a NFT group might have been higher than the corresponding average score for a FT group), the evaluators employed a statistical method known as analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in order to adjust for these and other differences. The difference between the FT and NFT students was then used to measure the effects of a given model. Sites where models met the criterion for \\"educational effectiveness\\" were assigned a value of 1; negative effects were assigned -1; and null effects‚Äî\\"insignificant educationally, statistically, or both\\"‚Äîwere assigned a zero. According to Elmore, adjusted results using the ANCOVA technique should be interpreted cautiously for two reasons. First, ANCOVA \\"is not a substitute for random assignment, but it has become a conventionally accepted technique for handling initial group differences in quasi-experimental data\\". Second, the larger the initial differences between treatment and control groups, the weaker the strength of the results.  Results  The results of Follow Through did not show how models that showed little or no effects could be improved. But they did show which models‚Äîas suggested by the less than ideal conditions of the experiment‚Äîhad some indications of success. Of these models, Siegfried Engelmann's Direct Instruction method demonstrated the highest gains in the comparative study. The most notable critique of Follow Through (described in detail below) takes issue with the fact that the models which showed positive effects were largely basic skills models. Abt Associates identified five major findings related to the question of differential model effectiveness; the principal empirical findings of the experiment were reported as follows: *\\"The effectiveness of each Follow Through model varied substantially from site group to site group\\" *\\"Models that emphasize basic skills succeed better than other models in helping children gain these skills\\" (p. xxv) *\\"Where models have put their primary emphasis elsewhere than on the basic skills, the children they served have tended to score lower on tests of these skills than they would have done without Follow Through\\" (p. xxvi) *\\"No type of model was notably more successful than the others in raising scores on cognitive conceptual skills\\" (p. xxvi) *\\"Models that emphasize basic skills produced better results on tests of self-concept than did other models\\" (p. xxvi) *To the extent that Follow Through children have 'caught up' with their peers in arithmetic skills, they have tended to do it during the first two years of their involvement in the program\\" (p. xxvii) *\\"Follow Through has been relatively effective with the most disadvantaged children it has served\\" (p. xxviii) A separate analysis examined the impact of Siegfried Engelmann's Direct Instruction method on students over several decades. This analysis suggested a long term benefit.  Critiques  Wisler et al, in their review of the Follow Through experience, wrote that it was likely that no other educational data has been examined more extensively, excepting the Equality of Educational Opportunity Survey. At least three major reevaluations of the Follow Through data exist in the literature: House, et al. (1978); Bereiter and Kurland (1981); and Kennedy (1981). All largely confirm the original statistical analysis conducted by Abt Associates. Generally, the consensus among most researchers is that structured models tended to perform better than unstructured ones, and that the Direct Instruction and Behavior Analysis models performed better on the instruments employed than did the other models.) Most critiques of the Follow Through experiment have tended to focus on the operational and design problems that plagued the experiment. In particular, these critiques note that there was more variation within a particular model than there was from model to model. This problem has largely been attributed to the problem of how to measure the effectiveness of a particular implementation; the measures used were largely qualitative and anecdotal. In some instances, sites were included in the analysis that had ceased to implement specific models, or the model sponsors had serious reservations about the way particular models were implemented. The most vocal critique was the House, et al. (1978) reanalysis. The article‚Äîalong with several rebuttals from the original evaluation team and other researchers‚Äîwas published by the Harvard Educational Review in 1978. The authors were extremely dissatisfied with the pronouncement of the evaluators that the basic skills models outperformed the other models. The authors approach the critique on the assumption that basic skills are decidedly just that‚Äîbasic. The authors imply that basic skills are only taught through \\"rote methods\\"‚Äîa decidedly negative connotation (p. 137). Regarding the finding that \\"models that emphasize basic skills produced better results on tests of self-concept than did other models\\", the authors question the efficacy of the self-esteem measures; implying, among other things, that young students cannot possibly have a concrete understanding of self-concept (pp. 138‚Äì139). While the article intended to review the operational design of the Follow Through evaluation, instead it appears to (1) refute the finding that cognitive-conceptual and affective-cognitive models were largely failures, and (2) unilaterally condemn the models that emphasize basic skills. The implication is that the goal of education should not be increased student achievement in solely basic skills, and that Follow Through would have been better employed to discover how measures of all three orientations could be made successful. Absent from the critique is the finding that, for third graders, only the Direct Instruction model demonstrated positive effects in all three domains, and that one of the remaining two models (Behavior Analysis; the other was the Parent Education model) that had positive effects in at least two domains was also a self- described \\"basic skills model\\".  Dissemination  In 1972, the OE created the Joint Dissemination Review Panel (JDRP) and the National Diffusion Network (NDN) to disseminate information about effective models to schools and districts nationwide. JDRP reviewed programs for effectiveness according to a mixture of empirical and holistic criteria. NDN was responsible for disseminating the results based on the recommendations of JDRP. Watkins (1997) criticizes the dissemination criteria for two reasons. First, the organizations identified programs for dissemination that had not been part of the Follow Through experiment and for which there was no empirical validation. Second, JDRP and NDN endorsed programs that showed improvement in areas \\"such as self-concept, attitude, and mental or physical health (of students) ... (or) if it has a positive impact on individuals other than students, for example if it results in improved instructional behavior of teachers\\" (p. 47), but did not raise students' academic achievement. Thus, programs \\"that had been incapable of demonstrating improved academic performance in the Follow Through evaluation\\" were recommended for adoption by schools and districts. Watkins cites the former Commissioner of Education, Ernest Boyer, who wrote with dismay that \\"Since only one of the sponsors (Direct Instruction) was found to produce positive results more consistently than any of the others, it would be inappropriate and irresponsible to disseminate information on all of the models\\". Of course, it would have been ideal to have the kind of conclusiveness associated with laboratory experiments when we conduct social experiments in communities and schools. Andy B. Anderson (1975) wrote that \\"the idea of a controlled experiment has long been recognized as a goal worth pursuing in the social and behavioral sciences for the same obvious reason that made this mode of inquiry the predominant research strategy of the natural and physical sciences: the controlled experiment permits the most unequivocal assessment of a variable's influence on another variable\\". Particularly when experimentation is used as a tool for informing policy decisions (e.g., in recommending the efficacy of some instructional approaches with disadvantaged students over other, less effective interventions), the design should be of the highest degree of rigor possible. For a variety of reasons, Follow Through did not have the classic characteristics of a true experiment.  Criticism  Lack of systematic selection of interventions and lack of specificity of treatment effects. Due to a variety of circumstances detailed earlier, the Follow Through programs were not systematically developed or selected according to any type of uniform criteria. Given more time, sponsors may have been able to better identify the types of treatment effects that an observer might expect to occur under controlled conditions. More importantly, program sponsors might also have been required to show those specific facets of their interventions (e.g., particular pedagogical techniques) which would produce the intended effects. Despite these flaws, the sponsors agreed on being subject to the same evaluation instruments. Unfortunately, the instruments shed little light on what about the ineffective programs made them so unsuccessful. The converse is also true. Since structured programs tended to show better effects than the unstructured ones, it would appear logical that efforts might have been made to identify commonalities among the effective structured programs. These shared characteristics might have informed the development of additional effective programs or made the ineffective approaches better. Starting in 1982, funding was in fact reduced for those programs that were identified as successful in Follow Through, perhaps on the presumption that funding would be better diverted to assisting failed programs. Ultimately, programs that had lesser empirical validation were nonetheless recommended for dissemination along with the successful models. Lack of random assignment. Random assignment of subjects into treatment and control groups is the ideal method of attributing change in a sample to an intervention and not to some other effect (including the pre-existing capabilities of students, teachers, or school systems). However, for a variety of practical reasons, this procedure was not done in Follow Through. Instead, sites were selected \\"opportunistically\\", based on their readiness to participate in the evaluation, and on their unique circumstances of need. As Stebbins et al. point out, the treatment groups were often the neediest children. To randomly select some of the most disadvantaged children (many of whom participated in Head Start prior to Follow Through) out of the evaluation would certainly have been negatively perceived by community members. Stebbins et al. point out that there were \\"considerable variations in the range of children served\\"; yet despite the presence of \\"many of the problems inherent in field social research...evaluations of these planned variations provides us with an opportunity to examine the educational strategies under real life conditions as opposed to contrived and tightly controlled laboratory conditions\\". Narrowness of instruments. Adams and Engelmann note that many critics have suggested that more instruments should have been used in the Follow Through evaluation. Egbert agrees with Adams and Engelmann that the data collection efforts were extensive. Despite the agreement among model sponsors on a uniform set of instruments to evaluate the effectiveness of their models‚Äîthat model sponsors believed their programs achieved gains on more intrinsic, less measurable indicators of performance, such as increased self-worth or greater parental involvement. To the extent that these desired outcomes occurred, and benefited the lives of students in ways that might never be measurably through quantitative means, those aspects of many models were successful. Both the House et al. critique and others (cited in Wisler) express concerns about the inadequacy of the instruments used to measure self-esteem the Follow Through evaluation (i.e., the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Scale (IARS) and the Coopersmith Self- Esteem Inventory). But it was better, according to many researchers, to measure outcomes imperfectly rather than not to measure them at all. Thus, while \\"perfect\\" measures of desired outcomes might never exist, one should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good‚Äîin other words, one could call into question the efficacy of conducting any experiment at all on the basis that some bias or imperfection exists. Was Follow Through a social or scientific program? After an initial period, new regulations mandated that 80 percent of Follow Through funding was to be allocated to the provision of service while 20 percent was to be used for knowledge production. The regulations themselves suggest that Follow Through was principally \\"a federally funded education program which contained a built-in research component\\". An inevitable conflict exists when one attempts to operationalize a federal program in education that possesses both service delivery and research and development objectives. Rivlin et al. point out that \\"the byzantine complexity of the public policymaking process makes the conduct of social experiments extremely difficult\\". Given the reduction in funding, the decision to engage in an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions in an empirical experiment appears appropriate and straightforward. However, if the change is not reflected in Congressional legislation or communicated clearly at the local level, issues of implementation and conflict with deeply held values inevitably result. There is much evidence that indicates confusion about the intent of the Follow Through evaluation at the administrative level. Issues of local control. The planned variation aspect of Follow Through was thought to be beneficial‚Äîperhaps superior‚Äîto other forms of experimentation (e.g., selection of sites based on randomized assignment) because it would give local communities and schools an element of ownership integral to the successful implementation of the models. Despite the planned variation design, local communities in many sites were nevertheless deeply critical of the program. In some ways, criticism of Follow Through had preceded directly from Head Start. Ostensibly, the social service purpose and goals of the Head Start program were clearer than those of the Follow Through evaluation. Nevertheless, community leaders had felt that Head Start did not give enough decision-making responsibility to parents and community members. Local interests wanted to make curricular decisions, including the changing of facets of some program models Evans cautioned that \\"educational communities and contexts vary\\", which can have a direct effect on the implementation of a model. More problematic, however, is Elmore's and Hill's assertions that the Follow Through models interfered with local teaching methods and practices. As Elmore writes, \\"for Follow Through, the problem was how to implement program variations in a system where most day-to-day decisions about program content are made at the school or classroom level\\". Rhine et al. suggest that it is difficult to get teachers to modify their behavior. And if the objective of changing behavior is achieved, teachers feel little ownership on the model‚Äîa decidedly dubious investment. What inevitably seems to happen is that teachers reject programs outright, while others \\"surrender to the program\\". The \\"fact-value dichotomy\\". Ernest R. House, co-author of the 1978 critique of the Follow Through evaluation, penned an article about what he calls the \\"fact-value dichotomy\\" in social experimentation and educational research: \\"the belief that facts refer to one thing and values refer to something totally different\\". House elucidates the writings of Donald Campbell, a researcher in the field of evaluation. House noted that, according to Campbell, facts cannot exist outside the framework of one's values because inevitably, an investigation that uncovers a certain fact is either consistent with the researcher's internal values or against them. What results is a difficult choice: the researcher must either reject the fact, or modify his or her value to accommodate the fact. Campbell also believed, according to House, that values‚Äîas opposed to facts‚Äîcould be chosen rationally. House agrees with Campbell's assertion in part, but departs from Campbell in that he believes that facts and values cannot exist in isolation; rather, they \\"blend together in the conclusions of evaluation studies, and, indeed, blend together throughout evaluation studies\\". House suggests that the reader envision facts and values as existing on a continuum from \\"bute facts to bare values\\". Accordingly, rarely do \\"fact claims\\" or \\"value claims\\" fall entirely at one end of the spectrum or the other. House provides examples: \\"Diamonds are harder than steel\\" might fall at the left of the spectrum, while \\"Cabernet is better than Chardonnay\\" falls to the right. In conclusion, House proposes an entirely a new method of empirical investigation called \\"deliberative democratic evaluation\\". In it, evaluators arrive at \\"unbiased claims\\" through \\"inclusion of all relevant stakeholder perspectives, values, and interests in the study; extensive dialogue between the evaluator and stakeholders...and extensive deliberation to reach valid conclusions in the study\\". House decries the use of entirely rational methods when applied to evaluations; indeed, he recommends a degree of subjectiveness, because evaluations like Follow Through cannot exist outside deeply held values. Hill writes: \\"There is seldom anyone at the local level whose commitment to an externally-imposed curricular innovation, planning process, or financial management scheme springs spontaneously from deeply held personal values.\\" House argues that all decision-making that stems from evaluations in education is the result of a compromise. Watkins argues that Follow Through resulted in a clash over values based on different beliefs about how children learn, which can be boiled down to \\"natural growth\\" or \\"unfolding\\" theories versus. theories of \\"changing behavior\\". Watkins asserts that most education experts today do not judge programs by their relative effectiveness with different student populations, but rather by their \\"congruence with prevailing philosophies of education\\".

It is his first to feature members of his touring band, which many Hackett fans consider as the \\"classic line-up\\". The musicians are his brother John Hackett, Nick Magnus, Dik Cadbury, John Shearer, and Pete Hicks. In 2005, Spectral Mornings was remastered and re-released on Virgin Records. The new edition features updated liner notes and bonus tracks. A new 5.1 surround mix of the album by Steven Wilson is included in Hackett's 2015 compilation box set Premonitions: The Charisma Recordings 1975‚Äì1983. In 2015, Hackett appeared on a re-recorded version, \\"Spectral Mornings 2015\\", with new lyrics written by David Longdon of Big Big Train, and sung by Longdon and Christina Booth of Magenta. Proceeds from the track on release went to Parkinson's Society UK. Background After the release of his previous album, Please Don't Touch!, in 1978, Hackett wished to tour the material from the album along with material from his previous solo album, Voyage of the Acolyte.Hackett, Steve, Spectral Mornings 2005 Remaster liner notes, 2005. EMI This meant that he needed to assemble a touring band since the personnel on Please Don't Touch! had essentially consisted of guest musicians. The band that he created for this purpose became the band that he used in the studio for Spectral Mornings and the following album, 1980's Defector. Recording \\"Clocks - The Angel of Mons\\" and the title track were both written and performed live on the Please Don't Touch tour prior to the album's recording. Elements of the intro performed going into \\"Please Don't Touch\\" later became parts of \\"Tigermoth\\". The album was recorded at Phonogram Studios in Hilversum in the Netherlands between January and February 1979. Hackett later remarked \\"It was 15 degrees below zero and all the lakes and canals were frozen... The weather was so bad that all we could do was apply ourselves to work. The studio was at Phonogram Records' headquarters and it felt as though it was in its own world. We played night and day and combined this activity with partying like crazy. The sessions were intense and the album was recorded with very little sleep. We all got a tremendous buzz from recording it as we felt that it would be well received. I was confident when I finally played the final masters to Tony Stratton-Smith at Charisma as I thought we'd done a great job.\\"Hackett, Steve, Premonitions: The Charisma Recordings 1975 ‚Äì 1983 liner notes, 2015. Virgin Records This is the second album for which Hackett used a Roland GR-500 Guitar Synthesizer. It can be heard on two tracks: \\"The Virgin and the Gypsy\\" and \\"Tigermoth\\". Lead vocals on most of the album were provided by Pete Hicks, which were very often backed with harmonies by Steve Hackett and Dik Cadbury. Cadbury arranged the harmony vocals, having been trained as a counter tenor (falsetto) singer. Hackett himself sings lead on \\"The Ballad of the Decomposing Man\\". Songs=Side one The album starts with \\"Every Day\\" which is an anti-drug song about Steve's own experiences of the drug culture when his first girlfriend fell victim to \\"Cleopatra's Needle\\", and it would become his signature song from his solo career with a guitar solo at the track's coda. \\"The Virgin and the Gypsy\\" was inspired by the novella of the same name. It has an acoustic folk sound with vocal harmonies, twelve tracks of 12-string guitars mixed together, a guitar synthesizer solo, harpsichord and double-tracking flutes solos. Parts of the song were previously recorded in sessions for Please Don't Touch in an instrumental called \\"Seven of Cups\\". \\"The Red Flower of Tachai Blooms Everywhere\\" was inspired by east-Asian culture. Hackett plays a Cantonese koto on the track, accompanied by a Mellotron imitating a Japanese singer, flute and gong percussion. \\"Clocks - The Angel of Mons\\" was considered for a horror movie soundtrack. Drummer John Shearer plays a long drum solo at the climax of the track, the power of which Hackett compared to sounding like \\"being trampled by elephants\\". John Hackett plays a Moog Taurus bass pedal synthesizer on this track using his hands as opposed to his feet. \\"The Ballad of the Decomposing Man\\" is sung by Hackett in a tongue-in-cheek George Formby- style, in which Hackett displays a sense of humour like songs on the previous Genesis albums with Peter Gabriel such as \\"Harold the Barrel\\". Hackett also plays the harmonica for the first time on his albums in this track. The second half of the song, \\"The Office Party\\" was played in a calypso style with a lot of percussion, violin from bassist Dik Cadbury and comical speaking. Side two Side two, opens with \\"Lost Time in Cordoba\\" which is a classical guitar and flute duet, in a style similar to Hackett's future classical guitar albums such as Bay of Kings. \\"Tigermoth\\" is a ghost story told from the perspectives of several pilots from the First World War, shot down whilst flying planes of the same name. The first half of the track has a dramatic feel with jarring Mellotron chords, bass pedals and guitar synthesizer. The acoustic second half contains Hicks's vocals and a lullaby ending. The album finishes with the title track, which began life as a vocal piece. However, after Hackett played the vocal melody to his band on the guitar, Pete Hicks decided that the track sounded \\"great as it is\\", telling Hackett to \\"keep the piece as an instrumental\\", leading Hackett to joke later on that Hicks talked himself out of a job on the track. It has become his signature instrumental from his solo career. Many progressive rock guitarists, such as Steve Rothery (from Marillion), consider this track to be an inspiration.
