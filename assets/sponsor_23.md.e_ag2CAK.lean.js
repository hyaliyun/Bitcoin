Those subjects are not only related to each other but also to other important aspects that are very necessary for keeping PHE in a close-knit relationship.  Why PHE?  More than 1 billion people live in ecological hotspots, many of which are remote areas of critically important biodiversity under intense pressure from human activity. Conservation work is usually located in these remote areas to protect the remaining biodiversity. In the developing world , the communities in these remote areas often suffer from ill health because of limited access to health services or family planning. These communities also tend to suffer from poor nutrition, water supplies or sanitation. Inadequate health care in these communities is usually because of economic struggles. Livelihoods in the rural communities depend on natural resources and small-scale agriculture, which can force people to use natural resources unsustainably because of pressures such as rapid population growth or health issues. This can be damaging to ecosystems and the biodiversity in these rural areas. Conversely, people‚Äôs health relies on the health of their environment. Their surrounding ecosystem provides them with goods and services such as water, food, medicine, fuel wood, building materials, and other resources. Damage or disruption of these natural goods and services can have severe consequences for human health. Projects that take the PHE approach work to create healthier communities and ecosystems. These projects aim to bring better health services to remote communities to improve participation in conservation efforts. PHE projects also promote family planning services to help slow population growth that can put pressure on natural resources. That means PHE approaches strive to simultaneously improve access to health services while helping communities manage their natural resources in ways that improve their health and livelihood even as they protect the environment. Beyond this, the PHE approach also targets synergies between human health and ecosystem health by including a wide spectrum of development and conservation targets such as the sustainable management of natural resources, improving livelihoods, food security and nutrition, and by maintaining or restoring habitats and ecosystem functions. By focusing on the synergy between communities and their environment, the PHE approach conserves biodiversity while at the same time improving environmental health conditions for the local people. PHE is effective at achieving a wide range of positive results over multiple sectors.  History of PHE  In the late 1980s conservation organizations and practitioners began to realize the benefits of improving the quality of life for people by managing biodiversity and natural resources. These projects were initially called integrated conservation and development projects (ICDP) and addressed a wide variety of community development needs. At the end of the 1990s it was realized that ICDPs were not achieving conservation or development goals as successfully as anticipated. This was because the scope of ICDPs was often too broad. One of the lessons learned from ICDP attempts was that the success of the projects depended on the ability to focus on key interventions and avoid excessive complexity. From the lessons learned from early ICDPs the conservation sector gave birth to the PHE approach with a new generation of integrated projects. Program designers began to realize that efforts to conserve biological diversity (biodiversity) in developing countries was most successful in long-term indicators when local people perceived their efforts as serving their economic and cultural interests. This gave birth to the integrated development approach. To achieve success it was found that ICDPs had to consider the linkage between conservation and development objectives in every unique place that the project was implemented. The first step to determining the linkages is to consider where the conservation and economic development goals intersect. Development interventions should then be introduced where this intersection occurs. One of the most important lessons learned from ICDPs in the last 20 years was the failure to equitably involve projected beneficiaries as partners in all phases of project implementation, from design through evaluation, has led to consistently disappointing project results. It must be recognized that local participants are not a homogenous group of community members but differ widely in terms of access and dependency of resources, economic positions and their sensitivity to environmental changes. These lessons learned from past ICDPs has led the design of the stakeholder analysis where individuals or groups vested in the project are identified and incorporated into all stages of project design and implementation. Drawing on what was learned from ICDPs, the conservation sector piloted the PHE approach during the 1990s with the first generation of PHE integrated projects. Since then USAID (the United States Agency for International Development), the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Johnson & Johnson, and the Summit Foundation have worked to strengthen the approach. The PHE approach has pushed on with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG) in mind. As the PHE approach advances it has demonstrated to have the kind of synergies needed to reach these goals. Past PHE Project Profiles Successful Communities from Ridge to Reef, Kenya: This project was implemented in an area designated a UNESCO reserve in the Kiunga National Marine Reserve. The reserve has outstanding marine biodiversity of over 11,000 species, 60-70% of which are endemic to the Indo-Pacific Ocean. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) with funding from USAID, was able to provide communities that depend on the reserve‚Äôs resources access to family planning through a mobile clinic. Members of the community began to actively participate in conservation activities once they know WWF was willing to help them meet basic health needs. Healthy Families, Health Forests, Cambodia: When refugees from the Cambodia/Vietnam war in the 1970s returned to their homes they found their land had been destroyed through logging and agriculture. With USAID support, Conservation International helped the Khmer Daeum refugees to replenish their land and supplied the refugees with their first-ever access to family planning. Healthy families were able to develop long-term plans for sustainable land use and local women created associations that mobilized the community to increase income earning opportunities and strengthen participation in conservation activities. Integrated Population and Coastal Resource Management (IPOPCORM), Philippines Rapid population growth in the Philippines has led to deforestation and destruction of coral reefs. Only 3% of original forest cover remains and only 5% of coral reefs are intact and in pristine condition. This uncontrollable population growth, coupled with the depletion of coastal resources led to the development of the Integrated Population and Coastal Resource Management (IPOPCORM) project with support from USAID and PATH Foundation Philippines Inc. The IPOPCORM Project focuses on communities in the Philippines‚Äô most endangered coastal reef areas and works to improve food security and livelihoods by promoting family planning and sustainable fisheries management. The program has earned strong support from local mayors and community members who have appreciated IPOPCORM‚Äôs focus on improving livelihoods. Population and Resource Management in Madagascar Africa‚Äôs greatest concentration of unique plant and animal species can be found in Madagascar. These species have been historically threatened by rapid population growth leading to deforestation. USAID/Madagascar planned for the development of an innovative population and environment program in the region that linked community-based natural resource management with interventions to improve family health and planning while allowing for better preservation of the island‚Äôs unique biodiversity. The program had worked with local communities in order to support family planning services, sustainable agriculture, good governance, improved food production, alternative livelihoods, and environmental education. Community-Centered Conservation Efforts in Tanzania The Jane Goodall Institute, with funding from USAID/Tanzania, constructed the TACARE project to eliminate poverty and support sustainable livelihoods, while alleviating the depletion of natural resources in the country. The community-based approach aimed to improve the livelihoods in Tanzanian communities while promoting conservation and an understanding of the need to preserve biodiversity. This approach provides family planning methods, information, and counseling by community volunteers that has resulted in a greater acceptance of family planning. With funding from USAID/Washington the TACARE approach is being replicated in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Andean Highlands of Ecuador A collaborative operations research effort by CEMOPLAF, World Neighbors, and the University of Michigan‚Äôs Population-Environment Fellows Program was supported by USAID. The study showed quantified benefits of integrating family planning efforts and information with agriculture and natural resource management in the area. \\"Conservation Through Public Health\\" With funding from USAID, Conservation Through Public Health, a Ugandan-based NGO and US registered non-profit added family planning to its integrated One Health program promoting wildlife health and community-based health care to prevent zoonotic disease transmission between people, wildlife and livestock. CTPH has received recognition for having a model PHE program promoting gorilla conservation and community health and development in and around Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, SW Uganda.

He acquired an appreciation for the \\"no-nonsense functional aesthetic of the sea and the factories\\", which he has described as \\"an important influence in my approach to design.\\" He graduated from the Pratt Institute with a degree in industrial design in 1960. The subject of graphic design was just being introduced in American universities at the time; when Wyman met a student who studied logo design with Paul Rand at Yale, he wanted to design logos. Wyman began his career at General Motors in Detroit, Michigan, where he worked on a packaging system for Delco automotive parts that unified 1,200 different packages. Later, he moved to the office of William Schmidt, where he produced the graphics for the U.S. pavilion at a 1962 trade fair in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. In 1963, Wyman moved to New York, where he joined the George Nelson firm. He designed the graphics for the Chrysler Pavilion at the New York World's Fair. He later reported that devising a \\"pointing hand\\" themed logo and adapting it to the site directional signs convinced him that logos could play a more important role in an overall design program. In December 1966, he traveled to Mexico City to work at Pedro Ramirez Vazquez's office, and worked with many other designers in the identity program of the 1968 Summer Olympic Games. Wyman stopped working for the organizing committee in October 1968, he then designed the graphics programs for the Mexico City Metro. After returning to New York, Wyman formed a partnership with Bill Cannan (Wyman & Cannan). In 1979, he established his own firm, Lance Wyman Ltd. He has also taught corporate and wayfinding design at Parsons School of Design since 1973. Work Exhibit featuring Wyman's work in Rio de Janeiro (2016) Wyman, who has been described as a \\"rock star\\" of graphic arts, made his reputation when he collaborated with Eduardo Terrazas, under the direction of architect Pedro Ram√≠rez V√°zquez, in the development of the entire design campaign for the Mexico 1968 Summer Olympic Games. He has also designed icons for museums and many other institutions, individualized signs for buildings at the National Zoo in Washington D.C., and many other symbols. Stepping outside his usual genre, he designed a poster for the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign. Perhaps his most enduring design is the stylized route map he devised for the Washington Metro in the mid-1970s, prioritizing the clear representation of routes, stations, transfer points, and certain landmarks over showing distances to scale. In 2011, Wyman was called on to design a new Metro map depicting new lines and route orientations, as well as some station names that had been expanded to the point of being cumbersome.Steve Delahoyde, Lance Wyman Difficult Task of Re-Designing His Original DC Metro Map, Mediabistro.com, Unbeige, June 6, 2011.Dana Hedgpeth, \\"Metro's Main Designer\\", Express (Washington, D.C.), June 6, 2011, p. 12.

They were one of few Japanese metal bands who had international exposure in the United States during the eighties. Originally disbanded in 1990, Dead End reunited in 2009 after almost two decades. Although they achieved only limited commercial success in their homeland, Dead End had a significant impact on its rock scene, influencing numerous musicians in, or related to, the developing visual kei scene in the 1990s. Specifically, Morrie who inspired the visual appearance and rough vocal style of many prominent singers. History =1984‚Äì1990: Formation to disbandment= Dead End was formed in December 1984 by singer Morrie and guitarist Takahiro, both previously in the band Liar, bassist Crazy Cool Joe coming from the band Rajas, and drummer Tano from Terra Rosa. They had their first show in March 1985, at the Osaka Bourbon House in front of almost 500 people. In 1986, they went on a nationwide tour called Dademonium Break Tour '86 Vol.1, after which guitarist Takahiro left and was replaced by You from Terra Rosa. In June they released their first records, the singles \\"Replica\\" and \\"Worst Song\\" on the independent label Night Gallery. Followed by their debut album Dead Line on June 30, which sold 20,000 copies, a rare achievement for a \\"house\\" band not yet signed to a major label. To commemorate the release of the album, the band played the Osaka Bourbon House again, and this time had a crowd of 800 people. In 1987, drummer Tano left the band due to poor health, just before Dead End signed to major label Victor Entertainment. He was replaced by Masafumi Minato from Saber Tiger after an audition held in May, completing the \\"classic\\" line- up that remained until their disbandment. On September 8 the band released their most successful album Ghost of Romance, which reached No.14 on the Oricon chart. At the end of the year Dead End signed with the American label Metal Blade Records for releases of Ghost of Romance and their next album. Ghost of Romance was released in December, and although it didn't enter the charts, it received a very good review in Kerrang! magazine. On May 21, 1988 Dead End released their third album Shambara, followed by their first major single \\"Blue Vices\\" in December. That same month Psychoscape, a live video recording from their concert on September 24 at Shibuya Public Hall, was released. Shambara was released in the United States on September 1, and like the previous album it did not chart but received good reviews. Though music videos of \\"Danse Macabre\\" and \\"Blue Vices\\" were airing on MTV's Headbangers Ball television program, and their songs had decent airplay on rock radio stations, Morrie notes that \\"it just happened\\" and he \\"was not conscious of the US at that time.\\" The year 1989 started off with the band signing to major label BMG Japan, and they soon went to London, England to write songs and record video material until May. At this time their style changed, with the music being softer than their previous releases. On July 9 they held a concert in Shinjuku called Standing Convention Gig, where many new songs were played, that same month their second major single \\"So Sweet So Lonely\\" was released . On September 21 they released their fourth album Zero, in October they went on a live club tour and in mid-November a concert hall tour. It was this year when they started getting major exposure and promotion on TV. At the year's end they released their second live video Hyperd., which was recorded at their concert at Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall. However, after a concert at the Nakano Sun Plaza on January 21, 1990, Minato left Dead End and the members decided to disband. On April 21 the single \\"Good Morning Satellite\\" was released, and on July 21 a self-titled live album recorded at their last concert was released. =2009‚Äìpresent: Reunion and You's death= On July 3, 2009, after almost 20 years, Dead End announced they would reunite on August 15 at Jack in the Box 2009 Summer at Makuhari Messe. On October 1, a new album titled Metamorphosis was announced for release on November 11 by Danger Crue Records. Also released was a remastered release of Dead Line (also available in a limited edition including a DVD from a concert in January 1987 at Osaka Manichi Hall), SHM-CD releases of Ghost of Romance and Shambara, and reissues of Zero and Dead End on Blu-spec CDs in December, all with bonus tracks. They went on to perform sold-out concerts on November 17 at Osaka Big Cat and November 20 at Shibuya-AX, which Minato chose not to participate in. He later ceased to take part in the reunion altogether, with Shinya Yamada (Luna Sea) being support drummer before Kei Yamazaki (Venomstrip) took over the role. On March 20, 2010, Dead End performed on the second day of the Rock May Kan venue's 30 anniversary concert Legend of Rock May Kan at JCB Hall, along with D'erlanger and 44 Magnum. Two days later, they performed at the concert Third Devour at Namba Hatch in Osaka, the third in a concert series called Four Wizards Night-Crawling, joined by Gastunk, Pay Money to My Pain and Cocobat. In August, they performed at Rock in Japan Festival 2010 in Hitachi Seaside Park and Jack in the Box Summer 2010. In 2011, from January 22 to February 8 Dead End supported Acid Black Cherry on a Zepp tour. On August 8 they hosted a charity concert titled Fourth Devour at Shibuya O-East, where themselves, Pay Money to My Pain and Lynch. performed. All proceeds were donated to the victims of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. In October they held a three-date tour called Death Ace 2011, with the final concert at Shibuya O-West on October 13 being broadcast live worldwide via Ustream. On October 23, they performed at the V-Rock Festival '11 held at Saitama Super Arena. On November 9, Dead End released their first single in over twenty years, \\"Conception\\", the first in a three-month series of consecutive releases. The second \\"Final Feast\\" was released on December 14, with the third \\"Yume Oni Uta\\" out on January 11, 2012.

The following year, they performed at the first night of Luna Sea's Lunatic Fest on June 28, 2015 and went on their own Witch Hunt Tour 2015. Inactive for a few years, Morrie said that Dead End activities depended on You, and the guitarist admitted in 2019 that this was the case. In March 2019, You said that he wanted to make an acoustic solo album before working on Dead End. When this album was released in March 2020, You stated that Dead End would restart, and that he would be spending the next three months writing songs for the band. However, Dead End announced on June 19, 2020 that You had died from sepsis on June 16, aged 56. Music style Dead End, both in local and in Western media, was seen as a non-typical metal band whose music is hard to categorize. Allmusic author Eduardo Rivadavia, wrote that they're a \\"prototypical Japanese melodic heavy metal band\\", while in the '80s Kerrang! magazine review on Shambara, their music was described as similar to those of the English bands The Mission and The Cult, whose music takes cues from hard rock, gothic rock, and post-punk. In the same review, Morrie's vocal style was described as an intermediate between Graham Bonnet and Wayne Hussey. Also in the year before their disbandment Dead End's style changed, with the music being softer and poppier in sound than their previous releases. Although opposite of the media, Morrie doesn't think of Dead End as a metal band. On the question \\"If there was one single song that best showcases the soul of Dead End\\" You said he is fond of some songs, but does not think there is a song that showcases Dead End, while for Morrie it is \\"Song of a Lunatic\\", that \\"is a look into the abyss, the back of my head.\\" The majority of the band's catalog of music is written by You, followed by Morrie, and then Takahiro, who wrote seven of eight songs on the first album. Morrie is responsible for all the lyrics, which are mostly in Japanese with some English lines, and contributed three songs on the second, and four (two with the band's producer Hajime Okano) on the fourth album. Joe composed one song in each of the first three albums, and they all showcase the bass. The band usually does not discuss their ideas on sound and style, yet Morrie says, \\"we individually do what we want to do based on the songs that You creates, even if it destroys the original concept of the song.\\" In regard to band's music and lyrics, Morrie described them as explosive and outward with an incentive kind of a death drive. =Influence= Morrie's way of singing in the early years of Dead End was influenced by Ronnie James Dio, from whom he \\"learned how to crush the treble pitches\\", and by Baki of Gastunk, \\"who influenced him to establish his own style\\", leading to a combination of clean and distorted vocals. However, he claims his present way of singing and vocal approach are quite different now. Dead End had a significant impact on the Japanese rock scene, influencing numerous musicians in, or related to, the developing visual kei scene in the 1990s, including; Sugizo and Shinya from Luna Sea, Tetsuya and Sakura from L'Arc-en-Ciel, the latter being a roadie for them in the late 1980s, Hiro from La'cryma Christi, Yuana from Kagerou, and Hitoki from Kuroyume. Morrie also inspired the visual appearances and rough vocal styles of Ryuichi from Luna Sea, Hyde from L'Arc-en-Ciel, Yasu from Janne da Arc and Acid Black Cherry, Kiyoharu from Kuroyume, and Aki from Laputa.„ÄéLaputa‚Äïfrom the cradle to the grave 1999 (Fool's Mate extrax)„Äè„ÄÅ FOOL‚ÄôS MATE„ÄÅ1999„ÄÅ Dead End went on to inspire modern bands such as Esprit D'Air, who released a cover of \\"Serafine\\" as a single in 2018.

History =Early years of KGBS and KSOX= In 1941, McHenry Tichenor, former publisher of the Valley Morning Star newspaper, broke ground on a new radio station at a site known as Harbenito, between Harlingen and San Benito. The \\"Harbenito station\\", KGBS on 1240 kHz, took to the air at dawn on August 20, 1941. It was the third radio station in the Valley. The station obtained a CBS radio affiliation in 1943, just two years after signing on. Meanwhile, after several years of protests from the 1530 AM station in Cincinnati, the FCC approved the application of Roy Hofheinz to build a new station in Harlingen. The city would become the smallest in the country to host a 50,000-watt radio station, which finally went on air on December 1, 1951. KSOX was a Mutual Broadcasting System affiliate. Three thousand residents attended the station's open house to see a modern studio facility, a scaled-down version of his KTHT in Houston. =KGBS moves to 1530 and becomes KGBT= Two years later, effective September 1, 1953, KGBS bought the KSOX facilities and moved its entire intellectual unit there, including its CBS Radio affiliation. (The 1240 license was surrendered; the frequency was revived in 1957 using the KSOX call letters.) The Harbenito facilities were converted to television station KGBS-TV, which launched on October 4. On New Year's Day 1954, KGBS became KGBT, matching the TV station, which changed its call letters on December 9, 1953. The Tichenor group in the Valley was completed with KELT FM 96.9. Into the 1960s, KGBT became a highly successful station in the market, particularly once it flipped to Spanish-language programming. In 1967, it commanded more than a 60 percent share of local radio listening just on the United States side of the border. In 1991, it still rated third in the market despite being on AM. =Univision ownership= The Tichenor family's media holdings, later renamed the Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation, were acquired by Univision in 2003 in a $3 billion merger, ending 62 years of Tichenor ownership of KGBS/KGBT. KGBT was affiliated with the Univision America network from 2012 until its demise in mid-2015, when KGBT and several other former Univision America stations changed to a Spanish Christian format known as \\"Amor Celestial\\". On December 20, 2016, Univision announced that KGBT would be one of the charter affiliates of their new Spanish-language sports network, Univision Deportes Radio; the launch occurred in March 2017. The network became known as TUDN Radio in 2019.

Architects and Engineers prepare 'design drawings' that develop required strengths by applying rebar size, spacing, location, and lap of steel. By contrast, 'shop/placing drawings' or 'fabrication drawings' apply the intent of the 'design drawings' for the ironworker. These designs specify the quantity, description, placement, bending shapes with dimensions and laps of the reinforcing steel. Various applications are used to produce bar bending schedules which can be directly fed into CNC machines that cuts and bends the rebar to the desired shapes. The fabrication of the bars is scheduled and the placing/fixing sequence indicated, adding the elements required to support those bars during construction. 'Shop/placing drawings' are submitted to the architect or engineer for review of compliance with design drawings before construction can proceed. These drawings must be detailed using the ACI & CRSI Specifications (United States), ACI & RSIC Specifications (Canada) BS Specifications (United kingdom). Rebar detailing is usually assigned to in- house rebar fabricators or rebar detailing companies. The great majority of rebar detailing companies are stationed in The Middle East and India. The earnings for a rebar detailer in the US and Canada is from $30,000 to $90,000 per year on average but outsourcing is common due to substantially lower wages overseas.

They participate in the NAIA and in the Heart of America Athletic Conference (HAAC).HAAC Members NAIA basketball champions The Ravens won the NAIA Tournament in Kansas City in 1954 and 1967, both under NAIA Hall of Fame coach Ralph Nolan. In 1954, St. Benedict's College (now Benedictine) defeated East Carolina (68‚Äì61), St. Ambrose (74‚Äì50), Pasadena (62‚Äì61) and Arkansas Tech (63‚Äì59) on its way to the championship game. The Ravens defeated Western Illinois 62‚Äì59 at Municipal Auditorium. In 1967, the Ravens entered the tournament as the No. 1 seed. They defeated Linfield (80‚Äì75), Southern Arkansas State (67‚Äì56), St. Mary's (88‚Äì73) and Morris Harvey (73‚Äì70) to reach the championship game. St. Benedict's won its second title with a 71‚Äì65 victory over Oklahoma Baptist. Benedictine has made 11 appearances in the NAIA Tournament, most recently in 2019. The Ravens qualified for the NAIA in 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2019 under coach Ryan Moody. St. Benedict's played in the first NAIA Tournament in 1937 as one of eight teams in the field in Kansas City. The Ravens also qualified in 1953, 1958, 1965 and 1970. The 1965 Ravens advanced to the final eight of the 32-team field. St. Benedict's also won Central Intercollegiate Conference titles in 1953, 1954 and 1958. In 2014, Benedictine made its first appearance since 1970 and won its opening game over Westminster (70‚Äì65). The 2018-19 Ravens entered the tournament with a 30‚Äì3 record. They defeated Westmont (90‚Äì85) before falling to Pikeville 83‚Äì79 in double overtime. The 2018-19 Ravens, coached by Ryan Moody, finished 31-4. They won a school-record 29 games in a row and moved to No. 1 in the NAIA national poll. Benedictine also went 24-0 in Heart of America Athletic Conference play, which is believed to be a collegiate record for most wins in an unbeaten conference season. In 2020, The Kansas City Star named Darryl Jones, a star of the 1967 team, and Nolan to its all- time NAIA Tournament team. Football's rise, fall and return The Ravens own 15 NAIA playoff appearances, including a runner-up finish in 2018 and trips to the semifinals in 1992 and 2001. They made eight appearances in nine seasons between 1995 and 2003. As St. Benedict's, the Ravens made their first appearance in 1958 as one of four NAIA playoff teams. The 2018 Ravens went 13‚Äì2 to set a school record for season victories. They won the Heart of America Athletic Conference North Division title. In the NAIA playoffs, they defeated Cumberlands (48‚Äì41), Concordia (54‚Äì38) and Kansas Wesleyan (43‚Äì21) to advance to the NAIA title game. Top-ranked Morningside defeated Benedictine 35‚Äì28 in Daytona Beach, Fla. More than 3,000 Benedictine fans traveled to the game. St. Benedict's started football in 1920 and the program enjoyed several high points in its early years. The school dropped football after the 1962 season. Varsity football returned in 1973. Coach Larry Wilcox, a former Ravens offensive lineman, took over the program in 1979 and presided over its transformation into a consistent winner and regular NAIA playoff qualifier. The Ravens play in Larry Wilcox Stadium, opened in 1998, on campus. In 1990, the Ravens moved into the Amino Center locker room, offices and weight room. Benedictine expanded the facility in 2004 and 2007. Wilcox was inducted into the NAIA Hall of Fame in 2017. He ranks second among active NAIA coaches with 294 wins (151 losses). He coached the Ravens to 14 of their 15 NAIA playoff appearances. St. Benedict's played in its first bowl game in 1956 under coach Ivan Schottel. The Ravens defeated Northeastern Oklahoma State 14‚Äì13 in the Mineral Water Bowl in Excelsior Springs, Mo. Since resuming football, the Ravens won the 1976 Boot Hill Bowl and the 1991 Steamboat Bowl. They lost in the 1977 Boot Hill Bowl and the 1986 Sunflower Bowl. St. Benedict's won its first conference title in 1940 under coach Marty Peters. The Ravens went 4‚Äì0 in the Central Intercollegiate Conference with wins over Fort Hays State, Pittsburg State, Southwestern and Emporia State. Schottel became coach in 1953 and won or shared CIC titles in 1953, 1956, 1958, 1959 and 1960. The 1958 Ravens went 10‚Äì1, losing to Northeastern Oklahoma in the NAIA Western Playoff. St. Benedict's also enjoyed a notable run of success in the 1930s under coach Moon Mullins. He coached five seasons and went 37‚Äì5-1, capped by an 8‚Äì0 season in 1936. Benedictine played as an independent after resuming football in 1973. It resumed CIC rivalries against schools such as Washburn and Emporia State at times, and also regularly played Missouri Western. After years of lobbying (and a short run in the Tri-State Conference), Benedictine joined the Heart of America in 1992 and shared the conference title with Baker. The Ravens went 9‚Äì0 in the Heart in 1995 to win its second title. It also won Heart titles in 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2013. It claimed Heart North Division titles in 2017 and 2018. Football rivalries with Pittsburg State, William Jewell and Baker Those three schools, in different eras, often marked pivotal dates on the schedule. Pittsburg State was an NAIA power in the 1950s, often battling with St. Benedict's for the CIC crown. Jewell also enjoyed great success in that time as a member of the MCAU and the schools often met in the regular-season finale. Baker and Benedictine heated up as rivals in 1992 when the Ravens joined the Heart of America Conference. While Benedictine no longer plays Pitt State and Jewell (both are NCAA Division II schools), the series with Baker continues as a high point on the schedule. In the 1950s, games against Pittsburg State often decided the CIC title. From 1955‚Äì61, the Ravens and Gorillas combined to win all seven championships. In 1953, the Ravens shared the CIC crown with Washburn. A year later, Fort Hays State won the title to interrupt the SBC/Pitt State dominance. In 1957, Pitt State handed the Ravens their lone loss (17‚Äì13 in Pittsburg), and the Gorillas went 11‚Äì0 to win the NAIA title. In 1958, St. Benedict's defeated the Gorillas 26-19 on its way to the NAIA playoffs. In 1959, St. Benedict's won 13‚Äì12, Pitt State's lone CIC loss. In 1960, the Ravens won again (41-19) to hand the Gorillas their lone defeat in an 8-1 season. The Ravens did not lose a CIC game in 1958, 1959 and 1960. William Jewell, which won seven MCAU titles from 1950 to 1960 also served as an important rival during those days. The 1958 Ravens completed an unbeaten regular season and clinched the NAIA playoff spot with a 21‚Äì20 win over Jewell. A year later, the Ravens again won the season finale over the Cardinals (25‚Äì21) to ruin Jewell's run at an unbeaten season. Again in 1960, the Ravens handed Jewell its lone defeat in the season finale, this time 34‚Äì13. BC's move to the Heart in 1992 helped scheduling and added importance to rivalry games against Jewell and Baker. The Ravens shared the Heart title in its first year as a member, going 7‚Äì1 in the Heart and 11-2 overall. It avenged a regular-season loss to Baker with a 21‚Äì14 win in the NAIA playoff quarterfinals at Amelia Earhart Stadium in Atchison. The rivalry with William Jewell returned to prominence in the 1980s. The Cardinals dominated the Heart early in the decade and made NAIA playoff appearances in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983. They finished as NAIA runner-up in 1982. In 1985, Jewell won the Heart title and played host to the unbeaten Ravens in the regular-season finale. Benedictine won 35‚Äì17 to improve to 10‚Äì0 and wrap up its first NAIA berth since 1958. The win snapped a five-game losing streak to Jewell and signaled a shift in the series. Benedictine went 19‚Äì6 against Jewell since that 1985 game until 2010, when Jewell left the Heart. The series ended with three straight wins by the Ravens by scores of 47‚Äì3, 24‚Äì7 and 21‚Äì0. The rivalry with Baker continues. Like Jewell, Baker was an NAIA power in the early 1980s and presented an obstacle as Benedictine built its program. Either Baker or Jewell (or both) won 12 of 13 Heart of America titles from 1979 to 1991. While Jewell played BC regularly, Baker and Benedictine did not become consistent opponents until the Ravens joined the Heart. The series with Baker hit a high point early with the two meetings in 1992. Conference affiliations St. Benedict's College joined the Central Intercollegiate Conference in 1938. It left the CIC after dropping football in 1962. The basketball team continued to play a round robin schedule against its former CIC rivals (such as Washburn, Emporia State, Fort Hays State and Pittsburg State) into the 1980s. From 1902 to 1928, St. Benedict's was a member of the Kansas College Athletic Conference. In 1988, Benedictine joined the four-team Tri-State Conference, a football-only affiliation that lasted three seasons. For most of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the Ravens competed as an independent in NAIA District 10, which provided post-season competition and individual honors. In 1992, Benedictine joined the Heart of America Athletic Conference for all sports, a group that the school had long targeted for its geographic and institutional fit.

With his background in science, that topic soon became his beat. =Science editor at New York Herald Tribune= Ubell became science editor at the Tribune in 1953 and covered the significant stories of the 50s and 60s. His reporting included an in-depth analysis of the report on female sexual behavior by Alfred Kinsey in 1953, putting the word \\"orgasm\\" on the front page of the Tribune. Ubell reported on the early days of the Space Race, starting with his report on the first satellite to orbit Earth. Ubell reported on the Sputnik 1 launch, starting with the words: \\"Our planet has a new moon tonight\\". He reported on many other scientific advances, including the development of the polio vaccine and the discovery of the structure of DNA. Ubell became well regarded for his ability to translate science into English that a layperson could understand and received several awards, including one from the American Association for the Advancement of Science for his reporting on Steady State theory in an article titled, \\"How Joke Begot Theory of Universe\\". Ubell spent summers working in the laboratories of scientists to increase his scientific knowledge. His research included work with noted scientists at the California Institute of Technology,R. E. Marsh, E. Ubell and H. E. Wilcox, \\"The crystal structure of maleic anhydride\\", Acta Crystallographica, Volume 15, Part 1 (January 1962) Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, Weizmann Institute in Israel, and the Jackson Laboratory in Maine. Ubell earned the respect the scientists he covered, such as physicist Richard Feynman, who praised an article Ubell wrote about a talk given by Feynman on gravity, saying: \\"Usually science reporting is no damn good at all. But the last line ‚Äî ah, there is a man who understands, and says it better than I can!\\"Richard P. Feynman, \\"Perfectly Reasonable Deviations (from the beaten track)\\", page 118, May 2006, Basic Books Ubell's columns also appeared in the Los Angeles Times beginning in 1959.Reprint of Adam Bernstein Washington Post obituary in Los Angeles Times He worked at the Tribune until it merged with two other New York newspapers, triggering a long strike.

It was announced at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 6, 2011, and was released on October 12, 2011. It was succeeded by iOS 6 on September 19, 2012. iOS 5 revamped notifications, adding temporary banners that appear at the top of screen and introducing the Notification Center, a central location for all recent notifications. The operating system also added iCloud, Apple's cloud storage service for synchronization of content and data across iCloud-enabled devices, and iMessage, Apple's instant messaging service. For the first time, system software updates can be installed wirelessly, without requiring a computer and iTunes. iOS 5 also featured deep integration with Twitter, introduced multitasking gestures on iPads, and added an easily accessible camera shortcut from the lock screen. iOS 5 was the subject of criticism for iPhone 4S users, as the initial release had poor battery life, failures of SIM cards, and echoes during phone calls. These problems were fixed in subsequent releases. Apps * Music and Videos (formerly combined in iPod) * Reminders * Newsstand * Siri (4S and up)  History  = Introduction and initial release = iOS 5 was introduced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference on June 6, 2011, with a beta version available for developers later that day. iOS 5 was officially released on October 12, 2011. = Updates =  5.0.1  iOS 5.0.1 was released on November 10, 2011, as the first update to iOS 5. The update included fixes for battery issues.  5.1  iOS 5.1 was released on March 7, 2012 along with the third generation iPad. The update included support for Japanese language for Siri, a redesigned Camera app for iPad, and bug fixes for battery life issues.  5.1.1  iOS 5.1.1 was released on May 7, 2012. The update included reliability improvements for high dynamic range photos, Safari bookmark synchronization fixes, and bug fixes. This was also the last version of iOS for the 1st generation iPad and 3rd generation iPod Touch.  System features  = Notifications = In previous iOS versions, notifications popped up on the screen as dialog boxes, interrupting the current activity. In iOS 5, notifications are revamped, and show up as a temporary banner at the top of the screen. Recent notifications can also be accessed by pulling a \\"Notification Center\\" down from the top of the screen. Users who prefer the old notification system can keep it by choosing the appropriate option in the Settings menu. = iCloud = iOS 5 introduces iCloud, Apple's cloud storage service. The new service allows users to synchronize their music, pictures, videos, and application data across all of their iCloud-enabled devices. = Wireless updates = iOS 5 enables wireless system updates on supported devices, meaning a computer and iTunes aren't necessary to update devices. Both activation of new devices and updates can be done wirelessly. = Twitter integration = iOS 5 features deep Twitter integration. Users are able to sign in to Twitter directly from the Settings menu. Photos can be \\"tweeted\\" directly from the Photos or Camera apps, and users are also able to tweet from the Safari, YouTube, and Google Maps apps. = Multitasking = Multitasking gestures debut on iPad with the release of iOS 5. Multitasking allows users to jump between apps without double-tapping the home button or first going to the home screen. Multitasking gestures were only available on the iPad 2. = Keyboard = The iPad keyboard could be undocked from the bottom of the screen, and could be split into two half-keyboards.  App features  = Photos and Camera = The first iOS 5 release allowed the Camera app to be easily accessed from the lock screen for the first time. Users double-clicked the home button, a camera icon would appear next to the \\"Slide to unlock\\" message, and users would click on it to directly access the camera. The iOS 5.1 update streamlined the process, dropping the home button double-click procedure, but requiring users to swipe up the camera icon. For security purposes when the device is locked with a passcode, this method of accessing the camera only allows access to the Camera app, and no other features of the device. Pressing the volume-up button allows the user to take a picture. = Messages = iMessage, a new instant messaging service built into the Messages app, allowed anyone with an iOS 5 device to send both basic and multimedia messages to anyone else with a compatible iOS 5 device. In contrast to SMS, messages sent through iMessage use the Internet rather than regular cellular texting, but also in contrast to regular SMS, Android and BlackBerry devices are not compatible with the service. iMessages are synchronized across the user's devices, and are color-coded blue, with regular SMS in green. = Mail = The iOS Mail app included rich text formatting, better indent control, flagging of messages, and the ability to drag addresses between To, CC, and BCC lines. = Reminders = Reminders allows users to create lists of tasks with alerts that can either be date- based or location-based. = Newsstand = Newsstand does not act as a native app, but rather a special folder. When selected, it shows icons for all of the periodicals that the user has subscribed to, such as newspapers and magazines. New issues are downloaded automatically. = Music and Videos = The iPod app was replaced by separate Music and Videos apps.  Problems  = Initial upgrade issues = The initial October 2011 release of iOS 5 saw significant upgrade issues, with errors during installation and Apple server overload. = iPhone 4S battery life = Following user complaints, Apple officially confirmed that iOS 5 had poor battery life for some iPhone 4S users, and stated that an upcoming software update would fix the issues. The iOS 5.0.1 update fixed bugs related to battery issues. = Wi-Fi connectivity drops = In November 2011, Engadget reported that the iOS 5 update caused Wi-Fi connection drops for some users. The report also wrote that \\"The recent iOS 5.0.1 update certainly hasn't fixed the matter, either\\", and questioned whether the events were unrelated or part of a larger issue. = SIM card failure = Some iPhone 4S users reported issues with the SIM card in iOS 5, being given error messages about \\"Invalid SIM\\" and \\"SIM Failure\\". Apple released a second software build of the 5.0.1 update designed to fix SIM card issues. = Phone call echo = Some iPhone 4S users reported the random appearance of echoes during phone calls made with earphones in the initial release of iOS 5. The other party in the call was sometimes unable to hear the conversation due to this problem.  Reception  Many aspects of iOS 5 received positive reviews, including the new notification center, the ability to sync and update wirelessly, iMessage, and more. Richmond Shane of Telegraph said \\"iOS 5 is a brilliant upgrade to an already brilliant operating system. Different people look for different things in a mobile operating system. That's why some people prefer BlackBerry, Android or Windows Mobile. I value ease of use and attention to detail in design. With iOS 5, Apple continues to deliver the best user experience available.\\" Richard Goodwin of Know Your Mobile said \\"All in all, we reckon iOS 5 is everything it needs to be a more. We can't wait to get our teeth stuck into it as soon as it's released in the Autumn of 2011.\\" Supported devices With this release, Apple dropped support for older devices, specifically the iPhone 3G and the second- generation iPod Touch. =iPhone= *iPhone 3GS *iPhone 4 *iPhone 4S =iPod Touch= *iPod Touch (3rd generation) *iPod Touch (4th generation) =iPad= *iPad (1st generation) *iPad 2 *iPad (3rd generation) =Apple TV= *Apple TV (2nd generation) *Apple TV (3rd generation)  References  External links Category:2011 software Category:Tablet operating systems ","title":"IOS 5"},{"id":"32001456","text":"Salvia exserta is an annual herb that is native to the Rio Grande basin in Bolivia, and south into Argentina.

The aircraft was named after Chief Oshkosh Development Steve Wittman started air racing in 1926 in various aircraft. In March 1931, he designed his own purpose built aircraft in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, \\"Chief Oshkosh\\". He was racing in Cleveland by August of the same year. His goal was to keep the plane light so that he could be the first to round a pylon and establish position. Design The \\"Chief Oshkosh\\" racer was a mid-winged taildragger with undersized wheels and tires without brakes. The original was powered by an American Cirrus engine, the 1932 racer was outfitted with a 349 Cubic inch Cirrus Hermes. In 1934, a smaller wing was fitted to the plane. In 1936 the plane was fitted with a Menasco CS-4 363 cubic inch engine and multiple leaf spring gear. The wing was also reduced again to . In 1937, a single piece steel landing gear was used, becoming the standard on Cessna aircraft of the future. In 1947 Chief Oshkosh was rebuilt with Wittman Flying Service pilot Bill Brennand to meet the new Professional Race Pilots Association midget racing standards. A Continental C-85 engine was installed and the cockpit was moved up one bay for balance. To meet rules, brakes were installed, but they were non-functional. The aircraft also had to be demonstrated in turns up to 9 gs. Brennand used Wittman's trick of tapping the accelerometer with his knuckles to get the desired reading. The first event was the Goodyear trophy races. \\"Chief Oshkosh\\" was renamed after a cartoon character \\"Buster\\".

It closed to the public in 1979 due to the Lebanese Civil War, and its surviving collections were placed in storage. Restoration of its volumes and planning for a new site began in 1999. History The library was established in 1921, with a donation from Viscount Philippe de Tarrazi of twenty thousand books, many rare manuscripts, and the first issues of national newspapers.. De Tarazi's instructions were that his donation should form \\"the core of what should become the Great Library of Beyrouth.\\" It was placed under the supervision of the Ministry of National Education in 1922.. It moved to the Lebanese Parliament building in 1937. The Lebanese government decreed in 1924 that a copy of every book printed in Lebanon must be submitted, and also provided the library with a staff of eight clerks. A formal copyright deposit law was enacted in 1949 and amended in 1959, but it was never enforced. The government also failed to provide the library with a qualified librarian, or to clearly define its objectives. The library was repeatedly bombed and looted throughout the Lebanese Civil War. At one time, it had a collection of 100,000 volumes and 2,000 rare manuscripts; an unknown number of these were burned or stolen. In 1979, the building was closed and the surviving manuscripts and documents were stored in the National Archives, and modern printed books were stored in a separate building between 1982 and 1983. The Lebanese National Library only existed in name during the 1990s. In 1998, an impassioned plea for a National Library of Lebanon in Beirut is published by the Lebanese Association of Antique Dealers in Lebanon, under the signature of Jean-Pierre Fattal. A movement of sympathy is emerging in favor of the project. The following year, the European Commission decides to send a study mission to Beirut in order to assist the Lebanese government. This mission is immediately followed by an exhibition titled \\"collective memory\\" which was presented at the Sursock Museum in the Lebanese Capital. Its objective was to focus on the importance of the library rehabilitation project. The Lebanese government decides then to install the National Library in the Faculty of Law of the Lebanese University, in the district of Sayaneh, according to plans set by the architect Jean-Marc Bonfils (1963 -2020). Planning for a new site for the National Library began in 1999.. The goal was for the library to contain everything published in Lebanon (around 2,000 books annually) and all publications about Lebanon and the Arab world. The project, which also involved the restoration of the collection, was estimated at $7 million, of which $1.5 million was donated by the European Union and the rest pledged by other governments and private donors. By 2006, more than 3,000 volumes had been restored.. The collection was again threatened during the 2006 Lebanon War by Israeli bombing near its storage facilities at the Port of Beirut.

Morton, BEM (1907‚Äì1996) was a member of the Palestine Police who in separate incidents shot dead two suspects and Avraham Stern, the leader of the militant Zionist group, Lehi, which staged an insurgency against British rule in Palestine during World War II with the aim of creating a Jewish state. The circumstances under which Morton killed Stern were disputed, and the controversy effectively ended his active police work in Palestine. Early life and career Geoffrey Jackson Morton grew up in South London, following grammar school he began work in a dairy firm where his father was managing director, but after becoming a special constable during the General strike of 1926 he decided on a career in law enforcement. Despite lacking the military background which recruiters preferred, Morton succeeded in joining the Palestine Police in 1930, but after passing through the army-style basic training he was assigned to a transport unit. Frustrated at the lack of opportunity for police work he left the force in 1932, rejoining six months later on hearing about changes made by Inspector General Roy Spicer.The Times (London) 23 December 1996, Geoffrey Morton Once Morton had passed his higher language examination in Arabic he received accelerated promotion under Spicer's patronage, reaching the (sergeant-major equivalent) rank of Head Constable at the beginning of the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, only his steel helmet prevented a coping stone from smashing his skull during one riot in Haifa. In 1936 he was awarded the British Empire Medal, he married in 1939. By April 1938 he was an Assistant Superintendent in charge of the Jenin Division. Jenin was the hotbed of rural Palestinian resistance to British rule, along with Nablus and Tulkarm, and Bernard Montgomery praised Morton for discharging his duties effectively while showing a particular talent for rooting out arms caches, sometimes by an imaginative use of ruses which belied his rather solemn demeanor. He was noted for his coolness under fire in several skirmishes although he downplayed this by saying that Arabs were bad shots. The Stern Gang or Lehi The leader of the right wing Zionists, Ze'ev Jabotinsky was ambivalent about reprisals on Arabs but in response to terrorist attacks on Jews the Irgun launched a wave of retaliatory actions, these reached a crescendo on Sunday, 14 November 1937.Shindler,C.,2007, The triumph of military Zionism: nationalism and the origins of the Israeli Right As the Arab revolt wound down Avraham Stern's faction diverged from the Irgun (which ceased operations during the war so as not to give any aid or comfort to Nazi Germany which it regarded as the greatest enemy of the Jewish people), and led his group Lehi on a campaign against Britain's rule. Stern lent heavily on examples from Jewish history such as the Zealots and Bar Kokhba, maintaining that heroism in the face of overwhelming odds would bring success. Opponents accused Stern of being overly influenced by integral nationalism and naive about the danger posed by Nazism; he regarded war between Western democracies and Nazi Germany as \\"a conflict between Gog and Magog\\". Lehi concentrated its armed struggle on the British, Stern claiming that they were the real \\"enemy\\" rather than Germany which was a \\"persecutor\\". Stern had very little support in the wider Jewish community for his violent campaign against the British Mandate for Palestine.The land beyond promise: Israel, Likud and the Zionist dream By Colin Shindler, page 22Heller J., The Stern Gang: ideology, politics, and terror, 1940-1949 page 103-4 The investigation into the 11 April 1938 deaths of two British policemen killed by booby trap bombs planted on a train packed with Arabs found that one Avraham Stern was behind the bombing, it was the first time Morton had heard the name. Morton became head of CID in the Lyddal division covering Arab Jaffa and Jewish Tel Aviv, narrowly escaping death when his automatic pistol jammed during a gunfight with an Arab wanted for multiple murders, he managed to shoot dead his opponent. Although he uncovered several big Jewish arms caches during two years in Lydda division this had no effect on Stern's group. The austerely charismatic Stern, a poet and teacher who was referred to as \\"the light\\" by his followers, became ever more ruthless in his methods and mercilessly targeted Jewish members of the Palestine Police, regarding them as 'hirelings'. In November 1941 Ya'acov Soffioff, an off duty Jewish constable, was shot dead while walking with his wife and young daughter. The gunman was identified as Zelig Jaques, one of Stern's closest associates.A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PALESTINE POLICE FORCE =Yael Street bomb = When his military chief of staff was arrested Stern took personal charge of operations and ordered attacks on the CID officers who were arresting his men, namely Morton and his subordinate Tom Wilkin. To this end on January 20, 1942 a multi-stage operation was mounted. Firstly, a small explosion created the impression that there had been an accidental explosion at a Lehi bomb factory; this lured members of the Palestine Police to Tel Aviv apartment block on Ya'el street, where they were mistakenly identified by the watching Lehi operative as including the intended targets of Morton and Wilkin. Once the policeman were on the roof of 8 Ya'el, pre-placed explosives were electronically detonated from an overlooking vantage point. Deputy Superintendent Shlomo Schiff, one of the most senior Jewish policemen (who Lehi had tried to kill in 1941) died instantly. Inspector Nathan Goldman died the day after. Inspector E. Turton, in his first day of a job in Tel Aviv and holder of the King's Police Medal for Gallantry for saving a trainload of Jewish people from an Arab mob, had his legs amputated before dying a week later. Schiff and Goldman were due to testify against Stern gang members who had murdered two Jewish bystanders while robbing a bank official. Stern's men had also placed a third IED under the walkway to the building's entrance which was intended to target the senior officers arriving on the scene after Morton and Wilkin were killed. When Morton and Wilkins arrived in the aftermath of the rooftop bomb they were recognized by the man delegated to trigger the second IED but, contravening an order to trigger the explosion no matter how many bystanders would die, the Lehi operative did not detonate the walkway IED because of Jewish people nearby.Nachman Ben-Yehuda, Political assassinations by Jews: a rhetorical device for justice.Gannon, J.,Military occupations in the age of self- determination: the history neoconsEli ºav,Ya ªa·∏≥ov, Wanted, 1984 =Morton's subsequent behavior when making arrests= The bombing death of his colleagues demonstrated the Stern gang's thorough knowledge of police procedures, ingenuity in coming up with novel ploys and mastery of improvised explosive devices. The knowledge that CID men were the prime target of explosives expert zealots had a profound effect on Morton's subsequent behavior when arresting Lehi fighters. As a member of the Palestine police he had received pistol training which emphasized instinctive aiming and the danger of quick-reacting suspects; after the Yael Street bomb those who disregarded a warning to stay still during raids were not given the benefit of the doubt but instantly shot.Eli ºav,Ya ªa·∏≥ov 1984 WantedThe Palestine Police Force Close Quarter Battle: Revolvers, Automatics, and Sub-Machine Guns =Dizengoff Street shooting= The authorities offered the large reward of ¬£3000 for information leading to convictions and ¬£1000 for the capture of Stern. One week after the bombing, on 27 January 1942, Morton learned from a Jewish informant that four young men were renting a third floor room at the rear of 30 Dizengoff Street. Morton chose speed and surprise over the delay that cumbersome reinforcements would involve and he raced to the apartment block with only five detectives, on arrival he posted three officers outside and led Wilkin and another CID man to the room. There were three men inside, relaxing after a day of exchanging information on how to make IEDs - Jaques, Abraham Amper (both leading lieutenants of Stern) and Svorai. The fourth man, Yoske, had gone to the lavatory. The noise of the door opening and a voice making a garbled inquiry about \\"Mr. Schiff\\" was taken to be Yoske returning; the three men were caught off guard when Morton threw open the door. By Morton's account, on entering he saw Jaques in front of his wife, two other men were lying on beds; Morton shouted in Hebrew \\"Don't stand up\\". When the suspects did just that he opened fire killing Jaques and Amper, Svorai received flesh wounds, Yoske was shot in the buttocks by a detective outside, while attempting to escape through the lavatory window. The building is now marked by a plaque commemorating the deaths, and the last headquarters meeting of Stern (in which a plan to assassinate Oliver Lyttelton was finalized).\\"This house was the site of the last headquarters meeting of the late \\"Ya'ir\\" Abraham Stern. Two LEHI commanders Abraham Amper and Zelig Jaques were killed in a raid on 27.1.42 by the British CID.\\" friendly fire  Flickr - Photo Sharing!Golan, Z., 2003, Free Jerusalem: heroes, heroines and rogues who created the state of Israel. 2003 Pages 228-9Nachman Ben-Yehuda, Political assassinations by Jews: a rhetorical device for justice. 1993 Lehi member's account of the shooting According to Svorai, Morton burst in with his pistol leveled and yelled \\"Hands up!\\", as the surprised occupants got to their feet and complied he motioned with his free hand for Wilkin and two other CID men to stay back and shot Amper in the stomach three times, Svorai in the shoulder and leg and Jaques twice in the stomach. The Death of Avraham Stern Within a couple of days a guard overheard one of the wounded suspects whispering instructions to the other suspect's mother about getting a message to the rooftop room, 8 Mizrachi Street. This was the home of Tova Svorai and in fact Stern's hiding place. Along with two other CID men, Wilkin went to search the premises on 12 February 1942; to their triumph and apparent surprise Stern was found in a wardrobe. Svorai later said she thought Stern was in danger of being summarily shot by the detective who found him, but Wilkin apparently dissuaded his subordinate from any action he had been considering. Stern was put on the couch, where a burly detective held him by the wrists until handcuffs could be brought, and the room became crowded with armed police.Zev Golan, Stern: The Man and His Gang, Tel Aviv, 2011, p. 44 =Morton's account= According to Morton, on his arrival he feared there were explosives rigged to go off and had the building evacuated. Morton always insisted that Stern was not shot because he 'attempted to escape'. But, because having vowed to blow up himself and the police rather than be arrested, he had made a mad rush across the attic room despite there being no hope of getting away. Morton said that he had shot Stern dead while under the impression he was trying to reach the trigger of an explosive device. Morton was later to win at least three libel actions against those who claimed his averred reason for shooting was a pretext and that had actually murdered Stern in cold blood.Geoffrey J. Morton, Just the Job: Some Experiences of a Colonial Policeman (London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1957The Bookseller, Issues 3941-3944 =Other accounts= According to Lehi member Tova Svorai, Stern was sitting on the sofa manacled while two detectives leveled their guns at his head when Morton arrived and ordered the building cleared. She was taken down to a car, and shortly afterwards heard gunfire.Golan, Stern: The Man and His Gang, p. 44-45 Only Morton and a Constable Tennant were with Stern when he was fatally wounded.Terror Out of Zion By John Bowyer Bell, 1976. p72 Another policeman, Bernard Stamp, later told Israel Radio that in his judgment, Stern was \\"killed by the police force, he was unarmed, no chance of escape.\\"Golan, Stern: The Man and His Gang, p. 45 A Lehi member later alleged he had been told Morton had jerked Stern to his feet and shoved him towards a window, before shooting him in the chest.Heller, Tzila Amidror Behind prison walls: a Jewish woman freedom fighter for Israel's independence. Pages 70- 72 Morton successfully sued four publishers of books which claimed he murdered Stern, including the English publisher of Menachem Begin's book The Revolt.I. Black, \\"The Stern Solution\\", The Guardian, Feb 15, 1992, page 4. =Reprisals against Morton= Morton was given a couple of bodyguards but Stern's disciples made determined efforts to avenge their fallen leader and reportedly made at least two attempts with IEDs. The closest they came was on 1 May 1942 with a huge improvised explosive device containing sixty sticks of gelignite which was hidden in a roadside ditch. It was detonated as a car containing Morton, his wife (who worked in Jaffa as a teacher) and bodyguards passed an orange grove close to their home. Because the car had moved out to overtake a bicycle they were not caught by the full force of the blast and although their car was wrecked the occupants escaped with concussion. A few days later there was a reminder of the danger of explosives which led Morton to fear Stern gang members would blow themselves and the police up when faced with arrest; improvised explosive devices were found in the official cemetery where they had been planted in anticipation of the attendance of dignitaries from the Mandate authority at Morton's interment, had the bomb attack on his car succeeded. In August Morton was told he had been working too hard and was to be sent on extended leave for the good of his health. On his return nearly a year later he was promoted to deputy superintendent but kept away from active service - being given work on film censorship and similar non-jobs. In death Stern, once widely disdained in the Jewish community, had begun to take on the mantle of a martyr. This change in attitude coincided with the threat from the Nazis ending with their expulsion from North Africa; the British were no longer looked on as needed. Morton was treated as an embarrassment to the authorities, especially as rumours about the circumstances in which Stern met his death were widely given credence. Less than a year after returning from Britain Morton had no regrets about leaving Palestine for good. Later life Morton's appointment in Palestine ended in January 1945.The Palestine Gazette, No. 1421, 28th Jun 1945, p755. Later, Morton worked in Trinidad (though even there he was warned that it was likely a further attempt would be made on his life)Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Volume 78, Issues 313-316 before ending his career in 1954 as deputy police commissioner of Nyasaland. He liked Africans and Africa and this was a happy period of service although, unlike some contemporaries, he viewed the Apartheid system of South Africa with considerable distaste. Returning to England he worked in personnel and security at an engineering firm, his memoir Just the Job: Some Experiences of a Colonial Policeman was published in 1957. Morton died at the age of 89; he was survived by his wife, son and a daughter.

As of November 2019, Dunton had around 4000 staff working at the site. Location The entrance to Ford Dunton. Ford Dunton is situated at the junction of West Mayne (B148) and the A127 Southend Arterial Road, in Dunton Wayletts in the district of Basildon. An electricity pylon line straddles the site. In front of the building, to the north, is a vehicle test track. To the south is the Southfields Business Park. The site lies in the religious parish of Laindon with Dunton, formerly in Dunton and Bulphan before 1976. Dunton is a small hamlet to the west, with a former church near Dunton Hall. There is a Ford dealership on the B148 on the north-west corner of the site. In order to promote health and well-being at the site, there are walking routes and outdoor natural areas preserved on the site. There is a picnic area and a pond surrounded by a copse of mixed deciduous trees. The pond is home to many large fish and you can see the protected snail species Helix pomatia. History =Construction= Ford Dunton was constructed by George Wimpey for a contracted price of ¬£6.5 million. The total cost of the centre was around ¬£10 million. The centre originally had of space for design work, making it the largest engineering research centre in Europe. Another development site at Aveley had been opened in 1956 which made prototype cars and spare parts, and closed in 2004.Aveley site closes in 2004 Ford's earlier UK design site was at Dagenham (5 start building) and it previously had seven engineering sites around the UK, with five in Essex; these all moved to Dunton. Ford Dunton was opened by Harold Wilson, then the British Prime Minister, on 12 October 1967. =1967 to 2000= At the time of its opening, Dunton was assigned responsibility within Ford of Europe for vehicle design, interior styling, chassis and body interior engineering, engine calibration and product planning. Ford's Merkenich Centre in Cologne, Germany was given principal responsibility for body and electrical engineering, base engine design, advanced engine development, exterior styling, homologation, vehicle development (ride, handling, NVH) and transmission engineering. This was a 'systems' approach to the engineering process intended to eliminate the duplication of engineering responsibility within Ford of Europe. In the late 1960s Dunton worked on an experimental electric car, first shown on 7 June 1967, and called the Ford Comuta. On 10 May 1971 Peter Walker opened a ¬£1 million engine emissions laboratory at Dunton, the largest of its type in Europe. In November 1974 the world's first automated (computerised) multiple engine (six) test bed was constructed at Dunton, built in co-operation with the engineering department of Queen Mary, University of London. In 1974 a Honeywell 6050 computer was installed at Dunton at a cost of ¬£820,000. The computer was linked to Merkenich and to the Ford test track at Lommel in Belgium. From 1978 Dunton had access to a CDC Cyber 176 computer at the USA base in Dearborn. By 1984 staff at Dunton were conducting video-conferences with colleagues at Merkenich, using the ECS-1 satellite, and enabled by British Telecom International. In 1988 Dunton prepared the way for design of the Mondeo (codename CDW27) by pioneering, in collaboration with Merkenich, the World Engineering Release System (WERS). Dunton at this time was the most advanced automotive development centre in Europe. In 1995 Dunton, in collaboration with the University of Southampton, developed a device which is capable of detecting different types of plastic (for recycling) using the triboelectric effect, including polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). On 16 December 1997 Alexander Trotman, Baron Trotman opened a ¬£128 million environmental engine testing facility at Dunton. =2000 to present= In 2003 a Silicon Graphics International (SGI) Reality Centre was constructed at Dunton, incorporating SGI Onyx 3000 visualisation supercomputers, using the InfiniteReality3 graphics rendering system. In March 2010 Ford announced plans to develop a new generation of environmentally friendly engines and vehicle technologies at Dunton following an announcement by the UK Government that it would underwrite ¬£360 million of a ¬£450 million loan to Ford from the European Investment Bank. In July 2010 the new coalition government confirmed that it would honour the loan commitment, and the contract was signed in a ceremony at Dunton attended by the business minister Mark Prisk on 12 July. In recent years Dunton has been responsible for the development of the ECOnetic range of vehicles, and has contributed to development of the EcoBoost range of engines. Activities Dunton houses the main design team of Ford of Europe, alongside its Merkenich Technical Centre in Cologne. Currently Dunton has responsibility for the design of the Ford Fiesta, the Ford Ka, engines for Ford of Europe (powertrain), commercial vehicles and the interior of Ford of Europe cars. It has facilities to simultaneously test fifteen cars and around one hundred engines. Around 3,000 engineers currently work at Dunton. Ford Dunton is also the home of Ford Team RS, and as part of the Special Vehicle Engineering section of Ford created by Rod Mansfield, developed the XR family of 'hot hatch' vehicles with the Ford Fiesta RS Turbo, more recently becoming the RS family of vehicles. Ford also notably worked in this area of design with Cosworth of Northampton.

A physician by vocation and a German by birth, Ewerbeck is best remembered as an early political associate of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, as a leader of the Parisian communities of the utopian socialist organization, League of the Just, and as the translator of the French writings of √âtienne Cabet and Ludwig Feuerbach into German. Biography =Early years= Hermann Ewerbeck, was born in 1816 in Danzig, Prussia, and graduated from the University of Berlin and the University of Utrecht.Richard Laurin Hawkins, Positivism in the United States (1853-1861). Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1938; pg. 229. Ewerbeck's dissertation, written in Latin and accepted in 1839, was entitled De phaenomenis opticis subjectivis (Subjective Phenomena of Optics).August Hermann Ewerbeck, De phaenomenis opticis subjectivis. Berolini: Schlesinger, 1839. =Political career= Ewerbeck was among the earliest political acquaintances of Karl Marx and Friederich Engels and is mentioned twice by name in the oldest piece of surviving correspondence between the duo, a letter written to Marx in Paris early in October 1844.\\"Engels to Marx in Paris, beginning October 1844,\\" Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Collected Works, Volume 38. New York: International Publishers, 1982; pp. 3, 6. Ewerbeck joined the Paris chapter of the League of the Just (Bund der Gerechten), a utopian socialist organization, and soon became a leading member. In 1847 it was he who translated √âtienne Cabet's influential socialist novel Voyage en Icarie from French into German under the pen name \\"Dr. Wendell Hippler.\\"Dirk Struik (ed.), Birth of the Communist Manifesto: With Full Text of the Manifesto, All Prefaces by Marx and Engels, Early Drafts by Engels and Other Supplementary Material. New York: International Publishers, 1971; pg. 214. In August 1846, Ewerbeck introduced Engels to a small group of Parisian cabinetmakers and tanners who supported the revolutionary movement. Engels was initially smitten by Ewerbeck, characterizing him as \\"very cheerful, completely tractable, more receptive than ever\\" and opined to Marx that \\"he and I will come to see pretty well eye to eye in all things.\\"\\"Engels to Marx in Brussels, 19 August 1846,\\" Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Collected Works, Volume 38, pg. 52. This was not to be, however, as Engels soon developed an aversion to Ewerbeck's ideas, declaring \\"it is disgraceful that one should have to pit oneself against such barbaric nonsense.\\"Francis Wheen, Karl Marx: A Life. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2001; pp. 109-110. Engels specifically objected to Ewerbeck's interest in the ideas of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Anastasius Gr√ºn. Ewerbeck was also the author of German Philosophy and Socialism.Deborah Mutch, ‚ÄúA Working-Class Tragedy: The Fiction of Henry Mayers Hyndman,\\" Nineteenth- Century Studies, vol. 20 (2007), pp. 99‚Äì112. When the League of the Just was dissolved into the Communist League, Ewerbeck thereby became a member of that organization. Ewerbeck was part of a group including Moses Hess and Karl Ludwig Johann D'Ester that tried to get Marx to abandon Engels. According to Oscar J. Hammen, Engels had \\"wounded the sensibilities of other Communists because he was likely to act as the hatchet-man for Marx. As a result he was sometimes impetuous, brusque and even brutal.\\" Their efforts to divide Marx and Engels were not successful. In a letter to Engels, Marx wrote, \\"That I would leave you in the lurch even for a moment is pure fantasy. You remain my intimate friend as I remain yours, let us hope.\\"Oscar Hammen, The Red '48ers: Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1969; pg.

In 1642 Boone was in difficulties with the authorities. The people of Nottingham had submitted a petition to parliament, and Boone had intervened to hinder its submission.

It was announced during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011 press conference. As with the original Sims games, The Sims Social lets the user create their own customizable character. In this version, however, the player uses their character to interact with those of their Facebook friends. The characters can develop likes or dislikes for other Sims, creating relationships that can be publicized on the user's Facebook page. Description The Sims Social was a Facebook videogame developed by Playfish and EA, taking place in a fictional town called Littlehaven. A mobile application for smartphones was in development as a companion app to the Facebook version.Press Release: EA Announces The Sims Social  Infinite Sims The game also features remakes of real life famous people such as Lady Sim-Sim (Lady Gaga), Elvis Plumbob (Elvis Presley), and Sims Cara (Sin Cara). =Skills= Like other games in The Sims series, Sims could develop skills. There were six skills: art, cooking, music, writing, athletic, driving, and various project skill items which were tied with specific themed collections. Developing higher level skill levels allowed Sims to obtain new objects. Sims developed skills when the player interacted with an art object (such as easel or computer when level 30), a music object (such as a guitar or keyboard when level 10), a cooking object (such as a microwave, a coffee maker when level 10, or a stove when level 15), or a writing object (such as a computer or typewriter when level 10). At times, skills were a part of quests given to the player for their Sim to achieve. =Careers= However, careers in The Sims Social were much different than those of previous Sim games. Sims could aspire to three different career paths: Rocker, Chef, and Artist. Each career consisted of 5 levels each with three sub-levels. To advance in their given career players were required to submit appointments for various jobs. After the given appointment time the player could send their Sim to work and earn Simoleons and Career Points. Career Points helped further careers leading to promotions. After each promotion players received a special object only acquirable through a career. Upon completion of an entire career track, players could select a new career track at the cost of forgoing all past career history. =Traits= There were 12 traits for Sims in The Sims Social and could only be purchased with Lifetime Points. All traits featured between three and five levels; each needing to be bought at a higher price of Lifetime Points than the last one. The traits were: Slob, Steel Bladder, Neat, Super Mechanic, Insane, Ogre, Ninja, Great Kisser, Night Owl, Expert Cook, Music Maestro, and Art Virtuoso. When the player upgraded the level of a trait, the trait became more prominent in the Sim's lifestyle. The most visible example of this was in the Ninja trait. When a Sim had the level one Ninja trait, the Sim walked faster. However, when a Sim had the level five Ninja trait, they could teleport from place to place. The Ninja trait was useful if the player had a larger house. In the Insane trait, Sims could reduce the need of being social and could talk to plants without visiting people (in previous versions, talking to plants also eliminated the energy needed to fulfill Social). For example, a level 4 Insane trait let the sim talk to themselves to fulfil Fun and Social need without eliminating energy. Certain career traits, like Art Virtuoso, provided the benefit of earning more Simoleons while using the respective skill object. However, these traits could only be unlocked by reaching specific career levels. =Needs and Energy= In The Sims Social, Sims had needs, just as with other games in The Sims series. However, unlike other games in the series, Sims could not die. There were six needs: Social, Fun, Hunger, Hygiene, Bladder, and Sleep. When all of the needs were fulfilled, the player's Sim became inspired. Inspired Sims earned more Simoleons when performing skill tasks. Sims with a bad mood would not follow the directions of the player. Instead, they fulfilled their own needs by autonomy. All mood meters cycled from deep green (good) to lighter green, yellow, orange, red, and finally gray. All needs could be improved from the Sim's home. Another feature located next to the needs was the fun meter. This could variate largely depending on the Sim's personality. For example, a Sim with an athletic personality would not find playing computer and arcade games as enjoyable as a Sim with a geek personality. Sims took care of themselves using autonomy. If left to their own devices, Sims performed actions that helped out the lowest meter, provided they had an appropriate object nearby. This could not go on extended periods of time, as eventually the game paused and told the player \\"Your Sim Needs You!\\", or to keep playing the game. =Currency= The Sims Social had four currencies: Simoleons, SimCash, Social Points, and Lifetime Points. These currencies were used to purchase items in the game. Simoleons were the most basic currency and could be most readily earned by performing almost any non-autonomous task. SimCash could be obtained by purchasing them with real-world currencies; however, an update to the game permitted users to earn up to 10 SimCash as a reward for playing the game on 5 consecutive days. SimCash allowed the player to purchase special and limited edition objects. When the player began the game, they received 40 free SimCash. Social Points were obtained by performing social interactions with other Sims. These could be used to purchase objects that were not available using Simoleons. You could exchange the Social Points for Simoleons by buying a Social Point item and selling them. Similar to Lifetime Happiness Points in The Sims 3 and The Sims 2, Lifetime Points were a currency only used for buying specific traits. They were the only currency that could not be bought through SimCash but rather earned by completing various quests or levelling up on skill objects. =Social Interaction= Unlike its predecessors, The Sims Social used the socializing features of Facebook to allow players to send and receive gifts in order to finish certain quests or objects. For example, when a Sim levelled up a skill, they needed certain items to unlock the next level. Most of these items were obtained by sending requests to other friends or by interacting with friends' Sims. This proved problematic to players who did not have a large amount of friends. When the player was unable to obtain objects from friends, the only other option was to skip the task using SimCash. Furthermore, certain items, such as double beds and couches, had a hammer icon in the right corner, denoting that 'some assembly is required'. To assemble these items, a player needed certain items that usually could only be obtained by sending requests to friends. Players could pursue three different relationships with their friends' NPCs. They could become friends, rivals, or enter into a romance. There were various relationship levels to be unlocked, going from acquaintances to friends, to BFFs or friendly rivals. Each relationship path gave the player different social interactions, as well as different tasks that could be performed at friends‚Äô homes. For example, rivals could be rude to one another by insulting each other, playing pranks, messing with household appliances, and other negative interactions, once the player reached a new relationship level. Certain relationship levels required the other party to first approve the relationship status before they were reflected in the game. =Crafting= In addition to building items and unlocking skills, players could use items found by performing tasks to craft special potions and complete collections. Players could craft numerous potions that provided benefits to Sims. For example, a Fun Potion instantly maxed out a Sim's fun level, or a Bad Mood potion instantly tanked all a Sim's needs. Depleting needs was helpful when finding certain items. Items could be crafted by going to the crafting section at the bottom of the screen. Other crafting items included free Energy and Simoleons. Hovering over items that were required showed ways to obtain them in-game. Once all of the required items had been obtained, players could click on the crafting button and craft the item. The crafted item was then stored in the player's backpack. Many ingredients could also be gifted to other players. Reception Since its release to the public, the game had accumulated over 65 million players, with over 16 million added in its first week alone. It was one of the fastest growing Facebook games of all time and was the fifth most-used Facebook application in less than a month of release. Starting on September 9, 2011, The Sims Social temporarily became the second-most popular Facebook game. After two months at #2, its decline dropped its ranking, with unfixed glitches and errors and lack of content updates that other top games (like FarmVille) maintain largely to blame. =FIFA Superstars promotional stadium= After The Sims Social has been launched, Playfish had given The Sims Social Stadium for EA Sports FIFA Superstars. The promotion had started at mid-September 2011 that player need to reach level 10 in The Sims Social to claim them, before it is removed. The promotional stadium has been added on September 23, 2011. =November 2012 - The Sims Social drops out of the top 25 facebook games= As of the November 2012 AppData charts (which charts the popularity of Facebook games) the DAU (Daily Average Users) of The Sims Social dropped out of the top 25 for the first time, with many users commenting on Facebook that difficulty achieving goals and repetitive tasks make the game unattractive compared to rivals. Awards On February 9, 2012, The Sims Social won the Social Networking Game of the Year award at the 15th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards and on February 15, 2012, The Sims Social was nominated for best online browser game by the British Academy Video Game Awards - a subsidiary of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Closure On April 15, 2013, Electronic Arts announced that The Sims Social, along with SimCity Social and Pet Society, would be closed down on June 14, 2013. The closures of all three titles occurred 3 days later than expected on June 17, 2013. However, pages for all three games are still in existence.

Background The young baby Gwydion is kidnapped from his castle by one of the castle's staff and brought to Manannan. The boy has a hard life growing up as his slave. As is the tradition, the evil wizard will kill the boy upon his eighteenth birthday. That date is fast approaching, and it is up to Gwydion to thwart Manannan and his brother Mordak's plans, escape and find his way home. When his master isn't watching Alexander explores Llewdor to create spells that will allow him to defeat his master. Along the way he meets the Three Bears, an Oracle, defeats Medusa, and meets other citizens of the country. Once he defeats Manannan and leaves Llewdor, he escapes pirates, an abominable snowman, and defeats a three-headed dragon, meets a wise gnome, saves his sister, all before he can be reunited with his family. Alexander spends weeks helping his father repair the damage to the kingdom. When they are finished, Alexander and his sister are called to the throne room in their finest regalia by their father. The magic mirror is restored and Graham passes his adventure's cap to his son. Some time later, Mordack travels to Llewdor to rescue his brother to bring him back to his island. The evil wizard burns the house, so that none would use it again, and discover Manannan's secrets. Features *All 16 color backgrounds redrawn using a 16bit colour scheme, to match later games in the official series *Enhanced Close up cut-scenes and dialogue pictures help immerse you into what is known as the first plot driven chapter of the King's Quest series *Original music by professional music composer *Re-experience the adventure with a stunning new interface (no more typing) And if you never played well, you'll probably enjoy it anyway *New content includes item placement changes for some of the magic spell items. Streamlined and removal of the magic spell system (all magical spells are automatically prepared and cast without the need of the player to be precise, assuming they have all the ingredients on hand). New close-up cutscenes interspersed throughout the game (such as when defeating Manannan or after climbing up into the mountains). New locations added, which make up the boundaries around the north and south of Llewdor. Daventry is completely reimagined, with new geography, locations and layout. Some of new areas are inspired by King's Quest 5 and KQ1 SCI remake (the staircase is replaced with the suspension bridges in the cave to the Dragon's roost). Many new descriptions and narration on each screen, most of the old replaced or rewritten, some conversations are now extended, or new conversations as well. A new cutscene between Mordack and Mannanan in Mordack's castle during one of his journeys from Llewdor. A new and original prologue story showing one interpretation of how Gwydion was kidnapped, Alexander dreaming, and extended scene with closeups of Manannan talking Alexander overlooking the land below. A completely reimagined oracle scene showing Graham, Valanice and Rosella's decision to be sacrificed and the guards taking Rosella away. A reimagined reunion scene outside of the castle of Daventry after Rosella is rescued. Further changes to the ending which instead of taking place directly before KQ4, it moves events of KQ4 to several months after Gwydion's return. If all points are collected an additional cutscene is seen where Mordack returns to Mannanan's house and burns it down. The magic map's functionality has been changed, that it can only teleport to a few key locations in each area (depending on which release of the game it may not work out at sea at all, with a message saying its magic is limited at sea). Development Infamous Adventures released the game on June 18, 2006. The game was made by the team because they wanted to see if they could do it, and prove they had the drive and ability to recreate the game with updated graphics and sounds. The official announcement for the game read: :That's right, the wait is over. I smile with joy as I type these words in, thinking if this day was ever to come. The production is over, the testers are done and everything is ready to go. King's Quest III has finally been released. Remember this date, the 18th of June. The day KQ3 was released! :It's been twenty years since the evil wizard Manannan first appeared on our computer screens, but now, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the team at Infamous Adventures, he's back! Infamous Adventures decided to remake the remake to create a game that would run on modern computers, and bring it up to the quality of Kings Quest 5. It was made in the tradition of AGD Interactive's King's Quest remakes. Geography *Llewdor: Llewdor is a wild land bounded by an impassible swamp to the north, a crevasse to the south, the desert of Talinor to the west, and the ocean to the east. *Talinor: A dry and dusty great desert lying west of Llewdor. It is home of Medusa (and her sisters), lizards, snakes, and buzzards. A steep rocky cliff borders the entrance to the north. *Mountains *Daventry *Cloudland *Mordack's Island: the strange island were Mordack lives far out at sea. Its grotesque geography seems to defy gravity. Mordack's castle is located at the center of the island. Mananann often travels to the island on business with his brother. They discuss their plans from Mordack's study. Manannan comments that his brother lives in a strange setting unlike his rather normal conditions back in Llewdor. Characters *Gwydion/Alexander: A slave to the wizard Manannan his whole life, Gwydion is the hero of our tale. He must escape the evil wizard and make his way out into the world before the wizard decides he has outlived his usefulness. *Maid: Even the royal family's servants are not above Manannan's influence, and the maid that took young Gwydion proves it. The Maid kidnapped Alexander and brought him to the docks to give to Manannan. She hopes to be rewarded for her treachery, but is quickly wiped out of existence by the evil wizard. She is a new character added to the game, and did not appear in the original. *Manannan: The evil wizard has kept watch over the land of Llewdor for a long time and has had more than one \\"servant\\" to do his bidding. Surely the world would be a better place if someone found a way to turn the old wizard's evil magic against him. Voiced by Andy Hoyos (former Sierra artist and developer on games such as KQ7 and KQV), who did the voice of Mordack in KQ5. *Mordak: The younger brother of Manannan, Mordak is sure to have his own evil abode somewhere in the world. Who knows what evil schemes they talk about when together? Manannan travels to Mordak's island during one of his journeys during the game. Mordack discusses Manannan's plans, and approaching event, of Alexander's demise, and how they intend to return the body back to his parents. Later Mordack returns to Manannan's house to take his brother, and burn the house to the ground. He is voiced by Andy Hoyos, who reprised the role of Mordack from King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!. He is a new character introduced to the game, and did not appear in the original. *Barmaid: She runs the tavern in Port Bruce. *Shopkeeper: A small store in Port Bruce is run by a friendly man and his dog. *Medusa: A creature of countless nightmares, Medusa is said to turn anyone that looks upon her to stone. Travel through the desert becomes much less appealing knowing that she is out there somewhere. Gwydion forces her to look at herself, destroying her. As she turned to stone she called upon her sisters to avenge her. *Oracle: Able to see visions of events throughout the world, the mysterious oracle has no desire to leave her dark cave. What sights would her crystal ball reveal were the young slave Gwydion to visit? *Rosella: The princess of Daventry has many a duty she must attend to. Unfortunately, the duty this time seems to be serving as a sacrifice to the Dragon that is ruining the realm. *Valanice: The queen of Daventry makes only a brief appearance, but what else would you expect from a mother who has lost a child only to have the other be made a sacrifice? *Graham: The king of Daventry has been through a great deal, but it seems there is little he can do about the dragon terrorizing his realm. If only he had an heir that could take up where he left off. Josh Mandel (the developer-producer of King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown remake) reprised his role from previous KQ games. He had previously been the voice of King Graham in King's Quest V and King's Quest VI, and other fan remakes by AGD Interactive (King's Quest I VGA and King's Quest II: Romancing the Stones). *Gnome: A much kindlier being than that encountered by Graham in his search for the royal treasures, this gnome makes his home near Castle Daventry and has a fair bit of knowledge about is happening in the realm. *Kenny: A loyal and friendly pet of the Port Bruce Shopkeeper, the dog enjoys the attention he is given by customers. *Three Bears: These strange bears have made themselves a small cottage in the forests of Llewdor. They don't take to strangers, which is too bad, because they are rumored to make the best porridge around. *Bandits: There are three places that Gwydion may encounter the bandits. It is their duty to steal others belongings and there is always a chance that Gwydion will be the unfortunate target. They are also seen (and possibly overheard) in the Port Bruce Tavern. And of course can be found in their secret hideout *Cat: Manannan's cat wanders all around the house. He and Gwydion don't seem to get along too well so watch out for the hairy thing, and don't forget that a good swift kick may not be out of the question. *Baba Yaga: The witch is not easily found and serves no real purpose in the game. She can provide a quick walk down memory lane if Gwydion does manage to stumble upon her little house. *Chipmunk & Squirrel: Chipmunks and Squirrels frolic about in the forests of Llewdor. Surely they have seen and heard much while innocently collecting their dinner. *Ravens: The forests of Llewdor are home to many different birds. If only we could know what thoughts go on in their tiny brains... *Lizards: Throughout the desert in Llewdor small creatures can be found moving about. With little else to do, the lizards are likely to know a good deal of local gossip. *Chickens: Manannan keeps two chickens in a small coop near the house. The feathery little critters have been around a long time and may know more than poor Gwydion thinks. *Rats: Large ships have always been home to countless vermin. Would that they could tell us how many of the sailors tall tales were really true. *Guard: The Castle Daventry has many loyal men in its employ. We get only a brief glimpse at one of these men. *Pirates: Port Bruce has seen its fair share of pirates.

Morosini, then a sub-deacon, was elected patriarch by the Venetians immediately after the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade and the establishment of the Latin Empire. At first, his election was contested as uncanonical by Pope Innocent III. His tenure was troubled and decreased the Latin Church's prestige. His relationship to the court of the Latin emperor Henry of Flanders was strained due to questions of jurisdiction, accusations of embezzlement from the treasury of the Hagia Sophia, and chiefly due to Morosini's exclusive promotion of Venetian clergy to higher ecclesiastical offices. He also failed to reconcile the Orthodox Byzantine Greeks, both clergy and people, to Catholic rule; instead, they transferred their allegiance to the Empire of Nicaea.

It stars Bradley Cooper, Zoe Saldana, Olivia Wilde, Jeremy Irons, Ben Barnes, Dennis Quaid, and Nora Arnezeder. Cooper, a childhood friend of Klugman and Sternthal from Philadelphia, was also the executive producer.  Plot  Clayton Hammond (Dennis Quaid) attends a public reading of his new book, The Words. Clayton begins reading from his book which focuses on a fictional character named Rory Jansen (Bradley Cooper), an aspiring writer who lives in New York City with his girlfriend, Dora (Zoe Saldana). Rory borrows some money from his father (J. K. Simmons), gets a job as a mail supervisor at a literary agency, and attempts to sell his first novel, which is repeatedly rejected by publishers. After living together for some time, Rory and Dora marry and, during their honeymoon in Paris, Dora buys Rory an old briefcase he was admiring in an antiques store. After returning to America and having his book rejected again, Rory finds an old but masterfully written manuscript in the briefcase with a central character named Jack. Rory types the manuscript into his laptop to know what it feels like to write something truly great, even if it's only pretend. Later, while using the laptop, Dora happens upon the novel and reads it. She mistakenly assumes that Rory wrote the novel and convinces him to give it to a publisher at work, Joseph Cutler (≈Ωeljko Ivanek). After a few months Joseph finally reads the manuscript and offers Rory a contract which he accepts. The book is a hit and Rory becomes famous. At this point, Hammond takes a break from the reading and goes backstage, where he is introduced by his agent (John Hannah) to Daniella (Olivia Wilde), a student and amateur writer who wants to interview him and notes that he is separated from his wife, although he still wears a wedding ring. Hammond agrees to meet her after the ceremony and returns to the stage, where he continues to read the book. The second part of the reading details Rory's encounter with \\"The Old Man\\" (Jeremy Irons) in New York City's Central Park, who reveals himself as the true author of the manuscript and that it was based on his life in Paris. He explains that when he was a young man (Ben Barnes) and stationed in France by the U.S. Army in the final days of World War II, he fell in love with Celia (Nora Arnezeder), a French waitress. They eventually married and had a daughter, but the baby died. Unable to cope with the loss, Celia left him and moved to her parents' house. He then used his pain as inspiration to write the manuscript, which he took to Celia while visiting her at her parents' home. She found the story so moving that she chose to return to him. However, she unintentionally left the manuscript in a briefcase on the train after her trip back to Paris, thereby losing it. Because of the loss of the manuscript, their reconciliation was short-lived, and they divorced soon afterwards. The public reading ends and Hammond tells his fans they must buy the book to learn how it ends. Daniella then accompanies Hammond back to his apartment where she pressures him into telling her the ending. Hammond explains that Rory tells the truth about the creation of the story, first to his wife and then to Cutler. Also, Rory tells Cutler he wants to credit the old man as the true author. Cutler angrily advises against this as it would severely damage both their reputations, and recommends giving the old man a share of the book's profits instead. Rory then seeks out the old man to pay him and finds him working in a plant nursery. The old man refuses the money but, after doing so, reveals that while once riding a train to work, years after his divorce, he spotted Celia with a new husband and a young son at a train station. The old man points out that people always move on from their mistakes, and Rory will too. Daniella continues to pressure Hammond for more details. He reveals that the old man died not long after Rory's second meeting with him along with the secret about who the manuscript's author really is. Daniella deduces that The Words is actually an autobiographical book, with Rory as Hammond's surrogate, and kisses him, reassuring him that people move on from their mistakes, but he pulls away, telling her that there is a fine line between life and fiction. The film flashes back to Rory and Dora in their tiny kitchen, as Rory whispers \\"I'm sorry\\" in her ear.  Cast  * Bradley Cooper as Rory Jansen * Zoe Saldana as Dora Jansen * Olivia Wilde as Daniella * Jeremy Irons as The Old Man * Ben Barnes as The Young Man * Dennis Quaid as Clay Hammond * J. K. Simmons as Mr. Jansen * John Hannah as Richard Ford * Nora Arnezeder as Celia * ≈Ωeljko Ivanek as Joseph Cutler * Michael McKean as Nelson Wyllie * Ron Rifkin as Timothy Epstein * Brian Klugman as Jason Rosen * Liz Stauber as Camy Rosen * Lee Sternthal as Brett Copsey Themes The script includes several references to writer Ernest Hemingway. Rory and Dora view a commemorative plaque to Hemingway during their Paris honeymoon. The plot device of Celia leaving her husband's manuscript in a leather satchel on a train is reminiscent of a similar episode in Hemingway's life, when his first wife Hadley left a briefcase containing all of his writings up to 1922 on a train; the manuscripts were never recovered. Roger Ebert points out the similarity between the name of the character \\"The Old Man\\" and Hemingway's novel The Old Man and the Sea, and the commonality of the name Dora among the wives of novelists.  Allegations of similarity to German novel According to some Swiss newspapers, the plot of The Words is similar to that of the 2004 novel Lila Lila by Martin Suter (made into the German film Lila, Lila released in 2009), which is also about a young unsuccessful author who discovers an old manuscript, is pushed by his girlfriend into publishing it, becomes enormously successful, is later confronted by an old man who is (or in that case, knows) the original author, and then publishes a second book about how this all happened. Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal say that they knew nothing of Suter, his work, or Lila Lila. They had the idea and began writing The Words in 1999, years before Lila Lila was published. Together they attended the 2000 Sundance Screenwriter's Lab with their original screenplay.  Production  = Filming = Filming began in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on June 7, 2011 for a period of 25 days. The Montreal location was used because it could pass as both Paris and New York.  Release  The Words had its world premiere at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Prior to its official premiere and following a press and industry screening at Sundance, the film was purchased by CBS Films for $2 million with a $1.5 million print and advertising commitment. The Words grossed nearly $11.5 million in North America and $1.7 million worldwide, against a production budget of $6 million.  Reception  The Words received mostly negative reviews from critics, as it currently holds a 22% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 117 reviews with a weighted average of 4.6/10 and the consensus stating: \\"Neither as clever nor as interesting as it appears to think it is, The Words maroons its talented stars in an overly complex, dramatically inert literary thriller that's ultimately a poor substitute for a good book\\". At Metacritic, the film received 37 out of 100 with generally unfavorable reviews from 30 critics. Jen Chaney from The Washington Post gave the film 1.5 out of 5 stars, saying it \\"is a well-acted but narratively limp indie that‚Äôs undermined by a failure to connect emotionally with its audience\\". Chris Pandolfi from At A Theater Near You praised the film, saying that while its \\"ambiguity is unlikely to be appreciated by everyone,\\" it \\"deserves to be structurally, emotionally, and thematically analyzed\\". Stephen Holden of The New York Times also praised the film as \\"a clever, entertaining yarn\\".

The street runs east-west, connecting with St Aldate's to the east and St Ebbe's Street to the west. History Originally, the area was occupied by butchers and slaughters, giving it the name Sleyng Lane (in 1478). The lane became known as Sleyne Lane (in 1690), Slaying Lane (in 1811), Slaughter Lane (in 1840). In 1772, it became Brewer Street and Lane. In 1932, the street was marked with a sign of \\"Brewers Street\\" at the St Aldate's end and \\"Brewer Street\\" at the St Ebbe's end. The latter was adopted on 14 January 1932. The current street name derives from a brewhouse in the location, dating from the 17th century. Institutions Campion Hall, a Permanent Private Hall of the University of Oxford, is on the south side. The hall is run by the Society of Jesus. It is the only building in Oxford designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and was opened in 1936. The building was Grade II* listed in 2000. Rose Place is further to the south. Christ Church Cathedral School, associated with Christ Church Cathedral and College close to the school on the other side of St Aldate's, is located at 3 Brewer Street. The school educates the choristers for the cathedral and college. The house of Cardinal Wolsey, the founder of the college, is still used for teaching. Pembroke College, one of the colleges of the University of Oxford, is on the north side of the street, with its main entrance in Pembroke Square. Part of the city wall is preserved in the exterior wall of Pembroke College on Brewer Street. Other parts can be found in the gardens of New College and Merton College. In 2010, Pembroke College began a major new development south of the main site, to which it is linked by a bridge over Brewer Street. The new buildings were expected to be completed in 2012.

Sudie who finds to her surprise and pleasure that black people are not all nine feet tall, that they know what they do, and that their skin color doesn't rub off. Moreover, the gentle, harmless and moral character of Simpson is contrasted with a white teacher who molests his students. The themes of racism and morality are compared and contrasted, dramatically. If the whites, who \\"don't allow no niggers\\" in town, discover the presence of Simpson, they will likely expel him or lynch him.

The major information discovery steps include: managing the entire data collection in a manner to identify all pertinent evidence associated with the matter, targeting that information for collection (forensically or otherwise), processing and identification (culling) of relevant data, and processing for document hosting and legal document/information review. Global organizations deal with legal discovery and disclosure request for electronically stored information ‚ÄúESI‚Äù and paper documents on a regular basis. The massive emergence of evidence in electronic format, and the emergence of entirely new forms of evidence, present a number of cultural, practical, and legal challenges to both corporations and their law firms. Managing the massive amounts of information involved in a legal matter can sometimes be tedious and expensive. Information Discovery although a similar term for manage document review (attorney document review, document review) and/or Electronic Discovery (e-Discovery, eDiscovery) is more encompassing to the entire process involved in identifying relevant information within a legal matter. A number of software tools and service providers exist today that assist in and help facilitate the process of information discovery including early case assessment ‚ÄúECA‚Äù tools, hosting platforms, cloud services, and managed document review firms. Corporations are also looking at ways to defray the expense associated with information discovery by looking at bringing solutions in-house or by insourcing through a third party service provider oftentimes requiring customization for the client involved.

Background Henry had served in the Bedfordshire Police force for three years prior to his death, and worked previously as a floor fitter in the Luton area. He married Mary in 2005 and had an infant daughter, Maggie. Murder At around 7:18 am on 11 June 2007, having begun his shift at 7 am, Henry responded to 999 calls reporting a stabbing on George Street in Luton town centre. A window cleaner, Stephen Chamberlain, had been stabbed in a random attack. Henry approached the suspect from behind to attempt to arrest him but was stabbed in the chest with a 4¬Ω-inch knife; he was stabbed a second time as he lay on the ground wounded. Another window cleaner, David Knight, struck the suspect over the head with a window cleaning pole. Police back-up officers then used a baton round and two shots from a Taser to subdue the suspect. Henry was taken to Luton and Dunstable Hospital by ambulance but later died of his injuries. Conviction Paranoid schizophrenic Ikechukwu Tennyson Obih, a 29-year-old Nigerian immigrant, was convicted of Henry's murder on 26 March 2009 and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum tariff of 25 years. Obih abused alcohol and cannabis and from 2004 he heard voices and hallucinations and had delusions. During his trial the jury heard how Obih believed that he had special powers, could predict the future, and could make something explode just by pointing at it. He also distrusted the police. Obih had denied the charge of murder, but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The jury rejected this defence and found him guilty of the murder of Henry, the attempted murder of Chamberlain and the wounding with intent of Knight (he was found not guilty of the attempted murder of Knight). Obih was also convicted of aggravated burglary and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in a separate incident on the same day. The judge accepted that Obih's schizophrenia was a mitigating factor in the case, and recommended that he receive psychiatric rehabilitation at a high-security mental hospital. Memorial In 2008 the Police Memorial Trust erected a stone memorial to PC Henry near the location of his murder in George Street, Luton. Present at the unveiling was the Trust's founder Michael Winner and the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

(The Devil's Brigade) was an American tank crew joining up with a British tank crew, and they were roaming the North African desert. (I didn't even realize it at the time, I was using an advanced tank called The Centurion, which didn't come out until 1947, but I was younger and stupider then.) They were similar to the LRDG, the Long Range Desert Groups, which in reality, fought in trucks. But the series was just a shallow kind of series, just action-adventure. I never got anywhere strong with it, and I was kind of relieved when I got a call saying \\"We're dropping the War Heroes title, so we don't need 'The Devil's Brigade' anymore.\\" Initially, they doubled-up \\"The Devil's Brigade\\" in Fightin' Army with \\"Willy Schultz.\\" \\"The Lonely War of Capt.

During combat in the European Theater, U.S. Army captain Schultz (a German American) is falsely accused and convicted of murder; he escapes and blends into the German Army while seeking a way to clear his name and retain his Allied allegiance.

Despite an initial inclination to kill Schultz at the end of the war, Franz instead had him go off with the daughter of a German general to start a new life. \\"The Lonely War of Capt. Willy Schultz\\" debuted in Charlton's Fightin' Army #76 (Oct. 1967), and was serialized through issue #92 (July 1970). Selected stories were reprinted by Charlton many times thereafter. Following Charlton's dissolution in the 1980s, stories were collected by Avalon Communications/America's Comics Group in the 1999 miniseries The Lonely War of Willy Schultz #1‚Äì4 (May‚ÄìNov. 1999), with the script credit now reading Willie Franz. One was reprinted, along with an \\"Iron Corporal\\" story and Charlton war-comics stories by others, in the Avalon one- shot Star Combat Tales #1 (2000; no cover date). Critic Mark Evanier observed In 1970, Franz left Charlton and, for the most part, the world of professional comics. = Later career = In 1972, Franz had one short piece, \\"Slave,\\" published in the DC Comics anthology Weird War Tales #5 (May‚ÄìJune 1972). In the 2000s, Franz re-teamed with \\"Willy Schultz\\" artist Glanzman on the Roman centurion series The Eagle, portions of which were published in the comics anthology Negative Burn. In late 2007, Franz was ill and having difficulties paying his medical expenses. Franz's \\"Willy Schultz\\" collaborator Glanzman auctioned pages of original art from the series to help finance Franz's expenses. As of summer 2011, a recovered Franz was teaching writing and hosting event nights for Independence Care System, a nonprofit organization for Medicaid patients with long-term disabilities and other health issues.

Several rare plant species occur and the site is of particular importance for its maritime heath. At the last site assessment on 12 August 2010, the SSSI was described as ‚Ä≥Unfavourable recovering‚Ä≥ because scrub and bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) encroachment are diminishing the interest, and the site needs to be grazed. Removal of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) would enhance the site as well as the control of other invasive species.

The maritime heath is dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris), bell heather (Erica cinerea) and western gorse (Ulex gallii). Maritime grassland occurs on the steeper cliff slopes and is dominated by red fescue (Festuca rubra), with spring squill (Scilla verna), wild carrot (Daucus carota), kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria) and sea plantain (Plantago maritima). The Red Data Book western clover (Trifolium occidentale) and the nationally rare hare's foot clover (Trifolium arvense) grow here as well as hairy bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus subbiflorus) and bird's-foot fenugreek (Trifolium ornithopodioides). Large areas are covered by scrub, dominated by gorse (Ulex europaeus) and blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) and provide habitat for invertebrates and birds. Common dodder (Cuscuta epithymum) parasitises the gorse. A number of wet flushes occur along the coast dominated by common reed (Phragmites australis).

Genome-wide linkage analysis of 15 Japanese families of autosomal dominant moyamoya disease narrowed down the locus to 17q25.3. Direct sequencing of the region and whole-exome sequencing identified the p.Arg4810Lys mutation in RNF213 gene as a founder mutation of moyamoya disease.

Comparative evolutionary genome sequencing analyses in humans and monkeys showed that the strongest evidence for acceleration along the branch leading to hominines was RNF213. RNF213 has been shown to be associated with blood flow and oxygen consumption.

Illustration: Commons user Finnrid Interior of Husby Chapel, which was built on the command of proprietarian Nathalie Gidtske as a gift to the local community. Photograph: Commons user Finnrid The Husby Estate (Norwegian: Husbygodset) is an estate in Helgeland, Norway. It is based in the village of Husby on the southwestern part of the island of Tomma in the municipality of Nesna.  History  = Christensen family = Anders Christensen the younger (1751-1821), a shipper and a tradesman, and otherwise a great-great-grandson of the noblewoman Margrete Jonsdotter Benkestok, started in 1806 buying properties in Lur√∏y. He bought altogether twelve parts of the farms Gr√∏nningen, Kvitv√¶r, Lunder√∏y, M√•sv√¶r, Sandv√¶r, Sengstrag, S√∏r-Nes√∏y, and Troll√∏y. In 1819 he bought a part of Husby Farm, which until then had been a part of the D√∏nnes Estate. After Christensen's death his widow Anna Catharine n√©e Bernhoft continued buying properties. In 1825 she bought altogether nine parts of farms in the districts Mel√∏y, R√∏d√∏y, and Lur√∏y. In 1833 she bought altogether twelve parts of farms in Lur√∏y. In 1834 she bought much land in the district Tr√¶na. Later followed the purchases of the trade seat Lur√∏ysj√∏en, the trade seat Lauv√∏ya, and √Ökvik Farm. Their son Frederik Christian Bernhoft Christensen (1800-1869) took over the Husby Estate. He was succeeded by his son Anders Christensen the younger (1840-1901). Anders Christensen married Johanne Marie Coldevin, the daughter of Isaach Coldevin, who was the owner of the considerably bigger D√∏nnes Estate. With her were 67 farm parts added to the Husby Estate. The estate thereby grew to consist of approximately 190 farm parts, making it a medium-sized estate in Northern Norway. The couple's two daughters, Frederikke Christiane Christensen (1867-1887) and J√∏rgine Catharine Christensen (1872), did not reach adult age, wherefore the estate stood without heirs. Johanne Marie Christensen died in ca. 1895. In 1899 the widower Anders Christensen married Nathalie n√©e Finchenhagen (1873-1955). Anders Christensen died in 1901, whereupon the widow inherited the estate. Nathalie had the Husby Chapel built to serve the local population in 1905.Helgeland Museum: Husby Kapell = Gidtske family = In 1910 Nathalie Christensen married Karl Olaf Johan Karlsen Gidtske (1865-1948), a priest and a cand.theol., who thereby became the owner of the Husby Estate. During his time as a proprietarian some of the estate's many farms were sold, partly voluntarily and partly due to forced cession. When their son Kaare Krey Gidtske (1912-1995) in 1944 took over the estate it had been reduced to 50-60 farm parts of the original 190. Whatsoever, Gidtske continued selling away. In 1974 even Husby Farm was sold. The son of Kaare Gidtske and Kirsten n√©e Jacobsen (1923-2009), Karl Gidtske the younger, is today's estate owner and as such one of the biggest landowners in the County of Nordland. In the 2000s some properties belonging to the estate were sold out of the family. Kaare Gidtske's widow, Kirsten Gidtske, would not accept this, wherefore she in 2007 used her right of preemption and bought the properties back for 5,500,000 crowns. To the newspaper Rana Blad she stated that she had bought the properties so that they shall remain within the family.Rana Blad: Eiendommene blir i familienNorwegian: Det er jeg som har kj√∏pt eiendommene.

The Steaz brand, headquartered in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, is currently owned by the privately held Healthy Beverage Company. History In the 1990s, prior to the founding of Steaz, both Schnell and Kessler were employed at Country Life Vitamins. The business was described as fledgling, but produced a somewhat profitable organic bottled tea product called Long Life Tea. Based on this success, the observation that soft drinks were being removed from schools, and the growth in organic products in the United States, Schnell and Kessler decided to pursue the possibility of creating an organic tea-based soda product. In 2002, The Healthy Beverage Company was founded by Schnell and Kessler, but their products would be sold under the Steaz brand name. Their first major product was Steaz Green Tea Soda, which was the first USDA Organic certified soda. All Steaz products have since been Certified Organic by Quality Assurance International (QAI) and Fair Trade Certified by TransFair USA. Initially, Steaz products were found only in local groceries and natural food markets. In 2005, Steaz signed an agreement with distributor Polar Beverages, which allowed their products have to become available in some supermarkets. In 2014 and 2015, Steaz also became available at Costco and Target stores. In September 2011, Steaz announced its partnership with Whole Planet Foundation to help fund the Foundation's mission to provide entrepreneurs in developing countries with microcredit loans.Steaz Pledges $15,000 to Non-Profit Whole Planet Foundation to Help Fight World Poverty Products Steaz produces several varieties of canned organic green tea drinks and energy drinks, which include flavors such as peach and mint. All products are made using certified fair trade green tea from Kenya, certified fair trade and cane sugar from Paraguay. Reception and awards Steaz products have met with generally positive reception. For instance, FastCompany and Greenopia have considered Steaz to be one of the most eco-friendly beverages available. Formal reviews of their individual products have generally been positive, although some have noted that Steaz products have similar caloric and sugar content per serving compared to traditional soft drinks such as Coke. In 2007, Steaz was presented with the Socially Responsible Business Award. In the same year, Inc.

Fenwicke published his first book, The Law of Mind in Action, in 1919. When Dr. Julia Seaton Sears, noted New Thought lecturer and author, had urged one of the brothers to attend the International New Thought Alliance in Boston, Massachusetts, and Fenwicke attended. Soon after Seton had Fenwicke appointed as a special lecturer at the League for the Larger Life in New York City. Fenwicke is attributed as the director of a 1921 film called The Offenders.

After that he ministered at the Divine Science Church of the Healing Christ in New York City until 1934. Then, Fenwick and his wife moved to Santa Monica, California, where he became president of the International College of Mental Science and continued lecturing. In the 1950s, Holmes collaborated with Dr. Masaharu Taniguchi in founding the Japanese New Thought organization Seicho-No-Ie, and co-authored its guiding book, The Science of Faith.

He was president of the Denver Tramway Company. He oversaw the completion of the Moffat Tunnel and worked for four years on the City Beautiful project of Mayor Robert Walter Speer. He owned the Byers-Evans House, now the Byers-Evans House Museum, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Early life and education Born in Evanston, Illinois on December 16, 1855, he was the oldest child of John Evans and Margaret Gray Evans. He moved with his parents to Denver, Colorado in 1862 when Abraham Lincoln appointed his father, John Evans as Colorado's territorial governor. They lived in Denver at 14th and Arapahoe streets. Career Denver Tramway streetcar, 1909 Evans, his father John Evans, William Byers, Roger Woodbury and Henry C. Brown incorporated the Denver Tramway Company in 1866. William Evans served as secretary and later president of the Denver Tramway Company. Under his leadership, the Denver Tramway became a monopoly in the Denver area, putting horse railway and streetcar companies out of business. The tramway company then installed electricity-driven streetcars in every Denver neighborhood. Travel by tramway was essential within the city because most people did not have horses and carriages. Aside from a means of transportation for daily life, they were also used to transport caskets to the Riverside or Fairmount Cemeteries or were rented out for weddings. He oversaw the construction of the Denver Tramway headquarters at 14th and Arapahoe Streets, on the site of John Evan's family home. The building is now the Hotel Teatro. Moffat Tunnel Evans was instrumental in building the Moffat Tunnel. He worked with David Moffat in financing the project in New York. Evans was with David Moffat at the time of his death in 1911, and the Grand Valley News described him as \\"the mainstay of Mr. Moffat in his railroad building and other enterprises for a number of years.\\" After David Moffat's death, he took over Moffat's positions as president of the Denver, Northwestern & Pacific Railway as well as president of the Colorado-Utah Construction Company. Taking over Moffat's former offices allowed him to continue the work the two men had started in negotiating the terms of the Moffat Tunnel's construction. The tunnel, which provided railroad service between Denver and the Western Slope, was completed in 1927. The first railroad train through the tunnel was from the Denver and Salt Lake Railway. Evans was also influential in Denver politics in the first years of the twentieth century, and counted Denver Mayor Robert W. Speer and University of Denver chancellor Henry Buchtel among his personal friends. He is said to have \\"controlled Denver's political machine for many years. Between 1909 and 1913, Evans worked on Mayor Robert Walter Speer's plan for a City Beautiful, which involved creating parks throughout Denver. The plan for the parks was created the Evans family in 1894. He retired in 1913. Personal life Byers‚ÄìEvans House, Denver, about 1889, when the Evans family members were photographed. It was the home of William Gray Evans beginning 1889. In 1900, Margaret Gray Evans and her daughter Anne Evans moved into the house. He was married to Cornelia Lunt Gray (1863-1955), his first cousin and the daughter of William Patten Gray. His mother Margaret Gray Evans and William Patten Gray were sister and brother. Cornelia and William had four children, John, Josephine, Margaret, and Katherine Evans. John was the president of the First National Bank of Denver. William Gray Evans' home at 1310 Bannock Street in Denver is now a historic house museum, operated as the Byers-Evans House Museum. After the death of his father John Evans on July 3, 1897, William transferred the deed to the Byers-Evans House to his wife. Cornelia's father, who was a widower, moved into their home about 1897. A two-story addition with an elevator was added to the house in 1900 for his mother Margaret Gray Evans and his sister Anne Evans who moved into the house. Anne remained in the house after Cornelia and William's death. Evans family members lived in the house until 1981. He died on October 21, 1924 in Denver, and he was buried at Fairmount Cemetery.

Early life Mac Con Iomaire was raised in the Connemara Gaeltacht village of An Cheathr√∫ Rua, the eldest of three children of Tom√°s Mac Con Iomaire and Mair√©ad. He is a brother of Donncha Mac Con Iomaire and S√≠le Nic Con Iomaire. =Career= Mac Con Iomaire was educated at Scoil Chuimsitheach Chiar√°in, and studied BA in Journalism in Dublin City University (DCU). While at university, he was editor of the college newspaper and contributed to a number of other university publications. He began his journalistic career as a news feature writer with the Evening Herald and also worked for the Irish Independent. In 1996, with the opening of Teilif√≠s na Gaeilge, Mac Con Iomaire took up a role as video journalist with Nuacht TnaG. Two years later, he returned to Independent News & Media as a freelancer, while also working as Dublin Correspondent for the Irish language newspaper Foinse, and as an editor for the Telecom √âireann (now eircom) online publication Cumasc. He was also a contributor to various publications such as Magill and The Irish Times during this period. In 1999, he co-founded the communications company, meas media, along with Breand√°n √ì hEaghra, and became managing director of the company, focussing mostly on the expanding web industry and the Irish language sector. During this period, he also became involved in the hospitality trade, taking out a lease on two Galway city public houses, An Gob Fliuch and de Burgo's. In 2002, he returned to television journalism and was appointed Local Government correspondent for Nuacht RT√â and Nuacht TG4, where we won a number of awards for his journalism. In 2004, he won an ESB National Media Award for his investigation of planning irregularities. In 2006, he was awarded the Oireachtas Journalist of the Year award following his revelations regarding a personal fund-raising dinner in Manchester for the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern. While working for RT√â, he worked on a number of documentaries. The well-reviewed UEFA sa Ghaeltacht, which saw Mac Con Iomaire as presenter and writer, told the story of a UEFA Cup soccer match being played on a Gaelic football pitch in rural Connemara. \\"Tr√°laer\\" looked at life aboard a deep-sea pelagic fishing trawler from the Aran Islands, which was again presented and written by Mac Con Iomaire. Saighdi√∫r looked at the role of Irish citizens in the British army during World War II, where Mac Con Iomaire used the case of his grand-uncle, Paddy Ridge, to illustrate the story. Ridge was killed while serving in the Irish Guards in Tunisia in 1943. Mac Con Iomaire shot, co-directed, wrote and presented Saighdi√∫r. He was appointed Leascheannaire (deputy head) of Ireland's national Irish-language radio broadcaster, RT√â Raidi√≥ na Gaeltachta, in 2011.

In 2019, he became Director of Regional & Community Development & Language with √ödar√°s na Gaeltachta. =Writing= Mac Con Iomaire is the author of Rocky Ros Muc (Cl√≥ Iar-Chonnachta), a biography of Irish boxer Se√°n Mannion, who fought for the light-middleweight world championship in Madison Square Garden, New York in 1984. The book looks at how Mannion, who won the US light-middleweight title in 1983, escaped a future as one of Whitey Bulger's henchmen and climbed his way to the top of the rankings in what was one of the most competitive weight divisions in boxing history, and how drink and depression put an end to his ambitions of glory. US publishers Rowman & Littlefield published Mac Con Iomaire's second book, The Man Who Was Never Knocked Down, in 2018, an English-language telling of Se√°n Mannion's story. The book, which was well-reviewed, was initially launched into the North American market before being released in Ireland and the UK. Rocky Ros Muc was developed as a feature-length documentary by Below the Radar TV in 2017, and has won awards at the Boston Irish Film Festival, the Galway Film Fleadh, and the Celtic Media Festival, among other awards. Mac Con Iomaire was associate producer and contributor. Along with being the first Irish-language documentary to be long-listed for the Oscars, and achieving a cinema release in both the US and Ireland, Rocky Ros Muc received numerous positive reviews. R√≥n√°n Mac Con Iomaire was awarded the New Writer of the Year award for his work on Rocky Ros Muc at the Oireachtas Literary Awards in October 2013. He is a contributor to Sc√©al Sc√©il, an insight into the way the modern Irish journalist operates. Sc√©al Sc√©il, edited by Breand√°n Delap will be published by Cois Life in 2014.

Cazeneuve was founded in Paris by Andr√© Cazeneuve in 1905 and produced steel wool for grinding and cleaning floors. He had designed a specialized lathe to turn out the long, even and sharp chips needed for this purpose. In 1920 the company was in dire straits economically. The technical director Henri Bruet took over ownership of the company in exchange for unpaid wages. He started manufacture of lathes of the series LO with overhead belt drive. The son of Henri Bruet was also named Henri. He attended the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'arts et m√©tiers, and became a mechanical engineer like his father. His diploma thesis was the design of the lathe HB, named after his own initials. This model came into production after Henri graduated, in 1949. The HB was revolutionary for its time. 40 000 machines were produced in the course of 50 years. From 1959 to 1973 Cazeneuve also manufactured the HB series at its own factory in northern Tokyo. Approximately 6000 units were sold to Southeast Asian and American customers. This series was also made under license in Spain at the Amutio works. From 1950 to 1964 Henri Bruet was issued a series of patents for novel mechanisms and arrangements for use in lathes. Most of these ideas found their way into a very unconventional, courageous and beautiful design: The 360 HB-X (x for experimental). This lathe had a belt variator actuated by a hydraulic servo arrangement, so that infinitely variable spindle speed was available by pushing a small lever on the right side of the apron. The hydraulic pump also lubricated the spindle and feed gearboxes. There was proper shielding of the operator from chuck contact, coolant and flying swarf. Both leadscrews ran in sealed oil baths. The apron was of a totally novel design. The leadscrew engaged with a worm wheel instead of the usual halfnuts. The apron gear system could engage every metric and imperial thread directly and automatically. The leadscrew could be disengaged for each cut without losing register. This made it easy to turn and thread directly against an endstop, even into blind holes. Accordingly, the lathe was equipped with an assortment of endstops both for the saddle and crossfeed. The endstop trip mechanism had a sensitive adjustment. There was a foot-operated emergency stop and spindle brake. The tailstock was also of completely new design. The quill could be fed by three different methods: Rapidly by a large starwheel, by worm reduction via a smaller handwheel, or automatically by geared connection to the saddle. The transverse adjustment of the centre was done by an eccentric mechanism. The centre was protected from overload by a spring arrangement. The Cazeneuve HBX 360 was marketed from 1965. Production of the first 50 units started at La Plaine St Denis and in Ruchon. From 1968 it was built at a new, dedicated factory at Pont √âv√™que. Around the same time (in 1967) the Japanese Cazeneuve factory in Osaka (Osaka Kosakucho) began manufacturing the HBX 360 for the Japanese market, about 50 units per month. This production lasted until 1976, and from 1970 they also produced the larger but similar model HBY 590 there. Due to high demand on the French domestic market around 1968, about 200 HBX lathes were imported from Japan between 1968 and 1969. These machines differ from the French model in some details, particularly the electrical equipment and motor. The HBX 360 was also made under license in Brazil for the local market. Henri Bruet became very debilitated by Parkinson's disease. He left his position as technical director at Cazeneuve in 1972. In 1983 the company went through bankruptcy, and was bought and restructured by the CATO group. Henri Bruet died in 1992. The HBX 360 was still offered in its original, manual form with only cosmetic updates until 2008. J.

Manufacturer When more locomotives were required for passenger traffic on the Natal Government Railways (NGR) mainline on the section between Estcourt and Charlestown on the Transvaal border, where gradients were less severe than in the coastal region, two Pacific type locomotives were built in the Durban workshops of the NGR and equipped with Type TJ tenders. The locomotive was designed during 1907 by NGR Locomotive Superintendent D.A. Hendrie as a redesigned version of his NGR Class A Hendrie A of 1905. Characteristics D.A. Hendrie The Hendrie C, as it was popularly known, was similar to the Class A Hendrie A in general proportions, but with Walschaerts valve gear, larger diameter coupled wheels, a larger boiler with a higher boiler pressure and a more enclosed cab which offered better protection to the crew. They were equipped with Hendrie's steam reversing gear and had wide Belpaire fireboxes, carried down between the rear frames which had been widened by using a bridle casting. The cylinders were mounted horizontally since the Walschaerts valve gear did not require inclined cylinders like those on the Class A Hendrie A with its Stephenson valve gear. The coupled wheels were later retyred to a larger diameter, from .

Although the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways were only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912.The South African Railways - Historical Survey.

A veteran in the food truck industry, Don Chow was founded on April 22, 2009 by Dominic Lau and Lawrence Lie. Their motto, ‚ÄúWhere Chino meets Latino‚Äù, represents the pair's Chinese heritage, (represented by the truck's logo, a depiction of the traditional Chinese guardian lion), and the Hispanic influences that had been constant in their lives as they grew up in LA. Don Chow Tacos ceased operations on February 16, 2015. Don Chow has appeared on the Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, as well NBC and KTLA. Don Chow is also set to appear on the Cooking Channel's \\"Chinese Food Made Easy\\" for offering some of the best late-night street food in Los Angeles.  History  Don Chow Tacos food truck The idea for founding the truck was conceived when owners Lau and Lie identified a foodie niche in the late-night bar-goer crowd. When they decided to found Don Chow Tacos, the food truck industry was in its infancy. The name they chose to represent their fusion tacos, Don Chow, was derived from the honorific Spanish title \\"Don\\" in combination with the popular Chinese surname \\"Chow\\", (which also became a play-on-words for being synonymous with \\"food\\"). Don Chow began as a two-man operation, with Lau and Lie cooking and serving bar crowds on Thursday and Friday nights, as well as anyone else who encountered the truck on weekends. They appeared regularly at Zanzibar in Santa Monica and Townhouse in Venice. Both kept their day jobs, working after regular business hours to get Don Chow up and running. When the truck transitioned to a full-week schedule in October 2009, Ernie Gallegos was hired to manage a cook to take over for Lau and Lie. With Gallegos‚Äô guidance, Don Chow was able to establish regular operations. Sales took off after Guy Fieri sampled Don Chow's fusion fare on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on June 21, 2010. Earlier that year, Don Chow had been recognized on NBC's Food Truck Week on the truck's first birthday: April 22, 2010, and Dominic Lau was interviewed by Kurt Knutsson, \\"Cyberguy\\" for KTLA in May. As its popularity continued to grow, Don Chow was featured on a segment for National Taco Day on KTLA on October 4, 2010. Don Chow Tacos and owner Lau were featured on the Cooking Channel's show \\"Easy Chinese\\" hosted by Ching-He Huang in June 2012. The episode focused on late night street food. Lau prepared one of Don Chow's signature dishes, the Chinese BBQ Pork taco, while Huang prepared a spicy oyster omelet \\"Taco\\". In July 2013, Don Chow Tacos' owner Dominic had the opportunity to participate on the Lifetime Network's reality competition show Supermarket Superstar. Lau won his episode (Episode 2 Category \\"Global Cuisine\\") with the Kung Pao Chicken Chimale and went on to be a finalist in the show's final episode.  Cuisine  Don Chow Tacos' taco The Don Chow truck serves a variety of traditional Mexican food with Chinese flavors drawn from Lau and Lie's family and friends‚Äô recipes. Items on the menu include tacos, burritos, tortas, ‚ÄúChimales,‚Äù and noodle dishes. Some of their most popular dishes are their Kung Pao Chicken Tacos, Chinese BBQ Pork Burritos, and ‚ÄúChimales‚Äù, (traditional tamales stuffed with their own Chinese style meats). Other signature dishes are their Carne Asada Chow Fun and ‚ÄúUltimate LA Tacos‚Äù ‚Äì carne asada tacos topped with bacon ‚Äì which were inspired by the bacon-wrapped hot dogs that pervade tailgating parties during the football season at USC, (both Lau and Lie's alma mater). All food is prepared and cooked to order by the staff on the truck. Excepting their signature dishes, the menu remains flexible and rotates depending on its location. Additionally, the truck offers several secret off-menu items.  Events  The mobility of the food truck has enabled Don Chow to cater to a variety of Californians and their lifestyles. The truck makes regular appearances at events such as the Los Angeles Outdoor Cinema Food Fest, the LA Street Food Fest, and farmers' markets. Balancing fun and profitability, Don Chow appears at a variety of catered events in addition to being on the streets. Past catered events have included the sets of the Food Network's Giada at Home and the film No Strings Attached. Don Chow gives back to the community, participating in fundraisers and charity events for local schools and other causes. The truck has collaborated multiple times with Cal State LA to benefit their Urban Learning Program and participated in charity events for the 2009 Typhoon Ondoy in the Philippines and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Don Chow also partnered with KTLA's news anchor Wendy Burch and the Good News Foundation to rebuild the Gilbert Lindsay Park in Los Angeles, providing free lunches for all volunteers on May 29, 2010. Don Chow is regularly commissioned to appear at special events. On April 16, 2011, Don Chow Tacos catered Lacoste L!ve at Coachella, which included celebrity guests including Katy Perry, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and Ke$ha. Don Chow received especially positive reviews from indie rock band, The Strokes. Don Chow made an appearance at Cal State Northridge's \\"Big Show\\" on October 3, 2009, where performers included Far East Movement and Lupe Fiasco, as well as the following year on October 2, 2010, when the talent included LMFAO and Kevin Rudolf. In September 2010, Don Chow participated in the Los Angeles Times Celebration of Food and Wine. Technology had been vital to the growth Don Chow experienced soon after its founding, and continues to attract a technologically savvy audience to the truck.

She was the daughter of musical composer and haute couture textile supplier Robert Perrier, from whom she inherited direction of the R-26 artistic salon. Early life and singing career Born in the Montmartre district of Paris in 1924, Marie-Jacques Perrier was raised among the regulars of her parents‚Äô R-26, the informal artistic salon based in the family's apartment and frequented by artists such as Josephine Baker, St√©phane Grappelli, Django Reinhardt, Henri Salvador, Jean Tranchant and Mary Lou Williams.Moulin, Matthieu (2007).

Leveraging her father's contacts within the fashion industry, Marie-Jacques Perrier became employed in 1955 as an English-language journalist for the Paris office of Fairchild Publications, partnering her with the budding illustrator Kenneth Paul Block. Her contributions from Paris, London and New York City to the company's Women's Wear Daily and the Daily News Record soon became extremely popular, earning Perrier's reputation as one of Fairchild's most distinguished journalists of haute couture. Perrier earned wide acclaim for her interviews with many of the decade's most fashionable women, including Jacqueline Kennedy, Est√©e Lauder, Princess Margaret and Farah Diba Pahlavi.

She was also one of the first to feature interviews with many future luminaries, among them James Galanos, Karl Lagerfeld, Yves Saint Laurent and Emanuel Ungaro. Perrier was a member of the Fashion Group Paris alongside colleagues Eugenia Sheppard and Diana Vreeland. Throughout Perrier's career, she maintained a close professional relationship with designers such as Pierre Cardin, Andr√© Courr√®ges and Givenchy, contacts that were much in demand by Perrier's publishers.Cheverny.

Perrier then moved to Los Angeles to work as a foreign correspondent and freelance for The Hollywood Reporter, though the birth of her daughter encouraged Perrier to return to Europe. Later writing for a variety of publications in Paris, London, Milan, Sydney and Buenos Aires, she continued to report on haute couture shows, interviewing a new generation of then up- and-coming designers including Calvin Klein, Thierry Mugler, Oscar de la Renta and Kenzo Takada.Ramos, Barbara. \\"The Jazz Singer: Madame Perrier.\\" The Peacock.

This structure consists mainly of three buildings: Seabury Hall, Northam Towers, and Jarvis Hall. History Trinity College in 1909, showing the Long Walk and three attached buildings: Northam (center), Jarvis (right), Seabury (left) The buildings were the first group of buildings constructed on Trinity's Gallows Hill Campus after the College's move in the 1870s from its downtown campus which is currently the site of the State Capitol. \\"In an ambitious gesture, then President Abner Jackson chose William Burges, one of England's leading architects, to design the new buildings. Burges never traveled to the United States, and Francis Hatch Kimball served as the local architect. The Long Walk was executed in the High Victorian Gothic style, popular in England and the United States in the second half of the 19th century. The Long Walk set the pace for the appearance of the campus's future buildings. Burges had wanted the buildings to be arranged in quadrangular fashion, but his plans were drastically cut back to form a long bar-like range, whose bold silhouette dominates the central green space of the campus known as The Quad.\\" There are two markers on the long walk commemorating presidential visits. The first, commemorating a 1954 visit by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, is marked in a Greek inscription within a triangular planting and is located in front of Downes Memorial Clock Tower. The second marker, commemorating the 1918 visit of President Theodore Roosevelt, is midway down the Long Walk and adjacent to the Fuller Arch and the Wall of Honor. The Latin inscription is embedded in the sidewalk in front of Northam Tower. Tradition has it that any student who walk on the plaque will not graduate from Trinity. When graduating seniors process at commencement, they all walk on this plaque. In 2008 the Long Walk underwent a $32.7 million renovation. The Long Walk is the only example of Burges's work in America and is considered to be one of the best example anywhere of Victorian Gothic collegiate architecture.  Seabury Hall  Built in 1878, Seabury Hall is named after Samuel Seabury, the first American Episcopal bishop, the second Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, USA, and the first Bishop of Connecticut. This section of the Long Walk contains seminar rooms, class rooms and professor's offices. Originally, Seabury contained the Trinity's chapel. The former chapel room has since been renovated into a lecture room, maintaining the pews for student seating.  Jarvis Hall  Built in 1878, Jarvis Hall and is named after Abraham Jarvis, who was the second American Episcopal bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut and eighth in succession of bishops in the Episcopal Church. Jarvis is used for student housing and contains rooms that are made up of six and eight person suites consisting of single and double rooms. Each suite has two or three bathrooms and a large common room. It is rumored that the doubles were originally designed for students while the singles across the hallway were intended for their servants. In actuality, the single rooms were single bedrooms that opened into living areas, which are currently the doubles and the hallway, and six rooms retain this layout. As of the 2008 school year, the massive Long Walk Reconstruction project was completed, and the dorms are built in a classic style. The basement of Jarvis contains student meeting and study rooms.  Northam Tower  This is the central tower on the Long Walk, with its distinctive Fuller archway. Northam was built after Seabury and Jarvis Halls and was meant to connect to the two buildings. It contains upperclassman housing in the form of one and two room doubles. The National Fraternity of Alpha Chi Rho was founded in a room within Northam Tower. Under the Fuller archway is the Trinity College Wall of Honor, which lists important benefactors of the school.

Day was an English carpenter and wheelwright. With the financial support of Christopher Blake, an English gambler, Day built a wooden \\"diving chamber\\" without an engine. He attached his invention to the deck of a 50-ton sloop named the Maria, which Blake had purchased for ¬£340. The sloop's hold contained 10 tons of ballast, and two 10-ton weights were attached beneath the keel which could be released from inside the diving chamber. An additional 20 tons of ballast would be loaded on the Maria after Day had been locked inside the diving chamber. Day bet with Blake that he and his boat could descend to a depth of and stay underwater for 12 hours. On 22 June 1774,This date comes from The Book of Days. According to Churchill and McCartney, Day's fatal dive occurred on 20 June 1774. the Maria was towed to a location north of Drake's Island in Plymouth Sound, off Plymouth, England. Day took a candle, water and biscuits on board. The boat was equipped with a hammock for the passenger. After the boat was locked, the weights were loaded and the boat sank forever into the depths. Day had the calculation of the trim completely wrong. It has been speculated that Day may have died from asphyxiation, hypothermia or catastrophic structural failure of the Maria and/or the diving chamber due to water pressure. This incident was the first recorded fatal accident involving a submarine.

Originally operating as a flotilla, it was split in two during the latter part of the war. The Flanders flotilla was constituted in March 1915 at the port of Bruges in occupied Belgium. Commanded by Karl Bartenbach, the force comprised nine UB- and seven UC- type U-boats, small mass-produced coastal types suited for operations in the closed waters of the Channel and the North Sea. UB boats were prefabricated in Germany and brought in sections to Bruges and assembled. The boats used Zeebrugge and Ostend as exit ports; UC minelayers joined in late 1915. Throughout the campaign the Flotilla grew, though losses also remained high, as the unit bore a considerable proportion of the trade war () around the British coast. During 1916 12 boats were lost; in 1917 this rose to 29 boats, 9 UB- and 20 UC-type. In October 1917 the force was split into two full flotillas and Bartenbach, now a , was made flotilla leader (, FdU). The 1st Flanders Flotilla, under K/L Walther, comprised 8 UB- and 12 UC- boats at its formation. during the next twelve months 10 UB- and 5 UC- boats were lost. With replacements the unit strength in 1918 was 16 UB- and 9 UC- boats. The 2nd Flanders Flotilla, led by K/L Rohrbeck, comprised 12 UB- and 12 UC- boats; 12 Ub- and 4 UC- boats were lost but with replacements its strength in 1918 was 17 UB- and 7 UC- boats. Towards the end of 1918 the base at Bruges was abandoned as the German armies on the Western Front retreated. The surviving boats of the flotillas were surrendered at Harwich in November 1918.

It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on June 8, 2011. In the episode, Stan begins to develop a profound sense of cynicism after celebrating his tenth birthday, where he is literally seeing everything as \\"crap\\". Meanwhile, Randy latches onto a new music genre, \\"tween wave,\\" in an attempt to fit in, which causes problems in his marriage with Sharon. The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker and was produced at the end of the show's \\"spring\\" run. He and co-creator Matt Stone had created the idea of Stan's existential crisis as a parallel with their own real-life aging. \\"You're Getting Old\\" ends abruptly; Stan's parents separate and his problem remains unresolved. The conclusion was inspired by modern television dramas, which are often serialized and are less likely to have the standard \\"happy ending.\\" The episode created significant media attention, and was interpreted by some critics as a metaphor for the frustration experienced by creators Parker and Stone stemming from the show's continued production; other critics, and several viewers, speculated on whether the episode was meant as a series finale. The episode received very positive reviews from contemporary television critics, who praised the episode's ending and overarching theme on growing older. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 2.29 million viewers the week it was broadcast. The episode's ending is continued in the mid-season premiere, \\"Ass Burgers\\", which aired in October 2011. \\"You're Getting Old\\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray along with the rest of the fifteenth season on March 27, 2012. Plot At Stan Marsh's tenth birthday party, his present from Kyle Broflovski is the latest CD from a \\"tween wave\\" band, but Sharon forbids Stan to listen to the CD and promptly takes it away, enraging him. After Randy argues with Sharon over the matter, he decides to sit down and listen to the CD (which, to the viewer and the adults, is the sound of drum beats and defecation). Randy claims to enjoy the CD, but Sharon does not believe him. As tween wave music becomes popular, Sharon and the other boys' parents forbid them from listening to any of it, and try to play for them The Police's song \\"Every Breath You Take\\" as an example of what they consider to be good music. To the boys and the viewer, however, it literally sounds like people defecating on the soundtrack, just as the \\"tween wave\\" music is presented as sounding to the adults. That night, Stan secretly listens to the confiscated music but discovers, to his confusion, that it now too \\"sounds like shit\\". Stan goes to the doctor, who, after examining him, diagnoses him as a \\"cynical asshole\\". From ice cream to movie trailers, Stan can now only see the bad in things, and this negative outlook alienates him from Kyle, Kenny McCormick, and Eric Cartman, who begin avoiding him. When Stan catches them secretly going to the movies without him after lying about having the flu, he comes along, only for his attitude to ruin the trailers and Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman leave the theater. Cartman then coldly informs Stan that they do not want to hang out with him anymore and leaves with Kenny. As Stan and Kyle argue over this, Stan literally sees Kyle as a large piece of feces that defecates instead of talking, indicating that he sees them as \\"shit\\". Realizing he now sees them as he does everything else, he just walks away. Sharon accuses Randy of merely feigning interest in modern music in order to hold onto his childhood dreams of being a musician, and deny that he is getting older. Randy, however, ignores her, and starts performing tween wave music at the local bowling alley under the name \\"Steamy Ray Vaughn\\", with flatulence as part of the act. During a duet with a woman billing herself as \\"Steamy Nicks\\", Sharon catches Randy at the bowling alley, resulting in an argument. She excoriates him for the various schemes and fads that he has often briefly taken with over the years, such as getting into fights at baseball games, playing World of Warcraft, and becoming a celebrity chef, but Randy reveals that he is unhappy, and has been for a long time. The two agree that while they are both unhappy, they do not feel the same about each other any more. Two old farmers, who previously watched Randy perform, overhear the argument and break into the Marshes' home to steal Randy's underwear, believing that they are acting humanely on its behalf. As Fleetwood Mac's song \\"Landslide\\" plays, Sharon and Randy separate and sell their house, with Stan, Sharon, and older sibling Shelly moving into a new home. The police arrest the farmers and recover Randy's underwear. A new friendship appears to develop between Kyle and Cartman, who share a smile while playing video games together (a bonding activity Stan and Kyle once shared). Stan, now completely alienated from his friends, shows no signs of his cynicism ending. Production Creators Trey Parker (left) and Matt Stone (right) reportedly dreading working on South Park prior to production, leading some critics to view the episode as a commentary on itself. \\"You're Getting Old\\" was the final episode of the spring run, which contained the first seven episodes of South Park fifteenth season. The first element of the episode's plot line to be crafted was Stan's tenth birthday and his feeling of getting old, as a reference to Parker and Stone's own aging (at the time of the episode's broadcast, Stone had just turned 40 and Parker was 41). They decided to make a two-part episode, with the second half airing at the beginning of the fall run, set to begin in October 2011. Parker and Stone did not write the second part until they reconvened in the fall. Another idea from which the episode was crafted was the fictional \\"tween wave\\" genre: initially, the episode would have found the genre enjoyed by all citizens of the town of South Park, not just a younger audience. By Sunday, completed animated shots were being edited together and set to the song \\"Landslide\\" by Fleetwood Mac. The song's use in the episode was unsure until Tuesday night, when they eventually received clearance to use it. Parker noted later that they had backup songs to use if necessary, but none fit as well as \\"Landslide\\". They were very satisfied with the ending, feeling it provided a very emotional conclusion to the show. In addition, the episodes contains what Parker describes in the commentary as \\"our favorite thing of any South Park ever\\": the Duck President, who communicates by spraying feces from his mouth. \\"Every time in the retake room when Duck President was on, shitting, quacking and shitting, we just thought it was the greatest thing ever,\\" he remarked. The dialogue between Sharon and Randy that would provoke significant attention was not scripted until Tuesday morning, less than 48 hours prior to broadcast, and was one of the last completed parts of the show. Parker likened the scene to an afterthought, as he felt it was not necessarily central to the episode's story. Themes Co- creator Trey Parker likened Randy's dilemma with the Hans Christian Andersen short story \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\". The episode's main theme has been described as \\"universal and timeless, but also specific and personal: growing up and dealing with change.\\" The episode makes it clear that Stan's pre- adolescent battle with cynicism is not necessarily representative of all \\"tweens\\"; one reviewer described the character's problem as more common to depression. The episode also mocks how \\"cynical culture breeds cynical audiences,\\" typified in the \\"contemptuous trailers\\" for predictable films during the scene set at the cinema, which often end with the insult \\"Fuck you!\\" Sean O'Neal, in the episode's review at The A.V. Club, linked the episode's theme to modern culture: \\"The Internet has turned nearly everyone into a cynic.\\" Time reviewer James Poniewozik disagreed with his assessment, but did note that \\"there's definitely an argument that the instant dissection of all experience online encourages a kind of protective dismissiveness.\\" The episode was also interpreted as a satire of immediate online responses from fans, who criticize South Park as stale but continue to watch regardless. South Park generally ends on a positive note and \\"resets\\" upon the next episode, in which way it is connected to traditional television sitcoms, as it does not serialize or employ story arcs with frequency. An example of this format is best characteristic of the show's early years, in which the character of Kenny was killed in each episode. In contrast, the stark, abrupt ending of \\"You're Getting Old\\" was inspired by modern television dramas, in which events can go poorly, and the episode ends regardless. The character of Sharon references this in one of the episode's final moments, criticizing, on a meta level, the show's form and reliance on \\"happy endings.\\" Stone likened this structure to an \\"immature view of the world\\": he remarks in the episode's DVD commentary that things do not often end on a \\"happy\\" note in real-life. Likewise, the dialogue between Sharon and Randy near the end of the episode functions as a meta-comment on the show's general form, which is consequently broken. A central element of the episode's plot line concerns the fictional \\"tween wave\\" genre of music, which consists of audible flatulence and defecation in a literal sense. In the episode, children love tween wave while adults are generally repelled by it; this joke serves as a commentary on generation gaps. In this sense, Parker related it to the plot line of the Hans Christian Andersen short story \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\". Reviewers interpreted the episode's use of literal feces as just a simple example of the show's use of scatological humor, but also a comment on the dismissiveness of things vulgarly described as \\"crap\\" or \\"shit.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix interpreted the final dialogue as a criticism of those lacking passion, and also an observation on the show's recurring philosophy, which he described as the exact opposite: \\"how other people care too much about things, and that many of our big problems and scandals would go away if everyone could just relax and feel less passionate.\\" Cultural references The episode makes a reference to the 2011 films Mr. Popper's Penguins and Jack and Jill, the latter an Adam Sandler comedy notable for its extremely poor reception. Its inclusion in the episode was actually based on the film's trailer. Reviewers suggested various different musical genres as the \\"tween wave\\" genre parodied in the episode, including dubstep, crabcore, and chillwave. In addition, prior to the episode's broadcast, Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times predicted \\"tween wave\\" would be a spoof of the hip hop group Odd Future, who were also receiving heavy media attention at that time. In his desperate attempt to fit in with popular music, Stan's father, Randy, forms his own tween wave act: \\"Steamy Ray Vaughan,\\" a pun on the blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan, who collaborates with singer \\"Steamy Nicks,\\" a pun on Stevie Nicks, vocalist from Fleetwood Mac. The episode also makes reference to the 2011 video game L.A. Noire, and an arcade machine for the game Custer's Revenge appears in the background during Randy's musical performance at the bowling alley. Reception =Media coverage= Comedy Central's press release prior to the airing of the episode alluded to its significance, stating: \\"After Stan celebrates his 10th birthday, he begins to see everything differently... The very fabric of South Park begins to unravel.\\" Coinciding with production and performance of the Broadway musical The Book of Mormon produced by the South Park creators, there had been speculation over doubt within the writing team on the future of South Park. Following the episode's broadcast, it received significant media attention due to its ending and themes. Much of the conversation centered on the final scene of dialogue between the Marshes, with Entertainment Weekly noting it could be \\"a not-so-thinly-veiled way of Stone and Parker telling us they had a similar discussion about their very show.\\" Critics pointed to a March 2011 profile in The Hollywood Reporter, in which they spoke at how they dreaded to return to producing South Park: \\"I don't know how we're going to do it. It's a nightmare.\\" \\"Knowing that Parker and Stone have been experiencing a bit of an existential crisis or even just restlessness definitely made tonight seem unusually thematically heavy,\\" remarked Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club. Parker and Stone were in New York to attend the 65th Tony Awards, when they were requested for interviews and had to answer questions at press junkets regarding the episode. On June 15, 2011, Parker and Stone appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, where they denied being unhappy with the show and stated that they still enjoy producing episodes. Parker commented that, while the episode did deal with some issues they had with the show, they particularly enjoyed creating \\"You're Getting Old\\", and that despite not knowing what upcoming episodes would be about, they would figure it out upon resuming production in August 2011. \\"Looking back at it, it kinda does look like we‚Äôre kinda saying we don't want to do this anymore, but it's not really what we were saying,\\" said Parker in the episode's DVD commentary. =Critical reception= In its original American broadcast on June 8, 2011, \\"You're Getting Old\\" was watched by 2.295 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. Reaction to \\"You're Getting Old\\" was positive. Critics pointed to the self-referencing aim of the episode in growing older and redefining senses of humor as well as cynicism. While Ramsey Isler of IGN found the episode to be largely humorless and monotonous, he interpreted this as intentional on the part of the show's creators, who he believed had grown weary of creating the series. Isler called the final moments of the episode \\"the most somber material the series has ever produced... providing the emotional soundtrack for a montage of images that just rip the heart out of any South Park fan\\", giving the episode an 8.5/10. HitFix's review on the episode focused on its personal philosophic themes, with reviewer Alan Sepinwall stating \\"But what was interesting about Stan's existential crisis, and how he struggled to like anything, is that the show's philosophy has often largely been about how other people care too much about things... Yet here, Stan's lack of passion ‚Äì and the Marsh parents' ‚Äì was clearly shown to be a bad thing for them.\\" Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club commented on the \\"finality\\" of the episode, noting that although the creators were still under contract until 2013, \\"there are already scores of people questioning on IMDB boards and Twitter whether it was, in fact, a surprise series finale.\\" O'Neal saw the use of the Fleetwood Mac song \\"Landslide\\" (the only song in the episode that does not feature the sounds of defecation) in the episode's closing moments to have served as \\"both a parody of a self- serious drama's season finale and an actual, self-serious, dramatic season finale.\\" James Poniewozik of Time remarked that the episode moved him to tears, commenting that it is \\"one of those episodes that managed to combine the many different things lesser South Park episodes do individually: pop- culture parody, scatological hilarity and stories about childhood.\\" He described the dialogue between the Marshes as \\"stunningly genuine,\\" summarizing the episode as \\"simultaneously one of the most juvenile episodes South Park has ever done, and possibly its most mature.\\" In December 2011 Time magazine ranked the episode at #7 in its list of Top 10 TV Episodes of 2011, with James Poniewozik commenting, \\"With no easy wrap-up to Stan's depression and ending with an entirely unironic montage set to 'Landslide', South Park showed that it too can grow up ‚Äî if, thankfully, not by much.\\" References =Footnotes= =Sources= * External links * \\"You're Getting Old\\" Episode guide at South Park Studios * \\"You're Getting Old\\" Full episode at South Park Studios Category:Midlife crisis in fiction Category:South Park (season 15) episodes Category:South Park episodes in multiple parts Category:Television episodes about divorce Category:Cultural depictions of Adam Sandler Category:Television episodes about birthdays ","title":"You're Getting Old"},{"id":"32003717","text":"Makararaja chindwinensis is a freshwater stingray found in the Chindwin River, a tributary of the Irrawaddy, in Myanmar.

Nashville Shores is located adjacent to Interstate 40. The site was previously the location of Hermitage Landing, a marina, campground, and recreational complex that opened in 1971. Hermitage Landing closed in 1997, and the Nashville Shores waterpark opened on the property one year later. In 2009, Nashville Shores was sold to investors Kieran Burke and Gary Story, two former Six Flags executives. The resort is owned and operated by Premier Parks, LLC. Nashville Shores' normal operating season runs from early May to early August. The waterpark then reopens only on weekends until late September. The park features 8 water slides and 3 pools. History =Hermitage Landing= In the Summer of 1971, C.E. Hooper and business partner Robert Baltz opened Hermitage Landing, a marina, campground, and recreational complex on the shores of Percy Priest Lake. Hermitage Landing was built on land leased from the United States Army Corps of Engineers, who was responsible for the construction of Percy Priest Lake. The Landing became a very popular destination for tourists and locals, Hermitage Landing also began to host the \\"One For the Sun\\" rock festival in 1984, which attracted 11,000 people and would return on a yearly basis. =The first decade= The waterpark viewed from across the lake The Hermitage Landing complex closed in 1997, and the Nashville Shores waterpark opened on the Landing's property the following year, with two waterslides. In December 2003, Nashville Shores announced plans to build an amusement park to complement their waterpark, they also mentioned that they were having trouble getting approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, but they hoped to work something out. Hermitage residents voiced skepticism and opposition about the planned construction of an amusement park, which led to the project being canceled. The Nashville area had not had an amusement park since Opryland Themepark closed in 1997. In 2008, the park opened Music City Racer, a six- lane, 350 foot long, racer slide, with a top speed of 35 mph. =Premier Parks era= Nashville Shores' attendance declined in 2009, and owner Mike Williams began looking to sell the park. In November, Nashville Shores Holdings, headed by former Six Flags CEO Kirean Burke and former Six Flags executive Gary Story, bought the waterpark. In December, the new owners announced to new additions to Nashville Shores for 2010; Breaker Bay Wave Pool, a 25,000 square-foot wave pool capable of holding 400,000 gallons of water, and Castaway Creek, a 1,000 foot long lazy river. In early May 2010, shortly before the beginning of the summer season, Nashville Shores was flooded during the 2010 Tennessee floods, however, the park was not seriously damaged and Nashville opened as scheduled later that month. In December 2010, Nashville Shores announced that the park would open Kowabunga Beach in 2011, a four- story water treehouse with four waterslides, a bucket that spills hundreds of gallons of water every few minutes, and various water play elements. Nashville Shores also renovated the campground and lakeside cabins in 2011. The new additions to campground were new hookups for water, sewer, and electricity, Wi-Fi, a playground, new RV sites, a refurbished bathhouse, a laundromat, a dog park, and other improvements. In 2012, Nashville Shores opened Treetop Adventure Park, an adventure course separate from the waterpark, featuring suspended bridges, zip lines, and other obstacles. Nashville Shores opened the Big Kahuna in 2015, a $2 million family raft ride that is 57 feet tall, and 530 feet long. In 2017, Barefootin' Bay, a children's water play structure with mini-slides and a tipping bucket, was added to the waterpark. To celebrate the waterpark's 20th anniversary, Nashville Shores added the Aqua Park in 2018, an interactive playground on the lake with 40 water elements. The park also improved the beach area, adding new cabanas, more shaded areas, a tiki bar, a beach volleyball court, and more sand. On November 14, 2019, the Nashville Shores announced that they would be adding Mega Mayhem in 2020, the largest waterslide addition in the park's history. Mega Mayhem is a six-story family raft ride from ProSlide Technologies, that features two distinct elements, a tornado funnel and a four-story wall. On March 24, 2020, Nashville Shores announced that they planned to open the waterpark on May 16 instead of May 2, as originally scheduled. This change was made due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, the park said that they would not open on May 16 or give a specific opening date, but said that they hoped to open in early June. As a result, Nashville Shores also announced that they would be open for an additional week of operation in August and an additional weekend of operation in September. On June 5th, 2020, Nashville Shores announced their reopening on June 10th, 2020.

Early life Forsh was born in the fortress at Ghunib, in Daghestan, the daughter of a major general in the Russian Imperial Army. Her father met her mother, Nina Shakhetdinova, an armenian, while he was stationed in the Caucasus. Nina died when Olga was very young. Olga's stepmother, who was also her former nurse, showed little interest in her, especially after the birth of her own daughter by Olga's father. When her father, Major General Komarov, died in 1881 Olga was placed in an orphanage for children of the nobility. She married Boris Eduardovich Forsh, who had also been born into the family of a high-ranking military officer, in 1895. In the 1890s she studied at various art schools, most importantly in Kiev and St Petersburg, where she worked in the studio of Pavel Chistyakov. In 1904 Boris Forsh resigned from the military in objection to his having to serve at the executions of political prisoners. He was deprived of his salary, and he and Olga moved to a farm in the Ukraine with their two children. Olga was also pregnant at the time. She later attributed the inspiration for her early stories to this extended period of living among the peasantry. Her first works of fiction were published in 1907. She continued drawing and painting, and worked as an art teacher at the Levitskaya School in Tsarskoye Selo in 1910-11, but she turned toward writing as time went by. Career Olga was interested in the fashionable ideas of the time, including Tolstoyanism, Theosophy and Buddhism, but was increasingly drawn to Socialism. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 Olga and her husband became active supporters of the Bolsheviks. Olga's husband died of typhus while serving with the Red Army in Kiev. After his death she continued to dedicate herself to cultural work. She devoted several novels to the history of revolutionary thought and the revolutionary movement in Russia. Among them are Palace and Prison (1924‚Äì25, also made into a film script), about the revolutionary Mikhail Stepanovich Beideman, The Fervid Workshop (1926), about the Revolution of 1905‚Äì07, and Pioneers of Freedom (1950‚Äì53), which deals with the Decembrists. She also wrote the three-part biographical novel Radishchev, which comprises the books Jacobin Leaven (1932), The Landlady of Kazan (1934‚Äì35), and The Pernicious Book (1939). Her experimental play The Substitute Lecturer was published in 1930. The fate of the creative individual under an oppressive regime is treated in the novel The Contemporaries (1926), which is about Nikolay Gogol and A. A. Ivanov. In the novels The Lunatic Ship (1931) and The Raven (originally titled The Symbolists, 1933), Olga portrayed life among the St Petersburg artistic intelligentsia in the early 20th century and the first post revolutionary years and created portraits of such contemporaries as Maxim Gorky, Alexander Blok and Fyodor Sologub. Later life Olga rose to prominence in the arena of Soviet literature, playing important roles at the 1934 Congress of Writers, and at the 1954 Congress, where she gave the opening address. She was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour (twice) and the Order of the Badge of Honour.According to Olga Forsh article at ru.wikipedia (:ru:–§–æ—Ä—à, –û–ª—å–≥–∞ –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–µ–≤–Ω–∞) She died in Tyarlova, a suburb of Leningrad, in 1961. She was buried in the Kazan Cemetery, on the outskirts of Pushkin.

Bailey Park is located in central Austin, Texas within the vicinity of the Seton Medical Center and St. Andrews Episcopal School. Located at , the small city park was created from several residential lots clustered together to make a common public green space. In 1935 F.G Rossener paid $320 in cash for lot #14 in the George W. Spears league of land. Bailey Park eventually expanded to cover or about one small city lot by the late 1930s. At one time Bailey Park was central to the neighborhood east of Shoal Creek. Although the size of Bailey Park has not changed, the relative location has. Today Bailey Park is no longer bordered by residential lots and homes, rather the park is surrounded entirely by commercial property (hospital, a multistory office building etc.) and a private school. St. Andrew's Episcopal School lies between Bailey Park and the Shoal Creek Green Belt. Bailey Park continues to see much use. Many people take advantage of what this little hidden park has to offer. Notable park features include a flagstone covered pavilion built in 1936, park swings, picnic benches, rest rooms, children's wading pool and a large field for softball. Facilities seeing the most use are outdoor tennis courts (with lights), a sand volleyball court (also with lights). A volleyball game occurs almost every evening throughout most of the year. Bailey Park also has a wide open space for flying kites, practicing soccer and other activities requiring a very large grassy area. In addition to the majestic oaks surrounding the pavilion, a wide variety of trees have been planted along the perimeter of Bailey Park.

Lindemann earned her B.A. in German language and literature in 1969 at the University of Georgia. Lindemann also earned her M.A. in theatre history and dramatic literature, in 1972, at the University of Georgia. Lindemann began her career as a copyeditor for several universities (Interview at 3AM Magazine). She then moved on to a job at the Hastings Center in New York City, an institute focused on bioethics research, and co-authored book The Patient in the Family, with James Lindemann Nelson, before deciding to earn a Ph.D. in philosophy at Fordham University in 2000. Previously, she taught at the University of Tennessee and Vassar College and served as the associate editor of the Hastings Center Report (1990‚Äì95). Lindemann currently teaches courses on feminist philosophy, identity and agency, naturalized bioethics, and narrative approaches to bioethics at Michigan State University. Contributions to philosophy Lindemann's work primarily focuses on feminist bioethics, the ethics of families, feminist ethics, and the social construction of identities. She is the former editor of Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy and was also coeditor, with Sara Ruddick and Margaret Urban Walker, of the Feminist Constructions series for Rowman & Littlefield. In addition, she coedited, with James Lindemann Nelson, a series on Reflective Bioethics for Routledge. Lindemann is a Hastings Center Fellow, a member of the advisory board for the Women‚Äôs Bioethics Project (2006‚Äì), and was the president of the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities (2008‚Äì2009). Hilde Lindemann is a narrative ethicist. A narrative approach uses stories and relationships between people in specific cases, as well as generalizable examples, for moral contexts and discussion (Gotlib). Two of her books, Holding and Letting Go: The Social Practice of Personal Identities and Alzheimer's: Answers to Hard Questions for Families, co-authored by her partner James Lindemann Nelson, have various reviews that summarize philosophical theories and ethics demonstrated in her works. The review of Holding and Letting Go: The Social Practice of Personal Identities and Alzheimer's Answer to Hard Questions for Families explains that Lindemann adopts a non-obscure, story-related approach to make readers think about realistic situations: \\"Only when we see ethical lives as diachronically and interpersonally structured and as embedded in narratively rich contexts can ethical reflection take hold in actual persons' lives\\" (Christman). The review of the co-authored book, Alzheimer's: Answers to Hard Questions for Families, also demonstrates that Lindemann employs case studies and life experiences for the patients and caregivers to convey ideas in her work (Moody). This method of provoking thought is aimed at a wide general audience of people who are not necessarily ethics scholars. Quotes on philosophy * \\"I think it‚Äôs a great mistake to see feminism as a war on men. Men aren‚Äôt responsible for the subordination of women ‚Äì they just benefit from it. It‚Äôs not politically useful to set men up as the enemy, because that alienates people whom we need as allies. And it perpetuates the victor/vanquished, master/slave relation that‚Äôs the whole problem in the first place. If the gender system is ever to be dismantled, it won‚Äôt be by declaring war on men. It‚Äôs much better to affirm lots of differences among people without insisting that differences have to be ordered into power hierarchies\\"(Interview at 3AM Magazine 2012). * \\"Narrativists have claimed, among other things, that stories of one kind or another are required: (1) to teach us our duties, (2) to guide morally good action, (3) to motivate morally good action, (4) to justify action on moral grounds, (5) to cultivate our moral sensibilities, (6) to enhance our moral perception, (7) to make actions of persons morally intelligible, and (8) to reinvent ourselves as better persons (Nelson 2001, 36).\\" (Gotlib). *\\"It might help to recall that personhood, as I have been conceptualizing it, is a social practice consisting of four necessary moments: (1) A human being feels, watches, wonders, thinks, or in some other respect engages in the mental activity that gives rise to her personality. (2) The mental activity finds bodily expression. (3) Another human being recognizes it as the expression of a personality.

The book is made up of strips dating to before Spiegelman started planning his graphic novel Maus, but includes the strip \\"Maus\\" which presaged the graphic novel, and \\"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\\" which is reproduced in Maus. The original edition of 1977 is subtitled From Maus to Now; the expanded 2008 edition is subtitled Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@&*!. Overview The original 1977 edition was made up of short, experimental strips, some of which were autobiographical, made between 1972 and 1977. At that stage in his career, Spiegelman was more interested in the formal elements of the comics medium than in its content or storytelling aspects. He experimented with and explored the relation of panels to each other on the page, pictorial manipulation, and how far one could take a story formally before it became incoherent. He parodied and paid homage to his cartoon heroes, notably Chester Gould's Dick Tracy, Rex Morgan, M.D., and Winsor McCay's Dream of the Rarebit Fiend. The cover depicts Spiegelman drinking a bottle of India ink over repeated variants of the same image. The title is written in shaky block letters, implying both visual and psychological breakdowns. =Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@&*! (2008)= The expanded 2008 edition made use of a swirl or squiggle motif. The seemingly tossed-off squiggle is used in a variety of contexts. It is first introduced as the expression of surprise of the character on the cover slipping on a copy of the first edition of Breakdowns (rather than a clich√©d banana peel). At other times it is used to represent the artist himself, or the squiggles he makes as a youth learning to draw. Spiegelman depicts himself in the vest that has become synonymous with his image since Maus, in contrast to his appearance in the comics from the original Breakdowns. Publication history Breakdowns was originally published in an edition that sold less than 3000 copies in 1977 by Belier Press as Breakdowns: From Maus to Now, collecting strips that had appeared between 1972 and 1977 in various underground publications, including Arcade, which Spiegelman had co-edited. Unusually for American comics at the time, it was published in hardcover. It was republished in an expanded edition by Pantheon Books in 2008 and retitled Breakdowns: Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@&*!, with a new introductory comic and long afterword which nearly double the length of the original book. When Spiegelman had been working on In the Shadow of No Towers, a book with many of the formal concerns of Breakdowns, his editor at Pantheon Books, Dan Frank, approached him to reprint Breakdowns. Style and analysis Spiegelman visually relates the story of a boy who bullied him and spat on his mother in his youth, echoing with irony the well-known Charles Atlas advertisements such as \\"The Insult that Made a Man out of Mac\\" that ran in comic books.

She is introduced as the granddaughter of Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) and Julie Perkins (Cathy Murphy), and an extension to the already established Mitchell family. Lola made her first appearance on 12 July 2011. Her storylines have mainly focused on her relationship with her family, a teenage pregnancy after a one-night stand with her cousin Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden), fighting to keep newborn daughter Lexi out of care, her friendships with Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) and Dexter Hartman (Khali Best) and a relationship with Peter Beale (Ben Hardy/Dayle Hudson) despite their families' disagreements. Some critics gave a positive response to Lola's introduction. Kate Woodward of Inside Soap said Lola's introduction had been a \\"revelation\\" and Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror stated \\"in little less than a month on the Square, the spirited Lola has already created havoc.\\" On 23 July 2012, Lola gave birth to her daughter, Lexi Pearce, during a seven-minute live segment, making her the first character to ever give birth live on EastEnders and the second character ever in soap opera. On 13 June 2015, it was announced that Harold was exiting her role as Lola after being written out of the show. Harold left the show on 28 July 2015. Bosses left the door open for her to return, and a return for the character was announced on 20 December 2018. Lola returned on 1 April 2019. Storylines =2011‚Äì2015= When Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) and Julie Perkins (Cathy Murphy) decide to find the son that Julie put up for adoption as a baby, Dan Pearce, they discover he has died. However, they find that they have a granddaughter, Lola, who is in care. They visit Lola at the care home and witness a fight between Lola and another girl, believing Lola is the injured girl, but Lola turns out to be the perpetrator. She tells Billy and Julie that Dan hated them so Julie decides to leave. Billy hugs Lola before they go and Lola uses this as an excuse to steal his wallet. The next day, she comes to Walford and returns Billy's wallet. She flirts with several locals, including Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) and Fatboy (Ricky Norwood). Fatboy allows her to clean cars for him but she takes one and crashes into it into Ian Beale's (Adam Woodyatt) chip shop. Billy sees this and tells her to run and Fatboy takes the blame. Lola visits Billy again and meets other members of his family. Julie tells Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison) that she does not want Lola to live with them and Heather accidentally tells Lola. Julie feels that Lola is not their problem and Lola tells Julie that if Billy is forced to choose between them, she will win. Julie calls the police and has Lola returned to her care home, while Billy calls her \\"100% Mitchell\\". A week later, Julie finds Lola in the R&R; nightclub and takes her home, after Julie apologies for reporting Lola to the police, and tries to get to know Lola properly. Lola overhears Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskas) and his brother Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline) insulting Billy, and in revenge, burns their father Eddie's (David Essex) stock. She gets a job at the caf√© and admits to Liam Butcher (James Forde) that she started the fire. Lola starts stealing from the till at the caf√© and short-changing the customers so Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) sacks her. She asks Phil for her job back and offers her mobile phone in payment for the money she took but he takes the phone and refuses to give Lola her job back. She takes revenge by smashing up his garage and destroying a car, unaware that Jay is under the car, and is badly injured. She gets Julie and when the ambulance arrives, Julie takes the blame. She is released without charge, while Lola returns to the care home but is persuaded to come back and Julie leaves Walford. Weeks later, Ian oversleeps and Lola tells him that she has been waiting outside the chip shop. Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) tells Ian to fire her, which he does but Lola soon persuades Ian to give her job back, by promising not to tell anyone about Mandy staying. She takes a liking to Jay's friend, Duncan Willis (Steven France) but later vandalises Grace Olubunmi's (Ellen Thomas) flowers. She decides to take up self-defence classes after Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) is mugged. Lola steals towels from the Booty beauty salon and tries to sell them but is caught by Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), who threatens to call the police. However, Lola convinces Roxy that she has shown ingenuity, and gains a job at the salon. Lola asks her third cousin-once-removed, Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe) how he knows he is gay if he is still a virgin. Subsequently, they kiss and Lola sleeps with Ben before confirming his sexuality; he is gay. Shortly after, Lola finds she is pregnant and tells Billy, who is angry. Lola refuses to name the father but tells Billy that she plans to keep the baby and wants him to bring it up with her. She later tells Ben that he is not the father. Billy takes Lola to see Pat Evans (Pam St Clement) about help, but Pat misunderstands and advises Lola to have an abortion, angering her. In December, Phil confronts Lola about a mystery file, thinking that she's been stalking him. Phil questions Lola, to the point where she steps backwards and falls down the steps to her basement flat. She is rushed to hospital and soon learns that she and the baby are fine. Lola receives a call to say Social Services want to visit, as there is a new social worker. Lola goes missing when the social worker, Harpreet (Danny Rahim) arrives, so Billy asks Abi to pretend to be Lola. Billy assumes Harpreet is there about the pregnancy, so tells Harpreet, who is impressed with Abi's speech about motherhood. However, Lola arrives as he is about to leave and tells him that she is Lola, so Harpreet says the trust has been lost and she may not be able to keep the child. After falling down the stairs, she realizes how much the baby means to her and later finds out the baby is a girl. Lola begins working for Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) as a cleaner and continues working at the chip shop, until Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), sacks her. Lola takes revenge on Lucy by stealing chip fat from the shop and pouring it over cars at the car lot, making Lucy a suspect. When Lucy learns Lola is responsible, she calls the police and Lola is arrested. The next day, on her 16th birthday, she receives community service and a curfew, and has to wear an electronic ankle tag. Lola and Jay break into The Queen Victoria public house and get locked in after hiding in the back room. There, Lola opens up to Jay saying she will be a bad mother. Lola gets home just in time for her curfew, then runs back out and shares an illicit kiss with Jay, who is actually still dating Abi. She angers Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), after vandalising her stock at the charity shop and later prepares for Billy carrying the Olympic Torch but realises she is in labour in McClunkeys, where Cora delivers Lola's baby daughter whom she names Lexi Billie Pearce, after her friend, Alexa Smith (Saffron Coomber). Billy witnesses the birth after successfully carrying the torch. When it is revealed, that Jay helped to cover up Heather's murder, Lola is at first wary of him, although she eventually forgives him. However, Billy is unhappy about them spending time together especially when Jay is forced to hide when a social worker turns up. Lola appears heartbroken when Jay says they should stop seeing each other. When Lola gets a new social worker, Trish Barnes (Tessa Churchard), she becomes increasingly agitated after Trish criticises her care of Lexi. She later bumps into Alexa and pretends to live a party lifestyle. Alexa and her gang spend time with Lola but when Alexa picks on Abi, Lola defends her and rejects her old friend. Lola later reveals she has a baby, named Lexi after Alexa, shocking her. Lola celebrates her tag being removed but is threatened by Alexa and her gang, who attack Abi and threaten Lexi, resulting in Lola punching Alexa. The police are informed and Lola is arrested while Trish takes Lexi into care. Lola begs Trish not to and asks Phil for help, telling him that he is Lexi's grandfather. Lexi is taken regardless and Trish tells her that Lexi could be away for up to eight weeks. Lola gets angry so Trish tells her she could lose Lexi for good if she does not control her temper. Phil tells Lola that he will get her back where she belongs. Lola is happy until she discovers that Phil wants custody but she eventually agrees to Phil's plan. Phil comes up with a plan for Lola to marry Ben and conspires with Billy, who is against the idea. Lola refuses to marry Ben and Phil plans to tell Ben the truth about Lexi, against Lola's wishes. Phil does not tell Ben but agrees to help Lola so asks Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) to pretend to be his partner to help get Lexi. She refuses initially but agrees until she finds out that Lola does not know about the plan, angering Lola until Phil explains his reasons to her. Alexa drops the assault charge but Lola is devastated to learn that she will not get Lexi back. Lola worries that Phil's plan will fail after he tells Social Services that he and Sharon are no longer engaged, but Phil does become Lexi's kinship foster carer. Lola is devastated to learn that she will still only have three access visits a week, and Phil starts being controlling, calling Lexi \\"his\\" baby and not allowing Lola to provide for her. Phil also tells Lola who she can be friends with, disapproving of her friendship with Dexter Hartman (Khali Best). Phil decides to take Lexi on holiday so Lola seeks legal advice but agrees that Lexi can go. Lola makes a request in court to increase her access visits with Lexi, and Trish states that Lola has made good progress but Phil's lawyer tells the court that Lola is often late, brings age-inappropriate toys and is unable to handle Lexi's tears. The judge rules that Lexi will stay with Phil as kinship foster carer. Billy goes to speak to Phil, while Lola listens and hears Phil say that he will never give Lexi back voluntarily so Lola snatches Lexi and leaves. Phil, Billy and Sharon spend the rest of the day looking for her, eventually finding her at a playground. Lola goes home and Phil asks her to meet him later at his house. Trish is there and asks them if their relationship has broken down but Phil tells her that he is responsible for recent events and agrees to work with Lola to make the transition for Lexi to return to living with Lola as easy as possible. When Trish leaves, Phil allows Lola to look after Lexi, and starts giving her increased access. Phil is impressed when Lola acts calmly when Lexi is taken ill with suspected meningitis, though she is fine. Lola notices that Sharon is acting strangely and finds her passed out when she should be with Lexi. When Sharon regains consciousness, she admits that she is addicted to painkillers and tells Lola that if she tells Phil, Lexi will go back into care. Phil also later catches Sharon unconscious and when she comes round, he confronts her and throws her out. Just before the final hearing to decide if Lexi should be returned to Lola, Phil learns that Lola knew about Sharon's drug addiction and calls her a bad mother before leaving the court building. However, Billy convinces him to do the right thing, and Lola is successful in getting Lexi back. Lola develops feelings for Peter Beale (Ben Hardy), but the feud between his family, the Beales, and her family, the Mitchells, make them anxious about being together. However, they eventually force Phil and Peter's father Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) to accept their relationship. Peter moves in with Lola, Lexi and Billy and pressures her to start a career in childcare when she loses her job at the local salon. Despite agreeing to do the course, Lola starts her own business doing the locals manicures and pedicures and loves it. She becomes closer to Jay and admits how Peter makes her feel that she is not good enough for him. After an argument with Peter, Lola turns to Jay for support and he tries to kiss her. Horrified, she goes to run off but as she steps out into the road she is accidentally run over by Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack). She is immediately rushed to hospital, where she is told she has concussion, but is discharged the following day. Following the murder of Peter's twin sister Lucy (see Who Killed Lucy Beale?), Lola struggles to support him as he in turn is struggling to support Ian and the rest of his family. When Lucy's memory is tarnished in a Walford Gazette article, Lola approaches them and gives them an article of content of what she believes will paint Lucy in a much better light. However, her words are twisted and Peter believes that Lola did it just for the money. Peter ends his relationship with her, and moves home to Ian. After Lucy's funeral Peter moves back home with Lola and Lexi. Peter begins developing feelings for his ex-girlfriend, Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), despite her relationship with Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo). Peter ends his relationship with Lola after admitting he kissed Lauren. Although Lola wants to make the relationship work, Peter still declines and begins a relationship with Lauren after she dumps Dean. In September 2014, Ben (now played by Harry Reid) returns to the square for Phil's wedding to Sharon. Billy and Jay hide Lola after Phil wants Ben to meet Lexi and tell Phil that she is visiting an ill friend. A few weeks later, Lola returns to see Phil, however comes face to face with Ben. While Lola is in the pub with Jay, Ben and Abi walk in and Lola is confused as to why Abi is being so cold. Ben walks over to Lola insisting she is a good mother and he doesn't want to take Lexi away. When helping Johnny Carter (Sam Strike) at The Albert, Lola insists she has nothing to do with Abi and Jay's break up and begins making friends with her. Abi then tells her that she is in a relationship with Ben, causing Lola to be confused and worried, so Abi becomes defensive and think Lola is stealing Ben away. Jay invites Lola to The Queen Vic where Abi tells Lola that Jay only invited her to get back at her. After Jay reveals that Ben tried to kiss him, Lola walks out of The Queen Vic and Ben denies his accusations. Lola questions if Jay was using her to try to make Abi jealous, but Jay reveals to Lola that he still has feelings for her. When Jay tries to kiss Lola, she rejects him, telling him that she does not feel the same way about him. Lola is excited when her boss Dean asks her out to discuss her future at Blades hair salon and dresses nicely, but Dean's concerned mother, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), sends her away, worrying about Dean's reputation. Lola is frustrated when newcomer Paul Coker (Jonny Labey) accidentally knocks her over in the street, but they become colleagues. Dean sacks Lola for being absent but Phil gives Shirley a large amount of money to secure Lola's job. Following Ben's arrest on suspicion of murdering Lucy, Jay is worried he will be arrested as well after he reveals that Ben mugged Lucy on the night of her death. Lola comforts and reassures him and then they kiss, leading to sex. They then start a relationship. Jay tells Lola he wants to leave because Phil has given the police Lucy's incriminating purse and phone with fingerprints on it. She is upset but Jay suggests she goes with him, which she does, taking Lexi with them. Jay calls Billy and reveals that he, Lola and Lexi are moving to Newcastle with Dexter. She returns briefly with Jay to collect more belongings, but Billy tries to convince her to stay and let Jay go to Newcastle alone, but Lola refuses. Billy tells Lola he is going to collect his daughter Janet Mitchell (Grace) so that they can all share their goodbyes, but Billy reports Jay to the police and he is arrested for robbery. Lola realises that Billy reported Jay moments after Jay's arrest, so Lola leaves for the train station with Lexi. Billy attempts to convince Lola to stay in Walford, but she says she could have a better life somewhere else and that she wants him to be proud of her. Billy and Lola share an emotional farewell and Lola leaves for Newcastle, taking Lexi with her. Although Jay plans to join her eventually, Lola later ends the relationship because she is now dating Dexter. =2019‚Äì= Lola returns along with Lexi and Ben. When the Mitchells have a celebratory drink in The Queen Vic, Jay and Lola have conversation in which Lola reveals she and Dexter are no longer together and agreed to a mutual break-up. It is revealed that Lola and Ben are only back to con Phil and Ben promises to give both Lola and Lexi some of the money. Lola reunites with Jay and they almost start dating again however, it is revealed that Lola is engaged to Ewan (Riley Jones). Jay rejects Lola and she decides to move back to Newcastle with Ewan but Ben manipulates the situation and Ewan leaves Walford. Lola tries to get Billy back with Honey Mitchell (Emma Barton) and schemes various times to break up Honey and her boyfriend Adam Bateman (Stephen Rahman-Hughes), although she is unsuccessful. She starts working as an Events Manager with Jay's girlfriend Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton) and the two eventually bump heads with each other. Lola becomes aware of Ben's schemes and warns him to end them, otherwise she will leave with Lexi. After Ben's plans to swindle Phil are exposed, Lola decides to remain in Walford and starts working as a hairdresser for Denise Fox (Diane Parish). During The Queen Vic siege where Hunter Owen (Charlie Winter) takes the residents hostage, Lola and Jay are locked in the bathroom together where they admit their feelings. They kiss and resume their relationship. Lola is shocked when she finds out that she is pregnant with Jay's baby. Jay is stunned when she insists for an abortion; proclaiming that it is too soon for them to have a child after Lexi. Their relationship hits the rocks when Jay proposes to Lola and she assumes he is only doing this to get her to keep the baby, and after a bitter row, she secretly ends up in a drunken embrace with Peter (now played by Dayle Hudson), recently returned from New Zealand. She goes to her abortion appointment alone the next day and is surprised afterwards by Jay, who tells her that he does not care about the abortion and only wants her to be happy. They reconcile but Jay is unaware that she had sex with Peter. Creation and development =Casting= Lola was introduced as the granddaughter of Billy Mitchell (played by Perry Fenwick, pictured). The character of Lola was announced on 7 June 2011 and she was created as an extension of the established Mitchell family. As she meets her grandparents for the first time, Lola quickly forms a bond with them as she has been deserted by everyone else in her life. Eighteen-year-old Harold was cast in the role and she said \\"I am so excited to be joining EastEnders. I have watched the show all my life and I never thought that one day I could be in Albert Square. It feels strange to be walking round Walford with people I have grown up watching‚ÄîI still have to pinch myself.\\". EastEnders is Harold's first acting job and she was given the role following her first audition, which shocked her. Harold told Daybreak, \\"It was my first audition that I'd ever had, so I was really nervous and I was thinking, 'I'm never going to get it - I'm just going to have fun while I'm there'. I was just shocked to even get the casting for it, so I was over the moon when I actually got the part.\\" Harold previously starred in Jamie Oliver's Channel 4 reality show Jamie's Dream School and got into an acting school because of the show. Harold said she had always wanted to be an actress and was grateful to be given a great character in Lola. Lola made her first appearance on 12 July 2011. =Characterisation and style= In an interview with Inside Soap, Harold said she was grateful for the complex nature of her character, saying, \\"Lola's not out-and-out evil but she's not very nice. She's got so many sides and I am having a great time exploring them.\\" Lola is described as \\"a stroppy little 15-year-old, prone to fighting, tea-leafing and gobbing off.\\" She is also \\"sharp, cocky but likeable.\\" Of Lola's personality, the official EastEnders website said \\"Bright as a button but with a mouth that runs away with her, Lola is wild and definitely Walford bound. A self-reliant person who does what she has to do in order to get what she wants, she's not to be messed with.\\" Harold described her character as \\"feisty\\" and said she has got a lot of attitude. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy, labelled Lola \\"rebellious\\", while the BBC said she is \\"a troublesome teen\\" and a \\"petite bombshell.\\" BT described the character as \\"EastEnders' new tearaway and Billy's wayward granddaughter\\" and said \\"It seems Lola isn't exactly the butter-wouldn't-melt type. Surprise, surprise. Billy and Julie leave when Lola tells Billy she's not interested in the fact that he's her granddad, or that her dad's dead. What a lovely young lady.\\" Virgin Media also branded Lola a troublemaking, teen tearaway and said she was \\"a chip off the Mitchell block.\\" They added that she is a \\"blonde babe.\\" Chris Hooton from the Metro branded Lola as \\"mischievous.\\" Lola usually wears a tracksuit and trainers. =Storyline development= When Lola arrives she becomes embroiled in a love triangle with Jay Mitchell and Abi Branning. The storyline was summed up in Inside Soap by Kate Woodward who commented \\"Although I love Abi and Jay together, it's great to see them face serious obstacles thanks to her meddling. Lola is big trouble and has Jay is firmly in her sights. But he's in love with Abi. It was a brilliant idea to team moody Jay with good girl Abi. They work well as a couple, but with the interference of Lola their story has got even more interesting.\\" When Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) begins to be stalked, the BBC named Lola one of the many suspects. However, the stalker is later revealed to be Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe). Pregnancy, live birth and motherhood On 15 July 2012, it was revealed that Harold would become only the second actress to act out a birth during a live episode of a soap opera, following Coronation Street's Jennie McAlpine (Fiz Brown) in the live 50th anniversary episode broadcast in December 2010. An insider from the Daily Mirror stated \\"No-one has tried anything like this on EastEnders live before so it is a real challenge to get the emotion of the situation right. It will be the toughest thing Danielle has done in her acting career.\\"EastEnders star Danielle Harold will play scenes where Lola Pearce gives birth live - Mirror Online The episode broadcast on 23 July 2012 and centred around Lola's grandfather Billy carrying the Olympic Torch across Walford. A seven-minute live segment at the end of episode showed Lola giving birth to her daughter, while Billy rushed to witness the birth.'EastEnders' Lola to give birth in live Olympics episode - EastEnders News - Soaps - Digital Spy Harold said of the rehearsals for the live section: \\"I have known about this live episode for such a long time but all of a sudden it has crept up on us. I am really nervous but now we have started rehearsing, I am feeling equally excited. It will definitely be an experience and I hope Perry runs smoothly!\\" She also said she was \\"terrified\\" of acting out the birth, saying she would prefer to give birth in real life. She said that filming the pre-recorded labour scenes meant she \\"was knackered after screaming and crying and pretending to push all day.\\" In an interview with Digital Spy, she said that she was \\"really, really nervous\\" and that the prospect of acting the birth was \\"very scary\\", but added, \\"I really appreciate that they've given me the opportunity, especially considering that I haven't been here at EastEnders for that long. It's really nice that they've trusted me with it, so hopefully I'll do it justice! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it'll go well.\\" To help prepare, she asked several women for advice, including her mother, and was told \\"It's the worst pain you can ever imagine!\\" She found it \\"quite difficult\\" to imagine what it would be live to act out as she has no children, but had watched Channel 4 show One Born Every Minute to help, as she did not want to \\"overdo the scene or make it look really fake.\\" In October 2012, Lola's daughter Lexi is taken into care. =Departure (2015)= On 13 June 2015, entertainment website Digital Spy revealed that EastEnders had chosen to write the character out of the show. They announced that Harold would be filming her final scenes within the following months and that show bosses are not killing Lola off, leaving potential for a return in the future. Harold praised her time on the show and the storylines she has been given: \\"I've had the most amazing time at EastEnders having been involved in some exciting storylines, including giving birth in a live scene.\\" She also said how she would miss the cast and crew at EastEnders and how she looks forward to her acting future. Executive producer, Dominic Treadwell-Collins spoke of Danielle and her time on the square: \\"We all love Danielle and she and Lola have been a big part of EastEnders over the past four years. Danielle is a fantastic actress and I genuinely look forward to seeing her shine in future roles away from the Square.\\" Lola's exit scenes aired on 28 July 2015. = Reintroduction (2019)= In May 2018, Harold expressed an interest in reprising her role as Lola, opining that Billy needed her character's support. She added that she would return if she was asked. Seven months later, on 20 December 2018, it was announced that Lola would return to EastEnders over three years since her exit. Upon her reintroduction, the character is billed as matured and \\"a fiercely protective mum\\" to Lexi. Harold expressed her delight at reprising her role, commenting, \\"I can't wait to get back and find out what Lola has been up to.\\" Kate Oates, the senior executive producer of EastEnders, said that she \\"admired Lola's fiesty, fiery spirit\\" and looked forward to her return. She added that it would create storylines for the characters related to Lola, including Jay and Billy. Reception Harold's debut episode was watched by 7.68m viewers. Harold said that because of her performance as Lola she had received letters from children who had grown up in care homes, saying how much they love her character. Kate Woodward of Inside Soap said Lola's introduction had been a revelation. Woodward also commented on Harold's performance saying \\"In actress Danielle Harold, EastEnders have found a young star with enormous charisma, so you like Lola even though she's a nightmare! In the coming weeks, we'll see her really hold her own with the other Mitchells ‚Äì which is no mean feat when you consider that most of them have been in this show for years.\\" Woodward's colleague, Sarah, said she liked what she saw, after Lola's debut and described the character saying \\"She's got a surly attitude, and acts like she's tough as old boots. But something tells me that underneath that hard exterior is a lost little girl just waiting for someone to finally take her into the heart of their family.\\" Tony Stewart writing for the Daily Mirror described Lola as \\"a walking 15-year-old Asbo\\", he added \\"in little less than a month on the Square, the spirited Lola has already created havoc. [...] With Danielle Harold already tipped as a best newcomer in the next round of soap awards, stroppy Lola is either brave or stupid in taking on Phil.\\" Metro's Christopher Hooton commented negatively on Harold's performance as Lola saying \\"Lola kept her world record attempt for worst acting in a soap going strong\\". Hooton's fellow writer, Rachel Tarley, said Harold's acting skills were \\"terrible\\" when Julie departed. During the love triangle storyline, Tarley said Lola was an \\"inept teenage seductresses.\\" Co-star Perry Fenwick said that Harold is an \\"amazing\\" actress. A writer for Bang Showbiz branded Lola a \\"blonde babe\\". =Response to social worker storyline= The scenes where Trish Barnes takes Lexi from Lola were criticised by the charity The Who Cares? Trust on Twitter, who called the storyline an \\"unhelpful portrayal\\" and said it had already received calls from members of the public who were \\"distressed about the EastEnders scene where a social worker snatches a baby from its mother's arms\\". The scenes were also condemned by the British Association of Social Workers (BASW), calling the BBC \\"too lazy and arrogant\\" to get correctly portray the child protection process, and saying that the baby was taken \\"without sufficient grounds to do so\\". Bridget Robb, acting chief of the BASW, said the storyline provoked \\"real anger among a profession well used to a less than accurate public and media perception of their jobs\\". She stated: Another social worker said \\"Accurate procedures were not followed [when a character's baby was taken away]. Was it police protection, section 20? Where was the immediate risk to the baby? As a social worker, I was in tears, as was a colleague of mine, watching how our profession was portrayed on television.\\" The BBC responded to BASW by saying: A social worker who received the BBC's statement commented: In November 2012, Irish politician Robert Troy expressed concerns that the storyline could influence the result of an upcoming referendum on children's rights. Troy said, \\"Quite a few times I have been asked about a storyline on EastEnders where a young mother has had her child taken into care and has faced a very difficult battle to get access to the child. People have been emotionally affected by the story and have a real concern about the sort of heavy-handed state intervention that's portrayed.\\" Kate White from Inside Soap praised the storyline, saying, \\"Here you are teasing us all with endless mystery secrets and secret mysteries, yet the best storyline you have is hiding nothing at all! The simple tail of a young mum's love for her baby is heart-breaking and dramatic. All credit to actress Danielle Harold for being so brilliant as Lola. [...] Keep on keeping it simple.\\" See also *List of EastEnders characters (2011) References External links * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2011 Category:Fictional beauticians Category:Fictional hairdressers Category:Teenage characters in television Category:Fictional characters involved in incest Category:Fictional teenage parents Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas ","title":"Lola Pearce"},{"id":"32004155","text":"The Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART¬Æ II) tsunami buoy.

Jeremy James and Bill Hartston presenting an episode of The Master Game, 1981 Presented by Jeremy James with expert analysis from Leonard Barden and, later, Bill Hartston, The Master Game was noted for its innovative style, in which a display board with animated figurines and move notation, shown centre-left of screen, was accompanied by footage of the players cogitating, their thoughts during the game heard in voice-over. As a theme tune, the later series of this programme used the Disco '78 version of Ennio Morricone's \\"Come Maddalena\\". History and technique The Master Games producer, Robert Toner, recalled previous work for the coverage of the Fischer-Spassky 1972 World Championship match: \\"Marsland Gander, then TV critic of the Daily Telegraph, wrote, 'The manner in which the games are presented, with experts standing in front of magnetic boards, moving pieces by hand, shows that television has made no technical progress with chess for the past twenty years'. He was right ‚Äì from that time I began to wrestle with the problem.\\" The result was the creation of a special invitational knock-out tournament. The games were played away from the television studio, the audio recordings of the players' thoughts being made immediately afterwards. The players would later be filmed in a studio reconstruction of the game, made to match the audio recordings. Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen considers his move during Tony Miles vs. Bent Larsen, The Master Game, 1981 Added to this intensive, unorthodox production method were the ground-breaking animated board and pieces created by designer John Bone and the technicians at BBC Bristol. This effect was achieved using a glass chess table on which the moves were made by a cloaked and gloved player. The piece symbols seen on-screen were actually on the underside of the pieces themselves, which were filmed from beneath in reflection, to correct for the left/right reversal that resulted. In addition to this, the expert commentator could use an electronic pointer, illuminating the squares to graphically indicate the ideas being discussed. The effect that combining all of these elements produced had never been previously achieved and is remarkably similar to a high quality, digitally produced, modern multimedia chess presentation, yet was created using only puppetry techniques, fairy lights, mirrors and much editing.

It has been restored and furnished by the National Trust for Scotland, and is operated as a popular tourist attraction, with over 40,000 visitors annually.The Georgian House, National Trust of Scotland. Retrieved July 2011  The New Town and Charlotte Square  In 1766 a young unknown architect named James Craig won the competition to design a layout for Edinburgh's first New Town. By this time in the mid-18th century Edinburgh had become extremely overcrowded and the rich and poor alike were living in very close quarters in cramped conditions in the tenements of the medieval Old Town. The New Town was to be constructed to the north of the Old Town, and the intention was that it would remain a strictly residential development, a privileged enclave for the wealthy away from the squalor found in the Old Town. Today visitors can experience what life was like in the Old Town by visiting Gladstone's Land on the Royal Mile, which is a restored tenement building set up as the dwelling of a 17th-century merchant. Plan for the New Town by James Craig (1768) Craig's design for the New Town formed a grid-like pattern consisting three principal streets and two large squares with gardens for the residents use. The main thoroughfare was George Street (named after King George III), right at the centre of the development running east to west; this was the only main street to have houses constructed on both sides. Princes Street (named in honour of the King's sons) which ran parallel to George Street was designed as a terrace (meaning that it had houses on only one side) overlooking what was to become Prince's Street Gardens and facing the Old Town lay to the south of the grid. Queen Street (named for Queen Charlotte, who was the wife of George III) ran parallel to George Street on the north side of the New Town. It also had houses on one side only and again gardens were laid out for the use of the residents of the street (these gardens are still private today). At either end of George Street were the squares. At the east end of the New Town was St Andrew Square and at the west end was Charlotte Square. The original intention was to name this western square as St George's Square in order that both patron saints of Scotland and England were represented. However, another square on the south side of the Old Town had already been built and named George Square, so to avoid any confusion between the two the New Town square was renamed in honour of the Queen. Craig's grid design was enhanced by other streets and lanes in between the main three, including Rose Street and Thistle Street. This patriotic street naming was a deliberate attempt to show that Scotland was now fully on board with the Union with England after the final defeat of the Jacobites at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. Three further streets which ran on a north to south axis completed Craig's grid: these were Hannover Street (named after the royal dynasty), Frederick Street (named after the father of George III) and Castle Street, for the views of Edinburgh Castle which the streets position affords. The New Town was built from St Andrew's Square in the east and continued west. Critics of the development began to complain that the streets were too plain and regimented and that there was a general lack of architectural merit. In response to this, Scotland's foremost architect of the day Robert Adam was asked to draw up elevations for Charlotte Square so that the New Town could be finished off with a flourish of grandeur and elegance. Adam drew up the plans in 1791, but he did not live to see the completion of the square, since he died in 1792 just as building work was commencing. The first houses were completed on the north elevation of the square and were ready for occupation by the mid-1790s. No. 7, today's Georgian House, was completed in 1796 and was purchased for ¬£1,800 by John Lamont to serve as his townhouse to be used during the social season. The north side of Robert Adam's Charlotte Square. No. 6 or Bute House, official residence of the First Minister of Scotland, is in the centre and the Georgian House No. 7 is next door on the left of the picture.  Occupants of No. 7 Charlotte Square  1796-1815 John Lamont of Lamont was born in c. 1741 and was the eldest of seven children. He became the 18th Chief of the Clan Lamont in 1767 and inherited the Ardlamont Estate in Argyllshire. As a member of the landed gentry he was not in paid employment and his main income came from the rents collected from his tenants. In 1773, he married Helen Campbell and the couple had five children together: John, Amelia, Norman, Georgina and Helen Elizabeth. Although John Lamont was a comparatively wealthy person he had inherited some debts and owing to his own extravagant lifestyle his financial difficulties began to mount up. He spent much of his time in London where he attempted to involve himself in politics and lived beyond his means. His portrait was painted by one of Scotland's most sought after artists of the day, Henry Raeburn. He died at his Ardlamont country seat in 1816, heavily in debt. The previous year he had sold No. 7 Charlotte Square for ¬£3,000 and had abandoned his urban pursuits. It is this first owner who is of most interest to the visitors of the Georgian House today, due to the fact that it has been restored to represent what the house may have looked like at the time it was occupied by the Lamont family around the turn of the 19th century. 1815-1845 The second owner of the property was Mrs Catherine Farquharson of Invercauld. She was a widow with three children. Catherine was the only survivor of 11 children and she therefore inherited her father's estate, which in normal circumstances would have gone to the male heir, so she was a woman of independent wealth. The 1841 shows that she was living in the house with one relative and eight servants. The house was sold in 1845. 1845-1889 Charles Neaves, Lord Neaves bought the house in 1845. He had a very distinguished career as a criminal lawyer. In 1852 he was made Solicitor-General, before succeeding Lord Cockburn to the bench in 1853. Five years later he was appointed a Lord of Judiciary. In 1851 the census shows that he and his wife had eight children, and employed six servants. By 1861, there were 10 children and 10 servants which included a butler and a pageboy. In 1881 Mrs Neaves is a widow and her three unmarried daughters live with her, along with seven servants. 1889-1927 In 1889 Rev Alexander Whyte moved into No. 7 with his wife. It was to be his home for the next 27 years. He was minister of St. George's Free Church. The couple had altogether eight children. Robert aged 24 was killed in action in the First World War, Alexander Frederick, born in 1883 was an MP, was knighted and became the President of the Indian Legislative Assembly. Dr Whyte was born in 1836 in Kirriemuir and he served his apprenticeship to a shoemaker before becoming a school teacher. He saved up enough money to go to Aberdeen University and then to New College, Edinburgh to study theology. In 1880 he became minister of Free St George's and in 1880 he married Jane Barbour of Bonskeid. Nine years later they moved into No. 7 Charlotte Square from 52 Melville Street. He died in 1921, and Mrs Whyte remained in the house as a widow until 1927. It was during the occupancy of the Whyte's that in 1913, \`Abdu'l-Bah√° the son of the founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith came to stay at No. 7 Charlotte Square during his tour of the United kingdom. 1927-1966 The Bute Family were the fifth owners of No. 7 Charlotte Square. It was the 4th Marquess of Bute (1881‚Äì1947) who in 1927 purchased the house and added it to his earlier acquisitions of Nos. 5 and 6, so now he owned the middle section of Robert Adam's 'palace front' design. He used his influence to get the other owners of properties on the North side of the square to restore the facade to be more in line with Adam's original design. He removed many Victorian alterations such as dormer windows in the attics, lower drawing room windows and altered front doors. The Marquis did not live in No. 7 and instead let it out to be used as the showrooms and workshops of Whytock and Reid, the antique dealers and cabinet makers. On the death in 1956 of the 5th marquess of Bute, Nos 5, 6 and 7 passed through the Land Fund procedures to the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) in part satisfaction of death duties. After the lease to Whytock and Reid expired in 1973 The NTS decided to restore the basement, ground and first floors of the property as a Georgian Show House, not a museum, but as close as possible to a living house, so that it gives the feeling of a family home.  No. 7 Charlotte Square Today, The Georgian House  The Georgian House is one of the most visited sites in the NTS, and plays host to in excess of 40,000 visitors each year, from local schoolchildren to sightseers from all over the world. Over 200 local people volunteer at the Georgian House, the vast majority of them as 'room guides', who are there to answer any questions that visitors may have as they walk round the house. Most of the furnishings and fittings in the house date from at the later Georgian period (c1760-1830), but some objects are older still. When visitors arrive at the property they are greeted at the reception in the Hallway, here the admission tickets are issued and a member of staff or volunteer gives an introduction to the house and points them in the direction they should go to begin the tour of the property. There is no guided tour, visitors are free to walk around the house at their own pace, and in each of the main restored rooms there is a volunteer guide on hand to answer visitors questions. The Basement The Kitchen is found at the rear of the basement and has an adjoining scullery, it is well equipped with items which all date back to the Georgian period and have been acquired for the trust over the years. There is also a Servants Room and wine cellar. On this floor there is also a gift shop, the house wine cellar and a china closet. The Ground Floor The dining room There are two rooms to be seen on the ground floor. The dining room is at the front of the house, the table is set as it would have been for dinner around 1810. The walls are adorned with many portraits, in the 18th and 19th century this was done so that you could show off about your ancestors as you entertained friends to dinner. There is a narrow passage between the dining room and the bedroom which contains a c. 1805 flushing toilet. The master bedroom overlooks the rear of the house and sits directly above the kitchen. The bed is the dominant feature in the room, it dates from 1774 and was made for Newliston House on the outskirts of Edinburgh. The First Floor There are a further two rooms on this floor - the Drawing Room, and the Parlour. The Drawing Room is at the front of the house overlooking Charlotte Square garden. It is the full width of the house, and it is where the family would have entertained on a more lavish scale. There are many fine paintings on the walls, some by well-known artists, a neo-classical revival marble fireplace and an 1802 square piano of which a recording of it being played can be heard in the background in this room. As of 2011 this room features a fitted carpet which represents the fact that these were commonly found in drawing rooms in the 18th century. The new carpet was made to an original design from 1797. The Parlour is the room where the family would have gathered on a daily basis, as they would have only opened up the drawing room when entertaining on a larger scale. This is the room where tea would have been served and therefore there are tea caddies on the table, there are also two tea tables and there are Minton and Spode tea services in the bureau. The walls are painted the same colour as in the drawing room to reflect the fact that on an evening when there was large entertainments both rooms would be used to accommodate guests. The colour scheme is based on research carried out by the trust into Culzean Castle which was being decorated at the time Charlotte Square was being built. Second and Third Floors Most visitors to the house choose to begin the tour in the second floor. Here there is a short film which introduces the visitors to the history of the New Town, and to the lifestyle of the Lamont family and their servants in around the year 1810. These two floors have not been restored, as until recently they were used as the flat of the Moderator of the Church of Scotland. Nowadays on the Second Floor there are public toilets, and one of the larger rooms has been opened up as an activity room for young and old where they can handle objects which were common in the Georgian times and guess what they were used for, write with a feather quill pen, and the children can try on some Georgian style clothes.  Visitor Information  The Georgian House is open from 1 March to 30 November. Opening hours for most of the season are 10am to 5pm, last admission at 4.30pm.

The exact reasons of the fighting, the course of events, and the resulting destruction and deaths are disputed. The government claimed that it clashed with Islamist-leaning insurgents who had set up an ambush for security forces, while the Syrian opposition described the Jisr ash-Shugur clashes as crackdown against pro- democracy protesters, resulting in a mutiny among soldiers and a large battle with many people being massacred by pro-government forces. The fighting in the city lasted from 4 until 12 June 2011. Today, the clashes are seen as the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, as well as the first battle of the war. They were also viewed this way back in 2011. Prelude Syrian security forces allegedly open fire on protestors in Jisr ash-Shugur on 5 May 2011. Protests in Idlib Governorate, where Jisr ash-Shugur was located, became widespread in April 2011. These were quickly suppressed through the presence of \\"huge numbers\\" of policemen and intelligence agents. As time went on, however, new protests sprung up and spread to such an degree that the government could no longer contain them. This was especially problematic, as large parts of the Syrian security forces were already restive and unwilling to curb civil protests. The first protests also took place in Jisr ash-Shugur from 18 March, and quickly became regular events. The town was an \\"Islamist stronghold\\" and many locals hated the government because they had lost relatives during the Islamist uprising in Syria of 1979‚Äì1982. The protests occurred without incident until 30 April when security forces arrested about 40 people who were subsequently tortured. Large protests on 2 May forced the release of the arrested. By this point, a small group of radical locals already prepared an insurgency. Their leader, only known as Mohammad, enlisted the help of six Salafists from Latakia. These men successively attacked a dozen small police stations around the town, capturing some guns and policemen. They allowed the latter to leave. On 13 May, large demonstrations erupted in violence, as protestors set fire to Jisr ash-Shugur's Ba'ath Party office. On 3 June, about 30,000 protestors marched in Jisr al-Shughour. Security forces dispersed the crowd with tear gas and by firing into the air. That same day, a local family father, Basil al-Masri, was killed. Most believed that he had been shot during the demonstration. In fact, however, Basil al-Masri had been armed and was killed during an attempted attack on a security outpost near Jisr ash-Shugur's railway station. He was probably motivated by hatred for the government because his family had suffered greatly during the old Islamist uprising, and many of his relatives had been murdered by government agents. Regardless, he had not been a member of Mohammad's group and few knew that he had attacked someone when he was shot. People were outraged, believing that an innocent civilian had been executed.  Clashes  = Initial uprising = On 4 June, thousands turned up for Basil al-Masri's funeral. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, about 20,000 people gathered for the funeral. Unbeknownst to most, both Mohammad's group as well as government snipers were lying in wait. Eventually, Mohammad and his followers opened fire at the post office where the snipers were stationed. These responded by firing into the crowd, killing five or 14 and wounding dozens. One of those killed was Hassan Malesh who was holding a speech when he was shot. Panic erupted, and many promptly fled the town for Turkey. However, several mourners were armed, many of them from villages in the countryside who deeply hated the government because their families had been targeted during the purges of the 1980s. They assaulted the station, burning it and killing eight security officers. This marked the beginning of a full uprising. The Syrian Air Force's helicopters promptly responded, and began to strafe the town. The rebels rushed to the local offices of the Political and State Security Directorates, close to the post station. The agents at these locations surrendered to the rebels who numbered hundreds by then, and were allowed to leave. In contrast, the Military Intelligence agents refused to give up, whereupon the insurgents shot at their office and threw dynamite at it. Some locals called for peace, but were ignored. Eventually, the irregulars used a bulldozer to bring a barrel with explosives to the building, thereby opening a path for the attackers. Some agents were killed in the firefight, others by the explosion, and at least one was executed when the rebels stormed the building. There were also claims that policemen had refused to open fire on protesters, whereupon these officers were executed by government loyalists. The opposition initially claimed that the victims of these events were civilian protesters, and reported several incidents when unarmed people were executed by security forces. Later on, the opposition claimed that a local Syrian Army battalion mutinied during this time, allegedly in protest against the murder of unarmed locals. According to this version, secret police and intelligence agents promptly killed about fifty mutineers, but were then overwhelmed by the rest of the battalion. Shortly after the clashes in Jisr ash-Shugur, researcher Joshua Landis already criticised that the story of a mutiny and clashes between soldiers was based on little evidence, mostly hearsay from pro-opposition refugees. According to him, the stories of fighting among security forces were probably spread deliberately to induce actual mutinies. Later on, several locals confirmed that the story about the mutiny had been fake, and was spread to inspire a revolt. An actual defector, Lt. Col. Hussein Harmoush had been selected to give this story weight. He proclaimed that he had come to Jisr ash-Shugur in hopes of defending civilians, and founded the Free Officers Movement to rally other soldiers to the opposition's cause. In any case, rebels quickly seized control of Jisr ash-Shugur, taking weapons from the area's military bases and police stations. Some defectors from military units began to travel to the area, and pro-opposition sources claimed that up to 2,000 rebel soldiers eventually amassed in the town, declaring themselves \\"free\\". In fact, their number was much smaller. Most of the insurgents in Jisr ash-Shugur were armed civilians, supported by a small group of defected soldiers. The government sent a unit of about 120 soldiers and policemen to restore control over Jisr ash-Shugur. They were ambushed and killed before it even reached the town around 6 June. According to Syrian state TV, one group of about 20 policemen was killed when responding to calls by locals who asked for help, stating that unknown gunmen were terrorising them. In another incident, rebels overran a police command center where they killed 82 members of the security forces. Syria TV claimed that a number of the bodies of policemen were mutilated with some of them being thrown into the river. Mohammad later admitted that he and his followers filmed themselves burying the dead loyalists, but portrayed them as victims of government suppression for propaganda purposes. The Syrian government later released tapped phone calls which indicated that the rebels had lured the government loyalists into an elaborate ambush: Women and children were sent to Turkey, spreading horror stories of massacres at the hands of soldiers, while the men called the security forces for help only to attack them upon entering Jisr ash-Shugur. Landis argued that the government's story about the ambush was plausible. As violence escalated, than 4,000 locals fled to Turkey, many opposed to violence in general, others out of hatred for the government and fear of retribution by security forces. The government downplayed the exodus, claiming that the locals were just visiting relatives and that the military intended to rescue civilians who were used as human shields. = Counter-insurgency operation = Upon being informed of the events at Jisr ash-Shugur, the Syrian government resolved to crush the rebels at all cost, lest the uprising inspire more soldiers to revolt. It could not allow the spreading of rumours about the mass killing of security forces, talk of a mutiny, and the establishment of \\"liberated areas\\". The government thus switched to a full military response to the Jisr ash-Shugur crisis. It mobilized 4th Armoured Division elements (including the 555th Airborne Regiment) commanded by Brig. Gen. Sharif in Daraa and sent them to Jisr ash- Shugur. These forces were bolstered by the 35th Syrian Special Mission Forces (SF) Regiment and the remnants of the 76th Brigade. As they advanced towards the town, the loyalists were temporarily stopped at the Orontes River because the rebels had blown up several bridges. Syrian security forces eventually reached Jisr ash-Shugur on 8 June, and took up positions at the town's sugar factory. It is disputed what happened next. Both the opposition as well as the government claimed that a fierce battle erupted. The insurgents reportedly offered heavy resistance, and the loyalists responded with extreme violence. They often executed captured rebel soldiers, killed numerous civilians, and burned parts of the town as well as surrounding fields. An army general claimed that the troops were only trying to find those responsible for the earlier deaths and deniend that shelling or other attacks on civilians had taken place. Local loyalist civilians later claimed that the rebels had also burned the fields of government sympathizers. The attacking security forces reportedly suffered numerous casualties, forcing the government to send reinforcements in the form of the 46th and 55th SF Regiments and the 8th Brigade. Loyalist Shabiha militias were also employed. The Syrian Air Force used helicopters to bomb the city, weakening its defenses. This allowed the government forces to launch a final attack on 12 June, from the south and east, using up to 200 military vehicles, including tanks, as well as helicopters. According to Syrian state media, troops battled \\"army units and members of armed organisations taking up positions in the surroundings of Jisr al-Shughour and inside it.\\" In contrast to these reports, local witnesses stated that the city was almost empty by the time security forces entered, encountering little resistance. According to Landis, the scale of the battle as well as the losses of pro-government troops might have been exaggerated by both loyalists as well as rebels for propaganda reasons. Syrian politician Bouthaina Shaaban, an advisor to President Assad, also stated that \\"only minor security operations\\" took place in the town. By the time Jisr ash-Shugur was secured, 50,000 people had fled the area. Most of the captured rebel soldiers and hundreds of civilians who had been arrested during the counter-insurgency operation \\"were never seen again\\".  Aftermath  The Jisr ash-Shugur clashes led to widespread reports about alleged massacres in the town, resulting in growing national and international support for the Syrian opposition. The crackdown was also condemned by Turkey which consequently turned against the Syrian government, and increased its support for the armed opposition. Shaaban later alleged that Turkey had been part of the rebel-initiated \\"fear-mongering campaign\\", as it had set up refugee camps even before the fighting at Jisr ash-Shugur had begun. The government attempted to respond, and gave foreign delegates a tour of the town a few days after the clashes had ended. This had no impact on international opinion, and the visit by the delegates was ignored by mass media.

It is located along Oregon Route 218 near the John Day River. The community was named after Andrew Clarno, an early settler. The Clarno post office was established in 1894 in what was then Gilliam County, from which Wheeler County was later carved. After that, the post office was sometimes in Wheeler County, on the east side of the river, or in Wasco County, on the west side, depending on who was postmaster. The office closed in 1949. Charles Clarno, Andrew's son, built a miniature steamboat, The John Day Queen, used as a ferry and for pleasure trips. Propelled by steam from a wood-fired boiler, the craft plied the river from upstream of Clarno to about below. After a bridge was constructed at Clarno in 1897, the younger Clarno decided to float the boat down the John Day River to the Columbia River and then down the Columbia to Portland. The attempt ended in failure at Clarno Rapids, slightly beyond where the boat normally traveled. There The John Day Queen broke free from guide ropes held by Charles Clarno and his friends and smashed on the rocks downstream. The spark arrestor from the boat was later rescued and donated to the city museum in Fossil.

The Mondial ride opened to the public in May 2001 and continues to operate today. The ride spins around on an angle while guests (while restrained on the seats) are spun around on almost every possible angle the ride operates on. Also, during the first season of operation (2001), Shockwave earned many different nicknames such as 'Protein Spill 2001'. Structure Shockwave is made up of four main pieces. The first one are the supports. They move the riders seats high into the air to prevent the ride from hitting the ground and causing injury to riders. The second part is the arm. It is what is connected to the supports and holds the rows where riders sit in. Because the arm is always on an angle, weights are placed on the top of the arm (opposite to the seats) to balance the weight of the front of the ride to the back. The third part are the rows of seats themselves. This is where riders sit for the ride. When the ride is in operation, the rows of seats are \\"thrown\\" around and \\"throw\\" riders on every possible angle the ride can operate on. Ride experience The ride begins by the seats raising off the ground to prevent injury when the ride begins spinning. Once the ride has reached the safe distance off of the ground, the arm begins to swing riders around in one direction. Riders continue to be spun around until the half-way point on the ride where the arm stops and begins to spin again this time towards the other direction. When the ride cycle has been completed, the arm stops rotating and the seats are returned to the ground (\\"loading position\\").

Knowles was born into a distinguished naval family, with his father rising to the rank of admiral and receiving a baronetcy for his services. Edward followed him into the navy, and served with several important officers in operations during the Seven Years' War, which he spent mostly in North American waters. He supported the sieges of Louisbourg and Quebec and made the acquaintance of the natural philosopher John Robison, who spent some time as his mathematics tutor. Knowles was eventually promoted to command his own ship, an elderly and much reworked vessel, which already had a reputation for being difficult to steer. He set off in poor weather to deliver important despatches to the British commands in the Bay of Biscay but never returned. His ship was presumed to have foundered at sea with the loss of all hands.  Family and early life  Edward Knowles was born in 1744, the only son from the marriage of Captain Charles Knowles and Mary Alleyne, the sister of John Alleyne. His father became a noted naval officer, rising to the rank of admiral and receiving a baronetcy for his services to his country. Edward attended Eton College and then followed his father into the navy. He first served with a colleague of his father, Captain Richard Howe, of . He afterwards went out with Admiral Sir Charles Saunders to the Siege of Louisbourg in February 1759, aboard the 90-gun . Accompanying him as his personal mathematics tutor was John Robison, who spent the next few years with Edward, and would later serve with his father as a personal secretary. At Louisbourg Knowles took part in the assault on the 64-gun French ship Prudent, anchored in the harbour, and was later promoted to lieutenant during the voyage and operations to capture Quebec. He transferred to the 100-gun HMS Royal William to serve his commission.  Command  After his extended service in North America, Knowles was promoted to commander and appointed to the sloop HMS Peregrine in 1761. Peregrine was the former royal yacht Royal Caroline, which had been fitted with a poop deck, which consequently made it difficult to wear ship. Knowle's tutor Robison had initially hoped to be made purser of the ship, but found her small size less congenial than the larger men of war he had served on, and left after seeing some service in the Bay of Biscay and Lisbon. After some time in command of HMS Peregrine, Knowles was promoted and a commission made out for him as post captain by the Admiralty. It never reached him.  Final voyage  The Peregrine (later renamed the Royal Caroline) in Two Positions off the Coast, 1766 by John Cleveley the Elder The imminent declaration of war with Spain necessitated the sending of despatches to the British commands at Belle Isle and Lisbon, and Knowles was entrusted with the task. He rendezvoused with the fleet under Commodore Augustus Keppel off Belle Isle and passed on the news. Keppel attempted to persuade Knowles not to put to sea again owing to the stormy weather, but Knowles convinced Keppel to allow him to continue on. Keppel relented, and Peregrine put to sea. She was never seen again. It was assumed that she had foundered with the loss of all hands on or sometime after 28 December 1761.  Legacy  Knowles predeceased his father, the baronetcy was therefore inherited by Sir Charles Knowles's second son, Charles, Edward's half brother. A posthumous portrait of Edward was commissioned from Francis Cotes, based on a silhouette and a description from his father.  Notes  a. The birth date of 1744 may be an error. The entry for Edward's father in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography records that Mary Alleyne died in 1742. b. Peregrine was an elderly ship by this time. She had been launched in 1700 as Peregrine Galley, a 20-gun sixth rate but renamed Carolina in 1716 and converted into a royal yacht. She had been rebuilt and renamed Royal Caroline in 1733, reclassified as a sixth rate in 1739, and finally converted to a sloop and renamed Peregrine. c. This proved to be a fortuitous decision for Robison, who went on to become a respected natural philosopher and inventor, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

She foundered in 1807 in the Mediterranean without leaving a trace. Privateer Prior to circa May 1799 Moucheron was named Actif, but she was not the former French naval brig Actif, built in Bordeaux. Moucheron was commissioned at Bordeaux in May 1799. She made her first cruise between May 1799 and some time in 1800. She was armed with 18 guns and had a crew of 130 men under Captain Jean Lugeol. On 18 July 1800, Moucheron and another privateer, Abeille, captured the American ship Josephus and brought her into Cadiz. There the French Consul released the vessel and her cargo. The privateers appealed to the prize court in Paris, which upheld the release. At some point Moucheron captured the American ship Argo, Thomas Chipman, master, and brought her into port. The Council of Prizes at Paris ordered Argos release on 3 September. For her second cruise, Moucheron, of 16 guns and 120 men, was under the command of Captain Pruvost. She started her cruise in January 1801. Capture On 16 February 1801, captured Moucheron. Moucheron was armed with sixteen 6 and 12-pounder guns, and had a crew of 130 men. She was 20 days out of Passages and had captured the British brig William, of London, which had been sailing from St. Michael's with a cargo of fruit. British service Moucheron arrived in Plymouth on 7 March 1801. The Government purchased her in 1802 and she was fitting out at Plymouth in June 1803,Naval Chronicle, Vol. 12, p.523. when Commander James Hawes commissioned her. He had been promoted in 1802 and was given the best sloop available at the time. On 15 November 1803, Moucheron was in company with and off Alderney when Poulette came across a French convoy of some 30 transports plus armed escorts. Poulette was able to run the vessels ashore and her boats captured three, a brig, a lugger and a sloop. Unfortunately, Moucheron was unable to come up in time though Liberty did. The British suffered no casualties. On 22 January 1804 Dorchester came into Plymouth. A French lugger privateer had captured her, but Moucheron had recaptured her. Dorchester, Mobery, master, had been sailing from Bristol to Falmouth. The lugger had also captured five other vessels.Lloyd's List (LL) 27 January 1804, ‚Ññ4422. On 2 March 1804 the French privateer lugger Sorcier captured two merchantmen, Rising Sun and William and Mary in the Bristol Channel. Rising Sun, Batchelor, mastre, had been sailing from Youghall to Poole, and William and Mary, Skean, master, had been sailing from Padstow to Bridport, Moucheron recaptured them on 5 March and sent them into Guernsey on 8 March.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 11, p.423. On 3 February 1805 Moucheron recaptured the ship , Lewes, master, and her cargo. The French privateer Braave, of 18 guns and 160 men, had captured Cambridge while she was on her way from Jamaica to Liverpool. After her recapture by Moucheron, Cambridge reached Cork on 14 February.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 14, p.176. At around the same time Moucheron recaptured the brig Speedwell and her cargo. On 8 February Moucheron was under the command of a Captain Reed when she sailed with sealed orders that had arrived by special King's Messenger. They were of such importance that the Admiral sent the messenger on board with them, and she sailed directly.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 13, p.242. In April 1805 Moucheron was in the Mediterranean. Lord Nelson had her patrol the Straits of Gibraltar and provide the garrison of Gibraltar such assistance as they might require. On 3 August 1805, , left St Helena as escort of a motley convoy to England. On 26 September 1805 the convoy was in the Channel south of the Isles of Scilly when it encountered a French squadron. It turned out this was Allemand's squadron. Calcutta was forced to strike, but not before she had bought time for the convoy to escape. Moucheron was in the vicinity and sailed to the sound of the guns. She then proceeded to cruise with Allemand‚Äôs squadron, which paid her no attention as she was flying an American flag. Moucheron counted the French ships and then, having completed her reconnaissance, sailed to notify Admiral Lord Cornwallis at Brest. However, by the time Cornwallis arrived at the spot where Moucheron had left Allemand, he had left. On 7 and 9 April 1806 Moucheron, by this time, and perhaps earlier, again under Hawse's command, captured the Prussian galliot Jonge Cornelius and the ship Mercurius, which carrying eight cases of coffee.

He was Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Ionian Islands, Adjutant-General to the British Forces and Heritable Usher of the White Rod for Scotland. He is buried at Westminster Abbey. Birth The eldest son of Sir James Campbell (1737‚Äì1805), of Killean, 2nd of Inverneill House, Heritable Usher of the White Rod for Scotland and Member of Parliament for the Stirling Burghs. His father was recognized as the 9th Chief of Clan Tearlach, a branch of Campbell of Craignish, by the Lord Lyon King of Arms in 1791. He was a nephew of his father's brother, General Sir Archibald Campbell, the Governor of Madras who purchased the Inverneill estate in 1773. His mother, Jean (died 1805), was the daughter of John Campbell of Askomil, Argyll, of the Ballachlavan Campbells.G. Harvey Johnston, The Heraldry of the Campbells, vol. II (1921) pp. 70‚Äì71. His sister, Jane Campbell, was the first woman to petition a private bill get a full divorce in the United Kingdom. Military career Campbell was commissioned into the 1st Royal Scots Regiment of Foot in 1780, making Lieutenant the following year. He immediately exchanged into the 60th (Royal American) Regiment, serving with them during the last two campaigns of the American War of Independence. On its conclusion, he was promoted to Captain in 1783. In 1787, he joined the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot in India, as aide-de-camp to his uncle, General Sir Archibald Campbell, who served as the Governor of Madras until 1789. He exchanged into the 19th Light Dragoons, serving in the three campaigns of the Third Anglo- Mysore War under Lord Cornwallis against Tippoo Sahib. In March 1794, he was promoted to Major, and on returning to England in November of that year was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel of the Cheshire Fencibles. He served in the Channel Islands and Ireland until 1800, when he was appointed assistant Adjutant-General at the Horse Guards. In 1801, he was promoted Colonel by brevet and in 1804 he was appointed Lieutenant Colonel of the 61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot. In 1805, he was appointed Adjutant General to the force destined for the Mediterranean under Sir James Henry Craig for the Anglo-Russian invasion of Naples. He acted in that capacity from 1805 to 1813, and was only absent on the occasion of the Battle of Maida, winning the confidence of all the generals who held command in Sicily. Governor of the Ionian Islands In 1810, General Cavaignac managed to get 3,500 men safely across the Straits of Messina, placing one battalion on the cliffs while the others were fast disembarking. Campbell, by a rapid attack with the Royal Scots Fusiliers, repelled the disembarking battalions and forced those already landed to surrender. Forty three officers and over eight hundred men were taken prisoners, with a loss to the British of only three men wounded. During his tenure of office, in 1808, he had been promoted Major General, and Lieutenant General in 1813. The following year, in 1814, he was appointed to take possession of the Ionian Islands, and when the French Governor, Fran√ßois- Xavier Donzelot, refused to hand over the government of the Islands, Campbell threatened to open fire. He remained in the Ionian Islands as Governor and Commander-in-Chief until 1816, when Sir Thomas Maitland was appointed Lord High Commissioner. A French authority stated that Campbell acted in a most despotic way as governor, saying that he abolished the university, the academy and the press established by the French. He returned to England in 1816. The following year he was made Knight Grand Cross of Hanover of the Royal Guelphic Order. On 3 October 1818, he was created the 1st (and last) Baronet of Inverneill. He was a Commander of the Order of Saint Ferdinand and of Merit. Private life (Mrs James) Lady Campbell of Inverneill. Following the death of his father in 1805, he became the 10th Chief of Clan Tearlach and inherited the position of Heritable Usher of the White Rod for Scotland, selling the title to Sir Patrick Walker in 1806. In 1794, he had married Agnes Margaret, the daughter of one of the most distinguished surgeons and scientists of his day, John Hunter, for whom the Hunterian Society of London is named. Agnes' mother, Anne (Home) Hunter, daughter of Robert Boyne Home of Greenlaw Castle, Berwickshire, and the sister of Sir Everard Home, 1st Bt., of Well Manor, Southampton. She was described by the author Fanny Burney as \\"extremely pretty and reckoned very ingenious\\". Some of the poems of Agnes' mother, Anne Home were used to the music of Joseph Haydn. Campbell was very close to his mother- in-law, Anne Hunter, and provided her with a small annuity. As such, Mrs Hunter was greatly saddened and disappointed in her daughter when she separated from Campbell. Campbell died without issue 5 June 1819, and is buried with his own monument at Westminster Abbey, near to his distinguished uncle General Sir Archibald Campbell. After his death his baronetcy became extinct and the Inverneill estate was passed to his brothers, the 4th and 5th lairds of Inverneill.

Originally known as Gay Student Services (GSS), the organization was officially recognized by Texas A&M; University in 1985 after a lengthy court battle.  History  In the spring semester of 1976, a group of Texas A&M; students organized a gay support group. In April of that year Michael Minton, Michael Garrett, and Sherri Skinner approached John Koldus, the Texas A&M; Vice President for Student Affairs, and requested limited recognition for an organization to support gay issues. The students did not want full university recognition, which included partial funding from student fees as well as official office space in the Student Programs Office, because several of their members wished to be discreet about their sexual orientation. Instead, the group requested only meeting space on campus and the right to post notices on school bulletin boards and in the student newspaper.Pinello (2003), p. 57. Koldus informed the students that the university did not offer limited recognition, and that to gain the access they had asked for the students must apply for full official status.Pinello (2003), p. 58. What followed was the lengthy court battle Gay Student Services v. Texas A&M; University. At the conclusion of the litigation, GSS was recognized as an official student organization by legal decision in April 1985. Over the years, the name of the organization has evolved to be more inclusive. Today GLBT Aggies is an organization for queer people and straight allies alike, where anyone is welcome to join regardless of how they identify.  Organization  GLBT Aggies is led by an executive council of democratically elected members. Elections are held at the end of the academic year, with special elections held for vacant seats during the academic year as needed. Elected positions include: President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, Historian, and Social Chair. GLBT Aggies also has a seat on the Graduate Student Council. This position is appointed by the elected officers of the GLBTA. These leaders make up the voting members of the Executive Council, and it is their responsibility to establish programming, set policy, and guide the organization to better serve its members. The organization also has up to two advisors who hold non-voting seats on the executive committee. The Advisors are selected by the elected leaders of GLBT Aggies each year.  Campus activities  Flyer attached to the \\"gay? fine by me\\" T-shirt giveaway in April 2011 = General meetings = GLBT Aggies hosts weekly meetings that provide an opportunity for members to socialize, learn about the history and current issues affecting members of the GLBT community, and organize outreach efforts within the Bryan-College Station area. = \\"gay? fine by me.\\" = In April 2010, 2011, and 2012 on the National Day of Silence GLBT Aggies partnered with Atticus Circle to bring the Fine By Me T-shirt project to the Texas A&M; campus. Each year, GLBT Aggies was able to fundraise enough money to give away 1,000 T-shirts bearing the phrase \\"gay? fine by me.\\" In 2012 GLBT Aggies were the first group to expand the Fine By Me project to include T-shirts bearing the phrases: \\"lesbian? fine by me.\\" \\"bisexual? fine by me.\\" and \\"transgender? fine by me.\\" = Community outreach = GLBT Aggies has participated in many activities designed to engage and educate citizens of the broader Bryan-College Station area about the GLBT community. The organization has officially participated in MSC Open House, The Big Event, and the Day of Silence. The organization has also occasionally set up a table in Academic Plaza, where they distribute information on upcoming activities.  Campus environment  Texas A&M; is often perceived as an unwelcoming university to GLBT students, a challenge GLBT Aggies has faced since the initial struggle for GLBT recognition. See Gay Student Services v. Texas A&M; University. In 2011 and 2012 it was ranked as the least-LGBT friendly public university in the United States by the Princeton Review. During the 2011 Texas legislative session, the Texas A&M; Student Senate and state representative Wayne Christian filed concurrent bills that would require public universities in Texas to spend equal state dollars on a center promoting \\"traditional and family values\\" as campus GLBT resource centers. The measure eventually failed in the Texas A&M; Student Senate after the student body president vetoed the bill. The bill in the Texas legislature was ultimately withdrawn by the author after a point of order was raised that would have derailed the entire budget bill it was attached to. A similar measure was introduced in the Texas A&M; Student Senate in March 2013. The proposed bill would allow students with religious objections to \\"opt-out\\" of paying a portion of their student fees to the Texas A&M; GLBT Resource Center. In a statement, the organization called the bill \\"a direct and blatant attack against the LGBT Aggie community.\\" They continued: On April 4, 2013, the Texas A&M; Student Senate passed the bill by a vote of 35 in favor and 28 against. On April 5, 2013, the Student Body President at Texas A&M; University, John Claybrook, vetoed the bill. In the fall of 2013, GLBT Aggies officially changed its name to LGBTQ Aggies. This change shows homage to the modern gay rights movement, in which feminists exerted their rights to be known. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Aggies strive to be inclusive of all identities, and this positive change allows for open dialogue to occur in an ill informed society. On November 14, 2018, the Texas A&M; Student Senate passed a resolution that expressed support for the LGBT community at Texas A&M; and GLBT Resource Center. Paired with a resolution in support of constructing more gender- inclusive restrooms on campus, this legislation was the first positive legislation regarding LGBT students to pass through the Student Senate.

Introduction  Part of a six-volume series documenting the history of Europe, the first volume of Magill's History of Europe identifies and elaborates upon the key events in European history from the dawn of civilization until the year 451. Rather than address historical trends in lengthy narratives, it highlights the situations and repercussions surrounding individual events that shaped Europe and includes analyses of two comprehensive works describing each of them. Primarily written for those conducting scholarly research, it contains a large collection of references and assumes its readers have a moderate knowledge of European history. Unlike most historical works, it does not attempt to form a particular or overall impression of European history; instead, it strives to give the reader additional insight into specific events and better clarification of the situations surrounding them. Its descriptions of little- known events like the Battle of Kadesh, the Naval Law of Themistocles, and Marius's creation of a professional Roman army help explain the underlying reasons behind the isolation of Egypt from the rest of Europe, the superiority of Athens over many of its fellow Greek cities, and the transformation of the Roman military into a force designed for conquest (Magill, 1993). It downplays the praise of several seemingly notable achievements, particularly the Code of Hammurabi and the Battle of Zama (Magill, 1993). Popular misconceptions of the magnanimity of Julius Caesar and the democracy of Athens are shattered by its revelation of the biased accounts of Julius Caesar's Gallic conquests and the political inequalities in Athens (Magill, 1993). In spite of its potentially controversial topics, the book still tries to steer clear of unscholarly bias and prejudice, a necessity for scholars seeking serious facts and not mere opinions.

The Instituto soon became a centre for the publication of highly conservative scholarship in which historical revisionism about Argentina's past loomed large.Rock, Authoritarian Argentina, p. 120 Liga Republicana Along with Rodolfo Irazusta he established the Liga Republicana youth movement around 1927, the aim of which was to undermine the government. The group was united by the members hatred of Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen although significant elements within the Liga were inspired by the fascism of Benito Mussolini as well as the ideas of Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella.Sandra McGee Deutsch, Social origins of counterrevolution in Argentina, 1900-1932. De Laferr√®re was insistent that the Liga should not become a political party and he clashed with Irazusta over the issue when the latter suggested presenting a list for the 1930 election. De Laferr√®re and Juan Carulla's idea, that the Liga should support the Independent Socialists, was endorsed and Irazusta resigned from the movement. Following the establishment of the Argentine Civic Legion in 1931 Laferr√®re began to wane in his support for Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu and eventually withdrew his Liga Republicana from the movement, citing the \\"lumpen\\" nature of what was approaching a mass movement, as well as it ties to mainstream conservatism. As a consequence of de Laferr√®re's split other nationalist intellectuals followed suit.Deutsch, Las Derechas, pp. 200-201 Later years Like many of his nationalist colleagues de Laferr√®re had a strong strain of anti-Americanism in his thought and this increased during the Second World War. He argued in 1941 that Argentina should adopt a neutral position and should instead concentrate on strengthening its own army in order to ensure it could defend itself rather than spending on supporting the American war effort. His views influenced Enrique Ruiz Gui√±az√∫, who had been appointed as Foreign Minister.Rock, Authoritarian Argentina, p. 131 However, despite his own anti-Semitism, de Laferr√®re was not a supporter of Nazism and rather endorsed an isolationist policy for Argentina. Suspicious of all overseas powers, with the exception of France which he declared his support for in 1939, he argued in early 1941 that \\"today our worst enemies are the British and Jews. Tomorrow they could be the Yanks or the Germans\\".Rock, Authoritarian Argentina, p. 130 His anti-British sentiment was a common feature of nationalist rhetoric in Argentina, deriving in part from the issue's surrounding the Falkland or Malvinas Islands sovereignty dispute as well what the nationalists portrayed as a history of mistreatment at the hands of Britain through a series of loans with very high interest rates after independence, British involvement in the independence of Uruguay and the settling of her borders at the expense of Argentina and a form of commercial imperialism that de Laferr√®re felt had caused the Argentine Civil Wars.Rock, Authoritarian Argentina, p. 116 Unlike some of his fellow nationalists de Laferr√®re was not an enthusiastic supporter of Juan Per√≥n and he scoffed at what he saw as Per√≥n's cowardice when he was ousted from the Presidency in 1955.Rock, Authoritarian Argentina, p. 161 References Category:1900 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Argentine historians Category:Argentine political writers Category:Argentine people of French descent Category:Republican League (Argentina) politicians Category:20th-century historians Category:20th-century Argentine male writers ","title":"Roberto de Laferr√®re"},{"id":"32004866","text":"D√°ibh√≠ de Barra (D√°ibh√≠ Do Barra) (c. 1758‚Äì1851) was a farmer, poet, and author in the Irish language.

Powerpuff Girls Z Unlike their original counterparts, the heroines of the anime reimagining are ordinary eighth graders who are not related to each other or the Professor. Instead of always being superheroes, they are given the power to transform into the Powerpuff Girls Z. In the English dub, they are simply called Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup regardless of whether they are transformed or not. =Momoko \\"Blossom\\" Akatsutsumi / Hyper Blossom= / Hyper Blossom („Éè„Ç§„Éë„Éº„Éª„Éñ„É≠„ÉÉ„Çµ„É† HaipƒÅ Burossamu) : :The leader and first member of the Powerpuff Girls Z with orange hair with a red bow, and pink eyes. She uses a yo-yo as her signature weapon, but she can use her bow as a weapon if she doesn't have her yo-yo. Like the original, she's the self-proclaimed leader of the team. However, she is extremely ditzy, a bit boy-crazy, given to crushes and romantic fantasies. She wears a midriff dress in normal clothing. She is very familiar with the mahou shojo genre, along with some typical anime/super sentai concepts and is regarded as a \\"hero maniac\\" in school, especially by Kaoru. Momoko also has a strong appetite for sugary foods. Momoko was the first to encounter Mojo Jojo at the park after buying candy. If she doesn't eat sweets for a long time she can get very cranky. But she is getting used to it. Although often distracted and has been known to whine, Momoko tries her best to protect Tokyo City, lead the girls, and help her friends regardless of her situation. In one instance, when Momoko is unable to transform, she tries to fight alongside Miyako and Kaoru wearing a sentai hero mask. Often she can be very clever and crafty when needed, usually being the first to come up with a plan to trick or defeat a monster that the girls are having trouble with. She has a younger sister named Kuriko. She plans to be married in the future. Her theme color is pink (also known as the color red). She is represented by hearts. =Miyako \\"Bubbles\\" G≈çtokuji / Rolling Bubbles= / Rolling Bubbles („É≠„Éº„É™„É≥„Ç∞„Éª„Éê„Éñ„É´„Çπ R≈çringu Baburusu) : :The second member of the Powerpuff Girls Z team with lemon yellow hair with a sky blue hair clip, and matching eyes who uses a bubble wand as her signature weapon. Compared to her original counterpart, who is known for being the most childish of the three, Miyako is comparatively mature and often acts as the mediator in many situations and tries to calm her teammates down when in such situations. However, she is the ditziest member of the team, often appearing a bit clueless, and doesn't seem to understand her powers completely, along with a few other things. She is also very polite and always uses honorifics at the end of names and ends most of her sentences with \\"desu wa\\". She is more concerned with shopping, her appearance and her outfits, and perhaps because of this, she seems to be very popular among her male classmates. While she seems oblivious to the many boys that love her, she's already in love with a boy named Takaaki, a boy on whom she has had a crush ever since she was six years old. She retains her hairstyle during the reimagining, but her pigtails are slightly longer and curl into ringlets. She also uses curlers (3 balls on each pigtail) when going to bed. Miyako is a compassionate, gentle, and innocent character, possessing a love for animals and her favorite doll, Octi. Her theme color is sky blue. She is represented by bubbles. =Kaoru \\"Buttercup\\" Matsubara / Powered Buttercup= / Powered Buttercup („Éë„ÉØ„Éº„Éâ„Éª„Éê„Çø„Éº„Ç´„ÉÉ„Éó PawƒÅdo BatƒÅkappu) : :The third and final member of the Powerpuff Girls Z with grey hair with two green hair clips, and green eyes who uses a giant mallet as her signature weapon. Like the original Buttercup, she is a tomboy and is the most easily enraged of the three. Kaoru is known at school for being the most athletic girl as she plays tennis, practices martial arts, and numerous other activities, and spends a great deal of time watching sports on television. She is especially good at soccer due to her strengthened determination after receiving new soccer cleats when she was younger. This may be part of the reason why she has so many fangirls, much to her dismay. She detests anything girly, particular skirts, which makes wearing the Powerpuff uniform a bit more awkward. She speaks with a hard and masculine edge and rarely uses honorifics when speaking. Kaoru lives with her parents and her two brothers, the father of which is a professional masked-wrestler. Her theme colors are green and yellow. She is represented by stars. Supporting characters =Allies= ; : :In Powerpuff Girls Z, Professor Utonium has a son named Ken Kitazawa, who is responsible for all those affected by the Chemical Z lights, especially the Powerpuff Girls Z. Professor Utonium was originally experimenting with the substance Chemical X and strove to find a way to change its chemical properties. Professor Utonium has created several inventions throughout the series; the most important one being his Chemical Z Particle Ray, which allows him to transform those affected by the lights back to normal (although it doesn't prevent recurring transformations nor is it able to work on all black light victims). He seems to be aware of the effect Ken's lack of a mother has had on his son, assuming that it had caused him to be a bully to the girls. However, this does not change his behavior towards Ken. He appears to be a gentle father figure like the original Professor Utonium was in The Powerpuff Girls. He treats the girls like members of his family and is very close to the Mayor and Miss Bellum. While he is very gentle and serious, Professor Utonium may, at times, act a little less mature than he usually does. In episode 37, when the Powerpuff Girls Z are \\"grounded\\" from using their powers for a day when they have to take a test in school, Professor Utonium fills in for them, donning an exosuit with a laser beam gun and rocket pack, calling himself \\"Professor Puff Z\\" (this is most likely based on the American cartoon episode \\"Powerprof\\" in which he also donned a fighting suit but drove the girls crazy with lame one-liners during battles). He also appears to have a mecha that looks like Professor Puff Z, which he uses against the Mojo Robo. Although he seems unsuccessful at first, he is able to defeat Mojo Jojo, Fuzzy Lumpkins, and the Amoeba Boys. His main attack is the Uto Beam. At the end of the episode, Ken, Peach and himself call themselves \\"Powerpuff Boys Z\\" as their own self-proclaimed superhero team. Ken Kitazawa (ÂåóÊ≤¢ „Ç±„É≥ Kitazawa Ken) : :Professor Utonium's eight-year-old son who is somewhat responsible for turning regular girls into the Powerpuff Girls Z and numerous other characters into villains using Chemical Z. He used it to blast a glacier in order to set the weather back to normal, but the impact resulted in the explosion of several lights, which affected all those who came in contact with it. Despite being younger than the girls, he acts a lot more mature and the education he receives from his father is considered more advanced than what the girls learn in their school, earning his PhD at an early age. Ken, in a later episode, attended school in order to gain social skills and make friends. While he considers grade school life boring, he has made several friends, including Jou, who was originally his rival and Kuriko who is Momoko's young sister. Ken sees the girls as older sisters and has to often put up with them, though he still cares for them deeply. Ken interchanges between calling Professor Utonium \\"Dad\\" and \\"Professor\\". During a serious situation (such as a monster attack or investigation) he will try to refer to Utonium as \\"Professor,\\" but in less serious situations (like packing a lunch) he will call him \\"Dad.\\" Ken often corrects himself, because he usually uses the wrong honorific (e.g. \\"Dad, I mean, Professor\\"). In the twenty-sixth episode, it is revealed that Ken's mother works on a space station, therefore making her very busy and unable to be with Ken. Thanks to the girls and Santa Claus (whom he believed did not exist at first based on a 70% possibility), he was able to see her and is now able to communicate with her clearly on the lab's monitor. In episode 37, when the Powerpuff Girls Z are \\"grounded\\" from using their powers for a day when they have to take a test in school, Ken fills in for them, donning a superhero suit consisting of a black bodysuit, a white cape, white gloves, white boots, a red vest with gold shoulder pads and a yellow \\"Z\\" on it, and a blue helmet with the yellow letters \\"KK\\" on it, while brandishing a blue polearm with a yellow \\"U\\" at the end, and calling himself \\"Kamikaze Ken Z\\". Despite having no powers or attacks, he uses traps and other props as weapons when he defends their lab from the Gangreen Gang, ultimately driving them off by tricking them into drinking bottles of hot sauce (thinking they were the containers of Chemical Z). Ken's pre-production art bears a strong resemblance to Dexter from Dexter's Laboratory, even the current incarnation. However, in one of the special edition booklets, it is explained the design originated from Kid Utonium from the original series. : :Peach is Ken's pet robot dog who was also affected by a white Chemical Z ray, gaining the ability to talk, as well as a considerable boost in intelligence. Peach's shout prompts the girls to transform either in person or through a long-distance communication device, although a modification to the girls' compacts allows them to transform on their own. Additionally, Peach can re- summon the girls' powers, even when their powers are drained. Peach is also capable of sniffing out those who are affected by the black rays, white rays, and Him's black particles. The black ray monsters/villains that have been sniffed by Peach are stored in his data banks for later reference. This ability, however, is hindered if his target is wearing heavy cosmetics (as was the case with Sedusa). Peach is also capable of sniffing and identifying others more clearly than other dogs, even when someone's appearance has been completely changed. ; : :The mayor of New Townsville (Tokyo City), whose design is distinctly different from his American counterpart, as he is of normal height and has no monocle or top hat. While less extreme in comparison to the Mayor of Townsville, the Mayor is very childish and has a very short attention span. He seems to worry quite a lot when the girls are fighting, and wishes that they could cause a little less damage. The Mayor, like many of the characters in the anime, loves sweets. The Mayor also has a younger brother, who is the Principal of the school. It was through him that Miss Bellum and the Mayor were able rearrange the classes, so that the girls would be in the same class. However, the Mayor and the Principal, don't always get along, and even the most minor of things will set off an argument, which often time leads to name calling. He also deals with his brother when the girls aren't doing well in class due to them skipping class to save the city. ; : :Mayor Mayer's assistant, who has blonde hair compared to the original's red hair. Usually, Sara Bellum covers her face with a tablet computer, which has lipstick imprinted on it. While the mayor is different from his original counterpart and is more competent, Sara Bellum in the anime still does most of the mayor's work for him in a manner similar to the original Sara Bellum, and still appears to be the brains of the operation. ; : :The girls' teacher who is very pretty and loved by her male students, although the female students don't like her as much, especially Princess Morbucks. Miss Keane, like the original, is kind and incredibly patient. =Family members= ; : :Momoko's eight-year-old sister, and she is just as hyper and addicted to the sentai/hero genre as her older sister. She is very independent and likes to pretend she is a heroine. She admires the Powerpuff Girls Z and wishes to be a heroine just like them. She admires Rolling Bubbles and Powered Buttercup, but shows little favor for Hyper Blossom who, unbeknownst to her, is actually her own sister. She is also always looking for new ways to annoy her sister. She appears to be quite interested in Ken, especially when she realizes that he knows her sister. Similarly, Ken seems interested in her because of her resemblance to Blossom. ; : :Miyako' grandmother, who she lives with in a large traditional-looking house. She is gentle sounding and usually gets distracted by nostalgic things, but she can also be strict when it comes to manners. You also never see her eyes ever open, as they are always closed to portray a happy feeling. She is a traditional Japanese woman. ; : :Kaoru's father, a professional wrestler and loving family man who is never seen without his mask. He left for Mexico when Kaoru was young, and studied the art of the luchador after experiencing a losing streak that could have cost him his career. His teacher was severely injured in what is implied to be his final match. The Masked Mexico was given his teacher's mask, which in true lucha spirit, he never removes, except when taking a shower. Since then, Kaoru has forgotten what her father's face looks like. There is no photograph in their family album that shows what his real face looks like either, mirroring Miss Bellum's running gag. After he wins the match against Giant Panda Mask, Kaoru finally got to see her father's face for the first time since before he left for Mexico, which is reportedly 'very handsome. ; : :Kaoru's mother. She is a very good cook and is exceptionally gentle in contrast to her husband and kids. She also likes to smile a lot. ; : :Kaoru's older brother. ; : :Kaoru's younger brother. ; : :Three girls, , and , who protected Edo from Him, as revealed in the thirty episode, Edo eventually became Tokyo City. A long time ago in Edo, when Him was terrorizing its citizens, a man named Kennai Hiraga, who is modeled after Hiraga Gennai, created the special substance \\"Chemical X\\". Hiraga poured it on three girls: Momo, Omiya, and Okou. The substance changed their appearance, giving them new hairstyles, now similar to their present day counterparts and kimonos which the bottom portion is shorter than normal, resembling mini skirts, the colors match the Powerpuff Girls Z, and their sashes are black with the symbols of the Powerpuff Girls Z, as well as their own powers and weapons. The three faced and successfully defeated Him, whose weakness to the cold became his undoing. Together with Hiraga, they were able to drain Him's powers and seal his body in a coffin. The Great Edo ChakiChaki Girls can be seen as the heroines who preceded the present day Powerpuff Girls Z and may in fact be their ancestors. Because of his defeat, Him has a deep hatred towards the Great Edo ChakiChaki Girls and directs that hatred towards the Powerpuff Girls Z for their resemblance to them. Similarly to the Steamypuff Girls from the original Powerpuff Girls cartoon, they both stopped a great villain from a previous era. ; :A character who appears exclusively in the manga version. A popular kid in school who Momoko has a heavy crush on, though he finds her constantly annoying, despite being admiring her alter ego, Blossom. Villains =Returning villains= ; : :An ordinary zoo monkey who was made fun of by people and decided to seek revenge on humanity after the ray from Chemical Z made him intelligent. He is physically more powerful than the original version of the character, able to fly and lay a dozen punches at one time. This version of Mojo frequently displays an immature attitude and makes the most childish flaws throughout his plans. While the original Mojo was portrayed as one of the most competent and genuinely threatening villains in the series, the anime version is more of a rather inept comic relief and is seen by the Powerpuff Girls Z as more of an annoying nuisance than a dangerous enemy. The anime Mojo also does not repeat himself redundantly as the original Mojo does, he ends most of his sentences with saying his name. He is the same size as the original, as the giant cape conceals his small figure. ; : :Him is the most powerful enemy of the series, and it is safe to say that he is the main antagonist. Him is a demon saved, nothing more and nothing less than chaos itself. His biggest weakness is the cold. In ancient times, Him was dedicated to bring about the destruction of a small town, however, was defeated by the Great Edo ChakiChaki Girls who took advantage of Him's weakness which is cold or snow to lock him up and take part of their evil and save the mountains. But when Ken ended up destroying one of the icebergs in the bay of New Townsville, black lights were scattered all around New Townsville consequently, over producing and giving birth to the many villains in the city and a black light struck Him and woke him. It is also known that he releases a strange dust that was responsible for producing some villains. ; : :In Powerpuff Girls Z, it is unknown who or what he was before being hit by the black light. Fuzzy looks almost exactly the same as his original counterpart: a large pink creature in overalls. This rendition of Fuzzy is as rude and destructive as the original, but is nice enough to help an old man or sign an autograph for a fan who likes his banjo playing, that is before going on a rampage. Like Mojo Jojo, he ends most of his sentences with \\"de mon da\\". He has a crush on Ms. Bellum. ; : :Himeko is a bratty rich kid in the girls' class who is hit by the black light. Her powers are used based on her wants to be recognized by people. Once she is back to normal however, she does not recall any events that occurred while she was evil. She has a strong dislike for Momoko, Miyako and Kaoru, trying to get them into trouble even when she is not evil. She does, however, have some odd feeling of friendship toward them that she displays from time to time. She has an older sister named Miko, who does everything better than her, and even draws attention by their parents. However, while she is somewhat jealous of Miko, she loves her sister very much and is always excited when she visits. Unlike the original cartoon series, both of her parents' faces are shown and her mother is alive and around. She has a cat named Sapphire, whose scream causes Himeko' transformation turning to Princess. ; : :A nasty group of trouble makers, made up of , , , and . ; : :A group of amoeba brought to life by the black light. Their members are , and , who is actually a girl. ; / : :Sakurako is a shy girl who runs a candy store. She has a crush on a boy named , and it is her jealousy towards him that leads her to be hit by the black lights, transforming her into Sedusa whenever she puts on some lipstick. As Sedusa, Sakurako can wear makeup to make herself look like anyone, as well as use her hair like tentacles, traits shared with her American counterpart, but unlike her American counterpart, Annie, as well as Sedusa, is in love with Souichiro, a regular client of her shop, rather than Professor Utonium. ; : :, and are created by Mojo based on the DNA found on the girls' personal items. These items form the basis of the Rowdyruff's weapons. Brick's weapon is actually Hyper Blossom's heart twisty straw, which he shoots spits fireballs at the girls, Boomer's weapon is Rolling Bubbles' used cotton bud used his own ear wax at opponents and Butch's weapon is Powred Buttercup's smelly gym sock which he would throw like a boomerang. =Original villains= ; : :Michel-(also known by his alter ego Gigi the Great) is an effeminate hairdresser with strange tastes in hair. He has a teddy bear that when wound up, compliments Michel and tells him that he's great. The teddy bear gets hit by the black light and grants Michel powers of hypnosis to make the customers to accept his eccentric hairstyle. The cause of his transformation is hearing compliments from the teddy bear, and to prevent any further transformations, Ken and the Powerpuff Girls Z replace the old recording on the teddy bear with a new one that insults Michel. ; : :Himeko's older sister who always likes to stand out, which is often the cause of grief for her younger sister, although the two do care for each other. When she gets jealous of the Powerpuff Girls' fame, she has a suit developed that temporarily gives her powers exceeding the girls, naming her Shirogane Z in order to upstage them. ; : ; and :A pair of androids who appear as the main antagonists in the manga adaptation. They were created by a pair of scientists to act as their children, but were stolen by a group of thieves who reprogrammed them to take revenge on humanity before being hit by the black lights.

It lies 520 km east of Darwin and 120 km west of Nhulunbuy. Description The bay is about 40 km long and 16 km wide. It is aligned from south-west where the Buckingham River enters, to north-east where it opens into the Arafura Sea. It is largely bordered by intertidal mudflats, with patches of mangroves along the lower reaches of the Buckingham River. The saline flats back on to a seasonally inundated floodplain. There are scattered patches of dry coastal vine thicket along the margins of the floodplain. The bay and adjoining plains are held by the Arnhem Land Aboriginal Land Trust as Aboriginal freehold land. The nearest communities are Galiwin'ku on Elcho Island 15 km to the north-west, and Gapuwiyak some 25 km to the south.Sites of Conservation Significance: Buckingham Bay. =Birds= The bay's intertidal mudflats and seasonally flooded coastal plains have been classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). The area covered by the IBA is 32,642 ha.Birdata. The bay is especially significant for the migratory waders, or shorebirds, that breed in northern Asia and Alaska during the northern summer and spend the non-breeding season in Australia. Up to about 20,000 wades have been recorded on the bay's mud and saline flats. Species for which count data indicate the site's global significance include black-tailed godwit (6000), eastern curlew (700), and great knot (5000). Up to 8500 waterbirds have been recorded using the bay, with numbers of pied herons being globally significant. A waterbird breeding colony in the mangroves near the mouth of the Buckingham River contained 5500 birds in 1999, predominantly pied herons and intermediate egrets. Other birds for which the site is significant are brolgas and magpie geese. =Other animals= Introduced water buffalos and feral pigs threaten the wetlands.

It is not closely related to other languages and appears to form its own branch of the Niger‚ÄìCongo family, although it was formerly classified as an Atlantic language. Dialects include Tonko, Sela, Kamuke (or Ke), Wara-wara, Keleng, Biriwa, and Safroko. The eastern variety, spoken primarily in Guinea, is quite distinct. Limba has a system of noun classes, marked by an old, eroded set of prefixes augmented by a newer set of enclitics. Distribution Ethnologue lists the following two varieties of Limba, spoken in Guinea and Sierra Leone. East Limba is spoken in Our√©-Kaba, Guinea. West-Central Limba is spoken in northern Sierra Leone. It is spoken in the Little Scarcies River area in east Bombali District and northeast Kambia District, as well as north of Makeni. Phonology Like neighboring Temne, Limba has an unusual contrast among its consonants. It distinguishes dental and alveolar, but the dental consonants are apical and the alveolar consonants are laminal, the opposite of the general pattern. Grammar =Noun classes= Noun classes are distinguished by the form of the definite article (class particle) which follows the noun, and sometimes also by a prefix. Roughly, the following classes can be deduced from the examples given by Mary Lane Clarke:Mary Lane Clarke, A Limba‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, or, Tampe≈à ta ka Talu≈à ta ka Hulimba ha in Hui≈àkilisi ha, Houghton, New York, 1922, reprinted 1971 by Gregg International Publishers, Farnborough, England.

IRWD headquarters are located in Irvine, California. IRWD offers the following services: potable water sales, sewer service and sale of reclaimed (or recycled) water and serves the city of Irvine and portions of Costa Mesa, Lake Forest, Newport Beach, Orange, Tustin and unincorporated areas of Orange County. IRWD has more than 101,000 connections with more than 300,000 customers spanning over of service area in Orange County.

Swan was reelected to the Board without opposition in 2006 and 2010.  District facilities & water supply  IRWD's drinking water comes from two primary sources: local groundwater and imported water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. The blending of these sources varies according to the time of year and the geographic location within the District. In addition, IRWD has an extensive recycled water program that is used for irrigation or other non-potable purposes. The District's diversified supply ensures a reliable water supply during times of drought, regulatory constraints and other emergencies. A diverse water supply portfolio helps to keep IRWD rates as low as possible. =Groundwater= Approximately 48 percent of IRWD's overall supply comes from local groundwater wells in the Orange County Groundwater Basin, and the Irvine and Lake Forest sub-basins. For many years, IRWD received almost all of its water from imported sources. To alleviate this dependency on expensive imported water, IRWD began to develop a series of local wells in 1979. The Dyer Road Wellfield Project extracts low-cost, high-quality water from deep within the Orange County Groundwater Basin. IRWD now operates 25 groundwater wells within its service area. =Imported Water= Approximately 20 percent of IRWD‚Äôs water is purchased through the Municipal Water District of Orange County from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a regional water wholesaler that delivers imported water from Northern California and the Colorado River. =State Water Project= The State Water Project, also known as the California Aqueduct, transports water from Northern California to the southern portion of the state. It is owned and operated by the State of California and is the longest aqueduct system in the world, featuring 23 dams and reservoirs, 22 pumping plants that lift water to heights of , and six power plants. The aqueduct consists of of canals, of pipeline and of tunnels. =Colorado River Project= The Colorado River Aqueduct brings water from the Colorado River through deserts and over mountain ranges to its terminal reservoir, Lake Mathews, in Riverside County. The aqueduct system includes five pumping plants that lift the water . =Recycled Water= IRWD produces approximately 21 percent of its supply by treating wastewater and reusing it for irrigation and other non-potable, or non-drinking, uses. The primary uses of recycled water are agricultural and landscape irrigation including parks, school grounds, golf courses, freeway landscaping and irrigation of common areas managed by homeowner associations. Recycled water is also used for front and backyard irrigation in large residential lots, for industrial processes, and for toilet flushing and cooling towers in dozens of dual-plumbed office buildings. The color of recycled water pipes, known worldwide as Irvine Purple, originated at IRWD. =Urban Runoff= The California Water Code Section 35539.12 grants IRWD the authority to provide urban runoff treatment services within the District. Urban runoff is the excess water that carries pollutants into storm drains and then to the ocean. Residents who live miles inland can contribute to ocean pollution simply by leaving their sprinklers on too long. After this wasted water flows to the curb it carries trash, fertilizers, pet waste and other pollutants into the storm drain system which flows into San Diego Creek, eventually ending up in ecologically sensitive Upper Newport Bay and the Pacific ocean. Urban runoff can be prevented by implementing efficient irrigation practices. Additionally, an urban runoff treatment system, like the IRWD Natural Treatment System program, helps protect the San Diego Creek Watershed by naturally removing some of the contaminants in from urban runoff before it reaches the ocean.  Water Rates  IRWD has some of the lowest water rates in Orange County, California. The district uses an allocation-based conservation rate structure. Under this system, each customer receives a basic allocation of water that provides a reasonable amount of water for customer needs and property characteristics, including the number of occupants, lot size, size of irrigated area, climate, etc. A customer's cost of water is based upon how much water a customer uses (measured by reading the customers meter) and whether or not the customer stayed within his or her allocation. If a customer's water usage exceeds his or her monthly allocation, their cost of water will increase due to the need for IRWD to purchase more expensive sources of water, such as imported water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. In an attempt to ensure equity among its customers, the IRWD separates the cost of building water and sewer infrastructure from the cost of daily operations and maintenance. Infrastructure costs, called capital projects, are financed through general obligation bonds, the debt service for these is paid through a combination of property taxes and connection fees. Daily operation and maintenance costs, which are further separated between the water and sewer systems, are funded through monthly user service charges. The IRWD's basic principle behind these precise allocations of cost is that each end-user pays his fair share, no more and no less.  District Finances & Investments  IRWD uses a long-range planning approach that eliminates the need for dramatic increases in customer rates to pay for new infrastructure (pipes, pumps, reservoirs, etc.) or for the inevitable repair and the replacement of these types of facilities as they begin to age. =Financial Reports= Public agencies such as IRWD do not issue a traditional annual report, but rather a much fuller report called a Comprehensive Annual Financial Report or CAFR. The report highlights major projects and initiatives in addition to financial data. The CAFR has been the annual financial report of choice for public agencies since it was established in 1945 by the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA). Reports submitted to the CAFR program are reviewed by selected members of the GFOA professional staff and the GFOA Special Review Committee (SRC), which comprises individuals with expertise in public-sector financial reporting and includes financial statement preparers, independent auditors, academics, and other finance professionals. IRWD's CAFR has received a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in each year a CAFR was prepared. This award recognizes governments whose CAFRs achieve the highest standards in government accounting and financial reporting. =Operating Budget= Each year the IRWD Board of Directors approves an annual operating budget at a public meeting for the fiscal year which runs from July 1 through June 30 of each year. The IRWD Operating Budget provides the financial plan required to implement the District's workplan for the year.

Franco \\"Bifo\\" Berardi (born 2 November 1949) is an Italian communist philosopher, theorist and activist in the autonomist tradition, whose work mainly focuses on the role of the media and information technology within post-industrial capitalism. Berardi has written over two dozen published books, as well as a number of essays and speeches.  Creative work and activism  In 1962, at the age of 13, Berardi became a member of the Italian Communist Youth Federation, but was expelled due to \\"factionalism.\\" He participated in the events of May '68 at the University of Bologna, where he graduated with a degree in Aesthetics. During this time he joined the extra-parliamentary Worker's Power group and met Antonio Negri. Berardi founded the magazine A/traverso in 1975 and worked with the magazine until 1981, when it reached its high point of publishing. He was also part of the staff of Radio Alice, the first free pirate radio station in Italy, from 1976 to 1978. Like others involved in the political movement of Autonomia in Italy during the 1970s, Berardi fled to Paris, where he worked with F√©lix Guattari in the field of schizoanalysis. During the 1980s, Berardi contributed to the magazines Semiotexte (New York), Chimerees (Paris), Metropoli (Rome) and Musica 80 (Milan). During the 1990s, he published Mutazione e Ciberpunk (Genoa, 1993), Cibernauti (Rome, 1994), and F√©lix (Rome, 2001). He has also collaborated with artists such as Warren Neidich and publications such as e-flux in the contemporary arts field. Currently he is working with the magazine Derive Approdi as well as teaching social history of communication at the Accademia di belle Arti in Milan. He is the co-founder of the e-zine rekombinant.org and of the telestreet movement, founding the channel Orfeo TV.Biography at Generation-Online. Theories Unlike orthodox Marxists, Berardi's autonomist theories draw on psychoanalysis, schizoanalysis and communication theory to show how subjectivity and desire are bound up with the functioning of the capitalism system, rather than portraying events such as the financial crisis of 2008 merely as an example of the inherently contradictory logic of capitalist accumulation.Berardi, Franco. The Soul at Work: From Alienation to Autonomy. Trans. Francesca Cadel and Giuseppina Mecchia, with preface by Jason E. Smith. Los Angeles, CA: Semiotexte, 2009. Thus, he argues against privileging labour in critique and says that \\"the solution to the economic difficulty of the situation cannot be solved with economic means: the solution is not economic.\\"Berardi, Franco. . Lithuania: Alytus Art Strike Biennial, 2009. Human emotions and embodied communication becomes increasingly central to the production and consumption patterns that sustain capital flows in post-industrial society, and as such Berardi uses the concepts of \\"cognitariat\\" and \\"info labour\\" to analyze this psycho-social process.\\"Info Labour and Precarity\\". Trans. Eric Empson.Il sapiente, il mercante, il guerriero: dal rifiuto del lavoro all'emergere del cognitariato. Untranslated: The Warrior, The Merchant, and the Sage: the Emergence of the Cognitariat Refusal of Work. Rome: DeriveApprodi, 2004. Among Berardi's other concerns are cultural representations and expectations about the future ‚Äî from proto-Fascist Futurism\\"Futurism and the reversal of the future\\". London: May 2009. to post-modern cyberpunk (1993). This represents a greater concern with ideas and cultural expectations than the determinist-materialist expression of a Marxism which is often confined to purely economic or systemic analysis. The Uprising and Breathing Two of Berardi's books, The Uprising and Breathing, are closely related speculative works which treat the global financial crisis, financial capitalism and the subsequent protest movements of the early 21st century such as Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring. In both works Berardi criticizes neoliberal financial capitalism, claiming that its supporting infrastructure of automation (e.g. computer trading on the stock market)‚Äîtogether with standardized computer language conventions on social media (e.g. the like button on Facebook)‚Äîhollow out language to the detriment of human actors who naturally communicate in more sensuous and subjective ways. As remedies Berardi suggests poetry and \\"chaos\\"‚Äîciting the elegies of Rilke and Guattari's work on chaos‚Äîas methods for human subjects to overcome the lived experience of market logic. Additionally both books cite the work of Deleuze and Guattari, Marx's Fragment on Machines from the Grundrisse, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus by Wittgenstein, and Symbolic Exchange and Death by Baudrillard. =The Uprising= In The Uprising Berardi rejects economic discourse, asserting that economics itself is not a science but rather a form of political ideology. Consequently he further rejects the notion that neoliberal economic policy is based in the objectivity of science, but is instead merely a political program and an undesirable one. Against the mathematical language of economics (which he alleges masquerades as scientific) Berardi opposes a speculative (and also unscientific) rhetoric of poetry, which he intends to disrupt the conventional wisdom of contemporary economics. Berardi decries the automation and standardization of language via computer technology, which he alleges results in an impoverished language as experienced by the human subject, with the result that it is more difficult to conceptualize another form of life apart from the current economic/political situation. He also criticizes the fragmentation of precarious work (e.g. seasonal work, telecommuting) which leads to social atomization and precludes social solidarity, and further rejects neoliberal and conservative economic views.The Uprising, pp. 44-48. As remedies, Berardi proposes both a rediscovery of poetic language which speaks directly to humans, and also a redirection of the general intellect‚Äîa Marxist term deriving from the Grundrisse, referring to the cognitive capacity of society‚Äîaway from capitalism and towards social solidarity. =Breathing= In Breathing, Berardi uses respiration as a metaphor to discuss modern society. Beginning with his own asthma and the death of Eric Garner,Breathing, p. 15. he advances the notion that humanity is experiencing a \\"breathlessness\\"Breathing, p. 10. in all areas of life as a result of being out of sync with contemporary capitalism and technology. The book continues several of the themes previously treated in The Uprising. Berardi cites Chaosmosis, a text by F√©lix Guattari, to establish a dichotomy of rhythm and chaos. This dichotomy is then compared with (regular and irregular) breathing and the alleged tension between humans and capitalist society. The rhetorical suggestion is that humanity is obliged to \\"shake off\\" capitalism in a spasm which will allow the social body to \\"breathe regularly\\" again, in a new rhythm.Breathing, p. 50. Later, Berardi examines other alleged social ills of the early 21st century. He cites the novels of Jonathan Franzen as providing \\"insight into what is happening to the American mind, and particularly to the American unconscious, during the reign of Trump... the living brain of America is decaying, seized by anxiety and depression, furiously looking for scapegoats and for revenge.\\"Breathing, pp. 74-75. Berardi criticizes the virtual reality of dating apps (juxtaposed with reports of decreased sexual activity among millennials)Breathing, pp. 96-103. and internet forum posts by the American hacker and troll weevBreathing, pp. 135-136. as further examples of sickness in society. As proposed remedies, Berardi returns to poetry and the notion of seeking different rhythms of life.

It is a complex based on a 10-acre former chicken farm with three recording studios, a guest lounge, office building, and guest house facility. The studio is a turnkey destination with facilities for tracking, mixing, and mastering. History Prairie Sun co-owner, Mark \\"Mooka\\" Rennick, is a musician (bass player, primarily) who toured with Commander Cody's Billy C. Farlow in the late 1970s. After trying to balance life as a touring musician with that of a studio owner/producer, he left the road for his - at that time - garage-style studio near Sonoma State University, which is what initially brought him to the area from his native Illinois. \\"I started with the Beach Boys' 'Clover' mixing desk and a 1-inch 8-track machine,\\" recalls Rennick. \\"Then I got a 2-inch 16-track, and by 1979 I had bought a 24-track 2-inch machine from Wally Heider's Studio when they went out of business. So, 'Boom,' I'm in the studio business - because I had the hardware. In 1981, Mooka teamed up with chicken-ranch owner Clifton Buck- Kauffman and relocated Prairie Sun to his 12-acre farm. The studio became known as a residential recording facility, combining vintage analogue devices with the modern digital recording technology. The studio evolved to become a complete audio destination: living areas, rehearsal space for pre-production, tracking/overdubbing rooms, and mixing/mastering suites. The sole permanent resident of Prairie Sun is studio cat Bubba Feats. Recording artists Artists that Prairie Sun has recorded include: Tom Waits, John Hammond Jr., AFI, ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, Primus, RacerX,Groundation, The Mountain Goats, Steel Train, UFO, Rob Wasserman, Norton Buffalo, Neko Case, Booker T.

It is part of the Stardust series of games developed by the Finnish company Housemarque. The game was announced at Sony's E3 press conference in 2011 and a video trailer was released. Gameplay Using the PlayStation Vita's dual analog sticks, players control a starship orbiting a planet. The planet's orbit acts as the playfield, filled with asteroids and enemies for the player to destroy. In the main arcade mode there are 5 planets, consisting of 5 phases each. At the end of each planet the player encounters a boss. The ship has several different weapons, smart bombs, a temporary shield, and a speed boost system. The ship has two projectile weapons of opposite polarities (Ice and Fire) that can be switched between on-the-fly. While one is effective against a certain type of enemy, it can be almost useless against another so players must quickly adapt to situations, constantly choosing which weapon to use against what. Each weapon can be powered-up over the course of the game by collecting tokens (dropped onto orbit from destroyed enemy craft/asteroids). The ship is also able to collect and deploy smart bombs, which usually clear most of the playfield. When deploying a smart bomb players can choose the desired effect: Black Hole, Missile Strike, or EMP bomb. The PlayStation Vita's touchscreen controls Missile Strike, rear touch opens Black Hole, and motion control (shaking) deploys the EMP Bomb. Other unique features of Super Stardust Delta are that the view can be tilted to see around the planet, and the ship's speed boost system has a slo-mo feature that enables players to navigate the ship with more precision while boosting. Super Stardust Delta also has more game modes than any of the preceding titles in the series - 11 unique modes all in all, each with its own unique challenges and scenarios. The different game modes are \\"Arcade\\", \\"Planets\\", \\"Endless\\", \\"Bomber\\", \\"Impact\\", \\"Twin-Gun\\", \\"Crush!\\", \\"Disc Slide\\", \\"Orbit Bomber\\", \\"Rock & Roll\\", and \\"Trucker\\". The main game modes have three difficulty levels to choose from; \\"Casual\\", \\"Normal\\", or \\"Hardcore\\". Many of the game modes let players choose whether to play the game with the \\"Delta\\" or \\"Pure\\" control configuration. The \\"Delta\\" configuration allows gameplay with new features, with players using the touchscreen, motion controls, as well as button controls to play the game, enabling the Black Hole and Missile Strike smart bombs, as well as the speed boost getting the slo-mo feature. The \\"Pure\\" configuration features simple button controls only, doing away with the Black Hole, Missile Strike and the speed boost's slo-mo feature. Super Stardust Delta has global leaderboards via PlayStation Network. =Downloadable content= The \\"Blast Pack\\" was available on launch day on the PlayStation Network. It gives players four new game modes. \\"Endless\\" provides ever-increasing waves of enemies and asteroids. \\"Bomber\\" tests how long players can survive when armed only with bombs. \\"Impact\\" tests how long players can keep their boost up; boosting through objects increases the boost meter. And in \\"Twin-Gun\\" mode the player's ship two cannons which can be controlled simultaneously using the control sticks while motion controls are used for steering. Development The problems to overcome during the development of the game were basically two: rendering performance on GPU and simulation on CPU. Managing those two problems allowed the game to run steadily at 60 fps. To deal with the rendering, Housemarque optimized the shaders to be as light as possible, and came up with quite creative solutions for some effects. For example, the Black Hole effect was embedded in the same pixel shader as the rendering for the \\"game grid\\" (planet orbit/playfield), so the pixel power from the GPU could be utilized more efficiently. To solve the CPU challenge, Housemarque made a totally new custom gameplay architecture, and all gameplay code was made to run multithreaded, utilizing a fiber based system to switch the active simulation tasks and make sure that all cores were fully utilized. Separating the rendering and gameplay this way, means that in Super Stardust Delta most CPU cores are calculating the collisions/frame updates for the whole frame duration. Soundtrack The game has four soundtracks - three of which are made by Ari Pulkkinen, who also provided the soundtracks for Super Stardust HD and Super Stardust Portable. The soundtracks are \\"Delta\\" (the new PlayStation Vita soundtrack), \\"Arcade\\" (original Super Stardust HD soundtrack), \\"Orchestral\\" (a DLC soundtrack for Super Stardust HD), and \\"Retro\\" (old retro music from Stardust games of the 90's - composed by Risto Vuori). New tracks for the Arcade and Orchestral soundtrack are unlocked each time the game is started. The Retro soundtrack required the Near app and is no longer unlockable after its closure in 2017. Reception The game received \\"favourable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

Rightful resistance is contrasted with other forms of popular protest where citizens challenge the legitimacy of rulers; the rightful resister accepts the legitimacy of laws, policies and core values of the state, but protests when they perceive that authorities have failed to deliver on their own promises, or have defied the laws or widely accepted values. Rightful resisters are characterized by the peaceful nature of their protests, which often make use of institutionalized channels of dissent. Unlike more conventional resisters who may employ covert or quiet means of sabotage against the state, rightful resisters actively seek the attention of the elites, and their protests are public and open.Kevin J. O'Brien, \\"Rightful Resistance,\\" World Politics Journal, Volume 49, Number 1, October 1996. The concept was first explained by the political scientist Kevin O'Brien in the 1996 article Rightful Resistance, which focused on its applications in rural China, as well as in a variety of other political settings, including the United States and South Africa. The concept was elaborated on in O'Brien and Lianjiang Li's 2006 book Rightful Resistance in Rural China,Kevin J. O'Brien and Li Lianjiang, \\"Rightful Resistance in Rural China.\\" Cambridge University Press, 2006. and has been adopted by a number of other social change theorists to describe the methods by which citizens may gradually seek to advance their rights and interests. Example of Rightful Resistance =China= The concept of rightful resistance devised by O'Brien was initially used to describe protest actions adopted in rural China, where citizens confront a range of grievances stemming from official corruption, environmental pollution, predatory taxes, and economic misappropriation, among others. As the \\"rights consciousness\\" of Chinese citizens grew in the era of Deng Xiaoping and onward, citizens began making use of petitioning channels, the legal system, and of central government directives to hold local-level authorities to account. To illustrate, O'Brien provides the example of a group of villagers in Henan province facing excessive taxes from local authorities. In response, the villages presented authorities with a copy of central government regulations which prescribed strict limits of taxes, and threatened that if the local authorities failed to drop the excessive taxes, they would take their complaints up the ladder.O'Brien (1996) Rightful resistance in China is manifest in a variety of other ways, include use of the petitioning system, village elections, and legal system to seek redress against grievances. Weiquan (rights defending) lawyers, who regularly defy authorities by defending individuals whose human or civil rights have been violated by the party-state, have been described as engaging in a form of rightful resistance.Eva Pils, \\"The practice of law as conscientious resistance: Chinese weiquan lawyers' experience,\\" in Impact of China's 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, Jean-Philippe Beja (ed) (Routledge, 2011) Weiquan lawyers typically frame their arguments by making appeals to China's constitution, arguing that abuses of human rights‚Äîsanctioned as they may be by the state‚Äîare in contravention of the country's laws.Keith J. Hand. \\"Using Law for a Righteous Purpose: The Sun Zhigang Incident and Evolving Forms of Citizen Action in the People's Republic of China.\\" Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, Issue 45 (2006), pp. 114-147.

It roughly divides Davenport to the west and Bettendorf to the east. The Interstate Highway begins at an interchange with Interstate 80 (I-80) at the northeastern edge of Davenport and continues into Illinois at the Mississippi River by crossing the I-74 Bridge. The freeway was built in stages during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The northern half of the interstate was built atop farmland in northeastern Davenport, while the southern half was built near the existing U.S. Route 6 (US 6) corridor through Bettendorf. After the approaches to the Iowa-Illinois Memorial Bridge were rebuilt for interstate traffic, it was completed and opened to traffic on November 26, 1974. The Iowa and Illinois departments of transportation are planning a major reconstruction project along I-74. The corridor will be widened from four lanes to six. A new river crossing will be built to replace the aging bridges. Eastbound motorists on I-80 wishing to use I-74 east of the Quad Cities are suggested to use I-80 east around town for this reason. Route description I-74 begins at a trumpet interchange with I-80 on the northern edge of Davenport where it heads to the south. From I-80 to the East 67th Street overpass, the freeway is surrounded by farmland on either side. South of the overpass, it passes a residential area to the east and a commercial area to the west. The East 53rd Street exit provides access to shopping centers on both sides of the interstate. Continuing south between East 53rd Street and Spruce Hills Drive, I-74 goes through an area of sparse development. What businesses there are have frontages on either Elmore Avenue to the west or Utica Ridge Road to the east; the backs of these businesses abut the freeway. At the Spruce Hills Drive exit, U.S. Route 6 (US 6) joins from the west. Nearly to the west, Spruce Hills Drive becomes Kimberly Road, which carries US 6 through Davenport until it intersects I-280 on the western edge of the Quad Cities. South of Spruce Hills Drive, I-74 runs parallel to the eastern leg of Kimberly Road, which turned south at its intersection with Spruce Hills Drive. The freeway curves slightly to the southeast and enters Bettendorf. It crosses Duck Creek and meets Middle Road at a diamond interchange. As I-74 and US 6 head down a hill towards the Mississippi River, a series of exit and entrance ramps connect the freeway to US 67, which runs northbound along State Street and southbound along Grant Street. The interstate passes over US 67 and railroad tracks belonging to the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad on an elevated highway, which serves as the approach to the Interstate 74 Bridge over the Mississippi River. Despite the singular name, the crossing is actually two twin bridges which each carry one direction of traffic to and from Moline, Illinois. History An interstate bisecting the Quad Cities was planned as early as 1955 I-74 was part of the original plans for building Iowa's interstate system. It would form the Iowa leg of a planned freeway from the Quad Cities to Cincinnati, Ohio. Its route through the Quad Cities closely resembles the path drawn up in the mid-1950s. In the Iowa Quad Cities, I-74 opened in three segments beginning on August 30, 1968. On that day, the northernmost , from I-80 to US 6, opened to traffic. The new freeway was built atop farmland west of Utica Ridge Road in the northeastern part of Davenport. The next section was built adjacent to the north‚Äìsouth portion of Kimberly Road, which then carried US 6 through Bettendorf. The segment ended where the interstate lined up with the older street. The eastbound exit and westbound entrance ramps at Kimberly Road now provide access to and from US 67\\\\. The middle section opened in 1971. Another three years passed before the freeway was completed and opened to traffic. The twin spans of the I-74 Bridge had to be retrofitted to connect to the interstate. The Iowa-bound bridge was built as a Works Progress Administration project in 1934‚Äì35 and the Illinois-bound bridge was 24 years later. Prior to interstate construction, the I-74 Bridge terminated at State Street, the northbound lanes of US 67, in Bettendorf. To prevent traffic bottlenecks, traffic was prohibited from making left turns onto and off of the bridges. As a result, loop ramps diverted traffic onto Gilbert Street, one block south of State Street, which curved back to State Street at both ends thus allowing traffic to make the necessary left turns. Construction of the interstate meant eliminating the at-grade intersections with State and Grant streets. I-74 was built as elevated highway from the bridges to a new overpass at Kimberly Road. The connections were completed and opened to traffic on November 26, 1974. Future The Iowa and Illinois departments of transportation are in the planning stages to build a new bridge to replace the aging I-74 Bridge. The Iowa-bound bridge opened in 1935; the Illinois bridge in 1958. In addition to replacing the bridges, the scope of the bi-state coalition's plan includes updating of I-74 mainline and interchanges from 53rd Street in Davenport to the Avenue of the Cities in Moline. In 2005, the Iowa and Illinois DOTs identified the traffic needs of the corridor and found they would be satisfied by a true-arch, tied-arch, or cable-stayed bridge. After public input and consideration of construction costs and aesthetics, the departments of transportation, in August 2006, recommended building two twin, true arch, basket handle bridges. U.S. Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois has suggested charging a toll upon motorists who use the new bridges to help pay for their construction. However, a 1998 study, which researched all river crossing options to replace the bridges, deemed new tolls were not viable. In addition to the new river crossing, the mainline of I-74 between 53rd Street in Davenport and the Avenue of the Cities in Moline will be widened from a four-lane freeway to six lanes. Additional lanes will be picked up and dropped in selected locations. The new bridge itself will be eight lanes, with entrance ramps at US 67 becoming a lane on the Illinois bound bridge, and then exiting at River Drive in Moline. On the Iowa bound span, River Drive entrance ramps in Moline will create a new lane across the bridge, exiting at US 67. In downtown Bettendorf, the connection to US 67 will be simplified. US 67 traffic will be routed in both directions along Grant Street. State and Grant streets are currently a one-way couplet through Bettendorf. A network of ramps and city streets form the interchange as it is now. A full-access interchange will be built in its place at Grant Street. Construction along the corridor has already been completed at the 53rd Street interchange. A partial cloverleaf interchange was being added in each direction to allow traffic to enter I-74 without making left turns at its intersection with 53rd Street. This phase of construction ended around December 2012.

It premiered at the 2009 Melbourne International Film Festival.  Development  Blind Company is adapted from Austin Pendleton's stage production Uncle Bob. Nick Barkla who plays Josh in Blind Company met Austin Pendleton while studying acting at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company, an ensemble-based film company of actors, writers and directors. Barkla won the 2007 AFI fellowship of $20,000 to observe their collaborative method of working ‚Äì an approach that led directly to the making of this film. When Barkla returned to Australia he produced the play and acted in it for Red Stitch Theatre Company. Director Alkinos Tsilimidos saw the production in Melbourne and became interested in writing the adaptation. Tsilimidos had worked with both Nick Barkla and Colin Friels on previous films, such as Tom White and Em4Jay. Tsilimidos states his interest in the film is due to its exploration of people \\"who have given up on the world\\". Plot Geoff Brewster is seeing out his final days at the family's isolated coastal shack - walking the beach and leaving tape-recorded confessions for his estranged wife, Sally. Geoff, we learn, is dying, and will soon begin to lose his sight. But the peace of the coastal shack is shattered when his nephew, Josh (Nick Barkla, Em 4 Jay) arrives at the house, volatile and apparently hostile, at the wheel of a Porsche, announcing that he has come to stay. It's not clear at first why he has come or what he wants from Geoff. But his presence will spark a deadly game between both men that will threaten to destroy them both.https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/blind- company-20100428-tscr.html#ixzz1OYxv5bpf  Production  Blind Company was shot in Bicheno, Tasmania in September 2008.

Excessive risk-taking by banks combined with the bursting of the United States housing bubble caused the values of securities tied to U.S. real estate to plummet, damaging financial institutions globally, culminating with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, and an international banking crisis. The crisis sparked the Great Recession, which, at the time, was the most severe global recession since the Great Depression. It was also followed by the European debt crisis, which began with a deficit in Greece in late 2009, and the 2008‚Äì2011 Icelandic financial crisis, which involved the bank failure of all three of the major banks in Iceland and, relative to the size of its economy, was the largest economic collapse suffered by any country in economic history. U.S. home mortgage debt relative to GDP increased from an average of 46% during the 1990s to 73% during 2008, reaching $10.5 trillion. The increase in cash out refinancings, as home values rose, fueled an increase in consumption that could no longer be sustained when home prices declined. Many financial institutions owned investments whose value was based on home mortgages such as mortgage-backed securities, or credit derivatives used to insure them against failure, which declined in value significantly. The International Monetary Fund estimated that large U.S. and European banks lost more than $1 trillion on toxic assets and from bad loans from January 2007 to September 2009. Lack of investor confidence in bank solvency and declines in credit availability led to plummeting stock and commodity prices in late 2008 and early 2009. The crisis rapidly spread into a global economic shock, resulting in several bank failures. Economies worldwide slowed during this period since credit tightened and international trade declined. Housing markets suffered and unemployment soared, resulting in evictions and foreclosures. Several businesses failed. From its peak in the second quarter of 2007 at $64.4 trillion, household wealth in the United States fell $14 trillion, to $50.4 trillion by the end of the first quarter of 2009, resulting in a decline in consumption, then a decline in business investment. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the quarter- over-quarter decline in real GDP in the U.S. was 8.4%. The U.S. unemployment rate peaked at 10.0% in October 2009, the highest rate since 1983 and roughly twice the pre-crisis rate. The average hours per work week declined to 33, the lowest level since the government began collecting the data in 1964. The economic crisis started in the U.S. but spread to the rest of the world. U.S. consumption accounted for more than a third of the growth in global consumption between 2000 and 2007 and the rest of the world depended on the U.S. consumer as a source of demand. Toxic securities were owned by corporate and institutional investors globally. Derivatives such as credit default swaps also increased the linkage between large financial institutions. The de- leveraging of financial institutions, as assets were sold to pay back obligations that could not be refinanced in frozen credit markets, further accelerated the solvency crisis and caused a decrease in international trade. Reductions in the growth rates of developing countries were due to falls in trade, commodity prices, investment and remittances sent from migrant workers. This led to a dramatic rise in the number of households living below the poverty line. States with fragile political systems feared that investors from Western states would withdraw their money because of the crisis. As part of national fiscal policy response to the Great Recession, governments and central banks, including the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England provided then-unprecedented trillions of dollars in bailouts and stimulus, including expansive fiscal policy and monetary policy to offset the decline in consumption and lending capacity, avoid a further collapse, encourage lending, restore faith in the integral commercial paper markets, avoid the risk of a deflationary spiral, and provide banks with enough funds to allow customers to make withdrawals. In effect, the central banks went from being the \\"lender of last resort\\" to the \\"lender of only resort\\" for a significant portion of the economy. In some cases the Fed was considered the \\"buyer of last resort\\". During the fourth quarter of 2008, these central banks purchased US$2.5 trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks. This was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market, and the largest monetary policy action in world history. Following a model initiated by the 2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package, the governments of European nations and the United States guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems, ultimately purchasing $1.5 trillion newly issued preferred stock in major banks. The Federal Reserve created then-significant amounts of new currency as a method to combat the liquidity trap. Bailouts came in the form of trillions of dollars of loans, asset purchases, guarantees, and direct spending. Significant controversy accompanied the bailouts, such as in the case of the AIG bonus payments controversy, leading to the development of a variety of \\"decision making frameworks\\", to help balance competing policy interests during times of financial crisis. Alistair Darling, the U.K.'s Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the crisis, stated in 2018 that Britain came within hours of \\"a breakdown of law and order\\" the day that Royal Bank of Scotland was bailed-out. Instead of financing more domestic loans, some banks instead spent some of the stimulus money in more profitable areas such as investing in emerging markets and foreign currencies. In July 2010, the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted in the United States to \\"promote the financial stability of the United States\\". The Basel III capital and liquidity standards were adopted worldwide. Since the 2008 financial crisis, consumer regulators in America have more closely supervised sellers of credit cards and home mortgages in order to deter anticompetitive practices that led to the crisis.'''''' At least two major reports on the causes of the crisis were produced by the U.S. Congress: the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission report, released January 2011, and a report by the United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations entitled Wall Street and the Financial Crisis: Anatomy of a Financial Collapse, released April 2011. In total, 47 bankers served jail time as a result of the crisis, over half of which were from Iceland, where the crisis was the most severe and led to the collapse of all 3 of the major Icelandic banks. In April 2012, Geir Haarde of Iceland became the only politician to be convicted as a result of the crisis. Only one banker in the United States served jail time as a result of the crisis, Kareem Serageldin, a banker at Credit Suisse who was sentenced to 30 months in jail and returned $25.6 million in compensation for manipulating bond prices to hide $1 billion of losses. No individuals in the United Kingdom were convicted as a result of the crisis. Goldman Sachs paid $550 million to settle fraud charges after allegedly anticipating the crisis and selling toxic investments to its clients. With fewer resources to risk in creative destruction, the number of patent applications was flat, compared exponential increases in patent application in prior years. US inequality from 1913 to 2008. Typical American families did not fare well, nor did those \\"wealthy-but-not-wealthiest\\" families just beneath the pyramid's top. However, half of the poorest families did not have wealth declines at all during the crisis because they generally did not own financial investments whose value fluctuates. The Federal Reserve surveyed 4,000 households between 2007 and 2009, and found that the total wealth of 63% of all Americans declined in that period and 77% of the richest families had a decrease in total wealth, while only 50% of those on the bottom of the pyramid suffered a decrease. History People queuing outside a Northern Rock branch in the United Kingdom to withdraw their savings during the financial crisis. =Timeline= Following is a timeline of major events during the financial crisis, including government responses, and the subsequent economic recovery: * 2006: After years of above-average price increases, housing prices peaked and mortgage loan delinquency rose, leading to the United States housing bubble. Due to lax underwriting standards, one- third of all mortgages in 2006 were low or no-documentation loans (stated income loans) or subprime loans, which were 17-20% of loan originations. * February 27, 2007: Stock prices in China and the U.S. fell by the most since 2003 as reports of a decline in home prices and durable goods orders stoked growth fears, with Alan Greenspan predicting a recession. Due to increased delinquency rates in subprime lending, Freddie Mac said it will stop investing in certain subprime loans. * April 2, 2007: New Century, an American real estate investment trust specializing in Subprime lending and securitization, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This propagated the subprime mortgage crisis. * June 20, 2007: After receiving margin calls, Bear Stearns bailed out 2 of its hedge funds with $20 billion of exposure to collateralized debt obligations including subprime mortgages.

A week earlier, the stock was trading at $60/share and a year earlier it traded for $178/share. The buyout price was increased to $10/share the following week. * March 18, 2008: In a contentious meeting, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, its 6th cut in 6 months.

Lehman had been in talks to be sold to either Bank of America or Barclays but neither bank wanted to acquire the entire company. * September 16, 2008: The Federal Reserve took over American International Group with $85 billion in debt and equity funding. The Reserve Primary Fund \\"broke the buck\\" as a result its exposure to Lehman Brothers securities. * September 17, 2008: Investors withdrew $144 billion from U.S. money market funds, the equivalent of a bank run on money market funds, which frequently invest in commercial paper issued by corporations to fund their operations and payrolls, causing the short-term lending market to freeze. The withdrawal compared to $7.1 billion in withdrawals the week prior. This interrupted the ability of corporations to rollover their short-term debt. The U.S. government extended insurance for money market accounts analogous to bank deposit insurance via a temporary guarantee and with Federal Reserve programs to purchase commercial paper. * September 18, 2008: In a dramatic meeting, United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson and Chair of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke met with Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and warned that the credit markets were close to a complete meltdown.

The Volcker Rule against proprietary trading was not part of the legislation. * July 21, 2010: Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted. * September 12, 2010: European regulators introduced Basel III regulations for banks, which increased capital ratios, limits on leverage, narrowed the definition of capital to exclude subordinated debt, limited counter-party risk, and added liquidity requirements. Critics argued that Basel III didn't address the problem of faulty risk-weightings. Major banks suffered losses from AAA-rated created by financial engineering (which creates apparently risk-free assets out of high risk collateral) that required less capital according to Basel II. Lending to AA-rated sovereigns has a risk-weight of zero, thus increasing lending to governments and leading to the next crisis. Johan Norberg argued that regulations (Basel III among others) have indeed led to excessive lending to risky governments (see European sovereign-debt crisis) and the European Central Bank pursues even more lending as the solution. * November 3, 2010: To improve economic growth, the Federal Reserve announced another round of quantitative easing, dubbed QE2, which included the purchase of $600 billion in long-term Treasuries over the following eight months. * March 2011: Two years after the nadir of the crisis, many stock market indices were 75% above their lows set in March 2009.

Income inequality in the United States grew from 2005 to 2012 in more than 2 out of 3 metropolitan areas. * June 2015: A study commissioned by the ACLU found that white home-owning households recovered from the financial crisis faster than black home-owning households, widening the racial wealth gap in the U.S. * 2017: Per the International Monetary Fund, from 2007 to 2017, \\"advanced\\" economies accounted for only 26.5% of global GDP (PPP) growth while emerging and developing economies accounted for 73.5% of global GDP (PPP) growth. In the table, the names of emerging and developing economies are shown in boldface type, while the names of developed economies are in Roman (regular) type. Causes While the causes of the bubble are disputed, the precipitating factor for the Financial Crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 was the bursting of the United States housing bubble and the subsequent subprime mortgage crisis, which occurred due to a high default rate and resulting foreclosures of mortgage loans, particularly adjustable- rate mortgages. Some or all of the following factors contributed to the crisis: * Lax underwriting standards and high mortgage approval rates led to an increase in the number of homebuyers, which drove up housing prices. This appreciation in value led many homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes as an apparent windfall, leading to over-leveraging. * The high delinquency and default rates by homeowners, particularly those with subprime credit, led to a rapid devaluation of mortgage-backed securities including bundled loan portfolios, derivatives and credit default swaps. As the value of these assets plummeted, buyers for these securities evaporated and banks who were heavily invested in these assets began to experience a liquidity crisis. * Securitization allowed for shifting of risk and lax underwriting standards: Many mortgages were bundled together and formed into new financial instruments called mortgage-backed securities, in a process known as securitization. These bundles could be sold as (ostensibly) low-risk securities partly because they were often backed by credit default swaps insurance. Because mortgage lenders could pass these mortgages (and the associated risks) on in this way, they could and did adopt loose underwriting criteria (due in part to outdated and lax regulation). * Lax regulation allowed predatory lending in the private sector, especially after the federal government overrode anti-predatory state laws in 2004. * The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), a 1977 U.S. federal law designed to help low- and moderate-income Americans get mortgage loans encouraged banks to grant mortgages to higher risk families. * Reckless lending by lenders such as Bank of America's Countrywide Financial unit, caused Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to lose market share and to respond by lowering their own standards. * Mortgage guarantees by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, quasi-government agencies, which purchased many subprime loan securitizations. The implicit guarantee by the U.S. federal government created a moral hazard and contributed to a glut of risky lending. * Government policies that encouraged home ownership, providing easier access to loans for subprime borrowers; overvaluation of bundled subprime mortgages based on the theory that housing prices would continue to escalate; questionable trading practices on behalf of both buyers and sellers; compensation structures by banks and mortgage originators that prioritize short-term deal flow over long- term value creation; and a lack of adequate capital holdings from banks and insurance companies to back the financial commitments they were making. * The Wall Street and the Financial Crisis: Anatomy of a Financial Collapse (Levin‚ÄìCoburn Report) by the United States Senate concluded that the crisis was the result of \\"high risk, complex financial products; undisclosed conflicts of interest; the failure of regulators, the credit rating agencies, and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street\\". * In its January 2011 report, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by: ** \\"widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision\\", including the Federal Reserve's failure to stem the tide of Toxic assets; ** \\"dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions\\" including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk; ** \\"a combination of excessive borrowing, risky investments, and lack of transparency\\" by financial institutions and by households that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis; ** ill preparation and inconsistent action by government and key policy makers lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw that \\"added to the uncertainty and panic\\" ** a \\"systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics\\" at all levels. ** \\"collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline\\" ** deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives, especially credit default swaps ** \\"the failures of credit rating agencies\\" to correctly price risk * The 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which partially repealed the Glass-Steagall Act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the United States and increased speculation on the part of depository banks. * Credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the financial risk involved with mortgage loan-related financial products, and governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address changes in financial markets.Strategische Unternehmensfuehrung Nr. 1, 1999. Munich, St. Gallen 1999, * Variations in the cost of borrowing. * Fair value accounting was issued as U.S. accounting standard SFAS 157 in 2006 by the privately run Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)‚Äîdelegated by the SEC with the task of establishing financial reporting standards. This required that tradable assets such as mortgage securities be valued according to their current market value rather than their historic cost or some future expected value. When the market for such securities became volatile and collapsed, the resulting loss of value had a major financial effect upon the institutions holding them even if they had no immediate plans to sell them. * Easy availability of credit in the US, fueled by large inflows of foreign funds after the 1998 Russian financial crisis and 1997 Asian financial crisis of the 1997‚Äì1998 period, led to a housing construction boom and facilitated debt-financed consumer spending. As banks began to give out more loans to potential home owners, housing prices began to rise. Lax lending standards and rising real estate prices also contributed to the real estate bubble. Loans of various types (e.g., mortgage, credit card, and auto) were easy to obtain and consumers assumed an unprecedented debt load. * As part of the housing and credit booms, the number of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO), which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices, greatly increased. Such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors to invest in the U.S. housing market. As housing prices declined, these investors reported significant losses. * Falling prices also resulted in homes worth less than the mortgage loans, providing borrowers with a financial incentive to enter foreclosure. Foreclosure levels were elevated until early 2014. drained significant wealth from consumers, losing up to $4.2 trillion Defaults and losses on other loan types also increased significantly as the crisis expanded from the housing market to other parts of the economy. Total losses were estimated in the trillions of U.S. dollars globally. * Financialization - the increased use of leverage in the financial system. * U.S. government policy from the 1970s onward emphasized deregulation to encourage business, which resulted in less oversight of activities and less disclosure of information about new activities undertaken by banks and other evolving financial institutions. Thus, policymakers did not immediately recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as investment banks and hedge funds, also known as the shadow banking system. Some experts believe these institutions had become as important as commercial (depository) banks in providing credit to the U.S. economy, but they were not subject to the same regulations. These institutions, as well as certain regulated banks, had also assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large loan defaults or losses. These losses affected the ability of financial institutions to lend, slowing economic activity. =Subprime lending= US subprime lending expanded dramatically 2004‚Äì2006 The relaxing of credit lending standards by investment banks and commercial banks allowed for a significant increase in subprime lending. Subprime did not become magically less risky; Wall Street just accepted this higher risk. Due to competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share, and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited, mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers. In the view of some analysts, the relatively conservative government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003. However, as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined GSE power, mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated. The riskiest loans were originated in 2004‚Äì2007, the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the GSEs. The GSEs eventually relaxed their standards to try to catch up with the private banks. A contrarian view is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac led the way to relaxed underwriting standards, starting in 1995, by advocating the use of easy-to-qualify automated underwriting and appraisal systems, by designing the no-down-payment products issued by lenders, by the promotion of thousands of small mortgage brokers, and by their close relationship to subprime loan aggregators such as Countrywide. Depending on how \\"subprime\\" mortgages are defined, they remained below 10% of all mortgage originations until 2004, when they rose to nearly 20% and remained there through the 2005‚Äì2006 peak of the United States housing bubble. Role of affordable housing programs The majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, written by the six Democratic appointees, the minority report, written by three of the four Republican appointees, studies by Federal Reserve economists, and the work of several independent scholars generally contend that government affordable housing policy was not the primary cause of the financial crisis. Although they concede that governmental policies had some role in causing the crisis, they contend that GSE loans performed better than loans securitized by private investment banks, and performed better than some loans originated by institutions that held loans in their own portfolios. In his dissent to the majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, conservative American Enterprise Institute fellow Peter J. Wallison stated his belief that the roots of the financial crisis can be traced directly and primarily to affordable housing policies initiated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the 1990s and to massive risky loan purchases by government-sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Based upon information in the SEC's December 2011 securities fraud case against six former executives of Fannie and Freddie, Peter Wallison and Edward Pinto estimated that, in 2008, Fannie and Freddie held 13 million substandard loans totaling over $2 trillion. In the early and mid-2000s, the Bush administration called numerous times for investigations into the safety and soundness of the GSEs and their swelling portfolio of subprime mortgages. On September 10, 2003, the United States House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing at the urging of the administration to assess safety and soundness issues and to review a recent report by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) that had uncovered accounting discrepancies within the two entities. The hearings never resulted in new legislation or formal investigation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as many of the committee members refused to accept the report and instead rebuked OFHEO for their attempt at regulation. Some, such as conservative Peter J. Wallison, believe this was an early warning to the systemic risk that the growing market in subprime mortgages posed to the U.S. financial system that went unheeded. A 2000 United States Department of the Treasury study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that $467 billion of mortgage lending was made by Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)-covered lenders into low and mid level income (LMI) borrowers and neighborhoods, representing 10% of all U.S. mortgage lending during the period. The majority of these were prime loans. Sub-prime loans made by CRA-covered institutions constituted a 3% market share of LMI loans in 1998, but in the run-up to the crisis, fully 25% of all subprime lending occurred at CRA-covered institutions and another 25% of subprime loans had some connection with CRA. However, most sub-prime loans were not made to the LMI borrowers targeted by the CRA, especially in the years 2005‚Äì2006 leading up to the crisis, nor did it find any evidence that lending under the CRA rules increased delinquency rates or that the CRA indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub-prime lending. To other analysts the delay between CRA rule changes in 1995 and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising, and does not exonerate the CRA. They contend that there were two, connected causes to the crisis: the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place. Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling $4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007. They also argue that the Federal Reserve's classification of CRA loans as \\"prime\\" is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that high-interest-rate loans (3 percentage points over average) equal \\"subprime\\" loans. Others have pointed out that there were not enough of these loans made to cause a crisis of this magnitude. In an article in Portfolio Magazine, Michael Lewis spoke with one trader who noted that \\"There weren't enough Americans with [bad] credit taking out [bad loans] to satisfy investors' appetite for the end product.\\" Essentially, investment banks and hedge funds used financial innovation to enable large wagers to be made, far beyond the actual value of the underlying mortgage loans, using derivatives called credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations and synthetic CDOs. By March 2011, the FDIC had paid out $9 billion to cover losses on bad loans at 165 failed financial institutions. The Congressional Budget Office estimated, in June 2011, that the bailout to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac exceeds $300 billion (calculated by adding the fair value deficits of the entities to the direct bailout funds at the time). Economist Paul Krugman argued in January 2010 that the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles and the global nature of the crisis undermines the case made by those who argue that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, CRA, or predatory lending were primary causes of the crisis. In other words, bubbles in both markets developed even though only the residential market was affected by these potential causes. Countering Krugman, Peter J. Wallison wrote: \\"It is not true that every bubble‚Äîeven a large bubble‚Äîhas the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates.\\" Wallison notes that other developed countries had \\"large bubbles during the 1997‚Äì2007 period\\" but \\"the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the United States when the 1997‚Äì2007 [bubble] deflated.\\" According to Wallison, the reason the U.S. residential housing bubble (as opposed to other types of bubbles) led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loans‚Äîgenerally with low or no downpayments. Krugman's contention (that the growth of a commercial real estate bubble indicates that U.S. housing policy was not the cause of the crisis) is challenged by additional analysis. After researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis, Xudong An and Anthony B. Sanders reported (in December 2010): \\"We find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in CMBS [commercial mortgage-backed securities] loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis.\\" Other analysts support the contention that the crisis in commercial real estate and related lending took place after the crisis in residential real estate. Business journalist Kimberly Amadeo reported: \\"The first signs of decline in residential real estate occurred in 2006. Three years later, commercial real estate started feeling the effects. Denice A. Gierach, a real estate attorney and CPA, wrote: > ... most of the commercial real estate loans were good loans destroyed by a > really bad economy. In other words, the borrowers did not cause the loans to > go bad-it was the economy. =Growth of the housing bubble= A graph showing the median and average sales prices of new homes sold in the United States between 1963 and 2016 (not adjusted for inflation) Between 1998 and 2006, the price of the typical American house increased by 124%. In contrast, during the 1980s and 1990s, the national median home price ranged from 2.9 to 3.1 times median household income. This ratio increased to 4.0 in 2004, and 4.6 in 2006. This housing bubble resulted in many homeowners refinancing their homes at lower interest rates, or financing consumer spending by taking out second mortgages secured by the price appreciation. In a Peabody Award winning program, NPR correspondents argued that a \\"Giant Pool of Money\\" (represented by $70 trillion in worldwide fixed income investments) sought higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds early in the decade. This pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast. Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with products such as the mortgage-backed security and the collateralized debt obligation that were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies. In effect, Wall Street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the US, with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain, from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers and the large investment banks behind them. By approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted, and continued strong demand began to drive down lending standards. The collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending, extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees. This essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority. Those securities first in line received investment-grade ratings from rating agencies. Securities with lower priority had lower credit ratings but theoretically a higher rate of return on the amount invested. By September 2008, average U.S. housing prices had declined by over 20% from their mid-2006 peak. As prices declined, borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages could not refinance to avoid the higher payments associated with rising interest rates and began to default. During 2007, lenders began foreclosure proceedings on nearly 1.3 million properties, a 79% increase over 2006. This increased to 2.3 million in 2008, an 81% increase vs. 2007. By August 2008, approximately 9% of all U.S. mortgages outstanding were either delinquent or in foreclosure. By September 2009, this had risen to 14.4%. After the bubble burst, Australian economist John Quiggin wrote, \\"And, unlike the Great Depression, this crisis was entirely the product of financial markets. There was nothing like the postwar turmoil of the 1920s, the struggles over gold convertibility and reparations, or the Smoot-Hawley tariff, all of which have shared the blame for the Great Depression.\\" Instead, Quiggin lays the blame for the 2008 near- meltdown on financial markets, on political decisions to lightly regulate them, and on rating agencies which had self-interested incentives to give good ratings. =Easy credit conditions= Lower interest rates encouraged borrowing. From 2000 to 2003, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate target from 6.5% to 1.0%. This was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the dot-com bubble and the September 11 attacks, as well as to combat a perceived risk of deflation. As early as 2002, it was apparent that credit was fueling housing instead of business investment as some economists went so far as to advocate that the Fed \\"needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble\\". Moreover, empirical studies using data from advanced countries show that excessive credit growth contributed greatly to the severity of the crisis. US current account deficit. Additional downward pressure on interest rates was created by the high and rising U.S. current account deficit, which peaked along with the housing bubble in 2006. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke explained how trade deficits required the U.S. to borrow money from abroad, in the process bidding up bond prices and lowering interest rates. Bernanke explained that between 1996 and 2004, the U.S. current account deficit increased by $650 billion, from 1.5% to 5.8% of GDP. Financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad, much of it from countries running trade surpluses. These were mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations. The balance of payments identity requires that a country (such as the US) running a current account deficit also have a capital account (investment) surplus of the same amount. Hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds (capital) flowed into the U.S. to finance its imports. All of this created demand for various types of financial assets, raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates. Foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates (as high as 40% in China) or because of high oil prices. Ben Bernanke referred to this as a \\"saving glut\\". A flood of funds (capital or liquidity) reached the U.S. financial markets. Foreign governments supplied funds by purchasing Treasury bonds and thus avoided much of the direct effect of the crisis. U.S. households, used funds borrowed from foreigners to finance consumption or to bid up the prices of housing and financial assets. Financial institutions invested foreign funds in mortgage- backed securities. The Fed then raised the Fed funds rate significantly between July 2004 and July 2006. This contributed to an increase in 1-year and 5-year adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) rates, making ARM interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners. This may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble, as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates, and it became riskier to speculate in housing. U.S. housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst. =Weak and fraudulent underwriting practices= Subprime lending standards declined in the U.S.: in early 2000, a subprime borrower had a FICO score of 660 or less. By 2005, many lenders dropped the required FICO score to 620, making it much easier to qualify for prime loans and making subprime lending a riskier business. Proof of income and assets were de-emphasized. Loans at first required full documentation, then low documentation, then no documentation. One subprime mortgage product that gained wide acceptance was the no income, no job, no asset verification required (NINJA) mortgage. Informally, these loans were aptly referred to as \\"liar loans\\" because they encouraged borrowers to be less than honest in the loan application process. Testimony given to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission by whistleblower Richard M. Bowen III, on events during his tenure as the Business Chief Underwriter for Correspondent Lending in the Consumer Lending Group for Citigroup, where he was responsible for over 220 professional underwriters, suggests that by 2006 and 2007, the collapse of mortgage underwriting standards was endemic. His testimony stated that by 2006, 60% of mortgages purchased by Citigroup from some 1,600 mortgage companies were \\"defective\\" (were not underwritten to policy, or did not contain all policy-required documents)‚Äîthis, despite the fact that each of these 1,600 originators was contractually responsible (certified via representations and warrantees) that its mortgage originations met Citigroup standards. Moreover, during 2007, \\"defective mortgages (from mortgage originators contractually bound to perform underwriting to Citi's standards) increased ... to over 80% of production\\". In separate testimony to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, officers of Clayton Holdings, the largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance company in the United States and Europe, testified that Clayton's review of over 900,000 mortgages issued from January 2006 to June 2007 revealed that scarcely 54% of the loans met their originators' underwriting standards. The analysis (conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks, including 7 \\"too big to fail\\" banks) additionally showed that 28% of the sampled loans did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer. Clayton's analysis further showed that 39% of these loans (i.e. those not meeting any issuer's minimal underwriting standards) were subsequently securitized and sold to investors. =Predatory lending= Predatory lending refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders, enticing borrowers to enter into \\"unsafe\\" or \\"unsound\\" secured loans for inappropriate purposes. In June 2008, Countrywide Financial was sued by then California Attorney General Jerry Brown for \\"unfair business practices\\" and \\"false advertising\\", alleging that Countrywide used \\"deceptive tactics to push homeowners into complicated, risky, and expensive loans so that the company could sell as many loans as possible to third-party investors\\". In May 2009, Bank of America modified 64,000 Countrywide loans as a result. When housing prices decreased, homeowners in ARMs then had little incentive to pay their monthly payments, since their home equity had disappeared. This caused Countrywide's financial condition to deteriorate, ultimately resulting in a decision by the Office of Thrift Supervision to seize the lender. One Countrywide employee‚Äîwho would later plead guilty to two counts of wire fraud and spent 18 months in prison‚Äîstated that, \\"If you had a pulse, we gave you a loan.\\" Former employees from Ameriquest, which was United States' leading wholesale lender, described a system in which they were pushed to falsify mortgage documents and then sell the mortgages to Wall Street banks eager to make fast profits. There is growing evidence that such mortgage frauds may be a cause of the crisis. =Deregulation and lack of regulation = A 2012 OECD study suggest that bank regulation based on the Basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced the financial crisis. In other cases, laws were changed or enforcement weakened in parts of the financial system. Key examples include: * Jimmy Carter's Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (DIDMCA) phased out several restrictions on banks' financial practices, broadened their lending powers, allowed credit unions and savings and loans to offer checkable deposits, and raised the deposit insurance limit from $40,000 to $100,000 (thereby potentially lessening depositor scrutiny of lenders' risk management policies). * In October 1982, U.S. President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Garn‚ÄìSt. Germain Depository Institutions Act, which provided for adjustable- rate mortgage loans, began the process of banking deregulation, and contributed to the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s/early 1990s. (further references: ) * In November 1999, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed into law the Gramm‚ÄìLeach‚ÄìBliley Act, which repealed provisions of the Glass- Steagall Act that prohibited a bank holding company from owning other financial companies. The repeal effectively removed the separation that previously existed between Wall Street investment banks and depository banks, providing a government stamp of approval for a universal risk-taking banking model. Investment banks such as Lehman became competitors with commercial banks. Some analysts say that this repeal directly contributed to the severity of the crisis, while others downplay its impact since the institutions that were greatly affected did not fall under the jurisdiction of the act itself. * In 2004, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission relaxed the net capital rule, which enabled investment banks to substantially increase the level of debt they were taking on, fueling the growth in mortgage-backed securities supporting subprime mortgages. The SEC conceded that self-regulation of investment banks contributed to the crisis. * Financial institutions in the shadow banking system are not subject to the same regulation as depository banks, allowing them to assume additional debt obligations relative to their financial cushion or capital base. This was the case despite the Long-Term Capital Management debacle in 1998, in which a highly leveraged shadow institution failed with systemic implications and was bailed out. * Regulators and accounting standard-setters allowed depository banks such as Citigroup to move significant amounts of assets and liabilities off-balance sheet into complex legal entities called structured investment vehicles, masking the weakness of the capital base of the firm or degree of leverage or risk taken. Bloomberg News estimated that the top four U.S. banks will have to return between $500 billion and $1 trillion to their balance sheets during 2009. This increased uncertainty during the crisis regarding the financial position of the major banks. Off-balance sheet entities were also used in the Enron scandal, which brought down Enron in 2001.Healy, Paul M. & Palepu, Krishna G.: \\"The Fall of Enron\\" ‚Äì Journal of Economics Perspectives, Volume 17, Number 2. (Spring 2003), p. 13 * As early as 1997, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan fought to keep the derivatives market unregulated. With the advice of the Working Group on Financial Markets, the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton allowed the self-regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market when they enacted the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. Written by Congress with lobbying from the financial industry, it banned the further regulation of the derivatives market. Derivatives such as credit default swaps (CDS) can be used to hedge or speculate against particular credit risks without necessarily owning the underlying debt instruments. The volume of CDS outstanding increased 100-fold from 1998 to 2008, with estimates of the debt covered by CDS contracts, as of November 2008, ranging from US$33 to $47 trillion. Total over-the-counter (OTC) derivative notional value rose to $683 trillion by June 2008. Warren Buffett famously referred to derivatives as \\"financial weapons of mass destruction\\" in early 2003. A 2011 paper suggested that Canada's avoidance of a banking crisis in 2008 (as well as in prior eras) could be attributed to Canada possessing a single, powerful, overarching regulator, while the United States had a weak, crisis prone and fragmented banking system with multiple competing regulatory bodies. =Increased debt burden or overleveraging= Leverage ratios of investment banks increased significantly between 2003 and 2007. Household debt relative to disposable income and GDP. Prior to the crisis, financial institutions became highly leveraged, increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses. Much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as off-balance sheet securitization and derivatives, which made it difficult for creditors and regulators to monitor and try to reduce financial institution risk levels. U.S. households and financial institutions became increasingly indebted or overleveraged during the years preceding the crisis. This increased their vulnerability to the collapse of the housing bubble and worsened the ensuing economic downturn. Key statistics include: Free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from $627 billion in 2001 to $1,428 billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built, a total of nearly $5 trillion over the period, contributing to economic growth worldwide. U.S. home mortgage debt relative to GDP increased from an average of 46% during the 1990s to 73% during 2008, reaching $10.5 trillion. U.S. household debt as a percentage of annual disposable personal income was 127% at the end of 2007, versus 77% in 1990. In 1981, U.S. private debt was 123% of GDP; by the third quarter of 2008, it was 290%. From 2004 to 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage, which increased their vulnerability to a financial shock. Changes in capital requirements, intended to keep U.S. banks competitive with their European counterparts, allowed lower risk weightings for AAA-rated securities. The shift from first-loss tranches to AAA-rated tranches was seen by regulators as a risk reduction that compensated the higher leverage. These five institutions reported over $4.1 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007, about 30% of U.S. nominal GDP for 2007. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and was liquidated, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became commercial banks, subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation. With the exception of Lehman, these companies required or received government support. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, owned or guaranteed nearly $5trillion in mortgage obligations at the time they were placed into conservatorship by the U.S. government in September 2008. These seven entities were highly leveraged and had $9 trillion in debt or guarantee obligations; yet they were not subject to the same regulation as depository banks. Behavior that may be optimal for an individual such as saving more during adverse economic conditions, can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior, as ultimately one person's consumption is another person's income. Too many consumers attempting to save or pay down debt simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist Hyman Minsky also described a \\"paradox of deleveraging\\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets. In April 2009, Federal Reserve vice- chair Janet Yellen discussed these paradoxes: > Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn't take long before we were in a > recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and > employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, > we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more > than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly > every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, > especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are > cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, > financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve > their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood > this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions > that may be smart for individuals and firms‚Äîand indeed essential to return > the economy to a normal state‚Äînevertheless magnify the distress of the > economy as a whole. =Financial innovation and complexity= IMF Diagram of CDO and RMBS The term financial innovation refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives, such as offsetting a particular risk exposure (such as the default of a borrower) or to assist with obtaining financing. Examples pertinent to this crisis included: the adjustable-rate mortgage; the bundling of subprime mortgages into mortgage- backed securities (MBS) or collateralized debt obligations (CDO) for sale to investors, a type of securitization; and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps (CDS). The usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis. These products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions. CDO issuance grew from an estimated $20 billion in Q1 2004 to its peak of over $180 billion by Q1 2007, then declined back under $20 billion by Q1 2008. Further, the credit quality of CDO's declined from 2000 to 2007, as the level of subprime and other non-prime mortgage debt increased from 5% to 36% of CDO assets. As described in the section on subprime lending, the CDS and portfolio of CDS called synthetic CDO enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding, provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found. For example, buying a CDS to insure a CDO ended up giving the seller the same risk as if they owned the CDO, when those CDO's became worthless. Diagram of CMLTI 2006 ‚Äì NC2 This boom in innovative financial products went hand in hand with more complexity. It multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage (including mortgage brokers, specialized originators, the securitizers and their due diligence firms, managing agents and trading desks, and finally investors, insurances and providers of repo funding). With increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information (including FICO scores on creditworthiness, appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations, and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks). Instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts, misjudgments and finally market collapse. Economists have studied the crisis as an instance of cascades in financial networks, where institutions' instability destabilized other institutions and led to knock-on effects. Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, wrote in June 2009 that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations, such as off-balance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks, stating: \\"... an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade‚Äîthe off-balance-sheet vehicles, the derivatives and the 'shadow banking system' itself‚Äîwas to find a way round regulation.\\" =Incorrect pricing of risk= A protester on Wall Street in the wake of the AIG bonus payments controversy is interviewed by news media. Mortgage risks were underestimated by almost all institutions in the chain from originator to investor by underweighting the possibility of falling housing prices based on historical trends of the past 50 years. Limitations of default and prepayment models, the heart of pricing models, led to overvaluation of mortgage and asset-backed products and their derivatives by originators, securitizers, broker-dealers, rating-agencies, insurance underwriters and the vast majority of investors (with the exception of certain hedge funds). While financial derivatives and structured products helped partition and shift risk between financial participants, it was the underestimation of falling housing prices and the resultant losses that led to aggregate risk. The pricing of risk refers to the risk premium required by investors for taking on additional risk, which may be measured by higher interest rates or fees. Several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis, enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have, and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward, readily understandable format. For a variety of reasons, market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as MBS and CDOs or understand its effect on the overall stability of the financial system. The pricing model for CDOs clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system. Banks estimated that $450 billion of CDO were sold between \\"late 2005 to the middle of 2007\\"; among the $102 billion of those that had been liquidated, JPMorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for \\"high quality\\" CDOs was approximately 32 cents on the dollar, while the recovery rate for mezzanine capital CDO was approximately five cents for every dollar. AIG insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps. The basic CDS transaction involved AIG receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party A in the event party B defaulted. However, AIG did not have the financial strength to support its many CDS commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in September 2008. U.S. taxpayers provided over $180 billion in government loans and investments in AIG during 2008 and early 2009, through which the money flowed to various counterparties to CDS transactions, including many large global financial institutions. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) made the major government study of the crisis. It concluded in January 2011: > The Commission concludes AIG failed and was rescued by the government > primarily because its enormous sales of credit default swaps were made > without putting up the initial collateral, setting aside capital reserves, > or hedging its exposure‚Äîa profound failure in corporate governance, > particularly its risk management practices. AIG's failure was possible > because of the sweeping deregulation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, > including credit default swaps, which effectively eliminated federal and > state regulation of these products, including capital and margin > requirements that would have lessened the likelihood of AIG's failure. The limitations of a widely used financial model also were not properly understood. This formula assumed that the price of CDS was correlated with and could predict the correct price of mortgage-backed securities. Because it was highly tractable, it rapidly came to be used by a huge percentage of CDO and CDS investors, issuers, and rating agencies. According to one wired.com article: As financial assets became more complex and harder to value, investors were reassured by the fact that the international bond rating agencies and bank regulators accepted as valid some complex mathematical models that showed the risks were much smaller than they actually were. George Soros commented that \\"The super-boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves. Similarly, the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the originators of synthetic products. It was a shocking abdication of responsibility.\\" A conflict of interest between investment management professional and institutional investors, combined with a global glut in investment capital, led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets. Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management. There is, therefore, an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many asset managers continued to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments, to the detriment of their clients, so they could maintain their assets under management. They supported this choice with a \\"plausible deniability\\" of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early \\"vintages\\" of subprime loans was so low. Despite the dominance of the above formula, there are documented attempts of the financial industry, occurring before the crisis, to address the formula limitations, specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events. The volume \\"Credit Correlation: Life After Copulas\\", published in 2007 by World Scientific, summarizes a 2006 conference held by Merrill Lynch in London where several practitioners attempted to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations. See also the article by Donnelly and Embrechts and the book by Brigo, Pallavicini and Torresetti, that reports relevant warnings and research on CDOs appeared in 2006. =Boom and collapse of the shadow banking system= Securitization markets were impaired during the crisis There is strong evidence that the riskiest, worst performing mortgages were funded through the \\"shadow banking system\\" and that competition from the shadow banking system may have pressured more traditional institutions to lower their underwriting standards and originate riskier loans. In a June 2008 speech, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Timothy Geithner‚Äîwho in 2009 became United States Secretary of the Treasury‚Äîplaced significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a \\"run\\" on the entities in the \\"parallel\\" banking system, also called the shadow banking system. These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system, but were not subject to the same regulatory controls. Further, these entities were vulnerable because of Asset‚Äìliability mismatch, meaning that they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets. This meant that disruptions in credit markets would force them to engage in rapid deleveraging, selling their long-term assets at depressed prices. He described the significance of these entities: Economist Paul Krugman, laureate of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, described the run on the shadow banking system as the \\"core of what happened\\" to cause the crisis. He referred to this lack of controls as \\"malign neglect\\" and argued that regulation should have been imposed on all banking-like activity. Without the ability to obtain investor funds in exchange for most types of mortgage-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, investment banks and other entities in the shadow banking system could not provide funds to mortgage firms and other corporations. This meant that nearly one-third of the U.S. lending mechanism was frozen and continued to be frozen into June 2009. According to the Brookings Institution, at that time the traditional banking system did not have the capital to close this gap: \\"It would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume.\\" The authors also indicate that some forms of securitization were \\"likely to vanish forever, having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions\\". While traditional banks raised their lending standards, it was the collapse of the shadow banking system that was the primary cause of the reduction in funds available for borrowing. The securitization markets supported by the shadow banking system started to close down in the spring of 2007 and nearly shut-down in the fall of 2008. More than a third of the private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds. According to the Brookings Institution in June 2009, the traditional banking system did not have the capital to close this gap: \\"It would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume\\" and some forms of securitization are \\"likely to vanish forever, having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions\\". =Commodity price inflation= Rapid increases in several commodity prices followed the collapse in the housing bubble. The price of oil nearly tripled from $50 to $147 from early 2007 to 2008, before plunging as the financial crisis began to take hold in late 2008. Experts debate the causes, with some attributing it to speculative flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities, some to monetary policy, and some to the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast-growing world, leading to long positions taken on those markets, such as Chinese increasing presence in Africa. An increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline, which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries, as wealth flows to oil-producing states. There was a pattern of spiking instability in the price of oil over the decade leading up to the price high of 2008. The destabilizing effects of this price variance was proposed as a contributory factor in the financial crisis. Global copper prices Copper prices increased at the same time as oil prices. Copper traded at about $2,500 per ton from 1990 until 1999, when it fell to about $1,600. The price slump lasted until 2004, when a price surge pushed copper to $7,040 per ton in 2008. Nickel prices boomed in the late 1990s, then declined from around $51,000 /¬£36,700 per metric ton in May 2007 to about $11,550/¬£8,300 per metric ton in January 2009. Prices were only just starting to recover as of January 2010, but most of Australia's nickel mines had gone bankrupt by then. As the price for high grade nickel sulphate ore recovered in 2010, so did the Australian nickel mining industry. Coincidentally with these price fluctuations, long-only commodity index funds became popular‚Äîby one estimate investment increased from $90 billion in 2006 to $200 billion at the end of 2007, while commodity prices increased 71% ‚Äì which raised concern as to whether these index funds caused the commodity bubble. The empirical research has been mixed. =Systemic crisis of capitalism= In a 1998 book, John McMurtry suggested that a financial crisis is a systemic crisis of capitalism itself. In his 1978 book, The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism, Ravi Batra suggests that growing inequality of financial capitalism produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major political changes. He also suggested that a \\"demand gap\\" related to differing wage and productivity growth explains deficit and debt dynamics important to stock market developments. John Bellamy Foster, a political economy analyst and editor of the Monthly Review, believed that the decrease in GDP growth rates since the early 1970s is due to increasing market saturation. Marxian economics followers Andrew Kliman, Michael Roberts, and Guglielmo Carchedi, in contradistinction to the Monthly Review school represented by Foster, pointed to capitalism's long-term tendency of the rate of profit to fall as the underlying cause of crises generally. From this point of view, the problem was the inability of capital to grow or accumulate at sufficient rates through productive investment alone. Low rates of profit in productive sectors led to speculative investment in riskier assets, where there was potential for greater return on investment. The speculative frenzy of the late 90s and 2000s was, in this view, a consequence of a rising organic composition of capital, expressed through the fall in the rate of profit. According to Michael Roberts, the fall in the rate of profit \\"eventually triggered the credit crunch of 2007 when credit could no longer support profits\\". In 2005 book, The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism, John C. Bogle wrote that \\"Corporate America went astray largely because the power of managers went virtually unchecked by our gatekeepers for far too long\\". Echoing the central thesis of James Burnham's 1941 seminal book, The Managerial Revolution, Bogle cites issues, including: * that \\"Manager's capitalism\\" replaced \\"owner's capitalism\\", meaning management runs the firm for its benefit rather than for the shareholders, a variation on the principal‚Äìagent problem; * the burgeoning executive compensation; * the management of earnings, mainly a focus on share price rather than the creation of genuine value; and * the failure of gatekeepers, including auditors, boards of directors, Wall Street analysts, and career politicians. In his book The Big Mo, Mark Roeder, a former executive at the Swiss-based UBS Bank, suggested that large-scale momentum, or The Big Mo \\"played a pivotal role\\" in the financial crisis. Roeder suggested that \\"recent technological advances, such as computer-driven trading programs, together with the increasingly interconnected nature of markets, has magnified the momentum effect. This has made the financial sector inherently unstable.\\" Robert Reich attributed the economic downturn to the stagnation of wages in the United States, particularly those of the hourly workers who comprise 80% of the workforce. This stagnation forced the population to borrow to meet the cost of living. Economists Ailsa McKay and Margunn Bj√∏rnholt argued that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. =Wrong banking model: resiliency of credit unions= A report by the International Labour Organization concluded that cooperative banking institutions were less likely to fail than their competitors during the crisis. The cooperative banking sector had 20% market share of the European banking sector, but accounted for only 7% of all the write-downs and losses between the third quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2011. In 2008, in the U.S., the rate of commercial bank failures was almost triple that of credit unions, and almost five times the credit union rate in 2010. Credit unions increased their lending to small- and medium-sized businesses while overall lending to those businesses decreased. Economists who predicted the crisis Economists, particularly followers of mainstream economics, mostly failed to predict the crisis. The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania's online business journal examined why economists failed to predict a major global financial crisis and concluded that economists used mathematical models that failed to account for the critical roles that banks and other financial institutions, as opposed to producers and consumers of goods and services, play in the economy. Popular articles published in the mass media have led the general public to believe that the majority of economists have failed in their obligation to predict the financial crisis. For example, an article in The New York Times noted that economist Nouriel Roubini warned of such crisis as early as September 2006, and stated that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions. According to The Guardian, Roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession, while The New York Times labelled him \\"Dr. Doom\\". Within mainstream financial economics, most believe that financial crises are simply unpredictable, following Eugene Fama's efficient-market hypothesis and the related random-walk hypothesis, which state respectively that markets contain all information about possible future movements, and that the movements of financial prices are random and unpredictable. Recent research casts doubt on the accuracy of \\"early warning\\" systems of potential crises, which must also predict their timing. The Austrian School regarded the crisis as a vindication and classic example of a predictable credit-fueled bubble caused by laxity in monetary supply. Several followers of heterodox economics predicted the crisis, with varying arguments. Dirk Bezemer credits 12 economists with predicting the crisis: Dean Baker (US), Wynne Godley (UK), Fred Harrison (UK), Michael Hudson (US), Eric Janszen (US), Steve Keen (Australia), Jakob Broechner Madsen & Jens Kjaer S√∏rensen (Denmark), Med Jones (US) Kurt Richeb√§cher (US), Nouriel Roubini (US), Peter Schiff (US), and Robert Shiller (US). Shiller, a founder of the Case-Shiller index that measures home prices, wrote an article a year before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in which he predicted that a slowing U.S. housing market would cause the housing bubble to burst, leading to financial collapse. Schiff regularly appeared on television in the years before the crisis and warned of the impending real estate collapse. Karim Abadir, based on his work with Gabriel Talmain, predicted the timing of the recession whose trigger had already started manifesting itself in the real economy from early 2007. There were other economists that did warn of a pending crisis. The former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan, had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. In 2005, at a celebration honoring Alan Greenspan, who was about to retire as chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector. In that paper, Rajan \\"argued that disaster might loom\\". Rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to \\"take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but, in return, offer generous compensation the rest of the time. These risks are known as tail risks. But perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialize, financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimized.\\" Stock trader and financial risk engineer Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of the 2007 book The Black Swan, spent years warning against the breakdown of the banking system in particular and the economy in general owing to their use of and reliance on bad risk models and reliance on forecasting, and framed the problem as part of \\"robustness and fragility\\". He also took action against the establishment view by making a big financial bet on banking stocks and making a fortune from the crisis (\\"They didn't listen, so I took their money\\"). According to David Brooks from The New York Times, \\"Taleb not only has an explanation for what's happening, he saw it coming.\\" IndyMac The first visible institution to run into trouble in the United States was the Southern California‚Äìbased IndyMac, a spin-off of Countrywide Financial. Before its failure, IndyMac Bank was the largest savings and loan association in the Los Angeles market and the seventh largest mortgage loan originator in the United States. The failure of IndyMac Bank on July 11, 2008, was the fourth largest bank failure in United States history up until the crisis precipitated even larger failures, and the second largest failure of a regulated thrift. IndyMac Bank's parent corporation was IndyMac Bancorp until the FDIC seized IndyMac Bank. IndyMac Bancorp filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July 2008. IndyMac Bank was founded as Countrywide Mortgage Investment in 1985 by David S. Loeb and Angelo Mozilo as a means of collateralizing Countrywide Financial loans too big to be sold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. In 1997, Countrywide spun off IndyMac as an independent company run by Mike Perry, who remained its CEO until the downfall of the bank in July 2008. The primary causes of its failure were largely associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing Alt-A loans on a large scale. This strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets. From its inception as a savings association in 2000, IndyMac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the United States. During 2006, IndyMac originated over $90 billion of mortgages. IndyMac's aggressive growth strategy, use of Alt-A and other nontraditional loan products, insufficient underwriting, credit concentrations in residential real estate in the California and Florida markets‚Äîstates, alongside Nevada and Arizona, where the housing bubble was most pronounced‚Äîand heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and from brokered deposits, led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007. IndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower's income or assets, and to borrowers with poor credit histories. Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well. As an Alt-A lender, IndyMac's business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower's needs, using an extensive array of risky option-adjustable-rate mortgages (option ARMs), subprime loans, 80/20 loans, and other nontraditional products. Ultimately, loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments. The thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the secondary mortgage market. IndyMac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria: see the comment by Ruthann Melbourne, Chief Risk Officer, to the regulating agencies. On May 12, 2008, in the \\"Capital\\" section of its last 10-Q, IndyMac revealed that it may not be well capitalized in the future. IndyMac reported that during April 2008, Moody's and Standard & Poor's downgraded the ratings on a significant number of Mortgage-backed security (MBS) bonds‚Äîincluding $160 million issued by IndyMac that the bank retained in its MBS portfolio. IndyMac concluded that these downgrades would have harmed its risk-based capital ratio as of June 30, 2008. Had these lowered ratings been in effect at March 31, 2008, IndyMac concluded that the bank's capital ratio would have been 9.27% total risk-based. IndyMac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below \\"well capitalized\\" (minimum 10% risk-based capital ratio) to \\"adequately capitalized\\" (8‚Äì10% risk-based capital ratio) the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds. Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) later pointed out that brokered deposits made up more than 37% of IndyMac's total deposits, and ask the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) whether it had considered ordering IndyMac to reduce its reliance on these deposits. With $18.9 billion in total deposits reported on March 31, Senator Schumer would have been referring to a little over $7 billion in brokered deposits. While the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly, a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to IndyMac at $500 million a month, had the regulator disallowed IndyMac from acquiring new brokered deposits on June 30. IndyMac was taking new measures to preserve capital, such as deferring interest payments on some preferred securities. Dividends on common shares had already been suspended for the first quarter of 2008, after being cut in half the previous quarter. The company still had not secured a significant capital infusion nor found a ready buyer. IndyMac reported that the bank's risk-based capital was only $47 million above the minimum required for this 10% mark. But it did not reveal some of that $47 million capital it claimed it had, as of March 31, 2008, was fabricated. When home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed, IndyMac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. Its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late June 2008 when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion or about 7.5% of IndyMac's deposits. This bank run on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from Senator Charles Schumer to the FDIC and OTS. The letter outlined the Senator's concerns with IndyMac. While the run was a contributing factor in the timing of IndyMac's demise, the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound way it was operated. On June 26, 2008, Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY), a member of the Senate Banking Committee, chairman of Congress' Joint Economic Committee and the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, released several letters he had sent to regulators, in which he was\\"concerned that IndyMac's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers.\\" Some worried depositors began to withdraw money. On July 7, 2008, IndyMac announced on the company blog that it: * Had failed to raise capital since its May 12, 2008 quarterly earnings report; * Had been notified by bank and thrift regulators that IndyMac Bank was no longer deemed \\"well-capitalized\\"; IndyMac announced the closure of both its retail lending and wholesale divisions, halted new loan submissions, and cut 3,800 jobs. On July 11, 2008, citing liquidity concerns, the FDIC put IndyMac Bank into conservatorship. A bridge bank, IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB, was established to assume control of IndyMac Bank's assets, its secured liabilities, and its insured deposit accounts. The FDIC announced plans to open IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB on July 14, 2008. Until then, depositors would have access their insured deposits through ATMs, their existing checks, and their existing debit cards. Telephone and Internet account access was restored when the bank reopened. The FDIC guarantees the funds of all insured accounts up to US$100,000, and declared a special advance dividend to the roughly 10,000 depositors with funds in excess of the insured amount, guaranteeing 50% of any amounts in excess of $100,000. Yet, even with the pending sale of Indymac to IMB Management Holdings, an estimated 10,000 uninsured depositors of Indymac are still at a loss of over $270 million. With $32 billion in assets, IndyMac Bank was one of the largest bank failures in American history. IndyMac Bancorp filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on July 31, 2008. Initially the companies affected were those directly involved in home construction and mortgage lending such as Northern Rock and Countrywide Financial, as they could no longer obtain financing through the credit markets. Over 100 mortgage lenders went bankrupt during 2007 and 2008. Concerns that investment bank Bear Stearns would collapse in March 2008 resulted in its fire-sale to JP Morgan Chase. The financial institution crisis hit its peak in September and October 2008. Several major institutions either failed, were acquired under duress, or were subject to government takeover. These included Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Citigroup, and AIG. On October 6, 2008, three weeks after Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, Lehman's former CEO Richard S. Fuld Jr. found himself before Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who chaired the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Fuld said he was a victim of the collapse, blaming a \\"crisis of confidence\\" in the markets for dooming his firm. Notable books and movies * In 2006, Peter Schiff authored a book titled Crash Proof: How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse, which was published in February 2007 by Wiley. The book describes various features of the economy and housing market that led to the United States housing bubble, and warns of the impending decline. After many of the predictions came to pass, a second edition titled Crash Proof 2.0 was published in 2009, which included a \\"2009 update\\" addendum at the end of each chapter. It was featured on The New York Times Best Seller list. *Meltdown: A Free-Market Look at Why the Stock Market Collapsed, the Economy Tanked, and the Government Bailout Will Make Things Worse, by Thomas Woods, was published in February 2009 by Regnery Publishing. It was featured on The New York Times Best Seller list for 10 weeks * A 2010 documentary film, Overdose: A Film about the Next Financial Crisis, describes how the financial crisis came about and how the solutions that have been applied by many governments are setting the stage for the next crisis. The film is based on the book Financial Fiasco by Johan Norberg and features Alan Greenspan, with funding from the libertarian think tank Cato Institute. * In October 2010, a documentary film about the crisis, Inside Job directed by Charles Ferguson, was released by Sony Pictures Classics. In 2011, it was awarded the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 83rd Academy Awards. * Michael Lewis authored a best-selling non-fiction book about the crisis, entitled The Big Short. In 2015, it was adapted into a film of the same name, which won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. One point raised is to what extent those outside of the markets themselves (i.e., not working for a mainstream investment bank) could forecast the events and be generally less myopic. * Subsequent to the crisis, Nate Drumond in The Power of Three: Discovering What Really Matters in Life noted a change in social relations as some group culpability emerged. * Set on the night before the crisis broke, Margin Call is a movie that follows traders through a sleepless 24 hours as they try to contain the damage after an analyst discovers information that is likely to ruin their firm, and possibly the whole economy. * The US documentary program Frontline produced several episodes investigating various aspects of the crisis: ** \\"Inside the Meltdown\\" (Season 2009: Episode 8) ** \\"Ten Trillion and Counting\\" (Season 2009: Episode 9) ** \\"Breaking the Bank\\" (Season 2009: Episode 15) ** \\"The Warning\\" (Season 2009: Episode 2) See also * Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 (United Kingdom) * 2008‚Äì2011 bank failures in the United States * 2008‚Äì2009 Keynesian resurgence * 2010 United States foreclosure crisis * 2012 May Day protests * Crisis (Marxian) * Europeans for Financial Reform * Kondratiev wave * List of banks acquired or bankrupted during the Great Recession * List of acquired or bankrupt United States banks in the late 2000s financial crisis * List of acronyms: European sovereign-debt crisis * List of economic crises * List of entities involved in 2007‚Äì2008 financial crises * List of largest U.S. bank failures * Low-Income Countries Under Stress * Mark- to-market accounting * Neoliberalism * Occupy movement * Pessimism porn * PIGS (economics) * Private equity in the 2000s * Subprime crisis impact timeline * The Chicago Plan Revisited References The initial articles and some subsequent material were adapted from the Wikinfo article Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 released under the GNU Free Documentation License Version 1.2 Further reading * Kotz, David M.

Sun Records was established in 1952 in Memphis, Tennessee, and during an eight-year period Sun Records signed such artists as Roy Orbison, B.B. King, Howlin' Wolf, Ike Turner, Rufus Thomas, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Harold Jenkins, and Charlie Rich. The musicians signed at Sun Records made music that laid the foundation of rock and roll in the 20th century. History Roy Kelton Orbison was born in Vernon, Texas, on April 23, 1936, and he grew up in Wink, Texas. His parents Orbie Lee and Nadine, gave him a guitar for his sixth birthday and taught him the chords to \\"You Are My Sunshine\\". Roy Orbison grew up around country music and later stated it was a great influence to him. ‚ÄúI grew up with country music in Texas. The first singer I heard on the radio who really slayed me was Lefty Frizzell. He had this technique which involved sliding syllables together that really blew me away.‚Äù By the time Orbison was eight years old he was performing on local radio shows, and at thirteen years old he formed the band The Wink Westerners. The Wink Westerners obtained local notoriety and performed mainly country and pop songs. He began singing and playing guitar professionally in his teens with the band the Wink Westerners. The Wink Westerners had a weekly television show for them on KMID-TV. Roy Orbison attended North Texas University after high school, and it was there where he discovered rock and roll and began to write more pop oriented songs. Orbison stayed at North Texas for only a year stating he felt like he was in the ‚Äúwrong place at the wrong time.‚Äù He left and moved to Odessa, Texas where he formed The Teen Kings. The Teen Kings consisted of Roy Orbison, James Morrow, Jack Kennelley, Billy Pat Ellis, and Johnny ‚ÄúPeanuts‚Äù Wilson. The Teen Kings got a job on a local television show and they recorded ‚ÄúOoby Dooby‚Äù (written by two fellow North Texas State students Dick Penner and Wade Moore) for a local label. In 1956, singer/songwriter Johnny Cash appeared on the show and on his advice Orbison and the Teen Kings signed with Sun Records in Memphis. Shortly after signing a new version of \\"Ooby Dooby\\" was recorded and became a hit in 1956. \\"Ooby Dooby\\" did well nationwide, reaching #59 on the Billboards Hot 100 and sold roughly 200,000 copies. According to the official Roy Orbison discography by Marcel Riesco, the follow-up single was \\"Rockhouse\\" b/w \\"You're My Baby\\", and shortly after this release the Teen Kings disbanded, and Orbison remained under contract to Sun as a solo artist. Orbison continued recording using the Sun house musicians. Not unlike several other artists at Sun, Roy Orbison was unhappy with the direction Sam Phillips was taking. Orbison noted that he wasn't quite comfortable with rockabilly but later stated he enjoyed the freedom in the studio that came with being a Sun artist. Sun‚Äôs musical director Bill Justice gave Orbison the song ‚ÄúChicken Hearted.‚Äù Released in December 1957, it was Orbison‚Äôs last shot at remaining a contracted artist for Sun. Shortly after the failure of \\"Chicken Hearted\\", Orbison moved back to Texas with his first wife Claudette Frady. Sam Phillips later stated having regret in not promoting Orbison more than he did. Orbison began to question rather or not he still wanted to be a performer and began to focus more on writing. As a writer, Orbison scored a Hot 100 hit for Warren Smith with \\"So Long I'm Gone\\" and he did even better when Jerry Lee Lewis recorded a new version of \\"Go!, Go!, Go!\\", renaming the track \\"Down The Line.\\" The greatest writing success Orbison had was due to The Everly Brothers recording the song \\"Claudette\\". The success of \\"Claudette\\" gave Orbison enough money to buy himself out of his contract at Sun and he signed over all of his copyrights in exception to \\"Claudette\\". Roy Orbison played lead guitar in all of his Sun Records recordings, creating a breakthrough sound which became such a big part of rockabilly music. According to Riesco's official Roy Orbison discography, Orbison's first 2 Sun singles were released in the UK on an extended play called \\"Hillbilly Rock\\" (London Records RES 1089) in 1957. Orbison affiliated himself with the Everlys' music publisher, Acuff-Rose. Wesley Rose got Orbison a one-year contract with RCA, an affiliation that spawned two mediocre singles. During the last RCA session, Orbison had a conversation with bassist Bob Moore, who was buying himself a stake in Monument Records. Moore called owner Fred Foster, and said, \\"You know what I heard today? RCA's letting Roy Orbison go.\\" Fred Foster signed Roy Orbison. Orbison, still in Texas began writing with Joe Melson, who led a group in Midland called the Cavaliers. Together they wrote the hit \\"Uptown,\\" which sold better than any single since \\"Ooby Dooby\\". Looking for a follow-up, Melson showed Orbison a piece of a song he had been working on called \\"Only the Lonely\\". This song was the \\"first song that truly probed the frightening potential of Orbison's voice.\\" In the early sixties Orbison reached his first peak period from 1961-1964. Despite the lack of commercial success Orbison looked back at his time at Sun Records as an important and historical part of his career. Into the seventies and early eighties artists such as Linda Ronstadt, Van Halen, Don McLean, had hits with Orbison's songs. In 1980 Roy Orbison released \\"That Lovin' You Feelin' Again\\" with Emmylou Harris, winning the artists a grammy.Pond, 3 After Roy's death in 1988 he had two simultaneous posthumously-charting Top 5 albums with Mystery Girl and The Traveling Wilburys.

Her music incorporates elements of varied styles and genres including art pop, synth-pop, dream pop, R&B;, electronic music, and hip hop. Born and raised in Vancouver, Grimes began releasing music independently late in the first decade of the 2000s, releasing two albums, Geidi Primes and Halfaxa in 2010 on Arbutus Records. She subsequently signed with 4AD and rose to fame with the release of her third studio album Visions in 2012. It produced the singles \\"Genesis\\" and \\"Oblivion\\", and received the Juno Award for Electronic Album of the Year. Her fourth studio album Art Angels (2015) received critical praise, and was named the best album of the year by several publications. Her fifth studio album, Miss Anthropocene, was released on February 21, 2020. Life and career =1988‚Äì2008: Early life= Claire Boucher was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.Sound says most to Grimes . Retrieved June 7, 2011. She is of French, Italian, and Ukrainian descent. She was raised Roman Catholic, and attended Catholic school. Her mother, Sandy Garossino, is a former Crown prosecutor and arts advocate; her father, a former banker, works \\"in the business side of biotech\\". In 2006, Boucher graduated from Lord Byng Secondary School and relocated from Vancouver to Montreal to attend McGill University focusing on neuroscience and Russian language, but left the school in early 2011 before finishing her degree. According to the timestamps on her original Myspace page, Boucher began writing music under the name Grimes in 2007. Her performer name was chosen because at the time, MySpace allowed artists to list three musical genres. She listed grime for all three, before knowing what grime music was. Grimes is self-taught in music and visual art. =2009‚Äì2013: Career beginnings and Visions= Grimes performing at South by Southwest 2012 Boucher's debut album as Grimes, Geidi Primes, is a concept album inspired by the Dune series. It was released by Arbutus Records on cassette in 2010. Later in 2010, Boucher released her second album on Arbutus Records, Halfaxa. After the release of Halfaxa, Boucher began publicly promoting Grimes and started touring beyond Montreal. In 2011 Boucher released five songs on her side of the split 12\\" with d'Eon, Darkbloom (through both Arbutus and Hippos in Tanks). Beginning in May 2011, Grimes opened for Lykke Li on her North American Tour, and the following August her debut album was re-released through No Pain in Pop Records, in CD and vinyl format for the first time. In 2011, she collaborated with DJ/producer Blood Diamonds. Following extensive touring and positive reception to her first two albums and Darkbloom contribution, Boucher signed with record label 4AD in January 2012. The subsequent release, Visions, appeared on a number of publications' year-end lists and is considered Grimes' breakout album. NME included it on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2013. Visions won the Electronic Album of the Year Award and Grimes was nominated for the Breakthrough Artist of the Year at the Junos. Grimes also won the Artist of the Year Award at the 2013 Webbys. The album's second single, \\"Oblivion\\", also received critical acclaim and was produced into a music video co-directed by Emily Kai Bock and Grimes. Pitchfork ranked \\"Oblivion\\" at number one on their 200 Best Tracks of the Decade So Far list in 2014. In interviews following the album's release, Boucher explained that she was assigned a strict deadline by which to have her third album finished far before it was complete, resulting in her recording the bulk of Visions while isolated in her Montreal apartment for three consecutive weeks. Notably, this intensive recording session included a period of nine days without sleep, food, or companionship, with Boucher blacking out her windows, since she generally could not make music as readily during the day, and doing \\"tons of amphetamines\\" She described the writing process as being \\"equally enjoyable and tortuous\\", feeling that its difficulty contributed to its success. In April 2013, Boucher posted a written statement addressing her experience as a female musician in an industry rife with sexism and expressed disappointment that her feminist stance was often interpreted as anti-male. When speaking about her preference to produce all her studio albums herself, she said, \\"I don't wanna be just like the face of this thing I built, I want to be the one who built it\\". On December 17, 2013, Boucher posted to her Tumblr that she had employed the services of Jay Z's management company, Roc Nation. =2014‚Äì2017: Art Angels= Grimes performing at the Governors Ball in June 2014 On June 26, 2014, Grimes premiered her new track \\"Go\\", produced by and featuring Blood Diamonds. It was a track that had been written for and rejected by Rihanna and was premiered on Zane Lowe's radio 1 show. Rolling Stone ranked it number fourteen on their Best Songs of 2014 list. On March 8, 2015, Grimes released a self-directed video for a demo version of \\"REALiTi\\" from an abandoned album. It received critical acclaim from music critics, being named Best New Music by Jenn Pelly from Pitchfork, calling it the \\"best new Grimes song since Visions.\\" On March 15, 2015, Grimes and Bleachers released their collaboration, \\"Entropy\\" for the HBO TV show Girls. On May 24, 2015, Grimes announced via a series of tweets to her fans that her upcoming album would be \\"surprise\\" released sometime in October. She also explained that the album would be a departure from previous singles \\"Go\\" and \\"REALiTi\\" and was recorded with \\"real instruments\\", a departure from the primarily synth and sampler driven composing of her prior releases. In the summer of 2015, Grimes toured with Lana Del Rey for several of her Endless Summer Tour dates. She then toured in the fall of 2015 as the headliner of her own Rhinestone Cowgirls Tour with opener Nicole Dollanganger. On October 26, 2015, Grimes simultaneously released the lead single of the album, \\"Flesh Without Blood\\", and a two-act music video featuring both \\"Flesh Without Blood\\" and an additional song from the album, \\"Life in the Vivid Dream.\\" After its November release, the album received favourable reviews, garnering an 88 (out of 100) rating on Metacritic and the Best New Music designation from Pitchfork. Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork described Art Angels as \\"evidence of Boucher's labor and an articulation of a pop vision that is incontrovertibly hers... an epic holiday buffet of tendentious feminist fuck-off, with second helpings for anonymous commenters and music industry blood-suckers.\\" Art Angels was named best album of the year by NME, Exclaim! and Stereogum. It peaked at number 1 on the Billboard US Top Alternative Album Chart and number 2 on the Billboard Top Independent Album chart. Grimes won the 2016 International award at the Socan Annual Awards and the 2016 Harper's Bazaar Musician of the Year Award in October. Grimes performing at Lollapalooza 2016 In the spring of 2016, Grimes toured Asia and Europe with supporting act Hana on the Ac!d Reign Tour. Grimes continued touring through the summer of 2016, performing at various music festivals across North America and opening for Florence and the Machine on select dates of the How Beautiful Tour. Continuing the series of music videos for songs off Art Angels that began with \\"Flesh Without Blood\\" and \\"Life in the Vivid Dream\\" (\\"Act I\\" and \\"Act II\\", respectively), Boucher released the music video for \\"Kill V. Maim\\" (\\"Act III\\") on January 19, 2016 and the music video for \\"California\\" (\\"Act IV\\") on May 9, 2016. Boucher crafted a slightly remixed version of \\"California\\" for the music video in order to achieve a less \\"dissonant\\" visual/auditory mix. This alternate version of California has not otherwise been officially released for sale or streaming. On August 3, Grimes released the song \\"Medieval Warfare\\" as part of the soundtrack of the summer blockbuster Suicide Squad. On October 5, 2016, Boucher with friend and collaborator Hana Pestle, more commonly known by stage name Hana, released \\"The Ac!d Reign Chronicles\\", a lo-fi series of seven music videos including songs by Grimes (\\"Butterfly\\", \\"World Princess Part II\\", \\"Belly of the Beat\\" and \\"Scream\\") and Hana (\\"Underwater\\", \\"Chimera\\" and \\"Avalanche\\"), each starring in their respective segments. Additional appearances include Aristophanes in SCREAM and two of Grimes' backup dancers, Linda Davis and Alyson Van, throughout the series. \\"The AC!D Reign Chronicles\\" were recorded over the course of two weeks during the duo's time touring Europe and were made with minimal production, shot exclusively on iPhones with no crew aside from Boucher's brother, Mac Boucher, who assisted with filming. Post production, Claire Boucher and Hana Pestle edited the videos in their entirety. \\"Concept & Art direction\\" are credited to Claire Boucher. On February 2, 2017, Grimes premiered on Tidal the high budget futuristic music video of \\"Venus Fly\\", starring herself and Janelle Mon√°e. The video was uploaded on YouTube on February 9. She won Best Dance Video for \\"Venus Fly\\" at the Much Music Video Awards. In 2017, Grimes won a JUNO Award for Video of the Year, featuring \\"Kill V. Maim\\". =2018‚Äìpresent: Miss Anthropocene and collaborations= In February 2018, Grimes wrote on Instagram, \\"well no music any time soon after all.\\" It was later revealed that this was due to a clash with her label, 4AD. She later revealed on an Instagram post that she would eventually be releasing two albums, and that \\"they would be separated by a period of time\\", with the first being released with 4AD, and the second with an undisclosed label. Boucher stated that this first album would be \\"highly collaborative and [characterized by] most glorious light\\", with the second highlighting themes of \\"pure darkness and chaos\\". On April 10, 2018, Grimes was featured on \\"Pynk,\\" the third single from Janelle Mon√°e's album, Dirty Computer. On May 30, 2018, Grimes was featured on \\"Love4Eva\\" by LOONA yyxy from their EP Beauty & the Beat. On June 15, 2018, she was featured in a video for Apple's Behind the Mac series on their YouTube channel, with a preview of a song from her upcoming album titled \\"That's What the Drugs Are For\\", later released as \\"My Name Is Dark\\". On the same day, she posted two Twitter videos previewing two songs from her upcoming album, \\"adore u (beautiful game)\\" and \\"4 √¶m\\". In 2018, Grimes composed the theme music for Netflix's animated series Hilda. On October 31, 2018, Grimes was featured on \\"Play Destroy\\" by Poppy on her album Am I a Girl?

On August 13, 2019, Grimes posted an advertisement for the Adidas by Stella McCartney Fall 2019 collection on Instagram, of which Grimes is the face. The description announced that the first single from Miss Anthropocene would be released on September 13, 2019. On September 5, 2019, Grimes released the music video for \\"Violence\\", featuring i_o, the second single from Miss Anthropocene. On October 25, 2019, an unfinished version of Miss Anthropocene leaked online. On November 15, 2019, two versions of the single \\"So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth\\" were released: the Art Mix (6:13, album version) and the Algorithm Mix (3:51). She performed an additional new track \\"4√¶m\\" the same day at the 2019 Video Game Awards in order to introduce herself as a voiced character in the game Cyberpunk 2077. Miss Anthropocene was released on February 21, 2020. That same month, she released the single \\"Delete Forever\\", which was partly inspired by the death of Lil Peep and the ongoing opioid crisis. Artistry =Musical style= Grimes' music draws on an eclectic mix of styles, including synth-pop, dream pop, art pop, electronic music, R&B;, and hip hop, Her work has been likened to various artists, including Bj√∂rk, Julianna Barwick, Siouxsie Sioux, and Enya. She was described by Tastemakers Magazine as an \\"alien love-child of Aphex Twin and ABBA\\". The Guardian summarised her musical style: \\"By sounding a little like everything you've ever heard, the whole sounds like nothing you've ever heard.\\" The Japan Times wrote that Grimes' \\"otherworldly, Ableton-assisted music is crammed full of hooks fit to sit alongside Rihanna and Taylor Swift in the Top 40\\". Dazed stated: \\"In a sense, she‚Äôd always thrived on being too pop for indie and too indie for pop\\". Her lyrics were described by The Guardian as \\"generally elusive and impressionistic, shying away from specifics\\". Grimes is a soprano. The Daily Telegraph described her vocals as \\"sweet, thin and hazy.\\" She utilizes looping and layering techniques, particularly with vocals; many of her songs feature layers of over fifty different vocal tracks which create an \\"ethereal\\" sound. Grimes described her music as \\"ADD music\\", shifting frequently and dramatically ‚Äì \\"I go through phases a lot.\\" She said \\"Most music with traditional verse, chorus and bridge structures can probably be considered 'pop.' But I think most people think about Top 40 these days when they use the word 'pop,' and I'm emphatically not from that world.\\" She said that Panda Bear's 2007 album Person Pitch \\"jumpstarted\\" her mind. She explains, \\"Up until that point I had basically only made weird atonal drone music, with no sense of songwriting. I barely understood anything about music ... But suddenly all music clicked into place and seemed so simple and easy. I was pretty much able to spontaneously write songs immediately after listening to this album once.\\"Stereogum: Grimes Writes About 5 Albums That Changed Her Life .

Visual art Grimes created the album art for all of her albums, as well as art lithos for each track on Art Angels that were sold with the vinyl release. Her art is influenced by Japanese anime, manga, and comic artists such as Charles Burns and Daniel Clowes. Grimes illustrates her merchandise, including T-shirts, album art and show posters. Her illustrations have appeared in gallery shows, including at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. She created an alternate cover for Image Comics' The Wicked + The Divine and designed a capsule collection of T-shirts for Saint Laurent in 2013. That year, she also curated a two-day event at the Audio Visual Arts (AVA) Gallery in NYC with a silent auction to benefit the Native Women's Association of Canada's campaign to raise awareness of violence against Aboriginal women in Canada. Personal life Boucher has a step-brother who raps under the name Jay Worthy; they collaborated on the single, \\"Christmas Song\\", which was released on the Rough Trade bonus disc of her album, Visions. One of her brothers, Mac Boucher, was involved in the making of some of her music videos, such as \\"Violence\\", \\"Go\\", \\"Realiti\\", \\"Flesh Without Blood/Life in the Vivid Dream\\", \\"Kill V. Maim\\", \\"Venus Fly\\" and \\"We Appreciate Power\\". In 2009, Boucher and a friend attempted to sail down the Mississippi River to New Orleans from Minneapolis in a houseboat they built. Following several mishaps, including engine trouble and encounters with law enforcement, the houseboat was impounded by the city of Minneapolis. Boucher claims that elements of the story, were exaggerated in the newspapers that reported on it at the time. The adventure has been turned into an animated video narrated by T-Bone Burnett. In the past, Boucher has been open about her drug use, stating during the creation of Visions in 2012, she \\"blacked out the windows and did tons of amphetamines and stayed up for three weeks and didn't eat anything\\". In 2011, she and fellow Canadian artist d'Eon spent \\"a week playing shows and doing acid in Mexico City\\". In 2014, Boucher wrote a blog post expressing her aversion to hard drugs, distancing herself from her previous endorsement, saying she does not want \\"[hard drug use] to be part of [her] narrative\\". \\"Losing people to drugs and alcohol is the worst because they destroy any good memories you have of them before forcing you to deal with the empty space they leave behind\\" she said. \\"I want people to know that I hate hard drugs. All they've ever done is kill my friends and cause me to be unproductive.\\" Boucher is a vegetarian for ethical reasons, and usually avoids dairy but says she will eat it on the road if nothing else is available because she \\"won't starve [her]self.\\" As a singer, Boucher is known for having a lisp; she stated that she \\"likes it\\", and has no desire to undergo speech therapy. From 2007 to 2010, Boucher was in an on-and-off relationship with Devon Welsh, then the lead vocalist of Majical Cloudz. The two met in 2007 at a first-year dorm party while studying at McGill University. Since 2018, she has been called c (the symbol for the speed of light) in her personal life. Since 2018, Boucher has been in a relationship with technology entrepreneur Elon Musk. They met after discovering on Twitter that they both came up with the same pun relating to Rococo and the thought experiment Roko's basilisk. On January 8, 2020, Boucher announced that she was pregnant with her and Musk's first child together. Grimes gave birth to their son on May 4, 2020, with Musk announcing via Twitter that both Grimes and their baby were doing well. Boucher and Musk have stated that they named the child as \\"\\" (pronounced \\"Ex Ash A Twelve\\" or \\"Ex Ay Eye\\"), although it has been reported that the name violates the naming law in California, where the child was born. On May 24, Boucher announced the name was changed to \\"X √Ü A-Xii\\". According to an image of the birth certificate released by TMZ, the letter \\"X\\" is the child's first name, and his middle name is \\"AE A-XII\\". Grimes claimed via Instagram that Go Won, a member of the Korean girl group Loona who she previously collaborated with in 2018, was the Godmother of her son. In July 2020, Elon Musk tweeted \\"Pronouns suck\\". Grimes publicly responded with a tweet of her own stating that while she \\"loved him\\" she \\"cannot support hate.\\" Her critical tweet was deleted soon after it was posted.

It was self-published under the banner of Rubber Blanket Press in a deluxe, oversized format from 1991 to 1993 (three issues). While an anthology of different artists, Rubber Blanket is mostly a showcase for Mazzucchelli's work. In it, he largely turns his back on the superhero work that had made him a fan-favorite, and moved towards a personal storytelling style with bold and more expressionistic artwork. These stories earned Mazzucchelli the 72nd position on The Comics Journal's list of the best comics of the 20th century. Publication history Mazzucchelli autographing copies of the series at a June 28, 2012 signing at Midtown Comics in Manhattan. Mazzucchelli had achieved success working on a number of popular titles, including Batman: Year One for DC Comics and Daredevil for Marvel, when he abruptly left the world of superheroes (supposedly giving up an offer to draw the popular X-Men series) to make more personal works. He didn't produce any commercial work for a year, and studied underground comix and children's books, and took printmaking classes. In 1991 he published the first issue of the anthology Rubber Blanket in a deluxe, oversized format. Each issue was 9\\"x12\\", and was self-published by Mazzucchelli and Lewis under the imprint of Rubber Blanket Press, based in Hoboken, New Jersey. The name was taken from the rubber blanket used to transfer ink from the printing plates to the printing surface in offset printing. The title was meant to indicate that the printing process was integral to the work published therein. Rubber Blanket was mainly a vehicle for Mazzucchelli to publish his more adventurous work, but it also showcased a few other artists' work: Ted Stearn's \\"Fuzz and Pluck\\", works by David Hornung, some work by Mazzucchelli's wife Richmond Lewis, and the beginning of a translation of the Italian \\"Happy Birthday, Signora\\" by Massimo Semerano and Francesca Ghermandi. \\"Happy Birthday, Signora\\" was later continued in the Kim Thompson-edited Zero Zero from Fantagraphics, starting in issue #19, and renamed \\"Pop. 666\\". The chapter that was printed in Rubber Blanket #3 was reprinted in a new translation in Zero Zero #20, sometimes referring to the translation Mazzucchelli was involved with. A fourth issue was never published, as Mazzucchelli had notices that his stories were getting longerfrom 9 pages to 24 and ultimately to 34 pages for \\"Big Man\\" in issue #3. Mazzucchelli wanted more space and wanted to dedicate the fourth issue to one long story. That story ended up being Asterios Polyp, which was published as a hardcover graphic novel by Pantheon Books in 2009. Issues The stories in Rubber Blanket have never been collected in English.

The journalist Ed Vulliamy, whose reporting of Trnopolje and another concentration camp at Omarska helped draw public attention to the atrocities being perpetrated in the Prijedor camp system, described Aliƒá as being \\"probably the most familiar figure in the world\\" in the summer of 1992, when the image of his emaciated frame, seen behind barbed wire at the Trnopolje concentration camp, was seen around the world as emblematic of the violence being inflicted on non-Serb civilians by Bosnian Serbs under the leadership of Radovan Karad≈æiƒá during the Bosnian War and genocide.\\"I am waiting. No one has ever said sorry\\" by Ed Vulliamy, guardian.co.uk, 26 July 2008, accessed 23 July 2011 Press visit to Omarska and Trnopolje In the summer of 1992, in response to media interest roused by rumours about atrocities being committed by Bosnian Serb forces in ad hoc prison camps, the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karad≈æiƒá invited journalists including Roy Gutman, a British film crew from ITN, and The Guardian‚Äôs Ed Vulliamy to visit the camps. Local Serb officials sought to block their access to the camps but eventually took Penny Marshall, Ian Williams and Ed Vulliamy to Omarska, where they were allowed to speak to prisoners in the canteen under very constrained circumstances. They were stopped at gunpoint by the camp commander from visiting the areas of the camp where most of the prisoners were being held. After leaving Omarska they drove past another camp, Trnopolje, where they found more shocking scenes. The journalists, accompanied by camp guards and a Serbian television crew, interviewed staff and inmates. Fikret Aliƒá was among a group of very recently arrived prisoners from the Keraterm camp being held in a corner of the camp, which was also a transit camp for the removal of the non-Serb population from the local Kozarac and Prijedor area. The footage from Omarska and Trnopolje was broadcast by ITN on 6 August 1992. The image of Fikret Aliƒá, his emaciated condition highlighted by his gaunt face and protruding ribs and his prisoner status emphasised by a prominent strand of barbed wire, was prominently featured. The reporters' confirmation of the camps' existence and the suffering of inmates fuelled public outrage about the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Aliƒá's image became iconic of the suffering of civilians and prisoners. In a rare emotive address, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher criticized her successor John Major's inaction, beginning with the words \\"I never thought I‚Äôd see another holocaust in my life.\\" The Report submitted to the United Nations Security Council by the Bassiouni Commission, the Commission of Experts investigating the reports of atrocities in Bosnia, identified Trnopolje as a concentration camp functioning as a staging area for mass deportations mainly of women, children, and elderly men and described the Omarska and Keraterm camps to which the adult non-Serb men were taken as death camps. The regime at Trnopolje was far better than in Omarska and Keraterm but \\"none the less harassment and malnutrition was a problem for all the inmates. Rapes, beatings and other kinds of torture and even killings were not rare.\\" Although the Commission considered that Trnopolje was not a death camp like Omarska or Keraterm, it observed that \\"the label ¬´concentration camp¬ª is nonetheless justified for Logor Trnopolje due to the regime prevailing in the camp.\\" (The Report used the Bosnian word \\"logor\\" specifically to distinguish the Prijedor camps from the wide range of institutions encompassed by the English term \\"camp\\" and emphasise the inhumane nature of the camp regimes.) The LM controversy The journalists' reports were used as evidence in war crimes tribunals in The Hague. But the picture also sparked controversy; five years after its original publication, the magazine LM (formerly Living Marxism) published an article entitled 'The Picture that Fooled the World', claiming that the reporting had been misconstrued to give a misleading impression of the camp as a concentration camp run by Serbs for Bosniaks and Croats rather than just a collection centre for refugees. It was alleged that Aliƒá's emaciated condition was the result of a childhood bout of tuberculosis. Ed Vulliamy retorted that those who had died in Trnopolje and Omarska camps were those ‚Äòmost horribly insulted‚Äô by the LM suggestions. Aliƒá denied LM allegations and testified against his tormentors in a libel action in the UK High Court brought by ITN against LM. Following dramatic evidence given by the camp doctor Idriz Merd≈æaniƒá the jury found against LM and awarded substantial damages to ITN and the journalists.\\"High stakes in battle over Serbian guilt - ITN libel trial: Terrified eyes of a camp doctor said more than celebrity campaigning or the might of a giant news organisation\\", Julia Hartley-Brewer, The Guardian, 15 March 2000, accessed 23 July 2011 Aliƒá subsequently described to the Bosnian television programme 60 minuta how his condition was brought about by the internal injuries he suffered in the brutal treatment he experienced in the death camp at Keraterm. He also described how he had had to be smuggled out of the camp disguised as a woman.

As of 2000, the neighborhood had a population of 4,942, which was 83% black and 11% white. Aetna borders directly on Miller Beach to the northeast, but is separated from the Emerson and Pulaski neighborhoods to the west by the industrial corridor along Interstate 65, and from the town of Lake Station to the south and east by the floodplain of the Little Calumet River. Aetna is divided from the Miller Beach neighborhood by Route 20 with Aetna being the area of Gary East of I65 but south of U.S. 20. Aetna's housing stock is dominated by small single-family homes, with 89% occupancy and 66% owner-occupancy as of 2000. Aetna's housing prices are significantly below the city average. This contrasts to homes in neighboring Miller Beach, which are among the city's most expensive. A typical residential street in Aetna Aetna shares with Miller Beach the U.S. 20 retail corridor, one of the major retail areas in Gary. It is home to a 3.5-acre city park, Aetna Park. Aetna is also near the much larger recreational areas of Miller Beach, such as Marquette Park and the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. It is served by a single bus route of the Gary Public Transportation Corporation; the same route also serves Miller Beach. Aetna was founded in 1881 as a company town for the Aetna Powder Company, a munitions manufacturer. The location was chosen in part for its remoteness, in rolling dune and swale country nearly a mile from the small town of Miller. The factory employed about 500 workers, most of whom lived in Aetna although some commuted from nearby towns. Originally the munitions had to be carted to the train station in Miller for shipment, but the arrival of the Wabash Railroad in 1895 gave Aetna its own train station. The plant suffered from frequent violent explosions, often fatal; a 1912 explosion caused six deaths, and another in 1914 broke windows as far away as downtown Gary. During World War I, the factory employed 1200 people. However, it closed after the war, and Aetna's population shrank to fewer than 100. Aetna was incorporated as a town in 1907. It was annexed by Gary in proceedings lasting from 1924 to 1928. Aetna's southeastern corner consists of undeveloped wetlands.

Sherwana Castle is the ancestral home to the Jaff family. History It was built by Mohamed Pasha Jaff, Kurdish king named by the Ottomans Empire in the 1800s. After the Mamluk Vali of Baghdad, Suleiaman Pasha, dealt a crushing defeat to the Persian occupation of Abbas Mirza Qajar of Northern Mesopotamia, and put to flight the Babans in 1850, Mohamed Pasha Jaff along with the Jaff nomads were allowed to dwell in the Shahrizor unharassed by the Ottomans or Persians in any way. A golden age began for the Jaff as they became a major power in all the region. Their nomadic caravans were allowed pasture from Khanaqin and Qizil Rubat to Panjwin in the Shahrizor region of Kurdistan. In these regions Mohammed Pasha Jaff from his position of power began to crack down on all of his enemies from the Pro Baban Jaff under Aziz Beg Jaff, who was the son of Kai Khasrow Beg Jaff to the rival tribe of the Hemevand, who were anti Ottoman and anti everything. He would erect a fortress on the banks of the Shirwan river to guard against all of these foes in 1866. This fortress is now known as the Shirwana fortress. In 1868, he would be appointed by the Mamluk Vali Suliaman Pasha of Baghdad. The Jaff's rivals, Hamavands, would go to the Caucasus and fight under for the Russians against the Ottomans. The Russians would arm them and send them back to agitate the Shahrizor and create anarchy. Osman Pasha Jaff's son, would be given the residence of the fortress, as his father concerned himself with the affairs of Gulanbar and Halabja, Mohammed Ali Beg Jaff. During World War I the Jaff and the Kurds would fall into obscurity as most of the war took place in the South between the Ottomans and British, fighting a back forth battle around Kut, which the Ottomans would deal the British their worst defeat during the war. The British would finally get the upper hand through other fronts, the Palestine front especially. The Ottomans would sign the Treaty of Mudros in 1917. The British would then occupy Mesopotamia, and the Ottoman Empire would cease to exist. During the British Occupation much of the Kurdish population would revolt under Sheikh Mustafa Barzani, whose power base was in Suliamania in 1918, 1922-1924, including segments of the Jaff tribe. The British would end up destroying many Palaces and Fortresses built by the Kurds. Sherwana Castle was the exception, since the Brits had good relations with the Jaff. Exterior The Sherwana Castle sits on top of a mound two stories high, and has eight cases of nine steps each leading up to the entrance. The entrance is under a grand arched window with two narrow arched windows and two arched windows on each side. On each side of these are three more narrow long arched windows and three windows at the top. The back entrance is similar, with four narrow long windows on each side and four small windows at the top. Each of the four towers at the corners has three windows on all sides. The top one of these has no glass, to enable rifles to be placed on those positions. The roof of the castle has a building on top with four sides. There are six windows on each side and two windows on its corners, which protrude out in a hexagon shape. The roof of this building has a Persian appearance with wavy crenallations. Interior The inside has a monochromatic white appearance. The rooms are compartmentalized with many arches in which to put vases and tea sets. There are three stories with the second story containing lounge rooms by the grand windows above the entrances, which overlook all of Kalar. The top building contains mainly storage rooms.

It is molded to resemble a tortoise shell and is presented resting on a square piece of banana leaf. As suggested by its name, red tortoise cakes are traditionally red in color and has a sticky, chewy texture when eaten. Red tortoise cakes are shaped like tortoise shells because the Chinese traditionally believed that eating tortoises would bring longevity to those who are eating it and bring about good fortune and prosperity. Considered to be auspicious items, these sweet pastries are especially prepared during important festivals such as Chinese New Year as offerings to the Chinese deities. Red tortoise cakes are also prepared for occasions that are culturally important to the Chinese such as a newborn baby's first month or birthdays of the elderly. Eating red tortoise cakes during these times is meant to represent blessings for the child and longevity for the elderly. In modern times, red tortoise cakes continue to be important food items during Chinese festivals in many countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, China and Taiwan and southern Thailand provinces such as Phuket, Phang-Nga and Trang. However, eating red tortoise cakes in these countries is no longer restricted to special occasions for red tortoise cakes are also commercially available in many pastry shops and bakeries. There are two main components in red tortoise cakes, the skin and the filling. The skin is made mostly from glutinous rice flour and sweet potato whereas the fillings are made from precooked ingredients such as mung bean or ground peanuts and sugar. After kneading and molding the ingredients together, the red tortoise cakes are steamed on a piece of banana leaf. In countries such as Singapore and Malaysia, these pastries are popular snack items and are especially popular with children because of their sweet and savory taste. In fact, many bakeries in Singapore have created red tortoise cakes in a variety of assorted flavors, including jelly and red bean, to cater to all tastes and preferences. Importance in Chinese culture In Chinese culture, the color red is traditionally used as a symbol of joy and happiness whereas the tortoise symbolizes longevity, power and tenacity. As such, red tortoise cakes are of a high cultural significance and value amongst the Chinese people. They are typically associated with auspicious occasions and are especially prepared during birthdays and religious festivals to symbolize blessings and good fortune. =Chinese New Year= Chinese New Year is the most important festival in Chinese culture as it represents the start of a new year for everyone where people could reconcile and welcome the new year in hope for peace and prosperity. During this festival, the Chinese people would pray for good fortune and sweets such as rice cakes and red tortoise cakes are offered to the Chinese deities on ritual altars. These ritual offerings are made in the hope that the sweetness from these cakes will leave a sweet taste in the mouths of the deities and they will bless the people with a prosperous year ahead. =Jade Emperor's Birthday= The Jade Emperor is one of the most important gods in Chinese folklore. He is believed to be the ruler of heaven and his birthday falls on the ninth day of the first lunar month. To celebrate his birthday, the Chinese people will conduct prayers in his name and prepare food within Chinese temples or Chinese households as ritual offerings. In Chinese culture, red tortoise cakes are considered must-haves amongst the food items that are to be offered to the Jade Emperor on altar tables. Because the number 6 is considered an auspicious number in Chinese culture, red tortoise cakes are placed on the altar table in multiples of six such as 12, 24 or 36 in the hope that he will bless the people with good fortune and prosperity. =Qing Ming Festival= Qing Ming Festival is the time for the Chinese to visit the burial grounds of their ancestors to pay their respects. Prayers are conducted to honor the ancestors and food items such as red tortoise cakes are prepared as offerings. However, there is some difference in the red tortoise cakes that are prepared for this occasion. Apart from the usual red tortoise cakes that are prepared in the color red, there are separate red tortoise cakes that are prepared in the colors green or white. The reason for these differences in color between red tortoise cakes is that these colors are of cultural significance to the Chinese people. The color red is representative of the virtuous life led by the ancestors whereas the colors green and white embody the descendants' grief and their hope that their ancestors are coping well in the afterlife. =Qi Xi Festival= Qi Xi Festival falls on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month on the Chinese calendar. Also known as the Chinese Valentine's Day, the Qi Xi Festival is traditionally a time for young maidens to make wishes for a good husband. When a teenage girl reaches her sixteenth birthday, red tortoise cakes are prepared within the respective households and then handed out to close friends and neighbors. The symbolic act of handing out red tortoise cakes on this day signifies that one's daughter has reached maturity and is of a marriageable age. However, this practice is seldom carried out these days due to a change in cultural thoughts and beliefs amongst modern Chinese. =Birthdays= In Chinese culture, birthdays are of greater significance after one reaches the age of 60. Red tortoise cakes are prepared especially for such occasions when celebrating the birthdays of the elders in the family. The number of red tortoise cakes that are prepared corresponds to the age of the elder who is celebrating his or her birthday by an additional twelve. For example, if an elder is celebrating his 65th birthday, there will be 77 red tortoise cakes prepared to celebrate his or her birthday. The cultural significance of preparing these red tortoise cakes is to count one's blessings for having lived thus far and it is hoped that the additional 12 red tortoise cakes would increase one's lifespan, bringing longevity and good fortune in the process. =Newborn's first month= According to Chinese custom, when a baby turns one month old, a ceremony is held to celebrate his/her first month of life (the Chinese term translates as \\"full moon\\"). Red tortoise cakes are traditionally distributed to friends and relatives during this time to symbolize luck, blessings and long life for the child. In Hokkien tradition, the design on top of the \\"ang ku kueh\\" will signify the sex of the child. A turtle and two marbles is the sign for a boy while a girl is represented by two peaches. Nowadays, to simplify things, a ‚Äòpointed‚Äô \\"ang ku kueh\\" signifies a boy while a ‚Äòflat‚Äô one a girl. These tortoise cakes are sometimes made larger than usual in the hope that the child will grow up big and healthy. Availability Traditionally prepared during significant occasions such as festivals or birthdays, red tortoise cakes have become popular among many people who favor them as a delicious snack. Though many Chinese families these days continue to prepare red tortoise cakes within the household for special occasions, red tortoise cakes are available for sale all year in many bakeries and Chinese pastry shops. Because preparing red tortoise cakes is a time-consuming process, store-bought versions are also popular in China and across South-East Asia. Pastry chefs continue to introduce innovative interpretations of this traditional pastry into the market every year, appealing to consumers who enjoy the novelty of tasting these red tortoise cakes in assorted flavors. Preparation The skin of the red tortoise cake is made from glutinous rice flour dough, mashed sweet potato, water, food coloring, sugar, oil and wheat starch. Traditionally, fillings for red tortoise cakes are made with the following ingredients: mung bean paste or grounded peanuts, sugar and oil. The fillings are then placed within the dough and the tortoise shell design imprinted on the skin's surface using molds before the red tortoise cakes are steamed over a piece of banana leaf. The banana leaves enable the steam to penetrate the red tortoise cake that is resting on top and exudes a sweet fragrance when steamed. A good red tortoise cake is one where the skin does not stick to the teeth and exudes a sweet fragrance coupled with a soft chewy texture. Red tortoise cakes are traditionally made by: *Mixing and kneading the ingredients for the skin to form a dough *Cooking the ingredients used for the filling such as mung bean and peanut *Mashing the cooked ingredients together with sugar and oil to form a sweet paste *Flattening the dough into smaller rounded shapes *Placing a portion of the sweetened paste on the dough as filling before rolling the dough into a ball *Pressing the ball into a mold to create the iconic \\"tortoise shell\\" design *Steaming it over boiling water for 10 minutes on a piece of banana leaf *Brushing the cooked red tortoise cakes with oil to give the cakes a glossy shine on the surface =Red tortoise cake mold= Red tortoise cake molds are an important tool when making red tortoise cakes. Apart from molding the red tortoise cakes into perfectly round or oval shapes, these molds are also used to imprint patterns onto the surfaces of the red tortoise cakes. Usually carved out of wood or molded from plastics, there are many different types of red tortoise cake molds available on the market. There are also red tortoise molds that create floral patterns instead of the tortoise shell pattern seen on traditional red tortoise cakes. These molds are used to enhance the aesthetic value of red tortoise cakes and there is no cultural significance attached to the differing designs on these molds. Varieties Many bakeries and pastry shops have added new twists to the traditional red tortoise cake and found ways to introduce innovative and creative variants of this pastry. In Singapore, apart from the usual fillings of peanut or mung bean paste, there are now red tortoise cakes filled with exotic flavors such as durian and coconut amongst many others. Catered to suit all tastes and preferences, these new products on the market bear testament to the popularity of red tortoise cakes among consumers. Among the Peranakans it is known as Kueh Ku or Ang Ku Kueh. The black variant is known as Kueh Ku Hitam. =Jelly red tortoise cake= Though it looks exactly like the traditional red tortoise cake physically, jelly red tortoise cake is significantly different from its traditional counterpart. Instead of a skin that is made from glutinous rice flour, jelly red tortoise cakes have skins that are made of sweetened gelatin. The gelatin mixture along with fillings such as cream or custard are poured into plastic moulds and then refrigerated to enable the gelatin mixture to set and harden.

It was released on July 12, 2011 in North America and July 15, 2011 in Europe for Windows, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360. It is based on the film of the same name. The game continues to follow Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger on their quest to defeat Lord Voldemort by destroying his remaining Horcruxes, items which contain part of his soul. Critics reviewed the game negatively for its gameplay, but claimed the game was an improvement over the first installment. Gameplay The gameplay of Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 2 differs from Part 1, in order to address complaints made with the previous game. The game progresses linearly, through cutscenes, but does not include side missions like the previous game. Combat in Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 2 involves button presses which initiates spell- casting as an attack. Three face buttons, usually with a symbol or a letter, on the controller have two spells each, and by pressing a button twice the player can access the button's second spell. For the Windows version, the player presses one of the six buttons to select a spell. A new feature is the ability to \\"Apparate\\", which allows the player to teleport in and out of battles, as a form of defence. Only Harry has this ability though. The player is able to control several characters from a third person over-the-shoulder camera including Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, Minerva McGonagall, Seamus Finnigan, Ginny Weasley and Molly Weasley. In the final battle, the player uses the directional buttons to move the beam and focus it on Voldemort. Development Part 2 of the video game was released to coincide with the release of the second part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. EA released a teaser in their Facebook page on April 21 and released the Part 2 video game site on the same day. Release On 8 May 2011, EA revealed the game covers for all the major platforms. The cover depicts the trio, surrounded by fellow Hogwarts students, and Death Eaters, and a destroyed Hogwarts in flames in the background. Part 2 is the first Harry Potter video game to feature PlayStation Move functionality. On 26 May 2011, six new images from the game surfaced online along with a new interview with IGN. The images included, duels between the core characters, and the Hogwarts castle itself, under severe stress. On 21 April 2011, Emma Watson released the first trailer. On 1 June 2011, Rupert Grint released a new trailer, showing all the playable characters. Later, a second new trailer was presented showing the tagline \\"War is Coming\\" and \\"The Battle for Hogwarts\\". On July, before the film release, the launch trailer was released. Reception Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 2 received mixed to negative reviews from critics, though some critics found Part 2 an improvement of Part 1. Lowest ratings on Metacritic came from GamesRadar, stating, \\"This is the absolute nadir of the series. Harry Potter has finally devolved into a total cash-in and we can't score it low enough.\\" GamingXP gave the Xbox 360 and PC versions positive reviews, saying \\"Where graphical aesthetics, thrilling atmosphere and a cinematic soundtrack celebrate their marriage, the gamer always wins.\\" The Escapist gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five and said of the game, \\"The shooting mechanics and levels are getting better but the encounters themselves are too repetitive. I hope someone takes the basic idea and does something more with it. The absence of basic storytelling and scene transitions make it hard to enjoy on its own.\\" Digital Spy gave it two stars out of five and said, \\"The gameplay remains a weak imitation of a third- person shooter and the enemy A.I. is extremely poor. The lack of variety in the set pieces and the sheer number of dopey Death Eaters makes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 a tedious experience, riddled with repetition.\\" The Daily Telegraph also gave it a score of four out of ten and called it \\"a bland, unimaginative shooting gallery that lacks the thing that matters most: magic.\\" References External links  Category:2011 video games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Warner Bros.

The siege was in retaliation for the French and Indian Siege of Pemaquid (1696) at present day Bristol, Maine. In the English Province of Massachusetts Bay. Colonel John Hathorne and Major Benjamin Church were the leaders of the New England force of 400 men. The siege lasted two days, between October 18‚Äì20, 1696, and formed part of a larger expedition by Church against a number of other Acadian communities.  Historical context  During King William's War - the first of the four French and Indian Wars - French and Indians were victorious in the Siege of Pemaquid (1696) (present day Bristol, Maine) earlier that year. In the Siege of Pemaquid, the French and Indians had destroyed Fort William Henry, which the English colonial militia leader Benjamin Church himself assisted in erecting. In response to the defeat, the following month Benjamin Church led a devastating raid on Chignecto and then laid siege to the capital of Acadia, Fort Nashwaak in 1696. Fort Nashwaak was a four-sided log palisade erected by Governor Villebon in 1691-92, who had decided to relocate the capital from Fort Jemseg as he felt a setting further up river would be safer from attack. Called by Villebon Fort St. Joseph, it was located on the north bank of the Nashwaak River at its junction with the Saint John River. The site offered the additional strategic benefits to Villebon of being situated near the Maliseet capital of Meductic and of being on a traditional portage route.Webster, John Clarence. Acadia at the End of the Seventeenth Century. Saint John, NB, The New Brunswick Museum, 1979. P. 11  Saint John River  First informed on October 1 by Sieur Chevalier that an English brig had entered the harbour at Saint John, Villebon sent Sieur Neuvillette, on October 5 with seven men, to reconnoiter the lower confines of the river and to carry supplies to Sieur Chevalier. On October 9, Neuvillette sent word back to Fort Nashwaak that six English vessels had entered the harbour at Saint John and landed two hundred English and Indian troops after successfully attacking Sieur Chevalier. On October 12, Neuvillette fell back to Fort Nashwaak and on the way picked up seven or eight French soldiers rescued by the Indians at Fort Nerepis (later known as Fort Boishebert) which was under attack by the English forces.Webster, John Clarence. Acadia at the End of the Seventeenth Century. Saint John, NB, The New Brunswick Museum, 1979 The English continued their cautious approach and on October 16 were spotted by Sieur Neuvillette a short distance below Jemseg. Governor Villebon having been alerted, had prepared his defences. Several days earlier, on October 11, Governor Villebon, made a request to Father Simon-G√©rard de La Place to gather Maliseet militia from Meductic to defend the fort from an attack. On October 16, Father Simon and Acadian Sieur de Clignancourt led 36 Maliseet militia members to Nashwaak to defend Fort Nashawaak. In further preparation to defend his position, Villebon cleared his field of fire by dismantling a house, hid surplus powder in hidden caches, and assigned his men to their positions.  Siege  On October 18 the English troops arrived opposite the fort, landed three cannons (two being used with some effect with the third unable to function effectively as it had been positioned too close, taking heavy musket fire from Villebon's forces) and assembled earthworks on the south bank of the Nashwaak River.near where the Fort Nashwaak Motel now stands Baptiste was there to defend the capital, having arrived at the Fort on Oct 17 with ten Saint John River Acadian settlers. Baptiste joined the Maliseet from Meductic for the duration of the siege. There was a fierce exchange of cannon fire for two days, with the advantage going to the better sited French guns. In addition to the opposing cannonades, Sr. Clignancourt and Sr. Baptiste with the Mi'kmaq allies confronted a force of English allied Indians advancing along the Nashwaak River. On the second day of the siege at about noon M. de Falaise arrived from Quebec and immediately placed his arms against the English. The French were able to knock out one English cannon and slow the English fire of the last cannon due to continuous fire from the fort. The New Englanders were defeated (having suffered 8 killed and 17 wounded) and evacuated their position, retreating down the river. The French harassed the English retreat, keeping up musket fire and making them believe the Indians were following them.Webster, John Clarence. Acadia at the End of the Seventeenth Century. Saint John, NB, The New Brunswick Museum, 1979. The French lost one killed and two wounded including Mathieu d'Amours.  Aftermath  In response to Church's failed siege, Acadian Rene d'Amour of Aukpacque and Father Simon-G√©rard accompanied an expedition of the Maliseet militia, which, although one of the largest gatherings of natives ever assembled in Acadia, did not, after all, accomplish very much. By withdrawing from the Siege of Fort Nashwaak, the British gave up two small boats. Baptiste used them to head to Grand Pre. While in Grand Pre he armed the vessels and recruited Acadian crew members to make a descent on the coast of New England. In March 1697 Baptiste had captured eight English fishing vessels within three leagues of Casco Bay. Bapiste was injured three times in the raid, however, he was able to capture the vessels and took many prisoners. Two New England privateer ships arrived at the scene but Baptiste was able to beat them back and safely return to Grand Pre with his prizes. Church threatened the Acadians at Chignecto before leaving that he would return if more New Englanders suffered. He did return to raid Chignecto again during Queen Anne's War in a campaign against Acadia that also included the Raid on Grand Pre. Two years later the capital of Acadia moved briefly to Saint John and then returned to Port Royal, Nova Scotia.

The first scandal began when Weiner was a Democratic U.S. Congressman. He used the social media website Twitter to send a link that contained a sexually suggestive picture of himself to a 21-year-old woman. After initially denying reports that he had posted the image, he admitted that he sent a link to the photo, which was described by Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as an \\"erection barely covered by a man's underwear\\" and by iPolitics as a \\"man-bulge in boxer briefs\\". He also sent additional sexually explicit photos and messages to women before and during his marriage. He denied ever having met or having had a physical relationship with any of the women. On June 16, 2011, Weiner announced his intention to resign from Congress effective June 23. Weiner returned to politics in April 2013 when he entered the New York City mayoral race. After additional pictures of Weiner were released, Weiner admitted sexting at least three women since his resignation from Congress. He remained in the race until the end, placing fifth in the Democratic primary. Following a report from the Daily Mail in September 2016, the FBI investigated Weiner for sexting with a 15-year-old girl. His laptop was seized and emails related to the Hillary Clinton email controversy were found on it, causing a controversy late in the presidential election. On May 19, 2017, Weiner pled guilty to one count of transferring obscene material to a minor. His wife, Huma Abedin, filed for divorce prior to Weiner's guilty plea. In September, he was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison. He served his sentence at Federal Medical Center, Devens, in Ayer, Massachusetts. Initial media reports and Weiner's denial On May 27, 2011, Weiner used his public Twitter account to send a link to a photo on yfrog. The picture of his erect penis concealed by boxer briefs was sent to a 21-year-old female college student from Seattle, Washington, who was following his posts on the social media website. Though the link was quickly removed from Weiner's Twitter account, screen shots of Weiner‚Äôs original message and of the photo were captured by a user identified as \\"Dan Wolfe\\" on Twitter and subsequently sent to blogger Andrew Breitbart who published them on his BigGovernment website the following day. CNN described it as a \\"lewd photograph\\" of a \\"man bulge in ... underwear\\". On June 1, 2011, Weiner gave a series of interviews in which he denied sending the photo and suggested that someone, perhaps a political opponent, had hacked into his accounts and published the photo. Weiner also said he could not say \\"with certitude\\" that the photo was not of him. He suggested that the image might be doctored, saying, \\"Maybe it did start being a photo of mine and now looks something different or maybe it is from another account.\\" He did not ask the FBI or U.S. Capitol Police to investigate the incident but said he had retained a private security firm to look into this matter because he felt it was a prank, not a crime. Several bloggers accused Wolfe and Breitbart of planting the photo and message as part of a scheme to defame Weiner.The Man Behind Weiner's Resignation ; National Journal; Amanda Mu√±oz-Temple; June 16, 2011 Evidence later revealed that a group of self-described conservatives had been monitoring Weiner's communications with women for at least three months. Two false identities of underage girls had been created by unknown parties to solicit communication with Weiner and the women he was contacting. Bloggers reported a tweet made in April by a 17-year-old Delaware girl in which she exclaimed, \\"Seriously talking to Representative Weiner from New York right now! Like is my life real?\\" In early June, Fox News Channel, whose reporter \\"happened to be there when the cops showed up\\", reported that police went to the girl's house to question her and her parents. The police, who had been \\"made aware of an alleged contact\\" between Weiner and the girl, also reviewed content on her computer. Weiner confirmed having communicated with the girl, but denied sending any inappropriate messages. The family of the girl stated the contact was \\"not salacious or in any manner inappropriate\\". The police did not find anything wrong in Weiner's communications with the girl.Weiner‚Äôs 17-year-old Twitter contact responds; CNN; June 12, 2011 The entire incident was later dubbed \\"Weinergate.\\" =Admission= On June 6, Breitbart posted a cropped, shirtless picture of Weiner that was obtained from a second woman on the Internet, and said that Weiner had sent more pictures of himself, including at least one that was sexually graphic. After this information had been made public, Weiner held a press conference in New York and apologized, saying, \\"I have not been honest with myself, my family, my constituents, my friends and supporters, and the media\\" and that, \\"to be clear, the picture was of me, and I sent it.\\" After being prompted by reporters, he specifically apologized to Andrew Breitbart. He also said he had \\"engaged in several inappropriate conversations conducted over Twitter, Facebook, email and occasionally on the phone\\" and had exchanged \\"messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years\\". He added he had never met or had a physical relationship with any of them. He said he was \\"deeply ashamed\\" of his \\"terrible judgment and actions\\", which he called \\"very dumb.\\" When Weiner answered questions, he said that he had the continuing support of his wife Huma Abedin, who was a long-time aide to Hillary Clinton. He had married Abedin in July 2010 in a ceremony officiated by Bill Clinton, and he said that he did not intend to resign his congressional seat. Prior to his marriage, Weiner was known for his \\"bachelor exploits with some of New York's most eligible women,\\" detailed in a 2011 Moment profile of the Congressman. Following the revelations of his inappropriate communications, his reportedly emotional apology to former president Clinton was referred to in the press as highly ironic. Asked about an allegation that he had engaged in phone sex with a woman in Nevada, Weiner neither confirmed nor denied the statement, saying that though he did not want to impinge the privacy of any of the women, neither would he contradict any of their statements. At his press conference, Weiner did admit that he had exchanged the reported sexting messages with his accuser. =Later events= During an appearance on Sirius XM radio on June 8, 2011, Breitbart showed hosts Opie and Anthony a photograph of what he claimed to be Weiner's nude genitalia. One of the cameras in the room caught the cell phone's display, and the hosts subsequently leaked the photo by publishing it on Twitter. Breitbart stated that the photo was published without his permission, and later told KFI radio, \\"These people have admitted that they did this surreptitiously and illicitly and they lied in the process saying that they didn't even have a camera in the place.\\" Weiner's spokesperson issued the following statement: \\"As Representative Weiner said on Monday when he took responsibility for his actions, he has sent explicit photos.\\" News media also reported the identity of other Weiner's social media contacts, Lisa Weiss, a 40-year-old blackjack dealer in Las Vegas, and 28-year-old porn actress Ginger Lee who had exchanged sexually oriented messages with Weiner. On June 15, Ginger Lee held a press conference during which she said that when she requested advice from Weiner on how to respond to the media, he had advised her on June 2 that if they both stayed quiet the scandal would die down. =Political and constituent reaction= On the afternoon of June 6, 2011, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called for an investigation by the House Ethics Committee to determine \\"whether any official resources were used or any other violation of House rules occurred\\". A number of Democratic and Republican congressmen called for Weiner's resignation. On June 7, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called for him to resign, and challenged Pelosi to suggest the same. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R, VA) said he should resign, opining: \\"The last thing we need is to be immersed in discussion about Congressman Weiner and his Twitter activities.\\" House Democrats who called for him to resign on June 8 included Representatives Allyson Schwartz (PA), Mike Ross (AR), Mike Michaud (ME), Niki Tsongas (MA), Larry Kissell (NC) and Joe Donnelly (IN). On June 11, Nancy Pelosi, DCCC Chair Steve Israel, and DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz called for Weiner's resignation. Weiner requested and was granted a short leave of absence from the House to obtain professional treatment of an unspecified nature. Two June 6 surveys of New York City adult residents provided conflicting results. A TV station NY1 and Marist College poll indicated that 51% believed Weiner should remain in Congress, 30% thought he should step down, and 18% were unsure. A WABC-TV/SurveyUSA automated survey found the city divided, with 46 percent who thought he should resign and 41 percent who thought he should stay in office. On June 9, a NY1-Marist Poll showed that 56% of registered voters in Weiner's Congressional District wanted him to stay in Congress, and 33% thought he should resign, with 12% uncertain. In the same poll, 73% said he acted unethically, but not illegally. On June 13, White House spokesman Jay Carney said \\"The president feels... this is a distraction, as Congressman Weiner has said himself, his behavior was inappropriate; dishonesty was inappropriate.\\" President Barack Obama said in an interview later that day that if he were Weiner, he would resign. =Resignation= On June 16, 2011, Weiner announced he would resign his seat in Congress. He made the announcement at a news conference in Brooklyn, at the same location where he announced his first campaign for New York City Council in 1992.See: \\"New York Rep. Anthony Weiner resigns\\", NBC News; retrieved June 16, 2011.  On June 20, Weiner formally submitted his letter of resignation from the U.S. House of Representatives, effective at midnight on June 21. (scan of letter of resignation at this link) His letter of resignation was read on the floor of the House of Representatives on June 23 and entered into the record.See: (video link) * In a special election held on September 13, 2011 to fill the vacant seat, the Republican candidate, businessman Bob Turner, defeated the Democratic candidate, State Assemblyman David Weprin.Republican Wins House Race in New York, Seen as Obama Rebuke, foxnews.com, September 14, 2011; accessed August 29, 2016. 2013 mayoral race and second scandal In April 2013, the former congressman announced his return to politics as candidate for mayor of New York City. He soon became the front runner against Democratic primary-opponent City Council Speaker Christine Quinn. On July 23, 2013, more pictures and sexting allegedly by Weiner were released by the website The Dirty. They were allegedly sent under the alias \\"Carlos Danger\\" to a 22-year- old woman named with whom Weiner had contact in late 2012, as late as April 2013, more than a year after Weiner left Congress. The woman's identity had yet to be confirmed. At a news conference that same day, with his wife Huma by his side, Weiner responded, \\"I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out, and today they have.\\" He also said he would not drop out of the mayoral election for the City of New York. On July 24 Weiner's sexting partner's identity was confirmed as Sydney Leathers on CNN by a personal friend. Later The New York Times print edition called for Weiner to withdraw from the mayoral race in an editorial titled \\"Mr. Weiner and the Elusive Truth\\". In a joint NBC 4 New York/The Wall Street Journal/Marist Institute for Public Opinion poll taken that day, Weiner's favorability rating had dropped over 20 points, and he had lost the lead in the primary race to councilor Quinn, now leading him 25 to 16 percent. On July 25, the New York Daily News reported that, at a news conference in Brooklyn that day, Weiner admitted that he had sexted with three women in the months after his resignation from Congress, and that there had been six to ten women involved in total, not \\"dozens and dozens\\". Weiner‚Äôs campaign manager Danny Kedem quit the weekend after the news conference. Following the primary election on September 10, 2013, the press reported that Sydney Leathers, the young woman at the center of the second scandal, attempted to enter Weiner's campaign party that night, without an invitation. Weiner lost decisively in the election, finishing in fifth place with 4.9% of the vote. Criminal conviction and divorce On August 28, 2016, the New York Post reported that Weiner had engaged in sexting with another woman, including sending one picture in July 2015 while lying in bed with his toddler son sleeping next to him. The New York Times reported the next day that Weiner and his wife intended to separate. Weiner had served as a contributor to NY1, which put him on indefinite leave. On September 21, 2016, the Daily Mail published an article claiming that Weiner had engaged in sexting with a 15-year-old girl. It's not known how the Daily Mail learned of this incident as in the Daily Mail article the girl's father says he did not contact the police and this article was used as reason for the FBI and NYPD to begin investigating Weiner. Devices owned by Weiner and Abedin were seized as part of the investigation into this incident. Emails pertinent to the Hillary Clinton email controversy were discovered on Weiner's laptop, prompting FBI Director James Comey to reopen that investigation late into the 2016 US presidential election. Hillary Clinton has cited Comey's decision as one reason why she lost the election to Donald Trump. On January 31, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors were weighing whether to bring child pornography charges against Weiner over the incident. On May 19, 2017, The New York Times reported Weiner had surrendered to the FBI that morning, and under a plea bargain he intended to plead guilty to a single charge of transferring obscene material to a minor. Abedin reportedly filed for divorce prior to his guilty plea. On September 25, 2017, Judge Denise Cote of the Southern District of New York agreed to a plea agreement sentence totaling 21 months in federal prison, three years supervised release, and for Weiner to register as a sex offender. Weiner reported to Federal Medical Center, Devens on November 6. He was released from prison on February 17, 2019, and was ordered to register as a sex offender in April that year. In popular culture The first scandal was used as the inspiration for part of the plot line of Season I-II of the Showtime series Homeland, where a protagonist, a war hero (played by Damian Lewis), is invited to run for Congress (and subsequently gets elected) after the political career of \\"Congressman Dick Johnson\\" comes to a sudden end after his sexting pictures are publicized. An article in The Washington Post, noting that the Weiner story broke just in time for script purposes, quotes Alex Gansa, co-creator of Homeland: \\"We were looking for a way that our lead character could become a congressman in a very quick period of time. This presented itself on a platter.\\"\\"'Homeland': Does it get Washington right?\\", The Washington Post, November 15, 2011.

Some books, such as Voyage to America, 1783‚Äì1785 by Grigoriƒ≠ Ivanovich Shelikhov (Alaska History no. 19, 1981), required decades of work. This book originated in 1958, with a letter received from Hector Chevigny, author of the popular Alaskan historical works Lost Empire, on N. P. Rezanov, and Lord of Alaska, on Alexander Andreyevich Baranov. Chevigny had planned to write yet a third book on another notable person in the history of Russian America, Grigoriƒ≠ Shelikhov, until loss of eyesight forced him to lay the project aside. Pierce described his cooperation with Chevigny in the following way:Pierce‚Äôs preface to Voyage to America, 1783‚Äì1785 by Grigoriƒ≠ Ivanovich Shelikhov, Alaska History no. 19, 1981. Another book that was a result of decades of work was Pierce's Russian America, 1741‚Äì1867, A Biographical Dictionary, published in 1990 (Alaska History no. 33). In April 2001, he along with fellow anthropologist and historian and close colleague Lydia T.

The game is part of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon series. On August 25, 2016, Ubisoft announced that it would shut down Phantoms' servers on December 1, 2016, due to \\"a slow but steady decline in users\\". Gameplay Ghost Recon Phantoms has three classes: Assault, Recon, and Support. It has a team-based gameplay, so each of these classes synergizes with one another. The Assault is played as a suppressor that can charge its way in, the Recon can outflank enemies using a cloak device or snipe by using a scanning device, and the Support can manipulate the battlefield by generating an electronic shield or causing a temporary blackout. There are four match types: Private Match, Team Capture, Team Death match, Clan Match and three game modes: Conquest, Onslaught, and Holdout. Development Ghost Recon Phantoms was previously known as Ghost Recon Online during the beta phase. =Wii U version= On 24 May 2011, Ubisoft announced that its Singapore studio would develop Ghost Recon Online for the latter half of 2011, following an initial closed beta. This game is supported by micro transactions. On 7 June 2011, Nintendo announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo that Ubisoft would release the game for the Wii U. Also, Ubisoft presented trailers and demos for the Wii U version of the game. The Windows version is confirmed to be a free-to-play game, and requires a Uplay account. Whilst not officially confirmed to be a free-to-play model as well for the Wii U , Nintendo's then president and CEO Satoru Iwata commented in an interview that he has no opposition against this model and is willing to work with it. Despite the fact the Wii U version of the game was not presented during either Ubisoft's or Nintendo's conferences at E3 2012, Ubisoft reaffirms that the game is still coming to Wii U. According to Ubisoft's senior vice president of sales and marketing Tony Key, he says that \\"Ghost Recon Online is being developed for the PC first. That was always the plan. The team is taking a little bit longer than they thought they would to get Ghost Recon Online to the level and quality that they want and that definitely has had an impact on how much time they're able to spend on the Wii U version because we want to make sure we get it right.\\" Key also states that much of the development team behind the Wii U version of the game are also working on the PC version, and that focus will shift to the Wii U once the PC version is completed. Additionally, Key also says, \\"If we start working on the Wii U too soon, we might end up wasting a lot of resources because the PC is a lot easier to test and learn with. Ghost Recon Online on the PC, we can test and learn with that and apply all the best benefits we learn onto the Wii U version to make sure that it's a great Wii U game. That's an unusual product for a console and we want to make sure we nail it.\\" On 6 September 2012, the game's producer stated that \\"as of right now, the entire Ghost Recon team is focused on the PC version only\\" and that \\"the Wii U version is on hold\\". Reception Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Phantoms received an aggregate score of 70 at Metacritic indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". IGN also gave mixed positive reviews with a score of 7.5 out of 10. Lief Johnson from IGN said \\"It may seem a little strange to see Ubisoft releasing a free-to-play installment of the long-running Ghost Recon series so soon after May‚Äôs release of Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, but here it is\\" as of being surprised to see a free-to-play game by Ubisoft. There were more than a thousand U.S. dollars worth of DLC, making this game the most expensive one released by Ubisoft.

Temple's Speciality  The presiding deity is a swayambumurthi. On 3rd, 4th and 5th days of Masi (February‚ÄìMarch) the rays of setting Sun fall on the deity. During the setting time, the rays will fall on the deity from foot to the face. Lord Dhandayuthapani graces here with hair in His head. The idol is 4 feet tall holding a sugarcane with 11 parting lines called kanukkal, a form nowhere available in Muruga temples. Opening Time:The temple is open from 6.00 a.m. to 11.00 and 4.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m. Address:Sri Dhandayuthapani Temple, Chettikulam, Perambalur district. Phone:+91-4328 268 008, 99441 17450, 98426 99378  General Information  The temple has 240 steps to mount on and 243 steps to come down. The speciality of the temple is that Lord Muruga faces the other Chettikulam temple belonging to His father Lord Shiva. The chief of Muruga‚Äôs army, Veerabagu graces here as Veerabadraswami. Prayers People pray here for happy wedlocks, child boon, for remedy from illness and other physical problems, favourable results in litigations, recovery of things lost, trade problems etc. and they strongly believe that Lord Muruga offers just solutions. The other natural advantage is that devotees go by steps to the temple breathing the healthy herbal breeze. Thanks giving: Tonsuring, carrying Kavadi, offering things equal to their weight (Tulabaram), contributing cattle are the prayer commitments followed by devotees. Those getting the child boon realized, make cradles of sugarcane and tie them in the temple. Some offer Vel ‚Äì the weapon of Lord Muruga- made of silver and offer it to the Lord. Abishek is offered in milk, curd, green coconut, lime fruits, sandal, panchamirtham made of five ingredients, oil etc. They perform Kalasabishekam (kalasa-small metal pots) on Sashti days ‚Äì 6th day either from new moon or full moon days. Shanmuga Homa is devotionally performed by devotees. Feeding the visitors and usual abisheks are also performed by devotees.  Greatness Of Temple  Lord Muruga in Dhandayuthapani form has tonsured head in all temples. Against this established principle, Lord Dhandayuthapani in this temple appears in a beautiful hair style. He is 4 feet tall holding a sugarcane with 11 partition lines. This is the only temple where devotees can have this darshan. Chettikulam: Lord Muruga granted darshan to Sage Againsthya as a bangle seller called Valayal Chetty. (Valayal-Bangle, Chetti- trader). Lord Muruga is also said to have guided Paranthaka Chola and Kulasekhara Pandiya and helped them quell the fury of Kannaki and calm her in the form of Madhurakali. The place is also known as Vadapalani as Lord Muruga graces in a form as in Palani in south. The significance lies in the Lord‚Äôs swayambumurthi form. He is holding a red sugarcane, an exclusive form here only. The Panchanadhi River is always full of water. The rain water flows into the river through the herbal plants on the hill and has all medicinal properties. The prayer commitments to Palani can be executed here. Sage Agasthya worshipped here. Saint Arunagiriar had praised the temple in his hymns.  Temple History  The Devas appealed to Lord Shiva in Kailash to protect them from the terrorism of the demons. Mother Parvathi was also present in the court. Lord Muruga rose up and promised to destroy them and got the Shakti weapon called Vel from His Mother. He returns to his Mother to announce his victory over the demons and the destruction of their chief Sura. As a token of Her congratulations to the victorious son, She gave the sugarcane held by Her. Lord Muruga came to this temple with this sugarcane. Lord Ganesha temple at the entrance was rebuilt in the year 2008 by Mr M.Ramasamy Additional Inspector General of Registration (Retd) and his wife Shakunthala Ramasamy .

Siruvachur is located at a distance of 5 km from Perambalur, its nearest town. The Car festival and the annual Panguni festivals are important festivals celebrated. History  The place where the temple was constructed is believed to be the place where Kannagi, the idol of the Tamil epic Silappatikaram, reassured herself after returning from Madurai. According to tradition, Chelliamman was a local deity of Siruvachur. Her powers became delimited by a tantric, who started using the powers and for destructive purposes. Kannagi came across this Devi temple at Siruvachur and decided to rest there for the night. During her stay, Chelliamman revealed her servitude, and Kannagi did away with the Tantric and saved Chelliamman. Kannagi now received the name as Mathura Kaliamman, as she is from Madurai & got rid of the tantric with the blessings of Kali. Chelliamman, as a gesture of gratitude and also in order to greet Mathura Kaliamman, moved to the Periaswamimali, a nearby hillock, requesting the latter to stay in Siruvachur to which Mathura Kaliamman accepted with a suggestion that the initial offerings shall be presented to her (Chelliamman). The temple is about 1000 years old. Deities The prime deity is Mathura Kaliamman. The temple is open to devotees only twice a week ‚Äì Monday and Friday. It is believed that the main deity, Mathura Kaliamman, stays with Chelliamman during the remaining days of the week. Festivals A Car festival is held annually during the month of May. During the festival, the idol of goddess Mathura Kaliamman is brought from the shrine to the car where rituals are performed. The car-festival is a part of the annual festival that is celebrated for a period of 13 days. A yearly Mahabishekam to the Deity has been performed since 1974 by Sri Mathurakaliamman Mahabhisheha Association(a registered autonomous body). This Mahabishekam is performed during the last Friday of Tamil month \\"Thai\\".  Places to Stay  * Hotel Temple In - Boarding & Lodging.

Its main tributaries are the Pechenga (right) and Uftyuga (left). The Kokshenga begins from the confluence of the Ileza (right) and the Kortyuga (left) close to the village of Ivanovskaya of Tarnogsky District. The river flows west, accepts a major tributary, the Pechenga River, from the north, and turns south-west. In the rural locality (selo) of Tarnogsky Gorodok, the district center of Tarnogsky District, it accepts the Tarnoga from the left, and sharply turns north-west. Several kilometers downstream of Tarnogsky Gorodok it accepts the Uftyuga River from the left. Downstream of Tarnogsky Gorodok, the valley of the Kokshenga is heavily populated. The river enters the Arkhangelsk Oblast, crosses the corner of the Ustyansky District, and enters the Velsky District. It then crosses the railway line connecting Konosha and Kotlas close to Kokshenga railway station.

The fort is located north of Perambalur in NH 45 in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is located away from the state capital Chennai and from Trichy.The fort was constructed by Vijayanagar Nayaka Kings. Then occupied by Nawab of the Carnatic. Ranjakudi fort was the focus point during the Battle of Valikondah during 1751, when the British troops supported by Mohammed Ali won over the French supported by Chanda Sahib. The fort is oblong in shape with semicircular bastions, a moat encircling it and three fortifications at different levels, built with cut stone blocks. The fort has a palace, residence buildings, underground chamber and an underground passage that links Pettai (the top level) with Kottai Medu (lower level). The fort, in modern times, is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India. The fort is one of the prominent tourist destinations in Perambalur. History thumb The fort is called Ranjankudikottai and also referred as Nanjankudikottai. The old premises is believed to have been housing Hindu temples dedicated to Shiva and Hanuman. The fort is believed to have been constructed by Vijayanagar Nayaka Kings. Then it was occupied by the Nawab of Carnatic during the 17th century. The fort was the scene of the Battle of Valikondah during 1751. The British troops were supported by Mohammed Ali while the French were supported by Chanda Sahib. Though the battle is called by the nearby village Valikondah, it was fought in the fort. While the French won the initial battle, the British ended up winning the final battle with the help of local Muslims. In May 1752, the fort was also the scene of surrender of French troops under D'Auteuil, which was sent to relieve the garrison at Srirangam. D'Auteuil was posted in Uttatur and was fended off by the British troops led by Dalton on 9 May. He retreated to Ranjankudi, where the Jagirthar took the side of the British and denied entry to the French troops to the upper level of the fort. D'Auteuil surrendered in the fort. The fort was located in a strategic position during the colonial times, away from the Tiruchirappalli Rockfort. The fort, in modern times, is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India. Architecture The fort is located north of Perambalur in NH 45 in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is located away from the state capital Chennai and from Trichy. The fort is oblong in shape with semicircular bastions and a moat encircling it. There are three fortifications at different levels, built by Vijaya nagar Nayak kings with cut stone blocks. The lower bastion is the main rampart surrounded by mud wall. The open ground known as Pettai is approached through a flight of steps, which was once a battlefield. The top- tier is called Kottai Medu, used as guarding towers by soldiers and housing cannons. The small water body in the fort is believed to have been used by the Nawab as swimming pool. The fort has a palace, residence buildings, underground chamber and an underground passage that links Pettai with Kottai Medu. The pit in the centre of the fort was used as a prison for male prisoners while female prisoners were jailed in small blocks inside the fort. As per J. Raja Mohamed, an epigraphist and former curator of Government Museum, the fort culminated Mughal Architecture in the region . It is also believed that he introduced cotton cultivation in the region, which is continued in modern times. The fort is one of the prominent tourist destinations in Perambalur.

History The law firm of Herbert Geer was founded on 26 January 1939 when Keith Geer commenced his sole practice in Bank Place, off Collins Street, Melbourne. After the disruption of the Second World War, Keith Geer resumed his practice and was joined in 1946 by Geoffrey Herbert, who continued to operate from his office in Black Rock. The firm was known as Herbert & Geer and was largely a conveyancing practice. In 1950 the partnership expanded further with the addition of Eric Rundle and in 1960 it assumed the name, Herbert Geer & Rundle. In 1962 the Melbourne office relocated to 113 William Street, taking with it a total of ten partners and staff and three residents in the office at Black Rock. At about this time the firm purchased an office in Niddrie at the request of the Bank of New South Wales, for professional expansion in this area. This office was sold in 1988. Between 1962 and 1970, three small practices were absorbed into Herbert Geer & Rundle; Farmer & Ramsay, Williams & Matthews and the office of Cyril Brooks. Many clients from these three firms are still associated with the firm today. The firm achieved publicity in the early 1970s by handling the defendant‚Äôs litigation for all workers' compensation claims arising from the Westgate bridge collapse. Further office relocations occurred with moves to Owen Dixon Chambers and BHP House before arriving at the State Bank Building in 1983. At that time the firm comprised 35 persons and was well known for its strong commercial practice focusing on tax. The prominent partners were then Leon Gorr, David Geer and Tom May. In July 1985 the firm took the pivotal step of acquiring an insurance litigation practice of 11 persons led by Richard Mole. By 1989 Herbert Geer & Rundle had one of the largest insurance practices in Victoria. The firm had 12 partners and 110 staff. The commercial lawyer Greg Basser joined the firm and developed a large and strong practice. The decade commencing in 1990 was considered to be the halcyon period for the firm. Many concluded that in financial terms the firm was the most profitable in Australia. In April 1999, Richard Mole for the firm opened a Sydney office and expanded to Brisbane in early 2001. Some key partners, including Basser, left the firm early in the next decade but it was in 2006 when Herbert Geer & Rundle suffered near fatal wounds. Five litigation partners, including Richard Mole left the firm. Further, David Geer retired and Andrew Newbold resigned. In 2008 the firm rebranded as Herbert Geer and, in the absence of organic growth, sought mergers. It joined with Brisbane firm Nicol Robinson Halletts Lawyers, as well as the boutique construction firm RDK in Sydney. Herbert Geer acted for iiNet Limited, an Australian ISP, in its defence of a landmark Federal Court claim and subsequent appeal brought by a group of major film studios alleging that iiNet had authorised copyright infringements by its subscribers,\\"Herbert Geer's win for iiNet\\" Lawyers Weekly 8 February 2011 and in successfully arguing the matter of Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission[2010] HCA 1 in the High Court.

There has been ongoing cooperation and dialogue in regional and international issues since the 2010s, particularly in the Syrian Civil War and the Egyptian Crisis. Both countries also support the same groups in post- Gaddafi Libya. Most recently, Turkey provided diplomatic and food support to Qatar during the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis. Some political analysts claim that bilateral relations are mostly limited to political and military affinity, referring to the low trade volume, lack of trade agreements and absence of Turkish think tanks in Qatar. Qatar and Turkey maintain strong military ties. Several military cooperation agreements have been signed between the two, and Turkey exports military equipment to Qatar. For instance, Turkey sold Qatar its first-ever drones in March 2012, and in April 2017, Turkish vehicle manufacturer BMC signed a deal to supply Qatar with 1,500 Amazon 4x4 armored vehicles. Turkey has a military base in Qatar, and in June 2017, Turkish parliament fast-tracked the deployment of Turkish troops in Qatar. Turkey plans to eventually station 3,000 troops on Qatari soil. Trade relations between the two countries have witnessed rapid developments in recent years. Qatar has signed agreements with Turkey to export LNG, while several Turkish construction companies have agreements with the Qatari government, many of which are involved in 2022 FIFA World Cup projects. In September 2017, a new trade line route between Qatar and Turkey via Iran was announced, and at the same time a shipping service between Turkey's Port of Mersin and Qatar's Hamad Port was also launched. Relations during the Ottoman period Beginning in the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire started campaigning to incorporate the provinces of Eastern Arabia into their empire. After establishing themselves on al-Hasa coast, they advanced towards Qatar, which had come to serve as a base of operations for Bedouins who opposed Ottoman rule. In 1871, in an attempt to secure a landing for Ottoman troops, they sent an envoy bearing an Ottoman flag to the proclaimed ruler of the Qatari Peninsula, Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani. Although being of Wahhabi background, the Al Thani leader accepted and flew the flag, and by December of that year had authorised the Ottomans to send military equipment and 100 troops to Al Bidda. In January 1872, Qatar was formally incorporated into the Ottoman Empire as a province in Najd with Al Thani being appointed its kaymakam (sub-governor). Most Qataris were allowed to retain their previous positions in the new administration. The arrival of the Ottomans came three years after the end of the Qatari‚ÄìBahraini War. Until today, Turkey's relationship with Wahhabi Qatar is seen to be a special, in contrast to much- tenser relationship with fellow Wahhabi Saudi Arabia. In 1890, the Ottomans attempted to further consolidate their influence over Qatar by imposing numerous administrative reforms, increasing taxes and stationing additional troops in their garrison at Al Bidda. This eventually led Jassim Al Thani to rebel against the Ottomans, who he believed were seeking to usurp control of the peninsula. He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892. This, along with the March 1893 imprisonment of more than a dozen members of Qatari tribal leaders by the governor of Basra, Mehmed Hafiz Pasha, culminated in the Battle of Al Wajbah. After the Qataris defeated the Ottomans in that battle, Sultan Abdul Hamid II granted Jassim Al Thani a full pardon. After the Young Turks assumed power in the Ottoman Empire in 1908, they declared they were renouncing their claims on Qatar on 29 July 1913. The last of the Ottoman troops in Qatar peacefully evacuated in August 1915. This move was seen as an attempt of currying the United Kingdom's favor.  Political relations  =Political cooperation= The history of bilateral relations between Qatar and Turkey date back to the 1970s. In the 1980s, the two nations began signing bilateral agreements with one another. Bilateral relations gained further traction in the 2000s with the signing of several additional agreements. Their coordination in regional politics, particularly in the Syrian Civil War and the Egyptian Crisis has led their relation to be described as an alliance. Both countries have rejected the designation of Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist entities. While commenting on the turmoil in the Middle East during a joint press conference held with Qatar in December 2014, President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan stated that \\"together with Qatar, we always side with oppressed people around the world\\". Both countries have several common regional threat-perception, patronize the same regional non-state actors (including in Syria) and share similar agendas in Syria, Libya, Egypt and elsewhere. Qatar and Turkey's alliance have translated into closer cooperation in international organizations such as the UN and OIC. It was announced that Turkey and Qatar agreed to establish a cooperation council called 'High-level Strategic Cooperation Council' on 19 January 2015. This decision was revealed after a meeting between the countries' foreign ministers Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu and Khalid bin Mohammad Al Attiyah concerning the recent mutual diplomatic shifts away from Egypt since Abdel Fattah el-Sisi rose to power in 2014. The first meeting of the council took place in Doha that December, during a visit by President Erdoƒüan. Following Turkish air strikes conducted in August 2015 over fighters of the PKK group in north Iraq, the Arab League released a statement denouncing Turkey's actions. However, Qatar, a member of the organization, dissociated itself from this position, and instead proclaimed its support for Turkey. Egypt Both countries have been diplomatically involved in the Egyptian Crisis, where they mutually opposed Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's leadership. Following pro-Islamist candidate Mohammed Morsi's election victory in 2012, Turkey and Qatar supported his presidency, whereas the other five GCC nations were against his presidency. Morsi was ousted eventually in a coup d'√©tat in 2013, provoking condemnation by Turkey. Qatar, on the other hand, while not directly criticizing the coup d'√©tat, was the only GCC nation to denounce the excessive use of force against civilians. In a 2016 interview with Al Jazeera, President Erdoƒüan strongly condemned Egypt's leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, saying that he has \\"killed thousands of his own people\\". Qatar and Turkey have both been pressed by the other GCC states to improve their ties with Egypt. Sisi declared on 14 June 2017, just 9 days after the start of the 2017 Qatari diplomatic crisis, that the group of countries boycotting Qatar should also target Turkey. Syria Qatar and Turkey share similar positions on the Syrian Civil War. The two formed a single bloc in the Civil War and supported the same rebel groups. One prominent opposition group funded by both Turkey and Qatar is the pro-Islamist Syrian National Council. Libya Turkey and Qatar both backed the pro-Islamist General National Congress in Libya. In January 2015, a Libyan army official accused Turkey and Qatar of funneling arms to Islamist political factions in Libya via Sudan.  Muslim Brotherhood factor  Both Qatar and Turkey overtly provides region-wide support for Muslim Brotherhood. Muslim Brotherhood's web of network in the region is something Qatar is using to project its influence internationally and compete with other regional players, while Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (otherwise known as AK Party) promotes a mix of democracy and Islam like that of the Brotherhood. In 2014, when Doha asked several Brotherhood exiles to leave Qatar due to the pressure from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States, Turkey decided to host these exiles. 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt When elements of the Turkish military attempted a military coup in July 2016, Qatar became the first country whose leader called President Erdoƒüan in a show of solidarity. Qatar also strongly denounced the coup, saying it breached Turkey's constitutional legitimacy. It was claimed by some media outlets that 150 Qatari elite special forces troops were deployed in Turkey shortly after the attempt to watch over the president. 2017 Qatari diplomatic crisis Turkey supported Qatar in its diplomatic confrontation with a Saudi and Emirati-led bloc of countries that severed ties with and imposed sanctions on Qatar on 5 June 2017. Turkish President Erdoƒüan criticized the list of demands released by the countries on 22 June, stating that they undermine Qatar's sovereignty. Because the boycotting nations highlight Qatar's support for the Muslim Brotherhood as one of the primary reasons for their sanctions, siding with Qatar was the most logical choice for Turkey's leadership, which also supports the Muslim Brotherhood. On August 26, Turkey said that it had intercepted five hackers suspected of engineering the diplomatic crisis by inserting false and provocative statements on Qatar News Agency's website in late-May. The Saudi-led blockade has led to closer cooperation and improved ties between Turkey and Iran, the other major power supporting Qatar's position. Turkish opposition to political cooperation Qatar and Turkey's bilateral relations have proven to be a contentious issue in Turkish politics. Some members of the Turkish political society oppose Turkey's and Qatar's mutual position of arming Syrian rebel groups, and believe that maintaining this stance will harm Turkey's international reputation. Another issue taken up by some in the political community is the perceived damage afflicted to Turkey's image as a neutral regional mediator. Other controversial points include criticism of Qatar's human rights and their non- acceptance of Syrian refugees. =Diplomatic visits= High level visits have given a new momentum to the bilateral relations between the two countries. The visit of Qatari emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani to Turkey on 25‚Äì26 December 2001 paved the way drawing the legal framework of economic and military cooperation through the signing of a number of protocols. These protocols included the Agreement on Prevention of Double Taxation, the Agreement on Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, and the Cooperation Agreement on Military Fields. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan paid several official visits to Qatar. His first visit to Qatar was in 2005; this was followed by visits in 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Turkey's President Abdullah G√ºl, accompanied by the Minister of Finance, Minister of Energy, Minister of Public Work and Settlement, and a large group of businessmen, paid official visits to Qatar in February and April 2008. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan also visited Qatar in April 2008, and gave a key speech at the Doha Forum on Democracy, Development and Free Trade. He also held talks with Qatar's Emir, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister concerning economic agreements. The Foreign Minister and Prime Minister of Qatar paid return visits to Turkey in 2008, during which the 1st Turkish-Qatari Business Forum was held. In 2008, Foreign Minister Ali Babacan visited Qatar to attend ‚ÄúThe US-Islamic World Forum‚Äù as a keynote speaker organized by Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the US based Brookings Institution, as well as to have a bilateral meeting with his colleague Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani. In February 2016 Turkish President Erdoƒüan met with Qatari emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Istanbul to discuss military cooperation in Syria. One year later, in February 2017, President Erdoƒüan traveled to Doha on an official visit. More than a month after the 2017 Qatari diplomatic crisis erupted on 5 June, President Erdoƒüan visited Qatar, along with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in late July in a bid to allay the crisis. Qatari emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani visited Turkey to discuss the diplomatic crisis with President Erdoƒüan in September 2017. Both of them emphasized the importance of resolving the crisis by negotiations. Military relations Qatar and Turkey signed an agreement in July 2002 which involved cooperation in military training and arms sales. A cooperation agreement involving both countries' defense industries was formalized in 2007. In March 2012, Qatar acquired its first-ever drones from Turkey in the form of ten mini-drones worth $2.5 million. This sale was part of a deal formed in May 2011 in which Turkey would sell $120 million worth of military equipment to Qatar in the span of a year. The two states signed a military cooperation agreement in July 2012, but details of the agreement were not disclosed. In March 2015, both countries signed a military agreement which entailed mutual military deployment and the exchange of military training. However, the reasons behind this military agreement have not been officially explained, therefore raising suspicions in Turkey over whether Turkish military personnel stationed in Qatar would help train Syrian opposition groups. An event showcasing products from 67 Turkish defense companies was held in Doha in October 2015. Qatar's government owns a 50% stake in BMC, a Turkish military vehicle manufacturer. It was reported in April 2017 that BMC received an order for 1,500 Amazon 4x4 armored vehicles from Qatar's military and police force. =Turkish military presence in Qatar= On 2 December 2015, during a Turkish presidential visit to Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad and Tayyip Erdoƒüan jointly announced the planned creation of a Turkish military base in Qatar; a first for Turkey in the Persian Gulf. On December 16, 2016 Turkey's Ambassador to Qatar Ahmet Demirok declared that the establishment of the base was part of a broader defence agreement between the two countries to help them confront ‚Äúcommon enemies.‚Äù According to Eyup Ersoy, a Gulf politics expert teaching at Bilkent University, the military base exemplifies Turkey and Qatar's willingness to overcome their strategic isolation in the region. The agreement also stipulates that Qatar may set up a military base in Turkey if it desires. The agreement was first signed in 2014 and ratified by the Turkish Parliament in June 2015. The base was expected to be completed in two years. According to Ambassador Demirok, air and naval units, military trainers, special operations forces as well as 3,000 ground troops will be stationed at the base. Two days after a number of countries led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates severed ties with Qatar on 5 June 2017, Turkey's leading party proposed the fast-tracking of Turkish troop deployment in Qatar, and also proposed joint training programmes between the two countries' militaries. On 18 June, an armed Turkish contingent consisting of five military vehicles and twenty-three military personnel were sent to Qatar. They supplemented the existing 88-strong Turkish force stationed there. Turkish soldiers currently have their base of operations at an abandoned British base located 15 miles away from Doha. A list of demands drafted by the blockading countries and handed to Qatar on 22 June included a demand that Turkey withdraws its troops from the country. Shortly after the list was made public, Turkish President Erdoƒüan rejected the removal of Turkish troops from Qatari soil, claiming that the list of demands violated international law. On 26 June, the foreign minister of Bahrain, one of Qatar's maritime neighbors who severed ties with it, blamed Qatar for \\"military escalations\\" by its hosting of Turkish troops. At the end of the month, Turkey sent more troops to Qatar, to participate in joint military drills. Additional Turkish troops were stationed in Qatar by 11 July, and more arrived on 17 July, bolstering the Turkish military presence in the country to about 150. Currently, there are more than 3,000 Turkish soldiers in Qatar to help the Qatari citizens. The number of Turkish troops in Qatar could rise to 5,000 in the future. Turkey's ambassador to Qatar Fikret √ñzer confirmed in February 2018 that Turkish air and naval troops will eventually be stationed in Qatar after the necessary infrastructure is built, however, no date has been given. At the Doha International Maritime Defence Exhibition and Conference (DIMDEX) held in March 2018, both countries signed an agreement that would allow Turkey to construct a naval base in the north of Qatar which would include a training facility.  Economic relations  Economic relations witnessed substantial development in the 21st century. In the 2000, the total trade volume between the two countries was $38 million. By 2014, this number had increased to $739 million, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute. This figure is lower than the trade volume between Turkey and all of its other trade partners in the region, except for Bahrain. On 11 June 2008, Qatar Investment Authority and Turkey Investment Support and Promotion Agency signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and it opened a comprehensive cooperation between two countries. Qatar mainly imports from Turkey iron-steel products, electrical equipment, motor vehicles, home textile products, food and furniture, while Turkey's investments in the Gulf country are mostly focused in the consultancy and construction sectors. Petroleum and its derivatives, aluminum and plastic products are among the products mostly imported by Turkey from Qatar. From 2011 to 2015, Qatar's import of Turkish products increased by 126%, whereas Turkey's import of Qatari products decreased by 25%. The cooperation between the two countries may soon extend into the field of infrastructure, as the World Cup Supreme Committee of Qatar, which will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, has recently announced a collaboration agreement with the Turkish Football Federation. =Natural gas= The Qatar-Turkey pipeline was proposed by Qatar in 2009 in order to connect the two region's natural gas reserves. In fact, natural gas is one of Qatar's most important export products to Turkey. Turkey reached an agreement with Qatar to purchase liquefied natural gas over a prolonged period in December 2015. It was opined by analysts that, owing to diplomatic hostilities between Turkey and Russia, the deal was made by Turkey with the intent of replacing Russia with Qatar as its major LNG supplier. =Foreign investments= In terms of foreign direct investments, between 2003 and 2015, Turkey ranked as Qatar's 23rd largest investor, with 3 companies making investments worth $239 million. Qatar's outward investments during this same period reflected Turkey as the 17th most popular destination for Qatari foreign investments. More than $2.1 billion was invested in Turkey by two Qatari companies. In 2016, Qatar had the second- highest value of investments made in Turkey that year by an Asian country after Azerbaijan, investing a total of $375 million. According to statements made by Mohammed bin Ahmed bin Towar Al Kuwari, vice-chairman of the Qatar Chamber, in May 2017, there were 205 Turkish companies operating out of Qatar; 186 of these were joint ventures between Turks and Qataris. These companies are mainly based in the contracting, engineering and construction industries. The value of investments made by the joint ventures amount to QR42 million, whereas the fully-Turkish companies have invested more than QR62 million. He stated that Qatar's foreign direct investments in Turkey over $20 billion, which would rank it second for foreign investment in Turkey. In late 2017, it was reported that Qatar agreed to invest another $19 billion in 2018, with the Qatar Investment Authority pledging $15 billion of investments and Q Invest accounting for the remaining $4 billion. In September 2018, the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani gave a Boeing 747-8 worth some $400 million to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. Following that, Sheikh Tamim made an investment of $15 billion in the Turkish economy. =Economic relations during the 2017 Qatari diplomatic crisis= Turkey supported Qatar economically during the 2017 Qatari diplomatic crisis, when, on 5 June, several of Qatar's neighbors sealed off their air, land and sea borders to Qatar-flagged vessels and vessels arriving to and from Qatar. From 5 June to 25 June, Turkey's exports to Qatar tripled in value. Turkey mainly helped Qatar with food supplies, particularly dairy, poultry and fruit products. At one point, Turkey was exporting 200,000 tonnes of vegetables to Qatar daily, and was also helping Qatar meet the majority of its dairy supply. In an effort to increase bilateral trade volume, fifteen separate trade and cooperation agreements were signed between the Turkish and Qatari governments in August 2017. It was also announced in August 2017 that a Qatar-Turkey Business Council would be established in October of that year. On 6 September, a trade line route between Qatar and Turkey running through Iran was inaugurated, shortening the travel time of goods traded to under 2 days. Prior to the launch of this new trade route, transportation by land took 14 days, while transportation by sea took an additional 11 days. The final stop of the new route is from the Iranian Bushehr Port to Ar Ru'ays Port in Qatar, which can be traveled in under ten hours. In addition to this new trade route, a shipping service between Turkey's Port of Mersin and Qatar's Hamad Port was also announced. A report released the same month indicated that Turkey's exports to Qatar had increased by 84% since the onset of the Qatari diplomatic crisis on 5 June. Livestock and aquatic products accounted for the largest portion of exports. Turkey's government has capitalized on the crisis by directing Turkish suppliers to raise their prices. Furthermore, Ankara has pressed Qatar into granting preferential selection for Turkish companies as well as formalizing more long-term agreements. =2018 Turkish currency and debt crisis= During the 2018 Turkish currency and debt crisis, in mid-August Qatar pledged $15 billion worth of direct investments into Turkey. A few days after announcing this, Qatar's Central Bank signed an agreement with the Turkish Central Bank for a $3 billion currency swap. Officials involved with the deal have stated it will drastically improve bilateral trade. Some analysts have cited Qatar's financial assistance to Turkey as a good example of the consistent advancement of bilateral relations in recent years. Another view is that Qatar is attempting to repay Turkey for its loyalty and military assistance during the Qatar diplomatic crisis.  Cultural relations  On 4 December 2013, Erdoƒüan inaugurated the new headquarters of the country's embassy in Doha and announced the establishment of a Turkish cultural center in Qatar. The construction of a 'Turkish village' in Doha was launched in September 2014 in the midst of a visit by President Erdoƒüan. The village is set to occupy approximately 400,000 sq meters and will feature traditional Ottoman markets, hotels and other service facilities. The Qatar‚ÄìTurkey 2015 Year of Culture was implemented by the Qatari government in January as an initiative to improve cultural cooperation between the two countries. As a result of this cultural initiative, in December 2015 the Yunus Emre Institute opened a center in Doha. Aside from coordinating cultural activities with the Turkish embassy in Doha, the center will also host language classes, exhibitions and conferences. Educational and medical relations The first Turkish school to operate in Qatar, T√ºrk Okulu, was inaugurated in October 2016. It was reported that the school would have a student capacity of 300 with a faculty count of 17 teachers. In February 2017, during a visit by President Erdoƒüan, the second school in Doha to follow a Turkish curriculum opened its doors. Constructed at a cost of roughly $5.5 million and able to accommodate 250 students, the school is directed by the Turkish embassy in Doha. After an agreement was reached between the two countries for Turkey to establish a hospital to serve the needs of Qatar's population, the Turkish Hospital in Qatar opened its doors in January 2017 with a 100-bed capacity.

The company was formed in 1856, the line was opened in 1859, and it was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway in 1866. History The construction of the Alford Valley Railway began in 1856 and the line opened in 1859. It ran in a westerly direction from , a station on the line from Aberdeen to Inverness. The line served Kemnay Quarry and three other granite quarries in the area. The summit of the line is just west of Tillyfourie at where a mile-long cutting deep required cutting through particularly hard granite. The train took just over an hour for the 16 mile journey and until 1883 by law the third class fare on one train a day could not be more than a penny per mile. On 30 July 1866, the GNoSR obtained an Act of Parliament authorising it to amalgamate with several associated railways, including the Alford Valley Railway, Keith and Dufftown Railway, and the Strathspey Railway; this took place on 1 August 1866. Two unadvertised halts were later opened for workmen at Paradise Siding and Ratchill (or Ratch-Hill) Siding between Kenmay and Kintore but both were closed in the late 1930s.Private and Untimetabled Railway Stations by G.Croughton and others In 1923 GNoSR was incorporated into the London and North Eastern Railway and in 1948 became part of the Scottish Region of British Railways. The line closed to passengers on 31 December 1949 and to goods on 31 December 1965. Current operations Apart from a short section at Alford which has been reopened as the narrow gauge Alford Valley Railway, the remainder of the line has been dismantled.

The station was established in 1948 by David M. Segal and owned by him for nearly six decades. WGVM is currently owned and operated by Monte Spearman and Gentry Todd Spearman, through licensee High Plains Radio Network, LLC. The station began with an eclectic array of live programming including blues and Gospel music, transitioned to rockabilly-influenced Top 40 in the 1950s, and became a top-rated country music station in the 1960s and 1970s. WGVM's fortunes followed the general decline of AM radio stations in the United States and the station went off the air for several months in 2006 before finding a new owner and a new direction. WGVM now serves the \\"Ark-La-Miss\\" region with a classic hits format. Programming WGVM broadcasts a classic hits format to the \\"Ark-La-Miss\\" region bounded by Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to the northwest, Batesville, Arkansas, to the northeast, Monroe, Louisiana, to the southwest, and Jackson, Mississippi, to the southeast. WGVM is a Class D \\"AM daytimer\\", restricted to broadcasting only during daylight hours to protect the nighttime coverage areas of more powerful regional Class B stations and other local Class D stations. The station switched to sports programming when WGVM returned to the air after it was sold in 2006. WGVM was an affiliate of the Fox Sports Radio network and receives select programs from the ESPN Radio and Premiere Radio networks until July 2013. In addition to sports talk programming, the station airs live sports as part of the Southern Miss Golden Eagles' baseball and football radio networks and as part of the Ole Miss Rebels baseball and men's basketball radio networks. The station also broadcasts coach's shows from both schools. History =Early days= WGVM 'Top 40' survey for April 27, 1959 The station launched in December 1948 with 1,000 watts of power on 1260 kilohertz as the second radio station licensed to serve Greenville, Mississippi. The station was assigned the call sign \\"WGVM\\" by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). This was Greenville's second radio station as WJPR (now WNIX, 1330 AM) signed on in 1937. WGVM was founded by owner David M. Segal who also served as general manager. Other key personnel at launch included Merle Stein as station manager and Welton H. Jetton as chief engineer. =1950s= By 1950, the broadcast license was transferred to a new company, the Cotton Belt Broadcasting Company, owned by Segal who was also the company's president. By 1953, the name of the company was changed to Cotton Belt Broadcasting Corporation of Mississippi to reflect the fact that WGVM was now part of the Cotton Belt Group, seven radio stations across Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, and Mississippi that were all owned or controlled by David M. Segal. Just two years later, the company name was changed to Mid-America Broadcasting Company, reflecting the shift in location of the other stations in the group. Segal now controlled just four stations with two in Missouri and one each in Colorado and Mississippi. People Turnover in key positions was steady through the 1950s with Howard E. Gurney assuming the general manager role and Louis A. Kurtz as program director by 1950. By 1951, David M. Segal resumed his general manager role and Wallace Hoy became WGVM's program director. In late 1953, Wayne McChristian became the station's chief engineer. In 1956, Joseph C. Gunter was named chief engineer for the station and Jack R. Stull took on both the general manager and commercial manager roles. However, just two years later Edward M. Guss was brought in as general manager and Stull moved to the commercial manager slot full-time. Music Little Milton performing in 2002 WGVM initially featured a variety of musical styles, including live blues music programs plus Gospel music on Sundays. Early show hosts included future blues legends Willie Love and Little Milton. Regular Sunday performers included the Famous St. John Gospel Singers whose young guitarist, Riley King, would later find fame in Memphis as the \\"Blues Boy of Beale Street\\" and become known as B.B. King. In the late 1950s, WGVM aired a rockabilly-influenced Top 40 radio format featuring artists such as Elvis Presley, Ricky Nelson, and Frankie Avalon. Along with the Top 40 songs, WGVM continued to program blocks of Gospel, blues, and rhythm and blues music (lumped together in broadcast industry publications of the day as \\"Negro music\\") with roughly 30 hours per week in 1958 but just over 22 hours per week in 1959. =1960s= In 1961, after a decade under Wally Hoy, WGVM brought in James B. Ashley as program director and split off the news director role to David Smith. James Jared Tugwell became the station's new chief engineer. Also in 1961, the station was granted a construction permit by the FCC to increase its signal strength from 1,000 watts to 5,000 watts, still restricted to daylight-only operation. The station began broadcasting with the stronger signal by 1963. Joel Netherland was hired as program director and news director in 1966. By 1968, those duties would be split again as Cal Adams became program director and Bill Brown was hired as news director. Also in 1968, Robert Meador became WGVM's chief engineer. Adams and Brown's tenure would prove short-lived as Art Baca became program director in 1969 with Andy Roberts taking the news director position. In the 1960s the station flipped to country music which proved a boon to the station's ratings. The format switch meant a decrease in \\"Negro music\\" programming from 24.5 hours per week in 1963 to just 16 hours per week, mostly on weekends, by 1965. This programming would continue to disappear from WGVM with just three hours per week by 1967 and the station reporting itself as \\"100%\\" country & western in 1968. In December 1967, sister station WGVM-FM (100.7 FM) signed on the air as a simulcast of WGVM during daylight hours and continuing a similar country music format at night and overnight. By 1970, the FM station was renamed WDMS after owner David M. Segal and derived only 25% of its programming from WGVM. =Musical changes= In September 1973, program director Chuck Alan moved on to KRMD (1340 AM) in Shreveport, Louisiana, and Burt Brown moved up into the position for WGVM. Brown told Billboard that he would \\"soften\\" the top-ranked station's country format in an effort to appeal to a younger demographic. In the late 1990s, the station shifted again, this time to an older-skewing classic country format. In addition to its regular music programming, in 1999 WGVM broadcast college football games as a member of both the Delta State Statesmen and Southern Miss Golden Eagles sports radio networks. Sports broadcasts continued into the early 2000s as the station broadcast University of Southern Mississippi men's basketball and football plus National Football League games as a member of the Tennessee Titans, and later New Orleans Saints, radio networks. =Falling silent= On May 11, 2006, WGVM ceased broadcasting temporarily while a search for a new owner for the station was conducted. Station ownership told the FCC that station founder and primary owner David M. Segal was elderly and suffering \\"some health issues\\" which made it difficult to oversee station operations from his California residence. In addition, the station was having \\"a difficult time\\" retaining managers and sales people plus the money saved by taking WGVM off the air temporarily would be used to speed the process of finding a buyer for the ailing station. In July 2006, a buyer was found with John R. Salyer and Wesley K. Gerald teaming up with WGVM's then-current general manager Robert J. \\"Bob\\" Ghetti to form a new corporation, WDMS Inc. The new company agreed to purchase both WGVM and FM sister station WDMS from Segal's Mid-America Broadcasting Company for a combined sales price of $780,000. The FCC approved the transaction on September 15, 2006, and the deal was formally consummated on November 9, 2006. This ended nearly six decades of continuous WGVM ownership by station founder David M. Segal. =New beginning= WGVM returned to the air in late 2006 under new ownership and with a new format: sports and sports talk as an affiliate of ESPN Radio. While the primary network affiliation later switched to Fox Sports Radio, WGVM has maintained this sports radio format since the 2006 return to the air. In 2008, John Rickey Salyer, the majority owner of license-holder WDMS Inc., filed for bankruptcy protection. At the time of the filing, Salyer owned 57% of the company, Robert J. Ghetti owned 18%, and Wesley K. Gerald owned 25%. Control of WGVM was involuntarily transferred from Salyer to Jeffrey A. Livingston as an interim trustee in May 2008. In June 2008, Livingston reached an agreement to transfer Salyer's share of the corporation to Robert J. Ghetti as a partial resolution of Salyer's debts. The voluntary transfer of control was approved by the FCC on July 22, 2008, and the deal was formally consummated on September 11, 2008. Righetti now owned 75% of WDMS Inc. with Wesley K. Gerald retaining his 25% stake. WGVM and sister station WDMS were sold by WDMS Inc. to ARK-LA-MS Radio Group, LLC effective July 5, 2012 in exchange for payments and assumption of bank debt worth $734,231. Both stations were sold again effective November 21, 2016 to High Plains Radio Network, LLC for $500,000. Station alumni Along with his work with Sonny Boy Williamson on King Biscuit Time in the late 1940s, Delta blues pianist Willie Love became the host of his own radio show on WGVM. Love, after years of heavy drinking, died in August 1953 at the age of 46. Before receiving his first recording contract with Sun Records in 1953 and going on to become \\"one of the world‚Äôs leading performers of blues and soul music\\" as a singer and guitarist, \\"Little Milton\\" Campbell hosted a program on WGVM. Little Milton would go on to be inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1988. In November 1959, WGVM program director Wallace \\"Wally\\" Hoy was elected to the board of directors of the Disk Jockey Association. The DJA was founded in Chicago in 1957. Joe Ray, then general manager of WGVM and sister station WDMS, served as president of the Mississippi Association of Broadcasters for the 1981 calendar year.

She has served as Commissioner since 2009 for the 10th district, which includes many of Chicago‚Äôs north side neighborhoods. She is a member of the Democratic Party. Bio Gainer was born and raised in the Beverly neighborhood on Chicago's south side. In 1990, she graduated from University of Illinois with a bachelor of arts in English and political science. Afterwards, she moved to New York City to work as a community organizer with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps. She moved back to Chicago in 1994 to continue her work as community organizer to work with local community members to keep schools open later in the day for after-school programming. From there, Gainer worked as a budget analyst in Chicago's City Hall. She then went on to work for the Park District as the Director of the Lakefront Parks. Gainer later went on to join Aon in a financial role and continues to work for Aon today. Gainer has an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago. Gainer is married to Dennis Kibby and has three children.[1] Political career Gainer was initially appointed to the seat in April 2009 to replace former commissioner Mike Quigley, who won the special election to fill former Congressman Rahm Emanuel's seat when Emanuel left Congress to become White House Chief of Staff to President Obama. In 2010, Gainer defeated her Republican opponent in the November 2010 election and won a four-year term. In March of 2018, Gainer won her primary election against her opponent. As commissioner she ensured the CCLBA works independently from the Cook County Board earning revenue from the property sales and reinvesting into the budget to provide an infrastructure to provide additional resources for first-time home buyers and small neighborhood developers. Since the program began, 400 homes have been purchased and rehabbed.[3] * Worked to reform the county lobbying ordinance in a stated effort to be more transparent.[4] * Voted against video gaming in bars [6] In 2015, U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Gainer founded a Chicago chapter of Off the Sidelines, a civic impact organization for women which gained over 3,000 members.[7] In 2017, Off the Sidelines Chicago was renamed Cause the Effect Chicago.[9]  Controversies  Despite mulling a bid for Chicago mayor since Richard M. Daley's retirement in 2011, Gainer ultimately took her name out of the race for mayor in the 2019 election. She had also come under scrutiny for her driving record and attendance at legislative sessions. Over her tenure on the County Board Gainer missed 32% of County Board meetings and 38% of Forest Preserve meetings. In November 2018, Chicago public radio station WBEZ sued Cook County in relation to e-mails the government would not release as part of a FOIA.

Emery married the actor Cyril Maude on 28 April 1888 at Kensington Register Office, and they had another marriage ceremony at the Savoy Chapel on 2 June 1888. She next appeared at the Vaudeville Theatre and, for Augustus Harris, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Returning to the Vaudeville Theatre in February 1890, she played the title role in Clarissa, adapted by Robert Williams Buchanan from the novel by Samuel Richardson.Clarissa, The Times, 7 February 1890 In the same year, and at the same theatre, she played leading roles in The School for Scandal and She Stoops to Conquer, among others. She starred in Judah by Henry Arthur Jones at the Shaftesbury Theatre in September 1890 before appearing at the Olympic Theatre with Wilson Barrett in December 1890. May 1891 saw Emery back at the Shaftesbury Theatre, and in February 1892 she took the title role in the original production of Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan at the St James's Theatre. Between 1893 and 1895 Emery played the lead female roles for J. Comyns Carr at the Comedy Theatre, where she appeared in Grundy's The New Woman and Sowing the Wind and Pinero's The Benefit of the Doubt. Such was her fame by this time that her portrait was drawn by Aubrey Beardsley, appearing in the January 1895 edition of The Yellow Book.Winifred Emery, Collector's Post website, accessed 7 June 2011 In February 1896 she appeared at the Lyceum Theatre under the management of Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson. Later years Emery with her children, c. 1901 In 1896 her husband became manager and leading man at the Haymarket Theatre, and Emery went with him, becoming his leading lady. However, owing to a period of illness and the birth of her son, her appearances there between 1898 and 1905 were sporadic, and included She Stoops to Conquer, in 1900, and The Second in Command, by Robert Marshall, in 1901. She made her theatrical 'comeback' in February 1905, when she played Beatrice in Much Ado about Nothing opposite Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty's Theatre. In January 1906 she appeared at the Waldorf Theatre as Mrs Pellender in The Superior Miss Pellender. Emery formed her own theatrical company and with it she and her husband toured provincial theatres, the two of them starring in Olivia and Her Son by Horace Annesley Vachell. This play transferred to the Playhouse Theatre, then under Cyril Maude's management, in March 1907. From 1907 to 1922 Emery played leading roles in numerous productions at West End theatres, including the Playhouse Theatre with her husband; His Majesty's Theatre in The Merry Wives of Windsor; Drury Lane in The Bunking of Betty; the St James's Theatre in T. W. Robertson's Caste; the Lyric Theatre in Sir Walter Ralegh; the Vaudeville Theatre in Pinero's The Schoolmistress; the Apollo Theatre in Never Say Die by W. H. Post, starring Charles Hawtrey (1913); the Gaiety Theatre in Maeterlinck's The Betrothal, and at the Duke of York's Theatre in Pinero's The Enchanted Cottage (1922). At the Royal Command Performance in May 1911 at Drury Lane before Wilhelm II, Emery appeared in an excerpt from Bulwer-Lytton's Money; and at the Coronation Gala Performance for George V, held at His Majesty's Theatre on 27 June 1911, she played Elizabeth I in Sheridan's The Critic, directed by Sir Squire Bancroft. Her last performance was at His Majesty's Theatre on 26 February 1923 in a charity production of The Ballad Monger. Emery died of stomach cancer at her home in Bexhill-on-Sea in Sussex, aged 62, and was buried at St Mark's Church in Bexhill. Family life Her children with Maude included Margery Maude, who became an actress; Pamela Cynthia Maude (1893‚Äì1975); and John Cyril Maude, who became a barrister, judge and Member of Parliament.The family of Winifred Emery on thepeerage.com, accessed 8 June 2011 Pamela Maude married Major William La Touche Congreve VC, DSO, MC on 1 June 1916.

Personal computers now have the capacity to process information easier and quicker than ever before, and so today's computer could be considered an important or even essential tool in translation. However, problems arise in the use of computers in translation, as the computer is no substitute for traditional tools such as monolingual and bilingual dictionaries, terminologies and encyclopaedias on paper or in digital format and although we can easily access a large amount of information, we need to find the right and reliable information. Here Corpora and concordancing software play an important role since gaining access to information about language, content and translation practices which was hardly available to translators before the present stage of ICT development.  Machine Translation based on Corpus  Machine translation from corpus linguistics is based in the analysis of real samples with its own translations. Among the different devices that use corpus, there are statistical methods and based on examples. = Statistical Methods = The main objective of statistic machine translation is to generate translations from statistical methods based in corpus of bilingual texts. For instance European parliament minutes are written in all EU (European Union) official languages. If there were more of this corpus, we would get excellent results of translation of texts about those subjects. The first statistic machine translation program was CANDIDE by IBM. = Based on examples = Machine translation based on examples is well known for using a bilingual corpus as the main source of knowledge. Basically it‚Äôs an analogical translation and could be interpreted as a practice of cases reasoning used in automatic learning, which consists in solving a problem basing on solutions of others similar problems.  Corpora and Translation  = Translation typology = According to EAGLES, we can make a general distinction between Monolingual and Multilingual corpora. At the same time in multilingual corpora, we can distinguish between Comparable corpora and Corpora compiled using similar design criteria but which are not translations. Parallel or Translation corpora are texts in one language aligned with their translation in another. We have to take into account several variables like directness of translation, number of languages, etc. There are many Monolingual Comparable Corpora (corpus composed in two sub-sections, one of original texts in one language and the other texts translated into the same language). It‚Äôs useful for translation theorists and researchers but professional technical translators use translation memories. = Defining Translation memories= Translation memory is a very specific type of parallel corpus in that: # It is ‚Äúpropietory‚Äù: TMs are created individually or collectively around specific translation projects. # TMs tend to be closure. They are standardized and have a restricted range of linguistic options. Translation workbenches and TMs could be considered the most successful translation tool; however it‚Äôs restricted to specific text types.  Corpora aids in Translation  The previous kinds of corpora can be combined with other tools like a dictionary for example. Corpora can function as general or specialized dictionaries. In that way, Comparable corpora can be seen as a monolingual dictionary and Parallel corpora could be compared to a bilingual dictionary.  Corpus resources for Translators  Not all dictionaries are the same, and neither are all corpora. Apart from translation memories, corpus resources with a potential use for professional translators could be classified from ‚Äúrobust‚Äù to ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù. Some examples of corpora could be BNC (British National Corpus) or the Spanish corpus CREA or the Italian CORIS and so on. It‚Äôs important to mention the difference by corpus linguistics between corpora and archives of electronic texts; the second one is only a repertory of electronic texts. Building a corpus of web pages implies an information retrieval operation, in order to locate relevant and reliable documents. In many translation classes students have made their own corpora with DIY (do it yourself) corpora. The main benefits of DIY corpora may be summarized as follows: * They are easy to make. * They are a great resource for content information. * They are a great resource for terminology and phraseology. * Not all topics, not all types and not all languages are available. * The relevance and reliability of documents needs to be carefully assessed. * Existing concordance software isn‚Äôt well equipped for HTML or XML files. Finally the advantages of ‚Äúrobust‚Äù corpora that we can see over ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù corpora are the following: * They are usually more reliable * They are usually larger. * They may be improved with linguistic and contextual information.

He was one of the sons of Evrenos, an Ottoman general. During the 1430s he was sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Albania who, after initial defeats, suppressed the Albanian Revolt of 1432‚Äì1436 with help of the forces commanded by Turahan Bey. In 1440 he participated in the unsuccessful Ottoman Siege of Belgrade. Origin Ali Bey was a son of Ottoman commander Evrenos Bey. Evrenos was a Byzantine convert. The family, known in Turkish as Evrenosoƒüullarƒ±, hailed from Anatolia and was one of four leading warrior (ghazi) families that were instrumental in the late-14th-century Ottoman conquests.  Albania  Ali Bey was sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Albania before 1432. When Ishak Bey captured Dagnum from Koja Zaharia in 1430 it was attached to the territory controlled by Ali Bey. In the early phase of the Albanian Revolt, in the winter of 1432, Sultan Murat II gathered around 10.000 troops under Ali Bey, who marched along the Via Egnatia and reached the central valley of Shkumbin, where he was ambushed and defeated by forces under Gjergj Arianiti. In 1435-6 he followed Turahan Bey's campaign, which restored Ottoman rule in the region.  Other campaigns  According to some legends Hunyadi was Evrenosoglu's groom. Hunyadi became intimate of the king of Hungary after he fled from Ali. Evrenosoglu commanded an army which was sent to plunder Wallachia and Transylvania in 1438. In 1440 Ali Beg participated in the unsuccessful siege of Belgrade where he built a wall around the city and used it to hurl stones. According to Konstantin Mihailoviƒá, the title of bey and corresponding estate was promised to the Ottoman soldier who would wave Ottoman flag on the Belgrade walls. Although Evrenosoglu already had the title of bey at that time he decided to personally lead the assault to the walls of the Belgrade castle hoping to increase his already great reputation. When Murad II died in 1451, Ali Bey was dispatched by Mehmed II to drown Murad's son, K√º√ß√ºk (Little) Ahmed √áelebi.

As Michael Cox, he had a top-ten hit on the UK singles chart in 1960 with \\"Angela Jones\\", produced by Joe Meek. He later worked as an actor, and in TV in New Zealand, using both his full name and the name Michael James. Life and career He was born in Liverpool. After his four younger sisters wrote to ABC TV demanding that he be given a chance to audition for the pop show Oh Boy!, he was quickly signed up by producer Jack Good, and made his first appearance on the show in April 1959 singing Ricky Nelson's \\"Never Be Anyone Else But You\\".Michael Cox: A Brief History Oh Boy!: Whatever became of the stars? Good won him a recording deal with Decca Records, and his first single, \\"Teenage Love\\", was written by Marty Wilde and featured Joe Brown on guitar. However, neither it nor its follow-up \\"Too Hot To Handle\\" were hits. Cox continued to appear on TV, in Good's new show Boy Meets Girls, and Good recommended him to record producer Joe Meek, who at the time was setting up his own label, Triumph. His first record for Triumph was \\"Angela Jones\\", a song written by John D. Loudermilk which was a hit in the US for Johnny Ferguson. Cox's version of the song, produced by Meek, rose to #7 on the UK singles chart in June 1960. The Triumph label collapsed, and Cox's follow-up, the similar-sounding \\"Along Came Caroline\\", also produced by Meek and co- written by Cox under the pseudonym Michael Steele, was released by the HMV label; it reached #41 on the chart and was Cox's only other hit. Michael Cox at Discogs.com Top Twenty Club: Michael Cox Cox was more successful in Scandinavia. His Stand up topped the Swedish best-selling charts for four weeks in January/February 1963. Cox successfully toured in Denmark and Sweden with a backing band, as well as in the UK, and continued to record under Meek's direction for several years. He released singles on the HMV, Pye and Parlophone labels, many of which featured leading session musicians such as guitarist Big Jim Sullivan. However, his later recordings were not hits and he gave up his recording career to attend drama school in the mid-1960s. In 1966, credited as Michael James Cox, he appeared in the movie Where the Bullets Fly, and he also acted in TV plays and commercials. In 1976, he appeared in the filmed version of the musical written by Roger Glover, The Butterfly Ball. In the late 1970s, he began working on cruise ships, where he met his New Zealand-born wife. He started making appearances in the US, eventually emigrating there, before moving on to live in New Zealand. There, he continued to work on TV, credited as Michael James. Compilations of Cox's recordings were issued on CD by Zircon Records in 1999, and Sequel Records in 2003.

He asserted that organs should not be harvested from small children who have been declared brain dead but his proposal was ultimately rejected by the Diet. Diet of Japan Report, February 2004. He moved to the School of Human Sciences, Waseda University, in 2015.  Key concepts  = Brain death as a human relationship = Morioka defines brain death not as a material process occurring inside the brain but as a human relationship formed between a comatose patient and his/her family members or others who surround him/her. He calls this a \\"human relationship oriented analysis\\" approach to bioethics. He claims that brain death is not necessarily human death.Margaret Lock Dead: Organ Transplants and the Reinvention of Death 2001, University of California Press. Reconsidering Brain Death: A Lesson from Japan's Fifteen Years of Experience. = Consciousness communication = In his 1993 book Consciousness Communication he distinguished \\"consciousness communication\\", communication for the purpose of social interaction itself, from \\"information communication\\", communication used as a tool for conveying information. He predicted that consciousness communication would play a central role in the coming information society, and put forward the concepts of \\"community of anonymity\\" and \\"dream navigator\\".Consciousness Communication. = Life studies = Morioka calls his comprehensive approach to the issues of life, death, and nature \\"life studies\\". The ultimate goal of life studies is to help people to live their lives without regret. Morioka asserts that the most important aspect of life studies is never to detach ourselves from the problems we are tackling and never to think of ourselves as exceptions; He encourages us to keep our eyes on our own desires and the evil that he believes is deeply engraved in our hearts.Epilogue of Confessions of a Frigid Man. = Fundamental sense of security = The fundamental sense of security is one of the central concepts in Morioka‚Äôs philosophy. In the book Life Studies Approaches to Bioethics he describes this as \\"a sense of security that allows me to strongly believe that even if I had been unintelligent, ugly, or disabled, my existence in the world itself would have been equally welcomed, and whether I succeed or fail, and even if I become a doddering old man, my existence will continue to be welcomed\\". He asserts that this is a precondition of our being able to live our lives without regret.Yasunobu Nozaki, \\"Review of Masahiro Morioka.

He asserts that this civilization's limitless penchant for eliminating pain and suffering makes us completely lose sight of the meaning of life that is indispensable to human beings and deprives us of the joy of life in exchange for pleasure, pleasantness, and comfort. He further claims that people in advanced countries know that they are drowning in the tide of their painless civilization but do not know how to escape from it.Painless Civilization and Fundamental Sense of Security: A Philosophical Challenge in the Age of Human Biotechnology.

The former is the desire to expand the amount of one's pleasure, property, and stability, and the latter is the desire to dismantle the former, throw away pleasure, property, and stability, and change into a being in a different state of mind and body.Chapter 2 of ÁÑ°ÁóõÊñáÊòéË´ñ, 2003 = Frigid man = Morioka uses the phrase \\"frigid man\\" to describe a man who suffers from sexual frigidity caused by \\"male frigidity\\" and has a (sub-conscious) attraction toward young girls, especially girls wearing school uniforms. Many Japanese adult males suffer from this condition and love to see the images of young girls in the mass media and on the Internet. This is the pathology hidden behind the Japanese male's \\"Lolita complex\\".Confessions of a Frigid Man: A Philosopher's Journey into the Hidden Layers of Men's Sexuality PDF. Japan Times, MAY 5, 2017. = Herbivore men = In Morioka's writings, \\"herbivore men\\" are timid young Japanese men who are inexperienced and unassertive in love and sex. Just after the publication of Morioka's book, Lessons in Love for Herbivore Boys, 2008, the term \\"herbivore men\\" became a buzz word in Japan and was reported worldwide.\\"Blurring the boundaries\\" Japan Times, MAY 10, 2009.

Ioana Fotache, \\"Matters of the Flesh: Japanese Herbivore Men and the Asexuality Umbrella\\" 2016. = Philosophy of life = The philosophy of life is a new discipline in contemporary philosophy that aims to examine the topics of life, death, and nature from various philosophical angles. It widens the scope of the 19th century's Lebensphilosophie and encompasses contemporary bioethics, environmental philosophy, philosophy of biology, biopolitics, the study of the meaning of human life, and other areas of research.\\"Philosophy of Life in Contemporary Society\\" PDF = Birth affirmation = This is one of the key concepts in Morioka's philosophy of life. Birth affirmation means to be able to say yes, from the bottom of our hearts, to the fact that we have been born. Morioka distinguishes \\"birth affirmation\\" from similar concepts such as \\"survival affirmation\\" and \\"affirmation of one's whole life\\". He considers \\"birth denial\\" as the worst form of human evil.Tanj≈ç K≈çtei to wa Nani ka HTML = Dignity of human life = He criticized and enlarged Kant's idea of dignity and proposed three kinds of dignity in human life, namely, \\"dignity of one's life,\\" dignity of a one-off life of a human being, \\"dignity of the body,\\" dignity of having the body, and \\"dignity of connected life,\\" dignity of being connected to other human beings and non-human creatures.Ningen no Inochi no Songen ni tsuite no Yobiteki Kousatsu  Publications  = Book (English) = * 2017 Confessions of a Frigid Man: A Philosopher's Journey into the Hidden Layers of Men's Sexuality PDF Open Access Book = Book (English, Edited by Morioka) = * 2015 Masahiro Morioka (ed.)

The gallery, whose headquarters are in Amsterdam, e.http://www.nomansart.com/No_Mans_Art/About_Us.html experiments with creating an alternative art market structure in which artists can easily participate in different local art markets. Seeing the need for a more inclusive art market in a globalized world, through its pop-up method the gallery has been able to recruit upcoming talents in the city in which they are temporarily exhibiting at, then invite them along to future locations as well as to exhibitions hosted in No Man's Art home gallery in the Netherlands. During their stay in each pop-up location, No Man's Art sets up a network of artists, art lovers, buyers, press and supporters that the artists then can use independently in the future.  Background  No Man's Art Gallery was founded in 2010. Since then, the organization set up or planned pop-up art exhibitions in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Mumbai, Paris, Copenhagen, Shanghai, and Cape Town. In May 2016, No Man's Art became the first Dutch art gallery to establish itself in Iran since the economic sanctions were lifted.  Pop Up Gallery  Every couple of months the gallery organizes a pop-up gallery in a different metropole, exhibiting young artists from the host country as well as the artists that were found at previous destinations. The gallery takes pride in finding special locations for their galleries. Previous locations were: * Rotterdam: A luxury flat for sale in Rotterdam-Kralingen. * Amsterdam: Westerpark in Amsterdam. The art was exhibited on trees, for one night only during the Dutch annual Midwinter barbecue. * Hamburg: Hasenmanufaktur at Hafentor 7, an old 1930s harbor building at Landungsbr√ºcken, Hamburg. * Mumbai: New Great Eastern Mills in Byculla. On the premises of an old mill compound, the visitors had to cross the magnificent ruins of the cotton mill to get to the gallery space facing a pond with turtles. * Paris: 7 Rue Froissart. In the heart of Le Marais, the gallery got a hold of a wonderful 300m2 space. * Copenhagen: No Man's Art did three exhibitions in Copenhagen. One in the Ignatius building in the K√∏dbyen area, one in a chapel on the Vestre Kirkegaard cemetery and one on the control tower on Knippelsbro. * Tehran: There were two different pop-up venues in the city, one being in an uptown gallery space and the other being in an abandoned house. Slum Photography Contest The No Man's Art Slum Photography Contest is an annual photography contest organized by No Man's Art Gallery in an underprivileged neighborhood in the world. The first Slum Photography Contest was held in 2011 in Mumbai, India. 45 children from Dharavi, one of the biggest slums in the world, were given an analogue camera and two film rolls. The gallery teamed up with Acorn India Dharavi Project for a teenagers‚Äô photography contest, and the winning picture was exhibited at the gallery from July 1‚Äì4 2011.Things to do this weekend(02 Jul 2011) No Man's Art Gallery worked together with the NGO Acorn Foundation India and Artefacting Mumbai. Together they gave the children a workshop on how to use the camera, as many of the children had never used one before, then the kids were sent off to document the things in life they enjoyed the most. All children received print outs of their film rolls, and the best ten children were exhibited among other young international artists at the No Man's Art Pop Up Gallery in Mumbai. The pictures are now for sale and regularly exhibited at No Man's Art Gallery. The proceeds go to buying new film rolls for the children.No Man‚Äôs Art Slum Photography Contest References External links *Official website *support-the-slum-photography-contest-blikkiesdorp Category:Internet properties established in 2010 Category:Virtual art museums and galleries Category:Contemporary art galleries ","title":"No Man's Art Gallery"},{"id":"32007416","text":"Johann Jakob Wirz (1778 in Basel - 1858) was a Swiss silkweaver who became known a Theosophist prophet and started a group called the Nazarenes, or in German Nazarener.

In English speaking countries it is pronounced with the first syllable stressed [Ààj…ëÀêtsko ä] and has other less common variants of spelling: 'Iatsko', 'Jaczko'. The surname is rather rare and hasn't been listed among the most common surnames in the above-mentioned countries. Etymology Vladimir Dal, a famous Russian lexicographer in the 19th century, considers '–Ø—Ü–∫–æ' as a word specific to the dialect of Yaroslav region that originates from the word '—è—Ç—Å–∫–æ–π' ['j…ëÀêtskoi] and gives the following interpretation of the meaning of '—è—Ç—Å–∫–æ–π': \\"a pie eaten with honey; biscuit with butter and eggs cooked in a pot or jar\\". A. Superanskaya, a famous contemporary onomastician, thinks that '–Ø—Ü–∫–æ' is a derivative from the first name Yan ['j…ëÀên] widespread in Poland and Belarus, whose diminutives are 'Yatsek', 'Yatsko'.–°—É–ø–µ—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –ê. –ü—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏–º–µ–Ω –∏ —Ñ–∞–º–∏–ª–∏–π // –ù–∞—É–∫–∞ –∏ –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å. 2000. ‚Ññ 6 The Polish-Belarusian 'Yan' is an equivalent of English 'John' and 'Yatsko' can be considered an equivalent of 'Jonnie'. The latter interpretation seems much more plausible since many Yatskos living in Russia came from Belarus. However, in fact the Polish given name Jacek (pronounced ['j…ëÀêtsek]) comes from the Greek Hyakinthos (=ruler),:pl:Jacek which is equivalent to the English Hyacinth(e). The Polish 'Jan' (pronounced ['j…ëÀên]) is equivalent to English 'John'. Most prominent representatives The most famous Yatskos in Russia are football player Aleksandr Yatsko, Meritorious Artists of Russia Aleksandr Yatsko (–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –Ø—Ü–∫–æ)Aleksandr Yatsko and Igor Yatsko (–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å –Ø—Ü–∫–æ);Igor Yatsko Viatcheslav Yatsko, an expert in computational linguistics;Yatsko's Computational Linguistics Laboratory Ivan Vasilievich Yatsko, a high-ranking officer in the Russian Imperial Army. The most prominent representative of this surname in the USA is Gregory Jaczko, Chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The surname must be distinguished from the first name. Prince Yatsko Kepenik mentioned in chronicles as the Chief of rebels who struggled against German invaders in the 12th century–ê–ª—å–±—Ä–µ—Ö—Ç –ú–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥—å is sure to have nothing in common with the contemporary Yatskos because 'Yatsko' was his first name. Actually, 'Yatsko' is an evidence of peasant origin: Russian peasants, who till the abolition of serfdom didn't have surnames, adopted first names as surnames. This surname has never been registered in the lists of Russian or Polish gentry.

He is cited many times in the Jerusalem Talmud, where he is mentioned simply as Rav Jeremiah, without his patronymic name.The identity of the two is proven in comparison between the Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 12b, and its equivalent in the Jerusalem Talmud, Shabbat 1:3. SomeSefer Yuhasin identify Jeremiah bar Abba with Jeremiah Rabbah (Rabbah = \\"the Great\\") ,Cited once in the Talmud: Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 29b a sage who lived in Basra. According to this assertion he also lived in Basra. Biography Little is known about Jeremiah's family: His father was named \\"Abba\\", and was a famous Baal teshuva of his generation. (According to another version: the brother of his father, called \\"Aha\\" was the famous Baal teshuva).Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 56a Huna b. Hiyya (of Pumbdita) was his son-in-law,Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 156a; Hullin 93a and his son and grandson are also mentioned as sages.Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot, 26a, 31a For a certain period of time he lived in a place called Shumtamya, which is not known from any other sources. His son was the rabbi Raba Bar Jeremiah. Jeremiah was primarily a student of Rav, and usually acted in accordance with his rulings.Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 12b, Pesahim 106b However, he was considered as a Fellow Student of his, and would address him in a second, and third Grammatical person form as is common among students and rabbis.Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 27b Jeremiah debates many known contemporary scholars: Rav Huna, Judah ben Ezekiel and more. Rav Nachman once addressed him in a matter of a Jewish law.Babylonian Talmud, Bava Batra 153a Most of his references in the Talmud are laws delivered by him in the name of the most prominent scholars of his generation: Rav, Samuel of Nehardea, and Yochanan bar Nafcha. Several times he reports that the beit midrash of Rav asked questions to Samuel after the death of Rav, and gives Samuel's answer.Yitzhak Isaac Halevy Rabinowitz, Dorot Harishonim, ch. 43 Jeremiah bar Abba II Some are of the opinion that there were two sages named Jeremiah bar Abba, one in the second Amora generation, and the other in the third generation,Tosafot to Pesahim 106b; Yitzhak Isaac Halevy Rabinowitz, Dorot Harishonim, part 5, p. 229; Aaron Hyman, Toldoth Tannaim Ve'Amoraim, Article: Jeremiah b. Abba This is based on the words of Ulla, that Jeremiah was the student of Rav Huna, the pupil of Rav.Babylonian Talmud, Kiddushin 46a According to that opinion, the statements of Jeremiah in the name of Yochanan bar Nafcha belong to the latter one.

Alferenko is an Honorary Citizen of New Orleans, San Francisco, San Diego, Atlanta, Juneau, and Seattle. Education and career Gennady Alferenko studied Geology and Geophysics at the Novosibirsk State University from 1966 through 1973. During this period, in 1970, Alferenko founded Terpsichore, a ballet club, which was the first local community organization registered as a legal entity in the USSR. Terpsichore organized events with performances of Soviet and world culture stars, such as Galina Ulanova, Maya Plisetskaya, Ekaterina Maximova, Alicia Alonso, Vladimir Vasiliev, Maris Liepa, and Mikhail Baryshnikov. Also, he established a network of 450 local foundations to provide financial, organizational, and legal support to youth initiatives across the Soviet Union. From 1973 through 1985 Gennady Alferenko headed the NSU's oil and gas deposits research team in Eastern Siberia and on Sakhalin island. In 1985, following Alferenko's publication on an idea of a national campaign to facilitate innovators and change-makers, Mikhail Gorbachev pledged his support and invited Gennady to Moscow to set up a national fund promoting social innovations. Alferenko established the Foundation for Social Inventions at the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, as a readers' voluntary association, to implement initiatives facilitating creation and establishment of an open civil society. The Foundation for Social Inventions established and provided organizational and financial support to over 300 non-governmental organizations using a unique mandate to launch new organizations under its auspices. Some of the initiatives that Gennady Alferenko launched with the FSI, were Siberia-Alaska in 1988, and Space Flight Europe-America 500 in 1992. Siberia-Alaska was a project to establish a visa- free travel regime for native families in order to reunite Soviet and American Yupik Eskimos in Chukotka, and open direct flights between Siberia, Russian Far East, Alaska and California. Before, those who wished to travel legally across the Bering Strait had to go round the world. Europe-America 500 was the first ever private spaceflight which was conceived with the aim to promote the use of technology once reserved for military forces. It was followed by a Russian-American entrepreneur exchange program promoting development of small and medium-sized businesses in Russia. During the course of the program, over 10.000 young unemployed people had been sent for 4-6-week internships in the United States for developing entrepreneurial skills and gaining experience. In 1987, Gennady Alferenko established the US Foundation for Social Innovations, which, jointly with the FSI of the USSR, launched the first student exchange programs between the USSR and the USA for 100.000 students, and organized a meeting of the Vietnam War US veterans and Afghanistan War Soviet veterans to develop mutual support programs and establish joint business ventures, such as manufacturing of prosthetics and wheelchairs. In 1989, Alferenko together with the Esalen Institute organized Boris Yeltsin's first trip to the United States, arranging meetings for Yeltsin with President George H. W. Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, former President Ronald Reagan, and many other leaders in business and government. The trip covered eleven cities and fulfilled Yeltsin's dreams of seeing the Statue of Liberty and an example of a free enterprise economy. In mid-1990s, Alferenko had developed recommendations for Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to establish a state-owned company Rosneft. At the time, he had also been a founder and president of the club of friends of the Bolshoi Theatre. In 2000, Alferenko organized Ring-2000, a civic initiative to create a National idea bank for the new President of Russia, Vladimir Putin. The main events were held in Russia concert hall in Moscow linked with 33 Internet centers in universities across Russia, and were broadcast on national TV. Since 2000, Gennady Alferenko has been a member of board of directors of Standard Bank, a board member of Valery Gergiev Charitable Foundation, and strategic advisor to national and international companies such as Gazprombank, Ernst & Young, DLA Piper, and PwC.

Murat had Sofu Mehmed Pasha exiled and then executed.  First term as Grand Vizier  At the time of Murat's appointment as Grand Vizier, the sultan was only seven years old and the two Valide sultans (his mother Turhan Hatice and grandmother K√∂sem), who were acting as regents, were locked in a power struggle. While K√∂sem supported Murat, Turhan Hatice was against him. Moreover, the leaders of the Janissaries, Murat's former colleagues, were also against him. Feeling that his life was in danger, Murat resigned on 5 August 1650.Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye tarihi Cilt III, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991 p 103-104 Upon his suggestion, he was succeeded by Melek Ahmed Pasha. After his resignation, Murat was appointed as the governor of Budin (modern Budapest, Hungary). In 1653, he returned to Istanbul and was appointed Kapudan Pasha (grand admiral) and tasked with transporting reinforcements and ammunition to Crete by sea. The Venetian navy was blockading the Dardanelles Strait at the time, but Murat managed to defeat the Venetians and break their blockade in the First Battle of the Dardanelles.  Second term as Grand Vizier and death  Murat Pasha was reappointed as the Grand Vizier on 11 May 1655. His second term was very short; due to economic problems as well as opposition from the Janissaries, he had to resign on 19 August 1655. He was then appointed to the governorship of the Damascus Eyalet in Syria, but along the way to take up the post, he fell ill and died. In the five years between his two terms as Grand Vizier, six different pashas were appointed to the office, an indication of the political instability of the empire in the mid-17th century.

CBP and P300 are histone acetyltransferases (EC) that catalyse the reversible acetylation of all four histones in nucleosomes, acting to regulate transcription via chromatin remodelling. These large nuclear proteins interact with numerous transcription factors and viral oncoproteins, including p53 tumour suppressor protein, E1A oncoprotein, MyoD, and GATA-1, and are involved in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Both CBP and P300 have two copies of the TAZ domain, one in the N-terminal region, the other in the C-terminal region. The TAZ1 domain of CBP and P300 forms a complex with CITED2 (CBP/P300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail), inhibiting the activity of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1alpha) and thereby attenuating the cellular response to low tissue oxygen concentration. Adaptation to hypoxia is mediated by transactivation of hypoxia-responsive genes by hypoxia- inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in complex with the CBP and p300 transcriptional coactivators. The TAZ domain adopts an all-alpha fold with zinc-binding sites in the loops connecting the helices. The TAZ1 domain in P300 and the TAZ2 (CH3) domain in CBP have each been shown to have four amphipathic helices, organised by three zinc-binding clusters with HCCC-type coordination.

It was once the ancient and medieval name of Barishal.  History  The history of Chandradwip goes back to the Pre-Pala Period. Chandradwip was successively ruled by the Mauryas, Guptas and the Palas. Towards the end of the 10th century A.D., the Chandra Dynasty gave this region a \\"distinct political identity.\\" The Chandras were succeeded by the Deva Dynasty. After a brief period of confusion, the Deva Dynasty occupied this region and established their capital at Kachua. They were followed by the Basu and Mitra Mazumdar families. During the latter's rule, Chandradwip was auctioned off. Until the 18th century A.D., the Hindu rulers of Chandradwip were independent. After that this kingdom became a Zamindari, while the greater part of Chandradwip was named Bakerganj after a Muslim adventurer, Bakar Khan. Chandradwip was one of the Hindu Kingdoms that survived the Muslim Invasion and Conquest. The presence of mighty rivers and canals prevented the Muslims from conquering this region. It maintained its independence under the Kayastha rulers. The prosperity of this kingdom reached its zenith during the time of Kandarpanarayan Rai. Many Chinese and European travelers left interesting accounts about this kingdom. The earliest Chinese accounts describe this region as \\" a famous place for the worship of the Hindu-Bauddha-Tantrik deity Tara\\" The Temple of Tara was situated near the seashore. It was visible from the sea. Chandragomin, the famous grammarian of the 6th century, wrote his hymns on Tara from this place. In a manuscript of 1015 A.D., the region of Chandradwip was mentioned with the Tara-Temple. It was there during the rule of the Chandra kings. During the Mughal Period, this region came to be known as Bakla-Chandradwip. Rabindranath Tagore wrote Bou Thakuranir Haath, a famous book about the Basu Maharani of Chandradwip which was later filmed as Bou Thakuranir Haat.

Barbara married Charles Aitken during World War I, meeting while they were employed at the War Trade Intelligence Department. They eventually moved to the county of Hampshire. Her works were inspired by the lectures of John Linton Myres and Henry Balfour, after which she began a Classical education and achieved distinction in the field of anthropology. She remained a student of Balfour, and her education spanned a fellowship at Oxford and as a student of Professor Hobhouse at the London School of Economics. Her papers were published in Man and read before the British Association. She took a position at the Pitt Rivers Museum to study for her diploma and remained associated with this institution when this was completed; a collection of her specimens held at the museum. She became a fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1907. From 1909 to 1913 she held a research fellowship at Somerville College, Oxford where she researched 'the nature of authority of chiefs and kings in uncivilized society'.Barbara Freire-Marreco (Mrs Robert Aitken) Her membership in the Folklore Society from 1926 was preceded by articles in its journal, for which she continued to contribute 'Scraps of English folklore', correspondence, and a 1959 study of \\"processes of localization and relocalization\\" of folklore.

This domain was first identified as a zinc finger at the C terminus of AN1 SWISSPROT, a ubiquitin-like protein in Xenopus laevis. The AN1-type zinc finger contains six conserved cysteines and two histidines that could potentially coordinate 2 zinc atoms. Certain stress- associated proteins (SAP) contain AN1 domain, often in combination with A20 zinc finger domains (SAP8) or C2H2 domains (SAP16). For example, the human protein Znf216 has an A20 zinc-finger at the N terminus and an AN1 zinc-finger at the C terminus, acting to negatively regulate the NFkappaB activation pathway and to interact with components of the immune response like RIP, IKKgamma and TRAF6. The interact of Znf216 with IKK-gamma and RIP is mediated by the A20 zinc-finger domain, while its interaction with TRAF6 is mediated by the AN1 zinc-finger domain; therefore, both zinc-finger domains are involved in regulating the immune response. The AN1 zinc finger domain is also found in proteins containing a ubiquitin-like domain, which are involved in the ubiquitination pathway. Proteins containing an AN1-type zinc finger include: *Ascidian posterior end mark 6 (pem-6) protein . *Human AWP1 protein (associated with PRK1), which is expressed during early embryogenesis. *Human immunoglobulin mu binding protein 2 (SMUBP-2), mutations in which cause muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1. AN1-type zinc finger domains are widely present across diverse euryarchaeota and thaumarchaeota, where they are often fused to membrane-associated peptidase domains such as the rhomboid family serine peptidase, transglutaminase-like thiol peptidases of the papain fold, and Zn-dependent metallopeptidases. Archaeal AN1 domains are also linked to transmembrane helices, and domains such as DNAJ and SCP/PR1. These fusions suggest membrane-associated roles for AN1 domain containing proteins in archaea, such as in proteolytic processing of polypeptides and in regulating protein folding or stability. The architectural syntax is remarkably similar to that of the prokaryotic B-box zinc finger and LIM domains.

He was a Liberal Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 2011 to 2019. He was Government whip in the Legislative Council for five years, before resigning in March 2016 to protest new legislation regarding the sale of E10 ethanol fuel, which he called \\"an egregious breach\\" of Liberal Party core values. Early life Phelps was born at Camden District Hospital to Robert and Gwen Phelps. He spent his early years in Bradbury, New South Wales, and attending the Bradbury Infants School. Later his family moved to the Sydney inner-western suburbs of Camperdown and then Dulwich Hill. He attended Camperdown Demonstration School, opportunity classes at Summer Hill Public School, Fort Street High School and the University of Sydney, where he resided at St Paul's College. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in History in 1990 and a PhD in Australian History in 1997. Political activity Phelps contested the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Drummoyne in the 1999 election. Before entering Parliament, Phelps worked as an adviser to various Liberal politicians: Ian McLachlan (1998), John Moore (1998‚Äì99), Senator Chris Ellison (1999‚Äì2000), Senator Eric Abetz (2001‚Äì06), Gary Nairn (2006‚Äì07), Senator Michael Ronaldson (2009‚Äì10) and Bronwyn Bishop (2010‚Äì11). He was ninth on the coalition Legislative Council ticket at the 2011 election and was elected 16th. He was again ninth on the coalition Legislative Council ticket at the 2019 election however he was not re-elected. He was a Member of the State Executive of the Liberal Party and the Chairman of the Constitution Standing Committee. He has also been on numerous other parliamentary committees. Phelps's entry at the website of the NSW Parliament says: \\"Dr Phelps is a libertarian with social conservative tendencies, placing him within the 'fusionist' school of conservative political philosophy. His political hero is Ronald Reagan.\\" Controversies Phelps was Nairn's chief of staff during the 2007 federal election, at which Nairn lost his seat of Eden-Monaro to the Labor candidate, Dr Mike Kelly. During the campaign he attended a Kelly campaign meeting in Queanbeyan. From the audience he asked Kelly, a former Army officer, why he had served in the Iraq War when Labor had opposed that war. Kelly replied \\"I was a soldier, and I did what I was ordered to do.\\" Phelps then said: \\"Oh, like the guards at Belsen, perhaps? Are you using the Nuremberg Defence?\\" The following week in federal Parliament, responding to a Labor question about Phelps's comments, Nairn said: \\"I would not agree with any comments that might compare the work of Australian soldiers with those in Nazi Germany.\\" The ABC reported that \\"Peter Phelps has written to Mike Kelly, unreservedly withdrawing his inappropriate comments and regretting any offence.\\" In 2011, Phelps made a speech in which he compared scientists who believe in global warming to those who worked for totalitarian regimes. He said it should not be forgotten that \\"some of the strongest supporters of totalitarian regimes in the last century have been scientists... We should not be so surprised that the contemporary science debate has become so debased,\\" he said. \\"At the heart of many scientists ‚Äì but not all scientists ‚Äì lies the heart of a totalitarian planner.\\" This was reported as \\"Upper house whip under fire for Nazi slur on scientists,\\" although Phelps did not use the word \\"Nazi.\\" In 2013, on the 40th anniversary of the military coup in Chile, Phelps, in a speech in the NSW Parliament, said that he supported the overthrow of Salvador Allende. Phelps' comments were controversial, with the Labor Party and Greens calling for Premier Barry O'Farrell to reprimand or sack Phelps for his comments. He was neither sacked nor reprimanded.

Education Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City, John R. Cobb attended the Staunton Military Academy in Virginia, and enlisted on a merchant ship at the age of 16 years. He studied English Literature at Brown University in Providence Rhode Island and earned the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Literature in 1925. In his senior year at Brown he decided on a career in medicine and attended Harvard University for one year of post-graduate study in biological sciences. He then attended Yale Medical School, from which he graduated with an MD (Doctor of Medicine) in 1930. He served a one-year surgical internship and a one-year medical residency in orthopedic surgery at Yale ‚Äì New Haven Hospital. In 1934 Dr. Cobb became the Gibney Orthopedic Fellow at the Hospital for the Ruptured and Crippled in New York. In 1936 he received a Doctor of Medical Sciences degree from Columbia University. Work During his work after 1934 at the Hospital for Ruptured and Crippled (today: Hospital for Special Surgery) in New York City, Dr. Cobb developed and led the Margaret Caspary scoliosis clinic. At this time, not much was known about scoliosis or its cause, and there were few effective treatments available. Cobb experimented with various methods and concluded that the most effective approach was to use a turnbuckle plaster jacket in combination with spinal fusion. His studies of thousands of patients showed that only 10% of patients with scoliosis require such surgery. To obtain an accurate and consistent assessment of the severity of spinal deformity, so as to avoid unnecessary surgery, Cobb developed the simple and reliable method for measuring the angle of curvature which has now come to be known as the Cobb angle.

She made one voyage from England to Australia in 1791 carrying convicts. Later, she made one voyage for the East India Company (EIC). Subsequently she sailed to Smyrna, Surinam, and Gibraltar, before she disappeared from records in 1810. Career In 1783 she was under the command of Captain Edward Redman. Under his command, she traded between London and Jamaica. In 1789 Atlantic was under the command of Captain Muirhead. She was trading between London and Archangel.Lloyd's Register, 1789. =Convict transport= Under the command of Archibald Armstrong, master, Atlantic departed Portsmouth on 27 March 1791 as part of the third fleet, and arrived on 20 August 1791 in Port Jackson, New South Wales. She transported 220 male convicts, 18 of whom died during the voyage. The Naval Agent on board was Lieutenant Richard Bowen, and the surgeon was James Thompson. Provisions in the colony were in short supply. Governor Phillip, therefore, took the Atlantic into the service as a naval transport. She left Port Jackson on 26 October 1791, bound for Bengal.Hunter, Chapter XXIII Atlantic returned to Port Jackson from Calcutta on 20 June 1792. She then made a return voyage to Norfolk Island, arriving back in Port Jackson on 30 Sep 1792. On 11 December 1792 she departed Port Jackson for England. She was carrying the retiring governor Arthur Phillip, accompanied by the Aboriginal Australians Bennelong and his friend Yemmerrawanne. Also on board were the last of the First Fleet New South Wales Marine Corps detachment, including diarist John Easty. =East India Company= In 1795 Thomas Probeart was Atlantics captain, and her occupation was listed as a transport sailing out of London.Lloyd's Register, 1795. Then Atlantic sailed to India for the East India Company. War with France had commenced in 1793, and during her employment with the EIC and subsequently she sailed under a letter of marque, which gave her the right to act offensively against the French, should the opportunity arise, and not just defensively. That is, the letter authorized her to capture French vessels. Probeart received a letter of marque on 26 December 1796. Captain Probert [sic], sailed past Dungeness on 5 February 1797, bound for Madras, Penang, and Bengal. On 2 May Atlantic reached the Cape, and on 20 June Madras. From there she sailed to Penang, which she reached on 23 August. She was at Penang on 27 September and also on 12 October. This to-and-fro was a consequence of the EIC and the Royal Navy preparing an expedition against Manila that then did not take place. (A peace treaty with Spain ended the plan.) Atlantics owners charged the EIC ¬£7,600 7s 2d for her services as a transport.The Asiatic annual register or a view of the history of Hindustan and of the politics, commerce and literature of Asia, Volume 7 (1805), pp.53-60. Atlantic left Penang on 26 November. She reached Madras on 11 December, and Colombo on 8 January 1798. From there she sailed on to Calcutta, which she reached on 28 February. Homeward-bound, she left Calcutta, passing Kedgeree on 1 November. She reached the Cape on 19 January 1799, and St Helena on 16 February. She arrived at Long Reach on 17 July.British Library: Atlantic. =Subsequent career= In 1799 Atlantics captain was Alexander Muirhead, who received a letter of marque on 31 August 1799. Earlier that year, on 19 April, he was captain of the Eurydice, which was in Bengal with a cargo for the EIC. Under Muirhead, Atlantic traded between London and Smyrna.Lloyd's Register, 1799 & 1800. After Smyrna, she sailed to Surinam.Lloyd's Register (1801). In 1803 Captain Curzans replaced Muirhead and sailed Atlantic to Gibraltar.Lloyd's Register, 1803. After the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars, Sampson Baker became Atlantics captain; he received a letter of marque on 8 June 1803.

He was also a member of several academies and institutes in Italy and abroad, serving for several years as president of the International Statistical Institute. His scientific research was on both methodological and applied statistics, particularly on demography, anthropometry, and economics. As a statistician, he has been particularly interested to the foundations of the method, and he proposed a view of statistics as an empirical history of all the positive sciences. To deepen these researches he founded a statistical Laboratory at the Catholic University of Milan. The results are widely discussed in the volumes, Statistica: Teoria e metodi (first edition, 1942), and Teoria della Statistica (1963), that have been studied by thousands of students. For Boldrini, Statistics is a formal science like mathematics and logic, but it is different from them as a scientific inquiry method in the inductive and deductive phases of research. Beyond academic commitment, he also had several management positions in the state oil industry: he was first named president of Agip (1948‚Äì1953), was then vice-president of ENI (1953‚Äì1962), before succeeding Enrico Mattei as president in 1962, remaining in the post until 1967.

Appendix A.2 gives a brief biography of Benini; pp. 261‚Äì263. Biography At the beginning of his university career, Rodolfo Benini taught a history of commerce course at the University of Bari (1889‚Äì1895). Then he became a professor of economics at the University of Perugia (1896), a professor of statistics at the University of Pavia (1897‚Äì1907) and at the Bocconi University of Milan (1905‚Äì1909). Finally, he moved to the University of Rome, where he was the first professor of statistics (1908‚Äì1928) and then professor of political economy (1928‚Äì1935). Benini held various positions at the national and international levels, including president of the Higher Council of Statistics and of the Commission of Statistics and Law at the Ministry of Justice. He also represented the Italian Government at the Geneva Conference in 1921 and served as the president of the Commission of Statistics at the General Assembly for the World Agriculture Census in 1926. Benini used economic and demographic empirical studies with the aim of constructing tools of general validity. In this context, we may include the study of the relations between the distribution of particular economic phenomena and the distribution of more general phenomena such as income or patrimony. His pioneering book Principles of Statistics (1906) contains his main contributions and successfully combines statistical methodology into a unified theory. In this way, Benini tried to give statistics an autonomous role in relation to economics, demography, and social sciences, with which it often became confused at the end of nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century. Among Benini's major original contributions we may mention, for example, the attraction indices, the extension to the patrimonies of the Paretian laws of income, and a probabilistic study of factors determining the proportion of the sexes in twins. Benini was an Italian Academician (1932), an honorary member of ISTAT, a member of Istituto Veneto di Scienze Lettere ed Arti, and a member of the Italian Geographical Society.

Hubert Goltz or Goltzius (30 October 1526 - 24 March 1583) was a Renaissance painter, engraver, and printer from the Southern Netherlands. He is not to be confused with the much more famous Hendrik Goltzius, who was his cousin, once removed. Life The early Flemish biographer Karel van Mander states in his Schilder-boeck (1604) that Goltzius was born in Venlo from parents who were originally from Wurzburg.Hubert Goltz in: Karel van Mander, Het Schilder-boeck, 1604 He was a pupil of Lambert Lombard. He spent 12 years in Antwerp working on a book of engravings of antiquities, called \\"Medaglien oft tronien der Roomsche Keysers\\" (medallions or busts of Roman emperors). Goltzius was married more than once. His first wife was Lysbeth Verhulst. Lysbeth Verhulst was the sister of Mayken Verhulst and Barbara Verhulst, who were respectively married to the painters Pieter Coecke van Aelst and Jacob de Punder.Jacques de Punder at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Goltzius would occasionally collaborate on commissions with his brother-in-law Jacob de Punder.J.

In 1567 he published the book \\"Fastos\\" for which he was made an honorary Roman citizen by the Rome council (and which was noted in his next book called \\"Caesar Augustus\\" in 1574). He published his final book in 1576 on the emperors of Greece in medallions. His portrait was painted twice by Antonis Mor in exchange for his medallion book. These paintings, as well as the books, were all honored in verse by various poets. The same goes for the engraved portrait by Melchior Lorck, used in his last book from 1576 and also used independently.Portrait of Hubert Goltzius; bust-length, in profile to right; set in an oval frame, 1574, engraving, at the British Museum He painted a \\"Last Judgement\\" in the tribunal of the city hall of Venlo in 1557, which is still installed there.Hubert Goltzius at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He travelled to Italy in the years 1558-1560, and made a trip to Germany in 1570.

The MYND domain (myeloid, Nervy, and DEAF-1) is present in a large group of proteins that includes RP-8 (PDCD2), Nervy, and predicted proteins from Drosophila, mammals, Caenorhabditis elegans, yeast, and plants. The MYND domain consists of a cluster of cysteine and histidine residues, arranged with an invariant spacing to form a potential zinc-binding motif. Mutating conserved cysteine residues in the DEAF-1 MYND domain does not abolish DNA binding, which suggests that the MYND domain might be involved in protein- protein interactions. Indeed, the MYND domain of ETO/MTG8 interacts directly with the N-CoR and SMRT co-repressors. Aberrant recruitment of co-repressor complexes and inappropriate transcriptional repression is believed to be a general mechanism of leukemogenesis caused by the t(8;21) translocations that fuse ETO with the acute myelogenous leukemia 1 (AML1) protein. ETO has been shown to be a co-repressor recruited by the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein. A divergent MYND domain present in the adenovirus E1A binding protein BS69 was also shown to interact with N-CoR and mediate transcriptional repression. The current evidence suggests that the MYND motif in mammalian proteins constitutes a protein-protein interaction domain that functions as a co-repressor-recruiting interface.

Her first cap came the following month, replacing namesake Karen Walker during a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Italy in Viareggio. In May 2003 Walker made two further appearances during England's ill-fated tour of North America, starting two 4‚Äì0 defeats to Canada after sitting out a 6‚Äì0 humbling by United States. She also featured in friendlies against Australia and Germany later that year. In September 2003 an on-pitch altercation with Doncaster Belles' former Charlton Athletic player Carly Hunt saw a red card for Walker. Days later the incident spilled over into an England training session, resulting in lengthy bans for twins Carly and Gemma Hunt, as well as Walker and her Charlton teammate Eartha Pond. Walker was recalled to the National squad after serving the suspension. Her sixth and final appearance for England came as a half time substitute for club mate Amanda Barr in a 1‚Äì0 friendly win over Iceland in May 2004.

Numerous inscriptions have been found in the ancient synagogues in Palestine and Israel; the vast majority, 140, of these are in Aramaic, with another 50 in Greek and only a few in Hebrew. History Most of the synagogues unearthed in archaeological excavations in Israel, the State of Palestine (West Bank and Gaza Strip) and the Golan Heights date from the Roman and Byzantine periods, from the third to seventh centuries. Synagogues from before the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE include Gamla, Masada and Herodium. The oldest remains of a Palestinian synagogue date from the 1st century CE. After the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, the local synagogue became its substitute and from Late Antiquity onward, the number of synagogues discovered rise significantly, with over one hundred being unearthed in Palestine alone. Over fifty of these are situated in Galilee and on the Golan Heights. A survey conducted in the 1970s found that of the known synagogue inscriptions, 67 were in Greek and found in the coastal and major inland cities. Another 54 were in Aramaic, and 14 in Hebrew. The vast majority of inscriptions are dedicatory, while the remainder feature literary sources or are short labels for images. Decorations used on mosaic floors, capitals and lintels were symbolic of the Temple service and included the menorah, lulav and etrog. Lions were depicted to represent the power of God. Aside from remains found in-situ, architectural elements of the synagogues are often found to have been reused in the houses of adjacent villages.Raphael Greenberg, Adi Keinan. Israeli Archaeological Activity in the West Bank 1967‚Äì2007: A Sourcebook , Ostracon 2009. pg. 136. . Sometimes dressed stones were transferred further afield and lintels from the doorways of ancient Palestinian synagogues are also to be found in contemporary homes in Syria. The earliest synagogue inscription uncovered to date is the Theodotus inscription; it is in Greek and dates to the first century BCE or the first century CE. It was discovered in the City of David, just south of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. All of the early synagogues were purpose-built and many synagogues dating to the talmudic era onwards had annexes attached to the main structure, indicating that synagogues additionally functioned as a communal centres. Some modern-day synagogue architects have relied upon synagogue architecture in ancient Palestine in an attempt to create an \\"identifiably Jewish style\\" of synagogue design. The Henry S. Frank Memorial Synagogue in Philadelphia was inspired by the remains of the synagogue at Kfar Bar'am. Second Temple period synagogues Before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE, synagogues served a different purpose that after that event. Several examples of such early synagogues from the time and territory of the Hasmonean and Herodian dynasties until 70 CE have been excavated in pre-1967 Israel, on the West Bank, and one on the Golan Heights. Some are recognised as synagogues by a larger part of the scientific community, while some are very controversial. They all share only a certain number of architectural characteristics with the better- accepted post-destruction synagogues.Rachel Hachlili, \\"Synagogues: Before and After the Roman Destruction of the Temple\\" , Biblical Archaeology Review 41:03, May/June 2015 Here is a list of all the structures from the Land of Israel/Palestine region discovered as of July 2018 and interpreted by some as Second Temple Period synagogues.

Davey was a left-handed batsman who bowled left-arm fast-medium. An opening bowler, Davey had a successful career with Gloucestershire County Cricket Club which spanned from the 1966 season to the 1978 season. His name sometimes appeared in reports and on scorecards as J.J. Davey, although this was not accurate: the second initial was a mischievous creation by his county captain Tony Brown and the writer Alan Gibson, whose campaign to embellish Davey's name even extended to the production of a commemorative tie, in Davey's testimonial season, with \\"J.J?\\" on it.Alan Gibson, Growing Up with Cricket, George Allen & Unwin, London, 1985, p. 112. Early life Born in Tavistock, Davey was the son of an auctioneer's clerk who played and administered club cricket for over 30 years, as well as playing for Devon. He was educated at Tavistock Grammar School, where when playing cricket for the school, as well as in his early club cricket days, Davey wanted to be a slow left-arm bowler. It wasn't until when he was playing for his village club side, Milton Abbot, that the team found itself short of a seam bowler. Davey, who at the time was 14, was given the new ball. He performed so well in his new role, that for the rest of his career he would become a seam bowler. Upon leaving school, he began an apprenticeship as a compositor for the Tavistock Gazette. After performing well in club cricket, he later made his debut in county cricket for Devon in the 1964 Minor Counties Championship against Cornwall. Davey played Minor counties cricket for Devon on four more occasions in 1965. Gloucestershire It was in 1965 that he came to Gloucestershire's attention, appearing for the county Second XI on a couple of occasions in that year. The following season, Davey made his first-class debut for the county against Cambridge University, although he spent the majority of 1966 in the county Second XI. 1967 saw Davey establish himself in the Gloucestershire team, making regular first-class appearances, as well as making his List A debut against Lancashire in the Gillette Cup. His first full season playing for Gloucestershire was a successful one, with his left-arm bowling taking 60 wickets at a bowling average of 27.65. He took his first five wicket haul, one of two that season, against Surrey when he took 5/40. However, it was in that season that he took his career best bowling figures, 6/95 against Nottinghamshire. Standing over 6 feet tall, Davey was an opening bowler, often sharing the new ball with South Africa Test cricketer Mike Procter, who had joined Gloucestershire in the season before Davey's debut. With South Africa being banned from international cricket due to their governments apartheid policies, this ended Procter's international career, thus allowing him and Davey to form a highly productive partnership over the next decade. Throughout the 1970s, Davey played an important support role for Procter, taking over 40 wickets in 1971 and 1972, plus chipping in with 26 in 1973. Davey was just as successful in the limited- overs arena. He was played in the famous semi-final of the 1971 Gillette Cup, which didn't end until five-to-nine, with Davey bowling 11 overs for the cost of 22 runs. Despite this, Lancashire won the match and proceeded to the final. He considers this the bowling performance he is most proud of. Davey made a notable performance in the semi-final of the 1972 Benson & Hedges Cup against Yorkshire, when he bowled 9 overs, conceding just 6 runs. 7 of his maiden overs came with Geoffrey Boycott at one end, a batsman though not known for his fast scoring rate. He won the 1973 Gillette Cup with Gloucestershire, playing through the majority of the tournament with painkilling injections in both his knees, a fact kept quiet among his contemporaries in cricket. The lumps of fat under both his kneecaps were removed in an operation, which caused Davey to miss a large part of the 1974 season. He consistently averaged in the mid to low twenties with the ball in hand between over 20 wickets for 4 straight seasons from 1972 to 1974. Following his most successful first-class season in 1975, in which he took 64 wickets at an average of 26.26, which included his highest quantity of five wicket hauls, claiming 5 of them in 20 matches. However, after the 1976 season, in which his bowling performances dipped in both forms of the game when compared to preceding seasons, he played less often for Gloucestershire thereafter. With his time at the county coming to an end, Davey had his benefit year in 1978, alongside teammate and close friend David Shepherd. He did though make 15 first-class appearances in his last season in 1978, taking 30 wickets at a respectable average of exactly 30. His final first-class match came against Yorkshire at North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough. This was his 175th first-class match for Gloucestershire. His career with Gloucestershire spanned 13 seasons, during which time he took 411 wickets at an average of 28.51, with Davey taking a five wicket haul on 9 occasions, although he never took a ten wicket haul in a match. Davey generally batted at number 11 in the Gloucestershire batting order, and was well known as a blocker. An example of his defensive nature came against Glamorgan on the last day of the 1973 season. Davey came to the crease with Gloucestershire 210/9, still requiring 57 runs to win. Davey scored 17 runs off 94 balls, supporting number 10 John Mortimore, who scored the majority of the runs in their partnership as Gloucestershire went on to win. He scored 918 runs during his first-class career, at a batting average of 7.77. He made a solitary half century, which came against Glamorgan in 1977, which was his only first-class appearance that season. His final season also saw him play 9 List A matches, the last coming against Lancashire in the 2nd round of the 1978 Gillette Cup. His List A career with the county spanned 12 season, during which time he took 170 wickets at an average of 26.21, with best figures of 4/11. Later life With the end of his career with Gloucestershire, Davey embarked on new pursuits. In an interview for the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1975, he stated his desire to become a heavy goods vehicle driver on a full-time basis, having worked as one for the winters of 1973 and 1974 after acquiring his licence. In previous winters he had worked as a carpet salesman in Bristol, where he had made his home with his wife, Melora, who herself was originally from Princetown, Devon. The end of his professional cricketing career did not bring an end to his cricketing endeavours. He appeared for Devon in a single Minor Counties Championship match in 1981 against Cornwall, as well as making 2 List A appearances in the 1983 NatWest Trophy against Leicestershire and Warwickshire in the 1985 NatWest Trophy. He later ran the Court Farm pub in Abbotskerswell for many years. Davey appeared in the 1997 documentary Grace & Favour: A Portrait of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, alongside former teammates Zaheer Abbas and David Allen, and later Gloucestershire player Mark Alleyne. In 2009, he appeared in a short comedy film entitled Dow Jones, where he played the part of Dow Jones' girlfriend. When his lifelong friend and former teammate David Shepherd died, Davey described him as being \\"like a brother\\". At the time of Shepherd's funeral, Davey was semi-retired and living in Topsham, Devon.

Destined to succeed his father, he nevertheless left his home for Paris when he was 12, and ended up in the Bic√™tre Prison. He was released at the coronation of Louis XVI of France in 1774, but in 1776, after the death of his parents, M√©h√©e was again imprisoned in the Bic√™tre. He escaped when he was sent to Brest to serve on the French fleet. He returned to Paris and was sent to Saint Petersburg as a spy under the name Chevalier de La Touche by Honor√© Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau and Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette. He was soon uncovered and was sent out of Russia in March 1791. His next appointment as a spy was in Poland, where he established the Gazette de Varsovie, a French newspaper in Warsaw. Again his role as a spy was discovered, and he was banished from Poland as well. He returned to Paris, and became a member of the Cordeliers and the Jacobin Club in 1792. He took part in the attack on the Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792. That same evening, he was pronounced Secretary of the Paris Commune, and organised the September Massacres at the start of the next month, together with Sulpice Huguenin and Jean-Lambert Tallien. La Touche then became the secretary of Jean-Lambert Tallien, and in November 1795 was appointed First Secretary to the Minister of the War Department of the French Directory. Soon afterwards he held the same function in the Foreign Department under Charles-Fran√ßois Delacroix. He resigned in April 1796, and became editor of the Journal des Hommes Libres. In 1797, after the Coup of 18 Fructidor, he was convicted to be transported to Cayenne, together with Charles Pichegru, Fran√ßois-Marie, marquis de Barth√©lemy and thirteen others. He ran from justice, and after a few months was pardoned. In 1799, Bonaparte sent him to the Temple Prison, but he was again released in 1801. He started the philosophical and atheist weekly magazine L'Antidote in 1802. He was again arrested, and banished to Dijon and then to Ol√©ron. He escaped from there, and became a French spy in England to report on French emigrants opposed against Napoleon. He posed as a counter-revolutionary, and convinced the royalists in England that France was waiting to overthrow Bonaparte. In 1804 de La Touche revealed the plot, and the support it received from Francis Drake, the minister to the Perpetual Diet of Regensburg. After the fall of Napoleon in 1815, he was no longer welcome in France and fled first to Switzerland and then to Brussels, where in 1817 he worked as the editor of Le Vrai Liberal. He was apprehended there, but escaped again the next day. He then moved to K√∂nigsberg, until he was allowed to return to France in 1819. In 1823 he was living in Paris, where he died in poverty in 1826. Bibliography Meh√©e de La Touche was a prolific writer of pamphlets, essays, articles, letters, and books. Much of his production appeared in magazines and journals he created or was editor for. An early pamphlet by him was La Queue de Robespierre (The Tail of Robespierre) of 1793, printed in 70,000 copies. It was followed by a.o. Suite √† la Queue de Robespierre, Rendez-moi ma Queue, and Defends la Queue. These pamphlets were widely followed, and other people published similar ones, like the song La Queue, le T√™te et le Front de Robespierre by satirist Louis Ange Pitou.

Biography He graduated in law in 1862 at the University of Pavia. His devotion to the research is confirmed by two works published in 1871: Della propriet√†. Dissertazione (Pavia) e L'industria e la scienza. Discorso (Genova). In January 1878 he obtained the lectureship in statistics at the University of Pavia. When in Italy the chairs of statistics were still scarce and often were associated with the teaching of political economy, he tried to provide to Statistics the character of \\"Science\\" and \\"method\\", and to introduce mathematics in order to support statistical computations. The first work on methodological statistics due to Gabaglio appeared in the winter of 1880 and it was La storia e teoria della statistica, published in Milan by Hoepli. The study consisted of an extensive and detailed methodological section. The volume was met with broad consensus in the scientific world, and in February 1880, the technical education division of the Ministry of Education appointed Gabaglio as Cavaliere dell'Ordine dei Ss. Maurizio e Lazzaro. Strengthened by this recognition, he wrote in 1888 an opera entitled Teoria generale della statistica, again published by Hoepli. Gabaglio made a strong effort for the affirmation of the mathematical method in a discipline traditionally taught in the Faculty of Law. In the late 1980s, he left the Chair of statistics at the University of Pavia and returned to teach in the Technical Institute, from which he came. He died at Pavia on 14 November 1909. Considered one of the main researchers that transitioned the field of statistics from pure description of the facts to a scientific method based on mathematics. Gabaglio provided a new perspective in the development of the statistical method. He said \\"statistics may be interpreted in an extended and in a restricted sense. In the former sense it is a method, in the latter a science. As a science it studies the actual social-political order by means of mathematical induction.\\" Academic positions Teacher of Statistics and economic studies at the Tech Institute of Pavia (1868‚Äì1872), Teacher of Political economy, statistics, and scientific elements of civil ethic, and law at the Industrial and Professional Institute of Pavia (1873), Full Professor of Statistics at the Faculty of Law at the University of Pavia (1878).

The single species, Coloniatherium cilinskii, was a large member of the family Mesungulatidae.  Taxonomy  Coloniatherium was named in 2009 by Guillermo Rougier and colleagues and assigned to the family Mesungulatidae within the Dryolestoidea. Dryolestoidea is an extinct mammalian group that occurred in North America, Eurasia, and Africa during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, but survived in South America during the Late Cretaceous and into the Paleocene. The generic name, Coloniatherium, combines the name of the La Colonia Formation, the stratigraphical unit where fossils of the animal were found, and its namesake the Sierra de La Colonia with the Greek therion \\"beast\\". The specific name, cilinskii, honors Juan Cilinski, a local rancher who helped with the fieldwork that led to the discovery of Coloniatherium.  Description  Coloniatherium is known from a few jaw fragments, a number of isolated teeth, and some petrosals (ear bones). It was a large mesungulatid. The animal had an unknown number of incisors (probably two or three in the lower jaw), one canine, three premolars, and three molars per jaw quadrant. It is larger than Mesungulatum, has broader molars, and the back molars are more reduced; the two also differ in numerous details of tooth morphology. The first molar has three roots, a trait shared only with Leonardus from the approximately contemporaneous Los Alamitos Formation of Argentina among dryolestoids. The petrosal of Coloniatherium appears to be similar in terms of phylogenetic position to Vincelestes, an Early Cretaceous Argentinean mammal, but also share some apparently derived traits with therians (i.e., marsupials, placentals, and relatives). Based on comparisons with Vincelestes, the length of the skull of Coloniatherium would be estimated to be 87.5 mm (3.4 in); comparisons with therians suggest a larger skull length, but the former estimate is more in line with the size of the jaws.  Range and ecology  Fossils of Coloniatherium come from the La Colonia Formation, which outcrops in north-central Chubut Province. The mammalian fossils come from the Mirasol Chico valley. The formation includes fluvial (river), deep-sea, and near-shore deposits, and the mammalian fauna probably comes from an estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain. La Colonia Formation also contains dryolestoids, such as Coloniatherium and Reigitherium, as well as the enigmatic possible multituberculates Argentodites and Ferugliotherium. Coloniatherium is the largest and most abundant mammal found in the formation.

He lived for a period (1907‚Äì1908) in Berlin where he worked with L. von Bortkiewicz on probability theory and particularly on the law of rare events. He is famous also for the construction of statistical indices for measuring the conjuntural effects (economic barometers). Forced to leave Italy in 1939 for racial reasons, he moved to Brazil, where he was technical advisor of the National Census (1939‚Äì48) and then of the National Council of Statistics where he directed the laboratory (1949‚Äì57) and where he created a flourishing school of demography. In 1954 he was nominated president of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population, of which he became (1957) Honorary President. In 1956 he returned to teach to the University of Rome of which he was appointed professor emeritus in 1961.

Idents The original idents used when the station launched were slides with the words BBC TELEVISION SERVICE written in a stylised way. These slides also featured waved lines in different shades and a number of circles in the centre, suggesting that this slide could work in the same way as a Testcard. Slides of the BBC Coat of Arms were also shown. Upon war being declared on 1 September 1939, the Television Service was closed down, with all BBC output being made on Radio instead. Many of the staff at BBC Television went to work in the forces, or on the Chain Home Radar System. The BBC Television Service returned following the war on 7 June 1946 and continued with the same identification. =The Bat's Wings= The Bats Wings ident, the first BBC ident The ident they called the \\"Bat's Wings\\" was introduced on 2 December 1953. A new media needed a new way to brand itself, and this was it. It was a model made of piano wire, brass and flashing lights, created by Abram Games. it featured a spinning globe in the centre and two spinning eyes, each going in different directions. It also features two lightning bolts to either side which lit up with lightning flashes in time to the harp music.MHP Ident ZoneTransdiffusion Broadcasting System - Video of Startup and Symbol The model was filmed, rather than the live mechanics used later by the BBC, due to the models' delicate and temperamental nature, even breaking down after being filmed.Transdiffusion Broadcasting System - Baird - Oh, that Symbol The design itself was meant to represent, in the BBC's own words: \\"The abstract pattern consists of two intersecting eyes which scan the globe from north to south and east to west, symbolising vision and the power of vision. Flashes of lightning on either side represent electrical forces and the whole form takes the shape of wings which suggest the creative possibilities of television broadcasting\\" The Bat's wings were also accompanied by a clock, which featured a simplified Bat's wings design, with the clock face replacing the globe and eyes, and the intrequate lines that made up the bat's wing removed. The noticeable thing about this clock design is the length of the second hand. While the minute and hour hands never went outside the circle at the centre, the second hand went out as far as the bat's wings themselves, making the second hand easily twice as long as the minute hand.TBBC1 1950s - 1960s Idents at TVARK The clock was occasionally accompanied by the BBC Pips when a programme started on the hour. Another part of the look were the regional variations used by the, then few, Nations and Regions. Scotland's variation featured a shield with the Scottish flag inside replacing the eye and world. 'Scotland' was written between the wings at the top of the screen. The regions variation featured the bats wings shape, but with a large eye made up of lines going between both wings. The BBC North variation included the legend 'North of England' within this eye with 'BBC' and 'News' written between the wings above and below respectively. The BBC Midlands variant featured a stylised 'M' in the middle of the eye with midlands written in an eye shape within the 'M'. The BBC legend is written above. The BBC West variation included the same design as the midlands, but with a 'W' and the BBC legend at the bottom. The West region also included some areas of Wales at this point. Wales would not get its own service until 1964, however a number of viewers could receive services via overspill of the Wenvoe Transmitter. As part of the look, captions were also made featuring the Bat Wings outline on black captions, used to introduce the next programme, programmes for Schools and CollegesBBC Cult Flash Recreation and even the testcards used early in the BBC's existence were updated with the Bats Wings. =The Map= By the late 1950s and with the introduction of their new logo of square boxes with slanted letters a number of things changed. Firstly the clock design was changed c.1958 to two circles, one inside the other, containing the clock and the new logo. The large second hand was retained, reaching the larger of the two circles. The clock element itself was made larger and more consipcous. This was changed again on 8 October 1960 to a digital clock, featuring the BBC logo above a line, with the 'TV' box and time below. The Map logo itself was introduced c.1962 and featured the BBC logo in the middle of a circle containing a segmented map of the regions. This logo also had a variant of a plain circle with BBC logo, used for Breaking News. Regional variations were changed from this point to a similar design to that of the digital clock. The design featured the 'BBC TV' logo above a line with the region name below.BBC South at TVARKBBC South West at TVARK =The Globe= The First Globe symbol The, now famous, symbol of BBC Television, and later BBC One was the globe. The very first incarnation was introduced on 30 September 1963 and featured a large globe on its axis with the new slanted BBC logo with a background of black and white, split down the axis of the globe. The globe, like all that followed, spun. This was accompanied by the previous clock used in 1958 with modifications made, namely the logo updated and colours changed to greys. The large second hand was still retained. Alas this globe only lasted a little while, as it was replaced a few months later with a variation on the theme. Following the 1962 Pilkington Report that suggested that the third television station be awarded to the BBC, the BBC launched BBC2 on 20 April 1964. In preparation to this, all 'BBC TV' branding had to disappear from the presentation of the soon to be called BBC1. The Globe was made smaller, surrounded by a thich black circle and encompassed in a large white box on a grey background. There was also a slanted BBC logo in the bottom right corner. The lack of on screen branding is unusual, but as this ident began its life on BBC TV and ended on BBC1, the lack is justified. However the lack is also because BBC2 was unseen by many viewers: the new 625-line system meant new equipment had to be purchased and poor coverage meant few could view it. A clock also accompanied this look, with the same design as the globe, but with clock replacing the globe. It had a black background and normal length second hands. The next globe design was introduced on 18 April 1966, nicknamed the 'Watch Strap' it featured a smaller globe in the centre of screen with three stripes of grey and white running to the left and right, on a black background. It was also the first ident to use the name 'BBC1', using the slanted logo in white. The watchstrap globe also featured a clock, with the same design as the globe but with the clock in place of the globe. Alongside the look, a slide was used to introduce newsflashes, and featured a thick stripe, white on the left hand side and grey on the right, on a black background with a large angled '1' above the grey section and filling most of the screen. The strip held the slanted 'BBC TV' logo, with the BBC logo in the white section and the grey section containing the 'TV' logo.MHP Ident Zone BBC1 The final variation of the globe was introduced on 7 July 1968 and was a variation on the watchstrap theme. The globe now spins on a black background with a white stripe below containing a black BBC1 logo. This version was used only a few months until some time into 1969. It is unknown whether a new clock design accompanied the look, however it is more than likely that the clock was modified. The newer globe look appears to use the same model as the previous looks but with a modified legend and background, however we can't be certain.

These domains contain 4-6 Cys residues that participate in zinc binding (plus additional Ser/His residues), including a Cys-X2-Cys motif found in other zinc finger domains. These zinc fingers are thought to be involved in protein- protein interactions. The structure of the ZZ domain shows that it belongs to the family of cross-brace zinc finger motifs that include the PHD, RING, and FYVE domains. ZZ-type zinc finger domains are found in: *Transcription factors P300 and CBP. *Plant proteins involved in light responses, such as Hrb1. *E3 ubiquitin ligases MEX and MIB2 (EC). *Dystrophin and its homologues Single copies of the ZZ zinc finger occur in the transcriptional adaptor/coactivator proteins P300, in cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and ADA2. CBP provides several binding sites for transcriptional coactivators. The site of interaction with the tumour suppressor protein p53 and the oncoprotein E1A with CBP/P300 is a Cys-rich region that incorporates two zinc-binding motifs: ZZ-type and TAZ2-type. The ZZ-type zinc finger of CBP contains two twisted anti-parallel beta-sheets and a short alpha-helix, and binds two zinc ions. One zinc ion is coordinated by four cysteine residues via 2 Cys-X2-Cys motifs, and the third zinc ion via a third Cys-X-Cys motif and a His-X-His motif. The first zinc cluster is strictly conserved, whereas the second zinc cluster displays variability in the position of the two His residues. In Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress), the hypersensitive to red and blue 1 (Hrb1) protein, which regulating both red and blue light responses, contains a ZZ-type zinc finger domain. ZZ-type zinc finger domains have also been identified in the testis-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MEX that promotes death receptor-induced apoptosis. MEX has four putative zinc finger domains: one ZZ-type, one SWIM-type and two RING-type. The region containing the ZZ- type and RING-type zinc fingers is required for interaction with UbcH5a and MEX self-association, whereas the SWIM domain was critical for MEX ubiquitination. In addition, the Cys-rich domains of dystrophin, utrophin and an 87kDa post-synaptic protein contain a ZZ-type zinc finger with high sequence identity to P300/CBP ZZ-type zinc fingers. In dystrophin and utrophin, the ZZ-type zinc finger lies between a WW domain (flanked by and EF hand) and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Dystrophin is thought to act as a link between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, and perturbations of the dystrophin-associated complex, for example, between dystrophin and the transmembrane glycoprotein beta-dystroglycan, may lead to muscular dystrophy. Dystrophin and its autosomal homologue utrophin interact with beta-dystroglycan via their C-terminal regions, which are composed of a WW domain, an EF hand domain, and a ZZ-type zinc finger domain. The WW domain is the primary site of interaction between dystrophin or utrophin and dystroglycan, while the EF hand and ZZ-type zinc finger domains stabilise and strengthen this interaction.

He collaborated with artists such as Francisco Alves, Carmen Miranda, Aracy de Almeida and Noel Rosa and was particularly successful as a radio singer. Biography He graduated in Law and Social Sciences in the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro Faculty of Law, attending the same classes of Ary Barroso (LLB, 1929). He recorded many hits with Carmen Miranda and Francisco Alves, with whom also performed frequently in the 1930s, all of which are regarded as amongst the finest Brazilian singers of this period. He toured in Brazil and also Argentina. As a singer, he was known for his gentle tone, which compensated for the lack of vocal power. His singing style even today sounds modern and he is considered one of the pioneers of bossa nova. Many believe his singing influenced Jo√£o Gilberto. He spent many years away from singing career and returned years later to make records. In 1965 and 1971 he recorded two albums, this being his last. In 1995, Julio Bressane made a film called The Mandarin about the Brazilian popular music of the 20th century, focusing especially on the life and work of M√°rio Reis. The singer was played by actor Fernando Eiras.

It was the penultimate play he wrote. The play's action was loosely inspired by the true-life relationship between the actor Rex Harrison and his actress wife Kay Kendall. In the play, the couple are transformed into the egotistical left- wing literary critic Sebastian and his East European refugee wife Lydia. During the Second World War, some 30 years previously, Sebastian had served in military intelligence while the part-Jewish Lydia was with the Resistance and then survived on her wits and her feminine charms; each is shown using the aptitude for deception developed then to try to protect the other from the knowledge that Lydia is suffering from a terminal illness. Rounding out the cast are Mark, a best-selling popular novelist and a friend of Sebastian's, who has long carried a torch for Lydia, and Joey, the couple's 20-year-old son, himself an aspiring writer, who is in rebellion against his father's overbearing manner and professed Marxist views. The plays were described by Rattigan's biographer Michael Darlow in the following terms: Original productions The original London production, at the Duchess Theatre, was directed by John Dexter, and starred Donald Sinden as Sebastian and Joan Greenwood as Lydia. It ran for 131 performances, and was described by The Sunday Times critic as ‚Äúthe most piercing exposition of love under great stress that I have ever seen on the stage.‚Äù *Lydia Cruttwell - Joan Greenwood *Sebastian Cruttwell - Donald Sinden *Mark Walters - Don Fellows *Joey Cruttwell - Richard Warwick The subsequent New York production, directed by Fred Coe, which dropped the much-panned 2nd-act play Before Dawn, starred Rex Harrison in the role based on himself (Sebastian) and Julie Harris as Lydia. Rattigan was said to be \\"intensely disappointed and frustrated\\" by Harrison's performance, as \\"Harrison refused to play the outwardly boorish parts of the character and instead played him as charming throughout, signalling to the audience from the start that he knew the truth about Lydia's illness.\\" Critics however were quite pleased with the performance and, although it did not have a long run (199 performances), it was yet another of Harrison's well plotted naturalistic performances. *Lydia Cruttwell - Julie Harris *Sebastian Cruttwell - Rex Harrison *Mark Walters - Martin Gabel *Joey Cruttwell - Peter Burnell Adaptations & revivals In 1976, the play was filmed to great acclaim, with Alvin Rakoff directing for Anglia Television, and with Kenneth More and Claire Bloom in the lead roles. It was revived at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 2006 and at the Royal and Derngate Theatres, Northampton in 2011. It was broadcast as a Radio drama on BBC Radio 4 the same year. It has become a staple of repertory theatre seasons since.

In 1942 he was lecturer in geometry (he had studied algebraic geometry under the guidance of Federigo Enriques and other Roman mathematicians). After an interruption for military service and a long period of imprisonment, in 1948 Pompilj won the competition for the chair in geometry. He taught geometry and probability theory at the Faculty of Statistical Sciences, University of Rome. Probability theory became the main topic of his interests and he taught this discipline until his premature death. His research interests are attested by seventy publications and ten printed books, ranging across a broad spectrum of topics: algebraic geometry, the random sampling theory, the probabilistic analysis of experiments and especially the theory of random variables. This topic is certainly one of the most attractive for Pompilj because he found in it a fruitful field for the application of geometric concepts and because it could represent the unification of fields(not merely formal) of probability and statistics. Among the many initiatives taken to facilitate statistical studies in Italy, a special mention must go to \\"Courses of Statistical Methods for Researchers\\", which he organized in Rome in 1958. The lessons taught in these courses by a large number of distinguished professors were collected in several volumes, which still provides one of the most comprehensive presentations in this field.

The film deals with a young woman who gets bitten by a female vampire and drawn into her world. She falls in love with a young police officer who investigates a murder case involving the vampires. The film explores themes of depression, self-harm, the consequences of immortality, suicide, and explores Valerie Solanas' idea of an all-female society. Plot Lena, a young criminal, lurks near a cash dispenser. Just as her victim has used the machine, she pickpockets his credit card, but moments later her mark is arrested by the police. She flees, but a police officer, Tom, chases after her and eventually catches up with her on a bridge. After a short conversation, he tries to arrest her, but Lena hits him in the face, kicks him between the legs and jumps off the bridge onto a passing boat. Later that evening, Lena goes to a nightclub, which is run by Louise. Inside the club, Louise dances with Lena and offers her a drink. When Lena goes to the bathroom, Louise follows and bites her. The terrified Lena runs home. When she awakes in the morning, the sun burns her and she craves blood. Lena returns to the club to confront Louise about what has happened. She meets Louise's two companions, the stoic Charlotte and the cheerful Nora. On Charlotte's suggestion, the women sell Lena to some Russian pimps to force her to accept her new state of being (the word \\"vampire\\" is never mentioned in the film). Lena attacks one of the mobsters as he tries to rape her, but she is shot by another pimp wielding a shotgun. The women enter the compound and kills the pimps but fail to notice one mobster hiding in fear. Before leaving, Nora steals one of the mobster's Lamborghini. When Lena awakes at the hotel, Louise gives her a glass of what appears to be blood. As Lena drinks, she feels her strength return. Louise bathes Lena and tells her the story of how she was changed. At first she hated her maker, but grew to love her after traveling throughout Europe and getting to know all the benefits of the immortal life. After her maker was killed by sunlight, Louise wanted to commit suicide to join her, but instead began searching for a new companion. As Lena bathes, her short hair grows and returns to its natural color, her piercing falls out and she loses all bruises and wounds (including a tattoo on her belly). Lena spends a night shopping, partying and having fun with the women who give her the stolen Lamborghini. As the night comes to an end, the women return to their hotel to perform their morning ritual: allowing the first rays of sun burn their skin but retreating inside before any lasting harm can be done. Louise kisses Lena, which startles and confuses Lena who bites Louise's lip, before she interrupts herself and begins cursing her hastiness. The next night when Lena returns home to pick up some belongings, she is met by Tom, who used a file on Lena to find her home address. The two have coffee and talk, but when Lena suddenly sees Louise approaching, she uses her Lamborghini to retreat to the nightclub. She finds Charlotte in a private room where Charlotte tells Lena that she was a silent movie actress in the 1920s and that she had a husband and daughter. Louise enters the room and asks Lena why she is acting different. Lena lies that she misses the sun, so Louise takes the girls to Tropical Islands Resort that has artificial sunlight allowing them to have a pool party \\"in the sun\\". Two night watchmen find the girls and Nora convinces the men to join them in the pool. Lena is concerned they are going to harm them, but Louise gives Lena her word they will not hurt the men. However, Nora quickly kills off one of them, but the other tries to escape. Charlotte sadisticly kills this man and Lena flees the scene in terror. Tom and his partner, Lummer, interrogate the surviving mobster who says that the devil killed his friends and stole his Lamborghini. Tom realizes that the stolen car is the car he saw Lena drive. The SEK (German SWAT unit) storms the hotel and in the chaos, Nora dies when she is exposed to the sun. The three remaining women escapes and hide at the abandoned Teufelsberg and prepare to flee to Russia. Before leaving, Charlotte demands to see her elderly daughter, whom Charlotte sings a lullaby to as she dies. With a whole day before their departure to Russia the girls return to their hideout to perform their morning ritual. As the sun rises, Charlotte locks Lena and Louise inside and allows the sun to kill her. Lena goes to Tom to say goodbye and forces him to shoot her and the wound heals in front of his eyes to show her true nature. Lena begins to cry while Tom holds her and they fall asleep. Lummer, who has suspected Tom of having some involvement with the women since the hotel attack, has the SEK incarcerate them. Louise goes to the watchmen while they're in the shower and kills them. Louise ask Lena through an intercom how she would manage to live with a man destined to die, herself knowing the pain of losing a loved one. Louise kidnaps Tom and Lena follows her. At Teufelsberg, Louise wants Lena to tell her, \\"I love you\\". Lena does so and Louise says that that's the most beautiful lie she's ever heard and shoots Tom. Louise and Lena have a fight and Lena throws Louise into the sunlight, where she dies with a peaceful smile. Lena runs to Tom and wants to bite him, but stops, kisses him and begins to cry. At the end the SEK arrives with Lummer. Lena and Tom are gone with no trace other than Louise's gun. Lummer looks outside and whispers \\"Good luck\\" and walks away from the scene. Cast Background Director Dennis Gansel with star Max Riemelt Dennis Gansel originally wrote the script back in 1999. Then called The Dawn, the plot dealt with a love story between a Berlin vampire and a mortal. He pitched the movie to Nina Hoss, who became very enthusiastic and wanted to do the film right away. The script was in development hell for several years. First Franka Potente was going to direct, but with the flop of Creep, no one wanted to invest in German horror films. Gansel almost gave up hope until the release and success of Twilight sparked a wave of vampire films, and the success of Gansel's The Wave gave him free hands. Due to the similarities between the original script and Twilight, Gansel had Jan Berger rewrite the script, now under the title Wir sind die Nacht. Thinking that an ordinary love story was no longer in place with the boom of star crossed vampire/human relationships Gansel imagined a darker twist on the subject was more in order. He came up with a new, darker love story and took Carmilla as inspiration as he thought while Dracula had been done to death, no one had really made a serious attempt on Carmilla. Karoline Herfurth was shown the script back in 2000, but she was too young to play Lena, so Gansel promised her the role of Nora. But as production was delayed, Herfurth became old enough to play the part of Lena. Instead Anna Fischer was cast as Nora, who in the eye of producer Christian Becker was the perfect choice because she looked like a party girl. Jennifer Ulrich auditioned 4 times before being cast as Charlotte. Shooting began October 11, 2009 and ended on December 16. The setting of the club scene was an old bathhouse. The pool was unheated and therefore all the actors and extras had to play the scene in the cold. The exterior shots of the club came in a deserted theme park in the Berlin district of Treptow-K√∂penick, and Spree in the park. Due to the tight budget and not being able to afford too many shooting days, five cameras were rolling at the same time. The film was shot on 35 mm using Arriflex 235 and 435 cameras. Most of the stunts in the film were done by the actresses themselves. Wolfgang Hohlbein wrote a novel tie-in, which differs significantly from the final film. Soundtrack The film's score was composed by Heiko Maille and performed by the Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg. The soundtrack album, released as an MP3 download and on CD, features the majority of the songs and parts of the score. One song, \\"Pleased to meet you\\" by Wolfmother, was featured in the film, but is not on the soundtrack. Heiko Maile was inspired by the score of the film The Dark Knight and how it combined electronic music with orchestra music and electric guitar. Maile used \\"Au Clair De La Lune\\" as Charlotte's theme. Sven Hack performed the sad clarinet solos that appear throughout the film. # \\"Self-fulfilling Prophecy\\" ‚Äì Scala & Kolacny Brothers # \\"In Our Eyes\\" (Anthony Mills Soundtrack Version) ‚àí Moonbootica # \\"Wir sind die Nacht\\" ‚àí Covenant # \\"Charlotte's Death (Au Clair De La Lune)\\" (Score) ‚àí Heiko Maile # \\"Nightlife\\" ‚àí IAMX # \\"Lena's Metamorphosis\\" (Score) ‚àí Heiko Maile # \\"Cold Song\\" ‚àí Klaus Nomi # \\"Escape From The Hotel (Suite)\\" (Score) ‚àí Heiko Maile # \\"Dumpfe Tr√§ume (WSDN Remix)\\" ‚àí Xenia Beliayeva # \\"Miserable Girl (Nite Version)\\" ‚àí Soulwax # \\"Tief in der Nacht\\" ‚àí DJ Valero # \\"IERS\\" ‚àí Dirk Bl√ºmlein Terzett # \\"Land Of The Free\\" ‚àí Warren Suicide # \\"Farewell My Child\\" (score) ‚àí Heiko Maile # \\"Pretty When You Cry\\" ‚àí VAST # \\"Russian Whorehouse (Suite)\\" (score) ‚àí Heiko Maile # \\"Big And Bad (WSDN Edit)\\" ‚àí Gabriel Le Mar The complete score was released as an MP3 download on Amazon.de and the German iTunes Store. Alternative endings Two other endings were shot for this film, like with Gansel's previous film The Wave. Both were discarded to bring a more ambiguous ending to the film. The first alternative ending plays out almost like the final ending. It continues after Lena starts to cry and shows her running away into the subway station leaving Tom behind. She stops and looks behind her before starting to run again. In the second ending however, Lena finds Tom dying from his wound and bites him, turning him into a vampire. After delivering the bite, Lena flies backwards, crashing into the wall much like Louise did when she bit her. Lena whispers \\"Forgive me,\\" as Tom rises on his feet. The camera moves away as they look at each other. Critical reception German newspaper Die Welt praised the film and said it had rescued the vampire genre from the likes of Twilight, True Blood and The Vampire Diaries. The critic noted the film having a similar theme of Gansel's earlier films Die Welle and Before the Fall about the seduction of youth and also dealt with hedonism and obsession with youth. The critic praised the multiple levels and themes of the film and that Berlin was used as much more than a setting, almost a cipher. The critic also noted Gansel's decision to use female leads and felt he had a lot of empathy for them. The film was nominated for Best Editing and Best Film score at the 2011 German Film Awards. It was awarded the Special Jury Award at the 43rd Sitges Film Festival. About.com awarded the film with 4 stars and named it the best vampire film of the year. New York Times gave a negative review and called the film neither romantic or chilling. Twitchfilm.com praised the visuals and effects but was most enthusiastic about the lead characters. He compared that unlike films like Lesbian Vampire Killers, the film explored Louise's lesbian desire from a romantic and humanist perspective. The reviewer concluded by writing \\"There are no bad guys here, just misunderstood ones, so the way Lena concludes this is strange and unsettling. I really wanted to spend more time with this group, the film only touches upon what they have been through and feel, but regardless I highly recommend this.\\" Crave Online's reviewer wrote that \\"The vampires on display here are tragic creatures, certainly, but also fun-loving homicidal maniacs. The movie has action, gore and genuine drama to spare. It‚Äôs the best vampire movie since Let The Right One In, and if given the choice to watch either film over and over again I‚Äôd pick We Are The Night every time, because it‚Äôs fun as hell.\\" He went on to give the film the score 8.5/10. Hoollywood News gave the film four stars, commenting that the second part of the film was more satisfying than the first part, that the special effects where not spectacular but that was not needed due to the extremely strong script. The reviewer praised the acting as top-notch and stated the film was just as good as vampire classics like Near Dark and Let the Right One In. MoreHorror.com's Marcey Papandrea compared the film favourably to The Lost Boys and Near Dark and praised the acting of Herfurth, Hoss, Ulrich and Fischer, and noted that especially Nina Hoss was pitched perfect for the role. He noted that Max Riemelt was left with out much to do in the film with his character but thought he did what he could with his spare material. He concluded by stating \\"There isn't much to complain about here, it is a fun and interesting film, a breath of fresh air in an over done subgenre\\". One Metal named the film one of the best modern vampire films and gave it a 4/5 score, but commented that the pacing was uneven, especially in the climax. Like many other critics who reviewed the film, Fearnet commented that We Are the Night lacked in originality borrowing themes and elements from films like Near Dark and Interview with the Vampire but the execution of these themes and elements were extremely well done and the lack of originality was made up for by energy and execution. Fearnet ended up recommending the film but not praising it. Brutal as Hell made similar comments, but ended up being more positive stating the \\"borrowed\\" elements where already established tropes of vampire fiction. The reviewer praised the script and the acting and the well developed mythology of the vampire stating that the decade long work on the film showed of in well fleshed out characters and mythology. Trash City named it one of the 10 best films of 2011http://trashcity.org/content/tc‚Äôs-ten-best-films-of-2011/ (despite being a 2010 film). Jennifer Ulrich was given the award Best Interpretation New Talent at Horror Fantasy Awards. The film holds a 62% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Jennifer Ulrich was generally praised for her performance as Charlotte. The film was screened at MIX Copenhagen, a LGBT- film festival. Box office We Are the Night underperformed in German cinemas. Dennis Gansel stated in German press that the commercial failure \\"hurt his soul\\" because of all the work he and his co-workers put into the film. Gansel attributed the failure to the film opening the same week as The Twilight Saga: Eclipse and not able to compete with such an established franchise. The film fared better on DVD. Gansel has said he did not regret making the film and that it was \\"definitely worth making\\".

Hamish Hamilton, 1978) Cause C√©l√®bre or A Woman of Principle is a 1975 radio play, and the final play by the English author Terence Rattigan. It was inspired by the trial of Alma Rattenbury and her teenage lover in 1935 for the murder of her third husband Francis Rattenbury and first broadcast by the BBC on 27 October 1975. Alma was played by Diana Dors. Rattigan was then commissioned to rewrite it into a stage play ready to be produced in Autumn 1976, but his terminal cancer and casting problems meant he was only able to start work in January 1977, alongside director Robin Midgley. This stage version premiered at the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester in 1977 before its West End premiere on 4 July 1977 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, with Glynis Johns as Alma Rattenbury and Helen Lindsay as Edith Davenport. It received largely positive reviews. Rattigan checked himself out of hospital to attend the opening night. A 1987 television version of the stage play starred Helen Mirren as Alma. The stage play itself was revived at the Old Vic from March to June 2011 to mark Rattigan's centenary, directed by Thea Sharrock and with Alma played by Anne-Marie Duff and Edith Davenport by Niamh Cusack. Reviews were mainly very positive, with The Guardian calling it a \\"fine revival,\\" of a play which \\"stands the test of time.\\" Though the London Evening Standard regretted that \\"this is not Rattigan at his most eloquently anguished.\\" A new production of the radio play was aired by BBC Radio 4 on 25 June 2011, again directed by Sharrock, with original music by Adrian Johnston.

These entrepreneurs have gained access to shelf space in stores across the United States by participating in YouthTrade trade shows, where entrepreneurs meet one on one with buying teams from Whole Foods Markets to present their products. As of November 2013, the trade shows have led to YouthTrade entrepreneur's products being placed in the Mid-Atlantic, North Atlantic, Northeast, South, Southwest, Pacific Northwest, Northern California, and Southern Pacific regions of Whole Foods Markets. YouthTrade is partnered with Whole Foods Markets and Babson College, and operates out of Lexington, MA, and Wellesley, MA. In June 2013, Ahluwalia was given the 2013 India New England Woman of The Year Award, in recognition of her work towards ending youth unemployment. On October 19, 2013, Ahluwalia delivered the keynote address at the 7th Annual Forum for Social Entrepreneurship. In November 2013, she participated in the World Economic Forum's 2013 Summit on the Global Agenda in Abu Dhabi, serving on the Global Youth Unemployment Council. Ahluwalia lived in Lexington, MA with her husband and two children. She died on October 21, 2019 after suffering from cancer.

Early life Alexander Wolfe (born 24 December 1981) is a musician and songwriter. Born Alexander Gordon in Cambridge, he moved to Woolwich in South East London as a child. Upon leaving school Alexander formed his first band, 'Taxi', with Jamie Cullum, after a chance encounter in a guitar shop on London's Denmark St. The band enjoyed mild live success and toured with Paul Weller before finally imploding in the summer of 2002 due, partly, to Jamie's pending solo deal with Universal and partly due to musical differences. During this time Alexander's grandmother Betty died. He took her maiden name 'Wolfe' as his own and decided to pursue a solo career. Musical career Alexander released his debut album Morning Brings a Flood in March 2010, his second album Skeletons in September 2012, and his third From The Shallows in October 2014. Since its release in March 2010 Morning Brings a Flood has garnered significant critical acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic. The New York Post called it \\"the most beautiful album heard in years. Period\\" as well as four-star reviews in Q magazine and Uncut which described the album as, \\"An object lesson in how to wring out every last drop of emotion\\". The Sunday Times simply declared it, \\"A beautiful album\\". 'Song For the Dead' was used as the opening and closing music for BBC 2 sitcom Whites starring Alan Davies. The album was released on Dharma Records in March 2010. It was preceded by the double A-side single 'Till Your Ship Comes In/Teabags In Ashtrays' which was released in November 2009. 'Song for the Dead' was released as a single in May 2010. The Breakdown EP was released in July 2010. =Skeletons= Alexander's second album Skeletons is a mainly acoustic collection recorded in the house he grew up in Woolwich, South East London. The album was preceded by two singles, a dark reworking of the Neil Young song 'Don't Let It Bring You Down' in April 2012 and the title track of the album Skeletons in July 2012. =From The Shallows= His third album 'From The Shallows', was released in October 2014. 'From The Shallows' features 2 guest vocals from singer-songwriter Gabrielle Aplin, the first on album highlight 'Still Life', and also on the penultimate acoustic ode to lost love 'Love Is All There Is'. Hudson Taylor (musician) also add their vocals to album closer 'Set Your Shadow Free' The album was preceded 2 singles, 'Trick of the Light' which was released in August 2014, which received widespread regional & national radio play, and 'Sunburn', released in September 2014 which featured an accompanying fan made video featuring a guest cameo from Huey Morgan from Fun Lovin' Criminals, The video budget going to The Children's Trust. =Little Death= Alexander released his 4th solo album Little Death in 2019.

B-box zinc fingers can be divided into two groups, where types 1 and 2 B-box domains differ in their consensus sequence and in the spacing of the 7-8 zinc-binding residues. Several proteins contain both types 1 and 2 B-boxes, suggesting some level of cooperativity between these two domains. Occurrence B-box domains are found in over 1500 proteins from a variety of organisms. They are found in TRIM (tripartite motif) proteins that consist of an N-terminal RING finger (originally called an A-box), followed by 1-2 B-box domains and a coiled-coil domain (also called RBCC for Ring, B-box, Coiled-Coil). TRIM proteins contain a type 2 B-box domain, and may also contain a type 1 B-box. In proteins that do not contain RING or coiled-coil domains, the B-box domain is primarily type 2. Many type 2 B-box proteins are involved in ubiquitinylation. Proteins containing a B-box zinc finger domain include transcription factors, ribonucleoproteins and proto-oncoproteins; for example, MID1, MID2, TRIM9, TNL, TRIM36, TRIM63, TRIFIC, NCL1 and CONSTANS-like proteins. The microtubule- associated E3 ligase MID1 (EC) contains a type 1 B-box zinc finger domain. MID1 specifically binds Alpha-4, which in turn recruits the catalytic subunit of phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac). This complex is required for targeting of PP2Ac for proteasome-mediated degradation. The MID1 B-box coordinates two zinc ions and adopts a beta/beta/alpha cross-brace structure similar to that of ZZ, PHD, RING and FYVE zinc fingers. Homologs Prokaryotic homologs of the domain are present in several bacterial lineages and methanogenic archaea, and often show fusions to peptidase domains such as the rhomboid-like serine peptidase, and Zn-dependent metallopeptidase. Other versions typically contain transmembrane helices and might also show fusions to domains such as DNAJ, FHA, SH3, WD40 and tetratricopeptide repeats. Together these associations suggest a role for the prokaryotic homologs of the B-box zinc finger domain in proteolytic processing, folding or stability of membrane-associated proteins. The domain architectural syntax is remarkably similar to that seen in prokaryotic homologs of the AN1 zinc finger and LIM domains.

The BED finger is an about 50 to 60 amino acid residues domain that contains a characteristic motif with two highly conserved aromatic positions, as well as a shared pattern of cysteines and histidines that is predicted to form a zinc finger. As diverse BED fingers are able to bind DNA, it has been suggested that DNA-binding is the general function of this domain. Some proteins known to contain a BED domain include animal, plant and fungi AC1 and Hobo-like transposases; Caenorhabditis elegans Dpy-20 protein, a predicted cuticular gene transcriptional regulator; Drosophila BEAF (boundary element- associated factor), thought to be involved in chromatin insulation; Drosophila DREF, a transcriptional regulator for S-phase genes; and tobacco 3AF1 and tomato E4/E8-BP1, light- and ethylene-regulated DNA binding proteins that contain two BED fingers.

In 1947 the Pal√°cio Quitandinha was the site of the Rio Treaty, attended by United States President Harry Truman. History Designed by Italian architect Luis Fossatti, and constructed between 1941 and 1946 by the Brazilian entrepreneur Joaquim Rolla, the Pal√°cio Quitandinha is one of the most impressive architectural monuments in Petr√≥polis. The exterior is in the Norman-French style, while the interior is a mix of Brazilian Baroque and Art Deco. The surface area of the hotel is 50 thousand square meters. It has six floors, with a 10 meter high ground floor. It has 440 rooms plus 13 suites with decor by Dorothy Draper.Life (1947), Life magazine, p. 30, Time Inc, The hotel was, for many years, probably the second most famous hotel of the country, after the Copacabana Palace Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, which is only about 65 km from Petr√≥polis. The scenic artificial lake in front of the hotel, loosely resembling the shape of Brazil, was built to provide a source of water in the event of a fire. Interior of the restaurant. When it was opened as the \\"Cassino Hotel Quitandinha\\", the Pal√°cio Quitandinha was the largest hotel casino in Latin America. Gambling had been permitted in Brazil since 1930, but it was outlawed on May 30, 1946 by decree of the federal government under President Eurico Gaspar Dutra. The ruling outlawed all types of gambling from casinos to games of chance in Brazil. As a result, the casino closed after only two years. Notable guests who stayed at the hotel included Errol Flynn, Orson Welles, Lana Turner, Henry Fonda, Maurice Chevalier, Greta Garbo, Carmen Miranda, Walt Disney, Bing Crosby, politicians like Eva Per√≥n and President Get√∫lio Vargas of Brazil and King Carol II of Romania. The hotel eventually closed in 1962 and its rooms were sold as private residences in 1963. The imposing fa√ßade and the scenic surrounding of the hotel makes it an important tourist attraction itself. The building's enormous public areas were restored by Sesc, a Brazilian commerce organization which had taken them over, beginning in 2007.

There are two types of security assurance: positive and negative. A positive assurance states that the nation giving it will aid any or a particular non-nuclear-armed nation in retaliation if it is a victim of nuclear attack. A negative assurance is not the opposite but instead means that a nuclear-armed nation has promised not to use nuclear weapons except in retaliation for a nuclear attack against itself. See also No first use. Security assurances are a key part of nuclear diplomacy, and since they are statements of intent, not guarantees, they are based entirely on trust and the threat of retaliation should they be broken. Thus, Security Assurances have been issued and changed over time, and are vital tools in the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT). U.S. President Barack Obama modified the specific conditions of the US Negative Security Assurance on 6 April 2010 citing \\"the importance of nations meeting their NPT and nuclear non-proliferation obligations.\\" China is so far the only nation to issue a positive security assurance in April 1995, and at the same time, it issued a negative security assurance. China stated that despite its willingness to use nuclear weapons, it \\"[should] not in any way be construed as endorsing the use of nuclear weapons.\\" The dichotomy of such a position has led for calls to make more use of protocols attached to NWFZ (nuclear-weapon-free zone) treaties, instead of generalized security assurances.

It participates in the leagues and championships of the GAA's Mid Tipperary division, and in the county-wide competitions of Tipperary GAA. While several sports are played, hurling is predominant in the club. History Shortly after the foundation of the GAA in 1884, separate clubs were formed in Moyne and Templetuohy. Moyne's hurlers defeated Tullaroan (of Kilkenny) in Johnstown by 2-2 to nil in the club's first known match in 1887. Templetuohy played Gortnahoe on the same day. The clubs continued as separate entities for almost 50 years, with Templetuohy allying with Castleiney in the 1910s to play as 'Templetuohy and Castleiney United'. In 1936, however, a 'Moyne and Templetuohy' hurling club affiliated to Tipperary GAA along with a 'Templetuohy and Moyne' football club. In 1938, the local GAA secured ownership of the long-established Gaelic games grounds from the owners of the Longorchard estate. A new club, Moyne-St Albert's, had a brief existence in the parish in the 1950s. In 1991 the club began a new phase with the amalgamation of the separate hurling and football clubs in the parish. The present name was adopted, with Longorchard as the grounds. In 1999 a new clubhouse was opened, and a second pitch. The club is involved in Sc√≥r. Hurling In 1914 Templetuohy and Castleiney United won the Mid and County Championships. Moyne recorded their first championship success in the Mid Junior Hurling Championship of 1917. In 1918, they defeated Ileigh in the Intermediate final. In 1936 the newly-amalgamated Moyne and Templetuohy club lost the Mid Tipperary Senior Hurling final to Thurles Sarsfields. In the 1940s the club reached two Mid hurling finals. Moyne recorded its first senior championship defeat of then-dominant Thurles Sarsfields in the Mid semi-final of 1966. In 1970 Moyne-Templetuohy won the Mid-Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship for the first time. The club went on to win its only county Senior Hurling title to date in 1971, with a 2-8 to 0-6 victory over Roscrea. The club won the Mid Senior Hurling Championship in 1976 and 1977, and the county Intermediate Championship in 1983. =Honours= * Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship (1) **1971 * Tipperary Intermediate Hurling Championship (2) **1983, 2014 , * Mid Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship (4) ** 1970, 1972, 1976, 1977 * Mid Tipperary Intermediate Hurling Championship (5) ** 1982, 1983, 2001, 2002, 2004 ,2019 * Tipperary Junior A Hurling Championship (3) ** 1961, 1965, 1990 * Mid Tipperary Junior A Hurling Championship (7) ** 1917 (as Moyne), 1923 (as Templetuohy), 1930 (as Moyne), 1961, 1965, 2010, 2015 * Tipperary Junior B Hurling Championship (2) ** 2001, 2008 * Mid Tipperary Junior B Hurling Championship (2) ** 2001, 2008 * Mid Tipperary Under-21 A Hurling Championship (4) ** 1965, 1973, 1975, 1985 (as Moyne- Gortnahoe) * Tipperary Under-21 B Hurling Championship (2) ** 2011 (as Moyne- Templetuohy Og), 2013 (as Moyne-Templetuohy Og) * Mid Tipperary Under-21 B Hurling Championship (5) ** 2001, 2003, 2010, 2011 (as Moyne-Templetuohy Og), 2013 (as Moyne-Templetuohy Og) 2018, * Tipperary Minor A Hurling Championship (1) ** 1964 * Mid Tipperary Minor A Hurling Championship (3) ** 1964, 1965, 1966 * Tipperary Minor B Hurling Championship (2) ** 1987, 2009 (as Moyne- Templetuohy Og) * Mid Tipperary Minor B HurlingChampionship (2) ** 1987, 2009 (as Moyne-Templetuohy Og) 2017 (Moyne Templetuohy Gaels) * Mid Tipperary u21 B football 2019 =Notable players= *Paul Maher - All Ireland minor hurling winner 2012, All Ireland senior hurling Winner 2019 * Tom√°s Hamill All Ireland Senior Hurling Winner 2016 * Hugh Coghlan Tipperary Senior Footballer, 2006- * John Coghlan, Tipperary player at Minor, U-21 and Senior levels, 2007- * Tom Fogarty, Tipperary player (1960s-70s), later Tipperary and Offaly hurling manager * Elias O'Keeffe, the first Templetuohy player to join a Tipperary team when he was selected by county champions, Toomevara (1913) Gaelic football Templetuohy won the Mid Tipperary Senior Football Championship in 1911 and 1912, but lost the 1911 county championship final to Nenagh. An amalgamated Castleiney-Templetuohy team lost the 1915 final, again to Nenagh. In the 1940s the club contested four Mid Senior Football Championship finals. After winning the Mid in 1949, Templetuohy met Galtee Rovers in the county final. Although Galtee Rovers won the match, the title was awarded to Templetuohy due to irregularities with the Rovers team. In 1950, Templetuohy retained the Mid title. In 1980 Templetuohy won the Tipperary Junior Football Championship, defeating Arravale Rovers in the final. Promotion to the Intermediate ranks was immediately rewarded with a Championship title in 1981. The club next won the Mid Senior Championship in 1986 and 2001, defeating Loughmore-Castleiney on both occasions.
