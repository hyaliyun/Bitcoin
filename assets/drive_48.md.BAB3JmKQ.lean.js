Martin & Hall was the architectural partnership of Frank W. Martin (March 9, 1863 - February 2, 1917)Technology Review 1917: 299. and George F. Hall (1866-1928).Jordy, William H. and Christopher P. Monkhouse. Buildings on Paper: Rhode Island Architectural Drawings, 1825-1945. 1982. It was based in Providence, Rhode Island. History The firm was founded in February 1893 when the two men, who were both employed by Stone, Carpenter & Willson, decided to leave and open their own practice. They brought some clients with them, resulting in a rift with their former firm. Due to this, both were denied membership to the AIA until the deaths of Alfred Stone and Edmund R. Willson. The firm was dissolved upon Martin's death in 1917. It was continued as Hall's private practice, who ran the office until his death in 1928. Partner biographies Frank Howard Martin was born in Seekonk, Massachusetts in 1863, just across the state line. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, before leaving to work in New York City. He trained with several architects, including Richard Morris Hunt in 1886.American Architect and Building News 3 Sept. 1887: 115. In 1888 he opened his own office, but soon relocated to Providence to work for Stone, Carpenter & Willson, where he gained a high level of responsibility.Who's Who in New England. Ed. Alert Nelson Marquis. 1909. He and Hall left in early 1893, and established Martin & Hall of February 1, 1893. He remained a member of the firm until his death in 1917. George Frederic Hall was born in Providence in 1866. He went to work for Stone, Carpenter & Willson in the 1880s. His employers allowed Hall to take private commissions, including a building for the Narragansett Boat Club, of which he was a member, in 1891.Engineering Record 25 April 1891: 352. Along with Martin, he left in early 1893. After Martin's 1917 death, Hall continued in private practice. However, his prominence quickly declined, and he designed no significant buildings until 1927, when he was commissioned to design the William H. Hall Free Library in Cranston.Cranston, Rhode Island: Statewide Historical Preservation Report P-C-1. 1980. During that time he also served as the supervising architect on the Industrial Trust Building. He died in 1928.

Style Stylistically, Martin & Hall were very typical. They were very capable, but not very original. They favored the popular styles of the day: the Colonial and Gothic Revivals. When faced with a major civic commission, they would use an aggrandizing Beaux-Arts design. Their commercial buildings are among their most refined, the Shepard and Smith Buildings in particular. The Smith, especially, used a very sophisticated interpretation of the Chicago School, in the manner of Holabird & Roche. Other than this, the work of Martin & Hall trends toward wooden residences, usually Colonial Revival. Though plain and unremarkable, they add to the essence of the city.

Crazy Woman Crossing was one of three major fords used by travelers across creeks and rivers in this area. It is significant as the site of the Battle of Crazy Woman, a skirmish during Red Cloud's War in 1866. The United States pulled out of this territory after negotiation with the Lakota and allies of the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868. In the 1870s, the US attempted to claim some control of the Bozeman Trail, and the number of emigrants increased on this route. In 1878, August Trabing opened a store nearby to serve travelers on the trail, which came to be known as the Trabing Station. His was the first store in Johnson County. Crazy Woman Crossing became known as the place where what became known as Trabing Road crosses Crazy Woman Creek. Bozeman Trail In the spring 1863, John Bozeman and his associates scouted for a direct route from the goldfields at Virginia City, Montana to central Wyoming in order to connect with the Oregon Trail, which was then the major passage in the continental United States to the West Coast. The Bozeman Trail followed many north-south trails which the American Indians had used since prehistoric times to travel through Powder River country. On July 6, 1863, forty-six wagons, eighty-nine men and an unspecified number of women and children crossed the North Platte at Deer Creek (present-day Glenrock, Wyoming) and became the first wagon train to try the new trail. After travelers crossed the North Platte River, the first three major river crossings on the Bozeman Trail were Powder River Crossing, Crazy Woman Crossing, and Clear Creek Crossing (present-day Buffalo, Wyoming). At each water ford, travelers would often camp at least one night, to water their stock, review and renew supplies, and collect themselves. Between 1864 and 1868, the high risk of Lakota and allied attacks resulted in fewer than a thousand people using the Bozeman Trail. One Bozeman Trail emigrant was Ellen Fletcher. She recorded a series of diary and notes which described her experiences on trail during the summer of 1866. She wrote of the Crazy Woman Crossing: > Camped at \\"Crazy Woman's Fork.\\" It was a beautiful spot near the stream, in > a large grove of trees. The men built large campfires all around the wagons. > It was a pretty sight, the circular correll (corral) of white topped wagons > and tents scattered here and there, the blazing fires shining forth through > the trees, the busy men and women hurrying to and fro, and the quiet moon > looking down over it all. A large tree, bent over like an arch, crowns our > wagon. Crazy Woman Battle The Powder River Expedition (1865) and Red Cloud's War (1866) were United States military actions intended to suppress resistance by the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho in the region and protect travelers on the Bozeman Trail from attacks. On August 11, 1865, General Patrick Edward Connor's troops reached the Powder River Crossing, where they began building Fort Reno. After the Battle of the Tongue River on August 29, 1865, Connor was ordered to return to Salt Lake City. At about the same time, another group of soldiers under Colonel James Sawyer were ordered to build a military road for freighting supplies along the Bozeman Trail. In 1866, a military force under Colonel Henry B. Carrington was ordered to secure the route of the Bozeman Trail. Carrington established Fort Phil Kearny on July 14, initiating a military struggle by the Lakota and their allies in the area known as Red Cloud's War. The Lakota struggled to expel US forces. The Crazy Woman Crossing, a ford across Crazy Woman Creek, was one of the Indians' favorite spots for attack, as its terrain was amenable to ambush. On July 20, 1866, a group of thirty men and women settlers, led by Lieutenant A. H. Wand, left Fort Reno to travel to Fort Phil Kearny. Lieutenants Napoleon H. Daniels and George H. Templeton rode ahead to look for a suitable campsite at Crazy Woman Crossing. Unable to locate a suitable place, they turned back to join the larger group. Lieutenant Templeton described what happened next: \\"Lieut. (Daniels) remarked \\"look there\\" and spurred his horse up, going way ahead. I looked over my right shoulder but could see nothing, but upon looking over my left, I saw between 50 and 60 Indians mounted and in full chase about 150 yards in the rear. I spurred up old Pegasus, punched his (flank) with my gun and did everything to increase speed, but the horse seemed to me to be moving very slowly. After Mr. Daniels had gone 200 yards he was shot with an arrow through the back and fell off his horse, the saddle turning. I could do nothing to help him and did not expect to get away myself.\\" Templeton, hotly pursued, reached the wagon train, which formed a defensive corral on a bluff overlooking Crazy Woman Creek. The battle continued for several hours, until a cavalry patrol traveling from Fort Phil Kearny to Fort Reno, under Captain George Burroughs' command, relieved the beleaguered party. During the fight, a second soldier, Lance Corporal Terrence Callary, was killed near the corralled wagons. The Americans' total casualties were two killed and several wounded. Red Cloud's War was decisive with U.S. forces withdrawing. Two years later, the United States negotiated the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, ceding control of some territory to the Lakota and allies. This being the only treaty where the government accepted all terms offered by the Lakota and its allies. The army abandoned the Bozeman Trail, along with three forts in the Powder River country. Trabing Station As a result of the Great Sioux War of 1876, American armed forces reclaimed the Bozeman Trail and established a series of forts (Cantonment Reno, Fort McKinney, and Fort Custer). The Bozeman Trail was developed by the United States as a military road and telegraph route to serve these forts. Within a few years, several stage coach lines were established that hauled freight and passengers along the trail. In 1878, August Trabing established a trading post at the Crazy Woman Crossing. Trabing sold various goods including boots, hats, and liquor to local ranchers and travelers on the Bozeman Trail. In the fall of 1878, the store was robbed three times by a gang of about eight \\"road agents.\\" Because of these robberies, Trabing moved his store in 1879 from the Crazy Woman Crossing to the Clear Creek Crossing (present day Buffalo, Wyoming). After Trabing left Crazy Woman Crossing, his building was used as a post office for ranchers and stockmen, and a stage station for the stagecoach lines. Local people described the Trabing building as a long, log structure paralleling the road, with three rooms. At the south end of the building were two small log outbuildings, one a schoolhouse, the other a blacksmith shop. To the east was another large log building served as the stable, with several corrals for livestock. According to Post Office records, Trabing City was established as a post office on January 20, 1879, with Abraham M. Baumann as postmaster. The post office was renamed Trabing and Andrew King was named as postmaster on August 26, 1880. The Trabing post office closed on December 13, 1913, and mail service was moved to Buffalo.

Waiting on the others to catch up, he had breakfast with wine. Once the others were in sight the fleet proceeded to Pevensey in Sussex.

R. Allen Brown (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 1988), p. 172 She might have been named for the Morini, ancient inhabitants of Flanders, as a reference to Matilda's Flemish origins. The Latin word mora has several meanings, none of which seem likely. These range from 'delay' or 'pause' to 'foolish' or 'foolish woman'. Also is the possibility that Mora was an anagram of Amor.

Barbour's General Store is a museum and tourist hub in Saint John, New Brunswick. It is an authentic 19th-century general store building, preserved and used to recreate a Victorian-era educational experience for visitors. It is located at the intersection of King Street and Prince William Street in the Trinity Royal Historic Preservation Area in the city's uptown. On August 22, 2015 the shop was re-opened to the public as a functioning business and local information centre.Blackford, Ashley. \\"Saint John business bringing back Barbour's General Store\\", CTV Atlantic, Canada, 3 August 2015. History The museum was founded in 1967. The store itself was originally built in the mid-1800s, in northern New Brunswick. It operated as a general store from the 1860s to the 1940s. The building was relocated to Saint John in the late 1960s, and was towed down the Saint John River. The preservation of the building, and the recreation of the general store with historic artifacts, was funded by the G.E. Barbour Company, for which it is now named. The idea for the museum came to local businessman Ralph Brenan, who worked for G.E. Barbour. He was dismayed to discover that his granddaughter did not know what coal was, or many other common items from his own childhood. He sought to remedy the lack of awareness of local history for his granddaughter and other children of the area by establishing a museum in the centre of Saint John. Features The general store is recreated with historic artifacts that would have been seen on the shelves of a local shop of the era. Goods such as clothing, shoes, hats, preserved tobacco, medicines, household items such as tools, lamps, boardgames and irons are on display, as well as local items such as Surprise Soap, made in the nearby town of St. Stephen, and Crosby's molasses, made in Saint John.

Established in the 1980s by Fr John Neudegger, OSB, the monastery is currently home to 24 monks. Fr Prior Edward Etengu is the community's superior. History=Early Years= Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Uganda was embroiled in civil war. Hostilities forced the withdrawal of many Christian missionaries from the country. A number of Benedictine sisters found themselves in need of spiritual direction, and requested that Abbot Lambert D√∂rr of Peramiho Abbey send one of his Missionary Benedictine monks to assist their community. In 1980, Abbot Lambert assigned a Benedictine priest, then residing at Nairobi dependency of Peramiho, to Uganda to minister to the sisters. Fr John Neudegger arrived in Tororo in 1981. Though much of his time was occupied with the spiritual direction of the Benedictine sisters, he also had the opportunity to recruit local vocations for the Nairobi monastery from which he had come. Indeed, monastic vocations proved to be more fruitful in Uganda than back in Kenya. This led to the foundation of a house in Uganda for the training of indigenous monastic vocations. Neudegger purchased some property on the outskirts of Tororo, and built a few simple brick buildings. This first foundation was placed under the Council of the Ottilien Congregation. Fr Aelred Cousins, a Benedictine of Belmont Abbey, joined Neudegger in 1983, aiding in the spiritual formation of the candidates. At the Congregation's General Chapter in 1984, the Tororo project was accepted as a pre-foundation under the sponsorship of the Council of the Congregation. Neudegger's monastery was given four years to prove that the Benedictine life could survive in Uganda. Like the monastic community of Agbang, the venture was seen as an attempt to use local resources and skills to build a truly African monastic community. In 1988, when the next General Chapter met, the delegates were satisfied with the profess of the Tororo monastery. The community was allowed to open a canonical novitiate, in which vocations would be trained according to the principles of the Missionary Benedictines. To aid this, monks of the Congregation would be sent to the foundation to help in the physical and spiritual development of the monastery. =Later Development= Despite its initial promise, the community of Tororo had to deal with the ongoing internecine violence in Uganda. On August 25, 1990, one of the brothers was brutally murdered. The monks of Tororo are employed in engineering, automotive maintenance, and carpentry. A fine art studio on the monastery premises promotes locally inspired art. The monks also provide necessary services to the local population, repairing eyeglasses and running a dispensary. An agricultural school and a kindergarten are attached to the monastery. On November 21, 1993, the monastic foundation at Tororo was raised to the status of a simple priory. The monastery remains under the direct control of the Council of the Congregation. Dependencies At this time, Christ the King Priory has no dependent houses. Personnel As of May 18, 2011, 13 solemnly professed monks (six of them priests) resided at Tororo. At this time, the community also included seven temporally professed monks, four novices, and three postulants. Fr Prior Edward Etengu is the current superior of the monastic community. He was appointed prior on March 29, 2006.

The complex was used for the storing of materials used for the royal palaces but also has a long history as home and work place for sculptors associated with the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. Together with the adjacent F√¶stningens Materialg√•rd, its military counterpart, and the Royal Horse Guards Barracks, it forms a cluster of low, yellow-washed buildings alongside Frederiksholm Canal. It now houses the Art Academy's School of Sculptury as well as residences. History The ring riding columns at Rosenborg Castle Gardens, stored at Civiletatens Materilag√•rd 1823-27 The long main building facing the canal was originally designed by Jacob Fortling. shortly before his death in 1761, and subsequently completed by court architect Georg David Anthon, roughly to that design, in 1771. The complex was used for the storing of materials and building parts and furnishings for the royal palaces and other buildings. The ring riding columns and marble balls in Rosenborg Castle Gardens are examples of artifacts at some point stored at Civiletatens Materialg√•rd. Johannes Wiedeweldt, the first sculptor to live and work at Civiltatens Materialg√•rd From its earliest day, the complex also provided accommodation and studio facilities for sculptors at the Royal Art Academy. Most of the profession's work at that time consisted of producing artworks and other decorative features for royal construction projects. Johannes Wiedewelt lived there from its completion in 1771 until 1802 and as did his two sisters and a nephew. Wiedewelt also maintained a studio in the building where he created Frederick V's tomb for Roskilde Cathedral among other works. Hermann Ernst Freund painted in 1835, while he lived at Materialg√•rden, by his friend Christian Albrecht Jensen The residence was then taken over by Nicolai Dajon, from 1818 until 1821 director of the Art Academy, who lived there until his death in 1823. His works executed in the building included his two statues \\"Bravery\\" and \\"Civic Virtue\\" for the Liberty Column (Frihedsst√∏tten) at the site as well as Tordenskjold's tomb for Church of Holmen. After Dajon's death, it would last five years before another artist, Hermann Ernst Freund, was given residency at Materialg√•rden. He had just returned to Copenhagen after nine years in Rome, where he had worked for Bertel Thorvaldsen, and assisted by Georg Hilker and Constantin Hansen he decorated his new home, both interiors and furnishings, in Pompeian Styles. It attracted widespread attention with the city's establishment and led to many commissions for decorations of private homes in the time that followed. Vilhelm Bissen's studio in 1893 Herman Wilhelm Bissen also maintained a studio in the building, first in the north wing and after Freund's death in 1840 in the south wing. His practically lived at the studio, where he kept a tangle of plants and animals, including lizards, and did most of his works, including the Isted Lion, his Landsoldaten in Fredericia and the equestrian statue of Frederick VII in front of Christiansborg Palace. Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen at work in her studio After Bissen's death, the premises were taken over by his son Vilhelm Bissen. He continued to work at Materialg√•rden but gave up the residence after a few years to move to an apartment in Vester Voldgade. Jens Adolf Jerichau also worked at Materialg√•rden before moving to Charlottenborg. After Vilhelm Bissen's death in 1913, the sculptor Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen moved in, together with her husband, the composer Carl Nielsen. They lived in the south wing. The couple separated in 1919 but reunited in 1922 and continued to live at Civiletatens Materialg√•rd until 1931. Back in 1908, Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen had been commissioned to create the equestrian statue of King Christian IX for Christiansborg's riding grounds on the opposite side of the canal. and she would continue to work on the project for most of the years she lived at Frederiksholm Canal, not completing it until 1927. Architecture The main building along the canal is 21 bays long and has a large hipped roof of red tiles. In the middle there is a two windows high gable fronted wall dormer above an entrance gate. Various other buildings are located to the rear of the main wing, forming several courtyard spaces. Immediately to the left of the main building, also facing the canal, is a diminutive half-timbered house of only three bays. It served as residence for the stable boy (foderdrengen).

Built in 1903, it is owned and operated by New Jersey Transit Rail Operations (NJT). The swing bridge is situated between the Lyndhurst and Delawanna stations of NJT's Main Line, from its origination point at Hoboken Terminal, and from the river's mouth at Newark Bay. Norfolk Southern Railway uses the bridge to access Croxton Yard to the east across the New Jersey Meadowlands. The bridge is required by federal regulations to open on 24-hour notice. It is listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places (ID#2950). The lower of the long Passaic River downstream of the Dundee Dam is tidally influenced and navigable. Rail service across the river was originally oriented to bringing passengers and freight from the points west over the Hackensack Meadows to Bergen Hill, where tunnels and cuts provided access terminals on the Hudson River. The crossing of the river was developed under the auspices of the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad (DL&W;) as part of its Boonton Branch, which in 1960 merged with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie-Lackawanna. In 1963, the Erie's Main Line south of Paterson through downtown Passaic was abandoned and service was shifted to the alignment over the Lyndhurst Draw and the Upper Hack Lift. Operations were later taken over by Conrail under contract with the New Jersey Department of Transportation and in 1983 by NJT.

The colliery was one of the seven areas of deep gales - founded after the Dean Forest (Mines) Act in 1904. The colliery exploited six seams containing of coal which could give a working life of around 200 years (at an extraction rate of per annum. The principal coal seam was the Coleford High Delf, a steam coal much in demand and said to be up to thick. Demand led to discussions with the Great Western Railway over the provision of a link to its network. History The first gale was granted on 19 March 1906 to Mr. J. R. Brown. Henry Crawshay & Company was offered the gale in October 1907 and completed the purchase on 24 December 1907. The purchase took place because the company was aware that the coal reserves at its Lightmoor Colliery would not last ten years, let alone the predicted twenty. Construction of the railway connection began in 1908 along with the sidings but the facilities were basic, having a two-lever ground frame allowing access to the complex. A signal box at Eastern United was not provided until late 1913. In early 1914 it was announced that Eastern was not the success everyone hoped as the western portion of the gale could not be exploited because of its geological condition. By 1916 its fortunes had changed, the coal seam had levelled out. By April 1919 output was up to per day. Accounts showed that the colliery was running at a loss until 1923, except for a small profit made in 1919. Expenditure at Eastern was made to modernise the facilities (including the repair and replacement of the boilers, the fitting of electricity and pumping equipment) and the provision of railway vehicles. In 1914 twenty wagons were purchased from the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (at a cost of ¬£16 5s 6d per wagon) to complement thirty others. The older wagons had been rented and subsequently purchased (at a cost of ¬£8 16s per wagon) from the Ince Waggon & Ironworks Co. of Wigan, through their broker - the Lincoln Wagon Co. of Doncaster. The colliery was nationalized in 1947 and became part of the National Coal Board South Western Division. It closed on 30 January 1959.

In 2017, the diocese embarked in a year of reconsecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, patroness of the diocese. This was accompanied by the formation of an 18-person ad hoc task force to ascertain the present pastoral needs of the diocese. A survey was also shared with all priests and with all diocesan households. In May 2018, the Diocese faced financial scandal when it became apparent that since 2004 the financial department had been mis-allocating funds from employee paychecks. Bishop Monforton embarked on a forensic audit of the diocesan finances dating back to 2014. The diocese paid 3.5 million in back taxes, causing cuts to certain diocesan offices. Following the austerity measures, the diocese balanced its financial standing following the diocesan financial irregularities. His Vicar General, Msgr. Kurt Kemo resigned.

He was crowned Zambian player of the year in 1977 at the age of 20, the first goalkeeper to achieve that feat, and was in goal for Zambia at CAN 1978. He is currently coaching Zambian Division 2 side Young Green Eagles. Early life Chileshe was born in Mporokoso in 1957 and was among three goalkeepers in the family. His elder brother Richard played for Bancroft Blades (now called Konkola Blades) in the late 1960s while his younger brother Stephen was a reserve goalkeeper at Nchanga Rangers in the 1980s when Chileshe kept goal for the main team. Besides playing for his school Ndelela Primary, Chileshe joined Kalala Amateur Football Club in 1969 at the age of twelve. He was inspired to become a goalkeeper by Mufulira Wanderers goalkeeper Tolomeo \\"Juva\\" Mwansa and while listening to football commentaries, Chileshe would tell his friends that he also wanted to be a national team goalkeeper and to be heard on radio. Playing career Kalala also served as a nursery for the Luanshya All Blacks Football Club which he joined three years later as a reserve goalkeeper. He became a regular in 1975 by which time Roan United had developed interest in him. He crossed over to Roan but it was not easy to win a regular place because national team goalkeeper Emmanuel Mwape was their number one choice and the reserve goalkeeper was Simon Chande who was equally good. In 1976, Chande left Roan for Kitwe side Rokana United but after a short while, shifted camp to Kabwe Warriors. Because of this, Rokana lured Mwape to Kitwe which opened the door for Chileshe at Roan. Another break for Chileshe was the choice of Luanshya's TVT College as a camping venue for the national team and being the nearest club, Roan would be invited for practice matches leading to him being noticed by national team coaches. Before the end of the year, Chileshe who was also captain of the Zambia Schools team, was called to the national team. He made his international debut on 26 March 1977 at the age of 19 in a friendly against Malawi which Zambia won 8‚Äì1 and he did enough to convince fans that a talented goalkeeper had arrived on the scene. Nicknamed \\"The Black Cat\\" he won the Zambian FA cup when Roan beat Mufulira Wanderers 3 ‚Äì 2 in a thrilling final played at Independence Stadium and was in Zambia's team at the CECAFA tournament later that year. At the end of the season, Chileshe was the surprise choice for the footballer of the year award by the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ). Amid a lot of public discontent because fans felt the player was too raw and unknown to merit the top award, and that Godfrey Chitalu should have been the winner as he had done more on the pitch than any other player, and without him, Zambia would not have qualified to the 1978 CAN tournament. Chileshe was however backed by national team captain Ackim Musenge who said he deserved the award, rather than picking on old timers all the time. Chileshe himself said he did not expect the award but he was pleased that he had won it. \\"Like all the other players, I was rather surprised at my selection. We all thought one of the old guard would be given the award.\\"Mijoni, Violet \\"Chileshe was right choice, insist FAZ\\" Times of Zambia, 8 February 1978, p.8 The young goalkeeper was in goal at CAN 1978 in Ghana where Zambia were eliminated after a defeat, a win and a draw against the hosts, Upper Volta and Nigeria respectively. In September 1979, Chileshe surprised many fans when he featured as a centre-forward in a league match against Rokana United at Kafubu Stadium. Not only did he create the first goal scored by Zambani Sailota, he scored the second in a 3‚Äì0 win. Ironically, he scored past his predecessor Emmanuel Mwape. Unlike other Zambian goalkeepers who started out as strikers and later played as forwards after establishing themselves in goal, he had always been known to be a goalkeeper.Anon. \\"Chileshe goal saves Roan\\" Times of Zambia, 16 September 1979, p.10 In 1981, Chileshe was loaned to league champions Nchanga Rangers to help them in their quest to win the African Club Champions Cup but disaster struck when Chileshe broke his right leg in the 85th minute of a league match against Mufulira Wanderers in April 1981 when he collided with Ashols Melu. Several Rangers players were in tears as their goalkeeper was carried off to the hospitalAnon. \\"Muf horror,\\" Times of Zambia, 30 April 1981, p.8 Chileshe was ruled out for the rest of the season and this proved to be a blow to Rangers' continental cup aspirations as they were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Vita Club of Zaire 4‚Äì3 on aggregate in September. When he recovered, Chileshe made the move to Rangers permanent but moved to Division I side Zesco United in 1984, helping them to a runners-up slot in the BP Challenge Cup, when they lost 2‚Äì0 to Mufulira Wanderers. Despite being on the losing side, Chileshe was voted man of the match after pulling off a string of brilliant saves. He was then recalled to the national team and was one of the reserve goalkeepers when Zambia emerged victorious at CECAFA 1984 and he described it as a very emotional moment because he had participated in 4 previous tournaments and they had always failed to finish first. He retired from international football soon after that, his last appearance for Zambia coming on 2 February 1985 in a friendly against Zimbabwe in Gweru. Coaching career In 1986, Chileshe was appointed player-coach at Zesco and won them the 1986 Division I title and promotion to the premier league and also led them to another BP Challenge Cup runners-up slot when they lost to Division I side Zanaco in 1987. In 1990, Chileshe decided to go to Swaziland where he coached various teams in a period of 5 years: Police Leopards, Manzini Wanderers and Mbabane Swallows. In 1996, he joined Botswana Police IX as coach for a year before heading back home. On his return in 1997, he was appointed coach for Division I Nakambala Leopards and led them to 4th position on the log. However, the team was caught up in sponsorship problems and he left to coach another Division I team TAP Dragons from 1998‚Äì2000 when he became coach for City of Lusaka. Chileshe gave up the City job after being offered the goalkeeping coach's job for the Swaziland national team where he worked with Dodge Mahlahlela and Kinnah Phiri. Chileshe was in Swaziland until 2002 when his contract expired and is currently coaching FAZ Division II side Young Green Eagles in Kafue. References Anon.

The Museum was opened by founder Marcia Koven in 1986. A Jewish Historical Society had already been established in the congregation. Overview The Museum is based on a community history model. It is supported through artifact donations and other participation by members of the local Jewish community. The Jewish community in Saint John has roots going back to the mid-1800s. Solomon Hart, a businessman from England, became the founder of the existing Jewish community in the city when he immigrated to Saint John in 1858. The first synagogue in the city was established by Solomon and Sarah Hart in 1889. Immigration from northern and eastern Europe increased the community to about 1400 members in the 1920s. Immigration to Saint John waned after this, and as out-migration to larger cities increased, the city's Jewish population declined to about 300 members in the 1960s. Today there are roughly two dozen Jewish families in the congregation. The Museum has several permanent exhibits, as well as new exhibits each year, and occasional travelling exhibits. Outreach programs include hosting tours from local schools, distribution of educational kits, and hosting tours from cruise ships visiting the city. The Museum also has a library and archive of Jewish history, viewed by appointment.

Renowned for his exceptional defensive ability and versatility, Musenge is rated as one of the finest defenders to have played for the Zambia national team, which he captained at the 1978 African Cup of Nations in Ghana. He later coached Mufulira Wanderers and several other club sides. Early life Musenge was born on 7 October 1949 in Mufulira. His father Diamond Musenge was a carpenter while his mother Eness was a house-wife. He was the first born in a family of seven of which four were boys. His brother Japhen also played for Wanderers. He attended Mufulira Mine School and later Kantanshi Secondary School.Tembo, Benedict \\"Ackim Musenge: Hero of 1974!‚Äù Zambia Daily Mail, Stars of Yester-year, 4 June 2011, p.10 Playing career= Butondo Western Tigers= At the age of 15 Musenge joined Zambian Division II side Butondo Western Tigers, one of the teams sponsored by Mufulira Division of Roan Copper Mines. He later formed part of the first Zambia School‚Äôs national team which was coached by John Green and managed by King George High School teacher Glyn Peters. During his time with Zambia Schools, Musenge played in high-profile friendly matches against English youth teams such as West Ham United, Ipswich Town and Derby County youth teams. At Tigers, Musenge who started off as an attacking midfielder and occasionally played on the right wing, was a regular goal scorer. In 1966, he helped the team gain promotion to Division I and went on to become captain. In 1969, he scored 18 goals in all competitions. In the early '70s, Samuel \\"Zoom\\" Ndhlovu, who was Wanderers' coach but would also double as Tigers coach from time to time since they shared the same sponsor, noticed some defensive qualities in Musenge's play and converted him into a defender to shore up a leaky defence. In April 1975, Musenge was transferred to Wanderers along with Brines Mulenga and Gerald Mungule. This was a controversial move in that Tigers alleged that they were being victimised by mine management who ordered them to surrender the three players to Wanderers who in turn gave Tigers three reserve players. Tigers officials protested to the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) to no avail, and labelled mine management \\"pro-Wanderers.\\"Anon. \\"Butondo protest to FAZ over 'exchange'\\" Times of Zambia, 17 April 1975, p.10 Many have pointed to this forced transfer of Tigers' best players as what led to the decline in the team's fortunes. =Mufulira Wanderers= His transition to Wanderers was seamless as Musenge held his own in a very successful team which had a bevy of stars. He made his debut on 20 April 1975 in a league match at Shinde Stadium against Ndola United which Wanderers won 2‚Äì0.Wasa, Mike \\"New-look Mighty Wanderers thrash Ndola\\" Times of Zambia, 21 April 1975, p.10 His versatility was such that he could play right across the backline and that made him very popular with fans. He settled in the centre-back position and was a good reader of the game, unbeatable in the air and always calm. His first piece silverware was the 1975 Independence Cup when Wanderers beat Green Buffaloes 2‚Äì1. In December of that same year, confusion reigned when Buffaloes registered 'Ackim Musenge' for the following years' East and Central African Club championship and Wanderers were up in arms, accusing Buffaloes of poaching their player. It turned out that the player registered by Buffaloes was an 18-year-old cousin of the Wanderers star, who coincidentally shared the same name with him.Anon. \\"Buffaloes speak out over 'poach' allegations.\\" Times of Zambia, 9 December 1975, p.10 Musenge won two league titles in 1976 and 1978 and was runner-up in 1975 and 1977 both times to Green Buffaloes. He also won the Heroes & Unity Cup in 1976, 2 Charity Shields in 1976 and 1977 and was a three-time winner of the Champion of Champions trophy in 1976, 1977 and 1978. One of the most disciplined players around, Musenge was appointed Wanderers captain in 1977, the same year in which he was named captain of the national team. In 1979, Musenge suffered a broken leg at that years' CECAFA tournament in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Tanzania, which would keep him out of action for more than a season. He attempted a comeback in 1981 but a nagging knee injury forced him to quit for good after being operated on. National team Musenge was first called to the national team by John Green as a 19-year-old in 1968 and made his debut when Zambia played a friendly match against Tanzania on 24 October 1968, in preparation for a World Cup qualifier against Sudan. Due to the superb pairing of Dickson Makwaza and Dick Chama at the heart of Zambia's defence, Musenge would spend some time as a squad player without seeing much action. In a CAN 1972 qualifier in Kinshasa in June 1971 which Zambia lost 3‚Äì0, Musenge replaced midfielder Richard Stephenson as a second-half substitute and when he did cement a regular spot in the team, it was as a left-back. He was in the team that beat Morocco 4‚Äì0 in October 1973 in a World Cup qualifier and was also in the Zambian team that defeated Nigeria 7‚Äì4 in aggregate after a 5‚Äì1 first leg victory in Lusaka, to qualify to CAN 1974. He featured at the tournament in March 1974 where Zambia reached the final only to lose to Zaire after a replay. After the retirement of first Makwaza and then Chama in the mid-'70s, Musenge assumed the central defence position and was named captain in January 1977. He led Zambia to the CAN 1978 where they were ejected in the first round. Musenge fractured his leg in November 1979 at that years' CECAFA tournament and this ended his national team career. After a long lay-off, he attempted a comeback in October 1981 but a knee injury, which required an operation brought down the curtain on his playing career. Coaching career Musenge began coaching at a young age. He was player-coach during his time at Butondo as they did not have a coach so the players trained themselves and used the expertise of Ndhlovu from time to time. After his career-ending injury, Musenge returned to Butondo as a coach and was then appointed Wanderers assistant coach to Ndhlovu in 1983. He also coached the Zambia U-16 team in 1984 which featured a young Charles Musonda. The team fell by the wayside one match short of the World Youth Cup finals in China. Musenge attended a coaching course in East Germany in 1985 and when Ndhlovu was promoted to oversee all mine-sponsored football teams, Musenge became Wanderers head coach, winning the Heroes & Unity Cup and the Champion of Champions Cup in his first season. In 1991, Musenge was appointed assistant national team coach to Ndhlovu, along with Freddie Mwila, Emmanuel Musakabantu and George Mungwa for the regional CECAFA tournament in Sudan which Zambia won after beating Kenya 2‚Äì0 in the final, despite not fielding any of their big name players. He was also part of the technical bench at CAN 1992 where Zambia lost in the quarter-finals to eventual winners Ivory Coast. The coaching team was dropped and a disillusioned Musenge packed his bags and headed for Botswana where he coached Nico United in Selebi Phikwe.Anon. \\"Musenge ditches Mighty\\" Times of Zambia, 15 April 1992, p.10 He found other Zambian coaches there like Dick Chama at BDF and Freddie Mwila at Township Rollers. The Zambian coaches made such an impact there that the trio were included in the BFA technical committee. Musenge won the Independence Cup in his first season at Nico United and stayed with the team for 6 seasons with their best showing in the league being a second-place finish. He then moved to TAFIC of Francistown in 1998 and won the President's Cup in his first season. Two years later he moved to Army side Continental Aces and after two years, moved to Boteti Young Fighters of Orapa in 2003. The following year, he returned to TAFIC and after 13 years in Botswana decided to return to Zambia. He joined Zambia National Service-sponsored Young Green Eagles in Kafue and helped the team win promotion to Division I. In appreciation of this, the ZNS command transferred him to Green Eagles in Kabwe where he worked with coach Jim Mwale in guiding the team to the Super Division. After four years, Musenge parted company with Eagles in 2011 and retired to his farm in Nyimba. Personal life Musenge is married to Christine and they have three children; Hector, Wendy and Diana.

During the American Civil War Storey pursued a \\"Copperhead\\" political line of vehement opposition to Abraham Lincoln and the Union war effort. Biography=Early years= Wilbur Fisk Storey was born December 19, 1819, in Salisbury, Vermont. He spent his childhood years on his father's farm, attending local common-schools during the winter months.\\"His Career at an End: Death of Wilbur F Storey, Editor and Owner of the Chicago Times,\\" Canton [SD] Advocate, vol. 9, no. 30 (Nov. 6, 1884), p. 2, reprinting material from the Chicago Daily News. The family subsequently moved to Middlebury, Vermont, where Storey was apprenticed to a printer at the age of 12. He worked in the office of the Middlebury True Press until the age of 17, when he gathered his meager savings and relocated to New York City to work as a compositor for the Journal of Commerce. In 1838, Storey moved West to La Porte, Indiana to launch a newspaper of his own, a Democratic paper edited by future United States Senator Edward A. Hannegan. The publishing venture never attained profitability, however, and Storey went into commerce as the proprietor of a local drug store. Growing tired of Indiana, Storey moved next to Jackson, Michigan, where he studied law for two years. He established there the Jackson Patriot, another paper lending its allegiance to the Democratic Party. He was appointed postmaster for Jackson under James K. Polk's administration as a reward for his support, whereupon he sold the paper. In 1849, new Whig President Zachary Taylor exercised his power of political patronage and removed the Democrat Storey from the postmaster position. Out of work, Storey launched another drug store. He was chosen the year following a member of the Michigan constitutional convention, and was subsequently appointed state prison inspector. =Detroit Free Press= In 1853 he moved to Detroit, where he obtained a minority ownership share in the struggling Free Press. He subsequently bought out his partners, first purchasing a 50% stake in the publication before becoming sole owner and publisher. Over the next eight years the paper grew in size and influence, becoming one of the largest Democratic papers in the West and enabling Storey to accumulate a financial nest-egg of $30,000. =Chicago Times= He went to Chicago in 1861 and purchased the Times, which then had a very small circulation. He redid the typography, sensationalized the presentation, and added local news. This source gives 18 December as his date of birth. His energy, enterprise, and fearless expression of his views on every subject gave the paper notoriety. He was independent in an extreme way, boasting that he had no friends and wanted none, and apparently doing his utmost to create enemies. His whole mind was bent on giving the news, though his idea of what constituted news frequently struck some as morbid and indecorous. His efforts yielded him a large fortune. Storey had supported Stephen A. Douglas in the 1860 presidential election. While opposing secession, the Times became a vehement critic of Abraham Lincoln after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. General Ambrose Burnside shut it down in 1863 for two days, but loyalists complained about the suppression of freedom of the press, and Lincoln quickly lifted the ban on the paper's publication. The paper's plant was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, but after publishing out of improvised facilities for two years, it began publishing from a new facility in 1873. It established a London bureau in 1877 to get news on the Russo- Turkish War of 1877-1878. Storey was a manager, and generally left the writing to others. =Death and legacy= About 1877 his health began to fail, and he went abroad. In the summer of 1878 he had a paralytic stroke, and was brought home. Storey seems to have suffered from dementia in the aftermath, and in 1884 a conservator of his estate was appointed by the courts. Storey died at his home in Chicago on October 27, 1884. The editorialist of the Republican Mattoon Gazette colorfully memorialized the passing of the publisher of his paper's political rival: > \\"Having lived the life of an Ishmaelite [outcast], ...there are almost none > who mourn at his death; yet it is a fact he has left a mark upon the > journalism of the country as deep as any newspaper manager in America. > Master of his own fortunes and an empty pocket at 12 years he wrestled long > with fate before he gained a competence, although at his death he was worth > a million. In his conduct of the Times during his most successful years his > professional zeal swallowed every other consideration. > \\"He was without conscience, without any sense of propriety, had no regard > for morality, decency, or the good name of any living creature in his desire > to give 'the news.' Six years before his death his mind gave way, and for > many months he had been an imbecile, whose conception was too feeble to > comprehend the audacity of those who had already begun a quarrel over the > property accumulated by his own individual effort before he was borne away > to his unhonored grave.\\"Mattoon [IL] Gazette, vol. 15, no. 14 (Oct. 31, > 1884), p. 4.

Nicknamed Be Good, Simulambo had an outstanding career and played at the heart of Zambia‚Äôs midfield for close to ten years, representing the country at the 1974 and 1978 African Cup of Nations and was named Zambian captain in 1980. Early life Simulambo was born in Livingstone in a family of ten of which nine were boys. Two of his brothers would also go on to play football, Victor for Zamcoal Diggers in Maamba and Christopher for Nchanga Rangers. He lost his father at the age of ten and was a keen student who also loved playing soccer. He attended Church of Christ School before proceeding to Hillcrest Secondary School. Playing career Simulambo first featured for amateur side Livingstone Jets and played in the Zambia Schools squad leading to a call-up to the Zambia Olympic team, where he was spotted by First Division side Lusaka Tigers and when he completed school he moved to Lusaka and joined them in January 1972.\\"Schoolboy stars sign for Tigers,\\" Times of Zambia, 11 January 1972 At Tigers, Simulambo formed a good partnership with Stanley Phiri, Leonard Mwiinde and Joseph Njuka and in his first season, the team finished in a comfortable mid-table position. In October 1972, Simulambo‚Äôs former school master organised a trip to England where he spent six weeks training with Division I side Leeds United‚Äôs youth team and according to Simulambo, he impressed Leeds coach Don Revie whose recommendation that the club should sign him was turned down by the team‚Äôs board.\\"Simulambo back after Leeds stint,\\" Times of Zambia, 7 December 1972 Soon afterwards, he was snapped up by Zambia Army FC who were only in their second season in Zambia‚Äôs top flight and he helped the team to its first ever league title ahead of established teams like Mufulira Wanderers, Roan United and Kabwe Warriors. The team, which would later change its name to Green Buffaloes, had the likes of Dick Chama, Obby Kapita, Milton Muke, Francis Kajiya, Emmy Musonda, Felix Chalwe, Donwell Yobe and Pele Kaimana, and was a force to reckon with, winning the league three times in a row including 1974 when they ended the season unbeaten. It was here that Simulambo earned the nickname ‚ÄòMinister of the midfield‚Äô due to his usual dominance in the middle of the pitch. Simulambo also won the Shell Challenge Cup in 1975, 1977 and 1979, the Champion of Champions Cup in 1975 and 1979, the 1978 Heroes & Unity Cup, and the Charity Shield in 1974, 1978 and 1980. After eight seasons and five league titles with Buffaloes, Simulambo‚Äôs services with the army were terminated for undisclosed reasons in September 1980 and despite being told he was no longer with the army, he still went ahead to play his last game, an Independence Cup quarterfinal match against Red Arrows which Buffaloes won 3-1 due to his ‚Äòlove for the club,‚Äô while the team‚Äôs management said they would miss him and wished him well.\\"Simulambo quits ZNDF,\\" Zambia Daily Mail, 20 September 1980 He joined Kabwe Warriors and scored twice on his debut, a 3-1 win over Mufulira Wanderers in a league match on 1 October 1980, which came about two weeks after leaving the army.\\"Two goal Simulambo springs up in Warriors‚Äôcamp,\\" Times of Zambia, 2 October 1980 He did not stay at Warriors for long as he left to join promotion side Profund Warriors in February 1982.\\"Players flock to Profund,\\" Times of Zambia, 4 February 1982 At the end of the season, he was on the move again, moving to Mbabane Highlanders in Swaziland and is believed to be the first foreign player to have played there.\\"Jani flies out for soccer deal\\", Times of Zambia, 12 July 1983 He won several titles with Highlanders and his skillful play earned him the nickname ‚ÄòBe Good,‚Äô with the fans willing him to not get sent off or show way ward discipline as the team benefited greatly with him on the field of play. Simulambo also opened the way for his former teammates at Profund Warriors Texan Phiri, Ronald Chinku, Fred Kunda and Chola Mulundu to play in Swaziland. National team Simulambo was first selected to the Zambian Olympic team that faced Ethiopia in May 1971, when he was a student at Hillcrest Secondary School though the inexperienced team lost 7-3 on aggregate.\\"Zambia beaten again,\\" Times of Zambia, 31 May 1971 Later that year in November, Simulambo was in the Zambia B‚Äô‚Äô team that travelled to Tanzania for a tournament to mark that country‚Äôs 10th independence anniversary. He made his full international debut when Zambia eclipsed Nigeria 5-1 in a 1974 CAN qualifier in Lusaka, on their way to a 7-4 aggregate victory that qualified them to the CAN 1974. He featured for the ‚ÄòB‚Äô side again at ECA 1973 in Uganda as well as World Cup qualifiers against Zaire and Morocco and did enough to get a call-up to the CAN squad where he played in all the matches as Zambia went all the way to the final. He also featured at CAN 1978 where Zambia failed to make it out of their group and further represented Zambia in Olympics qualifiers and several CECAFA Cup tournaments. He succeeded Ackim Musenge as Zambian captain in January 1980 but his stint as captain was short-lived for after Zambia lost to the hosts in Zimbabwe‚Äôs independence tournament in April of that year, he was left out of the squad after injury and subsequent loss of form. As a result, he missed out on the Summer Olympic Games in Moscow. In March 1981, he was recalled to the Zambian squad by coach Ted Dumitru who expressed surprise that a player of his calibre was not in the team and it was only fair for him and football fans to give him another chance in the team.\\"Simulambo back in national team\\", Times of Zambia, 4 March 1981 He featured in the two legged CAN qualifier against Morocco and played a key role in a 3-2 aggregate victory as Zambia grabbed their ticket to CAN 1982. He was however dropped from the travelling party for reporting late to camp in February 1982 and that marked the end of his international career.\\"Simulambo sent back\\", Times of Zambia, 9 February 1982 Coaching career During his time at Highlanders where he was player-coach, Simulambo won five titles after which he left to join Mhlume FC in 1990. He was also attached to the Swaziland national team and one of his biggest achievements was beating Zambia 2-1 in a CAN qualifier in April 1991 in Mbabane, their first ever win over Zambia. He then coached Eleven Men in Flight where he won the BP Challenge Cup and had a stint with Moneni Pirates before being re-appointed Swaziland national team coach. He then crossed over to South African side Bush Bucks in 1998. Two years later, his contract was not renewed so he signed up with Black Leopards on a one-year contract. He was then engaged by Golden Arrows as Technical Director for two seasons and then replaced Louis Mabotsa as First Division Tembisa Classic Head Coach where he stayed for one season. When his contract was not renewed, he was hired by University of KwaZulu to drill the football team. It was during this period that he joined the Bay United Technical bench headed by Vladislav Heric and helped the team win promotion to the PSL. But when the team was demoted the following season, Simulambo was put in charge of the developmental side where he trained his three sons, Victor, Sizwe and Kamuzu. Personal life Simulambo married Victoria Tembo in February 1980 and they have seven children. Due to his love of Brazilian football, Simulambo gave his second born son the unusual first name of Brazil.\\"The Father of Brazil!\\" (translated from Portuguese) Sergio na copa, http://sergionacopa.blogspot.com/2010/07/57-o-pai-do-brazil.html (retrieved 8 September 2017) While in the Zambia Army, he rose to the rank of Captain and he is also a UK qualified accountant.

The temple is one of the 70 madakoil built by 2nd century Chola king, Kochengat Chola. The temple is known for the Panchabairavar, the five images of Bhairavar. The temple is revered in the verses of Tevaram, the 7th century Tamil Saiva canon by Tirugnana Sambandar. There are various inscriptions associated with the temple indicating contributions from Cholas. The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Thanjavur Nayaks during the 16th century. The temple is built in Dravidian architecture with a three-storied gopuram, the gateway tower. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Padikasunathar and Soundaranayagi being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls and two precincts.

Legend Image indicating the legend Pasupatheeswarar indicates God of cows. Shiva is believed to have descended for the holy cow Kamadenu that prayed to him by ablution with their milk on the Shivalingam to get relief from the curse of sage Vashista. A sculpture indicating the legend is present in the walls of the second precinct of the temple. Another legend associates the temple with the saivite saint Tirumular (6th century CE). Tirumular saw a herd of cows lamenting the death of their herdsmen. Being a siddha, he entered into the body of dead herdsman, came back alive to serve as the herdsman and sung 3000 verses in praise of Shiva. The legend is closely associated with Gomukteswarar temple at Tiruvadurai, but is also associated with other temples like Thenupuriswarar Temple at Patteswaram and Tirukogarnam near Pudukkottai. As per another legend, sage Vasishtha cursed the sacred cow Kamadhenu. To relieve off the curse, Kamadhenu sought the advice of Brahma who asked her to perform penance at this place. It is also believed that the presiding deity is believed to have been worshipped by the Devas, Saptarishi, Indra, Surya and Navagrahas, the nine planetary deities.

He is believed to have attained spiritual rebirth of a spider that fought with an elephant in its previous birth over the worship of the Hindu god Shiva. He had red eyes during birth as he remained in his mother's womb a little longer. His mother, looking into the babies red eyes said Kochengkannano (in Tamil ko=king, cheng=red, kan=eyes), which literally means king with red eyes and hence he was named Kochengat Cholan. After becoming a king, he followed saivism and built 70 Maadakovils, temples with elevated structure where elephants cannot reach the sanctum, in the Chola empire. The temple has an inscription (181 of 1911) dating from the 3rd year of the rule of Rajendra Chola III (1246-1279 CE) indicating grants of land to the temple.

Early life Mann was born in Hollywood, California. His father, Mack Andrew Mann, moved to California from Cassopolis, Michigan in the late 1800s and worked as a construction superintendent of railroad bridges. His mother, Jean Kline Mann, was also from Cassopolis. Mack and Jean met and married in Los Angeles, California. George Mann grew up in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles, moving to Santa Monica as a teenager with his parents. George was listed as the \\"Snaps Editor\\" as well as being responsible for all of the photography in the Athletic section of the Venice Union Polytechnic High High School 1925 Annual, The Gondolier. He was Vice President of the Junior A Class that would graduate in June 1926, but didn't graduate with his class. During his junior year, he was vice-president of the drama club and had a leading role in the play, \\"What Happened to Jones?\\" with Irene Hervey, then Irene Herwick. He played center on the varsity basketball team and was a member of the swimming team. Early career George studied dance with Roy Randolph of the Randolph's La Monica Dance School in Santa Monica, California. Shortly after turning 20, he developed a dance act - Mann & Clark - with his high school friend Lester Clark. Signing with the William Meiklejohn Agency, they performed together in Los Angeles for three or four months before George signed on as a single with Fanchon and Marco enterprises. George (6'6\\") was soon performing for comedic effect with a much shorter (4'11\\") Dewey Barto (father of the comedian Nancy Walker). Two days after George turned 21, George and Dewey signed a ten-year contract with Fanchon and Marco as the comedy team Barto and Mann. Barto and Mann During 1926, they performed up and down the west coast until William Morris of the William Morris Agency booked them ‚Äúcold\\" (having never appeared on the east coast) into the Palace Theatre on March 14, 1927 during its celebration of vaudeville's 100th anniversary. They were a great success. With offers from all the major vaudeville circuits, they chose to sign with the Orpheum Circuit, with whom they toured across the U.S. until they signed with the Earl Carroll's Vanities from August 1928 to February 1929. They continued touring in the U.S. and Canada, with European tours in the summers of 1931 and 1934. George met Barbara Bradford, a top model at the John Robert Powers modeling agency, in March 1936. They were married in June 1937. In 1938, George and Barbara appeared in a very short film directed by George starring The Three Stooges. George and Barbara had one son, Brad, born in February 1941. George and Barbara were divorced in June 1943. George never remarried. As vaudeville faded, Barto & Mann joined the Broadway cast of Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson's Hellzapoppin, with featured billing from 1938 through 1942. The team split up in December 1943 when George began working for Douglas Aircraft Company providing entertainment for Douglas employees, but worked together again briefly to perform with the USO. Photographer Following World War II, George acted in small roles in several movies, on the stage, and with Jack Carson's stage revue but primarily devoted himself to making a living with photography, an activity he had pursued actively while in vaudeville when he took about 12,000 black and white photographs, many of them demonstrating an extraordinary skill and aesthetic sensibility. He also took thousands of feet of B&W; and color 16mm film. In the late 1940s, George began a period of invention, first designing and obtaining a patent for an endless magnetic loop recording and playback device, elements of which were later incorporated into the Lear Jet Stereo 8 track cartridge player. George and Bill Lear became close friends after George introduced Bill to his future wife, Ole Olsen's daughter Moya. George next turned his inventive and mechanical skills to designing a 3-D viewer that would display the 3-D photographs he was taking with his 35mm Stereo Realist cameras, mostly around Southern California. He leased the viewers to various businesses, including restaurants, and doctor's offices where people sometimes had to wait for service. Every couple of weeks, George would swap out the 3-D photographs of such places as Calico Ghost Town, Catalina Island, Descanso Gardens, Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, Pacific Ocean Park, Watts Towers, Palm Springs, Salton Sea or Las Vegas. He also leased his viewers to bars in Los Angeles with photographs of nude pinups he had taken. King Vitaman In the early 1970s, George was hired by Quaker Oats to portray King Vitaman in commercials and on the front of the King Vitaman cereal box. George Mann lived in Santa Monica, California at the time of his death on November 23, 1977 at age 71.

This is to prevent a dangerous buildup of gas within the appliance, its chimney or the room. Causes of flame failure include chimney downdraught, temporary interruption of the gas supply, gas under-pressure, liquid overspill on cooker hotplates or the draught from an oven door being opened and closed. FSDs may utilize one of several technologies: thermoelectric valves, flame conductance, flame rectification, ultraviolet sensing devices and liquid expansion valves. FSD usage in consumer products differs among political units ‚Äì in the U.S., FSDs are not required by law or regulation for gas range (or gas stove) top burners and consequently are not present on ranges in the U.S. Cooker hotplates may not have a FSD on each burner. If a hotplate is to be used in a multi-occupancy building every burner must have its own FSD. When the FSD activates it should stop (or reduce to safe levels) gas flow to the burner until it is reset manually. Older devices, such as bimetallic strips, were used in conjunction with pilot lights. The pilot light is no longer used in new devices, but may still be encountered on old appliances still in service. Pilot lights were withdrawn because their continual small flame represented a waste of fuel. Pilot lights required their own FSD, typically a thermocouple which held the valve open. Regular testing of FSD is a part of routine maintenance for gas appliances. Other safety devices may be fitted in addition to an FSD. One type of these are the Vitiation Sensing Devices, that detect an adequate supply of oxygen for efficient combustion, thus avoiding the production of poisonous carbon monoxide. As well as detecting a blocked supply of oxygen, these must also detect a blocked exhaust or reversed flow in the exhaust flue owing to wind conditions. Two methods are used to provide these, an Oxygen Depletion System (ODS) that measures the availability of oxygen for combustion or an Atmospheric Sensing Device (ASD) measures excess heat rise in the exhaust.

It was built between 1888 and 1892 according to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res, the fort was built exclusively of unreinforced concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. In 1914 the fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Namur. Dave was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the fortified position of Namur in an attempt to forestall or slow an attack from Germany. It saw action in 1940 during the Battle of Belgium, and was captured by German forces. The fort is now abandoned on state property. Description The Fort de Dave is located about south of the center of Namur. The fort, one of the smaller Brialmont forts, is a triangle overlooking the Meuse. A deep by ditch encircles the fort. The ditches were defended in enfilade by 57mm guns in casemates resembling counterscarp batteries, firing at shot traps at the other end of the ditch. The principal armament was concentrated in the central massif, closely grouped in a solid mass of concrete. Belgian forts made little provision for the daily needs of their wartime garrisons, locating latrines, showers, kitchens and the morgue in the fort's counterscarp, a location that would be untenable in combat. This would have profound effects on the forts' ability to endure a long assault. The service areas were placed directly opposite the barracks, which opened into the ditch in the rear of the fort (i.e., in the face towards Namur), with lesser protection than the front and \\"salient\\" sides. The Brialmont forts placed a weaker side to the rear to allow for recapture by Belgian forces from the rear, and located the barracks and support facilities on this side, using the rear ditch for light and ventilation of living spaces. In combat heavy shellfire made the rear ditch untenable, and German forces were able to get between the forts and attack them from the rear.Donnell, p. 36 The Brialmont forts were designed to be protected from shellfire equaling their heaviest guns: 21cm.Donnell, p. 52 The top of the central massif used of unreinforced concrete, while the caserne walls, judged to be less exposed, used .Donnell, p. 12 Under fire, the forts were damaged by 21cm fire and could not withstand heavier artillery.Donnell, pp. 45-48 The three forts on the right bank of the Meuse were linked by a military railway. Armament Dave's guns included one twin 15cm turret, one single 21cm turret and two twin 12cm turrets, all for distant targets. Three 57mm turrets with another six 57mm guns in embrasures providing defense of the fort's ditches and postern. The fort also mounted an observation turret with a searchlight.Donnell, p. 17 The fort's heavy guns were German, typically Krupp, while the turret mechanisms were from a variety of sources. The fort was provided with signal lights to permit communication with neighboring forts. The guns were fired using black powder rather than smokeless powder, producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort. World War I The forts of Namur In 1914 the Fort de Dave was commanded by Captain-Commandant Manteau, with 269 artillerymen and 82 fortress troops. Dave was first attacked on 20 August, and resisted until the 25th, when it surrendered honorably. Fortified Position of Namur Dave's armament was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the Fortified Position of Namur, which was planned to deter a German incursion over the nearby border.Donnell, pp. 55-56 Protection was substantially increased and armament was modernized. This was accompanied by improvements to ventilation, protection, sanitary facilities, communications and electrical power. The area surrounding the fort was equipped with improved shelters for the interval troops, with two large shelters, called Rel√®ve and Troonois, nearby. The new air intake was camouflaged into the rocky bluff overlooking the Meuse, to the northwest. It also provided protected access to the Rel√®ve and Troonois blockhouses. Weapons in 1940 included one twin 75mm turret, three single retracting 75mm turrets, two observation cloches and a twin machine gun cloche. T=The entrance was defended by two machine gun positions and a grenade launcher. The Abri de la Rel√®ve was defended by two machine guns and an observation cloche, and the Abri du Troonois had two machine guns and a 60mm anti-tank gun. Second World War The Fort de Dave was commanded in 1940 by Captain-Commandant Noel. It was first attacked by invading German forces on 15 May, 1940 and surrendered honorably on 24 May, with one dead. Present The Fort de Dave is not open to the public and remains state property. Most of the metal was salvaged from the site and was used for testing explosives.Donnell, p. 17 It was never repaired or rehabilitated after World War II.Donnell, p. 59 References Bibliography  *Donnell, Clayton, The Forts of the Meuse in World War I, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2007, . *Kauffmann, J.E., Jurga, R., Fortress Europe: European Fortifications of World War II, Da Capo Press, USA, 2002, .

At Computer Terminal Corporation (later renamed Datapoint Corporation), he co-created the architecture that was ultimately implemented in the first successful computer microprocessor, the Intel 8008. Subsequently, Computer Terminal Corporation created the first personal computer, the Datapoint 2200 programmable terminal. Early life Victor Dale Poor was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Pinckney Peyton Poor and Leona Lucille Poor (n√©e Mallory). With a passion for radio, he built his own transceiver from collected discarded pieces, and qualified on amateur radio in 1951 (callsign W6JSO). After high school, Poor joined the United States Navy. While attending electronics training at the Treasure Island Naval Base in 1952, he met his wife, Florence, in a church in San Francisco. On completing his training the couple married in November 1952, and he was then assigned to Ford Island naval base, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Career On leaving the Navy in 1955, Poor joined the telecommunications technology team at Stromberg- Carlson in San Diego, California. Trained in computer programming, he wrote his first programme in 1956 for the UNIVAC 1103. Recruited by Raytheon, the couple then moved to Massachusetts. Although Poor did not attend college, he took electronics training classes both in the Navy and at Raytheon. A quick learner, he soon knew more than his instructors and began teaching classes himself. Poor then moved to Maryland to help form radio and telegraph equipment manufacturer Frederick Electronics. Quickly made an executive, he developed the idea of adapting radioteletype (RTTY) machines to send data wirelessly. These were then sold to both the United States Army and later commercial media customers, such as the Associated Press, to send affiliated news reports as data around the world. =Computer engineering= Poor continued his research and development, trying to develop a method for sending photographs and pictures wirelessly. In 1969 while working his notice period from Frederick Electronics, during the Thanksgiving holiday, Poor and fellow amateur radio colleague Harry Pyle produced the underlying architecture of the modern microprocessor on a living room floor. They then asked fellow radio amateur Jonathan Schmidt to write the accompanying communications software. Pitching the idea to both Texas Instruments and Intel, the partnership developed the Intel 8008, the forerunner of the microprocessor chips found in today's personal and computing devices. In late 1969, Poor joined start-up computer company Computer Terminal Corporation as Technical Director in San Antonio, Texas. Founded by two former NASA engineers, Phil Ray and Gus Roche, they asked him to approach Intel to see how much of his design could fit onto a computer chip. Pitching a $100,000 proposal to place the architecture onto silicon and into production, the project became the Intel 8008 master chip, the world's first 8-bit microprocessor. Poor and Pyle then developed the instruction set architecture which enabled Ray and Roche to design and develop the mass-produced programmable Datapoint 2200 computer terminal. As a result of the success of this product, the company changed its name to Datapoint. Datapoint remained one generation ahead of Intel until the Intel 80286. Overseeing the development of ARCNET by lead ARCNET architect John Murphy, an early local area network, Poor stayed with Datapoint until 1984, after they had lost their technical microchip lead to IBM and been bought out by corporate raiders. He \\"retired\\" with his wife on the profits that he had made from the 15 year growth in Datapoint stock, deciding to go sailing. After sailing across the Atlantic Ocean, they spent the first summer in the Mediterranean on the Gulfstar yacht Elsinore, named after the location of the castle in Shakespeare‚Äôs \\"Hamlet\\". =Amateur radio= The challenges of communicating by radio while at sea (callsign W5SMM) led Poor to develop software that integrates Internet with amateur radio to store and forward messages; this system is today part of a major amateur-supported emergency communications network. While sailing, Poor wanted a better way to communicate with those around him. This led to him developing, in 1985, the original computer program, APlink (AMTOR-Packet Link). Then as part of a group of radio amateurs, acting as the architect Poor helped to developed what became Winlink. Both of these systems would automatically store and forward messages between amateur radio stations. With no one in the group able to take royalties due to the amateur radio regulations, the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) later adopted APlink for their National Traffic System (NTS) digital messages. The system was widely adopted by radio amateurs, the United States military, and state and local emergency preparedness teams. It was credited with being one of the few communications systems that worked in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Retirement In 1994, Poor was recruited as the President of Airnet, a spinoff from Harris Corporation, based in Melbourne, Florida. Proposing to his wife that they would soon be home in San Antonio, at the end of his 2.5 year tenure they retired to Brevard County, Florida instead. On December 8, 2004, Gardner Hendrie and Len Shustek of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, recorded \\"The Oral History of Victor Poor.\\" Poor's lifelong hobbies were operating amateur radio, flying airplanes, and sailing boats. Poor and his wife Florence loved to sail. Their earliest cruises were out of Corpus Christi, Texas, and included adventures to the Yucat√°n peninsula. In 1984, the couple sailed their 50-ft sloop Elsinore across the Atlantic Ocean and toured the western Mediterranean Sea; between 1988 and 1990, they lived aboard a 37-ft catamaran Aransas Light and explored the coastlines of the Gulf of Mexico, the Bahamas, and the eastern seaboard as far north as Chesapeake Bay; between 1990 and 1994 they moved to a Diesel- powered 50-ft trawler Excalibur to sightsee along the Inland Waterway between Seattle, Washington, and Skagway, Alaska. In May 2012, Poor was diagnosed with Stage IV pancreatic cancer. On July 9, Poor was awarded the ARRL President's Award at the Platinum Coast Amateur Radio Society annual meeting, for a lifetime of achievements. There have been only a handful of recipients of this prestigious award. Poor died early on the morning of August 17, 2012, at William Childs Hospice House in Palm Bay, Florida.

Premise The series was hosted by American Norm Crosby and Canadians Mike Darow and Catherine McKinnon. Moe Koffman led a studio orchestra. Guest entertainers during the series run included Canadian and international entertainers such as Tony Bennett, Burns and Schreiber, Rosemary Clooney, Ella Fitzgerald, Rich Little, Oscar Peterson, Martin Short and Grant Smith. Production John Aylesworth and Frank Peppiatt, the writing team who also created Hee Haw, produced Everything Goes. Series writers included Dan Aykroyd, Don Cullen, Ken Finkleman, Earl Pomerantz and Martin Short. Scheduling The series was initially scheduled to air at 10:45 p.m. It faced unexpected competition from The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson when the United States introduced daylight saving time in January 1974 due to the 1973 oil crisis. Carson's series was traditionally seen in Ontario at 11:30 p.m., but Canada remained at standard time ‚Äî which meant that 11:30 p.m. in the United States was still 10:30 p.m. in Canada, putting the shows in direct competition. Unable to simply readjust its entire schedule to move the program out of Carson's way, the network quickly added a repeat airing at 4 p.m. the following afternoon. 100 episodes of Everything Goes were produced at a cost of $1.5 million, providing much of Global's Canadian content requirements. After the series completed a 20-week run on 24 May 1974, the weekday evening time slot was replaced by the Global News Hour from 10:30 p.m. By that time, Global encountered financial difficulties which led to the cancellation of Everything Goes and many of its other series by that August. Some U.S. stations aired the show as well. WAGA Atlanta carried the show during the winter and spring of 1974 at 5 p.m. against reruns of The Mod Squad on WSB and Bonanza on WXIA. By summer the station was airing The Mike Douglas Show at that time, and would continue to do so for six years. Reception Toronto television ratings from BBM Canada indicated that the evening broadcasts of Everything Goes attracted a one to two percent audience share at the end of its first month. It competed against The Merv Griffin Show which attracted 7 to 10 percent of the ratings, while The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson received 20 to 25 percent of the audience. Afternoon rebroadcasts received one percent of the viewership as it competed with a 25 percent share for The Mike Douglas Show. Ray Bennett of the Windsor Star noted that the series was \\"effortlessly Canadian, not forced in the manner of so many CBC shows which come out with a maple leaf front and centre\\", although faulting it for one audience participation segment of \\"a mindless bit of business which is usually a written dramatic scene intended to be funny\\". Bennett further noted that the Burns and Schreiber guest performances involved \\"routines that would never see the light of day on U.S. networks.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1970s Canadian variety television series Category:Global Television Network original programming Category:1974 Canadian television series debuts Category:1974 Canadian television series endings ","title":"Everything Goes (Canadian TV series)"},{"id":"36751702","text":"Liam Walsh may refer to: *Liam Walsh (boxer) (born 1986), English boxer * Liam Walsh (footballer) (born 1997), English footballer * Liam Walsh (hurler) (born 1963), Irish former hurler * Liam Walsh (rugby league) (born 1998), rugby league player ","title":"Liam Walsh"},{"id":"36751710","text":"your bitcoinHans Voigt (21 February 1896 ‚Äì 26 April 1969) was a highly decorated Generalmajor in the Wehrmacht during World War II.
