Miller's first three editing credits were also for films co-edited by Allen, commencing with The Milagro Beanfield War (directed by Robert Redford – 1988). Following Let It Ride (directed by Joe Pytka – 1989), he and Allen co- edited The Addams Family (1991), which was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. Miller then worked (without Allen) as the editor for five more of Sonnenfeld's films, including Men in Black (1997) and Wild Wild West (1999). In addition to their Academy Award nomination, Miller and Rubell's editing of Collateral was honored by nominations for the ACE Eddie Award, BAFTA Award for Best Editing, and the Satellite Award for Best Editing, which they won.

It was discovered on 2 March 1981, by American astronomer Schelte Bus at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. The likely S-type asteroid was named for the McGraw-Hill Telescope located at Kitt Peak, Arizona.  Orbit and classification  McGraw-Hill is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 1.9–2.9 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,346 days; semi-major axis of 2.39 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 0° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as at Purple Mountain Observatory in October 1964. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in February 1977, or four years prior to its official discovery observation at Siding Spring.  Physical characteristics  McGraw-Hill is an assumed, stony S-type asteroid, in agreement with the albedo (see below) obtained by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). = Rotation period = During the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Lightcurve Survey, McGraw-Hill has been observed photometrically. The observations gave a small brightness variation of 0.06 magnitude but resulted in no useful rotational lightcurve (). As of 2018, the body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, McGraw- Hill measures 3.042 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.254, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a stony asteroid of 0.20 and derives a diameter of 3.43 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 14.69.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the 1.3-meter McGraw-Hill Telescope located at the MDM Observatory at the Kitt Peak National Observatory site in Arizona, United States. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 February 1992 ().

He attended Southern Illinois University, where he played college baseball. He is the father of Jim Adduci, who currently plays for the Chicago Cubs. Career On June 7, 1977, Adduci, after graduating from Chicago's Brother Rice High school, was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 28th round of the amateur draft. However, Adduci chose to continue his education instead. On June 3, 1980, Adduci was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 7th round of the amateur draft. Adduci made his major league debut on September 12, 1983, with the Cardinals. Adduci was hitless in his only at bat in his debut. That year, Adduci had a batting average of .050 in 20 at bats. On October 2, 1984, he was traded with Paul Householder to the Milwaukee Brewers for three minor leaguers. Adduci made his Brewers debut in 1986, and had a batting average of .091 in 11 at-bats that season. On April 19, 1987, Adduci was purchased by the San Francisco Giants from the Milwaukee Brewers, only to be sent back to Milwaukee a week later. On June 4, 1987, the Brewers released Adduci. Adduci finished 1987 playing for the Yokohama Taiyo Whales in Japan. Adduci re-signed with the Brewers on January 18, 1988. That season, he had a batting average of .266 in 94 at-bats. Since he had three sacrifice flies, his on-base percentage was lower than his batting average, which is a very rare occurrence in Major League Baseball. Prior to the 1989 season, Adduci was sent to the Philadelphia Phillies, hitting .368 in 19 at-bats. Adduci played his final major league game on July 26, 1989. After the 1989 season, he was granted free agency and never returned to the major leagues. Adduci had a career batting average of .236, in 144 at-bats over the course of 70 games. All 15 of his career runs batted in came in the 1988 season, as well as his only career home run. Post-playing career After retirement following a 1990 season spent in the minor leagues, the Chicago native Adduci entered DePaul University, and in 1991 he earned a communications media degree. He ran summer baseball camps for the cities of Evergreen Park and Oak Lawn. As parents requested private instruction for their children, Adduci decided to open a storefront children's baseball school in Chicago, and ran it there through the summer of 1992. As of 1993, Adduci was living in Evergreen Park, with his wife, two daughters and a son. He was running the baseball school in a more spacious location in Tinley Park. Fellow ex-professionals Steve Otto and Tim Pyznarski were on staff helping Adduci as instructors. Although feeling professional baseball was too much of a business and that he did not get a shot at a major-league career, Adduci said he loved baseball and building up kids' self-esteem by teaching them the sport. During his playing career, he befriended players like Paul Molitor and Andy Van Slyke, who named Adduci the godfather of his son. Currently, Adduci works for the Chicago Bulls/Sox Training Academy as the director of the White Sox Elite baseball program and as a hitting instructor.

Hilliard's ongoing body of work addresses the specificity of photography as a medium: its uncertainty as a representational device and its status within the visual arts, especially in relation to painting, cinema and commercial photography. Education Born in Lancaster, Hilliard studied at Lancaster College of Art from 1962 to 1964, and then at Saint Martin's School of Art, London, until 1967. He began his interest in photography as an art student in the 1960s, first using the camera simply to capture images of his site-specific art installations. Soon, he recognised there was bias inherent in photography—the camera could not be completely neutral—and he explored the manipulation of the photographic process and its results.. Art In the 1970s, Hilliard examined how changes to the process of black and white photography could affect the outcome. His art showed how the camera's notional objectivity was vulnerable to decisions made by the photographer leading up to the instant of the exposure, as well as subsequent decisions made in the darkroom concerning paper selection and development techniques. Hilliard's 1971 work, Camera Recording Its Own Condition consisted of a display of 70 snapshots taken by a camera aimed at a mirror, showing itself at the moment of exposure, the snapshots differing by film speed, exposure time, and aperture size. The 70 images were laid out in a rigid grid with one optimal \\"correct\\" image in the center. This changing of the mechanics of each shot revealed the intention of the unseen photographer. In 1974, Hilliard showed in Cause of Death four images of the same human body covered in a sheet. The images were taken from the same photographic negative but each one suggested a different cause of death, accomplished by cropping the print to modify context. Each image was given its own one-word title to indicate a narrative: \\"Crushed\\", \\"Drowned\\", \\"Burned\\", and \\"Fell\\". Photographer Chris Steele-Perkins wrote that, in Cause of Death, \\"framing affects the way a photograph is read\\", and that Hilliard provides the viewer with \\"elegant forensic evidence that, although the camera cannot lie, photographs tell different truths.\\" University of Ulster photography professor Terence Wright noted that Cause of Death is a formalist piece in which the process is revealed, and that many of Hilliard's works fall into this classification. In the 1980s colour photography in popular culture became the subject of Hilliard's semiotic scrutiny. He was especially interested in how photography targeted a desired result in advertising and media. He challenged the viewer to re-examine an Asian woman's portrait in East/West, 1986, showing how the stylised profile can be manipulated to represent different cultural attitudes. In response to a 1989 show, Chicago Tribune art critic Alan G. Artner wrote that Hilliard purposely clouds the difference between painting and photography, and that he \\"dramatize[s] issues specific to the photographic medium.\\" In the 1990s Hilliard's work evolved a stronger chroma, push processing, saturation, and seductive gloss, the subjects arranged to portray a narrative that was perhaps violent or erotic. At the same time, the viewer is prevented from complete comprehension of context by interposed objects obscuring portions of the scene. For instance his work Miss Tracy, 1994 shows what is assumed to be a nude woman face down on a bloody sheet, the center of the image blocked by a large rectangle leaving the peripheral region as the only source of understanding. In the mid-1990s Hilliard further expanded the scale of his photographic works by printing on canvas or vinyl, the size approaching that of a mural. He continued to present the viewer with a disruption of full understanding, a critical comment on the viewing process. Exhibits From Christmas 1983 to mid-June 1984, Hilliard's art was shown in Germany at the Kölnischer Kunstverein, the Kunsthalle Bremen, and the Frankfurter Kunstverein. Art historian and critic Jean Fisher wrote a biographical piece and analysed the works for a 69-page museum book edited by art historian and publisher Peter Weiermair. In early 1989, an exhibit of Hilliard's large scale works was featured for one month at Chicago's Renaissance Society museum. The works consisted of large Cibachrome and Scanachrome prints, the latter being saturated colour applied to canvas using dyes. A 30-page book on Hilliard's work to date was printed for the event, with 19 images by Hilliard, and critical art analysis written by Fisher. In 1999, a major retrospective of Hilliard's works was mounted, and shown in three German art galleries. In 2003, German publisher Verlag das Wunderhorn published a monograph of his works, entitled The Less Said The Better, with an accompanying solo exhibit in Amsterdam.John Hilliard, \\"the less said the better\\", UCL discovery, retrieved 29 August 2012. Career Hilliard taught for a time at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts. He was later associated with the Slade School of Fine Art, University College London, serving as professor, the head of Graduate Fine Art Media, the director of Graduate Programmes, and a tutor of graduate students. Currently, Hilliard lives and works in London.

In 1982, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The theater closed in 1986; the retail building built around it was damaged in the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake and demolished in 1992. The remaining theater building was left vacant for more than 20 years as preservationists fought with owners and developers over the future of the building.Future of 1927-era East L.A. theater in question, May 14, 2009 It was finally converted into a drugstore and reopened in 2012. Theater building The theater seated nearly 1,500 people and was located at one of the major intersections on the east side of Los Angeles, at the corner of Whittier and Atlantic Boulevards. The theater was built by Peter Snyder, known as the \\"Father of the East Side,\\" and designed by architects William and Clifford A. Balch, creators of the El Rey Theater on Wilshire Boulevard and the Pomona Fox Theater in Pomona, California. It was designed in the ornate Churrigueresque style, and the entrance replicated the portal of Spain's University of Salamanca. When plans for the theater were announced in 1927, the Los Angeles Times reported: > This week will mark the beginning of building operations on the theater > project on Whittier Boulevard in Golden Gate Square. The theater proper will > seat about 1500 persons, it is declared and will contain thirteen stores. > There will also be several apartment units. It is planned as a legitimate > playhouse, but will be equipped for motion pictures as well. The theater was originally located in the courtyard of the L-shaped Vega Building, a retail structure that wrapped around the theater. The Vega Building was known for its four-story octagon tower. Los Angeles County records describing the basis for the landmark designation describe the complex as one with \\"a sense of time and place. The majority of its structural features, including its conformation, detailing and decorative elements, have been unaltered. As a result, the building has clearly retained a sense of architectural integrity and original design.\\" Closure and earthquake damage Golden Gate Theater in 1980 with the Vega Building intact The theater stopped showing movies in 1986, and in 1987 the Vega Building was damaged in the Whittier Narrows earthquake. From 1986-1988, a non-denominational Christian church named Praise Chapel Christian Fellowship occupied the building and held regular services with over 1,000 people. In 1987 the pastors, Mike and Donna Neville were forced to move their church because, according to the owner, the building was condemned following the Whittier earthquake. The Vega Building was demolished in 1992 after officials determined it to be a hazard. The remaining theater building was left sitting vacant in the middle of an otherwise empty lot. One writer notes that the remaining shell \\"only hints at what this theater was like in its heyday.\\" Preservation battles The property has been vacant and the subject of attempted demolitions for many years. When the Whittier earthquake damaged the Vega Building, demolition efforts accelerated. County inspectors declared the building unsafe for occupancy, and businesses operating in the building, including a jewelry store, a shoe repair shop, and a bowling alley, were evicted. In 1988, demolition commenced before officials led by then County Supervisor Ed Edelman halted the work with a stop-work order. Demolition crews had already begun to dismantle the walls when Edelman, then Los Angeles City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, sheriff's deputies and more than 50 concerned community members showed up at the site to ensure the demolition work was halted. Edelman blamed a \\"foul-up\\" in the Public Works Department for issuing the demolition permit and assured the gathered crowd that heads were going to roll and that he would \\"try and stop this damn demolition before it happens.\\" \\"Demolition crews had swept onto the site at the corner of Whittier and Atlantic boulevards Tuesday and Wednesday, and began to dismantle some walls. But they were halted by a stop-work order obtained from the county Public Works Department through the efforts of Supervisor Ed Edelman.\\" In 1992, the Vega Building was razed, and in 1994, the family that had owned the property for 20 years sought to have the building removed from the National Register of Historic Places to clear the way for potential demolition of the theater. The Mothers of East Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Conservancy fought the demolition plans. The Conservancy noted that the theatre was one of fewer than two dozen buildings in Los Angeles in the Spanish Churrigueresque style. In August 1994, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, on a motion by Supervisor Gloria Molina, designated the theatre as a \\"historical resource.\\" The State Historical Resources Commission also rejected the owner's request to remove the theatre from the National Register of Historic Places. In 2003, the property was acquired by M&A; Gabaee, an affiliate of the Charles Co. Rumors spread that the new owner planned to convert the property into a Walgreens Drug Store. A representative of the owner told the Los Angeles Times: \\"We're in negotiations so everything is preliminary. We plan to keep the structure. The building is absolutely gorgeous. We want to maintain that but we also want to find what's going to work. We're looking forward to rejuvenating it.\\" Preservationists expressed concerns that the new plans would preserve the outer shell of the building but gut or significantly alter the building's interior. In particular, concerns were raised that the theatre's soaring interior and proscenium arch would be replaced with a dropped ceiling. The founder of the East Los Angeles Center for the Performing Arts proposed converting the theatre into a performing arts venue: \\"It's an amazing theater. We were trying to get support to renovate and turn it into a performing arts venue. There's a drugstore on every corner here. I'd love to see the developer team up with us to preserve it.\\" As of 2008, the proposed conversion of the theatre was still the subject of ongoing preservation efforts by the Los Angeles Conservancy. The Conservancy stated that it sought to preserve historic interior features, including the proscenium, lobby, clamshell-shaped concession stand, and mezzanine level, while \\"encouraging the adaptive reuse of this long-vacant historic property.\\" On May 25, 2010, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved the conversion of the theater into a 24-hour drug store. It opened as a CVS on August 19, 2012.http://www.theeastsiderla.com/2012/08/former-east-l-a-movie-palace- debuts-in-new-role-as-drug-store/ See also * List of Registered Historic Places in Los Angeles References External links * More L.A.

It has a relatively unusual γ-bond between the constituent amino acids, L-glutamic acid and L-cysteine and is a key intermediate in the gamma (γ) -glutamyl cycle first described by Meister in the 1970s. It is the most immediate precursor to the antioxidant glutathione.  Biosynthesis  GGC is synthesized from L-glutamic acid and L-cysteine in the cytoplasm of virtually all cells in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) requiring reaction catalysed by the enzyme glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL, EC 6.3.2.2; formerly γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase). The production of GGC is the rate limiting step in glutathione synthesis. = Occurrence = GGC occurs in human plasma in the range of 1 – 5 µM and intracellularly at 5 – 10 µM. The intracellular concentration is generally low because GGC is rapidly bonded with a glycine to form glutathione. This second and final reaction step in glutathione biosynthesis is catalysed by the activity of the ATP dependent glutathione synthetase enzyme. = Importance = GGC is essential to mammalian life. Mice that have had the glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) gene knocked out do not develop beyond the embryo stage and die before birth. This is because GGC is vital for the biosynthesis of glutathione. Since the production of cellular GGC in humans slows down with age, as well as during the progression of many chronic diseases, it has been postulated that supplementation with GGC could offer health benefits. Such GGC supplementation may also be of benefit in situations where glutathione has been acutely lowered below optimum, such as following strenuous exercise, during trauma or episodes of poisoning. Several review articles have been published exploring the therapeutic potential of GGC to replenish glutathione in age related and chronic disease states such as Alzheimer’s disease. GGC is also capable of being a powerful antioxidant in its own right. = Availability = GGC synthesis for commercial use is exceedingly difficult and, until recently, no commercially viable process for large scale production had been developed. The major drawback preventing the commercial success of chemical synthesis of GGC is the number of steps involved due to the three reactive groups on L-glutamic acid and L-cysteine molecules, which must be masked to achieve the correct regioisomer. Similarly, there have been numerous attempts at biological production of GGC by fermentation over the years and none have been successfully commercialised. Towards the end of 2019, a biocatalytic process was developed in Australia and has been patented and commercialised. GGC is now available as a supplement in the US under the trademarked name of Glyteine and sold as a formulated supplement under the Continual G brand.  Bioavailability and supplementation  A human clinical study in healthy, non-fasting adults demonstrated that orally administered GGC can significantly increase lymphocyte GSH levels indicating systemic bioavailability, validating the therapeutic potential of GGC, Animal model studies with GGC have supported a potential therapeutic role for GGC in both the reduction of oxidative stress induced damage in tissues, including the brain and as a treatment for sepsis. In contrast, supplementation with glutathione is incapable of increasing cellular glutathione since the GSH concentration found in the extracellular environment is much lower than that found intracellularly by about a thousand-fold. This large difference means that there is an insurmountable concentration gradient that prohibits extracellular glutathione from entering cells. Although currently unproven, GGC may be the pathway intermediate of glutathione transportation in multicellular organisms  Safety  Safety assessment of GGC sodium salt in rats has shown that orally administered (gavage) GGC was not acutely toxic at the limit single dosage of 2000 mg/kg (monitored over 14 days) and demonstrated no adverse effects following repeated daily doses of 1000 mg/kg over 90 days.  History  In 1983, pioneers of glutathione research, Mary E. Anderson and Alton Meister, were the first to report on the ability of GGC to augment cellular GSH levels in a rat model [3]. Intact GGC, which was synthesised in their own laboratory, was shown to be taken up by cells, bypassing the rate-limiting step of the GCL enzyme to be converted to glutathione. Control experiments with combinations of the constituent amino acids that make up GGC, including L-glutamic acid and L-cysteine, were ineffective. Since this initial work, only a few studies using GGC were performed due to the fact that there was no commercial source of GGC on the market. Subsequently, GGC has become commercially available and studies investigating its efficacy have commenced.

Between 1992 and 2008, the schools did not play each other when Arkansas left the Southwest Conference to join the Southeastern Conference. The rivalry was renewed as a neutral-site out-of-conference contest (and branded as The Southwest Classic) in 2009; in 2012 it once again became a conference rivalry when Texas A&M; also joined the Southeastern Conference. Arkansas leads the series 41–32–3. Series history Arkansas and Texas A&M; first played each other in 1903, and would play each other three times from 1903 to 1912, all as non-conference matchups. Arkansas and Texas A&M; would not meet on the field again until 1927, notwithstanding that both schools became charter members of the Southwest Conference twelve years earlier in 1915. The schools played annually from 1927 to 1930, but would not meet again until 1934. From 1934 to 1991, the two teams played annually as conference members. The annual matchup ceased in 1991 when Arkansas left the conference to join the Southeastern Conference. On March 10, 2008, officials from both schools announced the series would recommence on October 3, 2009, under the name \\"Southwest Classic.\\" The annual location for the game was announced as Cowboys Stadium (now called AT&T; Stadium), located in Arlington. The attendance for the stadium was initially expected to be in the 80,000 range. Depending on ticket demand, temporary seating can be added to the stadium to increase the capacity up to 100,000 seats for the game. The tickets were said to be split 50/50 between the two schools. The initial agreement between the two schools allowed the game to be played for at least 10 years, followed by 5 consecutive, 4-year rollover options, allowing the game to potentially be played for a total of 30 consecutive seasons. The rivalry once again became a conference matchup when Texas A&M; joined the SEC on July 1, 2012, and became a member of the West Division of the conference alongside Arkansas. However, for Texas A&M;'s first two seasons in the SEC the series was played as a home- and-home series at the schools' campuses (Texas A&M; hosted in 2012 and Arkansas hosted in 2013); the series resumed neutral-site play in AT&T; Stadium for the 2014 season until at least 2024. Multiple athletic directors at Texas A&M; have expressed a desire to move away from playing the game at AT&T; Stadium, and on July 20, 2020, it was reported that the game would be played at Kyle Field due to precautions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, with a return trip potentially being played at Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium in 2021. Since joining the SEC in 2012, A&M; holds an undefeated record in the series. This 8-game winning streak is its longest in the series between these teams and first winning streak of more than 2 games in the series for the Aggies since 1941-43. Game results Notable games = 1903 – First Meeting = Texas A&M; 6 – Arkansas 0 In the first ever meeting, and only the 43rd game ever played by Arkansas and the 42nd ever played by Texas A&M;, the Aggies won 6–0. The Aggies were coached by J. E. Platt and the Razorbacks were coached (in his only season as a head coach) by D. A. McDaniel. = 1937 – First Ranking in Series = Arkansas 26 – Texas A&M; 13 After the introduction of the AP Poll in the 1936 season, the first ranking in the series came just the next year, with defending conference champions Arkansas being ranked #20 prior to the matchup. The Hogs pitched an 18-0 shutout, their third time forcing a shutout in the series and the fifth shutout overall in the series. = 1939 – Texas A&M;'s National Championship year = Texas A&M; 27 – Arkansas 0 In 1939, after winning the game 27–0, the Aggies went on to an overall record of 11–0 and named the college football national champions in the Associated Press writers' poll for the 1939 college football season. = 1964 – Arkansas's National Championship year = Arkansas 17 – Texas A&M; 0 In 1964, after winning the game 17–0 in College Station, Texas, the Razorbacks went on to an overall record of 11–0 and won the college football national championship by beating Nebraska in the Cotton Bowl Classic. The Aggies were coached (in his final season) by Hank Foldberg, and Arkansas was coached by Hall of Fame coach Frank Broyles. This game marked the beginning of a streak of three straight scoreless games in the series for the Aggies. = 1975 – First Ranked Matchup = Arkansas 31 – Texas A&M; 6 In 1975, Texas A&M; was undefeated and ranked #2 in the nation coming into the regular season finale at #18 Arkansas. The game was played in Little Rock at War Memorial Stadium in front of a national audience, broadcast on ABC. If the Aggies won, they would clinch the Southwest Conference championship outright, and would have a chance to win a national championship in the 1976 Cotton Bowl Classic. But it wasn't to be, as the Razorbacks soundly defeated Texas A&M; 31-6, forcing a three-way tie for the SWC crown between Arkansas, Texas, and Texas A&M;, sending the Razorbacks to the Cotton Bowl. Arkansas would beat Georgia in the Cotton Bowl Classic, 31-10, finishing the season 10-2. Meanwhile, the Aggies would stumble in a Liberty Bowl loss to USC, 20-0. = 1980 = Arkansas 27 – Texas A&M; 24 The 1980 contest won by Arkansas 27–24 was Texas A&M;'s 800th game ever played by the organization. Arkansas was led by head coach Lou Holtz in his fourth year with the team, and went on to an overall record of 7–5 (3–5 in conference) for the season. The Aggies were led by Tom Wilson in his next to last season with the team, and finished the year 4–7 (3–5 in conference). = 1986 = Arkansas 14 – Texas A&M; 10 In 1986, the #7 Aggies were the defending Southwest Conference champions when they rolled into Little Rock to face #17 Arkansas in front of a sell out crowd at War Memorial Stadium. The Razorbacks would jump out to an early 7-0 lead, but Texas A&M; would tie the game with a touchdown of their own, and the teams would be tied at halftime, 7-7, due to a missed A&M; field goal. Arkansas would take back the lead in the 3rd quarter on a Greg Thomas touchdown run. The Razorback defense played great all game long, holding the Aggies to a field goal in the second half. On fourth down from inside the Arkansas fifteen yard line, Arkansas's defense tipped away an Aggie pass into the end zone in the closing seconds of the game, securing the victory for the Razorbacks. Both teams would finish the season 9-3 after bowl losses. = 1991 – Arkansas's last game in the Southwest Conference = Texas A&M; 13 – Arkansas 3 In the last Southwest Conference meeting on November 16, 1991, at Kyle Field, Texas A&M; won 13–3 in a game nationally televised by ESPN. The Razorbacks came out in the wishbone formation on offense, but the Aggie defense held the Hogs to only 121 yards of total offense. After the season, the Razorbacks went on to leave the Southwest Conference, and join the Southeastern Conference, thereby ending the yearly in-conference game with the Aggies.

Arkansas came back from a 10–0 deficit in the first quarter to win 47–19. = 2011 – \\"Welcome to the SEC\\" = Arkansas 42 – Texas A&M; 38 The Aggies, leading 35–17 at the half, blew their 18-point lead and only scored 3 points in the second half. As Broderick Green charged into the end zone on the final score of the game, Arkansas fans appeared on the Cowboys Stadium video holding a sign saying \\"Welcome to the SEC\\" (in recognition of A&M;'s announcement only six days earlier that it would join Arkansas as a member of the SEC in 2012). = 2012 – First all-SEC game = Tyler Wilson leads the Arkansas offense in the 2012 game which A&M; won 58-10. Texas A&M; 58 – Arkansas 10 On September 29, 2012, the Aggies and Razorbacks met on the gridiron as conference rivals for the first time since 1991, with A&M; joining Arkansas in the Southeastern Conference. The Aggies won 58–10. The game moved from the neutral-site Cowboys Stadium venue of the last three years to Kyle Field as part of a planned home-and-home series with Arkansas for A&M;'s first two SEC seasons; the 2014 matchup returned to AT&T; Stadium. = 2014, '15 & '17 – 3 OT Games in 4 Years = The 2014 contest returned to AT&T; Stadium (home of the Dallas Cowboys) after a two-year \\"home-and-home\\" schedule the previous two seasons. Both the 2014 and 2015 contests went into overtime. These back-to-back years of overtime were also the first two overtimes between the two schools in the rivalry's history, after overtime was adopted by the NCAA for all games beginning with the bowl games following the 1995 regular season. The 2017 matchup also ended in overtime, with the two teams combining for a series record 93 points.

Phull served as Chief of the General Staff of King Frederick William III of Prussia in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. While in Russian service, he successfully advocated for a scorched earth policy during Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Family Phull was born in Ludwigsburg to the Württemberg-line of the Pfuel family of Brandenburg. He was the son of the Swabian general Carl Ludwig Wilhelm August von Phull (1723–1793) and Auguste Wilhelmine von Keßlau (1734–1768). Phull's first marriage was in Potsdam on 2 May 1790 to Henriette Luise Charlotte von Beguelin (1763–1810), but they divorced in 1800. They had one daughter, Emilie Hernriette (1792–1864). Phull remarried on 18 September 1801 to Charlotte Poths (1766–1808), but this second marriage ended in 1803. Phull and Poths had one son, Eugen (1801–1857). Phull married for a third time in Berlin on 4 October 1810 to Sabine Henriette von Wedel (ca. 1773–1840), but this marriage also ended in separation. Career Phull entered the Prussian Army in 1777, serving near King Frederick II and becoming a member of the Prussian General Staff in 1781. Having participated in the Rhine campaign of 1793 in the First Coalition, he was promoted to Oberst in 1798 and Generalmajor in 1805. As the Departementschef of the General Staff since 1804, he was Frederick William III's chief of staff during the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in 1806. As a result of the Prussian collapse in the Fourth Coalition, Frederick William sent Phull to serve Tsar Alexander I of Russia. Phull won the confidence of the Russian emperor, was promoted to Generalmajor in the Russian Army, and instructed Alexander in military strategy. It is disputed how involved Phull was in the Russian decision to engage in a scorched earth policy against Napoleon Bonaparte during his invasion of Russia. After Napoleon took Moscow on 14 September 1812, Phull was opposed by Russian officers and forced to flee through Sweden to England. In a letter to Phull written on 12 December 1813, Alexander wrote, „C’est Vous qui avez conçu le plan qui, avec l’aide de la providence, a eu pour suite le salut de la Russie et celui de l’Europe.“ (\\"It is you who conceived the plan which, with the help of the Providence, had as a result the salvation of Russia and that of Europe\\").ADB, page 93 In 1813 Phull instructed Prince Frederik of the Netherlands in The Hague. After the fall of Paris in 1814, Phull was named Russian ambassador in The Hague and Brussels; his witty third wife, Sabine Henriette von Wedel, headed a popular household in Brussels. After Wedel became emotionally unstable, Phull retired to Stuttgart in 1821, where he died five years later. Phull's involvement with the Russian campaign in 1812 is included in Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, in which the general is known as Pfuel. Notes References *Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB).

Although the University and the closely affiliated University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) are tightly intertwined both institutionally and geographically, including the sharing and leasing arrangements of resources and facilities (such as Forbes Tower, Thomas Detre Hall, the Carrillo Street Steam Plant, Hillman Cancer Center, etc), buildings primarily owned by UPMC are listed separately because the University and UPMC are technically separate legal entities. University of Pittsburgh The major concentration of buildings that comprise Pitt's main campus is centered in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, however a few facilities are scattered elsewhere throughout the city, including the adjacent Shadyside neighborhood. Along with regional campuses in Bradford, Greensburg, Johnstown, and Titusville, Pitt also has a Computer Center in RIDC Park in Blawnox, the Plum Boro Science Center in Plum, the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center (U-PARC) in Harmarville, Pennsylvania, the Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology in Linesville, Pennsylvania, and the Allen L.

The name is a portmanteau of Crescent Lake and Nessie, the nickname given to the Loch Ness Monster. The monster has been described as resembling a large dark brown eel around 15 feet in length with a long, sleek body and as \\"looking long and shiny, and having a fish-like head.\\" Claims of Cressie being sighted began in the 1950s, and continue to the present day. History Though there are reported sightings of Cressie as early as the 1950s, some have linked the legends to earlier Indigenous legends of the woodum haoot (\\"pond devil\\") or haoot tuwedyee (\\"swimming demon\\"), however others caution that this attribution has seemingly been copied from source to source without any verification of its connection to Cressie or the area of Newfoundland and Labrador in which Cressie is found. There have been no photographs of Cressie, and all information relies on local oral history. According to local folklore, an elderly resident of Robert's Arm known as Grandmother Anthony was startled while berry-picking by a giant serpent in the lake. In one of the earliest dated sightings in the 1950s, two woodsmen were on the shores of the lake when they noticed an upturned boat, and fearing for its occupants, they hurried towards it. However, as they approached, the boat turned out to be something large and slick which slipped below the waters of the lake. A local resident reported a slim, black shape rise five feet from a patch of churning water before sinking out of sight, in early spring 1990. On July 9, 1991, Fred Parsons and his wife reported seeing a large snakelike creature swimming in Crescent Lake. He described it as a long, sleek body without a significantly large head, which was laying level with the water. In September of that same year, a resident of Robert's Arm was returning to town when he noticed a disturbance on the surface of the lake. As he watched, the object dropped beneath the surface and then rose again. He described it as \\"a black, fifteen foot long shape pitching forward in a rolling motion much as a whale does but with no sign of a fin.\\" It sank out of sight and did not reappear. There were several sightings in 1995, and a summer student crew working on the boardwalk along the lake spotted the monster in 2000. During the summer of 2003, several town residents say they saw the creature swimming after at least a year with no reports, which had led some residents to speculate whether Cressie had died. In these reports, Cressie was said to resemble a snake-like creature with a fish-like head: > A passenger in a passing car shrieked at the driver as she looked out > towards the lake and watched as the monster surfaced, its skin shiny and > slick under the summer sun. Both watched water pour from the monster's > gaping mouth. It was about 20 feet in length and swam silently across the > top of the lake before diving down into the cool depths once more. There are other reports that divers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have allegedly described seeing \\"giant eels as thick as a man's thigh\\" in the lake while investigating a drowning death. According to reports, scuba divers conducting an underwater search for the body of a downed pilot in the mid-80s found themselves surrounded by a school of vicious gigantic eels, though they were able to escape, leading some to believe that perhaps these eels were Cressie's babies. In the winter, large holes often appear in the ice that covers Crescent Lake, leading some to speculate that the holes were created not by something falling into the lake, but by something bursting through the ice. Explanations According to skeptics there are several natural occurrences that can explain \\"Cressie\\" sightings.Giant eels have been touted as one of the most likely candidates. Several Robert's Arm residents offer as evidence of the eel hypothesis previous sightings of giant eels, and high numbers of eels appearing in eel traps in the lake. In an article from 1993 called Have You Seen Cressie?, author R.A. Bragg suggests that eels do not stop growing during their lifetime, and perhaps this is the cause of Cressie's size. Others, such as skeptical investigator Joe Nickell speculate that perhaps the dark-colored northern river otter is responsible. He claims the river otter > \\"swims both under water and at the surface where its wake can make it appear > much longer, and moves in an undulating (rising and falling) manner...In > addition, multiple otters swimming in a line can give the effect of a single > giant serpentine creature slithering with an up-and-down movement through > water\\". Still others suggest that Cressie is not a living creature at all, but instead a large log. The bottom of Crescent Lake is reported to be covered in wooden logs from when logging took place in the community. For decades, Crescent Lake was used to transport more than half a million cords of pulpwood that was harvested from the surrounding areas and shipped to paper mills. Some speculate that bubbles of gas from the decomposing wood lifts these logs to the surface of the lake. Tourism and Popular Culture The statue of Cressie, on the shores of Crescent Lake, Robert's Arm, Newfoundland. It is at least the second such statue placed in this location. In 1991, the town of Robert's Arm erected a statue of Cressie at the entrance to the community, along with a storyboard which describes the alleged sightings. This statue greets tourists to the area, and is depicted with distinctly dragonlike features including green scales, a row of plates along its back, and fearsome teeth. The statue and signs have been part of a deliberate attempt by the community to promote the monster in hopes of boosting tourism and the local economy: > In 1992 Roberts Arm was the principal supply and service centre for > communities on several nearby islands. However, the town's major source of > employment — cutting pulpwood for local contractors — was in crisis, after > having been in decline for some years. It was also hoped that the community > would benefit from efforts to promote tourism along the \\"Beothuk Trail\\". > Perhaps this hope is strengthened by the old, local tradition that a > 'monster', named Cressie, inhabits Crescent Lake. A local gas station is named \\"Cressie's Gas Bar & Supplies.\\" A 2012 newspaper article promoting local hiking spots used the monster as a potential attraction for hikers: > The area is blazing with color in the fall when the birches, aspens and > maples are changing colour. If you are lucky maybe you will even catch a > glimpse of 'cressie', the lake monster that lurks beneath the waters of > Crescent Lake. Cressie has featured in several of Robert's Arm's Come Home Year celebrations. The 1995 Come Home Year commemorative book includes several poems which refer to Cressie, including this passage by Jim Payne: > \\"I suppose you've heard of Cressie the monster in the lake If you get too > handy she'll give her tail a shake She'll set you boat a-rocking and you > won't believe your eyes And people will make fun of you and say you're > telling lies\\" In May 2008, local media reported that a production company from Montreal would travel to Robert's Arm to produce a show for the History Channel. On 17 September 2008, History Channel’s Monster Quest broadcast an episode entitled “Lake Monsters of the North,” which focused on the legends of the monster eels in the lake. In October 2019, a group exhibition entitled “Crafted Beasts” opened at the Craft Council of NL Gallery in St. John's, which examined provincial, indigenous, and Western European folklore, and which \\"started from the desire to see the transformation of traditional beliefs, customs and stories that have been passed through word of mouth, into a physical object.\\" The show included a sculpture inspired by tales of the lake monster: > For “Cressie,” Michael Harlick combined forged metal and found bone to build > a spooky sculpture one certainly would not want to encounter in the deep, > dark waters.

The company holds oil and natural gas property interest in the United States and in western Canada, in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan. The company is based out of Calgary, Alberta and trades on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. It was Canada's first income trust.  History  Enerplus was established in 1986 by Marcel Tremblay, a pension fund manager and John Brussa, a lawyer. It was originally called Enerplus Resources Fund, and it was Canada's first income trust. Its original purpose was to provide income from mature, aging oil and gas assets to retail investors, taking advantage of the tax advantages of the income trust structure. It started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1986 with a $10 million IPO. In 1996, Mark Resources renamed itself Enermark, became an income trust, and joined the Enerplus group of companies. This was at the behest of Enerplus's then-CEO, Marcel Tremblay, in response to a hostile take-over attempt. In 2000, Enerplus merged with the Westrock Funds. In 2001, Enermark was merged into Enerplus. In 2004, it bought some of ChevronTexaco's western Canadian assets for $467 million. In 2005, Enerplus acquired American energy company Lyco Energy for $500 million, as part of an expansion strategy into the United States. Lyco held assets in South Dakota and Montana. This was the largest American acquisition by a Canadian oil and gas income trust to that time. In 2008, Enerplus acquired Focus Energy Trust for $1.4 billion in stock. Focus unit-holders ended up owning 20% of the merged entity. Focus primarily specialized in natural gas production. In 2010, Enerplus sold their Kirby oilsands leases for $400 million, as a move of the company away from the oilsands. Around the same time, the company bought several properties in the Bakken formation in North Dakota for US$456 million. Enerplus Corporation converted from an income trust to a corporate entity on January 1, 2011, after receiving approval by 98.5% of unitholders. This was done because of changes in the taxation rules for income trusts. In 2016, Enerplus sold its Alberta natural gas properties for $193 million.  Operations  As of 2015, Enerplus produced 110,800 barrels per day, 55% from natural gas, and 45% from crude oil and other liquids. 75% of production in the United States, and 25% is in Canada. It has three main areas of operation: * The Williston basin: The company produces crude oil from properties in the Fort Berthold area of North Dakota. As of 2017, production was 30,000 barrels per day. * The Marcellus region in Pennsylvania, where the company has shale gas assets, with a 2017 production of around per day * Southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, with 2016 crude oil production of 10,000 barrels per day See also * Petroleum industry in Canada * Canadian petroleum companies References External links * Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange Category:Energy companies of Canada Category:Companies based in Calgary Category:Non-renewable resource companies established in 1986 Category:Oil companies of Canada Category:1986 establishments in Canada ","title":"Enerplus"},{"id":"17335178","text":"Jahnsfelde manor-house Tüßling castle, Bavaria, photographed, as inhabited by the Counts Bruges-von Pfuel today The German ancient noble family of Pfuel (also Pfuhl or Phull) arrived in Brandenburg in the year 926 and later widened their influence to Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Mecklenburg, Pomerania, Württemberg, Westphalia, Eastern Europe and Sweden.

In 1987, at the age of twenty-six, he won the Polyglot of Flanders/Babel Prize, after demonstrating communicative competence in nineteen languages (Arabic, Azerbaijani, Bashkir, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Kyrgyz, Persian, Russian, Swahili, Tajik, Tatar, Turkish, Turkmen, Tuvan, Uyghur, and Uzbek). Seven old languages that he had studied (such as Latin and Old Church Slavonic) were not tested, and he has since gone on to study many more languages. In 1993, together with his wife, Linda Gezels, he founded Orientaal vzw, a centre dedicated to the teaching of Oriental languages and cultures.

She was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, representing Bayswater for the Liberal Party from 2006 to 2018. Early life Victoria was born in Melbourne to an Austrian father and a New Zealand mother. She completed her HSC in 1984, and went on to complete her BA in Fine Art Photography in 1988 at the Phillip Institute of Technology (now part of RMIT University). Prior to her election, Victoria owned and operated her own photography business, specialising in portraits and event photography. Political career Within the Liberal Party, Victoria has served as branch president, vice-president and secretary; state and federal electorate council delegate; fundraiser; branch development officer; and State council and Federal conference delegate. She was elected to the seat of Bayswater at the November 2006 election. In November 2009, she was named Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Arts, following her strong involvement in the campaign to prevent the proposed changes to the Victorian College of the Arts. After Ted Baillieu resigned as Premier in March 2013, Victoria was given the ministerial portfolios of Arts, Women's Affairs and Consumer Affairs within the Denis Napthine cabinet. Controversies In July 2009, Victoria was forced to apologise for using unparliamentary language during a late night parliamentary debate. In the incident, Victoria allegedly swore at a Labor counterpart MP Danielle Green . MP Danielle Green was quoted saying ‘‘The member for Bayswater has just used words which started with ‘f’ in referring to me,’’ Hansard records Ms Green stating. ‘‘And I ask her to withdraw, because it is very unparliamentary and I take personal offence that any member in this chamber would be so undisciplined as to use words like that.’’ During the Victorian State Election of 2014, a long running road safety sign in the suburb of Wantirna was replaced with an election campaign advertisement for Heidi Victoria. When questioned by Fairfax Media, Victoria responded \\" A legal contract has been broken with me, and I am in the process of pursuing through legal channels.\\" In early November 2014, multiple election campaign signs for Heidi Victoria were defaced with swastikas and offensive language throughout the Heathmont and Bayswater area.

It was written by Chuck Lorre and Lee Aronsohn in a crossover between CSI and Two and a Half Men. The character of Annabelle is based on Roseanne Barr, who Lorre believed behaved poorly while he was running her eponymous blockbuster TV show; the title font for the show-within-a-show \\"Annabelle\\" is even identical to the one used for Roseanne. Lorre was the original producer for that show until he was pushed out. Plot When the death of a well-known TV star, Annabelle (Katey Sagal), is reported, the CSI team is sent to investigate. Annabelle's co-star, Megan, is interviewed, saying what a tragedy it was. Warrick points out to Grissom and Catherine that a woman's high heel print can clearly be seen in the blood from Annabelle's room. When Grissom gets a phone call that something has turned up on the television set, he heads to Los Angeles. When Grissom arrives, he finds Natasha (Annabelle's stand-in/double), dead from a car accident. Minutes later, Megan screams out as her dog lies dead in front of her. Back in Vegas, Hodges shows Catherine footage of Bud Parker (Annabelle's driver and now the show's \\"executive producer\\") marrying Annabelle, that is actually Natasha. Grissom and Brass search Bud's office and find alcohol, which he has been giving to Annabelle. They also let him know that semen was found on Natasha before she died, trying to pin her murder on him. Bud does not answer any questions, but instead is led away by police until he is ready to talk. Catherine finds out that a writer visited Annabelle's room and had the same water bottle on him that she found at the scene of the crime. That writer has not been seen since the show filmed in Vegas. The bottle is dusted for prints and the CSI team come up with the name Richard Langford, an actor and street performer. As the team hands out pictures on the street to find him, Richard is performing on the street as a robot and tries to get away. Warrick and Nick arrest him. Nick interviews Richard, who says that he was going to become a regular on her sitcom but was dismissed when he refused to sleep with Annabelle. He went to Vegas to get a second chance and decided to sleep with her after all. She fell backwards, hit her head, and died, which was an accident, according to him. He says that the rubber chicken stuffed down her throat was not an accident, but intentional since she was already dead. The corpse of Annabelle tests positive for blood thinners, and the team realizes that she had been poisoned for quite some time prior to her death. The same drug is found in Natasha's blood. Grissom and Brass figure out that the only other person, besides Bud, who knew about Annabelle hiding her alcohol in mouthwash bottles was Megan. She confesses hypothetically by placing her actions on a fictional character in a script. In it, she reveals that she had had help from an Italian uncle, \\"Giuseppe,\\" who taught her how to sabotage Annabelle's car in exchange for what she called \\"unsavory favors.\\" She later asserts that there is only circumstantial evidence implicating her, and reveals that she has a new TV series called \\"Megan's Family.\\" She then introduces her lover/executive producer, one of the show producers, who was constantly humiliated by Annabelle and Bud, who appears on cue. So with no proof, they do not arrest her. While shaving, Bud cuts himself and bleeds profusely from the neck as the screen cuts to black. Connections with Two and a Half Men * As Grissom and Brass are driven through a studio backlot to a crime scene, they spot Charlie Sheen (smoking a cigarette), Jon Cryer (smoking a tobacco pipe) and Angus T. Jones (biting the end off a cigar) outside a trailer wearing the same clothes from \\"Fish in a Drawer\\". All were stars of the CBS series Two and a Half Men at the time of the episode's production, making uncredited cameo appearances. * The character of Don (one of the writers of the \\"Annabelle\\" show) is played by Kevin Sussman who plays the character of Stuart, owner of the comic book store frequently featured on The Big Bang Theory, another Chuck Lorre show. In a discussion about writing he asks the other writers if any of them has ever contacted Two and a Half Men. Another writer answers \\"Ecch! I'd rather sleep with Annabelle than write that crap!\\" * The title of this episode is a parody of the Two and a Half Men name whose creators, Chuck Lorre and Lee Aronsohn, wrote this episode. * To reciprocate, the writers of CSI wrote a Two and a Half Men episode, \\"Fish in a Drawer\\", which aired on CBS on May 5, 2008. * J. D. Walsh also appears as another of the writers of the \\"Annabelle\\" show. In Two and a Half Men he stars as Gordon, a pizza delivery guy who appears in seasons 1–3 and season 6 onwards.

Cummins House is a historic house in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, United States, a suburb southwest of Minneapolis. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Cummins and his wife, Martha \\"Mattie\\" Cummins, established a farmstead on the property in 1856. They built the house in 1879-1880 and lived there until 1908. Cummins was a horticulturist who helped to establish the Minnesota Horticultural Society. During his horticultural experiments, Cummins corresponded with other horticulturalists in the area, including Peter Gideon, Jonathan Taylor Grimes, Henry Lyman, William Macintosh, E.R. Pond, and others. Cummins primarily grew wheat as a farm crop.Sign posted on site by the City of Eden Prairie In 1908, Edwin and Harriet Sprague Phipps bought the farm and lived there until 1934. The Phipps family raised grain, vegetables, and flowers, and Edwin earned the title \\"Asparagus King of Hennepin County\\" for the vegetables he sold at a stand on nearby U.S. Route 212 (Flying Cloud Drive). Harriet Phipps planted a large bed of peonies in about 1920. The peony bed exists to this day. Her daughter, Mildred Grill, remarked, \\"The peony bed has been there for over 60 years. Mother put in 500 plants. There wasn't another bed like it in the county. She sold flowers in season.\\" Their son-in-law and daughter, Martin and Mildred Grill, owned the house from 1934 through 1976. Martin, nicknamed \\"Pappy\\", built an airplane landing strip on the property in 1937. In 1941, the United States Navy arranged to use the landing strip for student pilots from Wold- Chamberlain Airport (now Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport) to make practice approaches. After World War II was over, Grill sold the landing strip and some additional land to American Aviation, Inc. The field is now known as Flying Cloud Airport. The Grill family sold the house and surrounding farmland to the city of Eden Prairie in 1976 for parkland. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The house itself has elements of the Greek Revival style, in the wide trim on the gable end, and elements of the Italianate style with the use of brick and the segmental arches over the windows. It has a gable front with a wing on the west side, along with an L-shaped front porch. The main floor contains a parlor, a bedroom, a bathroom, the living room, and the kitchen. The second floor contains four bedrooms. In addition to the main house, there are four wooden outbuildings and a milk house on the property. In 2010 the farmstead was transferred to the Eden Prairie Historical Society and is available as a rental event facility.

Officially established in 1927, BCT has been putting on a full season of plays and musicals starting when Albert Johnson directed the beginning of a continuous string of productions. The theatre has been remodeled a few times, and is currently capable of holding an audience of 181. History Bakersfield Community Theatre was founded in May 1927. Prior to this date, community theatre productions were frequently produced in Bakersfield by various clubs. The Bakersfield Woman's Club presented theatre productions, as well as the Elks, DeMolay, and the Plymouth Guild. Albert Johnson worked to make community theatre part of Bakersfield culture. In November 1926 Gilmor Brown of the Pasadena Playhouse gave a speech before the Bakersfield Woman's Club outlining possible procedures for organizing a local community theatre. \\"Call a mass meeting,\\" he advised. \\"Do not depend too much on the names always associated with important community activities. Sincere workers and promising talent will be found in unexpected places if the proposition is presented as a real community project.\\" In early May 1927, a group of women met one night at the Woman's Club building to found a community theatre. They included Alma Campbell, Ethel Robinson, Mrs. George Shearer, and Helen T. Peairs. Using telephones and the newspaper, they announced a public meeting to be held a few days later on May 16, 1927 at the clubhouse. More than fifty people attended and the founding group expanded to include Mrs. Ross C. Miller, Evelyn Derby, Dwight Clark, Thomas McManus and Laurence Taylor. Ten days later the founders had finished writing the constitution and bylaws and had taken on 98 paid season members. The name Bakersfield Community Theatre (BCT) was adopted. Another public meeting was called on May 31, 1927 at the courthouse for election of board members and officers. Paid membership had grown to 125 members. By the end of the evening the new community theatre was underway and committee chairmen had received their assignments. The total time to found the theatre was a little over two weeks. On October 31, 1927 the first BCT production was presented: The First Year by Frank Craven, performed at Bakersfield High School's auditorium before an audience of more than 400 people. Alma Campbell directed the production. Four productions were presented each season for the first nine years. For many years there was only one performance given for each production. The number of performances for each production has gradually increased, going from one a year to four by the mid-1950s. Currently, the typical adult production at BCT, whether musical or not, has six full=length productions, plus their Annual One-Act Festival every August. =Mid-20th century= Commencing with the 1936-1937 season, five productions were presented. With few exceptions, each season since has been made up of, at least, five shows. Since the theatre did not have a playhouse to call home, between 1927 and 1961 the productions were presented in the auditoriums at Washington Junior High School (which is now the administration building for Bakersfield City School District), Standard Junior High School, Golden State Junior High School (now the Blair Learning Center), and the old auditorium at Bakersfield High School. In April 1961, BCT opened the new playhouse with a production of For The Love Of Maggie, written by Barbara Gardener and Ann Agabashian (both of Bakersfield) and directed by Howard Miller. This production was presented between the 4th and 5th productions of the 1960-1961 season. The playhouse (located at 2400 South Chester Avenue) has been the location for all productions presented since April 1961 with the exception of two presented at the Bakersfield College Indoor Theatre in 1968 and 1983. In the summer of 1976, remodeling of the playhouse began under the supervision of Roger Benischek, and the approval of the Board of Directors of BCT, with Richard ‘Stubby” Newman, the President at that time. The design to give the theatre a new look was drafted by Joseph Licastro. The first remodeling was of the auditorium interior, completed just prior to the opening night of “Play It Again, Sam” The ticket office was revamped to include an office, ticket counter, and a lounge with posters on the walls of past productions. The front of the theatre was refurbished in the summer of 1980. New features included a brick patio with plants and a metal sculpture (created by Frank Wattron), a lawn with a high white stucco wall, a ramp and deck overlooking the patio, a new light booth, two small lobbies and a white electric sign with \\"Bakersfield Community Theatre\\" in blue lettering on it. All of these features were completed a few hours prior to the opening of Side by Side by Sondheim in September 1980. Since then a rehearsal hall and workshop has been added to the back of the theatre. The most recent remodeling was done in the summer of 1983 when the auditorium seats were replaced with 181 new ones. The interior was again remodeled to match the decor of the seats. =Present day= Bakersfield Community Theatre continues to present five main productions (as well as an annual one act festival and numerous youth theatre shows) each theatre season. The theatre has staged seasons uninterrupted since 1927.

The New Croton Aqueduct is an aqueduct in the New York City water supply system in Westchester County, New York carrying the water of the Croton Watershed. Built roughly parallel to the Old Croton Aqueduct it originally augmented, it opened in 1910. The old aqueduct remained in service until 1955, when supply from the Delaware and Catskill Aqueducts was sufficient to take it off line. Waters of the New Croton Aqueduct flow to the Jerome Park Reservoir in the Bronx before entering Croton Water Filtration Plant in Van Cortlandt Park for treatment, then out to distribution. History The Croton Watershed is one of three systems that provide water to New York City, joined by the waters of the Delaware and Catskill Aqueducts. Stone building in Yonkers for shaft of New Croton Aqueduct The New Croton Aqueduct opened on July 15, 1890, replacing the Old Croton Aqueduct. It runs from the New Croton Reservoir in Westchester County to the Jerome Park Reservoir in the Bronx. Water flows then proceed toward the Croton Water Filtration Plant for treatment. Treated water is then distributed to certain areas of the Bronx and Manhattan. In the late 1990s, New York City stopped using water from the Croton due to numerous water quality issues. In 2004, a project was started to rehabilitate the New Croton Aqueduct and build a filtration plant, the Croton Water Filtration Plant in Van Cortlandt Park, which was activated in May 2015.https://csengineermag.com/nyc-dep-activates-croton-water-filtration- plant/ Because of these quality problems, the Croton system is bypassed or mixed with water from the Catskill Aqueduct and/or Delaware Aqueduct during times of drought.

In August 1910 he discovered one of the highest peaks in the Pamir Mountains, which he named Peak Korzhenevskaya after his wife Evgeniya Korzhenevskaya ().

Members of the band include Jesse Barnett (vocals), Andrew Rose (bass), George Schmitz (drums), Chris Rawson and Josh James (guitars). They are currently signed with Pure Noise Records. History =Early years, For What It's Worth, and Comes From the Heart (2003–2008)= Frontman Jesse Barnett formed the band by recruiting Casey Lagos (whom he knew from his days on the worship team for Saddleback Church) on drums. After composing a few songs together, the two enlisted Justin Rutherford and Curtis Pleshe on guitars and Noah Calvin on bass. Their style made an impression locally, leading to the release of their first EP, Compassion without Compromise, in 2004. The band travelled to Oakland, California to debut their first studio album For What It's Worth, later released on This City Is Burning Records. The album includes one of their best known songs, \\"This Is More\\", and its release launched them to wider prominence, while the members were still in high school. Upon graduation, they went on tour throughout the United States. On 2007, Century Media Records signed the band and re-released their debut album with two bonus tracks. After several line-up changes, the band started recording their second full-length album with only two members, Jesse Barnett and Casey Lagos. Marking a significant change in Barnett's vocal style, Comes from the Heart was released in 2008 through Century Media. That year, the band was part of Warped Tour, Hell on Earth and numerous other tours. While they were supporting Every Time I Die's tour in November 2008, Casey Lagos decided to quit the band to pursue his own musical career. =Signing with Sumerian Records and The Hope Division (2008–2011)= Ash Avildsen of Sumerian Records signed the band after seeing them at the Anaheim House of Blues. In 2010 the band began working on their third full-length with a stable line-up consisting of Jesse Barnett on vocals, George Schmitz on drums, Chris Rawson and Reid Haymond on guitars and Andrew Rose on bass. The Hope Division was released on June 1 meeting critical acclaim and leading them to mainstream success. On November 2011, Stick to Your Guns posted a picture on their Facebook of a 20-year-old Arizona fan, Samuel Perkins, after several of his friends got tattoos of the heart which features on the cover of The Hope Division as a tribute to their friend. Along with the tattoo are the words \\"At least he died a lion.\\" This was due to his long and painful battle with a brain tumor that he fought against; his friends called him the best person they have ever met. Stick to Your Guns saw the unity in their actions and decided to pay tribute to him by performing as the headliner at Sam's memorial show. =Diamond and Disobedient (2011–2016)= Stick to Your Guns performing at Impericon Festival 2015 In 2011, a stand-alone single titled \\"Bringing You Down (A New World Overthrow)\\" and featuring guest vocals of Karl Schwartz from First Blood, was released in support of the Occupy Wall Street movement. This song was an early version of a single from their fourth album, Diamond, which was released in 2012 with Josh James (of Evergreen Terrace) replacing Reid Haymond on guitar. The genre-bending album debuted on the Billboard charts making it to #1 on the Heatseekers chart, #11 for Hard Rock Albums, #30 for Rock Albums and placed on the Billboard 200. Later that year, Josh James confirmed that he left Evergreen Terrace to become a permanent member of the band. The band released several single to promote the album. One of the singles, \\"We Still Believe\\", went on to gain consistent radio play. The album scored the band a spot on the 2013 Warped Tour. While on the Warped Tour, it was announced that “Diamond” won an Independent Music Award for best Hardcore/Metal Album of the year. In 2013, Pure Noise Records released a split EP which contained two songs from the band and two from The Story So Far. The EP featured their single \\"We Still Believe\\" and a cover of Inside Out's \\"Burning Fight\\". On 2014, they released Diamond: Decade Edition, a vinyl re-release of Diamond which featured three bonus tracks. The band was also featured on Florence + The Sphinx: Sumerian Ceremonials, a tribute album to Florence + The Machine, covering \\"Dog Days Are Over\\". On February 5, 2014, the band entered the studio with producer John Feldmann (The Used, Story of the Year) to record their fifth studio album. Throughout the recording, the band released studio updates, confirming several guests to record vocals on the record, including: Scott Vogel of Terror, Toby Morse of H2O, Walter Delgado of Rotting Out, the members of Motionless in White and producer John Feldmann himself. Recording finished on March 12, 2014. On September 16, 2014, the band released a teaser video for their new album on their Facebook page, announcing the album's title as being Disobedient, as well as the album's release date—February 10, 2015.

It is located at Building 1, Luce Avenue, Naval Station Newport. The building is named after Rear Admiral Stephen Luce. In a Flemish style inspired by the town hall and guild halls on the Grote Markt in Antwerp, Belgium, local Newport architects George C. Mason & Son designed the building for the Navy with gables facing Narragansett Bay. It was completed on 22 May 1892 at the cost of $82,875, with the remainder of the $100,000 Congressional appropriation being spent on heating and equipment. The building was originally designed to have four sets of officers' quarters, one in each corner of the building, with the College classrooms, library, and administration located in the center section. This usage remained until 1914, when the entire building was opened for official uses. The building was the main administrative building for the Naval War College from 1892, when Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan was President of the Naval War College for his second time, until 1974 during the presidency of Vice Admiral Stansfield Turner, when the president's office was moved to newly constructed Conolly Hall. The building was designated part of a National Historic Landmark District, along with the building that is now the Naval War College Museum (which housed the college's first facilities but was built in 1819 to house Newport's poor), in 1964.

DR is notable in the history of role-playing games for being one of the first RPGs to be released under an open source (or open gaming) licence, known as the Dominion Rules Licence.John Munsch, \\"Making Sure An Open Source RPG Stays Available\\": Development of the game followed an open source model whereby contributors, known as the Dominion Games Development Team,See \\"The Dominion Games Interview\\" (November 2000) at http://www.guildcompanion.com/scrolls/2000/nov/dginterview.html made improvements or additions to the game and published them on the internet (often through the Dominion Games web site) under the terms of the Dominion Rules Licence, thus explicitly encouraging the creation of new skills, spells, beasts and rules by its modular structure in an attempt to establish an equivalent to the Open Source Software model in RPG gaming.  Game Mechanic DR is a skills-based role-playing game system based on the twelve-sided die (d12). The game mechanic is the same for almost all actions: players roll d12 trying to roll less than or equal to the applicable skill stat, as modified by any applicable bonuses or penalties. For example, a character seeking to strike an opponent with his weapon begins with his Strike stat, adds to it the Strike bonus applicable to his weapon, and subtracts from that any defensive penalties imposed by his opponent's defensive manoeuvres and armour. A roll of 12 always fails. In many cases, a roll of 12 has particularly negative results. DR is designed around three major skill types, namely combat skills, priestcraft skills and witchcraft skills. All characters have access to combat skills. Priest-style characters have access to priest-specific skills such as bless, consecrate, curse, defile, heal, smite, wrath, and work miracle. Magic- using characters may either cast pre-made spells or employ free-form magic, both of which are essentially another type of skill use.  Game Setting The DR rules system is intended to be generic and does not describe the kind of world (or \\"campaign setting\\") to which they apply. The system can be used in a variety of RPG settings by excluding or modifying certain rules. For a historical setting, players simply disregard the priestcraft and witchcraft rules.  Distribution Dominion Rules was one of the first RPGs to be released under an open source style (or open gaming style) licence, known as the Dominion Rules Licence. The current version of DR is distributed under version 2.0 of the Dominion Rules Licence. The current version of DR is free to download from http://www.dominionrules.org. Copies of the previous versions can be found in various places on the internet.  History  DR 1.0 appeared in 1999.

Sidney Island is a part of the Capital Regional District, while its land titles are legally described in the Cowichan Land District. In 1859 Captain Richards named the island for Frederick W. Sidney, who, like Richards served in the survey branch of the Royal Navy. Gulf Islands National Park Reserve The northern end of the island (including Sidney Spit, a sandspit) is part of the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve. It was formerly the Sidney Spit Marine Park under provincial jurisdiction. Sidney Spit is accessible by kayak, canoe or boat. There are 21 mooring buoys, and dock space is available to boaters on the government dock. Sidney Spit is also accessible by the privately operated walk-on passenger ferry that runs between the Sidney Pier (in Sidney) and Sidney Spit during the summer months. Sidney Spit is known for its sandy beaches and backcountry camping. There are 26 walk-in, backcountry camp sites available at Sidney Spit, and facilities include pit toilets, picnic tables and potable water. Due to the high sodium content in the potable water at Sidney Spit, it should not be consumed by those with heart or kidney ailments, and is extremely undesirable for anyone to consume, as it bears an extremely saline and slightly moldy taste. It is recommended that visitors bring their own water. Campfires are not permitted.

However, it received condemnation from human rights organizations for its restrictions on freedom of speech and organization, potentially placing Nigeria at odds with several international agreements to which the country is signatory; it was also seen in Nigeria as being a last-ditch election-year effort of the Obasanjo administration to appeal to public sentiment, since the second reading of the bill was being pushed after the Senate's defeat of a bill to amend the Constitution's limit on the number of presidential terms.

Reaction =Domestic= The overwhelming majority of Nigerians were in full support of this legislation as it reflected the desire of the people who do not see it as a fundamental human right issue.http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/06/nigerians-support-anti-same-sex-bill- poll/ Of the few dissenting voices, one of the stiffest domestic opponents of the legislation was Davis Mac-Iyalla, an homosexual Nigerian LGBT rights advocate who heads the Nigerian chapter of Changing Attitude, an Anglican pro- LGBT organization based in the United Kingdom. Mac-Iyalla, who was repeatedly arrested by Nigerian police in pro-LGBT demonstrations in previous years, was already an opponent of Peter Akinola, the current Anglican Primate of the Church of Nigeria. =International= In February 2006, the United States State Department attacked the proposal. In March 2006, 16 international human rights groups signed a letter condemning the bill, calling it a violation of the freedoms of expression, association and assembly guaranteed by international law as well as by the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and a barrier to the struggle against the spread of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. Some sources claim that Nigeria has the world's third-highest population of persons with AIDS: 3.6 million Nigerians are infected with HIV.Heidi Vogt, \\"Nigeria must withdraw anti-gay bill\\", Independent Online.

In a survey of the U.S. Pew Research Center in 2013, 98 percent of the Nigerian respondents said society should not accept homosexuality.http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on- homosexuality/ In 2018, LGBT activists who have worked extensively in the country on LGBT issues and court cases involving LGBT persons all agree that the law has never been used to convict anyone in any homosexuality-related cases. This, they believe, is because the law itself is incoherent. In addition, many cases involving suspected LGBT persons lack proper evidence and sometimes there’s no evidence at all. That makes it impossible for prosecutors to present a winnable case and prove that any crime has been committed.https://76crimes.com/2018/12/15/6-surprising-facts-about-nigerias- anti-gay-marriage-law/ See also *LGBT rights in Nigeria *Recognition of same-sex unions in Nigeria References External links * Full text of the 2006 proposal * Full text of the 2013 Act * Human Rights, Homosexuality and the Anglican Communion: Reflections in Light of Nigeria Category:LGBT rights in Nigeria Category:Nigerian law Category:2007 in Nigeria Category:2007 in law Category:2007 in LGBT history de:Homosexualität in Nigeria ","title":"Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act 2013"},{"id":"17335964","text":"A total of 12 CONCACAF teams entered the competition. , as the hosts, and , as the defending champions, qualified automatically, leaving 4 spots open for competition.

The climate of Argentina is a vastly complex subject, as the vast size of the country and wide variation in altitude make for a wide range of climate types. Summers are the warmest and wettest season in most of the country except in most of Patagonia where it is the driest season. Winters are normally mild in the north, cool in the center and cold in the southern parts experiencing frequent frost and snow. Because southern parts of the country are moderated by the surrounding oceans, the cold is less intense and prolonged than areas at similar latitudes in the northern hemisphere. Spring and autumn are transition seasons that generally feature mild weather. Many regions have different, often contrasting, microclimates. In general, northern parts of the country are characterized by hot, humid, rainy summers and mild winters with periodic droughts. Mesopotamia, in the northeast is characterized by high temperatures and abundant precipitation throughout the year with droughts being uncommon. West of this lies the Chaco region, which is the warmest region in Argentina. Precipitation in the Chaco region decreases westwards, resulting in the vegetation changing from forests in the east to shrubs in the west. Northwest Argentina is predominantly dry and hot although the rugged topography makes it climatically diverse, ranging from the cold, dry Puna to thick jungles. The center of the country, which includes the Pampas to the east and the drier Cuyo region to the west has hot summers with frequent tornadoes and thunderstorms, and cool, dry winters. Patagonia, in the southern parts of the country has a dry climate with warm summers and cold winters characterized by strong winds throughout the year and one of the strongest precipitation gradients in the world. High elevations at all latitudes experience cooler conditions, and the mountainous zones can see heavy snowfall. The geographic and geomorphic characteristics of Argentina tend to create extreme weather conditions, often leading to natural disasters that negatively impact the country both economically and socially. The Pampas, where many of the large cities are located, has a flat topography and poor water drainage, making it vulnerable to flooding. Severe storms can lead to tornadoes, damaging hail, storm surges, and high winds, causing extensive damage to houses and infrastructure, displacing thousands of people and causing significant loss of life. Extreme temperature events such as heat waves and cold waves impact rural and urban areas by negatively impacting agriculture, one of the main economic activities of the country, and by increasing energy demand, which can lead to energy shortages. Seasons In Argentina, the climate is divided into four, well defined seasons, those being winter, spring, summer and autumn. =Winter= Tierra del Fuego National Park during winter In winter (June–August), the northern parts of Argentina are generally warm, the central parts mild, and the southern parts cold with frequent frost and snow. The climate of the southern parts of the country is moderated by the surrounding oceans, resulting in cold weather that is less intense and prolonged than at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The northern parts of the country have the warmest temperatures, with an average of ; the central parts are cooler, with an average of . In the extreme south, mean temperatures are below . At higher altitudes in the Andes, average winter temperatures are below . June and July temperatures are normally similar to each other; however, in August temperatures see a rise of about . Precipitation varies a lot during the winter months. The highest are in the extreme northern part of the Littoral region and northwestern parts of Patagonia, where mean winter precipitation exceeds . Most of the humid Pampas, averages between while in the north, in areas bordering the Andes, it averages less than . winter here sucks =Spring= alt=Jacarandas in bloom at Jacarandas in bloom at Plaza Miserere, Buenos Aires Spring (September–November) is similar to autumn, with mild days and cool nights. During mid-October a large variety of wild and urban flora are in bloom. Temperatures range from in the north to in the center, and in most of Patagonia. Tierra del Fuego Province and the higher altitudes of the Andes have the coolest springs, with mean temperatures below . Temperatures grow warmer as spring progresses. During spring, precipitation in the country varies, with the greatest amounts being in northern Buenos Aires Province and the Littoral region, where the average precipitation exceeds . Arid regions (Arid Diagonal) have the lowest spring precipitation, with an average precipitation of less than . =Summer= Thunderstorm in Córdoba Province during summer In summer (December–February), temperatures range from an average of in the north to a mean of in the center of the country except for the southeastern parts of Buenos Aires Province, where temperatures are cooler in summer due to the maritime influence. In the extreme south of the country, the temperature averages ; at very high altitudes, the average is below . During summer, mean precipitation varies throughout the country: the eastern parts of Salta Province, Jujuy Province, northern Tucumán Province and all of Misiones Province are the wettest, receiving more than of precipitation during the season. Most of the Littoral region and Buenos Aires Province, average between . On the other hand, the Patagonia region is dry, with precipitation averaging less than – and occasionally below – much lower than other regions; Patagonia receives a monthly precipitation of . In the central and northern parts of the country, January is usually the wettest month, with an average monthly precipitation of in most places, even exceeding in some places. =Autumn= Autumn in Bariloche Autumn (March–May) is generally mild. Some forests and vineyards display red and orange autumn foliage, especially in mid-April. Frost arrives notably earlier in the south and later in the north. Mean temperatures can exceed in the northern parts of the country, while they can touch in most of the central parts of the country, and less than at the higher altitudes. As autumn progresses, mean temperatures fall in all regions, with March warmer than May. In the north, mean temperatures range from in March to in May. In the central parts of the country, mean temperatures in March are between , dropping to in May. The mean temperature in Tierra del Fuego Province in the extreme south is , and occasionally lower. Precipitation is highest in northeast Argentina and lowest in the Patagonia and Cuyo regions. In northeast Argentina, mean precipitation can exceed while in most of Buenos Aires Province and northwest Argentina, mean autumn precipitation ranges between . In most of the western parts of northwest Argentina, Patagonia (except for western Patagonia where precipitation is higher, averaging ) and Cuyo regions, precipitation can average less than . In the northwest, precipitation decreases as autumn progresses, ushering in the dry season. For example, in Tucuman Province, March averages more than of precipitation while May averages less than . In contrast, precipitation increases in Patagonia, particularly in the western parts where May precipitation can exceed . Factors that influence the climate Different meteorological factors affect the Argentine climate. Some of these factors are local while others come from other countries. =Geographic factors= The Andes is an important topographical factor in influencing the climate of Argentina. The most important geographical factors that influence the climate of Argentina are latitude, elevation, and distance from the sea. With Argentina extending from 22oS to 55oS, there are differences in the amount of incoming solar radiation and the amount of daylight received in each season, which affects temperature. Thus, temperatures decrease from north to south due to the differences in latitudes. Although the centre and the eastern parts of the country are mostly flat, the west is mountainous. Both the Andes and Sierras Pampeanas affect the climate of Argentina, leading to differences in temperature, pressure, and spatial distribution of precipitation depending on the topography and altitude. Here, the Andes exert an important influence on the climate. Owing to the higher altitudes of the Andes north of 40oS, they completely block the normal westerly flow, preventing low pressure systems containing moisture from the Pacific Ocean from coming in. Thus, much of Argentina north of 40oS is dominated by wind circulation patterns from the South Atlantic High. South of 40oS, the Andes are lower in altitude, allowing much of Patagonia to be dominated by westerly winds and air masses from the Pacific Ocean. However, the north–south orientation of the Andes creates a barrier for humid air masses originating from the Pacific Ocean. This is because they force these air masses upwards, cooling adiabactically. Most of the moisture is dropped on the Chilean side, causing abundant precipitation and cloudiness while on the Argentine side, the air warms adiabatically, causing it to become drier as it descends. Thus, an extensive rain–shadow is present in much of Patagonia, causing it to receive very little precipitation. The Sierras Pampeanas influences the climate on a much smaller scale than the Andes. Distance from the sea is another important geographic factor. Owing to the shape of the country, the close proximity to the ocean means that most of the country, excluding the north is moderated by the surrounding oceans, leading to lower thermal amplitudes than comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The two main currents that impact the climate of Argentina are the Brazil Current from the north and the Malvinas Current from the south (a branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current). The Brazil Current transports warm subtropical waters southwards while the Malvinas Current transports cold, subantarctic waters northwards. The Malvinas Current cools the coastal areas, particularly during winter when the current is more stronger. Thus, coastal areas of the Pampas have cooler summers and a longer frost period owing to the cold Malvinas Current. As well, it is the main factor in making Tierra del Fuego colder than at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since it is influenced by the cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current. =Atmospheric Circulation= Weather map showing the usual position of weather systems around the southern part of South America. The South Atlantic High and the South Pacific High both influence the pattern of winds and precipitations in Argentina. Owing to the greater high of the Andes at latitudes north of 40oS, much of Argentina is dominated by wind circulation patterns from the South Atlantic High. The South Atlantic High transports moisture from the Atlantic Ocean to Argentina. This occurs throughout the year due to the atmospheric pressure being lower on land than in the ocean. Much of the north and central parts of the country are affected by the South Atlantic High, with a strong influence in the eastern parts than in the west. This is due to the eastern parts being more frequently affected by the South Atlantic High, causing precipitation to decrease westwards. Throughout the year, the South Pacific High influences the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During the most intense cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to the southern tip of South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of the Andes and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of the Andes, it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on the eastern side of the Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS. The Chaco Low is a semi–permanent low pressure system situated east of the Andes that is approximately located between 20oS and 30oS during summer (displaced to the north in winter). It is stronger in the summer than in winter due to a combination of high insolation, dry surface conditions, and southward displacement of the South Atlantic and South Pacific High (this makes it difficult for cold fronts to enter at lower latitudes). The Chaco Low interacts with the South Atlantic High, generating a pressure gradient that draws moist air from the northeast to coastal and central regions of Argentina. It also forces easterly winds from the Amazon basin to move southward, which is reinforced by the funneling effect from both the Andes and the Brazilian Plateau. The Chaco Low brings large amounts of moisture that favour the development of convective thunderstorms during summer, reaching as far south as 35oS. This movement of air from the north owing to the interaction between the Chaco Low and the South Atlantic high is the strongest in summer when the Chaco Low is at its strongest. These winds bring hot, humid tropical air from the north. Sustained and intense winds from the north are responsible for severe weather events such as heat waves and severe convection. During winter, the Chaco Low weakens as a result of lower insolation. This is partly responsible for the decrease in winter precipitation over much of Argentina (in addition to northward displacement of westerlies) due to a weaker transport of air masses from the tropics. This excludes areas south of 40oS where it is dominated by westerlies. =El Niño and La Niña= Impacts of El Niño by region. Impacts of La Niña by region. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation leads to changes in the atmospheric circulation patterns (also known as teleconnections). Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, the impacts of the changes in atmospheric circulation patterns caused by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation are more clearly observed in the more humid eastern parts of the country (between Uruguay and southern Brazil). During El Niño events, precipitation is more higher than normal while during La Niña events, precipitation is lower than normal in the Pampas. In general, El Niño tends to increase precipitation during late spring and summer, particularly in the north. The impacts of La Niña in the eastern parts of the country (northeast and the Pampas) are observed in winter where precipitation is lower. In Northwest Argentina, El Niño events are associated with a strong reduction in rainfall during summer. In contrast, La Niña events increase precipitation in northwest Argentina. In the central–western parts of Patagonia, spring precipitation tends to be lower during La Niña events and higher during El Niño events. Summer precipitation exhibits an opposite pattern where La Niña years involve wetter summers while El Niño years featuring drier summers. On the Andes in central western Argentina, precipitation is higher during El Niño year. In general, La Niña events are associated with lower temperatures (particularly colder winters) in the Pampas. During winter, frosts are more common during La Niña events compared to El Niño events. This is due to a stronger southerly flow during La Niña events caused by a higher concentration of high pressure systems in the South Pacific and an increase in cyclonic activity (more low pressure systems) in the South Atlantic. This creates conditions that are favourable for bringing cold air from the south, particularly when there is a formation of a high pressure system over Patagonia (associated with the passage of a front) that is responsible for bringing cold air from the south. Thus, invasions of cold air from the south are more common during La Niña events. In contrast, warm spells in the Pampas and northern parts of the country are more intense and frequent during El Niño events. This is due to stronger westerly winds south of 40oS, leading to less frequent incursions of cold air from the south while enhancing winds from the north that bring in warm air. Although La Niña events lead to colder winters with more frequent incursions of cold air in both the north and central parts of the country, it leads to more frequent and intense warm spells in the last months of the year. In other regions, El Niño events lead to more frequent and intense warm spells in Northwest Argentina (during autumn), northeast Argentina (during spring) and central Argentina (during summer). Cold air anomalies arising from El Niño events are observed during spring and are the result of an increase in rainfall that lead to reductions in insolation. For the southern parts of the country, El Niño events are associated with more intense and frequent cold spells during the coldest months. In summer, El Niño events are associated with warmer summer temperatures in the southern parts of the country. =Antarctic Oscillation= The Antarctic Oscillation, also known as the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode is the main factor in tropospheric circulation variability south of 20oS and is characterized by pressure anomalies with one situated in the Antarctic and one situated in a band at around 40–50oS around the globe. It mainly affects middle and high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by the north–south displacement of the westerly wind belt that circle around Antarctica. Such variation in the position of the westerly wind belt affects the intensity and position of cold fronts and mid latitude storm systems and is partly responsible for variation in precipitation in the southern parts of Argentina. The Antarctic Oscillation is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. A positive phase is when the westerly wind belt is displaced to the south. The positive phase occurs when there is increased surface pressure over the southern parts of the South American continent and decreased pressure in Antarctica. This results in stronger westerly winds in the southern parts of the country while preventing cold fronts from penetrating inland, producing more stable conditions. Furthermore, the positive phase leads to warmer conditions south of 40oS, particularly during the summer in areas between 40–60oS. Precipitation is lower due to less frontal and orographic precipitation resulting from reduced westerly wind flow between 40–60OS. Opposite conditions occur in the negative phase when the westerly wind belt is shifted equatorward. Cold fronts moving northwards from the south penetrate more frequently, leading to more precipitation and cooler temperatures during the negative phase. The major effect of negative phase of the Antarctic Oscillation occurs in spring when it increases precipitation over southeastern South America. =Indian Ocean Dipole= The Indian Ocean Dipole is an atmospheric–oceanic phenomenon characterized by differences in sea surface temperatures between the eastern and western sections of the tropical Indian Ocean. Similar to the Antarctic Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. In the positive phase, the eastern section of the tropical Indian Ocean is cooler (lower sea surface temperature) and the western section is warmer than normal (higher sea surface temperature). On the other hand, the negative phase is characterized by warmer sea surface temperatures on the eastern section and cooler sea surface temperatures on the western section of the tropical Indian Ocean. Studies have shown that the Indian Ocean Dipole is partly responsible for variations in precipitation in Argentina and South America in general. During a positive phase, precipitation is higher in the Río de la Plata Basin due to teleconnections. Regional climate Climatic regions of Argentina: In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold, all determined by the expanse across latitude, range in altitude, and relief features. The vast size, and wide range of altitudes, contribute to Argentina's diverse climate. Argentina possesses a wide variety of climatic regions ranging from subtropical in the north to subantarctic in the far south. Lying between those is the Pampas region, which features a mild and humid climate. Under the Köppen climate classification, Argentina has 11 different climate types: Humid Subtropical (Cfa, Cwa), moderate oceanic (Cfb), warm semi-arid (BSh), subtropical highland oceanic (Cwb), warm desert (BWh), cold semi–arid (BSk), cold desert (BWk), moderate Mediterranean (Csb), cold oceanic (Cfc), and tundra (ET). Consequently, there is a wide variety of biomes in the country, including subtropical rain forests, semi-arid and arid regions, temperate plains in the Pampas, and cold subantarctic in the south. However, despite the diversity of biomes, about two-thirds of Argentina is arid or semi-arid. Argentina is best divided into six distinct regions reflecting the climatic conditions of the country as a whole. From north to south, these regions are Northwest, Chaco, Northeast, Cuyo/Monte, Pampas, and Patagonia. Each climatic region has distinctive types of vegetation. =Mesopotamia= The region of Mesopotamia includes the provinces of Misiones, Entre Ríos and Corrientes. has a subtropical climate with no dry season. Under the Köppen climate classification, it has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). The main features of the climate are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year; this abundant rainfall makes water scarcity and extended periods of drought uncommon; most of the region has a positive water balance. Average annual precipitation ranges from less than in the southern parts of the Province to approximately in the eastern parts. Precipitation is slightly higher in the summer than in the winter and generally decreases from east to west and from north to south. Summer precipitation levels range from a low of to a high of . In this season, most rain falls during convective thunderstorms. Autumn is one of the rainiest seasons, with many places receiving over . As in summer, precipitation falls mainly during convective thunderstorms. Winter is the driest season, with precipitation ranging from less than in the west to over in the east. Most of the precipitation during winter comes from frontal systems, particularly the sudestada (Spanish for strong southeasterly winds), bringing long periods of rain, cloudiness, cooler temperatures, and strong winds. Spring is similar to autumn, with a mean precipitation of . Summers are very hot while winters are mild to warm. The northern parts of the region are warmer than the southern parts. During heat waves, temperatures can exceed in the summer months, while in the winter months, cold air masses from the south can push temperatures below freezing, resulting in frost. However, such cold fronts are brief and are less intense than areas further south or at higher altitudes. Snowfall is extremely rare and mainly confined to the uplands of Misiones Province, where the last significant snowfall occurred in 1975 in Bernardo de Irigoyen. =Chaco= Western parts of Chaco are characterized by shrubs and low to medium forest cover due to lower precipitation. The Chaco region in the center-north completely includes the provinces of Chaco, and Formosa. Eastern parts of Jujuy Province, Salta Province, and Tucumán Province, and northern parts of Córdoba Province and Santa Fe Province are part of the region. As well, most of Santiago del Estero Province lies within the region. This region, located in the center-north has a subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and mild, dry winters. Under the Köppen climate classification, the west has a semi-arid climate (Bs) while the east has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Chaco is one of the few natural regions in the world located between tropical and temperate latitudes that is not a desert. Precipitation and temperature are relatively homogeneous throughout the region. Mean annual precipitation ranges from in the eastern parts of Formosa Province to a low of in the west and southwest. Summer witnesses the maximum precipitation. Summer rains are intense, and torrential rain is common, occasionally causing floods and soil erosion. During the winter months, precipitation is sparse. Eastern areas receive more precipitation than western areas since they are more influenced by moist air from the Atlantic Ocean, which penetrates the eastern areas more than the west, bringing in more precipitation. As a result, the vegetation differs: eastern areas are covered by forests, savannas, marshes and subtropical wet forest, and western areas are dominated by medium and low forests of mesophytic and xerophytic trees and a dense understory of shrubs and grasses. In all parts of the region, precipitation is highly variable from year to year. The Chaco region is the hottest in Argentina, with a mean annual temperature of . With mean summer temperatures occasionally reaching , the region has the hottest summers in the country. Winters are mild and brief, with mean temperatures in July ranging from in the northern parts to in the southernmost parts. Temperatures can reach as high has in summer, and during cold waves can fall to . =Northwest= Owing to orographic precipitation, the high rainfall creates a thick jungle on the eastern slopes in the Andes. The Altiplano is characterized by a cold, arid but sunny climate with large diurnal ranges. Northwest Argentina consists of the provinces of Catamarca, Jujuy, La Rioja, and western parts of Salta Province, and Tucumán Province. Although Santiago del Estero Province is part of northwest Argentina, much of the province lies in the Chaco region. Northwest Argentina is predominantly dry, hot, and subtropical. Owing to its rugged and varied topography, the region is climatically diverse, depending on the altitude, temperature and distribution of precipitation. Consequently, the vegetation will also differ. Under the Köppen climate classification, the region has five different climate types: semi–arid (BS), arid (BW), temperate without a dry season and temperate with a dry season (Cf and CW respectively), and, at the highest altitudes, an alpine. Precipitation is highly seasonal and mostly concentrated in the summer months. It is distributed irregularly due to the country's topography although it generally decreases from east to west. The eastern slopes of the mountains receives between of precipitation a year, though some places receive up to annually owing to orographic precipitation. The high rainfall on these first slopes creates a thick jungle that extends in a narrow strip along these ranges. The temperate valleys, the location of major cities such as Salta and Jujuy, have an average precipitation ranging between , with rainfall mainly concentrated in the summer months, often falling in short but heavy bursts. Valleys in the southern parts of the region are drier than those in the north due to the greater height of the Andes and the Sierras Pampeanas on the eastern slopes than the northern mountains, presenting a significant orographic barrier that blocks moist winds from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. These valleys receive less than of precipitation per year and are characterized by sparse vegetation adapted to the arid climate. The area further west in the Puna region, with an average altitude of , is mostly a desert due to the blocking of the easterly winds by the Andes and the northwest extension of the Sierras Pampeanas. Precipitation in the Puna region averages less than a year while high isolation, strong winds, and low humidity exacerbate the dry conditions. Temperatures in northwest Argentina vary by altitude. The temperate valleys have a temperate climate, with mild summers and dry and cool winters with regular frosts.In the Quebrada de Humahuaca valley, mean annual temperatures range from , depending on altitude. In the Calchaquí Valleys in Salta Province, the climate is temperate and arid with large thermal amplitudes, long summers, and a long frost-free period. In the valleys in the south in La Rioja Province, Catamarca Province and the southwest parts of Santiago del Estero Province, which is part of the arid Chaco ecoregion, temperatures during the summer are very high, averaging in January while winters are mild, averaging . Cold fronts from the south bringing cold Antarctic air can cause severe frosts in the valleys of La Rioja Province and Catamarca Province. In contrast, the Zonda wind, which occurs more often during the winter months, can raise temperatures up to with strong gusts, sometimes causing crop damage. Temperatures in the Puna region are much colder, with a mean annual temperature of less than owing to the high altitude. The Puna region is characterized by being cold with a large diurnal range but sunny throughout the year. =Cuyo= Most of the Cuyo region is dry, depending on rivers for irrigation The Cuyo region includes the provinces of Mendoza, San Juan, and San Luis. Western parts of La Pampa Province (as shown in map) also belong in this region, having similar climatic and soil characteristics to it. It has an arid or a semi-arid climate. The region's wide range in latitude, combined with altitudes ranging from to nearly , means that it has a variety of different climate types. In general, most of the region has a temperate climate, with valleys at higher altitudes having a milder climate. At the highest altitudes (over ), icy conditions persist year round. Average annual precipitation ranges from , though it is generally unpredictable. More than 85% of annual rainfall occurs from October to March, which constitutes the warm season. In contrast, the winter months are dry. Eastern and southeastern areas of the region receive more precipitation than the western areas since they receive more summer rainfall. Precipitation is highly variable from year to year and appears to follow a cycle between dry and wet years in periods of about 2, 4–5, 6–8, and 16–22 years. In wet years, easterly winds caused by the subtropical South Atlantic High are stronger, causing moisture to flow towards this region; during dry years, these winds are weaker. Summers in the region are hot and generally sunny; winters are dry and cold. Since this region has a wide range of altitudes, ranging from to nearly , temperatures can vary widely. The Sierras Pampeanas, which cross into both San Juan Province and San Luis Province, have a milder climate with mean annual temperatures ranging from . Throughout the region, the diurnal range is great, with very high temperatures during the day followed by cold nights. In all locations, at altitudes over , permafrost is present; icy conditions persist year round at altitudes over . The Zonda, a Foehn wind characterized by warm, dry air, can cause temperatures to exceed and occasionally , as occurred in 2003. However, cold waves are also common, caused by the channeling by the Andes of cold air from the south, making for frequent cold fronts during the winter months and bringing temperatures that can fall below freezing, and occasionally below at higher altitudes. =Pampas= Pampas landscape The Pampas includes all of Buenos Aires Province, eastern and southern Córdoba Province, eastern La Pampa Province, and southern Santa Fe Province. It is subdivided into two parts: the humid Pampas to the east, and the dry/semi–arid Pampas to the west. The Pampas has land that is appropriate for agriculture and raising livestock. It is a mostly flat area, interrupted only by the Tandil and Ventana sierras in its southern portion. The climate of the Pampas is characterized as temperate and humid with no dry season, featuring hot summers and mild winters (Cfa/Cfb according to the Köppen climate classification). The weather in the Pampas is variable due to the contrasting air masses and frontal storms that impact the region. Annual temperatures range from in the north to in the south. Precipitation increases toward the east and ranges from under in the south and west to in the northeast. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year in the easternmost parts of the Pampas; in the western parts, most of the precipitation is concentrated during the summer months, and winters are drier. The Pampas are influenced by the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which is responsible for variation in annual precipitation. An El Niño year leads to higher precipitation while a La Niña year leads to lower precipitation. Summers in the Pampas are hot and humid with coastal areas being modified by the cold Malvinas Current. Afternoon thunderstorms, which can bring intense amounts of precipitation, are common, as are heat waves that can bring temperatures in the range for a few days. These thunderstorms are known to have the most frequent lightning and highest convective cloud tops in the world. The severe thunderstorms produce intense hailstorms, floods, including flash floods, as well as the most consistently active tornado region outside the central and southeastern US. These are usually followed a day or two of strong Pampero winds from the south, which bring cool, dry air. Precipitation in the summer is high, with monthly amounts averaging between and in most places. Autumn arrives in March and brings periods of very rainy weather followed by dry, mild stretches and cool nights. Some places in the east receive rainfall throughout autumn whereas in the west, after the rains, the weather quickly becomes very dry. Generally, frost arrives in early April in the southernmost areas, in late May in the north, and ends by mid-September, although the dates of the first and last frosts can vary from year to year. Frost is rarely intense or prolonged and may not occur each year. Winters are mild with frequent frosts and cold spells. Temperatures are usually mild during the day and cold during the night. Most precipitation results from frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and sudestada, which bring long periods of precipitation, cloudiness and cooler temperatures, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. Dull, gray and damp weather characterize winters in the Pampas. Occasionally, tropical air masses from the north may move southward, providing relief from the cool, damp temperatures. Snowfall is extremely rare. When it does snow, it usually lasts for only a day or two. =Patagonia= The Patagonian climate is characterized by strong, persistent winds from the west year round, forming characteristic Flag trees. Chubut, Neuquén, Río Negro, Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego are the provinces that make up Patagonia. The Patagonian climate is classified as arid to semi-arid and temperate to cool temperate. One defining characteristic are the strong winds from the west which blow year round (stronger in summer than in winter), which favors evaporation and is a factor in making the region mostly arid. There are three major factors that influence the climate of the region: the Andes, the South Pacific High and South Atlantic High, and an isolation that is more pronounced in eastern than western areas. The north–south orientation of the Andes creates a barrier for humid air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean, forming an extensive rain shadow and causing most of the region to be arid. South of 52°S, the Andes are lower in elevation, reducing the rain shadow effect in Tierra del Fuego Province and allowing forests to thrive on the Atlantic coast. Patagonia is located between the subtropical high pressure belt and the subpolar low pressure zone, meaning it is exposed to westerly winds that are strong, since south of 40°S there is little land to block these winds. Because Patagonia is located between the semi-permanent anticyclones of the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean at around 30°S, and the Subpolar Low at around 60°S, the movement of the high and low pressure systems along with ocean currents determine the precipitation pattern. The influence of the Pacific Ocean, general circulation patterns, and the topographic barrier caused by the Andes results in one of the strongest precipitation gradients in the world. Precipitation steeply decreases from west to east, ranging from in the west on the Andean foothills at 41°S to in the central plateaus. The high precipitation in the Andes in this region allows forests to thrive as well as glaciers and permanent snowfields. Most of the region receives less than of precipitation per year. The aridity of the region is due to the combination of low precipitation, strong winds, and high temperatures in the summer months, all of which cause high evaporation rates. In most of Patagonia, precipitation is concentrated in the winter months, except for the northeastern and southern parts, where precipitation is more evenly distributed. Thunderstorms are infrequent, occurring only during summer. Snowfall occurs mainly in the west and south, which can result in strong snowstorms. Patagonia's temperatures are relatively cold for its latitude due to the cold Malvinas Current (also called the Falkland(s) Current) and the high altitude. A characteristic of the temperature pattern is the NW–SE distribution of isotherms due to the presence of the Andes. The warmest parts of the region are in northern parts of Rio Negro Province and Neuquén Province, where mean annual temperatures range from , while the coldest are in western Santa Cruz Province and Tierra del Fuego Province, where mean temperatures range from . At higher altitudes in the Andes stretching from Neuquén Province to Tierra del Fuego Province, mean annual temperatures are below . Strong westerly winds can decrease the perception of temperature (wind chill), particularly in summer. The annual range of temperatures in Patagonia is lower than at similar latitudes in the northern hemisphere owing to the narrowness of the region at higher latitudes and the stronger maritime influence. Statistics Mean temperatures in Argentina (including the British territory, the Falkland Islands) The average annual precipitation ranges from in the driest parts of Patagonia to over in the westernmost parts of Patagonia and the northeastern parts of the country. Mean annual temperatures range from in the far south to in the north. Shown below are the mean monthly temperature and precipitation for selected places in Argentina along with the overall averages for the country (based on a 0.5o latitude/longitude grid).

It is considered to be the wettest place in Argentina. =High= In general, the highest temperatures in Argentina are recorded in the northern Chaco region where temperatures of have been recorded. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the highest temperature ever recorded in Argentina and South America was in Rivadavia, Salta Province on December 11, 1905. Since 1961 when nationwide temperature monitoring began, the warmest year on record is 2017 when mean temperatures nationally were above the mean national temperatures based on the 1981–2010 reference period. =Low= Patagonia and the Puna region register the lowest temperatures in Argentina where temperatures lower than have been recorded. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Argentina and South America was in Sarmiento, Chubut Province on June 1, 1907. This was recorded under standard conditions. On a national scale, the coldest year on record is 1975 when mean temperatures nationally were below the mean national temperatures based on the 1981–2010 reference period. =Precipitation= With an average annual precipitation of , Lago Frías in Río Negro Province is considered to be the wettest place in Argentina. Although an average annual precipitation of has been recorded in Lago Tromen in Neuquén Province, the validity of the data is dubious owing to fewer years of data. Lago Frías also has the record for wettest monthly precipitation in Argentina: of precipitation was recorded in May 1951. In contrast, the driest place is Angualasto, San Juan Province, which only receives of precipitation a year. The highest recorded one-day rainfall total occurred on April 2, 2013, when of rain fell in La Plata at the La Plata Astronomical Observatory, causing massive flooding and power outages. On a national scale, the wettest year on record is 1985 when annual precipitation in the country was 29.6% higher than the mean annual precipitation (based on a reference period of 1981–2010). The driest year on record in the country is 1988 when annual precipitation was 29.9% lower than the mean annual precipitation (based on a reference period of 1981–2010). Natural disasters =Floods= The Pampas are vulnerable to flooding owing to their flat topography and poor water drainage. Argentina's geomorphic characteristics make the country highly vulnerable to floods. These floods can damage infrastructure, cause loss of life, increase the risk of diseases, and negatively impact agricultural productivity, which is one of the main economic activities of the country. Many of the large Argentinean cities and agriculturally productive areas lie near rivers. The plains are at highest risk for flooding, particularly in the northeastern and central parts of the country, including Greater Buenos Aires. This is because these plains, which cover 35% of the land area in the country (including the Chaco and Pampean areas), are characterized by a flat landscape, which can impede proper water drainage. Both the Parana and Paraguay basins have a flat landscape and are thus highly susceptible to flooding due to river overflows following high rainfall. These floods can last for months, particularly in the Parana River, owing to its large basin. In the most extreme case, during the year 1982–1983, the floods in the Parana River persisted for more than a year, negatively impacting the area both socially and economically. Major flooding events in the Parana River include those of 1992 and 1997 and have been more frequent since the 1980s due to higher precipitation trends. Similarly, in Buenos Aires Province, flooding occurs due to river overflows and poor water drainage; major flooding events in the province occurred in 1987, 2002/2003, 2012 and in 2014, causing damage to agriculture production. Most of the flooding events occur in El Niño years owing to higher rainfall. Flooding can also affect Patagonia and urban centers in the northwest, but the number of people affected and economic losses are lower than those in the Pampas owing to lower population densities. Flooding can jeopardize access to safe water. A leptospirosis outbreak occurred following a flood in 1998. =Droughts and dust storms= Droughts are the most harmful natural disasters that are difficult to monitor, identify, analyse, and to manage. Events of droughts have considerable and serious negative impacts socially and economically. In the case of Argentina, it is highly dependent on rainfall in order to sustain production related to cereals and oilseeds. Argentina is highly dependent on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. In arid parts of the country, agricultural production is highly dependent on irrigation, making it vulnerable to droughts as they can reduce the availability of water which can negatively affect the commercial production of agricultural products or food security for smaller producers that depend on agriculture to feed their families. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts during the last decade have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. In 2018, a severe drought affected the country from the final months of 2017 to April 2018 was the worst in the last 50 years and one of the 10 most destructive climate related events in the world in 2018. Rainfall in some parts of the country were 50% below normal from December to February. As a result of this, yields of soybeans and maize were reduced by 31% and 20% respectively, both of which make up 37% of all of Argentina's exports. The drought lead to $6 billion in losses and caused the country to enter into a recession. Before the drought in 2018, a drought in 2009 was previously the worst drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge swaths of soy, corn and wheat fields were affected. It was estimated that the country lost more than US$5 billion from the drought. A drought in 2011 affected farming of soy and corn, causing losses of US$2.5 billion. Córdoba. Drier parts of the country are highly prone to dust storms. These include areas west of Buenos Aires, which can average more than eight dust storms per year, and parts of Patagonia, owing to its aridity and windy climate. Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone to dust storms owing to extensive areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that erode the rock, which becomes a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind. Dust storms are more frequent during droughts, particularly in agricultural areas. Dust storms can effect large areas, leading to numerous impacts. These dust storms can lead to loss of crop and livestock, affecting the local economy. Productive topsoil may be lost during dust storms, leading to loss in soil productivity, which can increase soil erosion and negatively affect crop productivity in the long term. In addition to the impact on agriculture, dust storms can damage cars and buildings, lower visibility on roads, affect air quality, and affect water quality in rivers and lakes. =Tornadoes and severe weather= Argentina experiences frequent tornadoes each year. Tornadoes occur in the South American \\"tornado alley\\" (Spanish: Pasillo de los Tornados), which includes the provinces of Entre Ríos, Córdoba Province, Santa Fe, La Pampa and Greater Buenos Aires. The frequency of tornadoes is similar to the one found in Tornado Alley in North America. However, there is no exact number of tornado occurrences per year, owing to the lack of data. These regions have the most frequent and intense mesoscale convective systems. Tornadoes occur between November and April. In this region, which occupies most of the Pampas, cold air from Patagonia meets warm, humid air from Brazil with dry air coming from the Andes. When these air masses collide, they can produce intense storms, frequently becoming supercells that can produce tornadoes. With a larger number of convective storms, there is a higher chance that some of these storms will produce tornadoes. Most tornadoes are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths. The strongest tornado recorded in Argentina occurred in 1973 when a tornado struck San Justo, Santa Fe. The tornado was an F5 on the Fujita scale, with winds up to , making it the worst tornado in Latin America and the Caribbean. Severe storms impact large cities more often and can damage cars, houses and disrupt public services such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste. The foothills of the Andes and the Sierras de Cordoba are vulnerable to hail. This is because the Andes force humid air from the Atlantic upwards, intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms, making hail more likely. Mendoza, a city located in the Andean foothills, experiences frequent hailstorms that can impact the agriculture of the region. Hailstorms have caused serious losses in both urban and rural areas. It is estimated that wine and fruit production experience yearly losses of US$50 million and US$30 million, respectively, due to hail. Most of these hailstorms occur in the summer although they can occur in winter, particularly in the east where warm and humid air from the north frequently collides with cold air from the south, leading to convective thunderstorms that can produce hail. Storm surges caused by extratropical cyclones have been recorded along the coastal areas. These storm surges are formed from strong winds that blow towards the land. They are formed due to the interaction between the semi-permanent South Pacific High and a low pressure system over the Atlantic, southeast of Argentina, creating strong winds from the south or southwest. The sudestada, which brings the worst storm surges, occurs when there is a high pressure system over southern Argentina in the Atlantic Ocean that interacts with a low pressure over Uruguay and southern Brazil, causing strong winds from the southeast. Storm surges have caused flooding of coastal areas, leading to extensive property loss and other damage. It is also the main natural factor in the erosion of coastlines. The flooding as a result of storm surges are particularly destructive in flat coastal areas such as the Rio de La Plata shores, and the Salado Basin. =Snowstorms and cold waves= Argentina regularly receives cold air from the south that can reach low latitudes owing to the influence of the Andes. Cold waves are usually accompanied with severe snowstorms or extremely cold conditions that can have a devastating impact on the country's economy. These snowstorms and/or extremely cold conditions can partially or completely paralyze activities in large areas of Patagonia and the center of the country. In addition, cold conditions can lead to energy shortages during the winter months due to increased demand. The low temperatures brought by these cold waves can cause frosts that can damage plants, severely affecting agricultural production and devastating the local economy. Climate change High temperatures reached during the December 2013 heat wave, the longest and most severe ever recorded in Argentina. According to the national government and scientists, climate change is predicted to have a significant effect on the climate of Argentina. There has been an increase in annual precipitation in almost all of Argentina during the 20th century, particularly in the northeast and the center of the country, where agricultural production has expanded to the west by more than in areas that were previously too dry during middle of the 20th century. In contrast, the Andean part of Patagonia, along with the Cuyo region, has seen a decrease in precipitation, leading to a reduction in river flow in the last 100 years. These trends were observed with an increase in the river–stream flows in most of the country, excluding rivers originating from the Andes, and an increase in extreme precipitation events that led to considerable socioeconomic losses. The increase in precipitation has led to more variability in precipitation from year to year in the northern parts of the country, with a higher risk of prolonged droughts. Mean temperatures have increased by between 1901 and 2012, slightly lower than the global average. Temperatures in the Andean part of Patagonia have increased by more than , which has caused the retreat of almost all of the glaciers. This is affecting water availability to the arid areas of the country that depend on glacier meltwater. Higher temperatures can reduce winter snowfall, causing river flow to decrease, which in turn can reduce hydroelectric energy production; losses of up to 40% have been observed. In the last half of the 20th century, the lack of snow in the highest peaks in the Cuyo region has impacted agriculture and viticulture production due to the decrease in available water in the rivers. Outside of Patagonia, mean temperatures have increased at a slower rate since the increase in minimum temperatures is counteracted by the decrease in maximum temperatures. There has been a decrease in the number of days with frost, and there have been increases in the frequency of hot nights and heat waves throughout the country. Within the next two or three decades (2016–2035), mean temperatures are predicted to increase by under the two scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. In both scenarios, the projected warming will be more pronounced during the summer months. The predicted trend for precipitation is not as clear as the one for temperature. In the northern and central regions, precipitation is predicted to increase while in most of central–western Argentina and Patagonia, precipitation is predicted to decrease. Because Argentina is potentially vulnerable to climate change, such projected changes based on the models could exacerbate current problems or create new problems associated with climate change in Argentina. Scientists predict that glaciers will continue to recede and melt or, in some areas, disappear. It is also predicted that the Cuyo region could face a potential water crisis due to an increase in water demand caused by a reduction in river streamflows. In northern Patagonia, a similar situation is projected in which there will be a negative impact on fruit and vegetable growing owing to a reduction in the river flow in the Colorado and Chubut rivers. In the north and central parts of the country, the higher temperatures and lower precipitation projected for this region will lead to higher evaporation, intensifying droughts and leading to desertification. Heat waves could become more frequent and intense, negatively impacting agricultural production while placing more demand on energy needs. Intense precipitation could become more common, increasing the likelihood of suffering from events such as flooding, since most of its population lives in urban areas near a body of water (rivers, lakes and oceans). Climate change could extend the habitats of vectors carrying tropical diseases such as malaria southwards. Though most of the coastal regions of Argentina will not suffer permanent flooding associated with sea level rise, it is predicted that storm surges will become more frequent in coastal areas, affecting locations such as Buenos Aires.

There are four basic ways that spud guns may achieve this: * By the combustion of a gaseous fuel-air mixture; this is generally called a combustion launcher, and its pressure is limited primarily by the energy density of the fuel-air mixture (less than with all safe fuels). * By the release of compressed gas (normally air) through a valve; such a launcher is typically referred to as a pneumatic launcher, and its power is limited primarily by the pressure of the air supply, be that from a compressor, manual pump or bottled gas. * By the explosion of a dry ice bomb placed in the pipe before the projectile, generally referred to as a dry ice bomb cannon, these are limited in power by the materials and size of the dry ice bomb but firing pressures can be around . * By the combustion of a pre- pressurised fuel-air mixture; this is called a hybrid launcher, and yields higher pressures than that of a normal combustion spud gun, limited only by the construction of the launcher (generally a few hundred pounds-force per square inch). =Combustion launchers= Combustion powered spud guns typically have the least complex designs, the four basic elements of which are: * A fuel system * A combustion chamber * An ignition source * A barrel In order to fire, the operator loads a projectile into the barrel, adds fuel to the combustion chamber (for example aerosols or propane), and triggers the ignition source (often using a piezoelectric barbecue igniter). The fuel then ignites, creating hot expanding gases, and forcing the projectile out of the barrel. Distances vary greatly depending on many factors, including the type of fuel used, the efficiency of the fuel/air ratio, the combustion chamber/barrel ratio, and the flight characteristics of the projectile. Common distances vary from 100 to 200 meters, and there is a reported case of a cannon exceeding 500 meters of range. Advanced combustion launchers may include metered propane or calcium carbide (acetylene) injection to ensure proper fueling, chamber fans to mix the fuel with the air and accelerate venting of the chamber after firing, multiple spark gaps (spark strips) to decrease combustion time, and high-voltage ignition sources (flyback circuits, stun guns, camera flashes, etc.). Combustion launchers are usually less powerful than their pneumatic or hybrid counterparts, especially when hairspray / alcohol is used as a propellant. Bottled oxygen can be added to the firing chamber, though this can cause an explosion of the pipe when firing, potentially injuring anyone nearby. =Pneumatic launchers= thumbright220pxA large pneumatic design: The projectile is loaded in the muzzle (not pictured), which is then attached to the cannon (at 2). The air reservoir (3) is filled to using the Schrader valve (4). Upon opening the solenoid valve (1), the air from the reservoir is transferred to the projectile, which is fired out of the muzzle. Pneumatic launchers are considered a little more difficult to build due to the need of a completely airtight construction. These cannons have four basic components: * A filling valve * An air chamber * A pressure release valve * A barrel In a pneumatic spud gun, air is pumped into the pressure chamber. After the desired chamber pressure is reached, the pressure release valve is opened, allowing the gas to expand down the barrel, propelling the projectile forwards. The filling valve is usually a commonly available type such as a Schrader or Presta valve but other assemblies to pressurise the cannon such as quick release connections with ball or check valves have been used. The pressure release valve is often one of a variety of commercially available types such as a plumbing ball valve, an irrigation sprinkler valve or a quick exhaust valve. Experienced builders often make their own valves for this purpose to gain greater flow and faster actuation. The most common custom design used is the piston valve. Multiple valves arranged to be triggered together are occasionally used as an alternative to a single larger valve. The range of pneumatic cannons is more variable than the range of combustion spud guns due to the increased variation possible in the components. Typical ranges are slightly higher because of the greater power, but the maximum range of some high power pneumatic cannons has been said to be over . Cannon with a calculated range exceeding 1 mile. Pneumatic spud guns are generally more powerful than combustion spud guns. A typical combustion gun generates average chamber pressures of about with peaks of around , while the average pneumatic gun can operate at pressures in the vicinity of . In recent times, it has become increasingly common for metal pneumatic launchers to use even higher pressures, sometimes up to or higher. =Dry ice launchers= PVC dry ice cannon in use, 1.5kg (3 pounds) of concrete is poured at the bottom to reinforce it, and plastic sleeves are used to stiffen the lower (highest pressure) part. A dry ice cannon uses the sublimation of solid carbon dioxide to generate the gas pressure to propel a projectile and is a variation of the burst disk cannon. The oldest examples simply involve dropping pieces of dry ice into a tube closed at one end and sealing the other end by jamming the projectile in. When the pressure of the carbon dioxide from the subliming dry ice builds high enough, the projectile will be blown out of the tube. The pressures of such devices are not very high as it only needs to build enough to overcome the static friction of the projectile jammed in the barrel. Tens of psi is most likely. The range is likely restricted to 100- yards. A more modern example is the dry ice bomb launcher. A plastic bottle containing water has some dry ice added and is quickly sealed and dropped down a tube closed at one end. A projectile is inserted in after it. The water accelerates the sublimation of the dry ice and the pressure from the carbon dioxide gas produced eventually ruptures the plastic bottle and launches the projectile. The rupturing pressure of a 0.5 L plastic soda bottle is between in the open air but when confined in a pipe, it could be higher. Due to the operation of a dry ice bomb cannon extra safety issues are present: * The dry ice bomb used for propulsion can achieve bursting pressure in a matter of seconds to hours depending on the quantity of water and dry ice. If too little dry ice, it also may not achieve bursting pressure at all. These timing issues can cause belief that the cannon has failed to fire but attempting to unload the cannon may then provide the extra stress on the bottle needed for it to rupture. * The piping and any reinforcement may be insufficiently strong for the high pressure spike when the dry ice bomb explodes and consequently rupture. * The recoil of such cannons can be very great due to the high pressure combined with the large internal diameter piping needed for the bottles (5–9 cm; 2–3½ in) resulting in them being ill-suited for hand held firing. Compared to the operation of other spud guns, dry ice bomb cannons are similar in firing principle to a light-gas gun of the pneumatic type; the plastic bottle performing the task of the burst disk albeit in a less controlled manner. Another means of utilising dry ice in spud guns is to use the sublimation of dry ice to create substantial pressure behind a valve, and placing a barrel on the other side of that valve with a projectile loaded into it. Pressures behind the valve can reach upwards of , and by quickly releasing the valve, the projectile can be launched. Whilst this method is more controllable and in many means safer than utilising a soda bottle as a burst disk (provided pressure rated valves and piping are used), it is limited in that quick release valves, such as ball valves, are generally not bigger in diameter than 1 or 2 inches. Additionally, they cannot be opened as rapidly as a soda bottle will rupture, and consequently there is less immediate airflow. However, this is offset by the fact that such a design can operate at more than double the pressure of a typical dry ice bomb launcher, as soda bottles will rupture at only . =Hybrid launchers= A hybrid launcher consists of seven basic elements: *A fuel system (usually metered propane) *An air filling valve (see pneumatic launchers) *One or more pressure gauges *A high pressure combustion chamber *A pressure-triggered main valve (burst disk) *A barrel *An ignition source (see combustion launchers) A hybrid combines principles of the combustion and pneumatic spud gun. It uses a pre- pressurised mixture of fuel and air to get more power out of a given chamber volume. In order to fire, the operator first readies the pressure-triggered valve then injects several times the normal amount of fuel and appropriately more air. When the ignition source is triggered, the pressure from the combustion causes the main valve to open and propels the projectile out of the barrel with the released combustion gases. The hybrid is capable of higher velocities than a combustion or pneumatic spud gun because the pressure generated is higher than that in a combustion gun (for most fuels), and the shock wave moves faster than it can in a pneumatic (for most gases), due to the higher temperature. Projectiles fired by a hybrid have broken the sound barrier. A hybrid using a fuel and air mix at twice atmospheric pressure is said to be using a 2X mix. Higher mixtures can be used and will produce even higher pressures. The fuel and air needs to be measured and matched carefully to ensure reliable operation; hence the use of accurate air pressure gauges and fuel meters. =Vacuum cannons= Vacuum cannons differ from typical pneumatic cannons in that they apply a negative pressure to the front of the projectile in order to \\"pull\\" it out of the barrel. They typically fire light projectiles and do not have any practical applications outside of demonstrating air pressure theory. Primary materials =Plastics= * PVC-U (Polyvinyl chloride, unplasticized): Highly popular due to its availability and relatively low cost. PVC pipes are available in a wide variety of sizes and pressure ratings. In industry, however, they are illegal for compressed air applications—if they are damaged under pressure the plastic can fail explosively. * ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene): Another popular plastic piping material, more expensive and less common than PVC but available in the same sizes and pressure ratings. Unlike PVC it is used in compressed air systems as it splits rather than shatters on failure. It also has a greater temperature tolerance (−40 °C to +80 °C, or −40 to 175 °F) compared to 0 °C to +60 °C or 30 to 140 °F for PVC). Both PVC and ABS piping are also available in forms which are not pressure rated. Use of unrated plastic piping and fittings is a common source of cannon failure and poses a much greater risk to a cannon operator. =Metals= *Steel: The very high pressure rating of steel piping makes it a familiar sight on high-powered hybrid cannons. It is however much more expensive than any other common piping material. The extra weight and joining difficulties are also a consideration. *Copper: As a common plumbing material, copper pipes and associated fittings are readily available. They have higher pressure ratings and flow compared to similar plastic piping. The drawbacks are that copper is heavier, and up to four times the cost of PVC or ABS pipes of similar external diameters. *Aluminium: Aluminium is a lightweight metal with good corrosion resistance. Aluminium pipes are sometimes used as barrels on spud guns on their own and machined aluminium is a popular material for particularly unique designs. *Brass: Often brass fittings are used on spud guns for small parts of the construction like fuel systems, because it is one of the most common materials for small pipe fittings. Occasionally large parts of spud guns are machined entirely out of brass. Valve types =Manual= *Ball Valve: Made out of either plastic or metal, ball valves are considered inferior by many enthusiasts due to their slow opening times. For those on a tight budget or in low-power setups, ball valves are ideal. Some choose to modify their valves by attaching a pneumatic actuator or spring to achieve a faster opening speed. *Blowgun: A blowgun is a small hand held device used to blow away debris from a work area and is designed to be used attached to a compressed air line. It uses a sprung poppet valve operated by a lever to allow air through its body and out through a specially shaped nozzle. In spudgunning it is used to pilot larger valves—releasing a small volume of air to allow a piston or diaphragm to fly back and release a much larger volume of air into the barrel. It is also used as the primary valve for small cannons which fire airsoft pellets and so do not require high air flow. Blowguns can be modified to increase airflow. =Electric= *Sprinkler valve (otherwise known as a solenoid valve): The use of irrigation sprinkler valves as pneumatic valves has become increasingly popular for spudgunning. These valves are intended to be electrically triggered causing a solenoid to depressurise a diaphragm and allow airflow through. It is also possible to remove the solenoid and, instead, to actuate the valve manually with a blowgun to depressurise the diaphragm. Such modifications allow the valve to open as much as 3 to 5 times faster. =Pneumatic= *Diaphragm valve: A diaphragm valve is used in pneumatic cannons where the barrel is within the air chamber. It is a disk of flexible material mounted directly behind the barrel that seals it when pressure is increased behind the disk. The design is such that air leaks past the diaphragm from behind it to the chamber around the barrel, sealing the soft rubber against the butt of the barrel. Once the chamber is fully pressurised the compressed air behind the diaphragm is quickly vented, causing the centre of the diaphragm to flex backwards, exposing the butt of the barrel to the compressed air inside the chamber, which rapidly exhausts through the barrel, launching the projectile. Sprinkler valves have also been modified to act in the same manner a diaphragm valve operates; changing the triggering of the valve to a release of air controlled by a blowgun valve, rather than electronically. *Piston valve: The gold standard of pneumatic spudgunning is the piston valve, due to its extremely high rate of flow and opening speed. It works in an almost identical fashion to a diaphragm valve but replaces the flexible diaphragm with a hard rubber-faced piston. The valve opening is generally as wide as or wider than the barrel diameter, so there is very little constriction of airflow. Piston valves also open much faster than either ball or solenoid valves. However, construction of this type of valve is inherently complex, and some choose to order pre-built valves through the internet. *Quick Exhaust Valve (QEV): a commercial piston or diaphragm valve in a metal body intended for the quick venting of pneumatic cylinders. In spudgunning they are ideal barrel sealing valves with faster opening times than custom piston valves and high flow rates. They can be commonly found in sizes from ⅛ inch to 1½ inches (3–40 mm) and sometimes even larger models. It provides an easy option for inexperienced spud-gun builders but the cost is usually greater than for any other valve type. * The Quick Dump Valve is a recent addition to the choices of valves for spudding. A QDV is a spool valve that is balanced under pressure with one end of the spool oriented toward the barrel. The spool is manually unbalanced allowing pressure between the end of the spool and the projectile in the barrel. The air pressure then forces the spool back and the projectile forward. Since the valve is triggered with no pilot pressure, the valve snaps open with no pilot pressure to hinder it. Currently it is not commercially for sale and must be hand built by the hobbyist like most piston valves. *Burst Disk Valve: Used in a few pneumatics but primarily in hybrid cannons, burst valves are considered the ideal pressure release mechanism as they allow an unobstructed flow of high pressure air. Burst disks have no moving parts, making them very reliable. They are very appealing for hybrid cannons because they can withstand the low pressure gas mix in the chamber before ignition, yet fail as planned upon successful ignition. The high pressure combustion gases are released into the barrel at a rate which generates greater velocities than a mechanical valve could allow. Pneumatic cannon burst discs work similarly. The disc and projectile are loaded, and the chamber is pressurised until the disc ruptures. Unfortunately, this usually does not give the operators much in the way of control over timing, although a puncturing mechanism can be used. Burst disks are of no specific material and may consist of plastic or thin sheet metal or foil. :Alternate designs have also been used which use a sharp projectile to puncture the burst disk, like a mortar or using a manual puncturing device to trigger failure of the disk. These allow total control over burst disk cannons without the need for hybrid technology and materials as simple as plastic tape can be used for the disk. :Burst disk cannons have also been made which are fired electrically, using a nichrome wire to trigger failure by heating. Connections =Welding, soldering and gluing= *Solvent welding: used for similar plastic connections using solvent fittings, the solvent temporarily dissolves the polymer chains of the plastic and the parts to be joined are brought together. On rehardening, the polymer chains from each part are entangled and so form a solid weld. *Metal welding: used to form strong joints between similar metals by melting the points of connection together. It is an uncommon process in spudgun construction due to the equipment necessary to make the welds. *Soldering: commonly used in the construction of copper pipe based spudguns, a solder with a lower melting point than the copper is melted and drawn into the gaps between pipe and fitting with capillary action, holding to pipe and fitting with a wetting action before hardening. *Gluing: the use of epoxy resin in small designs is common for the making of custom parts but it is rare to see glues used for structural connections. Epoxy resin is mostly used in applications where normal fittings would limit the possibilities. *Duct tape: sometimes used in simple cannons, it is unsuitable for sealing any significant pneumatic pressure and if used on a combustion cannon the heat produced can soften the adhesive and melt the tape, greatly weakening any seal or joint it creates. =Mechanical joints= *Compression Fittings: primarily seen on copper pipe spudguns, the compression fitting squeezes a metal ring against the pipe between a nut and the fitting body to form the connection. Easier than solder fittings and requiring only a spanner they are much more expensive and are of greater weight. *Threaded Fittings: commonly available in BSP or NPT (not interchangeable) they generally require a fitting attached to a pipe by other means to allow screwing into another threaded fitting. The exception to this is steel pipe, the ends of which can have the appropriate thread cut into them. *Flange joints: on large steel spudguns, pipe and fittings are sometimes bolted together by means of flanges with a gasket sandwiched between them to provide an airtight joint. *Cam Locks: on spudguns with interchangeable barrels a cam lock is sometimes used to connect barrels to the cannon as it provides a quick and simple solution to switching barrels. Two levers either side of the socket side of the fitting rotate internal cams to lock in or release the plug side of the fitting to which a barrel is attached. The sound barrier It is rare for a spud gun to be powerful enough to break the sound barrier, although there are some cases of this happening using specialized designs. The spud guns used are typically hybrids; but some pneumatic cannons have achieved the feat, either by using a special low-density gas, such as helium, Used helium to attain supersonic velocities. or high pressures combined with a fast valve. Attained approximately Mach 1 (340 m/s; 1120 ft/s) with and a fast valve. There is also one reported case of a combustion design achieving super- sonic velocities. The difficulty in breaking the barrier arises from the speed of the particles within the gas. The projectile cannot travel faster than the gas particles, which are limited to travel at the speed of sound. The problem is solved by increasing the speed of the particles, either by: *Using lighter molecules, as occurs when helium is used in a pneumatic. *Heating the gases to far higher temperatures, and thus giving them more energy. This allows hybrids and combustions to achieve supersonic velocities. *Using steel and much higher pressures of or more, but achieving these pressures is difficult. CO2 gas, although it can reach these pressures, is not suitable due to its high density. Supersonic velocities may theoretically be attained by pneumatics with a sufficiently large \\"dead space\\" between the main valve and projectile. The incoming air can raise the pressure rapidly in this dead space, creating high temperatures sometimes sufficient to achieve supersonic velocities. This particular effect has not yet been successfully used, but has been discussed, as both adiabatic and shock heating are documented phenomena in gases. The highest projectile speed recorded from a spud gun is (approximately 2.7 times the speed of sound) with a 20 mm plastic slug from a hybrid using a pre- ignition mixture of air and propane. Supersonic velocities have been obtained using the related vacuum bazooka with a de Laval nozzle. This also relies on significantly lowering the density of the gas. Practical uses Although spudguns are created and used for the purpose of recreation there are other devices which work on identical principles in many other fields with more serious uses. =Entertainment= *Promotional sports cannons: Portable pneumatic cannons which run on bottled CO2 are common at large sports games in the U.S. where they are used to project items such as T-shirts or wrapped food into the audience. Such cannons can be dangerous: the Phillie Phanatic injured a fan with a hot dog cannon in June 2018.https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/phillie-phanatics-hot-dog-cannon- sends-phillies-fan-to-emergency-room/ Such \\"air cannons\\", as they are often called, tend to be made of higher-quality materials than an average pneumatic spudgun, but they use the same methods of operation. *Special effects cannons: In film and theatre productions, pneumatic cannons (such as an air mortar) are often used as a pyrotechnic-free method of material projection. These can vary from simple ball valve, manually operated models to electronically triggered designs operated from a remote control panel depending on the exact requirements. =Industry= A typical propane gun bird scarer *Hail cannons: these are very large devices which consist of a combustion chamber and a large funnel shape mounted on top of it. A gas mix is ignited in the combustion chamber and the funnel directs the blast wave upwards. They are intended to protect crops from hail damage by disrupting hail formation with the shock waves. There has however been no scientific proof of their effectiveness. *Air cannons: This can mean: ** A pneumatic spudgun ** Air cannon (mechanics), a compressed air device for creating high pressure shock waves under water *Bird scarers: these devices are essentially automatic combustion cannons. They require bottled propane gas and a lead-acid battery. At intervals they ignite a propane/air mix to produce a loud explosion (up to 150 decibels close to the device) to scare birds from crop fields or near airport runways. *Chicken cannons: Many aircraft parts must be able to survive the impact of a bird in flight, known as a birdstrike. Pneumatic guns are used to project a bird, typically a dead chicken, into a product designed to imitate a birdstrike. Aircraft canopies, engines, and critical flight control surfaces will normally undergo this type of stress testing to determine whether they are strong enough to withstand a birdstrike in flight. *Shock tubes: used to test hypersonic and supersonic combustion ramjets. *Pneumatic line throwers for launching lines for rescue missions or between ships for replenishment at sea as well as a number of other applications. =Military= *Combustion light- gas guns are weaponised combustion cannons which burn a low-molecular-weight gas such as hydrogen to provide a higher specific impulse than relatively high-molecular-weight conventional solid propellants. Safety Spud guns by nature are hazardous and can present safety issues if poorly constructed or used. Users should follow the same rules as if handling a conventional firearm (see gun safety), but given the frequently improvised materials and construction used in spudguns, it is particularly important for the user to use basic ear and eye protection when operating a spudgun. Legal issues In some jurisdictions spud guns are outlawed or have restrictions on their use and may require licenses and certification of the gun. In popular culture * In the \\"Workaholics\\" episode \\"To Friend a Predator\\", a Potato Gun is used in an attempt to stop the protagonist, but instead hits Blake in the back. * In The Trailer Park Boys, Julian, Ricky, Bubbles, Corey and Trevor use spud guns to investigate the enormous damage to their crops of cannabis. This was because real guns would attract too much attention. * In the film Tremors 3: Back to Perfection, Jack Sawyer suggested to Burt Gummer that they build a potato gun to fight the Ass-Blasters. Using parts from a junkyard, they formed a variant of a potato gun that shot makeshift flaming arrows that were deadly to the Ass Blasters and killed two. * In an episode of Nickelodeon's Drake & Josh, Drake buys a potato gun, accidentally hitting Josh, making him drop the weights he was lifting, causing him to break his foot. * Dwight Schrute on the U.S. version of The Office has mentioned owning a spud gun in more than one episode. * In 14th episode of Season 4 of Prison Break, a combustion potato gun is used by Michael Scofield to launch 40 mm smoke grenades. * The Simpsons character Maude Flanders was killed by air-cannon launched T-shirts in the eleventh season episode, \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\\". * In Duct Tape Forever (the movie based on The Red Green Show) Edgar K.

In 1825 the federal government acquired at the southern end of the island, and on January 1, 1827, Dutch Island Light was established to mark the west passage of Narragansett Bay and to aid vessels entering Dutch Island Harbor. The first tower was built of stones found on the island. The government constructed a new brick tower in 1857 with a fog bell added in 1878. Additional history Dutch Island is located in the West Passage of Narragansett Bay between Jamestown and Saunderstown, Rhode Island. Originally it was called \\"Quetenis\\" by the Narragansett people, who sold it to the Dutch West India Company about 1636. The Dutch from New Amsterdam (later New York) used the island as a safe place to trade their goods to the Narragansett for meat, fish and furs. Later the English settlers of Rhode Island used the island to graze sheep. For many years it was fortified to protect the West Passage from sea invasion. It is not known whether this included the Revolutionary War era when the Conanicut Battery was activated further south on the western shore of Conanicut (Jamestown) Island. Dutch Island was later heavily fortified with massive concrete gun emplacements. These were started with large granite store structures near the southern end of the island during the Civil War. In the late 19th century there was a battery of Rodman guns (25-ton cannon which used a 50-pound charge of black powder to fire a 300-pound cannonball as far as ) on the point at the southern end of the island. In the late 1890s the Army established Fort Greble on Dutch Island. Fort Greble was an Endicott-era coastal fortification which featured long-range rifled artillery pieces and could house as many as 495 officers and men. Fort Greble was an active post until 1924 and was used for National Guard training up to World War II. In 1825, the U.S. government bought on the southern tip of the island with the purpose of establishing a \\"light station\\". The first tower was built in 1826 using native stone from the island. It was tall. One of the first keepers was Robert Dennis, whose father had fought in the Revolution and who was also present at the Boston Tea Party. Dennis was 78 years old when he became keeper and apparently remained keeper until he was well into his nineties. His son, Robert, took his position when his father died. According to Jeremy D'Entremont, a member of the American Lighthouse Foundation and the first Board of Directors of the Dutch Island Lighthouse Society, the lighthouse and keeper's house were described in the mid-19th century as \\"the worst construction of any in the state\\", and the lantern was described as \\"wretched\\". In 1857, the old tower and the Keeper's House were demolished and replaced by the present brick tower and a four-room Keeper's House. The basic structure of this tower was described in 2007 as still being \\"very sound\\". The cost of these two structures in the 1850s was $4,000, and included a \\"fourth- order\\" Fresnel lens and a fixed white light. In 1878, a fog bell was installed on the west side of the tower to be activated by a clockwork mechanism. In 1924, a flashing red kerosene light was installed, the lens for which was rotated by \\"…a very big weight on pulleys\\", recalls a local resident. Keepers: *William Dennis (1827–1843) *Robert H. Weeden (1843–1844) *William P. Babcock (1844–1846) *Robert Dennis (1846–1853) *Benjamin Congdon (1853–1859) *M. M. Trundy (1859–1865) *Lewis T. King (Nov. 24, 1885 to Sept. 20, 1901)ancestry.com John Paul was one of the last keepers (1929–1931), and his son Louis remembered that this father kept a vegetable garden and a flock of ducks. He said that the fishing off the rocks was \\"excellent\\" and that his father would catch \\"…a bushel of blackfish before breakfast.\\" He would buy a whole side of beef in Jamestown or Saunderstown, salt it thoroughly and keep it for prolonged use. In 1947, the light was automated and lit by electricity, as a flashing red beacon. The military left the island, and in 1950 the Keeper's House was demolished because of vandalism and because toadstools and moss were growing in the house. In 1972, the Coast Guard proposed discontinuing the light altogether. This was followed by at least 40-50 letters of protest written to the Rhode Island Department of Natural Resources and to the Coast Guard. As a result, the Coast Guard not only retained the light but even increased its intensity. Extensive vandalism, however, continued and again the proposition to discontinue the light was made in 1977. This time it was discontinued and was replaced by a flashing red buoy off the tip of the island in 1979. Dutch Island Lighthouse Society is formed The Dutch Island Lighthouse Society was born in 2000 as a Chapter of the American Lighthouse Foundation and with the objective of restoring the lighthouse and hopefully a functioning light. In May 2000, the lighthouse was visited by Dave Lombardi, Keith Fornal, Jeremy D'Entremont and Chris Powell of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (which had jurisdiction over the island). In June 2000, Ginger Hesse and Roberta Randall of the Rhode Island State Historic Preservation Office also visited the lighthouse. The building, though needing extensive repairs, was found to be basically very sound, and they named it an Historic Building. In the summer of 2001, DILS filed an application for funds for restoration and reactivation with an estimated cost of $120,000, and the application was \\"accepted\\". It took another 7 years to complete all the many details of design, planning, restoration and activation along with endless encounters with \\"red tape\\". Meanwhile, a set of by-laws was approved which established a Board of Directors. In January 2004, DILS was accepted as a non-profit organization in the state of Rhode Island. The DILS treasurer, Betty Aschman, reported that there was $16,000 from \\"big donors\\" including the Kimball Foundation, BankNewport's Community Fund, and several family foundations. There were 188 \\"small\\" donors, and on May 21, 2004, Al Potter reported that the Society had an easement agreement with the state and the necessary insurance and project agreement. On July 1, 2004, the visitors to the island included key people from the Rhode Island Department of Transportation and Keith Lescarbeau, who was the president and owner of the Abcore Restoration Company that was already at work on Plum Beach Light. By the spring of 2005, DILS negotiated a long-term lease from the DEM, which was in charge of the island for the state, including the lighthouse. In July of that year, engineering firm Vanasse Hangen and Brustlin (VHB) visited the lighthouse with Bill DeSantis of RIDOT, architect Richard Ventrone, Jr., and planner Arnold Robinson of the Newport Collaborative Architects. (Campbell Construction Co. had already had a site visit). Their charge was to come up with drawings and specifications that would get the job done and relight the light, and if possible, to stay within the $120,000 grant from RIDOT. The details of their specifications had to be cleared by the DILS Building Committee, RIDOT, the town of Jamestown, the US Coast Guard and RIDEM (Parks Department) before the Society could advertise for bids. After a short time, RIDOT gave DILS permission to advertise for bids; the Building Committee reviewed the four bids. The winning bidder was Abcore Restoration of Narragansett, which had a very good reputation and had recently completed the restoration of the Plum Beach Lighthouse, also in Narragansett Bay. Keith Lescarbeau, the president and owner of Abcore, was also well known and admired in the area. The Building Committee's choice of Abcore was approved by the Board of Directors, and on July 3, 2007, Craig Amerigian agreed to serve as the DILS Project Manager and Owner Representative. Abcore started July 25. They made a temporary landing area on the rock near the lighthouse of about 20 tires tied together and built a plywood walkway from this landing area to the lighthouse. They had a small launch with a hoist which transported all the scaffolding, ladders and supplies to the island from Jamestown. It was heartening to see the scaffolding in place and to watch the exterior gradually change from mottled brown to gleaming white with the final parging. Another detail in the rebuilding was the fabrication and testing of a solar-powered workable light, as well as chipping away all loose material on the exterior of the tower, repairing with tuck pointing, coating with a parging (tested in Newport for appropriate whiteness) and then coating with an antifungal material. The roof had to be replaced. The glass in the tower had to be replaced with double glazing. The brass window frames needed repair and replacement, and much of the walkway also needed repair and replacement. Considerable work had to be done to the inside staircase, wooden window boards were replaced with metal ones, and the door was replaced. The separate small \\"oil house\\" was cleaned out and fitted with a new roof and door, and the exterior was refinished. The grant from RIDOT specifically stated that the grant money could not be used for maintenance, nor would RIDOT or the Enhancement Program pay for maintenance. The final field report was received from the Newport Collaborative Architects on November 20, 2007. On November 17, 2007, many gathered at vantage points to see the great occasion. At the appointed time (7:00 p.m.) the \\"count-down\\" was started, the cannon fired, and founding member Shirley Sheldon pushed the button, and for the first time in 28 years Dutch Island had a flashing red light and a gleaming white lighthouse.

The park is in extent. It is located north east of the city hall. The park houses Queen's Park Arena, current home of the New Westminster Salmonbellies, a stadium, seasonal animal petting farm, spray park, tennis courts, sports fields and band shell. The name Queens Park also applies to the residential area to the southwest of the park, bounded on the northwest by 6th Avenue, on the southwest by 6th Street, on the southeast by Royal Avenue, and on the north by the park itself.  History  = 1859-1900 = Queen's Park was the first established public park in British Columbia, as New Westminster was established in 1859. Originally, the park was named 'Queen's Ravine' by Colonel Richard Clement Moody. In the 1870s, the reserve in which the park was in was split into an area for a penitentiary, asylum, and the park itself. The park was officially declared open in 1887 as a celebration of Queen Victoria's 50th year as a monarch. In 1890, an exhibition building was built which could house up to 5,000 people. The building was created for viewing of the athletic fields and race track. = 1901-1945 = The first zoo was built in the park in 1906 by the local firemen, which contained animals such as bears and cougars. The New Westminster Arena was built in 1914 with the original intention of housing horse competitions, but was transformed into an ice rink instead. During the First World War, the park was used as a training site for the Royal Expeditionary Force. The buildings were also transformed into barracks to house the soldiers in training. In 1929, there was a large fire which destroyed most of the buildings in Queen's Park, and the area was not restored until much later, due to the Great Depression. The park was later turned again into training grounds and housing for soldiers in the Westminster Regiment during the Second World War.

Considered by some a young-adult classic, Mrs. Mike was initially serialized in the Atlantic Monthly and was the March 1947 selection of the Literary Guild. It was a critical and popular success, with 27 non-US editions, and it was published as an Armed Services Edition for U.S. servicemen abroad. The work combines the landscape and hardships of the Canadian North with the love story of Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant Mike Flannigan and the young Katherine Mary O'Fallon, newly arrived from Boston, Massachusetts. Plot The novel is based on the stories of Katherine Mary O'Fallon Flannigan (1899-1954). According to her fictionalized account, in 1907 at age 16 O'Fallon travels to Calgary to visit her uncle and recover from pleurisy. There she meets and marries Mike Flannigan, a sergeant with the Royal Northwest Mounted Police, moving with him to isolated posts in the mountain and lake regions of British Columbia and northern Alberta (Lesser Slave Lake).. In the novel the Flannigans' two children die of diphtheria, and they adopt three orphaned children. Reception Feeling that her story should be made into a film, Flannigan went to Los Angeles in 1945. Although it attracted little attention, an agent felt the story might be suitable for a book and introduced her to the Freedmans. Based on a five-page outline, extended interviews and their research, they wrote a novel based on Flannigan's story. Late in life they reaffirmed that aspects of Flannigan's life were fictionalized, including her adoption of three children, and after Sgt. Flannigan's death in 1944 from a ruptured appendix Katherine Mary Flannigan left the North. According to Benedict Freedman, \\"The most important scenes—for example, when she leaves Mike and goes back to Boston—we didn't invent that. But we also didn't check her account of things.\\" A 1947 review of Mrs. Mike by RCMP member C.D. LaNauze, stationed in Grouard at the time of the story, noted a number of discrepancies. A journey allegedly requiring \\"weeks on the trail\\" was actually an \\"easy five-day journey\\", according to LaNauze; there was no diphtheria epidemic (and Grouard was served by a doctor at the time), and confirmed bachelor George Adams—not a Michael Flannigan—was the RCMP sergeant. LaNauze said, \\"Nothing in [the book] even approaches the truth\\". A film version, with Evelyn Keyes as Katherine Mary and Dick Powell as Mike, was released in 1949. Flannigan sued its producers and the Freedmans for $25,000, but the suit was dismissed because she had a legal claim against the authors only (not the producers). The Freedmans published two sequels to Mrs. Mike: The Search for Joyful in 2002 and Kathy Little Bird in 2003. Katherine Mary Flannigan married John P. Knox, and lived in Vancouver. In 1951 she published The Faith of Mrs. Kelleen, set in 1880s Ireland and based on the life of her great-aunt.Prescott, Orville, \\"Story Mingles Fact and Legend: A Widow's Fight to Vindicate Son\\". New York Times, Jan. 2, 1951 \\"\\"Having lived a life of dramatic adventure (her honeymoon was a 700-mile jaunt by dog team in the Canadian north) and having seen others write a popular novel about it, Flannigan has evidently decided that any other books about her relations might as well be written by herself.\\"\\" Flannigan died on August 8, 1954, while visiting family and friends in Calgary.New York Times, Aug. 10, 1954 obituary) \\"'Mrs. Mike' Figure dies-Katherine Mary Flannigan Was Inspiration For Bestseller\\" John Henry Crosman adapted the novel into a newspaper comic adaptation, in the 1940s.

The programme was pursued as a private venture and the resultant aircraft was intended for the export market. During the 1980s, IAI decided to embark upon the independent development of a modernised version of the IAI Kfir; reusing its airframe and pairing it with a modernised cockpit, engine, and avionics, the latter of which was to have taken advantage of the earlier work undertaken for the cancelled IAI Lavi programme. These changes were to result in greater performance, range, and air-to-air combat capabilities than the preceding Kfir. Named Nammer, the aircraft was to be offered under various different configurations, including alternative engines and radars, as well as prospective licensed production arrangements, to customers. IAI stated that they were willing to be highly flexible with the Nammer's launch customers, being open to giving them great leeway over modifying the design and incorporating their own systems as to their preferences. Development of the Nammer proceeded to the prototype stage; a single aircraft was constructed to function as a proof-of-concept prototype, demonstrating IAI's capability to successfully install and operate advanced avionics in existing airframes, in this case the Mirage III/Kfir. On 21 March 1991, the prototype performed its maiden flight. Following on from its first flight, it continued to be used for test flights for some time, demonstrating both the maturity of the concept and of the new IAI-integrated systems. While the proven delta canard configuration of the airframe had been retained, testing was focused upon the new avionics installed, which were said by IAI to make for a relatively modern fighter aircraft. However, despite the company's lengthy efforts to seek both partner companies and export customers for the Nammer, neither participants in the programme nor buyers of the finished proved to be forthcoming; as such, development of the Nammer was ultimately ceased by IAI during the early 1990s without any further examples having been constructed. Development During the 1980s, Israeli aerospace company Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), decided to embark upon the development of a private-venture fighter aircraft; as envisaged, this programme was to be principally based around the airframe of the IAI Kfir and the advanced avionics that had been developed for the cancelled IAI Lavi.Interavia 1988, p. 209. Speaking on the Nammer, Moshe Scharf, IAI's director of international military aircraft marketing stated of the reasoning behind the initiative: \\"Upgrading the existing Kfir platform will not be as cheap as building a new airframe based on the proven delta canard concept\\". By early 1988, the company had completed the preliminary design and system definition stages of the Nammer's development and had progressed onto the detail design phase. Additionally, the company had conducted early discussions with prospective customers in respect to the type. In particular, IAI was keen to form a partnership with another entity with which to carry out further development work and subsequent production on the Nammer programme. During the late 1980s, IAI had originally announced and marketed the Nammer as being an upgrade package for existing Mirage III and Mirage 5 airframes. Customers were to have been offered a choice of two basic configurations of the type, one based around re-engining the aircraft with a General Electric F404, while the other was to have retained the Mirage's SNECMA Atar engine but integrated either the Elta EL/M-2011 or EL/M-2032 fire-control radar. The first of these options was envisioned to maximise the aircraft's performance and range while the second was to have served to increase the air-to-air targeting capabilities of the Nammer. As development progressed, the Nammer came to be advertised by the company as being a new-build aircraft, featuring the EL/M-2032 radar as an integral part of the package. Reportedly, customers were able to choose their preferred engine, ranging from the General Electric F404 (or its Volvo Aero- built derivative, the RM12), the SNECMA M53, and the Pratt & Whitney PW1120, all of which being within the 18,0001b-20,0001b-thrust class. The company has claimed that the proven delta canard configuration of the airframe, when paired with new avionics and a more modern engine design, would result in a relatively modern fighter aircraft, comparable to the General Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcon or Dassault Mirage 2000, but at a cost of approximately half of the price of the latter aircraft.\\"First flight for Israel's Nammer fighter.\\" Flight International, 30 April 1991. p. 17. For development and demonstration purposes, a single prototype was constructed by the company. On 21 March 1991, this prototype perform its maiden flight. According to IAI, the concept was presented to a number of foreign air forces while seeking to secure sales of the aircraft; the company also stated that it had no intentions to proceed with production of the aircraft until orders for a minimum of 80 aircraft had been secured. It is known that in the course of these negotiations, IAI offered a high degree of customisability to prospective operators, essentially allowing for them to make a significant impact upon the Nammer's design. The company also offered various manufacturing arrangements, from constructing the Nammer at the company's existing facilities in Israel to the potential establishment of a final assembly line within a client customer's country.\\"Israel proposes p-v fighter.\\" Flight International, 6 February 1988, p. 6. During 1990, as part of a renewed sales effort, IAI offered to effectively entirely transfer production of the Nammer, along with the onboard systems and software, overseas to customers.\\"Production offer for IAI fighter.\\" Flight International, 20 March 1990. p. 20. Design The IAI Nammer was a proposed fighter aircraft, the airframe of which being derived from the earlier IAI Kfir (which was, in turn, based upon the Dassault Mirage 5).Golan 2016, p. 277. Externally, the design bore a strong resemblance to the C7 model of the Kfir; however, it could be easily distinguished by the presence of a longer nose and the lack of a dorsal airscoop at the base of the leading edge of the tailfin. Other areas of the aircraft also featured major differences from the Kfir, including in its cockpit, radar and engine. According to IAI, Nammer was to possess a maximum speed of Mach 2.2 and a 58,000ft (19,300m) stabilised ceiling. The company intended to offer the Nammer with a choice of engines — either the Mirage Ill's original Snecma Atar 9K50, or a variety of more modern powerplants, which would typically possess greater fuel-efficiency and reduced weight than the original engine. The cockpit of the Nammer was extensively modernised, includes a new overall layout which, amongst other benefits, would have permitted its pilot to maintain effective control of the aircraft via hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) operation of all of the key systems under the majority of anticipated operational circumstances. A total of four displays, comprising a head-up display, a pair of multi-function displays, and a radar warning/electronic countermeasures display, were intended to supply the pilot with all necessary information. The various displays and the solid- state instrumentation for the engine was to be based upon reused Lavi technology. The avionics were a major focus area of the Nammer's development.Copley 1988, p. 12. According to IAI, the Nammer was to be equipped with an advanced weapon management system that was directly integrated with a multimode pulse-Doppler radar, while its electronic warfare suite included features originally designed for the cancelled Lavi would also have been potentially used. The maximum take-off weight of the aircraft was approximately 15,450kg, while the maximum payload was 6,270kg. It could internally contain a total of 3,000kg of fuel, along with an additional 3,720kg in external tanks. In addition, it was to be provided with an aerial refueling capability. According to repeated statements by IAI, serial production of the Nammer fighter would have had been available at a unit cost of less than $20 million.

Fictional character biography The being is outside of the Presence's creation. It is the soul of darkness itself, a complete absence of divine light. In every way equal to the power of the Presence, it is his opposite who existed before Creation. After the Crisis on Infinite Earths, a group of mystic madmen of the Brujería cult attempted to conduct a mystic ritual to contact the Great Evil Beast; it went awry and instead the entity awoke as a furious monster, unknowing of its own power and confused about its existence. It encountered a number of mystical heroes (Etrigan, Doctor Fate, the Spectre), who unwittingly angered the being and directed it against Heaven, leaving the defeated heroes behind. They did this unknowingly, despite their best intentions; Etrigan taught it that darkness was evil, Dr. Fate told him that evil was despicable, and the Spectre taught it the concept of revenge. Infuriated, the being sought to assault Heaven to demand answers from the Presence as to its existence, trampling all that it crossed paths with. This power was so huge, it caused Hell's main three figures - Lucifer, Azazel and Beelzebub - to form a triumvirate in order to defend themselves should the Great Evil Beast decide that it wanted Hell as its realm. A different faction, led by the Demons Three, banded together to follow the Great Evil Beast, whom they saw as the ultimate sin and the ultimate evil. However, before the Great Evil Beast reached the gates of the Silver City of Heaven, it encountered the Swamp Thing, who taught it the concept of good and evil, life and death, intertwined so that one could not survive without the other. The Great Evil Beast then extended its hand, and something happened that nobody had foreseen; the Presence extended His. When both hands shook, they both vanished as the light from a Yin/Yang symbol appeared. The Phantom Stranger later notes that their conflict hadn’t simply gone away, but that it had been altered and they’re both still locked in battle against each other The realm of the Great Evil Beast, an expanse of complete and utter darkness known as the Sunless Sea or the Shadowlands, has been referred to as the power source for shadow-manipulating characters such as the Shade (Richard Swift), his archenemy Simon Culp, the Shadow Thief, Nightshade, Ian Karkull, and Alan Scott's son Obsidian. It is also known as the source of all magic in the DC Universe. In other media In the television series Constantine, archangel Manny (Harold Perrineau) warns John Constantine (Matt Ryan) that the Brujería plan to unleash an ancient evil known as the \\"Rising Darkness\\" to the human realm. According to Papa Midnite (Michael James Shaw), this darkness will be unleashed when someone very close to Constantine betrays him in the future. At the end of the last episode, \\"Waiting for the Man\\", Manny releases Midnite from police custody and reveals that the Brujería works for him, which makes Manny the real mastermind behind the event of the story. Whether the Rising Darkness is a reference to the Great Evil Beast remains unknown.

It has developed in parallel with DNA testing technologies capable of identifying genetic similarities and differences between both modern and ancient populations. The conclusions of population genetics regarding the British Isles in turn draw upon and contribute to the larger field of understanding the history of the human occupation of the area, complementing work in linguistics, archaeology, history and genealogy. Research concerning the most important routes of migration into the British Isles is the subject of debate. Apart from the most obvious route across the narrowest point of the English Channel into Kent, other routes may have been important over the millennia, including a land bridge in the Mesolithic period, as well as maritime connections along the Atlantic coasts. The periods of the most important migrations are contested. The Neolithic introduction of farming technologies from Europe is frequently proposed as a period of major change in the British Isles. Such technology could either have been learned by locals from a small number of immigrants or by colonists who significantly changed the population. Other potentially important historical periods of migration which have been subject to consideration in this field include the introduction of Celtic languages and technologies (during the Bronze and Iron Ages), the Roman era, the period of Anglo-Saxon influx, the Viking era, the Norman invasion of 1066 and the era of the European wars of religion. There has also been significant movement between different parts of the British Isles. History of research Early studies by Luigi Cavalli-Sforza used polymorphisms from proteins found within human blood (such as the ABO blood groups, Rhesus blood antigens, HLA loci, immunoglobulins, G6PD isoenzymes, amongst others). One of the lasting proposals of this study with regards to Europe is that within most of the continent, the majority of genetic diversity may best be explained by immigration coming from the southeast towards the northwest or in other words from the Middle East towards Britain and Ireland. Cavalli-Sforza proposed at the time that the invention of agriculture might be the best explanation for this. With the advent of DNA analysis, modern populations were sampled for mitochondrial DNA to study the female line of descent, and Y chromosome DNA to study male descent. As opposed to large scale sampling within the autosomal DNA, Y DNA and mitochondrial DNA represent specific types of genetic descent and can therefore reflect only particular aspects of past human movement. Later projects began to use autosomal DNA to gather a more complete picture of an individual's genome. For Britain, major research projects aimed at collecting data include the Oxford Genetic Atlas Project (OGAP) and more recently the People of the British Isles, also associated with Oxford. Due to the difficulty in modelling the contributions of historical migration events to modern populations based purely on modern genetic data, such studies often varied significantly in their conclusions. One early Y DNA study estimated a complete genetic replacement by the Anglo-Saxons, while another argued that it was impossible to distinguish between the contributions of the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings, and that the contribution of the latter may even have been higher. A third study argued that there was no Viking influence on British populations at all outside of Orkney.Leslie, S., Winney, B., Hellenthal, G. et al. The fine-scale genetic structure of the British population. Nature 519, 309–314 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14230 Stephen Oppenheimer and Bryan Sykes, meanwhile, claimed that the majority of the DNA in the British isles had originated from a prehistoric migration from the Iberian peninsula, and that subsequent invasions had had little genetic input. In the last decade, improved technologies for extracting ancient DNA have allowed researchers to study the genetic impacts of these migrations in more detail. This led to Oppenheimer and Sykes' conclusions about the origins of the British being seriously challenged, as later research demonstrated that the majority of the DNA of much of continental Europe, including Britain and Ireland, is ultimately derived from Steppe invaders from the east rather than Iberia.; This research has also suggested that subsequent migrations, such as that of the Anglo-Saxons, did have large genetic effects (though these effects varied from place to place).Martiniano, R., Caffell, A., Holst, M. et al. Genomic signals of migration and continuity in Britain before the Anglo- Saxons. Nat Commun 7, 10326 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10326Schiffels, S. et al. (2016) Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon genomes from East England reveal British migration history, Nature Communications 7, Article number:10408 doi:10.1038/ncomms10408 Analyses of nuclear and ancient DNA =Mesolithic population= Mesolithic Britons were closely related to other Mesolithic people throughout Western Europe. This population probably had pale-coloured eyes, lactose intolerance, dark curly or wavy hair and very dark or black skin. Supplementary Material (p.18, on Cheddar Man): \\"This individual has light or blue/green eye colour, it is not light blue, there are elements of brown/yellow in the eye to give a proposed perceived green colour. Better coverage at the low sequenced marker would clarify this but blue/hazel cannot be ruled out. It is certainly not a brown eyed or clear blue-eyed individual... Skin pigmentation [assumptions about missing information omitted] The following range for skin pigmentation prediction is possible for this individual with these parameters:... Dark 0.209 - 0.435 Dark-Black 0.749 - 0.36 Final prediction: Dark/Dark-to-Black skin Explanation: The combined effect of probabilities in the dark and dark- to-black colour categories provide an indication that the individual has darkly pigmented skin, it is unlikely that this individual has the darkest possible skin pigmentation, but it cannot be ruled out as the missing SNP does influence that detail, but certainly skin pigmentation is dark in complexion.\\"; =Continental Neolithic farmers= Mesolithic Britons were closely related to other Mesolithic people throughout Europe, but Neolithic individuals are close to Iberian and Central European Middle Neolithic populations, modelled as having about 75% ancestry from Anatolian farmers with the rest coming from Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHG) in continental Europe. Some British Neolithic individuals had slightly (about 10%) more WHG genes, suggesting that some members of the WHG population in Britain did pass on their genes. Neolithic individuals from Wales have no detectable local admixture of Western hunter-gatherer genes, those from South East England and Scotland show the highest admixture of WHG genes, and those from South-West and Central England are intermediate. This suggests that farming was brought to the British Isles by sea from north-west mainland Europe, by a population that was, or became in succeeding generations, relatively large. =Bronze Age European Bell Beaker People= According to a 2017 study, the spread of the Bell Beaker culture to Britain from the lower Rhine area in the early Bronze Age introduced high levels of steppe-related ancestry, resulting in a near- complete transformation of the local gene pool within a few centuries, replacing about 90% of the local Neolithic-derived lineages between 2,400 BC and 2,000 BC. These people exhibiting the Beaker culture were likely an offshoot of the Corded Ware culture, as they had little genetic affinity to the Iberian Beaker people.http://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2019/01/dutch-beakers- like-no-other-beakers.html; In addition to the large steppe-derived component, they had a smaller proportion of continental Neolithic and Western Hunter Gatherer DNA. The Modern British and Irish likely derive most of their ancestry from this Beaker culture population. According to geneticist David Reich, the southern parts of Britain saw an increase in Neolithic DNA around the Iron Age to Roman Period, which may be attributable a resurgence of the native Neolithic-derived population, or to Celtic Iron Age or Roman period migrations. An earlier study had estimated that the modern English population derived somewhat just over half of their ancestry from a combination of Neolithic and Western Hunter Gatherer ancestry, with the steppe-derived (Yamnaya-like) element making up the remainder. Scotland was found to have both more Steppe and more Western Hunter Gatherer ancestry than England. These proportions are similar to other Northwest European populations. =Anglo- Saxons= Researchers have used ancient DNA to determine the nature of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, as well as its impact on modern populations in the British Isles. One 2016 study, using Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon era DNA found at grave sites in Cambridgeshire, calculated that ten modern day eastern English samples had 38% Anglo-Saxon ancestry on average, while ten Welsh and Scottish samples each had 30% Anglo-Saxon ancestry, with a large statistical spread in all cases. However, the authors noted that the similarity observed between the various sample groups was possibly due to more recent internal migration.Schiffels, S. et al. (2016) Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon genomes from East England reveal British migration history, Nature Communications 7, Article number:10408 doi:10.1038/ncomms10408 Another 2016 study conducted using evidence from burials found in northern England, found that a significant genetic difference was present in bodies from the Iron Age and the Roman period on the one hand, and the Anglo-Saxon period on the other. Samples from modern-day Wales were found to be similar to those from the Iron Age and Roman burials, while samples from much of modern England, East Anglia in particular, were closer to the Anglo-Saxon-era burial. This was found to demonstrate a \\"profound impact\\" from the Anglo-Saxon migrations on the modern English gene pool, though no specific percentages were given in the study.Martiniano, R., Caffell, A., Holst, M. et al. Genomic signals of migration and continuity in Britain before the Anglo-Saxons. Nat Commun 7, 10326 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10326 A third study combined the ancient data from both of the preceding studies and compared it to a large number of modern samples from across Britain and Ireland. This study concluded that modern southern, central and eastern English populations were of \\"a predominantly Anglo-Saxon-like ancestry\\" while those from northern and southwestern England had a greater degree of indigenous origin.Ross P. Byrne, Rui Martiniano, Lara M. Cassidy, Matthew Carrigan, Garrett Hellenthal, Orla Hardiman, Daniel G. Bradley, Russell McLaughlin: \\"Insular Celtic population structure and genomic footprints of migration\\" (2018) =Vikings= Historical and toponymic evidence suggests a substantial Viking migration to many parts of northern Britain; however, particularly in the case of the Danish settlers, differentiating their genetic contribution to modern populations from that of the Anglo-Saxons has posed difficulties. A study published in 2020, which used ancient DNA from across the Viking world in addition to modern data, noted that ancient samples from Denmark showed similarities with samples from both modern Denmark and modern England. While most of this similarity was attributed to the earlier settlement of the Anglo-Saxons, the authors of the study noted that British populations also carried a small amount of \\"Swedish- like\\" ancestry that was present in the Danish Vikings but unlikely to have been associated with the Anglo-Saxons. From this, it was calculated that the modern English population has approximately 6% Danish Viking ancestry, with Scottish and Irish populations having up to 16%. Additionally, populations from all areas of Britain and Ireland were found to have 3-4% Norwegian Viking ancestry.Margaryan, A., Lawson, D.J., Sikora, M. et al. Population genomics of the Viking world. Nature 585, 390–396 (2020). (See supplemental note 11) =Irish populations= A 2015 study using data from the Neolithic and Bronze ages showed a considerable genetic difference between individuals during the two periods, which were interpreted as being the result of a migration from the Pontic steppes. The individuals from the latter period, with significant steppe ancestry, showed strong similarities to modern Irish population groups. The study concluded that \\"these findings together suggest the establishment of central aspects of the Irish genome 4,000 years ago.\\"Lara M. Cassidy, Rui Martiniano, Eileen M. Murphy, Matthew D. Teasdale, James Mallory, Barrie Hartwell, and Daniel G. Bradley, \\"Neolithic and Bronze Age migration to Ireland and establishment of the insular Atlantic genome,\\" PNAS January 12, 2016 113 (2) 368-373; first published December 28, 2015 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1518445113 Another study, using modern autosomal data, found a large degree of genetic similarity between populations from northeastern Ireland, southern Scotland and Cumbria. This was interpreted as reflecting the legacy of the Plantation of Ulster in the 17th century.Ross P. Byrne, Rui Martiniano, Lara M. Cassidy, Matthew Carrigan, Garrett Hellenthal, Orla Hardiman, Daniel G. Bradley, and Russell L. McLaughlin, \\"Insular Celtic population structure and genomic footprints of migration,\\" January 25, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007152 Haplogroups =Mitochondrial DNA= Bryan Sykes broke mitochondrial results into twelve haplogroups for various regions of the isles: *Haplogroup H *Haplogroup I *Haplogroup J *Haplogroup T *Haplogroup V *Haplogroup W *Haplogroup X *Haplogroup U ...and within U... :*Haplogroup U2 :*Haplogroup U3 :*Haplogroup U4 :*Haplogroup U5 Sykes found that the maternal haplogroup pattern was similar throughout England but with a distinct trend from east and north to west and south. Minor haplogroups were mainly found in the east of England. Sykes found Haplogroup H to be dominant in Ireland and Wales, though a few differences were found between north, mid and south Wales--there was a closer link between north and mid Wales than either had with the south. Studies of ancient DNA have demonstrated that ancient Britons and Anglo-Saxon settlers carried a variety of mtDNA haplogroups, though type H was common in both.Schiffels, S. and Sayer, D. (2017) \\"Investigating Anglo-Saxon migration history with ancient and modern DNA,\\" H.H. Meller, F. Daim, J. Frause and R. Risch (eds) Migration and Integration form Prehisory to the Middle Ages. Tagungen Des Landesmuseums Für Vorgeschichte Halle, Saale =Y chromosome DNA= Sykes also designated five main Y-DNA haplogroups for various regions of Britain and Ireland. *Haplogroup R1b *Haplogroup R1a *Haplogroup I *Haplogroup E1b1b *Haplogroup J Haplogroup R1b is dominant throughout Western Europe. While it was once seen as a lineage connecting the Britain and Ireland to Iberia, where it is also common, it is now believed that both R1b and R1a entered Europe with Indo-European migrants likely originating around the Black Sea; R1a and R1b are now the most common haplotypes in Europe. One common R1b subclade in Britain is R1b-U106, which reaches its highest frequencies in North Sea areas such as southern and eastern England, the Netherlands and Denmark. Due to its distribution, this subclade is often associated with the Anglo-Saxon migrations. Ancient DNA has shown that it was also present in Roman Britain, possibly among descendants of Germanic mercenaries.Schiffels, S. and Sayer, D. (2017) \\"Investigating Anglo- Saxon migration history with ancient and modern DNA,\\" H.H. Meller, F. Daim, J. Frause and R. Risch (eds) Migration and Integration form Prehisory to the Middle Ages. Tagungen Des Landesmuseums Für Vorgeschichte Halle, Saale Ireland, Scotland, Wales and northwestern England are dominated by R1b-L21, which is also found in north western France, the north coast of Spain, and western Norway.; ; This lineage is often associated with the historic Celts, as most of the regions where it is predominant have had a significant Celtic language presence into the modern period and associate with a Celtic cultural identity in the present day.Joe Flood, \\"The phylogenealogy of R-L21: four and a half millennia of expansion and redistribution\\" It was also present among Celtic Britons in eastern England prior to the Anglo-Saxon and Viking invasions, as well as Roman soldiers in York who were of native descent.Schiffels, S. and Sayer, D. (2017) \\"Investigating Anglo-Saxon migration history with ancient and modern DNA,\\" H.H. Meller, F. Daim, J. Frause and R. Risch (eds) Migration and Integration form Prehisory to the Middle Ages. Tagungen Des Landesmuseums Für Vorgeschichte Halle, Saale There are various smaller and geographically well-defined Y-DNA Haplogroups under R1b in Western Europe. Haplogroup R1a, a distant cousin of R1b, is most common in Eastern Europe. In Britain it has been linked to Scandinavian immigration during periods of Viking settlement. 25% of men in Norway belong to this haplogroup; it is much more common in Norway than the rest of Scandinavia. Around 9% of all Scottish men belong to the Norwegian R1a subclade, which peaks at over 30% in Shetland and Orkney. However, there is no conclusive evidence that all came with Vikings, and similarities could have arisen from similar pre-Viking settlement patterns. Current Scandinavians belong to a range of haplogroups. Haplogroup I is a grouping of several quite distantly related lineages. Within Britain, the most common subclade is I1, which also occurs frequently in northwestern continental Europe and southern Scandinavia, and has thus been associated with the settlement of the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings. An Anglo-Saxon male from northern England who died between the seventh and tenth centuries was determined to have belonged to haplogroup I1.Martiniano, R., Caffell, A., Holst, M. et al. Genomic signals of migration and continuity in Britain before the Anglo-Saxons. Nat Commun 7, 10326 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10326 Haplogroups E1b1b and J in Europe are regarded as markers of Neolithic movements from the Middle East to Southern Europe and likely to Northern Europe from there. These haplogroups are found most often in Southern Europe and North Africa. Both are rare in Northern Europe; E1b1b is found in 1% of Norwegian men, 1.5% of Scottish, 2% of English, 2.5% of Danish, 3% of Swedish and 5.5% of German. It reaches its peak in Europe in Kosovo at 47.5% and Greece at 30%. =Uncommon Y haplogroups= Geneticists have found that seven men with the surname Revis, which originates in Yorkshire, carry a genetic signature previously found only in people of West African origin. All of the men belonged to Haplogroup A1a (M31), a subclade of Haplogroup A which geneticists believe originated in Eastern or Southern Africa. The men are not regarded as phenotypically African and there are no documents, anecdotal evidence or oral traditions suggesting that the Revis family has African ancestry. It has been conjectured that the presence of this haplogroup may date from the Roman era, when both Africans and Romans of African descent are known to have settled in Britain. According to Bryan Sykes, \\"although the Romans ruled from AD 43 until 410, they left a tiny genetic footprint.\\" The genetics of some visibly white (European) people in England suggests that they are \\"descended from north African, Middle Eastern and Roman clans\\". Geneticists have shown that former American president Thomas Jefferson, who might have been of Welsh descent, along with two other British men of the 85 British men with the surname Jefferson, carry the rare Y chromosome marker T. This is typically found in East Africa and the Middle East. It is also found in 4.5% of Greek men, 3.5% of Estonian, and 2.5% of Spanish and Italian men, also scattered across the Alps. There have been no other documented cases of Haplogroup T occurring in Northern Europe other than those two cases. The presence of scattered and diverse European haplotypes within the network is nonetheless consistent with Jefferson's patrilineage belonging to an ancient and rare indigenous European type.

The law also establishes a new executive branch office, the Office of the United States Intellectual Property Enforcement Representative (USIPER).Congress' copyright reform: seize computers, boost penalties, spend money Background The PRO-IP Act would serve to further protect rights holders in the case of secondary infringement, in which a consumer becomes liable for infringement committed by another. In Capitol Records v. Deborah Foster (2004), the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) could not charge Oklahoma woman, Debbie Foster, with infringement of shared files. Judge Lee suggested that Foster could not be held responsible for the download of files, which were attributed to her adult daughter and estranged husband who used her IP number. The RIAA's use of IP numbers to charge users with infringement was not sufficient evidence to charge Ms. Foster and other defendants in the past. However, in another RIAA case, Elektra v. Santangelo, the judge did find Patti Santangelo potentially liable for file-sharing in her home via Kazaa software, despite the fact that she may not have been aware of the illegal downloads. In one case, Capitol v. Thomas, Capitol Records did receive an award of $9,250 in statutory damages for each of the twenty-four infringed songs. Although the jury settled on charging the defendant with only $9,250 out of the possible $150,000 per song, through these cases, Capitol Records, the RIAA and others were primarily concerned with sending a message to the public that illegal distribution and download of copyrighted music was unacceptable. In addition to these domestic issues, United States has a history of participating in global enforcement of intellectual property rights. In 1995, the U.S. participated in negotiating in the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which established a minimum standard for protecting various areas of IP rights. Throughout fiscal years 2004 to 2009, the government has tracked the importation of counterfeit goods, including pharmaceuticals, cigarettes, apparel, footwear, computers, software, toys and electronics. In 2006, the government confiscated, for example, cargo containers of counterfeit Nike Air Jordan shoes, as well as counterfeit Abercrombie and Fitch clothing, which together were valued at about $19 million. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office's April 2010 report, \\"Observations on the Efforts to Quantify the Economic Effects of Counterfeit and Pirated Goods,\\" such goods undercut American competition with lower prices, thus causing damage to the domestic economy. The U.S. government was also strongly concerned about the illicit distribution of digital products through peer-to-peer networks, streaming sites, and one-click hosting services. At the time, there was no government agency that collected or tracked data on digital copyright violation. Alongside potential lost revenue, these unauthorized goods pressure producers and IP owners to compete with the counterfeit producers. Overall, this contributes to loss of brand value and reputation, as well as lost investment and innovation. Also, American companies are forced to expend further funds on protecting intellectual property in court. Proponents of PRO-IP frequently cited a study from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, claiming that intellectual property theft costs American businesses an estimated $250 billion each year, as well as an estimated 750,000 jobs. A subsequent investigation by the technology news site Ars Technica revealed that these statistics were both inaccurate and decades old. A report issued by the Government Accountability Office in 2010 confirmed that these figures had not been derived from any reliable research, and could not be substantiated. Legislative history The origin of the legislation was the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act, S.1984 introduced on November 9, 2005, in 109th Congress https://www.congress.gov/109/bills/s1984/BILLS-109s1984is.pdf by Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN) and Senator George Voinovich (R-OH), and re-introduced on February 7, 2007, in the 110th Congress as S.522.https://www.congress.gov/110/bills/s522/BILLS-110s522is.pdf S.522 required the President to appoint an Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, who would serve in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the Executive Office of the President. The Coordinator would be responsible for coordinating inter agency activity on IP enforcement, developing a Strategic Plan detailing objectives and strategies, working with the private sector and other outside groups, and reporting to the President and Congress. New provisions were added later that year. On December 5, 2007, John Conyers (D-MI) introduced the newly expanded legislation into the House of Representatives. The bill (H.R. 4279) was known as Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property (PRO-IP) Act of 2008. Lamar Smith (R-TX), Howard Berman (D-CA), Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) were among the sponsors of the bill. Intellectual-property holders, such as entertainment companies, auto parts manufacturers, pharmaceuticals and unions, championed the bill. On May 8, 2008, the House of Representatives passed the bill 410 to 11. Only 12 representatives did not vote. On July 12, 2008, H.R. 4279 was received in the House and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. On July 24, 2008, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the bill (S.3325) in the Senate as Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Act. On September 26, 2008, S.3325 passed in the Senate with unanimous consent. Two days later, S.3325 passed in the House 381 to 41. In this final House vote, 2008 Presidential candidates, Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich, voted against the bill. On October 13, 2008, President George W. Bush signed the bill into law. The official name of the bill reverted to its original title when it was introduced into the House, Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Act. Content The PRO-IP Act makes changes to prior intellectual property law in the areas of civil enforcement, criminal enforcement, coordination of federal intellectual property efforts and funding and resources of the Department of Justice intellectual property programs. For civil enforcement, the PRO-IP Act increases the maximum $30,000 penalty for compilations and increases penalties for repeat offenders. It raises the penalty for statutory damages for counterfeit goods from $1,000 to $200,000, which was originally a range from $500 to $100,000. For repeat offenders, the maximum statutory damages range from $1–2 million. In addition, the Justice Department has the authority to conduct civil asset forfeiture, in which any computer or network hardware used in the act of a copyright crime may be seized and auctioned off. In civil forfeiture, the plaintiff may also access bank accounts, financial information and other documents in order to trace the source of the infringing goods. In criminal enforcement, the PRO-IP Act offers the government more authority in seizure and forfeiture in the trafficking of counterfeit labels, documentation, and packaging. Under Title II of the Act, the manufacturers of these products face new criminal penalties, especially if the offender knowingly or recklessly causes serious bodily injury or death, as with counterfeit pharmaceuticals. The Act also prohibits the transshipment or exportation of such goods, which would be in violation of the Trademark Act of 1946 or the Lanham Act. Section 602 of the Copyright Act states that it is only illegal to import products that infringe a copyright. Section 105 of PRO- IP makes exports of such materials illegal as well. U.S. Customs and Border Protection also provides the opportunity for musicians and performers to register their work with the agency, enabling CBP to notify the artist if unauthorized copies of their work are tracked entering the U.S. from other countries. The PRO-IP Act also established the position of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator within the Executive Office of the President. The purpose of this new position was to coordinate the anti-infringement efforts of the Department of Justice, the Patent and Trademark Office and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The appointed IPEC would be responsible for developing and implementing a Joint Strategic Plan, a program to battle counterfeiting and copyright infringement. The appointee would also serve as chief advisor to the President on both domestic and international intellectual property enforcement policy. Under Section 304, the IPEC must submit an annual report to Congress and must update the strategic plan every three years. The legislation also allocates $25 million annually to state and local governments to train law enforcement, educate the public and purchase technology to combat counterfeit activity. Additional resources, for example, were allotted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which now operates a department of at least five full-time Special Agents who work with the Department of Justice's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS). The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the federal budget would allocate approximately $429 million between 2009 and 2013 for the implementation of the PRO-IP Act. Proponents and opponents =Proponents= Based on the White House's 2010 Joint Strategic Plan, proponents stated that the PRO-IP Act would protect the growth of the national economy. They believed it would promote creativity, research and innovation, which are essential to the technology, pharmaceutical, automobile, and entertainment industries and in turn, protect the jobs in those fields. The U.S. federal government also depends on the promotion of innovation to solve global problems and to preserve national and economic security, including the prevention of criminal activity, such as the sale of counterfeit drugs that cause fatal harm to consumers. In addition, supporters said the Act reaffirmed Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, which aims to promote scientific and artistic creativity. In a speech at the Export-Import Bank's Annual Conference in March 2010, President Obama remarked: \\"...we're going to aggressively protect our intellectual property. Our single greatest asset is the innovation and the ingenuity and creativity of the American people. It is essential to our prosperity and it will only become more so in this century. But it's only a competitive advantage if our companies know that someone else can't just steal that idea and duplicate it with cheaper inputs and labor. There's nothing wrong with other people using our technologies, we welcome it –- we just want to make sure that it's licensed, and that American businesses are getting paid appropriately.\\" When the bill was initially introduced, co- sponsor, Rep. Howard Berman, defended the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. He suggested that individuals are willing to steal intellectual property and that the PRO-IP Act would prevent such crimes. American businesses, such as the Business Software Alliance, Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry of Association of America, were long time supporters of the bill, since it was first introduced into the House. NBCUniversal Media also supported the Act due to countless unlicensed works on counterfeit DVDs and online, which were circulated throughout the U.S. and abroad. In response to the changing Internet platforms, corporations like NBC have transformed traditional media companies into new models to monetize their content. Hulu, for example, began as a joint venture between NBC and News Corp, parent company to Fox. Although new resources were provided for consuming entertainment media, it was not sufficient to completely counteract copyright infringement online. In addition to media and entertainment corporations, the U.S. auto industry, including General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, sought protection from counterfeiters. Ford and GM, who hold one third of all green technology patents and their related value, are in competition with China and India in the development of hybrid and green technology. Proponents in the auto industry suggested that the PRO-IP Act was essential to sustain financial viability, as well as enduring competitiveness. Other groups that supported the Act include the National Music Publishers' Association and the Copyright Alliance. =Opponents= Compilation clause However, the PRO-IP Act also faced opposition. Before the act was passed, Library Copyright Alliance (LCA), Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), Net Coalition, Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), Public Knowledge, Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), Association of Public Television Stations and Printing Industries of America, protested the compilation clause. Under the law at the time, the copyright plaintiff was able to obtain up to $150,000 per work infringed. The compilation clause, from Section 504 (c)(1) of Title 17, states: \\"For the purposes of this subsection, all the parts of a compilation or derivative work constitute one work.\\" Under the clause, an entire stolen album would count as one work and thus, the infringer would receive a maximum penalty of $150,000. This would mean, for example, that an individual who copied fifty songs from a boxed set would be liable for a maximum $150,000 rather than $7.5 million in damages. Under the PRO-IP Act, however, legislators proposed that the plaintiff could claim up to $150,000 per infringed work. Public Knowledge argued that this proposed change to the compilation clause would \\"incentivize 'copyright trolls'\\" to collect larger damage claims than necessary. William Patry, senior copyright lawyer for Google, was well known for calling the legislation, the most \\"outrageous gluttonous IP bill ever introduced in the U.S.,\\" in response to the compilation clause. Patry, who served in the Copyright Office in the past, suggested that the penalties of the PRO-IP Act would fall on ordinary Americans, not commercial counterfeiters. Like Patry, many believed that liability per song was an excessive penalty. Digital rights groups and other critics suggested that the Act failed to recognize the difference between commercial counterfeiters and regular consumers, who would be punished with outstanding fees. In fact, they suggested that non commercial, personal copying of such tracks could possibly be considered fair use. The PRO-IP Act further narrows rights under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Under DMCA, fair use limits the statutory damages available under secondary liability and permits bypassing digital rights management (DRM) for lawful uses. Consumer advocates suggested that the PRO-IP Act, in turn, would serve as a means to protect the business interests of American film, music and software companies. \\"At a time when the entire digital world is going to less restrictive distribution models, and when the courts are aghast at the outlandish damages being inflicted on consumers in copyright cases, this bill goes entirely in the wrong direction,\\" stated Public Knowledge's president and co-founder, Gigi Sohn. Due to this controversy, the compilation clause was ultimately removed from the Act. Attempted infringement clause Another contested clause was the \\"attempted infringement\\" penalty. Section 506 (a)(1) of Title 17 states that \\"any person who willfully infringes a copyright shall be punished...if the infringement was committed—(A) for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain; (B) by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means...copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000; or (C) by the distribution of a work being prepared for commercial distribution, by making it available on a computer network accessible to members of the public...\\" Under this section, Representative Steve Chabot (R-OH) had proposed that the PRO-IP Act enact stricter penalties, which would lengthen prison terms. Consumer rights In addition, American consumers were concerned about Section 206, which expanded the scope of civil forfeitures. The government could confiscate an iPod, for example, that contained a single illegal music download, as the device can be said to be property which \\"facilitates\\" infringement. Others claimed that the Act was a violation of net neutrality. As a result of the legislation, Internet service providers would partner with recording companies, for example, in order to detect copyright infringement. The legislation would also permit the Attorney General to sue individuals on behalf of rights holders, like the MPAA and RIAA. Advocacy groups, like Public Knowledge and Electronic Frontier Foundation stated that the recording industry has threatened or filed over 30,000 lawsuits against individual consumers, suggesting that movie and television producers, software publishers, music publishers and print publishers have sufficient access to their own enforcement programs and do not need additional support from the government. In addition, the PRO-IP Act was also criticized due to the creation of new federal offices that would further strain taxpayer dollars, such as the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Representative, Intellectual Property Enforcement Division in the Department of Justice and additional intellectual property staff in U.S. embassies. Implementation =Bush Administration= In September 1999, Congress instituted the National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordination Center to coordinate efforts to protect IP across federal agencies. In 2004, the Strategy for Targeting Organized Piracy (STOP) was also established in response to rising industry concerns about copyright violation. However, the functions of these agencies overlapped and lacked an overall strategy. On October 8, 2008, President Bush had signed the bailout bill, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Proponents said that PRO-IP would help the country during the economic crisis.. According to co-sponsor, Senator Patrick Leahy, the legislation would serve as a means to protect copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets central to the U.S. economy and its job market. \\"Intellectual property—copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets—is an ever-growing sector of our economy. We are the envy of the world for the quality and the quantity of our innovative and creative goods and services. If we want to continue to lead the world in producing intellectual property, we need to protect Americans' rights in that property\\", stated Senator Leahy. The Bush Administration had questioned the legality of the \\"copyright czar\\" position, suggesting that it was a violation of separation of powers. The Justice Department was opposed to the bill, suggesting that the power of the appointed copyright czar was unnecessary. As a result, the position was placed in the Executive Office of the President instead of the Department of Justice. Senator Ron Wyden was one of the representatives who requested that Congress remove the provision that requires the involvement of the Department of Justice in intellectual property enforcement. =Obama Administration= In September 2009, President Barack Obama appointed intellectual property scholar Victoria Espinel to be the first Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, a position informally known as the Copyright Czar. Victoria Espinel, who taught as a professor at George Mason University, had prior experience working at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Espinel also served as an intellectual property advisor to the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Senate Finance Committee, the House Judiciary Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. On December 3, 2009, Espinel's appointment was confirmed. The United States Chamber of Commerce, Public Knowledge and other groups approved Espinel for this position. By Executive Order, President Obama also created two interagencies, the Senior Advisory Committee and Intellectual Property Enforcement Advisory Committee. Espinel serves as the chair of these two groups. Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) was a strong supporter of these committees, which aimed to further support the goals of the PRO-IP Act, centered upon protecting American intellectual property and in turn, protect innovation central to the U.S. economy and its job market. In 2009, the Justice Department reported on the implementation of PRO-IP Act in its first year. There were a variety of prosecutions in the protection of health and safety. One defendant was imprisoned for trafficking over $400,000 worth of counterfeit pharmaceuticals. These tablets, when consumed with alcohol, caused symptoms such as abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting and headaches. In another case, a New York resident was incarcerated for trafficking more than a half a million tubes of counterfeit toothpaste, which contained microorganisms and diethylene glycol, a chemical used as a coolant in brake fluids. The most severe of these prosecutions included imprisonment for Kevin Xu of Texas, who trafficked counterfeit cancer drugs, which included less active ingredients than indicated on the labels. The ability to seize these counterfeit products enabled the government to protect citizen health. In commercial counterfeiting online, the Department of Justice reported the operation of forty websites that generated $800,000 selling counterfeit software online. A ring of defendants was also guilty of selling counterfeit software on eBay valued at more than $25 million. Over the course of about six years, another defendant sold unlicensed tele-radiological software to hospitals and outpatient facilities. The Department of Justice also reported that the FBI was able to target counterfeiting organizations, as well as initiate the first-ever peer- to-peer trial conviction. Apocalypse Production Crew or \\"APC\\" was one of these unauthorized music distribution groups that served as a \\"release group,\\" which are the original sources in which infringed works are distributed on the Internet. In the first peer-to-peer trial conviction, Daniel Dove was convicted as the administrator of Elite Torrents, a P2P Internet release group, which had over 133,000 members and facilitated the distribution of more than 17,800 titles in movies, software, music and games. In 2010, the Justice Department's Criminal Division also coordinated work between investigatory agencies and the International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center, also referred to as IOC-2. In an attempt to close intelligence gaps between these groups, the FBI, ICE and CBP routinely contribute intellectual property data to IOC-2. The IOC-2 has also collaborated with the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center to train personnel in the identification of intellectual property violations that involve organized crime. In addition, in 2010, operations detected online infringement in the sale of counterfeit clothing and computer programs. At the Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, California, merchants at eight shops were charged with trafficking counterfeit designer merchandise imported from China, such as clothing, handbags and shoes, all of which were valued over $100 million. In New York, a man had been trafficking NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB sports jerseys. The FBI was also able to track organized crime internationally, such as one group that was responsible for smuggling 120 pairs of counterfeit Nike shoes, 500,000 counterfeit Coach handbags, 10,000 pairs of Coach and Gucci shoes and 500 counterfeit Cartier watches through the Port of Baltimore. The PRO-IP Act is also utilized to prevent the theft of commercial trade secrets. Many of these cases, for example, entail former employees sharing critical information with international markets. A former Bristol-Myers-Squibb employee stole trade secrets from the company, which he planned to use to establish a pharmaceutical firm in India. Valspar Corporation chemist admitted to stealing formulas and other information valued at $20 million, which he would use working for an overseas competitor. Another chemist stole information from DuPont on Organic Light Emitting Diodes or OLED technology used for display and lighting applications. An employee for Dow AgroSciences in Indianapolis had a similar intent to take trade secrets to China. In June 2010, Espinel's Joint Strategic Plan integrated perspectives across federal agencies, such as U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Justice, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and U.S. Copyright Office. It also considered 1,600 public comments and suggestions from the American public. Under this plan, the federal government will avoid purchase or use of infringing products, support transparency in the development of enforcement policy, as well as improve coordination and thus, effectiveness of intellectual property enforcement. The plan also aims to further protect American intellectual property rights through international outreach and to improve data and information collection regarding criminal violations of intellectual property. IPEC has collected data through a Budget Data Request (BDR), in which federal agencies report the resources used and measured outcomes in intellectual property enforcement. Espinel hosted an Intellectual Property Health and Safety Forum at the White House, meeting with private sector leaders from American Express, eNom, GoDaddy, Google, MasterCard, Microsoft, Neustar, Visa and Yahoo! to take action against illegal online pharmacies, which pose a threat to health in the act of selling counterfeit drugs online. Due to interagency and cross-border efforts, the FBI was able to convict individuals selling cancer drugs that did not contain ingredients to fight cancer. The PRO-IP Act is also intended to prevent the sale of counterfeit products for use in U.S. defense and weapons systems that may possibly fail under fire, causing harm to troop missions and ultimately, public safety. In one case, a business owner was prosecuted for selling counterfeit Cisco products, which were intended to relay troop movement and intelligence for a U.S. Marine Corps base in Iraq. As a result of this work, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE HSI) opened 1,033 intellectual property cases, which resulted in 365 arrests, 216 indictments and 170 federal and state convictions. ICE HSI has identified and seized domain names facilitating the trafficking of unlicensed materials. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE HSI had 19,959 intellectual property seizures, which resulted in 237 civil fines and penalties totaling over $62 million. Many have contested the legality of these seizures, suggesting that excessive shutdowns of domain names and other rogue sites is a violation of free speech. John Morton, director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has stated that the organization has \\"zero interest in limiting free speech\\" and that \\"ICE is not the police of the Internet.\\" In 2011, the federal government aims to shut down top illegal websites and to secure legislation that will enable funding for U.S. embassies to monitor American intellectual property internationally. For example, President Obama discussed enforcement of intellectual property rights with Chinese President Hu Jintao. Alongside Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, Obama urged Hu to take action against consumers who purchase Microsoft software and other counterfeit DVDs and CDs for only a fraction of the cost online or in public markets. Other European countries and Japan have also addressed this growing problem in China, where the authorities hesitate to arrest counterfeiters due to the fact that such products bolster local economies. Since the passage of the PRO-IP Act, the National Association of Manufacturers has lobbied for further legislation, as well. In addition to identifying counterfeit and infringing products, the Association would like the legislation that compiles a \\"watch list\\" database of importers, shippers and other participants at U.S. ports. Such legislation should also increase fines, as well as develop tools to ensure that manufacturers receive timely information about acts of infringement.

In May 1857, a house and a vacant lot owned by Stickney were rented and, along with another house, were used to start the Columbia Institution.

Kendall, the oldest daughter of Amos Kendall, on January 15, 1852 in a ceremony that took place on Kendall Green. They had two children: William \\"Will\\" Soule Stickney (October 24, 1852 - July 20, 1880), and a second child who died at six months of age in 1854. Stickney attended Waterville College (now Colby College) in Maine, from 1846 to 1849, then entered the senior class at the Columbian University in Washington, DC (now George Washington University) and graduated from that institution. He was admitted to the bar to practice law in St. Louis, Missouri in 1850. He worked as a government clerk from 1852 to 1857, then worked as personal secretary to Amos Kendall from 1852 until Kendall's death in 1869. Stickney died on October 13, 1881, after a four-day illness. He was descended from William Stickney who settled in Massachusetts in 1636, having come from the town of Stickney on the eastern coast of England.

The Desert Garden Conservatory is adjacent to the Huntington Desert Garden itself. The Garden houses one of the most important collections of cacti and other succulent plants in the world, including a large number of rare and endangered species. The Desert Garden Conservatory serves The Huntington and public communities as a conservation facility, research resource and genetic diversity preserve. John N. Trager is the Desert Collection curator. There are an estimated 10,000 succulents worldwide, about 1,500 of them classified as cacti. The Huntington Desert Garden Conservatory now contains more than 2,200 accessions, representing more than 43 plant families, 1,261 different species and subspecies, and 246 genera. The plant collection contains examples from the world's major desert regions, including the southern United States, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil, Canary Islands, Madagascar, Malawi, Mexico and South Africa. The Desert Collection plays a critical role as a repository of biodiversity, in addition to serving as an outreach and education center.  Propagation program to save rare and endangered plants  Some studies estimate that as many as two-thirds of the world’s flora and fauna may become extinct during the course of the 21st century, the result of global warming and encroaching development. Scientists alarmed by these prospects are working diligently to propagate plants outside their natural habitats, in protected areas. Ex-situ cultivation, as this practice is known, can serve as a stopgap for plants that will otherwise be lost to the world as their habitats disappear. To this end, The Huntington has a program to protect and plant propagate endangered plant species, designated International Succulent Introductions (ISI). The aim of the ISI program is to propagate and distribute new or rare succulents to collectors, nurseries and institutions to further research and appreciation of these remarkable plants. The ISI distributes as many as 40 new succulent varieties every year. Field-collected plants, cuttings or seeds are not sold, only seedlings, grafts and rooted cuttings produced under nursery conditions without detriment to wild populations.  The Schick hybrids  The Schick hybrids are derived primarily from crosses of Harry Johnson’s Paramount hybrids, created in the 1930s and 40s, and from successive crosses of their progeny. Like the Paramount hybrids, the Schick hybrids can flower several times in a season and, with increasing age, can produce greater numbers of flowers. Under the Huntington’s growing conditions the first flush of flowers is typically in April with successive flushes occurring in May, June and July, and, in some hybrids, even into August, September and October. These horticultural-significant cultivars are also available through The Huntington’s ISI program.

The first version was introduced in 2002. The Arcadia websiteArcadia website provides a program manual, tutorials, a user forum, as well as download options for the software — for 14 days of test use. PhotoPerfect has been discontinued.https://web.archive.org/web/20150321002913/http://www.arcadiasoftware.com/  Program features  PhotoPerfect is similar to such programs as Adobe Photoshop and the open-source GIMP, Unlike these other programs, PhotoPerfect is designed primarily to edit and improve existing photos, and not for graphics creation. Its window can contain several movable subwindows. The main window contains, clockwise: A histogram set, a list of available processing resources, a file directory list, and a thumbnail strip from the selected directory. The program operations are generally available both in a standard menu system and as icons on optional toolbars. Selecting an image modification option will generally open a window with a tabbed user interface — for selecting within a group of related operations. Each tab will generally contain one or more lever-operated controls, and the tab's image display has a user-operated divider separating the transformed and untransformed versions of the image. The color curves can be controlled (with level limit control) while the resulting histograms are displayed. RAW files can be opened, and TIFF images can be both opened and saved. A special set of 16-bit operations is available for these. Some dynamic range improvement (within 8 bits) may also be achieved by means of the operation Merge Images DRI. The list of available Processing resources lists the available (built-in and user-supplied) macros, batch processing routines and scripts. PhotoShop-compatible plugins will appear in this list, ready for use, if their .8BF files have been placed in the PhotoPerfect directory. Extra functions (on the Extras menu) include tools for: * Slide Show: Combines images for use with a slide show viewer (FFV.exe) * Mosaic: Transforms an image into a mosaic, using a specified set of mosaic piece images. * AVI (animation): Creates an AVI movie from a multi-burst image set, or transforms one image into a sequence, e.g. through panning. * Stereoscopic (3D) image: Generates a 3D image with red & cyan, for viewing with red & cyan glasses. * Measurements (of lengths, angles, areas and brightness) * Graphic markers: For placing arrows, circles, squares and polylines (with straight line segments). * Lens (fringe) correction Some special image optimizing extensions may be bought separately from Arcadia Software, and they can then be selected from the Image Optimization menu: PerfectlyClear, I2E, Xe847, and these combined by the option Multi-automatic.

It is a severe, progressive form of bronchiolitis, an inflammatory condition of the bronchioles (small air passages in the lungs). The term diffuse signifies that lesions appear throughout both lungs, while panbronchiolitis refers to inflammation found in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles (those involved in gas exchange). DPB causes severe inflammation and nodule-like lesions of terminal bronchioles, chronic sinusitis, and intense coughing with large amounts of sputum production. The disease is believed to occur when there is susceptibility, or a lack of immune system resistance, to DPB-causing bacteria or viruses, caused by several genes that are found predominantly in individuals of East Asian descent. The highest incidence occurs among Japanese people, followed by Koreans. DPB occurs more often in males and usually begins around age 40. It was recognized as a distinct new disease in the early 1960s and was formally named diffuse panbronchiolitis in 1969. If left untreated, DPB progresses to bronchiectasis, an irreversible lung condition that involves enlargement of the bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the bronchiolar passages. Daily treatment of DPB with macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin eases symptoms and increases survival time, but the disease currently has no known cure. The eventual result of DPB can be respiratory failure and heart problems.  Classification  The term \\"bronchiolitis\\" generally refers to inflammation of the bronchioles. DPB is classified as a form of \\"primary bronchiolitis\\", which means that the underlying cause of bronchiolitis is originating from or is confined to the bronchioles. Along with DPB, additional forms of primary bronchiolitis include bronchiolitis obliterans, follicular bronchiolitis, respiratory bronchiolitis, mineral dust airway disease, and a number of others. Unlike DPB, bronchiolitis that is not considered \\"primary\\" would be associated with diseases of the larger airways, such as chronic bronchitis.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms of DPB include chronic sinusitis (inflamed paranasal sinuses), wheezing, crackles (respiratory sounds made by obstructions such as phlegm and secretions in the lungs), dyspnea (shortness of breath), and a severe cough that yields large amounts of sputum (coughed-up phlegm). There may be pus in the sputum, and affected individuals may have fever. Typical signs of DPB progression include dilation (enlargement) of the bronchiolar passages and hypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood). If DPB is left untreated, bronchiectasis will occur; it is characterized by dilation and thickening of the walls of the bronchioles, inflammatory damage to respiratory and terminal bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the lungs. DPB is associated with progressive respiratory failure, hypercapnia (increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood), and can eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary vein and artery) and cor pulmonale (dilation of the right ventricle of the heart, or \\"right heart failure\\").  Cause  The genes for human HLA are located on chromosome 6. DPB is idiopathic, which means an exact physiological, environmental, or pathogenic cause of the disease is unknown. However, several factors are suspected to be involved with its pathogenesis (the way in which the disease works). The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a large genomic region found in most vertebrates that is associated with the immune system. It is located on chromosome 6 in humans. A subset of MHC in humans is human leukocyte antigen (HLA), which controls the antigen-presenting system, as part of adaptive immunity against pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. When human cells are infected by a pathogen, some of them can present parts of the pathogen's proteins on their surfaces; this is called \\"antigen presentation\\". The infected cells then become targets for types of cytotoxic T-cells, which kill the infected cells so they can be removed from the body. Genetic predisposition for DPB susceptibility has been localized to two HLA haplotypes (a nucleotide or gene sequence difference between paired chromosomes, that is more likely to occur among a common ethnicity or trait) common to people of East Asian descent. HLA-B54 is associated with DPB in the Japanese, while HLA-A11 is associated with the disease in Koreans. Several genes within this region of class I HLA are believed to be responsible for DPB, by allowing increased susceptibility to the disease. The common genetic background and similarities in the HLA profile of affected Japanese and Korean individuals were considered in the search for a DPB gene. It was suggested that a mutation of a suspected disease-susceptibility gene located somewhere between HLA-B and HLA-A had occurred on an ancestral chromosome carrying both HLA-B54 and HLA-A11. Further, it is possible that a number of genetic recombination events around the disease locus (location on a chromosome) could have resulted in the disease being associated with HLA-B54 in the Japanese and HLA-A11 in Koreans. After further study, it was concluded that a DPB susceptibility gene is located near the HLA-B locus at chromosome 6p21.3. Within this area, the search for a genetic cause of the disease has continued. Because many genes belonging to HLA remain unidentified, positional cloning (a method used to identify a specific gene, when only its location on a chromosome is known) has been used to determine that a mucin-like gene is associated with DPB. In addition, diseases caused by identified HLA genes in the DPB-susceptibility region have been investigated. One of these, bare lymphocyte syndrome I (BLS I), exhibits a number of similarities with DPB in those affected, including chronic sinusitis, bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of H. influenzae. Also like DPB, BLS I responds favorably to erythromycin therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode of treatment, and the fact that the gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment of a gene responsible for DPB. Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes and cigarette smoking are not believed to play a role in DPB, and unknown environmental and other non- genetic causes--such as unidentified bacteria or viruses--have not been ruled out. Cystic fibrosis (CF), a progressive multi-system lung disease, has been considered in the search for a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, mutation in a specific gene--much more likely to occur in Europeans--causes CF. This mutation in the CF-causing gene is not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this gene is known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this gene in any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.  Pathophysiology  Inflammation is a normal part of the human immune response, whereby leukocytes (white blood cells), including neutrophils (white blood cells that specialize in causing inflammation), gather, and chemokines (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. Inflammation interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause the proliferation of inflammatory cells into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, the inflammation continues for an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, inflammation in DPB can be so severe that nodules containing inflammatory cells form in the walls of the bronchioles. The presence of inflammation and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess mucus, which must be coughed up as sputum. The combination of inflammation, nodule development, infection, mucus, and frequent cough contributes to the breathing difficulties in DPB. The fact that inflammation in DPB persists with or without the presence of P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae provides a means to determine several mechanisms of DPB pathogenesis. Leukotrienes are eicosanoids, signaling molecules made from essential fatty acids, which play a role in many lung diseases by causing the proliferation of inflammatory cells and excess mucus production in the airways. In DPB and other lung diseases, the predominant mediator of neutrophil-related inflammation is leukotriene B4, which specializes in neutrophil proliferation via chemotaxis (the movement of some types of cells toward or away from certain molecules). Inflammation in DPB is also caused by the chemokine MIP-1alpha and its involvement with CD8+ T cells. Beta defensins, a family of antimicrobial peptides found in the respiratory tract, are responsible for further inflammation in DPB when a pathogen such as P. aeruginosa is present. If present with DPB, the human T-lymphotropic virus, type I, a retrovirus, modifies DPB pathogenesis by infecting T helper cells and altering their effectiveness in recognizing the presence of known or unknown pathogens involved with DPB.  Diagnosis  High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images of the lower chest in a 16-year-old boy initially diagnosed with DPB (left), and 8 weeks later (right) after a 6-week course of treatment with erythromycin. The bilateral bronchiectasis and prominent centri-lobular nodules with a \\"tree-in-bud\\" pattern shows noticeable improvement. The diagnosis of DPB requires analysis of the lungs and bronchiolar tissues, which can require a lung biopsy, or the more preferred high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs. The diagnostic criteria include severe inflammation in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles and lung tissue lesions that appear as nodules within the terminal and respiratory bronchioles in both lungs. The nodules in DPB appear as opaque lumps when viewed on X-rays of the lung, and can cause airway obstruction, which is evaluated by a pulmonary function test, or PFT. Lung X-rays can also reveal dilation of the bronchiolar passages, another sign of DBP. HRCT scans often show blockages of some bronchiolar passages with mucus, which is referred to as the \\"tree-in-bud\\" pattern. Hypoxemia, another sign of breathing difficulty, is revealed by measuring the oxygen and carbon dioxide content of the blood, using a blood test called arterial blood gas. Other findings observed with DPB include the proliferation of lymphocytes (white blood cells that fight infection), neutrophils, and foamy histiocytes (tissue macrophages) in the lung lining. Bacteria such as H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa are also detectable, with the latter becoming more prominent as the disease progresses. The white blood, bacterial and other cellular content of the blood can be measured by taking a complete blood count (CBC). Elevated levels of IgG and IgA (classes of immunoglobulins) may be seen, as well as the presence of rheumatoid factor (an indicator of autoimmunity). Hemagglutination, a clumping of red blood cells in response to the presence of antibodies in the blood, may also occur. Neutrophils, beta-defensins, leukotrienes, and chemokines can also be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid injected then removed from the bronchiolar airways of individuals with DPB, for evaluation. = Differential diagnosis = In the differential diagnosis (finding the correct diagnosis between diseases that have overlapping features) of some obstructive lung diseases, DPB is often considered. A number of DPB symptoms resemble those found with other obstructive lung diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. Wheezing, coughing with sputum production, and shortness of breath are common symptoms in such diseases, and obstructive respiratory functional impairment is found on pulmonary function testing. Cystic fibrosis, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, excess mucus production, and infection; but DPB does not cause disturbances of the pancreas nor the electrolytes, as does CF, so the two diseases are different and probably unrelated. DPB is distinguished by the presence of lesions that appear on X-rays as nodules in the bronchioles of both lungs; inflammation in all tissue layers of the respiratory bronchioles; and its higher prevalence among individuals with East Asian lineage. DPB and bronchiolitis obliterans are two forms of primary bronchiolitis. Specific overlapping features of both diseases include strong cough with large amounts of often pus-filled sputum; nodules viewable on lung X-rays in the lower bronchi and bronchiolar area; and chronic sinusitis. In DPB, the nodules are more restricted to the respiratory bronchioles, while in OB they are often found in the membranous bronchioles (the initial non-cartilaginous section of the bronchiole, that divides from the tertiary bronchus) up to the secondary bronchus. OB is a bronchiolar disease with worldwide prevalence, while DPB has more localized prevalence, predominantly in Japan. Prior to clinical recognition of DPB in recent years, it was often misdiagnosed as bronchiectasia, COPD, IPF, phthisis miliaris, sarcoidosis or alveolar cell carcinoma.  Treatment  Molecular structure of Erythromycin A, an antibiotic used to treat DPB Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, are an effective treatment for DPB when taken regularly over an extended period of time. Clarithromycin or roxithromycin are also commonly used. The successful results of macrolides in DPB and similar lung diseases stems from managing certain symptoms through immunomodulation (adjusting the immune response), which can be achieved by taking the antibiotics in low doses. Treatment consists of daily oral administration of erythromycin for two to three years, an extended period that has been shown to dramatically improve the effects of DPB. This is apparent when an individual undergoing treatment for DPB, among a number of disease-related remission criteria, has a normal neutrophil count detected in BAL fluid, and blood gas (an arterial blood test that measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood) readings show that free oxygen in the blood is within the normal range. Allowing a temporary break from erythromycin therapy in these instances has been suggested, to reduce the formation of macrolide-resistant P. aeruginosa. However, DPB symptoms usually return, and treatment would need to be resumed. Although highly effective, erythromycin may not prove successful in all individuals with the disease, particularly if macrolide-resistant P. aeruginosa is present or previously untreated DPB has progressed to the point where respiratory failure is occurring. With erythromycin therapy in DPB, great reduction in bronchiolar inflammation and damage is achieved through suppression of not only neutrophil proliferation, but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive mucus and water secretions in airways. The antibiotic effects of macrolides are not involved in their beneficial effects toward reducing inflammation in DPB. This is evident because the treatment dosage is much too low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of macrolide- resistant P. aeruginosa, erythromycin therapy still reduces inflammation. A number of factors are involved in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.  Prognosis  Untreated DPB leads to bronchiectasis, respiratory failure, and death. A journal report from 1983 indicated that untreated DPB had a five-year survival rate of 62.1%, while the 10-year survival rate was 33.2%. With erythromycin treatment, individuals with DPB now have a much longer life expectancy due to better management of symptoms, delay of progression, and prevention of associated infections like P. aeruginosa. The 10-year survival rate for treated DPB is about 90%. In DPB cases where treatment has resulted in significant improvement, which sometimes happens after about two years, treatment has been allowed to end for a while. However, individuals allowed to stop treatment during this time are closely monitored. As DPB has been proven to recur, erythromycin therapy must be promptly resumed once disease symptoms begin to reappear. In spite of the improved prognosis when treated, DPB currently has no known cure.  Epidemiology  DPB has its highest prevalence among the Japanese, at 11 per 100,000 population. Korean, Chinese, and Thai individuals with the disease have been reported as well. A genetic predisposition among East Asians is suggested. The disease is more common in males, with the male to female ratio at 1.4-2:1 (or about 5 men to 3 women). The average onset of the disease is around age 40, and two-thirds of those affected are non-smokers, although smoking is not believed to be a cause. The presence of HLA-Bw54 increases the risk of diffuse panbronchiolitis 13.3-fold. In Europe and the Americas, a relatively small number of DPB cases have been reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.  History  In the early 1960s, a relatively new chronic lung disease was being observed and described by physicians in Japan. In 1969, the name \\"diffuse panbronchiolitis\\" was introduced to distinguish it from chronic bronchitis, emphysema, alveolitis, and other obstructive lung disease with inflammation. Between 1978 and 1980, the results of a nationwide survey initiated by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan revealed more than 1,000 probable cases of DPB, with 82 histologically confirmed. By the 1980s, it was internationally recognized as a distinct disease of the lungs. Before the 1980s, the prognosis or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with superinfection (the emergence of a new viral or bacterial infection, in addition to the currently occurring infection) by P. aeruginosa. DPB continued to have a very high mortality rate before generalized antibiotic treatment and oxygen therapy were beginning to be used routinely in the effort to manage symptoms. Around 1985, when long-term treatment with the antibiotic erythromycin became the standard for managing DPB, the prognosis significantly improved. In 1990, the association of DPB with HLA was initially asserted.

It was released for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles, and MS-DOS computers. Unlike the film and real rules of basketball, each team plays 3-on-3. Players have a choice whether to play as the TuneSquad or the Monstars. It features basic controls and 2D graphics. The game was developed by Sculptured Software, who coincidentally had developed the Looney Tunes-based basketball game Looney Tunes B-Ball for Sunsoft the year prior to the production of the Space Jam film, and published by Acclaim Entertainment, who coincidentally had been publishing the NBA Jam series of wacky-themed basketball games. Gameplay Before the actual game of basketball begins, Daffy Duck takes part in a game where he has to find parts of Michael Jordan's uniform, avoiding the family dog Charles. In-between quarters, mini-games such as Shoot Out, Space Race, and Hall of Hijinx are available; after the 2nd quarter, Bugs takes part in a mini-game where he has to find water bottles containing Michael's secret stuff. Reception Space Jam received negative reviews, with critics generally commenting that the basketball is overly simplistic and easy. Some attributed this to the unbalanced characters, stating that Michael Jordan is overpowered and the Monstars are all underpowered. Most found the mini-games to be poor. The graphics were also criticized, with many critics saying they could have been done on 16-bit consoles, though the depictions of the popular Looney Tunes characters were praised. Dr. Zombie of GamePro described the game as \\"ordinary\\". GameSpots Tom Ham stated that \\"despite the use of much-loved Warner Bros. cartoon characters, Space Jam fails miserably in every category.\\" Dan Hsu and Crispin Boyer of Electronic Gaming Monthly also panned the game, while their co-reviewers Shawn Smith and Sushi-X defended it, arguing that it was clearly designed for children, making the simplistic gameplay and low difficulty appropriate for its target audience. A reviewer for Next Generation countered this argument by pointing out that it uses one more button than NBA Jam does, which he felt made it too complicated for young players. He remarked that \\"While it's hard to forgive the poor basketball, it's even harder to like Space Jam given the disc's numerous carnival style mini games ... They add some variety, but are so simplistic that the effort put into creating them would have been much better spent on improving the core game.\\" Sega Saturn Magazines Lee Nutter felt that Space Jam was decent as a multiplayer game, but fell short of other basketball games on the market, most notably Acclaim and Sculptured Software's own NBA Jam Extreme.

Pictures). It opened on May 4, 1998, replacing the Ghostbusters Spooktacular attraction in the New York area of the park. The attraction was hosted by actors Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt, who starred in the original film. The attraction closed on November 1, 2015 and was subsequently replaced with Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon, which opened on April 6, 2017. History Prior to the opening of Twister...Ride it Out, its spot was formerly home to Ghostbusters Spooktacular, a Ghostbusters themed show that opened along with Universal Studios Florida on June 7, 1990. By the mid 1990s, the popularity of the attraction had severely dwindled. On October 15, 1996, Universal Studios Florida announced the closure of Ghostbusters Spooktacular. The final show would take place on November 8, 1996. The same year Ghostbusters Spooktacular closed, Twister was released in theaters. Universal officials said that it was time for a change. On February 6, 1997, Universal Studios Florida announced that Twister...Ride it Out would be added in 1998. It would be located towards the back of the park in the former spot of Ghostbusters Spooktacular. Construction began in the spring of 1997 and was completed later that year. A small portion of the Aftermath gift shop was open at the same time. To accurately simulate a tornado, Universal Parks & Resorts entered talks with tornado meteorologists to discover the actual sights, sound, and feel of the experience. Twister...Ride it Out was originally going to open in March 1998, but just a few weeks before that, the Kissimmee tornado outbreak happened nearby. For this, the attraction's opening was delayed to May 4, 1998. In 2008, the outdoor queue line was reduced to make room for Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit, where the roller coaster blasts through the firehouse facade. The ride involved the closure of the Boneyard in September 2008, and the moving of the Blue Man Group pathway in November 2008. This was to make room for the Universal Music Plaza Stage and the entrance of Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit. On February 16, 2009, the attraction began operating only during peak seasons. However, it was re-opened by Universal on March 9, 2009 due to guest demand. The Aftermath gift shop was converted into the Halloween Horror Nights 25 store during the park's 2015 Halloween event. This meant that all Twister theming and props were replaced with Halloween ones. At that time, Twister...Ride it Out was becoming a very outdated attraction. On October 27, 2015, the decision was made to retire Twister...Ride it Out after 17 years of service. Last rides were given on November 1 and by 2016, it was all gone. During the last operating day, park guests were dressed in Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt uniforms. In 2017, the attraction was directly replaced by Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon, a 3D motion simulator ride. There is a tribute to the attraction in the windows of the ride facade behind the queue. The items include Bill Paxton's light blue shirt, a stapler that reads B. Paxton and an advertisement of a soda can that says Twister Cola. Attraction summary =Queue= In the first half of the queue, guests bypass some studio props and the New York facade. A variety of songs is played on the speakers in this area. A cow imprint in a metal bay door in the wall is shown on the left side. On the right side, there are Steven Spielberg, Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt director chairs. From time to time in the later years, guests can hear the roars coming from the Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit. Guests make a left turn and enter the second half of the queue which is outside. It is a small mock-up of the Oklahoma town of Wakita. When the attraction first opened, it featured a much larger outdoor queue with several vehicles, switchbacks, crop fields, a windmill and the Wakita water tower. However, that section was reduced by 2008. If guests get bored in the queue, guests can watch real tornado videos on the television screens. Each video begins with the location and date being shown as a sound effect can be heard. In addition, the television screens also show tornado facts that guests can read while waiting in line. Each fact features a symbol being shown on the upper left side, a tornado background and wind blowing sound effects. Some of the facts include flying debris. Occasionally, Bill Paxton tells the safety of the attraction with the Twister logo being shown on the screens. Guests see some props, such as an Esmoo's Dairy sign above some haybales. There is a Wakita sign and a damaged New Channel 4 billboard featuring a map and a lady. A plastic talking cow can be found in the queue line. When guests press the button, the cow will moo and say \\"Drink Esmoo Milk. Fresh from the farm to your fridge.\\" There are signs of the Fujita Scale that feature tornado pictures and description. DOROTHY II can be seen near the waiting area. As the doors to Soundstage 50 open, the employees allow guests to enter the first pre-show room. =Pre-Show= left As guests walk into Soundstage 50, there will be more props, such as a piano and road signs. The Downdraft soundtrack from the film can be heard in this room. There are two large screens and two smaller ones in front. Soon enough, the pre-show wil be ready. The beginning of the film will be shown first. When the scene ends, the Twister logo is shown. Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt then appear on the screens to talk about their experiences filming the movie. =Scene 1= Guests next walk into a new room which is a model of Aunt Meg's damaged house after the twister. As guests walk into the kitchen, televisions are seen impaled into the wall, as if by tremendous force. There is a Hidden Mickey on one of the car wheels on the ceiling. Paxton and Hunt appear on the televisions and talk about the extreme experiences filming Twister, such as enduring the blasts of jet engines, having bits of chopped-up ice shot at them to simulate hail, and even having a gas tanker dropped in front of them and explode. They also mention that during filming, actual tornadoes started touching down south of the filming locations. Paxton in particular claims that the role leaves one in fearful awe of tornadoes and the terrible power they can unleash. The moment they finish, a thunder sound effect is heard as the televisions start to static and tornado warning sirens begin to blare. The doors to the main show open and staff members with flashing red emergency glowsticks lead guests into the room. =Scene 2: Main Show= Inside the main show room, a message is playing telling guests to get out of the house as television screens show the Channel 5 News report, with a weather anchor issuing a tornado warning. Guests are finally led onto a set resembling the Galaxy Drive-In Theater scene in the movie, standing on a platform just outside the auto repair shop. They line up in three separate rows on a tiered observation platform under a corrugated metal roof, overlooking a real sound stage outdoor scene featuring a view of the rural Galaxy Drive-in theater and the Rocket Hamburgers diner at dusk as dark clouds roll overhead. Suddenly, a tree gets struck by lightning, scenes from The People Under the Stairs appear on the movie screen, sirens sound briefly, and winds in the room get stronger, as well as rain falling from the sky. A small flashlight can be seen inside the Rocket Hamburgers a couple of feet away, as well as voices of family within the restaurant screaming to get inside along with a dog barking. A projected tornado drops from the sky in the background. As it fully forms getting closer, the tornado turns and destroys the drive-in theater. Then another tornado would appear on stage five stories tall and twelve feet wide. The glass on the Rocket Hamburgers window shatters as the guests would be squirted with water from behind. DOROTHY flies by as lightning flashes. The Galaxy Drive-in sign rips away and crashes inside Eric's garage. After that happens, a cow flies by the guests which is a homage to a scene in the film. The roof of the observation platform also threatens to tear off, being pulled upwards. A Dodge Ram parked in front of the garage slides towards a couple of gas tanks with the force of the tornado pulling it. The truck hits one of the gas tanks as gasoline liquid drains. Sparks are caused by the impact of the truck and fire forms up reaching the tornado which causes a fireball three stories high to erupt. The twister dies out, and the roof falls down above the guests. As this happens, the floor also gives a sudden drop giving guests a final scare. Bill Paxton thanks everyone for surviving twister directing them to exit to their left through the \\"Aftermath\\" gift shop.

Description Argos Hill Mill is a post mill on a single storey roundhouse. She had four patent sails carried on a cast iron windshaft and is winded by a tailpole mounted fantail. The main post is made up from four pieces of timber. Along with Jill, Clayton, she is one of only two windmills in England to retain this feature. The mill drove two pairs of millstones, arranged head and tail. The cast iron brake wheel is diameter and the wooden tail wheel is diameter. The mill is unusual in the way that it has been extended at the rear, giving it a distinctive appearance. History The earliest record of a windmill on this site is in 1656. Argos Hill Mill was built in 1835. She worked by wind until 1927, mostly by successive generations of the Weston family. The fantail blew off in 1929 and the shutters were removed from the sails in 1932. The mill was acquired by Uckfield District Council in 1955. Neve's, the Heathfield millwrights fitted a new breast beam and repaired the side girts and corner posts. Further restoration work was done in 1969 by Hole's of Burgess Hill. A storm damaged a sail in 1976, and a new sail and stock were fitted by Hole's. Millers *Aaron Weston 1844 *William Richardson - 1927 References for above:- Threat of demolition The mill in August 2008 A survey in 2007 revealed the mill was in danger of collapsing. Of concern were the roundhouse, crosstrees, crown tree, sails, tailpole and fantail. On 14 January 2008, a meeting was held in Mayfield, where Wealden District Council put forward options for the mill's future. One proposal, to dismantle the mill and remove it to storage was strongly criticised by those attending, including members of the Sussex Mills Group and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. It was pointed out that Wealden District Council had not spent money allocated for maintenance of the mill, and that giving themselves permission to demolish a listed building would make other listed buildings in the area more vulnerable, and erode the protection given by listed building status. As a result, the Friends of Argos Hill Windmill was set up to save the mill. Restoration in progress In April 2010, the Argos Hill Windmill Trust was established to lease the mill from Wealden District Council with the aim of restoring it to working order. A high-profile fundraising campaign was launched in 2011 to raise funds for the restoration and a substantial lottery grant obtained. Holes were engaged to restore the main structure of the mill and return the striking gear to working order, while volunteers tackled the replacement of the weatherboard on the mill itself, and the renovation of the roundhouse floor, walls and roof. These first two phases of the restoration project were successfully completed in 2016 when the mill's sweeps turned in the wind for the first time in over 80 years. Phase 3 of the restoration project is now underway to rebuild the fantail and restore the internal machinery. See the Friends of Argos Hill Windmill website for details and open days.

The vote was held to determine whether Morales, Vice President Álvaro García Linera, and eight out of nine departmental Prefects should stay in office.Simon Gardner, \\"Morales seen winning Bolivia vote, reforms in air\\", Reuters (The Washington Post), August 7, 2008 (accessed August 7, 2008). Morales received more than 67% support and six of the eight prefects were returned. The prefects of Cochabamba Department and La Paz Department were defeated and had to face re-election. Background The referendum was initially suggested by Morales in December 2007, but was rejected by the opposition at the time. However, the opposition-controlled Senate brought back the suggestion following their victory in the Santa Cruz autonomy referendum on 4 May 2008, with Morales agreeing to hold the vote. The recall election would be deemed successful if the percentage voting in favour of the recall exceeded the percentage of voters that originally voted for the person. For Morales and Linera, there would have to be more than 53.74% (their margin in the 2005 presidential election). The same rules apply for the governors, but their margins are between 48% and 38% in La Paz Department which makes their recall much easier to accomplish.\\"Morales setzt Referendum über seine Amtsführung an\\", NZZ Online, May 13, 2008. If the recall is successful then fresh elections would be held.\\"Bolivians to hold confidence vote\\", BBC News, May 9, 2008. Morales has stated that if he stays in office, he will use the referendum result as a springboard for more reforms – for instance, setting a date for the constitutional referendum which would grant more rights to Bolivia's poor indigenous population.\\"Morales 'set on Bolivia reforms'\\", BBC News, May 15, 2008 If he loses, he said he would go back to farming coca. Polls in May 2008 showed Morales easily defeating the recall.\\"Morales Would Defeat Opponents Again in Bolivia\\", Angus Reid Global Monitor, May 28, 2008. Following autonomy referendums held in the second quarter of 2008 in Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando and Tarija, the governors of these four states initially refused to take part in the recall referendum unless the referendum complied with the new autonomy statutes, which the Supreme Electoral Court considers to be invalid; they pushed for early elections to be held instead.\\"Governors snub Bolivia referendum\\", BBC News, June 24, 2008. Nonetheless, the governors later agreed to participate.\\"Bolivia's opposition governors agree to recall vote\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), July 5, 2008. However, there were still obstructive measures from these four departments a few days before the referendum.\\"Maneuvers to Block Referendum Soars in Bolivia\\" , Prensa Latina, July 31, 2008. The recall referendum did not apply to the governor of Chuquisaca Department, as Savina Cuéllar was just elected very recently in June 2008. Cuéllar was a member of the Bolivian Constituent Assembly for Morales' Movement for Socialism, but ran for governorship of Chuquisaca as the candidate of the opposition Interinstitutional Committee Alliance, winning with 55% to MAS' Wálter Valda's 45%.Upside Down World - Politics in Bolivia: Volatile Loyalties, Deep Divisions The gubernatorial election was held after the previous governor, David Sánchez of MAS, resigned (against the wish of his party) due to violent protests. Shortly before the election, the rules were changed, though the legality of this move remains in doubt; under the new rules, the governors will be removed from office if over 50% of voters recall them, effectively raising the threshold required.James Painter, \\"Divided Bolivia set for referendum\\", BBC News, August 9, 2008.

He was a teacher and advisor of Suddhodana, the father of the Buddha, and is best known for having predicted that prince Siddhartha of Kapilavastu would either become a great chakravartin or become a supreme religious leader; Siddhartha was later known as Gautama Buddha. The name Asita literally means 'not clinging' while Kanhasiri means 'dark splendour'. Asita is described as a tāpasa, a practitioner of asceticism.  Biography  The Theravada tradition depicts Asita as an advisor and chaplain to Sihahanu, the grandfather of Gotama Buddha.Dictionary of Pali Proper Names - Asita He was the teacher of Suddhodana, and then served him as he had his father. At the time of the birth of the Buddha, he had retired by permission of Suddhodana and was living in the forest as an ascetic. A vision alerted Asita of the birth of the Bodhisattva Gotama, causing him to leave the forest and travel to see the infant, where he prophesied that he would become either a 'wheel turning monarch' (chakravartin) or a Buddha. Disappointed that his own life would end before the Buddha awakened and began preaching, he ordained his nephew, Nalaka, so that he would be able to hear the Buddha's teachings. Nalaka is called Naradatta in the Lalitavistara.  Names and Related Figures  Asita was known under several alternate names or nicknames, and Buddhaghosa attributed his name to his dark complexion. He was known as Kanha Devala, Kanha Siri or Siri Kanha, and Kāla Devala. Another sage or rishi known as Asita Devala is sometimes confused with him in literary sources- this second Asita Devala was a sage from ancient times who was reborn as a disciple of the Buddha. This confusion may explain why in the Lalitavistara Sūtra there are two versions of Asita's prophecy- one where Asita visits Suddhodana as described in the Pali sources, and another where Asita is a hermit living in the Himalayas who never meets Suddhodana but perceives the birth of the Buddha due to his supernatural powers. The Pali tradition also records a pratyekabuddha called Asita, and a man who lived at the time of Sikkhi Buddha who was reborn as a disciple of Gotama Buddha. Early Western scholars related Asita to Simeon (Gospel of Luke), who blessed Jesus as an infant.

The agreement was signed by Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and American Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and pledged specific actions from both parties to increase strategic cooperation between them. The main objective was to deter Soviet threats and ‘Soviet controlled forces’ in the Middle East. Israel had aimed for some time at the creation of a more formal bond which would commit the United States to a closer military cooperation.George Lenczowski, “American Presidents and the Middle East” Duke University Press, 1990. . (p.261) The signing marked the beginning of close security cooperation and coordination between the American and Israeli governments.Embassy of Israel in Washington DC It was formally reconfirmed at the time of Reagan’s second peace initiative, on April 21, 1988. The agreement took the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and was an act of the executive branch not subject to Senate ratification. Therefore, it was not a treaty, which requires Senate ratification. Formally, it did not constitute an official alliance. Frequent references of the President and political leaders to Israel as an ally, did not carry with them the weight of a legal commitment to declare or enter a war on Israel’s side in the sense envisioned by the U.S. Constitution. Politically, the strategic cooperation agreement represented a major policy shift toward Israel regarding American involvement in the Middle East. Since there was no corresponding pact signed with any Arab state, the United States could no longer claim to act as an impartial mediator or arbiter in the Arab Israeli conflicts.

The full text of the understanding is shown in the links below. George Lenczowski, summarizes the main points as follows. George Lenczowski, (p.261) * The United States and Israel to form a committee to arrange for joint military exercises and provide for the use of Israeli ports by the Sixth ( Mediterranean) Fleet. * Israel to agree to the pre-positioning on its territory of military supplies for use by the US rapid deployment force. * The United States to resume the delivery to Israel of American cluster bombs (temporarily suspended). * Israel to build, with partial US financial assistance, the Lavi fighter aircraft, which it was free to market abroad. (This provision was rescinded a few years later.) * US aid to Israel for military purposes to be increased by $425 million per year. * Israel and the United States to conclude a trade agreement that would allow to duty-free and tax-free imports and exports for both countries, giving Israel a preferential treatment in comparison with other US trading partners [at that time]. The agreement was developed after a few weeks of discussions between working groups of the Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Defense Department.Middle East Historic Documents  U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding: 1981 with input from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), particularly their Director of Research and Information, Steve J.

Synopsis After the Marines have defeated the Galactic Protectorate, the Empire's trade routes start being invaded by the Kierans. The Kierans are an alien race that use ships equipped with a seemingly invincible weapon that clouds the brains of the crew of the ships that try to follow them. Major Kurt Dixon is given command of a scout patrol that follows a Kieran ship to its home base, but he is \\"fogged\\" and left unconscious. Dixon's ship is equipped with an experimental computer that generates a cybernetic personality to support him on long lonely space patrols. The computer, known as Zelda, manages to land the ship on an uncharted planet, inhabited by huge organo-metallic creatures that prey on each other with awesome weaponry and computerised defences. Whilst the ship is disabled on the planet, it becomes a part of a mating process between two of these creatures. The 'sperm' of one creature homes in on the 'egg' laid by another creature. As part of a 'selection of the fittest' process, Dixon and his ship are modified, acquiring vastly improved mental and physical powers. Dixon discovers that he can now out-manoeuvre the Kierans. He realises that the entire patrol fleet can do the same thing; the newly improved fleet then proceeds to defeat the Kierans.

Milang is within the federal division of Mayo, the state electoral district of Hammond and the local government area of the Alexandrina Council. At the 2016 census, the northern part of the locality had a population of 883, of which 761 lived in its town centre. The southern part of Milang shared a population of 69 people with the locality of Point Sturt. The town was surveyed in December 1853; it became a significant port on the River Murray system between 1860 and 1880. Between December 1884 and June 1970, a branch line off the Mount Barker–Victor Harbor railway ran 13.1 km (8.1 mi) from a junction at Sandergrove to Milang, mainly for freight traffic but also as a minor passenger service. The line was dismantled after its closure in 1970. Milang played a historic role as host to the first South Australian Boy Scout camp in the summer of 1909–1910; a bronze plaque marks the location.

The Act lays down a uniform and comprehensive system of inheritance and succession into one Act. The Hindu woman's limited estate is abolished by the Act. Any property possessed by a Hindu female is to be held by her absolute property and she is given full power to deal with it and dispose it of by will as she likes. Parts of this Act was amended in 2005 by the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005.  Applicability  =As per religion= This Act is applicable to the following: * any person who is a Hindu by religion in any of its forms or developments including a Virashaiva, a Lingayat or follower of the Brahmo, Prarthana or Arya Samaj; * any person who is Buddhist, Sikh by religion; and * to any other person who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion unless it is proved that the concerned person would not have been governed by the Hindu Law or by any custom or usage as part of that law in respect of any of the matters dealt with herein if this Act had not been passed. Explanation as to who shall be considered as Hindus, Buddhists, Jains or Sikhs by religion has been provided in the section: * any child, legitimate or illegitimate, both of whose parents are Hindus, Buddhists, Jains or Sikhs by religion; * any child, legitimate or illegitimate, one of whose parents is a Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh by religion and who is brought up as a member of the tribe, community, group or family to which such parent belongs or belonged; * any person who is convert or re-convert to the Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh religion. A person shall be treated as a Hindu under the Act though he may not be a Hindu by religion but is, nevertheless, a person to whom this Act applies by virtue of the provisions contained in this section. = As per tribe = However it has been provided that not withstanding the religion of any person as mentioned above, the Act shall not apply to the members of any Scheduled Tribe within the meaning of clause (25) of article 366 of the Constitution of India unless the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, otherwise directs. Surajmani Stella Kujur Vs. Durga Charan Hansdah-SC  In the case of males  The property of a Hindu male dying intestate, or without a will, would be given first to heirs within Class I. If there are no heirs categorized as Class I, the property will be given to heirs within Class II. If there are no heirs in Class II, the property will be given to the deceased's agnates or relatives through male lineage. If there are no agnates or relatives through the male's lineage, then the property is given to the cognates, or any relative through the lineage of females. There are two classes of heirs that are delineated by the Act. Class I heirs are sons, daughters, widows, mothers, sons of a pre-deceased son, widows of a pre- deceased son, son of a, pre-deceased sons of a predeceased son, and widows of a pre-deceased son of a predeceased son. If there is more than one widow, multiple surviving sons or multiples of any of the other heirs listed above, each shall be granted one share of the deceased's property. Also if the widow of a pre-deceased son, the widow of a pre-deceased son of a pre-deceased son or the widow of a brother has remarried, she is not entitled to receive the inheritance. Class II heirs are categorized as follows and are given the property of the deceased in the following order: # Father # Son's / daughter's son # Son's / daughter's daughter # Brother # Sister # Daughter's / son's son # Daughter's / son's daughter # Daughter's / daughter's son # Daughter's /daughter's daughter # Brother's son # Sister's son # Brother's daughter  In the case of females  Under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, females are granted ownership of all property acquired either before or after the signing of the Act, abolishing their \\"limited owner\\" status. However, it was not until the 2005 Amendment that daughters were allowed equal receipt of property as with sons. This invariably grants females property rights. The property of a Hindu female dying intestate, or without a will, shall devolve in the following order: # upon the sons and daughters (including the children of any pre-deceased son or daughter) and the husband, # upon the heirs of the husband. # upon the father and mother #upon the heirs of the father, and # upon the heirs of the mother.  Certain exceptions  Any person who commits murder is disqualified from receiving any form of inheritance from the victim. If a relative converts from Hinduism, he or she is still eligible for inheritance. The descendants of that converted relative, however, are disqualified from receiving inheritance from their Hindu relatives, unless they have converted to Hinduism before the death of the relative.  Amendment  The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, amended Section 4, Section 6, Section 23, Section 24 and Section 30 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.

It is part of the School of Public Health located on the UCLouvain Brussels Woluwe campus, in Brussels, Belgium. CRED has been active for over thirty years in the fields of international disaster and conflict health studies, with research and training activities linking relief, rehabilitation and development. It promotes research, training and technical expertise on humanitarian emergencies, with a special focus on public health and epidemiology. History In 1971, Professor Michel F. Lechat, an epidemiologist at UCLouvain, initiated a research programme to study health issues in disaster situations. Two years later he established CRED as a non-profit institution with international status. Since 1980, CRED has been a World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre. Following the retirement of Professor Lechat in 1992, Professor Debarati Guha-Sapir--a researcher in the programme since 1984-- became CRED's director. Goals CRED promotes research and provides an evidence base to the international community on the burden of disease and related health issues arising from disasters and conflicts to improve preparedness and responses to humanitarian emergencies. CRED trains field managers, students, relief personnel and health professionals in the management of short- and long-term humanitarian emergencies.APHES - Assessing Public Health in Emergency Situations Focus CRED's research focuses on humanitarian and emergency situations with major impacts on human health. These include all types of natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, windstorms, famines and droughts; and human induced disasters creating mass displacement of people from civil strife and conflicts. CRED focuses on health aspects and the burden of disease arising from disasters and complex emergencies. CRED also promotes research on the broader aspects of humanitarian crises, such as human rights and humanitarian law, socio-economic and environmental issues, early warning systems, mental health care, and the special needs of women and children. CRED is actively involved in stimulating debates on the effectiveness of various humanitarian interventions. It encourages scientific and policy discussions on existing and potential interventions and their impacts on acute and chronic malnutrition, human survival, morbidity, infectious diseases, and mental health. The CRED team works in four main areas: * Natural disasters & their impacts * Conflict & health research * Database & information support * Capacity building & training The team CRED's multinational and multidisciplinary team includes experts in medicine and public health, informatics and database management, psychology, nutritional sciences, sociology, economics and geography.

He was a member, and from 1955 to 1961 chairman, of the Christian Social Union of Bavaria. Biography Seidel was born in Schweinheim, now part of Aschaffenburg, one of seven children; his parents were Johann and Christine Seidel. He was originally baptized under the name Franz Wendelin but was soon called simply Hanns. His father died when he was seven and the family had to live in relative poverty from then on. Despite those circumstances, he managed to obtain a good education. Hanns Seidel studied law in Jena, Freiburg and Würzburg, where he graduated in 1929. He worked as a lawyer in Aschaffenburg after this and married Ilse Tenter, who he had two sons with. As a strict Catholic, he joined the Bavarian People's Party in 1932. His outspokenness about the Nazis soon got him into trouble and he had to withdraw his candidacy for the Aschaffenburg town council. He briefly had to escape to Memel (now Klaipėda) in Eastern Prussia to avoid arrest but returned home soon after. He was elected to the Bavarian Landtag in 1946. Previous to this, the US occupation authorities had already made him Landrat for Aschaffenburg due to the fact that he had no previous political history in the Nazi regime. As a liberal-conservative he supported the multi-confessional fraction in his party. He became Minister for Economy in 1947 and held this post until his party's election defeat in 1954. He was an important force in the reconstruction efforts in post-war Bavaria. He was also highly regarded by the German chancellor Konrad Adenauer who unsuccessfully tried to convince him to take up a post in the federal government. In 1954, he was made speaker for the opposition, the year after, he became party chairman of the CSU, defeating Franz Josef Strauß in a highly contested party vote. He immediately went to modernize the party and its politics.Modernizing Bavaria: The Politics of Franz Josef Strauss and the CSU, 1949-1969 google book review, author: Mark S. Milosch, publisher: Berghahn Books, page 50, accessed: 10 May 2008 After the elections of 1957, he became Bavarian prime minister on 16 October 1957. He had to resign from this post on 21 January 1960 due to health reasons and died the year after, at the age of 59, in Munich. The Hanns-Seidel-Stiftung (Hanns Seidel Foundation), formed in 1967, a taxpayer-money founded political research foundation closely associated with the CSU, is named after him.

Fournier (June 1, 1908 - April 29, 1994) was a teacher, principal and political figure in New Brunswick, Canada. He represented Madawaska County in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1952 to 1960 and Restigouche—Madawaska in the House of Commons of Canada from 1961 to 1962 as a Progressive Conservative member. Fournier was named to the Senate of Canada for Madawaska-Restigouche division in 1962 and served until 1983. He was born in Saint-Basile, New Brunswick, the son of Ernest Fournier and Anna Clovette. In 1932, Fournier married Martha Thibodeau. He served in the province's Executive Council as Chairman of the Electric Power Commission. Fournier was elected to the House of Commons in a 1961 by-election held after Charles Van Horne resigned his seat. He ran unsuccessfully for reelection in 1962 and was named to the Senate in September of the same year.  Work in Senate  In 1968 Edgar Fournier was appointed Vice-Chair of the committee on poverty. The Senate reported to the 28th session of Parliament in 1970. The 241 page Report of the Special Senate Committee on Poverty included the following statements: \\"A new bill of rights for the poor must be preceded by a fundamental change in the prevailing public attitude towards those who live below the poverty level. … It is the Committee’s recommendation that the Parliament of Canada enact legislation to provide a guaranteed minimum income for all Canadians with insufficient income. This includes the elderly, the infirm, and the handicapped, female heads of families, the unemployed, those whose incomes are too low because they work in seasonal occupations, and those who are victims of jobs where the pay is insufficient to provide for their basic needs.\\" … \\"Sixty per cent of the poor are not on welfare. For them, there is not even the semblance of social justice. Consequently, there will be no good reason for their continued consent to a political, social, and economic system to which they give and from which they receive little.\\" … The existence of poverty not only deprives the poor; it impoverishes the whole economy. The inadequate participation of the poor in the economy, it has been estimated, deprives it of somewhere between one and two and one-half billion dollars a year. This represents an output that these people could have contributed to the economy if their productive capacity had been better developed and more effectively used. Additionally, there are other costs that arise directly from the social problems caused by poverty. Large expenditures for health care, welfare services, and justice will be reduced as poverty diminishes. … The Committee believes that the Canadian people whose lives are spent in a far different world are ready to face the challenge of poverty. It is a national problem, and only the national government can find a realistic and meaningful solution. It is for the citizens of Canada to demand that this be our priority project for the 1970s; a project that will stir the world’s imagination and command its respect. We need search no further for a national purpose.\\"  References  Canadian Parliamentary Guide, 1963, PG Normandin Category:1908 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick MLAs Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from New Brunswick Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Canada MPs Category:Canadian senators from New Brunswick ","title":"Edgar Fournier"},{"id":"17337665","text":"AM-906 (part of the AM cannabinoid series) is an analgesic drug which is a cannabinoid agonist.

After his first dramas, Suraag, and the socially-relevant film, Kamla, Mundhra directed, in the late 1980s and the 1990s, a string of horror and erotic thriller movies for theatrical distribution and direct to video, including The Jigsaw Murders (1988), Halloween Night (1988), Night Eyes (1990), The Other Women (1992), L.A. Goddess (1993), Sexual Malice (1994), Tales of The Kama Sutra: The Perfumed Garden (2000), and Tales of The Kama Sutra 2: Monsoon (2001). Beginning with Bawandar (2000), which he directed under the name Jagmohan, Mundhra was back to issue-oriented films. Bawander is about the fight of a poor woman for justice and was based on the story of a Rajasthani woman Bhanwari Devi. After the film's release Ashok Gehlot, the chief minister of Rajasthan called him and said, \\"Aapke bawandar ne bada bawander machaya hai.\\" He gave Rs 50,000 and land for Bhanwari Devi and also money for her son's education. To Mundhra, \\"It's not a movie about rape, but the empowerment of a woman. This character could be fictitious and yet the story would have had the same powerful message\\". In his own words, Kamla, Bawander and Provoked are his trology of strong women centric films. At the time of his death he was working on a film based on the life of Sonia Gandhi.India Times Mundhra was also a life member of International Film And Television Club of Asian Academy of Film & Television. Jag Mundhra is the father of Academy Award-nominated director/producer Smriti Mundhra. Early life Mundhra was born at Nagpur, and grew up in a Marwari locality in Calcutta, in a conservative family where films were frowned upon. He nevertheless nurtured a secret ambition to become a filmmaker. His childhood as of other Indians of his generation, was a tough one, counting pennies for the tram that rode to the other, affluent side of the city, and withstanding his family's strict traditions. Says Mundhra, \\"The family was very conservative and my grand mother was very strict and we were allowed to see maybe a couple of films a year and that too of the Har Har Mahadev variety. As a child I never saw myself as a young Marwari boy but a lot beyond that. In those days, the word global citizen was not there, but inside I felt like one\\". IIT Bombay and United States A key influence on Mundhra was his admission to the highly competitive and prestigious IIT Bombay. In his words, \\"I had studied in a Hindi medium school up to 9th grade and always admired people who spoke English fluently. IIT taught me a lot of humility. In my wing, there were students who were from different states, and as far as English went, this person from Bihar who couldn’t speak English to save his life outshone everyone else with his brilliance. I did well, but realized very early on while in IIT that engineering was not for me.

The return trip via the Suez canal normally took 70 days. Her two-cylinder single- expansion steam engines were replaced in 1873 with a more efficient but less powerful 2-cylinder compound-expansion engine, giving her a reduced top speed under steam of about .

It is native to northern parts of Europe and Asia. It was first described by the Swedish entomologist Gustaf von Paykull in 1790. Description The adult length is . This beetle is mainly black and the elytra are reddish-black and etched with fine longitudinal striations. The legs are often red. Distribution Amara alpina is a beetle of cold regions at high altitudes and high latitudes. Its range includes Norway, Sweden, Finland, Great Britain, Siberia and Mongolia. It is also present in Alaska, and it recolonised Canada after the end of the last ice age. It is believed to have survived further south in western Beringia and the northern part of the contiguous United States, and moved northwards when conditions ameliorated and the ice retreated. Behaviour In Scandinavia this beetle is often found on dwarf birch (Betula nana), dwarf willow (Salix herbacea), glacier buttercup (Ranunculus glacialis), alpine bearberry (Arctostaphylos alpina), moss bell heather (Harrimanella hypnoides), crowberry (Empetrum) and arctic wood-rush (Luzula nivalis). Amara alpina was one of three species of beetle that has been observed in Finland eating the dead bodies of other insects on snowfields.

Both countries have full embassy level diplomatic relations. Australia currently maintains an embassy in Harare, and Zimbabwe maintains an embassy in Canberra.  History  = Early history = The nations of Australia and Zimbabwe both have their origins in British colonies established as a part of the British Empire in the 18th and 19th centuries. However, while Australia experienced much white settlement from Britain and Ireland, eventually becoming a settler-dominated self-governing territory, the lands which made up Zimbabwe only became settled by Europeans from 1890, retaining a native Bantu majority. The colony of Southern Rhodesia became self-governing in 1923, but was not granted Dominion status like Australia or South Africa, and broke away from the United Kingdom in 1965, with the minority white government of Ian Smith issuing a Unilateral Declaration of Independence as the state of Rhodesia. This new state of Rhodesia, despite gaining unofficial support from apartheid South Africa and Estado Novo Portugal (until 1974), failed to gain any international recognition and became increasingly isolated. The Australian government of Robert Menzies did not recognise the declaration, noting \\"there can be no diplomatic recognition by the Australian Government of a government so formed.\\" Despite this, several backbench government MPs visited Rhodesia in a private capacity following the UDI (Dr Wylie Gibbs, James Killen, Ian Pettitt and Wilfrid Kent Hughes in 1967 and David Connolly in 1976). The Rhodesian Government maintained an office of the Rhodesian Information Service in Sydney, but from 1972, following a change in government, the Australian federal Labor government of Gough Whitlam in Canberra sought to close the office.Rhodesia Office Will Be Closed, The Age, April 3, 1972 In 1973, the federal government attempted to cut post and telephone links to the Centre, but this was ruled illegal by the full bench of the High Court. However, it remained open despite further efforts to close it under the succeeding government of Malcolm Fraser, operating under the jurisdiction of the state of New South Wales, until the Zimbabwean Government closed it in May 1980.The Nationals: The Progressive, Country, and National Party in New South Wales 1919-2006, Paul Davey, Federation Press, 2006 page 223 During the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1979, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was instrumental in convincing the then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to withhold British recognition of the government of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, prompting Britain to host the Lancaster House Agreement at which full independence and majority rule for Zimbabwe was agreed upon. At the independence celebrations in Harare in 1980, Fraser's contribution to Zimbabwean independence was firmly acknowledged. Australia established a High Commission in Salisbury on independence in 1980, with Jeremy Hearder as the first High Commissioner and Zimbabwe established a High Commission in Canberra in 1988, with Dr. Eubert Mashaire as the first High Commissioner. =21st century= Robert Mugabe, leader of Zimbabwe from independence in 1980 to 2017. Relations between the two countries began to sour when the government in Zimbabwe began its controversial land reform programme, occupying farms owned by members of Zimbabwe's white minority, sometimes by force. Following evidence of violence and intimidation in the 2002 Presidential election, Australian Prime Minister John Howard, alongside South African president, Thabo Mbeki, and the Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, led efforts which resulted in Zimbabwe's suspension (and eventual voluntary departure) from the Commonwealth of Nations in 2002–2003. In an unusually blunt declaration in 2007, Prime Minister Howard described Robert Mugabe as a \\"grubby dictator\\". Howard also called for other African countries to put pressure on Zimbabwe to crack down on the increasingly autocratic Zimbabwean government. Sporting links between the two countries were also disrupted, with the Howard government banning the Australian cricket team from taking part in a scheduled tour of the country, citing the propaganda boost that it would provide for the Mugabe régime. Howard's successor as Prime Minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd, was also critical of the Zimbabwean Government. Before the 2007 election, he criticised the People's Republic of China for providing \\"soft loans\\" to the Zimbabwean Government, and later offered aid to Zimbabwe only if the 2008 elections in that country were \\"fair\\". In December 2013 the Zimbabwean Ambassador to Australia, Jacqueline Zwambila, resigned and sought asylum in Australia due to fears of arrest should she return to Zimbabwe due to her links with official opposition there. On 22 November 2017, following Mugabe's resignation as President following a coup d'état, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop noted that Australia \\"welcomes the resignation of Zimbabwe’s Leader Robert Mugabe after 37 years of increasingly authoritarian and oppressive rule. His resignation provides an opportunity for Zimbabwe to establish proper conditions for free and fair elections to take place and to transition to an inclusive, peaceful constitutional democracy.\\" With the inauguration of a new President, Emmerson Mnangagwa, the outgoing Australian Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Suzanne McCourt, met with the president and later commented to Zimbabwe state media that the meeting was a positive sign of improving relations between the two countries.  Trade  Monthly value of Australian imports from Zimbabwe (A$ millions) since 1988 Monthly value of Australian merchandise exports to Zimbabwe (A$ millions) since 1988 Following Zimbabwean independence, bilateral trade between the two countries grew slowly. By 2007, this trade was valued at $12 million Australian dollars annually. By far the most valuable export from Zimbabwe to Australia was unprocessed tobacco, but construction materials and passenger motor vehicles were also exported. Australian exports to Zimbabwe included machinery, toys, games, sporting goods, and pottery. Despite the variety of goods being traded, neither country was a principal trading partner of the other, with Australia being ranked 34th in terms of merchandise exported by Zimbabwe, accounting for only 0.2% of total exports. In 2002, the Howard government in Australia imposed targeted sanctions against members of the Zimbabwean government in protest against the deteriorating political situation in Zimbabwe. The sanctions were extended and strengthened in 2007. These sanctions have included restrictions on travel to and through Australia for certain members of the Zimbabwean government, suspension of all non- humanitarian aid, and prohibitions on defence links. The Rudd government in 2008 considered further sanctions against Zimbabwe, with foreign minister Stephen Smith declaring that \\"I've made it clear that we are open to consider more sanctions ... We are currently giving active consideration to that issue.\\"  Zimbabwean Australians  The number of Zimbabwean settlers arriving in Australia (monthly) since 1991. *Greg Aplin, Member of the NSW Parliament for Albury since 2003.

A timber in the mill has been dated by dendrochronology to 1738-70, and the main post is even older, dating to 1533-70. In 1870, the mill was painted white and working on four common sails. The mill was modernised in the 1880s, with the original wooden windshaft being replaced by a cast iron one, and spring sails replacing the commons. Larger millstones were added. The mill was tarred at about this point, as shown by a photo dated 1890. She worked by wind until 1908, although latterly in poor condition. In 1928, the owner of the mill, Lady Castle Stewart, had the mill shored up with brick piers and steel joists below the body. These allowed the mill to survive until she could be restored. Restoration started in 1968, The mill turned by wind again in 1971, and ground grain again in 1972. In 1975, Nutley Windmill was given to the Uckfield and District Preservation Society by Lady Castle Stewart. The Windmill is featured in the 1976 concert film The Song Remains the Same, featuring the English rock band Led Zeppelin. It is the location for the night time fantasy scene starring Led Zeppelin's Bass and Keyboard Player John Paul Jones. A stock broke in 1984, while filming was being done for the children's TV programme Chocky's Children for Thames Television. A new one was fitted a week later with aid from Thames. The mill was damaged in the Great Storm of 1987, with over £6,000 worth of damage incurred. New rear steps were fitted to the mill in 1994/5, the work funded by a grant from British Telecom. Repairs to the trestle and head wheel in 1998 allowed the head stones to be worked for the first time since the mill stopped work. New sails were fitted to the mill in 2008.. Nutley Windmill featured on a postage stamp that was issued by the Royal Mail on 20 June 2017. Description The windmill with sails closed Nutley Windmill is an open trestle post mill. She has two common sails and two spring sails carried on a cast iron windshaft and is winded by a tailpole. The mill drives two pairs of millstones, arranged head and tail. The wooden head wheel and tail wheel are diameter each. Both have been converted from compass arm to clasp arm construction. The body of the mill is long and wide.

History  = Foundation = The club was founded in 1962, as heir of former local club Unione Sportiva Nissena, who lived from 1947 to 1962, and assumed the original denomination of Nissa Sport Club 1962. Former crest of Nissa FC. = Serie D = It initially played in minor amateur league before reaching Serie D in 1967, where it spent a total of five season before being relegated in 1972. It returned to play Serie D only in 1979, later starting plans for a historical enter into the world of Italian professional football. Nissa were however relegated in 1983, only to be readmitted to fill a league vacancy; it consequently decided to take advantage of the opportunity and build a strong team that promptly won the 1984 Serie D league, and finally ensuring promotion to Serie C2. = Serie C2 = Nissa's debut as a professional team came in a Coppa Italia Serie C match against Reggina, ended in a 2–2 home tie. In its first Serie C2 season, it barely escaped relegation by winning the four final matches. The following campaign was far more successful, as Nissa managed to achieve a good sixth place in the final place. However, Nissa's time into professional football came to an end in 1987, as it was relegated back to Interregionale. This was followed by a financial crisis that caused a relegation to Promozione in 1989; the club promptly returned to Interregionale the following season, but only to be canceled from football due to bankruptcy in 1992. A minor Promozione club, Caltanissetta, was consequently admitted to Eccellenza under the denomination of Nuova Nissa, being promoted to Serie D in 1995. However this club folded only three years later, in 1998, due to financial issues. = The refundation = After a year without a major football team in Caltanissetta, in 1999 minor clubs Sommatino and Nissena 1996 merged to found the current club, gaining the right to play Promozione, and immediately winning promotion to Eccellenza. In the following years, Nissa fought hard to go on its rise into the football pyramid, without succeeding in it until 2008, when it won the Girone A of Eccellenza Sicily after a long battle with Trapani. = Liquidation and another refoundation = In summer 2013 the club wasn't able to enter 2013–14 Eccellenza, after the relegation and was so subsequently liquidated. In 2014 however, it restarted in Prima Categoria Sicily under the current name.  Colors and badge  Its official colours are red and yellow.  Stadium  Stadio Marco Tomaselli (Pian del Lago), Nissa's home venue Nissa plays its home matches at Stadio Marco Tomaselli, informally known as Pian del Lago, with a capacity of 11,950. This venue also hosted an Italy national under-21 football team match in 1994, which ended in a 2–1 win for the azzurrini against Croatia national under-21 football team, but is best remembered for seeing the Italian team play with Nissa's red-coloured home shirts due to both teams having very similar jersey colours and lacking the corresponding reserve kits.

A wireless operator, Gilbert Norman arrived in November 1942 and a second operator, Jack Agazarian, arrived the following month. Transport for the Prosper network was mainly provided by Henri Déricourt. Suttill and Jack Agazarian became increasing concerned about the loyalty of Déricourt. In May 1943, Francis Suttill returned to London and he passed on his fears to Nicolas Bodington and Maurice Buckmaster. However, they were unconvinced and refused to recall Déricourt to Britain. Preparing to return to France Bodington discussed the situation with Maurice Buckmaster and left a note on record at SOE Headquarters dated 23 June 1943 concerning Dericourt, \\"we know he is in contact with the Germans and also how and why\\" (suggesting that he may have been feeding the Germans with false intelligence provided by London.Foot (1966), p.303 He was decorated as a Member of the Order of the British Empire Military Division (MBE) as Captain, Temporary Major, British Army, General List in the London Gazette dated 20 July 1943.

Accompanied by a small Special Air Service team of four men he provided useful information for RAF bombing objectives and, from 24 August, was attached to Operation Jedburgh with the \\"Arnold\\" team.Gaujac (1999), p.188 It was a mission in which SOE and similar units operated in France with the SAS behind German lines carrying out acts of sabotage. In total, 93 Jedburgh teams operated in 54 French metropolitan départements between June and December 1944.Inquimbert, Les Equipes Jedburgh: Juin 1944 – Décembre 1944, Lavauzelle, 2006 They were known by codenames which usually were first names (such as \\"Hugh\\"), with some names of medicines (such as \\"Novocaine\\") and a few random names thrown in to confuse German intelligence.Foot (1984), p.127 Bodington was recommended for a gallantry award, the Military Cross for his service in France, the recommendation recorded his previous missions to France and his return despite knowing that the Gestapo had his photograph and adds that – In the short time at his disposal Bodington arranged several receptions of arms and stores (parachuted by the Royal Air Force) to the French resistance in the Marne Department and organised guerrilla warfare against enemy garrisons and convoys passing through the area. In the St. Dizier,Gaujac (1998), p.189-191 and Chaumont regions he took part in several clashes with the enemy and showed great courage in dealing with German formations by the use of the BAZOOKA and the PIAT. After his positions had been over-run by the American advance he passed through enemy lines several times to obtain valuable intelligence. He was recommended for a Military Cross for gallantry in action in Normandy but eventually received an OBE instead.National Archives, London. Document WO 373/104/96-97 recommendation for M.C. – Major N Bodington =1945= Medaille de la resistance Bodington worked for both Special Operations Executive and also the \\"Secret Intelligence Service\\" MI6, possibly simultaneously, and as the result of internal rivalries appears to have been the victim of an internal smear campaign suggesting that he may have had wartime contact with the German Sicherheitsdienst which was not always in the best interest of his country. The National Archives in London hold a file KV2/830 documenting an investigation carried out into these claims from February to July 1945 which it classifies as : Twice decorated for bravery Captain Bodington resigned his commission on 7 July 1945 and was granted permission to retain the rank of Major. =After the war= In June 1948 he was a witness at the trial of Henri Déricourt, a French agent of SOE who was known to have had contact with the German Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo and is often regarded as having been a double or triple agent. Bodington's testimony was decisive in bringing about Dericourt's acquittal and suggests that Dericourt may have fed false intelligence to the Germans.

He was killed during the Battle of Arica. Biography Moore (sometimes spelled More in some texts) was born in Lima, the son of John Moore, a Scottish sailor and of Dolores Ruiz, a Peruvian lady. He joined the British Navy as an ensign in 1854. Later he returned to Peru and was commissioned in the Peruvian Navy. He served in the frigates Apurímac, Izcuchaca and Huaraz, as well as the Guise and the pontoon Iquique. In 1866, during the Chincha Islands War, he was appointed commander of the corvette Unión. A few months later, Captain Moore took a Peruvian Navy crew to the United States to bring the ironclad Atahualpa to Peru. The monitor sailed from New Orleans, La. in early January 1869 arriving in Peru in June 1870. As a reward, he was appointed as commander of the frigate Independencia and in 1877, General Commander of the Southern Fleet. As such he directed the actions to recapture the monitor Huáscar which had been captured by Nicolás de Piérola and had rebelled against the central government. During the War of the Pacific between Chile and Peru, he was appointed commander of the strongest unit of the Peruvian Navy, the armoured frigate Independencia. As such, he participated in the Battle of Punta Gruesa on 21 May 1879, when his ship crashed with a submarine rock while pursuing the Chilean schooner Covadonga, commanded by Captain Carlos Condell. He was rescued from his sinking ship, imprisoned in Arica and court martialled by his own comrades. He was dismissed from the navy and forbidden to ever wear his uniform again. He decided to continue the war as a simple civilian, in order to regain his lost honor. On 27 February 1880, during the Sea Battle of Arica, while in command of the Manco Capac, he successfully disabled the captured Huascar killing her commander Captain Manuel Thomson. During the siege of Arica, he was in charge of the batteries of the Cape, where he was killed during the Battle of Arica.

Denby Common and Codnor Breach are outlying hamlets on the western edge of the village. History The name Loscoe derives from Old Norse words lopt and skógr, as in lopt í skógi, meaning \\"loft in a wood\\" or \\"wood with a loft house\\". It was recorded as Loscowe in 1277. Loscoe Manor formed part of the wider Draycott Estate; Richard and William de Draycott were recorded at Loscoe (or Loschowe) in 1401. The manor house was demolished in 1704. Loscoe's economy in the 19th and 20th centuries was dominated by coal mining: pit chimneys and slag heaps were prominent. Three mines operated: Old Loscoe (early 1830s – 1933), Bailey Brook (1847–1938) and Ormonde (1908–1970). Loscoe was in the ecclesiastical parish of Heanor until 1844, when a church was built between Loscoe and neighbouring Codnor to the north, and a joint parish created for them. Loscoe became a separate parish in 1927. Services were held in the mission church until a new parish church, dedicated to St Luke, was completed in 1938. Loscoe was the site of a landfill gas migration explosion on 24 March 1986. Although there were no fatalities, one house was destroyed by the blast and its three occupants injured. The atmospheric pressure on the night of the explosion fell 29 hPa (29 mbar) over a seven-hour period, causing the gas to be released from the ground in much greater quantities than usual. In the four hours before the explosion at approximately 6.30 am, the local meteorological office had recorded average falls of 4 hPa (4 mbar) per hour. Several cubic metres of landfill gas (consisting of a 3:2 mixture of methane and carbon dioxide) collected underground near the house at 51 Clarke Avenue, and as the gas expanded it flowed into the space beneath the floor, from where it was drawn by convection to the gas central-heating boiler and ignited. The incident led to the introduction of key British legislation and government guidance, with research into landfill behaviour and revised best practice at landfill sites.DoE Report CWM039A+B/92 Young, A. (1992) These moves were designed to vent gas into the atmosphere over time, then to burn off methane, and eventually in the most productive sites, to use gas turbines to turn the gas into electric power for the national grid. Demography In the 2011 census the electoral ward of Heanor and Loscoe (covering Loscoe and north-western parts of Heanor) had 2,285 dwellings, 2,216 households and a population of 5,335. The average age of residents was 40.5 (39.3 for England as a whole) and 17.9 per cent were aged 65 or over (16.4 per cent for England as a whole). Governance For representation within Heanor and Loscoe Town Council and Amber Valley Borough Council, Heanor and Loscoe civil parish is divided into three electoral wards: Heanor East, Heanor West and Heanor and Loscoe. In the May 2019 Parish Council elections, the Heanor and Loscoe Ward obtained seven seats, made up of four Labour and three Conservative candidates.

In the 1950s he traveled to the UK but did not take the opportunity to attend Art School. Instead, he continued to sell his works, eventually buying a car, which became both his gallery and means of transport. He became an habitué and favourite of the basement clubs and jazz bars of Soho. His artistic education, such as it was, consisted of frequent visits to museums and art galleries where he picked up his technique. On returning to Jamaica in the 1970s, he started building a large house in Fisherman's Park, Long Bay, Portland. Six stories high with circular staircases and a vast studio, it was half castle and half temple, surrounded by a high wall. Here he settled with his common-law wife and two sons.

History  Rigas in Wien Contacts between the Greeks and the Austrians can be led back in the aristocracy of the Middle Ages. Great economic importance and social acknowledgment attained the Greeks in Austria in the 19th century. The Greek Johannes Theodat opened on January, 17th 1685 Vienna's first coffee house. In 1700 four Greeks had the privilege to serve coffee in public. In the 18th century, Vienna was the centre of Greek diaspora where persons like Rigas Feraios, Anthimos Gazis, Neophytos Doukas and the Ypsilantis family prepared the Greek Revolution. The first Greek newspaper was printed there and the Hellenic National School in Vienna is today the oldest such in the world that has remained continuously in operation. In 20th century Austria (and especially Graz and Linz) was a popular destination for Greek students.  Architectural Heritage The Greek-Austrian magnate Georgios Sinas (father of Simon Sinas) invited the Danish architect Theophil Hansen who worked in Athens (and had designed there major public buildings like the Zappeion and the Academy of Athens) to design for him some new buildings for his companies in Austria. Other Greek Austrians like Nikolaus Dumba and Ignaz von Ephrussi also gave Hansen contracts for buildings in the Classical Greek style and the Gräzisierter-Neorennaissance-Stil. After Works like the Palais Ephrussi and the Palais Dumba Hansen was famous and build many other public buildings in Austria like the Parliament of Austria and the Musikverein.

Because he was mentioned by Pliny the Elder, he is one of the earliest artists in Europe for which a contemporary biography survives. Biography Famulus and assistants from his studio covered a large amount of the Domus Aurea wall with frescoes. Pliny, in his Natural History, recounts how Famulus went for only a few hours each day to the Golden House, to work while the light was right. Pliny the Elder presents him as one of the principal painters of the domus aurea: > More recently, lived Amulius, a grave and serious personage, but a painter > in the florid style. By this artist there was a Minerva, which had the > appearance of always looking at the spectators, from whatever point it was > viewed. He only painted a few hours each day, and then with the greatest > gravity, for he always kept the toga on, even when in the midst of his > implements. The Golden Palace of Nero was the prison-house of this artist's > productions, and hence it is that there are so few of them to be seen > elsewhere.\\"Pliny the Elder, Natural History, xxxv.120 The Domus Aurea frescoes' effect on Renaissance artists was profound; it can be seen most obviously in Raphael's decoration for the loggias in the Vatican. The white walls, delicate swags, and bands of frieze -- framed reserves containing figures or landscapes -- have returned at intervals ever since, notably in late 18th century Neoclassicism, making Famulus one of the most influential painters in the history of art. Art historian Nunzio Giustozzi writes that Famulus painted in Style IV, impressionist-like coloring with deep blue, green, indigo, purple, and cinnabar red, including motion and animation in the artwork. Famulus is credited with large mythological scenes, now lost, much like the large panel Achilles at Skyros.

After obtaining a degree in law, Carfagna worked for several years on Italian television shows and as a model. She later entered politics and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for Forza Italia party in 2006. From 2008 to 2011 she served as Minister for Equal Opportunity in Berlusconi IV Cabinet. Carfagna had been named \\"the most beautiful minister in the world\\", and was ranked number one on Maxim's \\"World's Hottest Politicians\\". She's spokeswoman of the parliamentary group of Forza Italia at Chamber of Deputies.  Early life  Carfagna was born in Salerno, where she attended the Liceo scientifico Giovanni da Procida. In 2001 she graduated in law from the University of Salerno, with a thesis on information law and broadcasting systems. = Career as showgirl and model = After having studied dance and piano, she participated in the Miss Italy contest in 1997, finishing in sixth place. About the experience she later said: \\"That competition makes you as a woman, it matures you...all that stress, that desire to win, it makes you understand who you are.\\" Later she started working in television for the company Mediaset, controlled by the family of Silvio Berlusconi. From 2000 to 2006 she participated as a showgirl in the television program La domenica del villaggio (\\"Sunday in the Village\\") with Davide Mengacci. In 2006 she led the program Piazza grande (\\"Main Square\\") together with Giancarlo Magalli. Carfagna has also been part of the television programs I cervelloni, Vota la voce and Domenica in. Mara Carfagna has posed for Maxim calendar. She states that she is a firm believer in family values, and claimed in an interview that she once refused to take part in a movie directed by erotic filmmaker Tinto Brass, when she was twenty years old.  Political career  =2000s: Forza Italia and The People of Freedom= Mara Carfagna and the Minister of Youth Policy Giorgia Meloni with the President of the Italian Republic Giorgio Napolitano in 2009 Carfagna entered politics in 2004, and became responsible for the women's movement in the political party Forza Italia. In the elections of 2006 she was elected into the Chamber of Deputies for Forza Italia, and in the 2008 elections – running as the third candidate from The People of Freedom in the district \\"Campania 2\\" – she was reelected. When she first entered parliament Berlusconi jokingly commented that Forza Italia practiced the law of primae noctis; the right of a feudal lord to take the virginity of his female subjects. As a deputy she was secretary of the Commission for Constitutional Affairs, and has been described as a diligent, hard-working parliamentarian. On 8 May 2008 she was appointed Minister for Equal Opportunity, in the fourth cabinet of Silvio Berlusconi, an appointment that was widely publicised internationally, with focus on her special background. In September 2008, Carfagna introduced proposal for a new law making street prostitution a crime, with fines for both clients and prostitutes. The bill was her first major initiative as a minister. She said that at present in Italy, \\"as in the great majority of Western countries\\", brothels and the exploitation of prostitutes by pimps were illegal but prostitution as such was not. She described street prostitution as a \\"shameful phenomenon\\". In 2009 she became the first political promoter of the law against stalking offence. This law was finally approved on 23 February 2009, introduced as a package of bills known as the Decreto Maroni. In the same year she signed a campaign against homophobia in Italy, with television spots, images on magazines and wall attachments on cities. She has participated in many international conferences, met the UN Secretary General, has intervened four times to the General Assembly, where she promoted an international moratorium against FGM. She organized the first international conference on violence against women in the context of the G8, which was held in the city of L'Aquila, in Italy, in July 2009. =2010s: Forza Italia revival= Mara as Member of the Chamber of Deputies in 2013 In 2010 during political debate for the International Women's Day celebration Mara made a political gaffe, claiming that women gained the right to vote in Italy in 1960 (while they did in 1946) and that the law that rules intrahousehold relationship was reformed in 1970 (while it was in 1975). In the 2010 Campania regional election Mara Carfagna had a record result of 55,695 preferences. In 2011, Mara proposed a law, which was passed, that provided quotas for women on the boards of companies, which has allowed to involve a larger number of women in the Italian economic system. It approved funding for childcare facilities and in support of motherhood and family that made it possible to increase by a few percentage points the availability of places for working mothers. That same year Carfagna also supported a bill against homophobia, in which homophobia was considered as an aggravating circumstance in bullying events. This bill was then rejected by the People of Freedom majority in the Parliament, causing Carfagna's disappointment. In 2013, Silvio Berlusconi founded Forza Italia, an ideological revival of the eponymous party that existed in the 1994–2009 period. Mara joined the party, following Berlusconi. In the same year she began a relationship with ex–deputy Alessandro Ruben. In the 2016 Italian local elections, Carfagna was the most voted Forza Italia candidate in Naples, with more than 5,500 personal preferences. In November 2018, on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, Mara Carfagna launched a campaign called \\"Non è normale che sia normale\\" (\\"It's not normal that it's normal\\") involving many parliamentarians of all political parties, VIPs and personalities of sport and entertainment. In August 2019, the Codice Rosso (\\"Red Code\\") legislation, proposed by Carfagna, enters into force in Italy to combat violence against women with more efficient investigations and more severe penalties.  Political views and controversies  Gay pride protest against Carfagna in Catania, 2008. Carfagna has been vocal on certain issues, such as the level of crime in her home town of Salerno, after having herself been the victim of burglary on three occasions. In 2007 Mara opposed gay marriage, and said that matrimonial rights should be tied to reproduction. In May 2008 she refused to back a gay pride march, arguing that discrimination was no longer a problem for homosexuals in Italy because homophobia was just a thinking offence, a statement that was strongly criticized by gay rights groups. In May 2010, during the Quirinal Palace ceremony on the occasion of International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, Carfagna publicly apologized for the statements she made two years earlier, saying \\"she was helped in breaking through the wall of mistrust of which she was at the same time victim and unconscious responsible\\". In January 2007, Carfagna was at the center of a controversy that received international attention. On the evening of the Telegatto award show, Berlusconi said about Carfagna: \\"If I was not already married I would have married her immediately\\". The comment caused Berlusconi's wife, Veronica Lario, to demand an apology through a national newspaper, something which she also received. Carfagna herself has later described the comment as \\"gallant and harmless,\\" and said that she did not quite understand Lario's reaction. On 2 July 2008 the Italian newspaper la Repubblica interviewed the former vice- minister of Foreign Affairs in the Berlusconi II Cabinet and socialist executive Margherita Boniver, who admitted the existence of some compromising private phone calls about Berlusconi. Few days later, the Argentine journal Clarín reported about telephone wiretap records authorized for an anti- corruption investigation. Reporter Julio Algañaraz wrote that Carfagna and Silvio Berlusconi engaged in a telephone conversation with explicit sexual allusions and regarding a meeting about sexual services. In November 2008 Italian journalist Paolo Guzzanti wrote on his blog about Carfagna, saying: \\"Is it admissible or ineligible, in a hypothetical democracy, that the head of a government nominate a minister who has the one and only merit of having him personally served, excited and satisfied?\\", thus highlighting the words spoken by his daughter Sabina Guzzanti at \\"No Cav Day\\" anti-Berlusconi protest movement in July 2008. Carfagna sued la Repubblica for having reported Sabina Guzzanti's words that alluded to her sexual activity with Berlusconi. In October 2012 the \\"Civil Court of Rome\\" condemned Sabina Guzzanti to compensation of €40,000 to Carfagna. On June 25, 2020, Mara Carfagna, as vice president of the Chamber of Deputies, ordered the forced expulsion of the Hon. Vittorio Sgarbi who, pronouncing himself on the decree amending the law containing urgent measures concerning criminally relevant wiretapping, pronounced the following: \\"If a criminal commits a crime is normal, but if a Judge does it, it's an institutional earthquake.

It was one of the first clashes of the 1982 Lebanon War, and resulted in the IDF capturing the castle. Background Located 717 meters above sea level, Beaufort Castle commands great parts of the Upper Galilee and South Lebanon.Schiff and Yaari (1984), p. 124 It could be used to direct artillery, and even Syria had sent artillery spotters there. Israel shelled the fortress repeatedly, but could never actually enter it - the massive basalt rocks of the Medieval construction proving an effective defense even in face of modern artillery and aerial bombardments. For Israel, it had become a symbol of the Palestinian power over the region. For the Palestinians, it served as a memento of Saladin's victory over the Crusaders in 1192 and of their own endurance against Israel,Fisk (2001), p. 54 and the PLO used it as the colophon on leaflets. Two weeks before the war started, Yasser Arafat visited the castle, sat down with its defenders and assured them that in thirty-six hours of fighting, the PLO could get a ceasefire. The sector commander protested, insisting that there was no way they could withstand an Israeli attack for so long.Schiff and Yaari (1984), pp. 95-96 Preparations for the attack The IDF Northern Command had been planning to capture the Beaufort for a long time before the war, designating the mission to Sayeret Golani, the commando unit of the Golani Brigade. The unit studied the castle and trained for tactics to conquer it. However, the way the invasion progressed rendered the capture of the Beaufort unnecessary. Capture would have been necessary had the IDF decided to cross the Litani River via the al- Khardali Bridge, just below the fortress. But since the IDF instead decided to use the Akiye Bridge, located much further to the west, the Israelis could have proceeded to Nabatiye unaffected by the Beaufort. Since the PLO troops stationed in and around the castle were not firing at Israeli settlements when the war began, there was no urgent need to neutralize them. The General Staff issued a command to postpone the operation, but the command failed to reach the Sayeret.Schiff and Yaari (1984), pp. 124-125 The Sayeret former commander, Giora (Guni) Harnik had been discharged from the IDF just a week earlier, but was suddenly called back. Since the unit commander, Moshe Kaplinsky, was reported wounded while on the road, Harnik was sent as replacement. He drove there so fast that his APC flipped over, although he and the other passengers were uninjured. His surprise return was a morale boost for the men of the unit. His deputy was Mordechai (Moti) Goldman.Schiff and Yaari (1984), pp. 126-127 The unit consisted of 23 men, and the supporting engineering company of sixty-five.Schiff and Yaari (1984), p. 127 Zeev Schiff and Ehud Yaari report that fifteen Palestinians were stationed at the Beaufort at the start of the war.Schiff and Yaari (1984), p. 125 Some of them may have escaped before the battle started. The battle At first, a daylight attack was planned, but as the war went behind schedule, a night attack became the preferred option. The column began to move at 4:00 PM. As darkness fell, Harnik ordered his drivers to turn on their lights as they approached the castle to get there faster, and then ordered them to disembark from the APCs and prepare for an assault on foot. They were to take the northern outpost and its trenches while the supporting engineering company would take the southern outpost. The first dash up the asphalt road met with heavy machine gun fire which killed two soldiers and wounded four more. A few moments later, Mordechai Goldman, an Israeli officer and personal deputy to Harnik and seven other men began a second assault. Goldman and two others reached the main trench, encountering a Palestinian and killed him. The two other soldiers tried to jump over the trench but were cut down. Goldman moved farther along the trench, threw a grenade into it and then jumped down and killed the Palestinian fighter. Since his magazine was almost empty by then, he picked up the dead Palestinian's AK-47. He then climbed out of the trench and ran alongside it. He killed another Palestinian before being joined by Harnik and two other soldiers. Harnik and Goldman then came across a lone Palestinian, entrenched in a concrete position. The Palestinian managed to kill Harnik with a bullet to the chest before Goldman threw an explosive charge at his position, killing the Palestinian fighter and destroying the position. Another soldier was killed by the time the engineering company went into action.Schiff and Yaari (1984), pp. 128-129 Most of the remaining Palestinians were killed as Israeli troops secured the mountain. Because of both weather conditions and continued firing nearby, medical evacuation was delayed until shortly before daybreak. Only then, did the death toll - six men, including the unit commander - become apparent. After it, the soldiers spread out and climbed to take the roof of the fortress, which turned out to be empty. Several Palestinians may have escaped during the night. By 6:30 AM, Israeli control over the castle was secured. Aftermath During the day, the Chief of Staff (Ramatkal), Rafael Eitan, visited the troops and was astounded to learn of the death toll. Later that day, Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Minister of Defense Ariel Sharon arrived, accompanied by newsmen and photographers. They did not know about the losses, as Sharon did not inquire before declaring that the battle was won without casualties on the Israeli side.Schiff and Yaari (1984), pp. 129-131 Showing interest in the Palestinian resistance, Begin asked \\"Did they have machine guns?\\", a question which later became a symbol of how uninformed the Israeli leadership was of the events on the front throughout the war. Harnik was posthumously given the division commander citation. The commander of the Golani Brigade later confessed that in retrospect, he would not have attacked the Beaufort.Schiff and Yaari (1984), p. 129 An investigation was held after the war as to why the order to postpone the operation failed to reach its destination, but produced inconclusive results.

Sumy The Blessed Virgin Mary Annunciation Parish in Sumy The history of comparatively new Roman Catholic parish in town Sumy is dramatic. Ordeals had fallen to its lot while Ukraine's stay in the body of Soviet Union. At the end of the 19th century Sumian Roman Catholics had decided to build their own temple and received permission in 1900 with the aid of famous Sumian Maecenas Paul Kharitonenko (1853–1914), at whose sugar-refineries, the largest in Europe and Russia \\"Love Sumy Insomuch As I Do\\" (article; translation; original text in Ukrainian see in: \\"Good Day\\", Sumy, newspaper, #29; June 28, 1996; p.5 (\\"Добрий день\\", Сумська газета, №29, 28 червня 1996 р.; с.5)): \\"Production of sugar-refineries of company \\"I.G.

In 1912 P. Kharitonenko possessed 8 sugar-refineries. These were: the largest in Russia and Europe Pavlov's sugar-refinery in Sumy, that every year produced 5 million puds (80 million kg) of lump-sugar; sugar-refineries — Vyrovsky, Natalian, Parkhomian, Ugroedian, Yankovorovsky (Kharkiv province); Krasnoyarusky (Kursk province); Chanovsky (Chernigov province). Pavel Ivanovich also was the largest shareholder of Tsiglyarovsky sugar company. Used the largest personal credit of the State Bank — 9 million roubles. In 1914 to P. Kharitonenko belonged 10 sugar-refineries, about 30 thousand tithes of leasehold for crops of sugar roots. Factories of Pavel Ivanovich were assessed at 60 million roubles, and supplied sugar to the North and South of Russia, Siberia, where he had storage at greatest cities. And not only in Russia, but also abroad, specifically in Iran, Europe, USA too, where Kharitonenko competed with Cuban sugar manufacturers.\\" worked many specialists from Europe, chiefly Roman Catholics from Poland and the Czech Republic.Religious Information Service of Ukraine The Blessed Virgin Mary Annunciation Church, performed in Gothic style, had been founded in 1901. \\"Unfortunately all attempts to find information about the building process as well as its interior have been unsuccessful\\" 2008\\\\.

Consecrated in 1911, by Jan Tsepliak, bishop of Mogilev, the Blessed Virgin Mary Annunciation Church had been closed down by the authorities in two decades, and was used for improper purpose. It's enough to say, that after the World War II during 50 years there were situated first a museum, then a gym. Only after the disintegration of USSR the temple had been retrieved to regenerate Roman Catholic parish and in spring 1998 had been solemnly reconsecrated. The first masses (1911–1915) at the temple were led by parish priest Fr. Theodor Ryllo. He also gave lessons in religion in Alexander High School, 1st and 2nd High Schools, technical educational institution and Military College in Sumy and in High School in Lebedin. His successor (1916–1919) on the post had become chaplain Fr. A. Krzhivitsky, whose assistants during festivities were Fr. Florian Garaburda and Fr. Jozef Varpekhovsky. The last registration thereat had been on 1919 November 20. Archive documents witness that 1926, February 21 believers had met to create parish council and commission for inspections. The last Mass, before the temple had been closed down, had been held in 1932 by Fr. Vagonis. Some Masses conducted during the World War II. Reformation, proclaimed by Mikhail Gorbachev, had enabled believers to begin struggle for reviving in the town Roman Catholic parish. And soon, after Ukraine had found independence, at the end of 1991 parish had begun its activity.Sotnik A. N. This is our history. Chronicle-documentary work on religious life in Sumian Land in connection with history of Christianity in Ukraine. Rovno: Svitankova Zorja, 1997; p. 144. At the beginning parishioners gathered on services, once in two weeks (1991-August 1992) conducted by parish priest of the Blessed Virgin Mary Assumption Church in Kharkiv Fr. George Zyminsky, directly on the temple's stairs. Already after returning the temple to the parish, ill-wishers, it happened, turned out the light while service. The first priest (September 1992-February 1995) of new parish had been appointed priest from Zhytomirian Diocese Fr. Vitaly Skomarovsky. While his cadence in May 1994 the temple had been retrieved. Next two parish priests had become Fr. Gennadius Bilinsky (March 1995-September 1997) and Fr. Felix Svintsitsky (September 1997-August 1999). During service of the latter the temple had been reconsecrated by the Zhytomyrian bishop Jan Purvinsky in 1998, March 25. Fourth parish priest (September 1999-June 2006) had been Fr. Stanislav Tanatarov. For the celebration of the 2000th anniversary of Christmas, in the temple's courtyard, from its left hand, had been erected the Jesus Sacred Heart Chapel (about 4 metres high). Bronze statue of Blessed Virgin Mary with Infant in Her Arms, bathing in vivid verdure of peaceful and cozy square, from the left side of temple and edifice behind it, where the residence of parish priest and Roman Catholic religious mission are accommodated, attracts every eye. Standing on red brick pedestal with quadrilateral base of black stone, surrounded by flowers, grass and trees, thoroughly polished figure always reminds all of the Sacramental. From 2002 the canteen at the temple functions by efforts of members of the Secular Franciscan Order, filial of which functions at the parish since spring of 1999. Fr. Arthur Surovsky (at left) and behind him Fr. Voicheck Stasevich (in center) at the Mass His successors had become parish priest Fr. Arthur Surovsky (since 2006) and present parish priest Fr. Voicheck Stasevich (since August 2008) (both of them you can see on the photo at left). Now at the temple are successfully developing Sunday School (with the aid of pious nuns), library, theatre, museum, spiritual music band, diverse sections and circles (including spiritual culture circles). Caritas Spes Sumy emblem To help those who haven't been lucky in life, the Blessed Virgin Mary Annunciation parish had founded a Roman Catholic mission \\"Caritas Spes Sumy\\", that acts at the temple as branch of All-Ukrainian Roman Catholic religious mission \\"Caritas Spes Ukraina\\". On February 6, 2008, and April 15, 2008, had been created web-sites of mission and parish under titles \\"Caritas Spes Sumy\\" and \\"Ave Maria\\" to elucidate their activities in religious spheres. To support this aim parish publicates bulletin, named \\"Ave!\\", informing about Church's history and life of the parish. Unfortunately, on September 29, 2008, web-sites of mission and parish \\"Caritas Spes Sumy\\" and \\"Ave Maria\\" had been closed by decision of new parish administration. A little later parish had opened its new web-site To the Glory of Jesus Christ On January 15, 2009, author of former web-sites of mission and parish \\"Caritas Spes Sumy\\" and \\"Ave Maria\\" had created site of the Sumian Historical Web-Society under the title \\"Ave Maria\\" to elucidate different historical subjects, including the history of religion and church. Romny The tragic history of the Blessed Virgin Mary Annunciation temple in Sumy in no case was just a regrettable exception, but shows a striking example of widespread disastrous practice of persecuting Roman Catholic Church in Soviet Union. Like a long-suffering Sumian parish, had stood a severe test temple of Immaculate Conception of Virgin Mary in Romny. In a short period after the Russian civil war of 1917-20s, this one, made in Roman architectural style, had been confiscated. Chapel, built from the left side, had been subjected to the total destruction. About its existence nothing reminds, but a strait stripe of wrecked wall, in the past joined chapel with the temple. The latter for decades in the known way also wasn't used for proper purpose (Ministry of Education had turned over it at disposal of polytechnic secondary school, that housed inside received premises workshops). The Immaculate Conception of Virgin Mary temple in Romny (nowadays) Restored Roman Catholic parish could be contented with very little, because open-air divine services were conducted across the street in the courtyard, belonged to a married couple, who'd become parishioners, by priest, come from Sumy at the appointed time. Very difficult task to return temple to the lawful owner, The Holy See, Fr. Stanislav Tanatarov, appointed to Sumy in September 1999, didn't ever consider impossible and at once on a special conference, convened in Romny, had proclaimed his aspiration to reconsecrate the temple. He'd succeeded in getting free the first floor in church, then Fr. Stanislav had liberated ground floor, minister's house and other edifices. Konotop The Our Lady of Fatima parish in Konotop (Ukraine) The Our Lady of Fatima parish, third in Sumian Roman Catholic deanery, had passed through a long way while in 2005 in Konotop had appeared and been consecrated a new Roman Catholic temple, built in modern style. The place, called by local inhabitants as \\"seven winds\\", now is one of town sights owing to Jeff Woolthy, a young member of the Holy Apostles parish from Colorado Springs (which continually renders its Sumian coreligionists help). He'd made the rich donation to the Our Lady of Fatima parish in memory of his prematurely deceased wife. The present parish priest in Konotop is Fr. Zbignev. Shostka The center of the fourth parish, chapel, named in honour of St. Joseph, now is situated in the private house in Shostka. The present parish priest there is Fr. Thomas.

He built his reputation in the Fascist paramilitary group known as the Blackshirts, and later rose to the position of party secretary, second only to Benito Mussolini in authority over Fascist Italy. His brief and rocky tenure began in the spring of 1943 and ended with the party's collapse and abolition at the end of July.  Life  Born in the town of Paola, Scorza participated in World War I in the Bersaglieri corps where he reached the rank of Tenente (lieutenant). After the war he joined Benito Mussolini's National Fascist Party and participated in acts of violence against communists and socialists in the area around Lucca. After participating in the March on Rome, he worked for a brief time as a journalist, then he was named Federale (chief provincial party officer) of the Province of Lucca. In 1930, Scorza was appointed to direct the key Party youth organization, Gruppo Universitario Fascista. The following year he was named as a member of the Direttorio (a high national body) of the National Fascist Party. He strongly opposed the Azione Cattolica and his behavior forced Mussolini to dismiss him from the Direttorio. He participated in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War and the Spanish Civil War. In 1940 he came back to national political activities.  Secretary of PNF  In April 1943, Scorza was named Secretary of the National Fascist Party, replacing the ineffectual Aldo Vidussoni. He remained fully dedicated to Mussolini and he assumed his office with an uncompromising demand – \\"Everybody and everything for the war.\\" Despite his enthusiasm, Scorza failed in his efforts to revitalize the party. On 25 July 1943, the President of the Italian wartime Parliament, Dino Grandi, put forth to the Fascist Grand Council a motion to remove Mussolini from office. Scorza, who also held the position of Secretary of the Grand Council, voted against it, but the motion carried and Mussolini was arrested by the Carabinieri. After the Italian armistice, Scorza was arrested in the Nazi-controlled Italian Social Republic. He was charged with treason for failing to counter the anti-Fascist coup d'état, but he was acquitted by a special tribunal in April 1944.  Later life  At the end of World War II, Scorza fled to Argentina. He was tried in absentia by the Allies and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment. He was later granted amnesty and he returned to Italy in 1955. Scorza died in Florence on 23 December 1988.  References  Further reading * Montanelli, Indro, (2003). Storia d'Italia.

It has two titular sequels, Art of the Devil 2 (2005) and Art of the Devil 3 (2008), but these films feature a different story with new characters. Plot Art of the Devil tells the story of Boom (Supaksorn Chaimongkol), a young Thai girl who meets a married man named Prathan (Tin Settachoke) at a country club. The two soon begin an affair, and Boom finds herself pregnant. When she breaks the news to Prathan, he appears to settle for giving her a sum of money in exchange for her silence, reassuring her that he will not leave her. However, he then wakes her up in the middle of the night, informing her that for that large an amount of money, he had the right to share her. While Prathan wields a video camera, his friends chase a terrified and screaming Boom out of the room and onto the beach, where they apparently gang-rape her. After getting an ultrasound at the hospital, Boom shows up at the restaurant where Prathan's daughter is celebrating her birthday and informs him that the sum of money he had given her was not enough. He pulls her outside and hits her, tossing a wad of cash at her and warning her not to come near his family again. Furious, Boom enlists the aid of a black magic user to exact revenge on her ex-lover and his entire family, notably causing the eldest son to shoot his girlfriend and his little sister before turning the gun on himself. After their deaths, Boom visits a temple and finds that if she donates coffins for the spirits, they will not bother her. She makes some offerings. While leaving the temple, she sees the ghosts of her victims in the back of a car and steps off of the sidewalk to get a better look, whereupon she is hit by a car. The accident causes her to lose her baby. Prathan's first wife inherits his fortune. She and her four children move into the house. Boom again uses black magic to kill this new family off. However, her motive this time is not for revenge, but in order to claim the inheritance. A young newspaper reporter becomes suspicious, so Boom arranges for his death, as well. Throughout this, the ghost of Boom's dead daughter is seen around the house. The story ends with only the youngest son and eldest daughter surviving the massacre.

Christian Mission A member of Emmanuel Baptist church in San Salvador, Gómez was a national leader both of Baptist women and in the teachers' union.Pixley, Jorge 'Baptists and liberation theology: Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean'. From: Baptist History and Heritage January 1, 2000 She was a founder of the National Coordination of Salvadoran Women (CONAMUS), an organization of women founded in 1986. Since then, CONAMUS has addressed the issues which directly affect poor women in El Salvador, including domestic violence and rape, economic survival, lack of political participation, and social inequality. In 1989 CONAMUS opened a clinic to respond to women who were victims of domestic violence and rape. In her spare time Gómez went out into the local villages and taught the peasant women how to read. She did this so that they in turn could teach their children how to read but also so that they could read health and farming leaflets in order to improve the quality of their lives. However, some in authority became concerned that the previously illiterate peasants would now be able to read about their rights, and would begin to demand them.Isabel Ramírez, 'Opening a Door to Women in El Salvador' EPICA website She was found dead on the side of the road after being abducted. Abduction and murder According to witnesses, on April 5, 1989 as Gómez was returning from the John F. Kennedy School in Ilopango, El Salvador, heavily armed men dressed in civilian clothing forced her into a van. Two hours later she was found dead on the side of a main road. On examination, her body showed signs of torture and burns, most likely caused by chemicals such as acid; she had been beaten in the face, and acid marks on her shoulders were found. There were four bullets in her indicating that she had been shot. The murdered teacher had been taken from an area that was the operational base for the Salvadoran Air Force. General Juan Rafael Bustillo, the then-head of the Salvadoran Air Force, has been implicated in the murder.Notorious Salvadoran School of the Americas Graduates The National Association of Salvadoran Educators (ANDES) has stated that General Bustillo had publicly threatened Gómez on previous occasions.Radio Venceremos (RV), the Official Voice of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front from El Salvador Weekly Report 04-03-89 to 04-10-1989International Socialist Review Issue 9, Fall 1999 ANDES ordered a two-day shutdown of all educational activities to protest Gómez's murder and demanded that the country's chief prosecutor begin proceedings to bring those responsible to justice. Leaders of the National Union of Salvadorean Workers (UNTS) also said they believed Bustillo had ordered the killing. An organisation known as the Movement for Bread, Work, Land and Liberty (MPTL) staged a protest, calling on the people to resist the new nationwide wave of repression that marked the weeks following the Nationalist Republican Alliance's (ARENA) electoral victory. The protesters ended their march at the vigil that was held for the murdered schoolteacher. In its defense, the Salvadoran government denied any involvement, stating instead that the apparent intent behind Gómez's abduction and murder was primarily to discredit the Air Force (which is in charge of the area in which the murder occurred). Government officials added that Gómez had never been officially arrested by any government agency, and that she had never even been questioned by the authorities.Complaints against the Government of El Salvador presented by the European Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), etc, Report No:268 Case(s) No(s):1494 Legacy After her death, her church commissioned a local artist to paint a wooden cross with scenes from Gómez's life, portraying her work among the poor women of El Salvador.

He played a central role in the talks leading up to and during President Richard M. Nixon's historic 1972 visit to China. His memoir, The Man on Mao's Right, was published in July 2008, by Random House. Early years in U.S. Ji was born on July 30, 1929, in Shanxi Province to an affluent family who were also sympathetic to the Communist Party. His father was a wealthy landlord, lawyer, and provincial official, while his eldest brother, Ji Chaoding, was a noted economist who earned a Ph.D. at Columbia University. Ji and his family fled their home in Taiyuan, the provincial capital, in the late 1930s during the Second Sino-Japanese War. At the urging of Zhou Enlai, a young revolutionary at the time, Ji's family emigrated to New York City in 1939, when Ji was nine years old. He earned a high school diploma from Horace Mann-Lincoln High School (now known as Horace Mann School), and attended Camp Rising Sun in 1944. He was a sophomore at Harvard University in 1950 when the Korean War broke out, which saw his native homeland and his adopted country fight on opposite sides. Ji described how he \\"was torn between [his] love for two countries\\", but knew that he \\"was fundamentally Chinese\\". Return to China Ji left Harvard in the middle of his studies and returned to the newly formed People's Republic of China. He studied chemistry at Tsinghua University in Beijing, with the goal of being a scientist and developing nuclear weapons for the PRC. He was instead selected to be an interpreter and notetaker at the negotiations in Panmunjom that would eventually bring an end to the Korean War, due to his English-language skills. After two years in Korea, he returned to Beijing where he was recruited to become Zhou's English interpreter, accompanying the Premier to the 1954 Geneva Conference, and on Zhou's many other international trips. For most of the next two decades, he was a close aide to Zhou, and a frequent interpreter for Mao, often appearing on Mao's right on the reviewing stand at Tiananmen Square during public celebrations when English-speaking dignitaries were present. He holds the distinction of having been interpreter for Mao Zedong's last two official visits with English-speaking dignitaries, in 1976, months before the chairman's death. Role in Sino-American relations During his long career, Ji's first-hand knowledge of American culture made him a valuable member of the Chinese diplomatic corps. This was especially showcased during Henry Kissinger's secret visit to Beijing in 1971, which led to President Nixon's visit to China the following year. Zhou Enlai chose Ji to head the first diplomatic mission to the U.S. in 1973. Ji went on to establish the PRC's first liaison office in Washington, and was subsequently assigned to its embassy staff in the US after full diplomatic relations were established. He served as interpreter for Deng Xiaoping during his visit to the US in 1979. The New York Times observed how – from the time of Nixon's visit to China until Deng's visit to the US – Ji was the only person from either country capable of interpreting from English to Chinese. The newspaper consequently labelled him \\"The Indispensable Mr. Chi\\". He was highly respected by US officials, so much so that in 1981, then- Secretary of State Alexander Haig specifically asked the PRC to send Ji to meet with Ronald Reagan in an attempt to defuse tensions between the two sides. This arose as a result of president's plans to sell sophisticated weapons to Taiwan. Ji met with every American president from Nixon to Clinton. Family and political life In 1956, Ji married Wang Xiangtong, an English translator working for the International Red Cross. Both Ji and Wang experienced periodic political problems during the many purges and other upheavals that marked the Mao years. In spite of his close association with Zhou and Mao, Ji was considered suspect because he had been educated in the U.S., and an elder brother had stayed behind when Ji returned to China. Wang had a similar problem, as her father and mother had become separated at the end of the civil war when the Communists took control and the Nationalists fled to Taiwan. Her father and three brothers were stranded and could not return to the mainland, and her mother was in Beijing and could not leave. Ji was able to join the Chinese Communist Party in spite of his overseas connections, but Wang could not. They had two sons: Xiaotan lives in Beijing with his wife and a daughter, and Xiao-bin lives in the U.S., where he had attended high school and college while Ji was working in China's Washington embassy, and Wang was working at the United Nations. In his final years, Ji divided his time between Beijing and the island of Hainan. Death Ji Chaozhu died on April 29, 2020, at the age of 90 from an undisclosed illness. News of his death was first announced by the China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a brief notice to the Associated Press. Ambassadorial appointments From 1985 to 1987, Ji was Chinese Ambassador to Fiji with concurrent nonresident Diplomatic accreditation as Chinese Ambassador to Kiribati and Chinese Ambassador to Vanuatu. From 1987 to 1991 he was Ambassador to the Court of St James (United Kingdom). References Further reading * \\"Chaozhu Ji. The Man on Mao’s Right,\\" H-Diplo Roundtable Reviews. X.22 (2009).

It allows for higher capacity on the metro as more passengers a transported via the Ring Line instead of through the congested Common Tunnel. Construction started in June 2013 and the line opened on 3 April 2016. Route The Løren Line is a long section of Oslo Metro between Sinsen and Økern, connecting the Ring Line with the Grorud Line. It consists of one intermediate station, Løren. The line runs entirely in a tunnel, consisting of of tunnel through bedrock and in a concrete culvert. The line runs north a mostly parallel to the mainline Alna Line. In the west the line branches off the Ring Line in a tunnel section south of Sinsen. Each track of the Løren Line forks off in a separate tunnel and then head east while the Ring Line turns southwest. The line runs in two tubes to Løren Station, after which they merge into a single tube. The station is situated below the surface in the redevelopment area of Lørenbyen. The station has an area of and has an entrance from each end. The line then makes a U-turn and branches into the Grorud Line between the stations of Hasle and Økern. Service The line receives a service which runs along the Grorud Line, cuts along the Løren Line and then runs through the Ring Line. The trains run every fifteen minutes—half the departures along the Grorud Line. The Løren Line allows for ten minutes saved for riders heading from the Grorud Line to stations on the Ring Line, and allows the same travel time to Majorstuen. Løren Station is estimated to receive six thousand daily passengers, making it among the ten busiest on the metro network. The changes will reduce the number of services from the Grorud Line to the Common Tunnel. The increased capacity will allow the Østensjø Line to double the number of services. History The Grorud Line was built as part of the original metro network and opened on 16 November 1966. The Ring Line was built in two stages between 2000 and 2006. Oslo Sporveier announced in 2005 that it planned to double the number of services on the Grorud Line, to eight per hour. However, the bottleneck of the system is the Common Tunnel through the city center and services on all branches of the metro are limited by the capacity of that line. With the Ring Line under way, planners started to look at how it could be used to increase traffic flow and capacity of the metro. This would allow traffic to be diverted around the Ring Line instead of through the Common Tunnel, increasing capacity on the system as a whole. A 2006 schematic which shows the operating principle of the metro with the Løren Line. Since the Holmenkollen Line and the Kolsås Line have both been added to the operating concept. Five alternatives were proposed in 2007, which considered various ways to connect the Grorud Line and the Ring Line. Variations included building part of the line with single track and whether or not to construct a station at Løren. The latter would increase the price, but would give the area a significantly better transit service. As of 2007 the area was only served by a bus every twenty minutes. Funding of the Løren Line was secured as part of Oslo Package 3. During planning the line was variously known as the Løren Curve () and the Hastle Curve (). An alternative or supplemental proposals has been to use the Alna Line as a cross-town services of the Oslo Commuter Rail. Both the Norwegian National Rail Administration and Ruter have investigated the possibility to run services from the Trunk Line across the Alna Line and up the Gjøvik Line, but have found a too low traffic potential to carry out the proposal. The Løren Line is being built at the same time as the Løren, Hasle and Økern area is undergoing a major redevelopment. While the area previously has had some residential areas and has mostly been dominated by industry, it has now been designated a primary site for urban development in Oslo. The area has a potential for 25,000 residences and 2.5 million square meters (25 million sq ft) of commercial area. Oslo Municipal Council approved in May 2013 the construction of 730 apartments in the immediate vicinity of the station. Planning of the Løren Line is part of a wider concept of building additional rail-based services across Groruddalen. There are three lines, two metro lines and the mainline Trunk Line, which run down the valley, but there is no good system for crossing the valley. This is in part caused by both railways and motorways creating barriers. The municipal authorities are therefore looking at future connections between the metro's Grorud Line and the Furuset Line, with a possible transfer station with the Trunk Line. The zoning plan allow the line was passed on 14 December 2011. The contract for the ground work of the line was awarded by Sporveien to Skanska on 13 May 2013 and had a value of 357 million Norwegian krone and construction commenced in June. The project also included upgrade of the stations Rommen, Romsås and Vestli on the Grorud Line. The lower parts of the Grorud Line was closed from September through December to allow construction work on the connection. The Ring Line from Sinsen to Carl Berners plass is similarly proposed closed from June 2014 to March 2015. Construction is scheduled for completion in October 2015 and to be opened in early 2016. Construction was carried out with two crossections, from Anders Winsvoldsvei and Båhusveien at Bilia. In addition, Løres Station was built with the cut-and-cover method, doubling as a crossection. The line opened on 3 April 2016.

Life  Before the war he worked for the cinema (with René Clair and his brother Henri), as a radio journalist and producer on Le Poste Parisien (with Jean Nohain, meeting Georges Feydeau, Edmond Rostand, Henri Bergson, Georges Courteline, Tristan Bernard or Sacha Guitry), and as an editor with François Bernouard (editing Jules Renard, Courteline, Zola). In 1940, he left Paris and spent two years in the Midi, establishing the first Résistance networks and links with the British. On 31 August 1942, he left from Cannes for Gibraltar at night on the sail-boat Seadog, then went by plane to London, with Nicholas Bodington. From 17 May 1943 to 24 September 1944, he was the daily presenter of Honneur et patrie, the programme for the French resistance, creating le Chant des partisans and announcing every day \\"Ici Londres, les Français parlent aux Français\\" (\\"This is London, the French talk to the French\\"). On 1 June 1944, he replaced Maurice Schumann as general de Gaulle's spokesman. After the war, he dedicated himself to writing plays and novels, as well as television and radio scripts. In the 1950s he, Emmanuel Berl and Maurice Clavel presented the radio series Qui êtes-vous ?. In 1954, Gillois created one of the first French TV gameshows, Télé Match, with Jacques Antoine and Pierre Bellemare, and in 1958 a jury (including Georges Simenon) awarded him the prix du Quai des Orfèvres for his crime novel 125, rue Montmartre. In 1973, André-Gillois he published La Vie secrète des Français à Londres de 1940 à 1944, and in 1980 his memoirs were published as Ce siècle avait deux ans.

As a war artist, Kennington specialised in depictions of the daily hardships endured by soldiers and airmen. In the inter-war years he worked mostly on portraits and a number of book illustrations. The most notable of his book illustrations were for T. E. Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Kennington was also a gifted sculptor, best known for his 24th East Surrey Division War Memorial in Battersea Park, for his work on the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon and for the tomb effigy of Lawrence at Wareham in Dorset. Biography =Early life= Kennington was born in Chelsea, London, the second son of the genre and portrait painter, Thomas Benjamin Kennington (1856–1916), a founder member of the New English Art Club. He was educated at St Paul's School and the Lambeth School of Art. Kennington first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1908. At the International Society in April 1914 Kennington exhibited a series of paintings and drawings of costermongers which sold well and allowed him to set up a studio off Kensington High Street in London.. =First World War= The Kensingtons at Laventie (1915) (Art.IWM ART 15661) The Conquerors; originally titled The Victims it was renamed after objections from Lieutenant-Colonel Cyrus Wesley Peck, the commanding officer of 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish), CEF At the start of World War I, Kennington enlisted with the 13th (Kensington) Battalion London Regiment on 6 August 1914.'The Kensingtons at Levantie', 'Kensington Express' 16 June 1916, P.4 He fought on the Western Front, but was wounded in January 1915 and evacuated back to England. Kennington was injured while attempting to clear a friend's jammed rifle and he lost one toe and was fortunate not to lose a foot due to infection. He spent four months in hospital before being discharged as unfit in June 1915. During his convalescence, he spent six months painting The Kensingtons at Laventie, a group portrait of his own infantry platoon, Platoon No 7, 'C' Company. Kennington himself is the figure third from the left, wearing a balaclava. When exhibited in the spring of 1916, its portrayal of exhausted soldiers caused a sensation. Painted in reverse on glass, the painting is now in the Imperial War Museum and was widely praised for its technical virtuosity, iconic colour scheme, and its \\"stately presentation of human endurance, of the quiet heroism of the rank and file\\". Kennington visited the Somme in December 1916 as a semi-official artist visitor before, back in London, producing six lithographs under the title Making Soldiers for the Ministry of Information's Britain's Efforts and Ideals portfolio of images which were exhibited in Britain and abroad and were also sold as prints to raise money for the war effort. In May 1917 he accepted an official war artist commission from the Department of Information. Kennington was commissioned to spend a month on the Western Front but he applied for numerous extensions and eventually spent seven and a half months in France. Kennington was originally based at the Third Army Headquarters and would spend time at the front lines near Villers-Faucon. Later during this tour, his friend William Rothenstein was also appointed as a war artist and they worked together at Montigny Farm and at Devise on the Somme, where they often came under shell-fire. Kennington spent most of his time painting portraits, which he was happy to do, but became increasingly concerned about his lack of access to the front line and that the official censor was removing the names of his portrait subjects. Although Kennington was among the first of the official war artists Britain sent to France, he was not afforded anything like the status and facilities that the others, in particular William Orpen and Muirhead Bone enjoyed. Whereas Kennington was working for neither salary nor expenses and had no official car or staff, Orpen was given the rank of major, had his own military aide, a car and driver, plus, at his own expense, a batman and assistant to accompany him. Kennington could be aggressive and irritable and at times complained bitterly about his situation, claiming he must have been the cheapest artist employed by the Government and that \\"Bone had a commission and Orpen had a damned good time\\". During his time in France, Kennington produced 170 charcoal, pastel and watercolours before returning to London in March 1918. Whilst in France in 1918, Kennington was admitted to a Casualty Clearing Station at Tincourt-Boucly to be treated for trench fever. There he made a number of sketches and drawings of men injured during the bombardment that preceded the German 1918 Spring Offensive. Some of these drawings became the basis of the completed painting Gassed and Wounded. Throughout June and July 1918 an exhibition of Kennington's work, \\"The British Soldier\\", was held in London and received great reviews and some public acclaim. Despite this, Kennington was unhappy in his dealings with Department of Information, mainly concerning the censoring of his paintings, and he resigned his war artist commission with the British. In November 1918 Kennington was commissioned by the Canadian War Memorials Scheme to depict Canadian troops in Europe. That month he returned to France as a temporary first lieutenant attached to the 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish), CEF. The eight months Kennington spent in Germany, Belgium and France, working for the Canadians, resulted in some seventy drawings. =1920s= 24th East Surrey Division War Memorial, Battersea Park At an exhibition of his war art in London, Kennington met T. E. Lawrence who became a great influence on him. Kennington spent the first half of 1921 travelling through Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine drawing portraits of Arab subjects. These were displayed at an exhibition in October 1921 and some of the drawings were used as illustrations for Lawrence's The Seven Pillars of Wisdom, for which Kennington worked as the art editor. Years later, in 1935, Kennington was to serve as one of the six pallbearers at Lawrence's funeral. In 1922 Kennington began to experiment with stone carving and soon undertook his first public commission, the War Memorial to the 24th Division in Battersea Park which was unveiled in October 1924. The same month he held his first exhibition which focused on sculpture rather than his paintings and drawings, although he continued to accept portrait commissions and other work. These included the original dust jacket design for George Bernard Shaw's book The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism. During the 1920s, Kennington worked on a frieze for the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine intended to be situated above the School's Keppel Street entrance. The stone panel depicts a mother and child being protected from a fanged serpent by a nude, bearded, knife-wielding father. However, due to the prominent display of male genitalia, the trustees of the School would not allow it to be placed above the School's entrance unless Kennington added a well placed loin cloth. He refused and the work was placed above the entrance of the library where it remains. In 1966, when the library's mezzanine floor was constructed, a large crack formed and was subsequently painted to disguise the damage. In 1922, Kennington married Edith Cecil, daughter of Lord Francis Horace Pierrepont Cecil (who was second son of William Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Exeter), with whom he had a son and a daughter. Edith, who was already married to William Hanbury-Tracy (5th Baron Sudeley), fell in love with Kennington while he was painting her husband's picture. They both remained good friends with Edith's ex-husband. =1930s= The Kennington Frieze, above the entrance of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine's library. Comet hotel, Hatfield Throughout the late 1920s and the 1930s, Kennington produced a number of notable public sculptures, *September 1926; a bronze bust of T. E. Lawrence which in 1936 was unveiled in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral *July 1929; three nine foot high stone figures of British soldiers for the Imperial War Graves Commission Memorial to the Missing, the Soissons Memorial *1931; statue of Thomas Hardy which was unveiled in Dorchester by J.

E. Lawrence for St Martin's Church, Wareham, Dorset. =Second World War= Parachutes (1941), Art.IWM ART LD1259 By November 1938 Kennington was certain that another World War was inevitable and he approached the Home Office with a proposal to establish a group to design camouflage schemes for large public buildings. Alongside Richard Carline, Leon Underwood and others he worked in a section attached to the Air Raid Precautions Department of the Home Office until war broke out. At the start of the Second World War, Kennington produced a number of pastel portraits of Royal Navy officers for the War Artists' Advisory Committee (WAAC), on short-term contracts. These portraits were among the highlights of the first WAAC exhibition at the National Gallery in the summer of 1940. Kennington also painted a portrait of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Dudley Pound. Pound was seriously ill when Kennington sketched him and although the Admiralty were pleased with the image they refused permission for it to be displayed until after Pound died in October 1943. Kennington next painted several younger seamen, several of whom had survived shipwrecks. By May 1940 Kennington was frustrated by WAAC's lack of urgency in putting forward subjects for him to paint and resigned his contract. He joined the newly formed Home Guard and was given command of a six-man section at Ipsden. In August 1940 the WAAC Committee offered him a full-time salaried contract to work for the Air Ministry, which he accepted. Among Kennington's first RAF portraits was one of Squadron Leader Roderick Learoyd VC. The sitting took place on the afternoon of 7 September 1940 at the Air Ministry building in London and was interrupted by an air-raid siren which, after Learoyd had looked outside to see where the German planes were heading, the two men ignored. By March 1941 Kennington was based at RAF Wittering, a Night Fighter base. Here, as well as portraits Kennington produced some more imaginative works, including In the Flare Path and Stevens' Rocket. Kennington next spent some time at Bomber Command bases in Norfolk before moving to RAF Ringway near Manchester where the Parachute Regiment were training. Although over-age, Kennington undertook at least one parachute jump at Ringwood. In September 1941 he self-published an illustrated booklet, Pilots, Workers, Machines to great acclaim. Kennington continued to travel around Britain to produce hundreds of portraits of Allied flight crew and other service personnel until September 1942 when he resigned his commission because he felt that WAAC were failing to capitalise on the propaganda value of his work in their publications and posters. Some 52 of Kennington's RAF portraits were published in a 1942 WAAC book, Drawing the RAF. This was followed in 1943 with Tanks and Tank Folk, illustrations from Kennington's time with the 11th Armoured Division near Ripon in Yorkshire. In 1945 Kennington supplied the illustrations for Britain's Home Guard by John Brophy. Darracott and Loftus describe how in both wars \\"his drawings and letters show him to be an admirer of the heroism of ordinary men and women\\", an admiration which is particularly notable in the poster series \\"Seeing it Through\\", with poems by A. P. Herbert, a personal friend of his. =Post-war career= By the time the war ended over forty of the RAF pilots and aircrew whose portraits Kennington had painted had been killed in action. Kennington resolved to create a suitable memorial for them and over the next ten years, whilst also working on sculpture and portrait commissions, he patiently carved 1940, a column with the head of an RAF pilot topped by the Archangel Michael with a lance slaying a dragon. In 1946 Kennington was appointed as the official portrait painter to the Worshipful Company of Skinners. Over the next five years he produced nine pastel portraits for the company, which were highly praised when shown at the Royal Academy. In 1951 Kennington became an associate member of the Academy and was elected a full academician in 1959. His last work, which was completed on his death by his assistant Eric Stanford, was a stone relief panel that decorates the James Watt South Building in the University of Glasgow. Kennington is buried in the churchyard in Checkendon, Oxfordshire, where he was churchwarden, and is commemorated on a memorial in Brompton Cemetery, London.

It is the sequel to Nightmare Creatures. Plot In 1934, Adam Crowley, an occultist and antagonist from the previous game, has created a vast race of mutant creatures, which he is using to wipe out a group of monster hunters called the Circle. Meanwhile, Herbert Wallace, a patient at Crowley's genetics hospital, escapes from captivity, armed with an axe. He arrives in London, where he discovers evidence of a picture of Ignatius Blackward, who in the previous game with Nadia Franciscus had defeated Crowley. In a fire, Wallace is rescued from it by Rachel, the only surviving member of the Circle. They head their separate ways, with Wallace venturing to Crowley's castle, only to discover that Crowley himself is not there, but he is in Paris. He then falls down a chute, which leads to a biplane that he flies to France. Wallace enters a cinema, where he finds a note from Rachel informing him that she knows of Crowley's plans. He then proceeds onwards to a museum to meet up with Rachel, but unknown to Wallace, Rachel is captured by zombies. Wallace then enters the museum, where he finds a detailed blueprint of the Eiffel Tower, along with some of Crowley's plans. In a crypt which Wallace enters, he is attacked by zombies, escapes in a car, and crashes in an elaborate graveyard after getting assaulted by a zombie that hid in the back, where he finds a part of Rachel's shirt snagged on a tree. Wallace departs from the graveyard, and falls into a sewer, which in turn takes him to the Paris underground, where he finds evidence of documents of ancient cults, and leads to the Eiffel Tower. He then climbs to the top of the structure, where he finds a grotesque monstrosity. Using dynamite, he explodes the creature, only for the explosion to throw him off the top of the spire. However, his fall is cushioned, and he is reunited with Rachel, whereupon they walk away together. Whether Crowley is plotting his next scheme or gone forever is completely unknown. Gameplay The gameplay is similar to the previous installment, seeing the adrenaline bar abandoned and the addition of fatality moves to execute weakened enemies. Music The game features licensed music from Rob Zombie in the cutscenes while the in-game music was composed by the Nightmare Creatures composer, Frédéric Motte. Reception Greg Orlando reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Konami's 'dream' turns out to be nothing 'but clouds in our coffee.' (We sincerely apologize to Carly Simon.)\\" The PlayStation version of Nightmare Creatures II received \\"mixed\\" reviews, while the Dreamcast version received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.

During the Second World War he founded and headed the CARTE network, also taking \\"Carte\\" as his personal codename. Life =Prewar= He was the eldest child born to a pair of brewers, and attended the École des Beaux-Arts before doing military service at Saint-Cyr. He became a painter, studying with both Roualt and Bonnard, as well as a caricaturist, and theatre set designer, and as one of the best known publicity poster designers in Paris during the 1930s. He set himself up in Venice in 1936–37 and in Manhattan in 1938. =1939–45= Having married Andrée Jouan (known as \\"la petite Andrée\\") and had 4 children (all daughters, including Danièle Delorme) before war broke out, he was not called up in 1939. He refused to see the Germans enter Paris after their success in the Battle of France, and departed in 1940 for the free zone of France, setting up at Antibes. There he painted his four daughters and founded the CARTE network. He was apolitical and tended towards recruitment and spying ready for an armed uprising against the Germans. At first hostile to Gaullism, he aroused the interest of the Special Operations Executive, who carried out a favourable evaluation of him and his network and then supplied him with arms, radio operators and money. In July 1942 Nicholas Bodington, second in command of SOE's F section, landed in France to check on the value of reports about CARTE transmitted by agent Francis Basin, but on 12 September that year Bodington filed a report confirming SOE's highly favourable opinion of the network. However, security indiscretions and differences between Girard and his second in command Henri Frager weakened the network. For example, in November 1942 a suitcase containing a list of 200 CARTE members disappeared, either lost by André Marsac when he fell asleep on a train and finally falling into Abwehr hands, or being lost by Marsac in Marseille and coming into the hands of Dubois, police commissioner and head of security for CARTE, who then let the interested parties know of its loss via Bartroli de Mandres. Whichever account is true, no arrests resulted from the loss in the end, but CARTE was fatally weakened and the SOE network Prosper - PHYSICIAN largely took over its work (particularly using its important intelligence files). In 1943 Girard refused to merge CARTE with COMBAT, feeling it to be too close to Gaullism, and on the night of 20/21 February that year flew to England on SOE orders, having been picked up by a Lockheed A-28 Hudson near Arles. SOE opposed his returning to France, even when he learned of his wife's arrest and deportation to Ravensbrück concentration camp (she was only released in 1945). He thus broke with SOE and went into self-imposed exile in the United States of America, where he remained until his death. There he gave conferences and wrote articles and books to vent his opposition to both the British and the Gaullists, thus pushing himself into relative obscurity. =Post-war= In New York, he produced several religious paintings (Stations of the Cross, Apocalypse, etc.) and in 1952 he decorated several churches in New York, Vermont and California. In 1947 he published Peut-on dire la vérité sur la Résistance, in which he presented several important corrections to Bénouville's book Le Sacrifice du matin. He died and was buried in America in 1968.

It is firmly rooted in old Balinese Hinduism and philosophies of Indonesia. The name means \\"national devotion\\", from the Sanskrit words bhakti (devotion) and nagara (country). It is the most widely practiced martial art in Bali and the most well-known style of Balinese silat, to the point that the system is commonly referred to simply as pencak Bali or kuntao Bali. Some movements are similar to Balinese dances and performing arts like the Barong dance. Although the system is very much self-defence oriented, its practitioners also participate in modern competitions and have achieved some important victories in many regional, national and international tournaments. Philosophy Bakti Negara is a self- defense system to train cipta (thought), rasa (sense), and karsa (will), to develop complete a human being according to Balinese philosophy of Tri Hita Karana. Skill should not be used as the tool of aggression, but as a way to develop and cultivate oneself. The school teaches four elements: #Sport, developing the physical ability to practice the techniques through exercises for the benefit of maintaining physical health and athletic achievement. #Martial, developing fighting ability. #Art, practising to the point where fighting techniques are aesthetic as well as effective #Mental and spirituality, aims to strengthen the ability to control oneself. History Bakti Negara was officially created on 31 January 1955 in Banjar Kaliungu Kaja of Denpasar, Bali by four freedom-fighters who were veterans in Indonesia's struggle for independence from the Dutch. They were Anak Agung Rai Tokir, I Bagus Made Rai Keplag, Anak Agung Meranggi and Sri Empu Dwi Tantra. Each was a master in one of Bali's native schools, and incorporated these techniques into the new system. Because of this, Bakti Negara was still considered a traditional Balinese art because all of its movements were taken from pre- existing disciplines indigenous to the island. The task of leading and managing Bakti Negara was given to Ida Bagus Oka Dewangkara. After 1968 Bakti Negara underwent a period of further development during the transition from the older to the new generation. The Lembaga Dewan Pendekar Bakti Negara gave I Bagus Alit Dira the mandate to systemise the teaching structure of Bakti Negara with the help of other instructors. While the school prided itself on combat effectiveness over sport, it was felt that some form of competition was necessary to test students. A point-based sparring system was introduced, and a coloured belt system of ranking was adopted from Japan. Championships were held every three years, always tied with some Balinese ceremony. As other Balinese silat schools chose to remain independent of politics, Bakti Negara vied for status from the education ministry with Perisai Diri, seen as a foreign style. Through a process of standardization and acculturation, Bakti Negara became an integral part of Banjar or village social organisation (seka), and entered the Balinese school system. Today it is practiced in almost every town and village in Bali. Training The basis of Bakti Negara is tipuan or deception. If a fight is unavoidable, the exponent taunts and provokes the opponent into losing their mental poise. As with most Balinese silat, this characteristic is displayed in the art's deceptive stances and movements. By feigning weakness or acting inattentive, a Bakti Negara practitioner lures the enemy into a blind attack before launching their own counterattack. Fighting in such an indirect manner requires stamina, so Bakti Negara students use flexibility and endurance training to ensure they do not tire themselves out easily. This is the reason why, compared to other Balinese silat, Bakti Negara is said to be most suited to those with a small frame. Through practice, the fighter also learns to judge whether a ruse is worth the energy or has a low chance of success. In Bakti Negara, the opponent's body is seen as a rectangular section and attacks are concentrated along a line with their shoulders. Another common target is the opponent's front leg or foot. If an enemy charges forward, the Bakti Negara exponent would use the ground- sitting sempok or depok stance and kick or sweep the advancing leg. Blocking and parrying is always done with the open hands. If the attacking limb is grabbed, the grabbing hand would be countered with a slap. The tricky nature of Bakti Negara favours a range of about two yards from the opponent. Grappling and infighting is limited, consisting mainly of joint locks on the elbows and shoulders, but these techniques were never developed as highly on Bali as in other parts of Indonesia. Rather, striking is preferred, particularly punches and kicks. The most common weapons in Bakti Negara are the toya (staff), chabang (forked truncheon), and pisau (knife). The chabang's significance as a Hindu symbol is reflected in its importance to Bakti Negara. Other weapons include the toyak (halberd), tombak jago (longspear), and penchong (club). In its attempt to modernize, Bakti Negara uses a coloured belt system to signify rank, adopted from Japanese fighting arts. The belt colours in ascending order are red, blue, brown, yellow, and purple. The purple belt is reserved for master teachers. Sparring is also typical of modern combat sports. Points are awarded for clean hits, while strikes to vital points are forbidden.

It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2006. History The Ariston Café in Litchfield was built in 1935 for original owners Pete Adam and Tom Cokinos, two experienced restaurateurs. Pete Adam had operated an Ariston Café in Carlinville since 1924; after 1930 a highway realignment moved U.S. Route 66 in Illinois further east. Work began on April 4, 1935, by hired contractor Henry A. Vasel and the building was completed on July 5, 1935. Design The design of the Ariston Café does not reflect any particular architectural style. Instead, it was built in a utilitarian style, common for small commercial buildings of its time. Despite being non-stylistic, the building does contain echoes of the popular Art Deco style of the time period in its interior booths. On its exterior the Ariston's most distinguishing features are the curved parapet wall on the front façade and its fine and varied brick work. Originally, the Ariston, like many Route 66 businesses, had two fuel pumps fronting it. Historic significance The Ariston Café is the longest-operating restaurant along the entire stretch of U.S. Route 66., via Route 66 University It is representative of the types of businesses that once met with great success along historic Route 66. Despite a few alterations, including the addition of a banquet room, the building still maintains a historic character from the era of its construction. The Ariston Café was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 5, 2006.

Manggarai people are spread across three districts in the province, namely the West Manggarai Regency, Manggarai Regency and East Manggarai Regency. Etymology The Manggarai people sometimes refer to themselves as Ata Manggarai, which means \\"people of Manggarai\\". Settlements Manggarai people are one of the aboriginal population of the island of Flores. Manggarai settlements cover over 6,700 square kilometers, almost a third of Flores, in the western part of the island. History According to historical records, they have been occupied alternately by other tribes such as the Bima people from the island of Sumbawa and the Makassar people from Sulawesi island, Indonesia. As of the late 20th century, there are about 500,000 Manggarai people. Early state formations of the Manggarai in the 17th century had their first king of Minangkabau descent from the Sultanate of Gowa, Makassar; which led to the spread of Islam on the island of Flores most likely through trading sea-route. In 1727, the Manggarai region was given to the Bima Sultanate as a dowry when a Makassarese princes was married into the Bima royalty. In 1929, the Western part of Flores was separated from the Bima Sultanate. Then, followed by the invasion of the Dutch colonialists in the 20th century and the subsequent Christianization of Manggarai. Language The language spoken throughout the region is called Tombo Manggarai, a language with around 43 sub-dialects divided into 5 dialect groups which is very distinct from the languages of ethnic groups to the east and from Indonesian.Ethnologue: Manggarai The 5 dialect groups are Western Manggarai, Central West Manggarai, Central Manggarai, East Manggarai and Far East Manggarai. The latter, separated from other dialects by the Rembong language, is distributed in the north-central part of the island of Flores. It is spoken by about 300,000 people. There are also native speakers of the Rongga language (there are about 5,000 of them) living in three settlements in the southern part of the East Manggarai Regency. This language is not singled out even by most of Manggarai people themselves, because it is considered as part of the Manggarai language. Culture Manggarai womenfolk. =Religion= More than 90% of the Manggarai people are Catholics; the eastern Manggarai in the region of Borong are Catholics. Some living in the west profess Sunnism (their number is approximately 33,898 people). and the population of the central part of the island adheres to traditional beliefs. Traditional beliefs of settlements in the central part of the island include the cult of the supreme creator god, Mori Karaeng, a form of ancestral worship. Massive celebrations are held by the priest to sacrifice buffalos (), which are accompanied by ritual dances and battles between the two parties of men in military garb. =Rituals= The Manggarai people are known to have series of ritual as a thanksgiving for the life that has been given to them to live in a certain time period. Among others are:- * Penti Manggarai, a ceremony of harvest thanksgiving celebration. * Barong Lodok, a ritual that invites the guardian spirit to the center of Lingko (middle farm). * Barong Wae, a ritual to invite ancestral spirits to be a watcher over springs. * Barong Compang, a ceremony of summoning a village guardian spirit at night. * Wisi Loce, this ceremony is conducted so that all spirits who are invited are able to wait a moment before the climax of the Penti ceremony. * Libur Kilo, a ceremony of thanksgiving for the welfare of each family in their homes. =Traditional clothing= Initially, the traditional clothing consist of two pieces of fabric, reinforced in front and behind with a cord at the waist and hips. Modern clothing are of the same type as mainstream Indonesian. =Fighting arts= A Caci warrior and his whip, Ruteng, Flores, Indonesia, 2007. Manggarai people also have a traditional folk sport and war dance called , a form of whip fighting where fighting and parrying each other using a whip and a shield is usually performed by two young men in a large field. performance usually begins with dance performances, before the warriors display their abilities to hit and parry in the competition. The dance is commonly referred to as Tandak Manggarai, a dance performed on stage to predict the outcome of the competition. Society and lifestyle The early state formations of the Manggarai are subdivided into 39 chiefdoms, called , which in turn split into smaller administrative units that are known as and ( corresponds to the traditional rural community). At the head of the is controlled by one of the localized patriarchate clan (), that ascended from the first settlers. Family relationships are based on the patrilineal line. The Manggarai people recognizes several types of marriages such as matrilateral cross-cousin marriage, Levirate marriage, Sororate marriage, a marriage between the offspring of two sisters that marries the sons of two brothers, and so on. Most monogamous family are formed by Christians, and small groups among Muslims and adherents of traditional beliefs allows Polygyny. The Manggarai people to this day are divided into three social groups namely, aristocrats (), community members () and descendants of slaves. The traditional settlement has a circular layout, and the modern () is an ordinary one. In the center of the settlement is a round public space on which is a large tree; usually of the Ficus genus and megalithic structures are found. In the past, a settlement could consist of one large house, which could hold up to 200 people. In modern settlements, usually has from 5 to 20 homes of round or oval shape on stilts, with a high (about 9 meters) conical roof descending to the ground. In Manggarai settlements, free spaces are paved with huge stones. In the city of Ende, the dead are buried in round holes, which are closed by stones placed on the grave. =Politics= Their political system is clan-based, led by a chief clan called Todo. This people practices patrilineal descent system, and historically they live in villages of which consists at least two clans. =Livelihood= Distribution of handicrafts are such as carving, metalworking and weaving. They also engage in manual tropical farming (they switched from slash-and-burn system to Crop rotation system to grow Upland rice, legumes, vegetables, tobacco, coffee and corn). Animal husbandry is widespread (buffaloes are bred for socially significant animal ceremonies, horses are kept as packs transportation, pigs and chickens). Manggarai people do not hunt nor do they fish. =Dietary= The main food is corn porridge with vegetables and pork (which are only consumed by non-Muslim Manggarai people), as well as palm wine ().

Career Aalbers' goal was to bring Vitesse from the bottom of the second tier, where the club was when he started, to the top 40 soccer clubs of Europe. Aalbers developed the basic idea for the 'Gelredome', a stadium with a sliding pitch that can be moved out of the building. Later, the same system was applied in Gelsenkirchen (Schalke 04) and in Japan. Events such as pop concerts can be held without damaging the grass. Gelredome opened in 1998. It has a roof that can be opened and closed and is fully climate controlled. In the first season after the opening, Vitesse's attendance rose to 20,000, from less than 8,000 in the old stadium. Aalbers financed the ambitions by making solid profits on the transfer market. Players such as Roy Makaay, Sander Westerveld, Nikos Machlas, Glenn Helder and Philip Cocu were sold for large sums of money. Others came to occupy empty player positions, such as Mahamadou Diarra and Pierre van Hooijdonk. Vitesse ranked in the top 4 positions, made a profit and showed a solid balance sheet in the final years of his presidency. Aalbers resigned on 15 February 2000, after the main sponsor, Nuon, threatened to pull the plug if he did not. Nuon, a public utility company owned by local authorities, had trouble explaining why it invested heavily in Aalbers' ambitious plans. The successor was Jan Koning, the former chief of Sara Lee's Douwe Egberts. In a short period of time, Vitesse began to show negative financial results, due to poor deals on the transfer market. The club survived numerous financial crises, such as the last one in 2008, when debts were bought of, under the threat of bankruptcy. Aalbers is currently a marketing expert and consultant in city and stadium development. He acts as a matchmaker in international projects. Aalbers and his wife live in Eerbeek.

The G3/L became one of the most popular motorcycles used during the war, as it was the first to replace the unforgiving \\"girder\\" front forks with a new technology, \\"Teledraulic\\" suspension. The Ministry of Defence continued to use the bikes into the 1960s. Development Pre war Marchless G3 from which the G3/L was developed In 1940 the British War Office requisitioned every available Matchless motorcycle to replace those lost at Dunkirk. Developed from the pre-war G3, the 'L' in the G3/L stood for \\"lightweight\\" in response to the War Office requirement for a motorcycle more suited to off- road use, as the designers managed to reduce the dry weight of the prototype by (although the later models were not so lightweight due to the additional army equipment that needed to be added). The real innovation of the G3/L was the \\"Teledraulic\\" forks, which were the first telescopic design with oil damping – an idea that was to become the standard for almost all future motorcycles. After exhaustive military testing the G3/L lost the War Office competition for a single standard 350 cc machine to Triumph's 350 cc side- valve vertical twin, the 3TW, which had a top speed of over 70 mph and weighed . Triumph's Priory Street works in Coventry were completely destroyed by German bombers in November 1940 All Triumph's technical records, drawings and designs were lost and Matchless won the contract. Triumph instead produced 350 cc sidevalves for the military during the war. Production of the G3/L began in late 1941, and a series of modifications and improvements were introduced as it entered military service. From 1942 the entire output of the Matchless factory was dedicated to the G3/L. Active service 1939 G3/L In 1940, 110 Matchless G3/L's were ordered from England by the South African Army as the preferred machine for use by despatch riders. As well as general army transport G3/L's were widely used for delivering messages that were too important to be sent by radio or by telephone. They were also used for convoy escort, having to read maps and act as an \\"advance party\\" into occupied territory. Dispatch riders were an easy target for snipers, had to use dimmed headlights and coped with poor road conditions. In a Second World War study, Sir Hugh Cairns identified head injuries as a major cause of loss of life among dispatch riders and recommended crash helmets instead of the standard \\"tin helmet\\" or forage caps that were often worn. Sir Hugh's recommendation eventually led to compulsory crash helmets for motorcyclists – but not for another 32 years. Post war Matchless G3LS (1955) at the National Motorcycle Museum (UK) A war-torn infrastructure and shortages made life problematic in places like Italy, but there were a few consolations for the Italian people to help themselves get back to normality. The Germans, British and Americans had all been in and out of Italy as invaders and liberators, and they had discarded or abandoned huge amounts of military hardware including tanks, trucks and motorcycles. Some of these motorcycles, such as the Matchless G3/L, were converted from military service to civilian service by Italian riders. Post-war G3/Ls were the military version finished in black instead of green or khaki. Despite its age, the Matchless was so well proven and reliable it remained in use by the Ministry of Defence for another 15 years after the end of the war, until replaced in 1960 by the BSA W-B40. The Matchless G3/L was a popular choice for UK trials riders, and after the war there were plenty of bikes and spares to enable champions such as Artie Ratcliffe and Ted Usher to win numerous national events for Matchless. The Royal Artillery Motor Cycle Display Team gave their first performance at the St Asaph Tattoo in July 1949 and used the G3/L for displays until they were replaced with the BSA Gold Star. The end was in sight, however, as the G3 was gaining weight without any corresponding increase in power. Suspension was upgraded to a swinging arm from 1949 and an aluminium cylinder head fitted from 1951. In 1955 the engine was uprated with stronger main bearings and an \\"auto-advance\\" fitted to the rotating magnet magneto, (now front-mounted for access). Front forks were also upgraded to improve handling and in 1958 an alternator was fitted and optional chrome tank panels, steering damper, brake light system and air filter were offered. The wartime G3/L today has an enthusiastic following on the classic bike scene and can cost up to £5,000 in original condition with the correct WD equipment.

Life =Pre-war= Girard worked for the Société d'exploitation industrielle des tabacs et des allumettes in France from 1929 onwards. =French Resistance= He was captured at the Battle of Dunkirk in 1940, but escaped from Germany in 1941 to Brive-la-Gaillarde and soon joined the French Resistance. Under the pseudonym \\"Pointer\\", Girard was the regional head of the Alliance or \\"Arche de Noé\\" resistance network in occupied France from 1940 to 1945, the only network whose supreme commander was a woman, Marie-Madeleine Fourcade (Alias \\"Hérisson\\"). This network was notable for giving almost all of its three thousand agents codenames based on animals : Bleu d'Auvergne, Setter, Labrador, Bichon, Abeille, Aigle... Divided up by region, the network's central command was \\"Hôpital\\" (centre-west sector), which Girard led from 1943 to September 1944. In 1944, his sector numbered 185 main agents across 16 départements, from south of the Loire to north of the Garonne, a sector particularly marked by the Tulle and Oradour-sur-Glane massacres. Its agents were from diverse social backgrounds – the mayor of La Rochelle and colonel in the reserve Léonce Vieljeux, the student Roland Creel, the vicar of Tulle cathedral Charles Lair, the usselois doctor Jean Sirieix, the intelligence commissioner Henry Castaing, the briviste businessman Pierre Bordes, the secretary-general to the council of Guéret Roland Deroubaix, the creusois lawyer René Nouguès or the electrician Vincent Renaud, as well as civil servants, peasants, surgeons, railway workers, architects, and ushers. On 30 June 1945, charged with a mission of the utmost importance for the Direction générale des études et recherches and promoted to captain, he was demobbed at his own request. Returning to his pre-war job, he was transferred to the tobacco factory at Riom before becoming administrative director and inspector of the tobacco factory at Lyon until his retirement. He also succeeded Jacques Soustelle on the municipal council of Lyon in 1962 under Louis Pradel. He was for several years the national treasurer of the Old Comrades association for the ALLIANCE network. He published his war memoirs in 1965 with éditions France-Empire under the title \\"Le temps de la méprise\\". He is buried in the cemetery at Saint-Sauves d'Auvergne.

C3a is one of the proteins formed by the cleavage of complement component 3; the other is C3b. C3a is a 77 residue anaphylatoxin that binds to the C3a receptor (C3aR), a class A G protein-coupled receptor. It plays a large role in the immune response. C3a molecules induce responses through the GPCR C3a receptor. Like other anaphylatoxins, C3a is regulated by cleavage of its carboxy-terminal arginine, which results in a molecule with lowered inflammatory function (C3a desarginine). C3a is an effector of the complement system with a range of functions including T cell activation and survival, angiogenesis stimulation, chemotaxis, mast cell degranulation, and macrophage activation. It has been shown to have both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, its activity able to counteract the proinflammatory effects of C5a.  Structure  = C3a = C3a is a strongly basic and highly cationic 77 residue protein with a molecular mass of approximately 10 kDa. Residues 17-66 are made up of three anti-parallel helices and three disulfide bonds, which confer stability to the protein. The N-terminus consists of a fourth flexible helical structure, while the C terminus is disordered. C3a has a regulatory process and a structure homologous to complement component C5a, with which it shares 36% of its sequence identity. = Receptor = C3a induces an immunological response through a 482 residue G-protein-coupled receptor called C3aR. The C3aR is similarly structurally homologous to C5aR, but contains an extracellular domain with more than 160 amino acids. Specific binding sites for interactions between C3a and C3aR are unknown, but it has been shown that sulfation of tyrosine 174, one of the amino acids in the extracellular domain, is required for C3a binding. It has also been demonstrated that the C3aR N terminus is not required for ligand binding.  Formation  C3a formation occurs through activation and cleavage of complement component 3 in a reaction catalyzed by C3-convertase. There are three pathways of activation, each of which leads to the formation of C3a and C3b, which is involved in antigen opsonization. Other than the alternative pathway, which is constantly active, C3a formation is triggered by pathogenic infection. = Classical pathway = The classical pathway of complement activation is initiated when the C1 complex, made up of C1r and C1s serine proteases, recognizes the Fc region of IgM or IgG antibodies bound to a pathogen. C1q mediates the classical pathway by activating the C1 complex, which cleaves C4 and C2 into smaller fragments (C4a, C4b, C2a, and C2b). C4a and C2b form C4bC2b, also known as C3 convertase. = Lectin pathway = The lectin pathway is activated when pattern-recognition receptors, like mannan-binding lectin or ficolins, recognize and bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns on the antigen, including sugars. These bound receptors then complex with Mannose-Binding Lectin-Associated Serine Proteases (MASPs), which have proteolytic activity similar to the C1 complex. The MASPs cleave C4 and C2, resulting in C3 convertase formation. = Alternative pathway = The alternative pathway of complement activation is typically always active at low levels in blood plasma through a process called tick-over, in which C3 spontaneously hydrolyzes into its active form, C3(H2O). This activation induces a conformational change in the thioester domain of C3(H2O) that allows it to bind to a plasma protein called Factor B. This complex is then cleaved by Factor D, a serine protease, to form C3b(H2O)Bb, or fluid-phase C3-convertase. This complex has the ability to catalyze the formation of C3a and C3b after it binds properdin, a globulin protein, and is stabilized.  Functions  Anaphylatoxins are small complement peptides that induce proinflammatory responses in tissues. C3a is primarily regarded for its role in the innate and adaptive immune responses as an anaphylatoxin, moderating and activating multiple inflammatory pathways. = Role in innate immunity = The roles of C3a in innate immunity, upon binding C3aR, include increased vasodilation via endothelial cell contraction, increased vascular permeability, and mast cell and basophil degranulation of histamine, induction of respiratory burst and subsequent degradation of pathogens by neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils, and regulation of cationic eosinophil protein migration, adhesion, and production. C3a is also able to play a role in chemotaxis for mast cells and eosinophils, but C5a is a more potent chemoattractant. Traditionally thought to serve a strictly pro- inflammatory role, recent investigations have shown that C3a can also work against C5a to serve an anti-inflammatory role. In addition, migration and degranulation of neutrophils can be suppressed in the presence of C3a. = Role in adaptive immunity = C3a also plays an important role in adaptive immunity, moderating leukocyte production and proliferation. C3a is able to regulate B cell and monocyte production of IL-6 and TNF-α, and human C3a has been shown to dampen the polyclonal immune response through dose-dependent regulation of B cell molecule production. C3aR signaling along antigen- presenting cells' CD28 and CD40L pathways also plays a role in T cell proliferation and differentiation. C3aR has been shown to be necessary for TH1 cell generation and regulates TH1 IL-10 expression, while an absence of active C3aR on dendritic cells upregulates regulatory T cell production. The absence of C3 has also been shown to decrease IL-2 receptor expression on T cells.  Regulation  = Regulation of complement activation = Levels of complement are regulated by moderating convertase formation and enzymatic activity. C3 convertase formation is primarily regulated by levels of active C3b and C4b. Factor I, a serine protease activated by cofactors, can cleave and C3b and C4b, thus preventing convertase formation. C3 convertase activity is also regulated without C3b inactivation, through complement control proteins, including decay-accelerating factors that function to speed up C3 convertase half-lives and avert convertase formation. = Deactivation = C3a, like other anaphylatoxins, has a C-terminal arginine residue. Serum carboxypeptidase B, a protease, cleaves the arginine residue from C3a, forming the desArg derivative of C3a, also known as acylation stimulating protein (ASP). Unlike C5a desArg, this version of C3a has no proinflammatory activity.

He played rugby league (RL) at representative level for Great Britain, and at club level for Wakefield Trinity (Heritage № 1009), St. Helens, Hull FC, Warrington Wolves and Salford City Reds as a three-quarter, and club level rugby union (RU) for Pontypridd RFC. Background Alan Hunte was born in Wakefield, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. Playing career Alan Hunte made his début for Wakefield Trinity during January 1989, and he played his last match for Wakefield Trinity during the 1988–89 season Hunte was selected to go on the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, and would play for the Lions in the 1992 Rugby League World Cup Final at Wembley in October, though unfortunately it was his dropped ball which led to débuting Australian Steve Renouf scoring the only (and winning) try of the match. He played for St Helens from the interchange bench in their 1996 Challenge Cup Final victory over Bradford Bulls. Hunte played , i.e. number 2, in St. Helens' 4–5 defeat by Wigan in the 1992 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1992–93 season at Knowsley Road, St. Helens, on Sunday 18 October 1992. Hull paid £250,000 for Alan Hunte when he moved from St Helens in 1997 as part of a deal that also included Steve Prescott and Simon Booth, based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £430,400 in 2013. Hunte, together with Anthony Sullivan was the 1997 St Helens season's top try scorer. In the 1997 post season, Hunte was selected to play for Great Britain on the in all three matches of the Super League Test series against Australia. His speed was shown in the third test when he ran down Aussie speedster Andrew Ettingshausen over a 70m run after giving him a 10m start. Hunte later moved to Warrington Wolves and Salford City Reds. Hunte also switched codes to Rugby Union, joining Pontypridd RFC in 2000 in a blaze of publicity. Hunte's career at Pontypridd was short lived, however, as he struggled to come to grips with the vagaries of the Union code. Post playing Hunte currently works within the coaching setup at Salford Red Devils as Head of Youth Development.

He served as Principal of Hart Hall, Oxford for 18 years and was also a prebend of Westminster Abbey. However, after falling out with his patron, John Williams, he sided with William Laud and was reputed to have converted from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism at the end of his life. Life Price was the son of Rees ap Tudor and his wife Margory, who was the daughter of Edward Stanley (constable of Harlech Castle). Price was born in about 1570 in the parish of Llanenddwyn, Dyffyn Ardudwy in Merioneth, North Wales. After attending All Souls College, Oxford as a chorister, he transferred to Jesus College, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree on 16 February 1588 and obtaining his Master of Arts degree on 9 June 1591. After his ordination, he was appointed as rector of Llanfair, near Harlech, in 1591. He was appointed a prebendary of Winchester Cathedral in 1596 and rector of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, Denbighshire in 1601. In 1604, he was appointed as Principal of Hart Hall, Oxford (the predecessor of Hertford College), holding this position until his resignation in 1622. He became rector of Launton, Oxfordshire in 1609 and obtained his Doctorate of Divinity, as a member of New College, Oxford, in 1614. He was one of the five commissioners appointed to draw up new statutes for Jesus College in 1621, and was made a Fellow of the college at that time. Further positions came Price's way, with the influence of his kinsman John Williams, the future Archbishop of York: a prebend of Lincoln Cathedral, when Williams was the Bishop of Lincoln (1621), and a prebend of Westminster Abbey, where Williams was the Dean (1623). He was one of two clerics chosen in 1622 to serve on a commission sent to Ireland to explore grievances, including investigation of the state of the church. Although he was praised for his efforts, he did not receive further advancement, being passed over for appointment as Bishop of St Asaph in 1623 and 1629 and Bishop of Gloucester in 1624. He fell out with Williams over his failure to give Price full support in his attempt to become Archbishop of Armagh (the post going to James Ussher), with Williams pointing to Price's lack of preaching. Thereafter, Price sided with William Laud, the main opponent of Williams within the Westminster Abbey chapter, sharing Laud's like of ceremonial practices in religion. Death and will Price died at Westminster on 15 December 1631 in circumstances that confirmed to some contemporaries the close link between Laudian ceremonials and Roman Catholicism. After unsuccessful surgery for \\"the Torment of the Stone\\", Price received Catholic visitors and told them of his \\"affection and devotion\\" for the Catholic Church. He received Catholic rites and refused to be attended by Anglican clergyman before his death. Price was buried at Westminster Abbey on 21 December 1631. It was said that the delay in burying Price was the reluctance of the prebendaries to conduct a burial service after Price's reported conversion. It was alleged that the story of Price's conversion had been invented by Williams to attack Laud's reputation. The Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke was reported to have remarked to King Charles I, \\"Is this the Orthodox man your Majesty would have made a Bishop the last year? Do but mark him that recommended him unto you in that kind.\\" However, at Laud's trial, when Laud was condemned for his familiarity with the \\"apostate\\" Price, Laud did not deny that Price had converted to Catholicism, but suggested that Williams had worked harder than he had for Price's advancement. Price's religious preferences can be seen from his will in 1631, in which he bequeathed money to beautify the chancel of the church in Llanenddwyn and to add an altar rail, and to endow a sermon at Jesus College in support of bowing at the name of Jesus. He also left money to Hart Hall and Oriel College, Oxford. He referred to Laud as \\"my Noble Laud and worthie auntient friend\\", but did not refer to Williams.

The population at the 2011 Census was 518. Ireton is a corruption of the Saxon Hyre-Tun, meaning Irishman's Enclosure; Kirk was added after the Norman invasion and the building of the church. The village dates back to at least the Bronze Age. Kirk Ireton remains what it has always been, an agricultural village. Following the Second World War the number of working farms dropped from over thirty to half a dozen in the space of 40 years. The last cow was turned down Main Street in the late 1980s, but Fords, Matkins, Rowlands, Walkers and Wards still farm locally as they have done for many generations. Many of the former farm buildings have been adapted into houses. Much of the older part of the village dates back to the 17th century and is mostly built from sandstone, quarried locally. One of the oldest buildings in the village is the Barley Mow pub, which was one of the last premises in the country to accept decimalization, as the 87-year-old landlady, Mrs Lillian Ford did not hold with the new money. The parish previously housed at least four other public houses; The Wheatsheaf, Old Bull's Head, The Windmill and The Gate. Holy Trinity Church is Norman, with the earliest parts being the 3 bayed south and north arcades. The tower and the chancel are Perpendicular. It has an interesting custom known as roping for weddings, when the village children put a rope across the road and the bride and groom are not allowed to leave the church until a toll has been paid in silver by the groom. The village still celebrates a Wakes week, which starts on Trinity Sunday, the church's patronal festival. A procession of villagers is led by a local brass band, from the Barley Mow pub to the church for thanksgiving. Various events take place during the week, with a major all-day event on Saturday. The Post Office closed in 2008, before re-opening as a community shop. The premises were originally stables and the restored hay racks are still in place above shelving along one wall.

These aspects include perioperative care with expert manipulation of patient cardiopulmonary physiology through precise and advanced application of pharmacology, resuscitative techniques, critical care medicine, and invasive procedures. This also includes management of the cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung) machine, which most cardiac procedures require intraoperatively while the heart undergoes surgical correction.Barash, Cullen, Stolelting: Clinical Anesthesia, fifth edition 2006Stoelting RK, Miller RD: Basics of Anesthesia, 4th edition, 2000  Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology Fellowship (U.S.)  right All anesthesiologists obtain either a Doctor of Medicine (MD) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree prior to entering post-medical school graduate medical education. After satisfactory completion of an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or American Osteopathic Association (AOA) accredited one year internship in either internal medicine or surgery and a three-year residency program in all subspecialties of anesthesiology, formal advanced training in Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology is available via a one-year fellowship.. The first Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology fellowship was formed at Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1971. Since then, Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology has become an ACGME approved fellowship (2007), and there are 64 ACGME accredited programs and 212 match positions for the 2017-2018 application year. This fellowship consists of at least eight months of adult Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology, one month dedicated to transesophageal echocardiography, one month in cardiothoracic intensive care unit and two months of elective rotation which includes inpatient or outpatient cardiology or pulmonary medicine, invasive cardiology, medical or surgical critical care and extracorporeal perfusion technology. Fellows are offered the opportunity to participate in clinical research and encouraged to present at national or international conferences after completion of a research project. The arenas of research can be as diverse as neuroprotection,Joel A Kaplan ; Cardiac Anesthesia; Chapter 23, Thoracic Aorta; page 732-737 myocardial protection,Stephen J Thomas; Manual of Cardiac Anesthsia, William A dell, chapter 15, page 387-396, 1984 blood conservation strategies,Stephen J Thomas; Manual of Cardiac Anesthsia, Dennis W Coombs, chapter 16, page 397-418, 1984 and port access surgery. = Cardiac surgical training = Fellows are trained to provide perioperative anesthetic management for patients with severe cardiopulmonary pathology. Some of the cardiac surgeries they train for include the following: coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) both on cardiopulmonary bypass as well as on a beating heart, heart valve surgery, aortic reconstruction requiring deep hypothermic arrest, mechanical ventricular assist device (VAD) placement, thoracic aortic aneurysm repair, aortic dissection repair, heart transplants, lung transplants, heart/lung transplants, and adult congenital heart surgery. Adequate exposure and experience provided in the management of adult patients for cardiac pacemaker and automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator placement, surgical treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, and the complete gamut of invasive cardiologic (catheter-based) and electrophysiological procedures is expected as well. Fellows also gain experience in perioperative medical (anesthetic) management of the cardiac patient, including management of intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP) and ventricular assist devices (VAD), post-operative ICU care, blood transfusion medicine, electrophysiology, and transthoracic echocardiography. Many fellowships also offer opportunity to become familiar with anesthetic techniques for pediatric cardiac surgery and minimally invasive cardiac surgery, however no formal case numbers for ACGME accreditation are required.Michael G D Souza, Daniel M Thys; Textbook of cardiothoracic Anesthesiology, chapter 27 page 711 = Thoracic surgical training = In addition to the focused cardiac training, additional clinical experience within the full one-year fellowship includes anesthetic management of adult patients undergoing thoracic and vascular surgery. Fellows are trained to manage all type of thoracic surgeries which include video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS),Jose Castro, Daniel M Thys; Textbook of cardiothoracic Anesthesiology, chapter 29, 30 page 761-816 open thoracotomy, and advanced airway procedures involving the trachea. Fellows achieve expertise in different techniques of lung isolation and ventilation including double-lumen endotracheal tubes, bronchial blockers, univent tubes under guidance of fiber optic bronchoscopy, and advanced jet ventilation.Joel A Kaplan Thoracic Anesthesia = Advanced monitoring and invasive techniques = The complex nature of cardiothoracic surgery necessitates extra training to acquire the skills needed to be a cardiothoracic anesthesiology consultant. Fellows are trained to achieve expertise in the advanced monitoring techniques including invasive blood pressure, arterial blood gas analysis, cardiac output monitoring, jugular venous oxygen saturation, cerebral oximetry, Bispectral Index (BIS),Acta Anaesthesia Scandinavia: 48;20;2004 Transcranial doppler (TCD),Journal of Vascular Surgery;26;579;1997 and Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).European Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery; 13; 370;1998 Finally, invasive procedures completed by the cardiothoracic anesthesiology fellows include but are not limited to arterial line placement (femoral, axillary, brachial, radial), central venous cannulation (internal jugular, femoral, subclavian), pulmonary artery catheter placement, transvenous pacemaker placement, thoracic epidural analgesia, fiberoptic endotracheal tube placement, 2D/3D transesophageal echocardiography, intraspinal drainage placement, and advanced ultrasound guidance of vascular access.  Echocardiography (TTE and TEE)  CVT anesthesologist at work in University of Miami Echocardiography produces a real-time image of the heart via ultrasound imaging, and can be performed in two or three dimensions. There are two ways of performing echocardiography depending on placement of echocardiography probe: transthoracic or transesophageal. In transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), the probe is placed over the patient's chest wall, while in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE or TOE in the UK), the probe is placed into the esophagus. Regardless of technique, each probe contains a transducer. While transmitting signals, it converts electrical energy to acoustic energy. When receiving signals, it converts acoustic energy to electrical energy, which is processed by the machine to form an image. Various techniques are employed to manipulate the data, including Doppler imaging.Kaplan, Cardiac Anesthesia, third edition 1993Gallagher, Board Stiff TEE Transesophaegeal Edchocardiography, 2004 Transesophageal echocardiography has rapidly become the most powerful monitoring technique and diagnostic tool for the management of cardiac surgical patients, primarily due to the transesophageal echocardiogram probe location and ability to be used intraoperatively. It provides the detailed information about the structure and function of the heart/great vessels in real time, allowing the cardiothoracic anesthesiologist to precisely manage patient physiology while providing updates and direction to members of the surgical team throughout the pre, intra, and post operative time frame of patient care.Board Stiff TEE, transesophageal echocardiography, second edition. 2013. Gallagher, Sciarra, Ginsberg After successful completion of the fellowship with subspecialty training in TEE, cardiothoracic anesthesiology fellows may sit for examination leading to board certification in echocardiography. The examination, also known as the Advanced PTEeXAM, is administered by the National Board of Echocardiography (NBE). . In addition to passing the test, fellows can become board certified only after performing 150 exams as well as reviewing an additional 150 exams with a board certified cardiologist/cardiothoracic anesthesiologist.  Cardio-pulmonary bypass  CABG surgery with CPB Assembled CPB circuit ready to use Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a technique in which heart-lung machine temporarily takes over the function of the heart and lungs during surgery. The CPB is operated by the perfusionist. During the heart operation, the perfusionist takes over the heart function. The perfusionist works in close relation with the anesthesiologist and the surgeon. Blood is drained from the venous (deoxygenated) circulation, and is cycled through the CPB machine. While in the machine, the blood is filtered, heated or cooled, and infused with oxygen. Subsequently, it is pumped back into the arterial (oxygenated) circulation, thereby bypassing the heart and lungs and maintaining the perfusion of the vital organs. While the step by step process for preparation and initiation of CPB can vary between institution and type of surgery, a typical scenario is as follows. After a median sternotomy, a surgical retractor is placed by the surgeon to optimize exposure of the heart. At this time, heparin is given to thin the blood to prevent thrombus from forming while on CPB. The surgeon places a cannula in the right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein to withdraw blood from the venous circulation. The perfusionist uses gravity to drain the venous blood into the CPB machine, and a separate cannula, usually placed in the aorta or femoral artery, is used to return blood to the arterial circulation. The process of preparation, initiation, and separation of cardiopulmonary bypass is a critical time during cardiac surgery. Some studies have even considered formalizing this period of time, much like the \\"sterile cockpit\\" process in critical steps of aviation . The communication, while a team effort, is led and directed by the cardiothoracic anesthesiologist, as the surgeon is focused on acquiring and maintaining adequate exposure. This can even extend to placement of the cannulae for CPB preparation, as the cardiothoracic anesthesiologist often directs the surgical placement via real- time TEE data. As such, this responsibility demands that the cardiothoracic anesthesiologist have a thorough knowledge of the advanced physiology, principles, practical application and management of CPB. After completion of the \\"on bypass\\" surgical correction, preparations are made to separate the patient from CPB. In other words, the heart and lung are prepared to receive, oxygenate, and pump the blood which had immediately previous been done by the CPB machine. Separation can be complicated by the CPB machine, the patient's inherent pathology/physiology, surgical correction, and the dynamic interaction of all three. Cardiopulmonary bypass has effects on the patient's hematology, physiology, and immunology, which must be acutely managed by the cardiothoracic anesthesiologist in order to ensure effective separation from CPB.  Role of cardiothoracic anesthesiologists in non-cardiac surgery  Cardiac Anesthesiologists performing diagnostic intraoperative TEE in a case of sudden cardiac arrest during hysterectomy Patients with cardiothoracic pathology who present for non-cardiothoracic surgery are at increased risk for serious perioperative complications. Cardiothoracic anesthesiologists are often consulted by their colleagues to provide expert management during intraoperative hemodynamic instability or cardiac arrest by evaluating heart function with the aid of TEE and placement of other invasive advanced hemodynamic monitors, such as pacing swans.Board Stiff TEE, transesophageal echocardiography, second edition. 2013.

She was built in 1872 in Dumbarton, Scotland, especially for the Hajj pilgrim trade, and was owned by Singapore-based merchant Syed Mahomed Alsagoff. In 1880, her British officers abandoned her when she listed and appeared to be sinking, leaving more than 700 passengers on board. The event inspired the plot of Joseph Conrad's novel Lord Jim.  The incident On 17 July 1880, Jeddah left Singapore bound for Penang and subsequently Jeddah with 953 passengers – 778 men, 147 women, and 67 children – on board. She also had 600 tonnes of general cargo, mostly sugar, garron wood, and general merchandise. The passengers were Muslim pilgrims travelling to Mecca and Medina for pilgrimage. A nephew of the ship's owner, Syed Omar al-Sagoff (Arabic: سيد عمر السقاف Saiyid ʿUmar al-Saqqāf) was among the passengers. Her multinational crew included a British captain (Joseph Lucas Clark), two European officers (the first mate, named Williams, and the second mate), and a European third engineer. The captain's wife, who was also a European, was also on board. On 3 August 1880, while off Ras Hafun in hurricane-force winds and heavy seas, the ship's boilers drifted from their seatings. The crew used wedges to reseat the boilers. On 6 August, the weather worsened further and the wedges holding the boilers in place began to give way. Leaks developed and the ship stopped to make repairs. Thereafter she proceeded slowly during the night of 6–7 August with only one boiler lit. However, the leaks increased and despite the efforts of the crew and passengers trying to bail out the water, she began to take on more water due to leaks in the supply lines in the bottom. She again stopped for repairs, during which time she began to roll heavily and her boilers broke loose and all connection pipes were washed away, rendering her engines ineffective. Her crew rigged her sails to try to use wind power, but the sails blew away. On 7 August, while Jeddah drifted in the Indian Ocean off Socotra and Guardafui, Captain Clark and most of her British officers and crew prepared to launch the lifeboats. Upon discovering this, the pilgrims, who until then were helping bail out water from the engine room, tried to prevent the crew from abandoning them. A fight ensued, resulting in a few of the crew falling overboard and drowning. The officers escaped in the starboard lifeboat, leaving the pilgrims to their fate. The Board of Trade inquiry proceedingsBoard of Trade Wreck Report for Jeddah, 1881 note that a scuffle broke out while the lifeboat was being launched; the passengers threw whatever they could onto the lifeboat to prevent it from being lowered, and pulled away the first mate, who was lowering the boat from the ship, causing him to fall overboard. The first mate later was pulled into the lifeboat. Thus, the captain, his wife, the chief engineer, the first officer and several other crew members escaped in the lifeboat, leaving the passengers and a few of the officers and crew on their own on board Jeddah. The British convict ship SS Scindian picked up the people in the lifeboat a few hours later at 10:00 a.m. on 8 August and took them to Aden, where they told a story of violent passengers murdering two of the ship′s engineers and reported that Jeddah had sunk near Yemen with great loss of life among her passengers. However, Jeddah did not sink. Her passengers later reported that after the captain's lifeboat had been launched, the second mate had tried to escape in another lifeboat along with a few passengers. The other passengers had prevented this, and in the confusion that ensued, the lifeboat fell into the water, drowning the second mate and two passengers on board the lifeboat with him. Thereafter the remaining 20 crew members, including two officers, with the help of the passengers, bailed the water out of the ship's engine room. They then hoisted distress signals, which the Blue Funnel Line steamship , sailing from Shanghai to London with 680 passengers on board, sighted while Jeddah′s passengers and crew were trying to beach Jeddah off Ras Feeluk, near Bandar Maryah. Antenor approached Jeddah, assisted Jeddah′s crew and passengers in making her stable, and then towed her into the port of Aden, where she arrived on 11 August to much astonishment. Almost all the pilgrims had survived. Fate of crew and passengers  In all, the official inquiry established the number of people rescued from Jeddah as 18 crew members (one of whom was working his passage), one second engineer, one supercargo, and 992 passengers (778 men, 147 women, and 67 children, not counting infants in arms). In all, 18 people died during the incident, including the second mate, three Khalasis, and 14 passengers. Court of inquiry A court of inquiry was held at Aden by the resident and sessions judge G. R. Goodfellow. The inquiry criticised Jeddah′s chief engineer for incorrect operation of the boilers, thus aggravating matters. It also found the actions of Captain Clark in swinging out Jeddah′s lifeboats prematurely and subsequently launching the boats – dismaying the passengers – unprofessional and that he showed a \\"want of judgement and tact.\\" It also found him \\"guilty of gross misconduct in being indirectly the cause of the deaths of the second mate and ten natives, seven crew and three passengers, and in abandoning his disabled ship with nearly 1,000 souls on board to their fate\\". His master′s certificate was suspended for three years. The court of inquiry also criticised the conduct of the Chief Mate Williams. It commended the actions of the master and first mate of Antenor. The court was also critical that 1000 passengers could be allowed on board a ship such as this in inclement weather. Aftermath and Joseph Conrad's book Lord Jim The incident took the United Kingdom in general and London in particular by storm. Newspapers were filled with reports and letters to the editors, from the public, from people who had actually sailed on pilgrim ships and described the grim conditions on board, and from merchants and owners of pilgrim ships. The Jeddah incident inspired Joseph Conrad, who had landed in Singapore in 1883, to write the novel Lord Jim. He used the name SS Patna for his fictional pilgrim ship.

He was devoted Jesuit and religious polemicist, interested in genealogy and heraldry. He served as a censor, bishops advisor and Deputy Chancellor of Lithuania. Bogdan Suchodolski PAN: Historia nauki polskiej Biography Albert and his brother Casimir were born in the House of Perkūnas in Kaunas (or Romainiai according to other sources) to a poor Lithuanian noble family. They bore Kościesza coat of arms, but without a cross-bar. He studied rhetoric, philosophy and theology in which mastered title of doctor in 1645. Gabriel Korbut: Literatura polska od początków do wojny światowej Later he was appointed as a professor of Alma Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Iesu, teacher of logic, physics, metaphysics and ethic. Together with his brothers he joined Jesuit order and founded its colleges in Kaunas, Vilnius and Polatsk.Kasper Niesiecki: Herbarz polski In 1653 he became rector of Vilnius Academy. He died on 6 October 1677 in Vilnius. Wijuk Kojałowicz was famous for his rhetoric talent and research in the Lithuanian history. He is considered one of the best and most productive historical writers of the 17th century. Among his forty publications most important is \\"Historiae Lituanae\\", which was the first full research on the history of Lithuania.  History of Lithuania  Wijuk Kojałowicz was devoted to the Lithuanian history and his \\"Historiae Lituanae\\" is considered, next to Maciej Stryjkowski's \\"Kronika Polska, Litewska, Żmódzka\\" and Alexander Guagnini's \\"Sarmatiae Europaeae Descriptio\\", as one of the most important studies of history of Lithuania from the mid-seventeenth century. It was used as main source for Lithuanian history until the 19th century. The study continued the tradition of Lithuanian Chronicles by glorifying the heroic past of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, by voicing the patriotic sentiments and by encouraging Lithuanian nobles to protect the territorial integrity of their fatherland.M. Jučas: Lietuvos metraščiai (p. 8-9) Wijuk-Kojałowicz also focused on the imperfection of human memory. Memory is, according to him, a defective instrument, with time it tends to remember incorrectly, incompletely, or not at all. The technology of human memory, in Wijuk-Kojałowicz's view, is always uncertain and doubtful, even the written testimony is bound to mutate and to be distorted.Kojelavičius: Lietuvos istorija a, b-(p.43), c-(p.384), d-(p.489-512) Kojałowicz's implied that the goal of history is nothing else but to preserve memory of all things past. The communal or collective memory is firmest when it is written down: In the foreword of the first volume of this work entitled \\"An opportunity to write the history of Lithuania\\", he admitted that he had not just translated Stryjkowski's history but had revised it \\"according to the requirements and laws of a written treatise...\\" . According to Wijuk-Kojałowicz, Stryjkowski's history, that was written in Polish was not accessible to foreign readers, and it also broke rhetorics and history principles in many places. Because of his critical stance towards Stryjkowski's \\"Kronika...\\" Wijuk-Kojałowicz revised it so, that it would teach the young not only the history of their country, but also the Latin language. His goal, as he admitted himself, was to rewrite Stryjkowski's history in Latin according to the rhetoric principles and historical truth. Kojałowicz's history moved away from metaphorical representation favored by Stryjkowski toward a more balanced description. He replaced Stryjkowski's metaphorical style of historical writing preoccupied with analogy and thereby closer to poetry with a rhetoric focused on the mechanics of telling a linear story. Despite of his critical attitude, Wijuk- Kojałowicz's History of Lithuania reiterated Stryjkowski's chronological and factual errors. As in \\"Kronika...\\", the death dates of the Lithuanian Grand Dukes Algirdas and Gediminas were incorrect, and the names of Algirdas's sons and uncles were mixed up.J. Jurginis: A. Kojelavičiaus 'Lietuvos istorija' ir jos reikšmė (p.22-23) The change of places and names, confused in the course of many centuries, sometimes obscured the truth so that it became impossible to distinguish between truth and the fiction for the states were formed during barbarian times when there were no writers. Because of such reasons there remained very few stories about the origins and customs of the Lithuanians, and thus many widespread stories are questionable or false. Kojałowicz was skeptical about the possibility of history written sine ira et studio, without anger and without preconception, without affection and hatred. Wijuk- Kojałowicz described the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as a state consisting of two states, the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and two nations, the Lithuanian and Polish, which were supposed to have equal rights. He extensively described the Union of Lublin which was, in his opinion, a significant event in the history of the Grand Duchy. The Lithuanian nobles were convinced that they needed this union but its conditions had to guarantee and preserve the dignity of the Lithuanian state and Lithuanian nation: In his history, Wijuk-Kojałowicz did not fail to record the continuous rivalry between the Lithuanians and Poles for their rights and privileges and their constant distrust of each other. Wijuk-Kojałowicz regarded the religion as the most important attribute of national belonging. According to him, neither ethnicity nor language distinguished Lithuanians from Ruthenians but their different creed. Roman Christianity became a definitive composite of a noble's identity. Wijuk-Kojałowicz wrote that: In Kojałowicz's works, the nation was, first of all, imagined as a community with common interests and a shared past. His ideas about the historical nation were not only a reflection of cultural forces in the state, they were instrumental in forging popular imagination of the historical community of the Grand Duchy. The word \\"nation\\" (natio), which he often used, was expressed as a problematic ambivalence in imagining and fictionalizing the community of Lithuania.

The ensemble proved so cohesive that all twelve of its members decided to continue playing together after the war, under the name Phil Tate & His Orchestra, taking a residency at Leas Cliff Hall in Folkestone. Their instrumentation was unusual, featuring five saxes and three flutes. After appearing in the 1951 film Green Grow the Rushes, they took their next residency at the Hammersmith Palais and signed to Oriole Records. Tate's orchestra played at the Hammersmith for a full decade, then moved to the Ilford Palais. Tate hosted the BBC show Non-Stop-Pop, where he interviewed The Beatles on 30 July 1963. On radio, he was best known for his 144 appearances in Music While You Work. In 1964, his orchestra took up at the Locarno Ballroom in Streatham; the next year they appeared on the BBC program Music Through Midnight. Tate's most longstanding association came in 1965, when he became musical director for the Miss World Pageant. He disbanded his orchestra in 1967, and ran Mecca Agencies in addition to his duties with Miss World, where he remained until his retirement in 1992. He served as director of the Music Users' Council from 1992 to 2000, after which he retired. Tate died on 9 December 2005, at the age of 83.
