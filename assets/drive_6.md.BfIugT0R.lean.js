The film released by NoShame on DVD in the United States. Reception Curti stated that the film was \\"unusually well-received by critics\\", including Vittorio Spiga who praised the film as Massi's best work, referring to Massi as managing \\"to renew the genre somehow: by borrowing the style of the Italian Western, its violence and characters, while taking the spectacular angle and the fast pacing from American cinema.\\" Tom Milne of the Monthly Film Bulletin stated that \\"Although Stelvio Massi places numbing reliance on the zoom lens, it is competently enough done, with a sound performance by Maurizio Merli in the Eastwood role.\\" Milne also commented on the dubbing, declaring it \\"horribly dubbed and stultifyingly tedious.\\" In a retrospective review, Curti declared the film to be \\"perhaps Stelvio Massi's best effort, and one of the better late Italian poliziotteschi\\" References=FootnotesSources * External links * Category:1978 films Category:Italian films Category:Italian- language films Category:1970s crime thriller films Category:1970s action thriller films Category:Poliziotteschi films Category:Films scored by Stelvio Cipriani Category:Films set in Rome ","title":"Convoy Busters"},{"id":"24507701","text":"Flying Heroes is a fantasy action game produced by Take 2 Interactive, Illusion Softworks, and Pterodon.  Gameplay  Flying Heroes is an arena based shooter game that takes place on various flying creatures. There are four clans to choose from, with varying creatures or machines for players. The four clans are: Sky Knights, Lizard Riders, Hammercraft, and Magion. Each clan offers different options, such as different amounts of health, different weapons and different flying crafts. There is also a multiplayer mode. In the beginning, or in the demo, only Lizard Riders and Magion are available choices; Sky Knights and Hammercraft become available when the career mode is beaten.  Career Mode  In career mode the player battles in three different leagues in a variety of arenas; the Iron league initially, followed by the Silver league and culminating in the Golden league. In order to proceed onto the next league, the player must be the highest ranked pilot in the league at the end of each season. Each league dictates the flying machines/creatures available for purchase, from the weakest in the Iron league, to the strongest in the Golden league. The length of each match, matches per season, currency reward per frag, the skill and quantity of enemies also increases in line with each league. After completing the Golden league, a cut-scene will show aliens (looking like Kamacuras) coming down demanding some kind of payment before the final boss battle starts. = League Matches = Each league match is a death-match, with the objective being to shoot down as many opponents as possible, whilst the player tries not to get shot down themselves. The reward for shooting down an opponent is one frag, with two awarded for eliminating the current leading pilot. When the player is shot down by one of their own projectiles or spells/abilities, one frag is lost from their score. If the player shoots down a teammate (Golden League players get an NPC wingman), two frags are deducted from their score. At the end of the match the pilot with the most frags wins and frags are converted into a currency reward for all pilots: *$50: Iron League *$250: Silver League *$750: Golden League The second kind of league match is called a 'Frag Limit', in game they are classed as training matches. This is because they take place in the same arena as the main league match, but results obtained are not counted in the league rankings. The rules are similar to a standard league match, except that the winner is the pilot who reaches a pre- determined number of frags first. All other rules are the same, including currency reward values. These matches are always done as an alternative to a special match or quest, described below. =Special Matches and Quests= During the career there are various side missions that serve to complete an objective: such as locating three statuettes. The player can choose to participate in a side quest if they wish or do a training (frag limit) match. The player can even elect to skip straight to the next main league match, however the chance to earn any revenue is instantly forfeited. There is no prejudice on the player on choosing any of these options, as the game does not employ a renown based system. The different types of secondary match are described below. Tag The object in this match is not to get touched or 'tagged' by the pilot who currently has the 'Tag' - as it is referred to in-game. Each participant is given two minutes of time at the start of the match, which is deducted for any duration in which they have the Tag. Five seconds of time is gained when the player shoots down an opponent, but five seconds are lost when the player is shot down. The currently tagged pilot is invulnerable to any kind or attack from other pilots, however if the time on their tag counter expires they are eliminated from the match permanently. The initial tagged pilot is determined randomly and the winner is the pilot with the most time, on their counter, at the end of the match or the only pilot left surviving, if all others are eliminated. The tagged pilot is easily evident due to their violet color. Destruction of Cannons The object of this type of match is to clear a defined area of cannons - the area being the area that the match is taking place. The player is limited either by time or three lives in which to accomplish the objective. Upon completion a cash reward is received. Object Acquisition The object is to acquire all of the designated objects and the player is limited either by time or three lives. There are usually opponents, mines or cannons in the arena, serving to complicate the task. Upon completion a cash reward is received. Elimination of Selected Opponents The objective here is to shoot down the selected opponent(s). The player is limited either by time or three lives. Upon elimination of the opponent(s) a cash reward is received. Reception Flying Heroes was released to mixed reviews. The positive reviews included IGN awarding it an 8.3/10Flying Heroes Review - PC - IGN Eurogamer 9/10,Flying Heroes Review - PC - Eurogamer.net and GameSpot UK 7.8/10. The less positive reviews included, GameZone, who awarded 3/10, PCZone, who awarded 47/100, and PC Gamer, who awarded 51/100. The game has sold over 100,000 units as of 2002.

The film was adapted from John Updike's 1960 novel by screenplay writer Howard B. Kreitsek, who also served as producer. The film starred James Caan as Rabbit Angstrom, Carrie Snodgress as Rabbit's wife Janice, and Anjanette Comer as his girlfriend Ruth. The movie co-starred Jack Albertson as Coach Marty Tothero, Arthur Hill as Rev. Jack Eccles, and Henry Jones and Josephine Hutchinson as Rabbit's parents.New York Times Movies entry for the film adaptation Plot In Reading, Pennsylvania, former high school basketball star Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom is dissatisfied with both his failure to find a career and with his loveless marriage to Janice, an alcoholic who is pregnant with a child neither of them wants. Following an argument with Janice, Rabbit looks up his old basketball coach Marty Tothero, who is now living in squalor. Marty decides that Rabbit needs a woman, and he introduces him to Ruth, a part-time prostitute. When Rabbit moves in with Ruth, Jack Eccles, the family minister, tries to persuade him to return to his wife, but Rabbit refuses. Eventually, Rabbit also becomes disenchanted with Ruth, and when Janice has her baby, Rabbit goes to the hospital and effects a reconciliation. For a time, they live in relative harmony, but Janice's insistence on a less active sex life leads to bitterness, and Rabbit again takes off. Janice resumes her solitary drinking, this time with tragic results; while in a drunken stupor, she accidentally drowns the baby. Learning of his child's death, Rabbit returns home and finds that everyone holds him responsible. At the funeral, Rabbit responds to his parents' and in-laws' accusing glances by screaming his innocence. Fleeing from the cemetery, he goes to Ruth's apartment; but Ruth, who is now pregnant with his child, refuses to let him in unless he agrees to divorce Janice and marry her. Although he promises to do so, Rabbit is still unable to make a commitment to anyone and runs away again.

Microscopic examination of the tissue can provide information needed to diagnose, monitor or treat problems of the kidney. A renal biopsy can be targeted to a particular lesion, for example a tumour arising from the kidney (targeted renal biopsy). More commonly, however, the biopsy is non- targeted as medical conditions affecting the kidney typically involve all kidney tissue indiscriminately. In the latter situation, any sufficiently- sized piece of kidney tissue can be used. A native renal biopsy is one in which the patient's own kidneys are biopsied. In a transplant renal biopsy, the kidney of another person that has been transplanted into the patient is biopsied. Transplant kidney biopsy can be performed when nothing is apparently wrong with the transplant kidney for the purposes of surveillance for hidden disease (protocol transplant biopsy). This is typically done at 0, 3 and 12 months post-transplant according to a transplant unit protocol. Biopsy of the transplanted kidney taken during the transplant operation is termed implantation transplant biopsy or post-perfusion transplant biopsy depending on the timing of the biopsy with respect to key stages of the operation. When the transplanted kidney is not working properly, biopsy may be undertaken to identify the cause of dysfunction. This is referred to as an indication transplant biopsy, because something has prompted the performance of the biopsy. Renal biopsy may be performed with the aid of \\"real-time\\" medical imaging to guide the positioning of biopsy equipment (imaging-guided renal biopsy). Alternatively, a biopsy may be performed without imaging-guidance using indirect assessments of position such as \\"needle-swing\\" to confirm appropriate placement of biopsy equipment (blind renal biopsy). History Before 1951, the only way of obtaining kidney tissue from a live person was through an open operation. In 1951, Danish physicians Poul Iversen and Claus Brun described a method involving needle biopsy which has become the new standard. Recent widespread availability of real-time imaging guidance using ultrasound or CT scanning having improved perceived safety of the procedure. Indications Kidney biopsy is performed on selected patients with kidney disease. It is most commonly used when less invasive tests are insufficient. The decision on whether or not to proceed to a kidney biopsy is usually made by a nephrologist. The following are examples of the most common reasons for native kidney biopsy: * Haematuria (or blood in the urine) can occur with a number of conditions that affect the kidneys and urinary tract. While renal biopsy is not indicated in all cases of haematuria, it may be performed in those with glomerular haematuria (blood that is thought to come from damage to the glomerulus) or when combined with features of progressive renal disease (e.g. increasing proteinuria, elevated blood pressure and kidney failure). One example is the nephritic syndrome. * Proteinuria (or protein in the urine) occurs in many renal conditions. Renal biopsy is usually reserved for patients with high or increasing levels of proteinuria, or for patients who have proteinuria along with other signs of renal dysfunction. One example is the nephrotic syndrome. * Kidney failure (or impaired kidney function due to kidney injury) can occur abruptly (acute kidney failure) or progress over a period of time (chronic kidney disease). The cause of acute kidney failure can usually be determined without kidney biopsy. Biopsy is performed in those instances where the cause is uncertain. * Targeted kidney biopsy can be used to obtain tissue from a tumour arising from or adjacent the kidney. Transplant kidney biopsy is performed in the following circumstances: * For surveillance of hidden disease involving the transplant kidney, so-called protocol renal biopsy undertaken at fixed intervals post-transplantation. * When the transplant kidney is not working as well as expected, or when there is a deterioration in function. In these instances, biopsy is performed to exclude rejection, BK nephropathy, drug-toxicity or recurrence of the disease that caused kidney failure in the first place. Contraindications The safety of renal biopsy is affected by the following conditions: Absolute * bleeding diathesis * uncontrolled severe high blood pressure * uncooperative patient * presence of a solitary native kidney Relative * azotemia or uraemia * certain anatomical abnormalities of the kidney * skin infection at the biopsy site * medications that interfere with clotting (e.g. warfarin or heparin) * pregnancy * urinary tract infection * obesity Procedure=Before biopsy Like most invasive medical procedures, a renal biopsy is not without risk (see Complications). A nephrologist will have to satisfy themselves that a renal biopsy is of appropriate benefit to justify the risks of the procedure before proceeding. This will include careful consideration of patient characteristics and other clinical information obtained from history, examination and other less-invasive investigations. Blood testing may be done before the biopsy to ensure that there is no evidence of infection or a blood clotting abnormality. Further, an ultrasound or other imaging study of the kidney may be performed before biopsy to exclude structural problems of the kidney, which may theoretically increase the risk of the procedure. These include hydronephrosis, pre-existing arteriovenous fistula in the kidney, cystic kidney disease and small, shrunken kidneys. To decrease the risk of bleeding, patients are usually advised to avoid medicines that impair clotting for one to two weeks before the biopsy. These medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin and warfarin. Desmopressin may be administered intravenously in the hope of reversing the clotting disturbance that accompanies kidney failure (uraemic coagulopathy). Strict control of blood pressure is also sought to reduce bleeding risk. Prior to the procedure, informed consent is usually taken. Arrangements will also be made to ensure that appropriate post-biopsy care and supervision is in place. Fasting is usually not required. However, this will depend on centre preference. During biopsy Renal biopsy is typically performed by a nephrologist or interventional radiologist. The biopsy is planned with the assistance of ultrasound or CT scanning to visualise the location and depth of the kidneys immediately before the biopsy. In the case of a native kidney biopsy, the procedure will be performed with the patient lying on their stomach (prone) or on their side (lateral decubitus position). For transplant renal biopsy, the patient lies on their back (supine). The biopsy procedure usually takes about 15 minutes. The site of biopsy is prepared antiseptic solution and sterile drapes are applied. If real-time imaging is used, sterile coverings will be placed on the equipment. The person performing the procedure (proceduralist) will wash their hands and don a sterile gown and gloves. A mask may or may not be worn. The biopsy is usually performed while the patient is awake or with mild sedation. Use of a general anaesthetic is typically not required. After the site is prepared, the proceduralist injects local anaesthetic into the skin, through the subcutaneous tissue and down to and around the kidney. There may be a sharp sting as the local anaesthetic is injected. After a few seconds, the site will be numb and only a sensation of pressure should be felt. A small 1‚Äì2 mm incision is made to allow insertion of the biopsy needle. In most cases, real-time imaging will be used to guide positioning of the local anaesthetic and biopsy needles. In the case of blind biopsy, this will not be used. A loud click may be heard as the spring-loaded biopsy needle is fired into the kidney to obtain a tissue sample. The resulting core of kidney tissue is usually less than 1 mm in diameter and up to 1 cm long. This may be done more than once to obtain sufficient kidney tissue. A pathologist or pathology scientist may be present at the biopsy to examine the core(s) of kidney tissue for adequacy under a low power microscope. They will inform the person performing the procedure about how much kidney tissue was obtained, specifically how of biopsy sample is kidney cortex and how much is kidney medulla. In some centres, this role will be performed by the proceduralist with the naked eye. When enough kidney tissue has been obtained, pressure will be applied to the biopsy site. After a period of time, it will be cleaned and dressed. Sutures are usually not required. After biopsy Post-biopsy care will differ from centre to centre. Most hospitals will observe patients who have had renal biopsy for 4‚Äì6 hours to minimise the risk of bleeding. Blood pressure and urine are frequently monitored to ensure the patient is not suffering any bleeding complications. Mild-moderate pain is managed with simple analgesics such as paracetamol or acetaminophen. Severe pain is usually an indication of bleeding complication, and may prompt a longer hospital stay and further tests. If there are no observed complications during this period, most hospitals will discharge patients and allow them to return home. Other centres will admit patients who have had renal biopsy overnight for observation. Most hospitals will discharge patients post-renal biopsy with written instructions on what to do if complications occur. Complications Serious complications of renal biopsy are uncommon. The risk of complications will vary from centre to centre based on experience and other technical factors. The most common complication of kidney biopsy is bleeding. This reflects the density of blood vessels within the kidney and observation that individuals with kidney failure take longer to stop bleeding after trauma (uraemic coagulopathy). Bleeding complications include a collection of blood adjacent to or around the kidney (perinephric haematoma), bleeding into the urine with passage of blood stained urine (macroscopic haematuria) or bleeding from larger blood vessels that lie adjacent the kidney. If blood clots in the bladder, this can obstruct the bladder and lead to urinary retention. The majority of bleeding that occurs following renal biopsy usually resolves on its own without long-term damage. Less commonly, the bleeding may be brisk (causing shock) or persistent (causing anaemia) or both. In these circumstances, treatment with blood transfusion or surgery may be required. Surgical options to control bleeding include less invasive catheter-delivered particles to block bleeding vessels (angioembolisation) or open surgery. In most cases, bleeding can be controlled and the kidneys are not lost. Rarely, a heavily damaged kidney may need to be removed. Infection is rare with modern sterile operating procedures. Damage to surrounding structures, such as bowel and bladder (more likely with transplant kidney biopsy), can occur. Occasionally, a biopsy will have to be abandoned prematurely due to technical issues such as inaccessible or small kidneys, obscured kidneys, difficult to penetrate kidneys or observation of bleeding complication. Further, after the biopsy has been completed, microscopic examination of the tissue may reveal heavily scarred tissue prompting recommendation for re-biopsy to avoid sampling error. As with all treatments, there is a risk of allergy to the disinfectant solution, sedation, local anaesthetic and materials (latex gloves, drapes, dressings) used for the procedure. Finally, the biopsy needle may join an artery and vein in the kidney, resulting in the formation of an arteriovenous fistula. These usually do not cause problems and close on their own. They may be monitored over time with repeat Doppler ultrasonography. Rarely, they may result in intermittent bleeding into the urine or may grow in size and threaten to burst. In these instances, the fistula may be closed surgically or with angioembolisation.

Upon extinction of the senior line of the family, his great- grandson succeeded to the royal throne as King Charles Albert of Sardinia, while his great-great-grandson, Victor Emmanuel II, became King of Italy. Biography Louis Victor was born at the H√¥tel de Soissons, the Parisian home of his ancestor Marie de Bourbon, Countess of Soissons, to Victor Amadeus I, Prince of Carignano and his wife Maria Vittoria di Savoia. His father was a grandson of Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano and thus a descendant of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy and Infanta Catherine Michelle of Spain. He was doubly descended from the latter pair, as his mother was a legitimated daughter of Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia and his mistress Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes. One of five children, he was the second son of his parents; his older brother Joseph Victor died and infant in 1716. Louis Victor was thus heir to the cadet branch of the House of Savoy-Carignano from birth. His older sister Anne Th√©r√®se married the Frenchman Charles de Rohan and was Princess de Soubise by marriage. Anne Th√©r√®se was the mother of Madame de Gu√©m√©n√©, official governess to the children of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI. Louis Victor grew up in Paris, where his father was both a courtier and an inveterate gambler. Heavily in debt in Piedmont, and sued by his sisters whose dowries he had gambled away, he had fled to France where he lived so luxurious a life that his son was forced to sell significant family assets in that country. He later moved to Piedmont, between Turin and Racconigi. On 4 May 1740 Louis Victor married Princess Christine of Hesse-Rotenburg-Rheinfels, a sister of the Sardinian king's deceased wife Queen Polyxena (1706‚Äì1736). The couple had nine children. The most renowned of their children, Marie Th√©r√®se, is known to history as the Princesse de Lamballe whose close friendship with Marie Antoinette led to her brutal death during the French Revolution. In 1741, Louis Victor's father died and he became the Prince of Carignano. The fief of Carignano had belonged to the Savoys since 1418, but the fact that it was part of Piedmont, only twenty km south of Turin, meant that it could be a \\"princedom\\" for Thomas in name only, being endowed neither with independence nor revenues of substance. Louis Victor lost his wife in September, 1778 and died himself on 16 December 1778 at the Palazzo Carignano, the Turin residence of the Savoy-Carignano family. Since 1835 his wife's grave has been in Turin's Basilica of Superga, as is that of Louis Victor. His descendants include Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples and Amedeo, 5th Duke of Aosta, rival claimants for the defunct throne of the Kingdom of Italy, as well as Prince Lorenz of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este, head of a cadet branch of the former imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine.

It was placed in the subgenus Halodeima by Pearson in 1914, making its full scientific name Holothuria (Halodeima) atra. It is the type species of the subgenus. Description Holothuria atra is a sea cucumber that can grow to a length of but is a more common size. It has a smooth, pliable, entirely black skin which often has sand adhering to it, especially in smaller individuals. The mouth is on the underside at one end and is surrounded by a fringe of 20, black, branched tentacles. The anus is at the other end.Holothuria atra Marine Species Identification Portal.

It is found on the seabed, in shallow waters on reefs and sand flats and in seagrass meadows at depths of up to . Its colouring makes it conspicuous but it is very often camouflaged by a coating of sand which may also serve to keep it cool by protecting it from the sun's rays. It favours reef flats where it is not fully exposed to the waves but the water is well aerated, and shallows beside slabs of rock from under which cool water wells out when the tide retreats. In such places it is often found in pools above the low tide mark which are warmed by the sun during the day. Holothuria atra seems to tolerate these high temperatures well and individuals appeared healthy and were feeding when the water temperature rose as high as 39 ¬∞C.Ecological Observations on the Sea Cucumbers Holothuria atra and H. leucospilota at Rongelap Atoll, Marshall Islands Retrieved 2012-01-20. Biology Holothuria atra is an omnivore, sifting through the sediment with its tentacles and feeding on detritus and other organic matter. As a defence against predators, Holothuria atra emits a toxic red fluid when its skin is rubbed or damaged. When attacked, it does not eject Cuvierian tubules in the way that some sea cucumbers do, but instead extrudes its internal organs through its anus. It is not possible to distinguish between male and female Holothuria atra externally. Maturity is reached at a body length of about and spawning mostly takes place during the summer and autumn although in equatorial waters it may take place all year round. Holothuria atra is also fissiparous, meaning that it can reproduce by transverse fission.C. Conand, Asexual reproduction by fission in Holothuria atra: variability of some parameters in populations from the tropical Indo-Pacific, Oceanologica acta, 1996, vol. 19, no 3-4, pp. 189-475 (29 ref.), pp. 209-216. It is mostly smaller individuals that divide in this way. A constriction appears, becomes deeper and deeper and after some time the integument separates leaving two relatively wide but short individuals. No sand adheres to the newly separated surfaces as there are no tube feet present to retain the grains. Ecology Holothuria atra is often found associated with the polychaete worm Gastrolepidia clavigera, a black worm which crawls about over the sea cucumber's skin. Holothuria atra seems to have few natural predators. Lissocarcinus orbicularis, a small crab, is known to live on this species in a commensal relationship.The relationship between holothurians and the portulid crab Lissocarcinus orbicularis Uses In the Pacific Islands, Holothuria atra is collected by diving or by wading at low tide, and used for human consumption; its commercial value, however, is low.

The screenplay by John Allen Nelson and Max Strom is based on a story by executive producer Takashige Ichise. The film had its theatrical release in Japan in December 1993, followed by theatrical release in South Korea in 1994. The film had its video premiere in the United States in 1995 and its DVD premiere in Russia in 2002. Premise American FBI agent Nick Davis (Viggo Mortensen) works undercover, rising through the ranks of the Yakuza to infiltrate their operations. Adopted by the Tendo crime family, he is entangled with the Italian Mafia, the Yakuza, and the FBI. In the end he must decide what is most important to him.

They concluded that overall, American Yakuza \\"is a surprisingly powerful portrayal of the loyalties that exist in the underworld, where violence and betrayal are a way of life.\\" Reviewer Anton Bitel wrote after considering Viggo Mortensen's acting in this 1993 film, and how he is better remembered now as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings films, this one \\"will leave viewers wondering why Mortensen‚Äôs talents were not generally recognized a lot earlier.\\" He also notes that one of the film's ironies is that when the Mafia takes on the Yakuza in the film and \\"boast of their 'American drive and know-how'\\", they forget the similarities in that a century earlier they were just as eager as the Yakuza \\"to get a foothold in this country‚Äù. Bitel feels that \\"American Yakuza is in effect ‚ÄòThe Godfather: the next Generation‚Äô ‚Äì an immigrant saga of family, blood and assimilation that just happens to be set in the world of organized crime.\\" He found flaws in that parts of the film \\"have the look of a rock video\\" and overall suffers from needing a larger budget.

It supports general aviation with no commercial airline service scheduled. History Peronne Airport was a pre-World War II civil airport, consisting of a terminal, hangar, some support buildings and a grass airfield, serving the nearby city of Saint-Quentin. German use during World War II It was seized by the Germans in June 1940 during the early part of the Battle of France, however, the airport was not used by any Luftwaffe units for several years. Beginning in 1944, several Luftwaffe Anti- Aircraft units, Flak-Regiment 87 and Flak-Regiment 19 based their batteries of 8.8 cm (88mm) FlaK guns at the site. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 In addition, the Germans laid down two 1500m all-weather concrete runways at the airport, aligned 04/22 and 09/27. Presumably, this was due to the fortification of the Pas-de-Calais, being believed by the Germans that when the Americans and British tried to land in France to open a Second Front, the airfield would have a key role in the defense of France. Beginning in mid-June 1944, elements of the \\"Arctic Ocean (Eismeer) fighter wing\\", Jagdgeschwader 5 (JG 5) was assigned to the airfield, with Messerschmitt Bf 109G day interceptor fighters. From Peronne, JG 5 began attacking the USAAF Eighth Air Force heavy bomber fleets attacking targets in Occupied Europe and Germany. Previously not attacked by Allied bombers, the airport came under frequent attack by Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts mostly with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps when Eighth Air Force heavy bombers (B-17s, B-24s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base. The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) American use 397th Bombardment Group Martin B-26B-55-MA Marauder 42-96153 at Peronne Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) A-72, January 1945. American Ninth Army units moved through the area in early September 1944, heading towards Saint-Quentin. On 5 September The IX Engineer Command 862d Engineer Aviation Battalion moved in and began a quick rehabilitation of the base so it could be used by American aircraft. It was declared operationally ready for Ninth Air Force combat units on 6 September, only a few days after its capture from German forces, being designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"A-72 Peronne Airfield\\"IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout In addition to the airfield, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. It hosted the following known Ninth Air Force units:Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. .Johnson, David C.

Postwar/NATO use In French control after the war, the airport sat abandoned for years. There was much unexploded ordnance at the site which needed to be removed, as well as the wreckage of German and Allied aircraft. All of the buildings at the base were destroyed by the Allied air attacks or demolition, and although some had been repaired by the American combat engineers, most were in ruins. The French Air Force had no interest in the facility, and there was no money available to restore and rebuilt the prewar airport. As a result, the Air Ministry leased the land, concrete runways, structures and all, out to farmers for agricultural use, sending in unexploded ordnance teams to remove the dangerous munitions. In 1950 when as a result of the Cold War threat of the Soviet Union, the air base at Peronne was offered to the United States Air Force by the French Air Ministry as part of their NATO commitment to establish a modern Air Force Base at the site. NATO faced several problems when attempting to solve the air power survival equation. Planning for a Warsaw Pact first strike survival in both conventional and nuclear wars had to be considered. The main air bases were built on small parcels of land with very limited dispersal space. It was decided to use Peronne as an emergency \\"backup\\" airfield, known as Saint Quentin-Estres Air Base, consisting of a \\"bare bones\\" facility of a runway with minimal facilities intended for use by all NATO air forces to disperse their aircraft in case of war. Beginning about 1954, French demolition companies returned to Peronne and began demolishing the structures and removing the wreckage of the World War II air base. French Army Explosive demolition teams were brought in to safely remove unexploded ordnance remaining from the war and the site was prepared for construction. A modern all-weather concrete NATO jet runway was laid down aligned 09/27 (east-west), with taxiways and dispersal areas for three fighter squadrons. The dispersals were designed in a circular marguerite system of hardstands which could be revetted later with earth for added aircraft protection. Typically the marguerite consisted of fifteen to eighteen hardstands, with each hardstand capable of parking one or two aircraft, allowing the planes to be spaced approximately 150 feet (50 m) apart. Each squadron was assigned to a separate hangar/hardstand complex. Other than the occasional touch-and-go landing of NATO (USAF) aircraft, Peronne Air Base was never used. With the French withdrawal from the integrated military component of NATO in 1967, the base was abandoned.McAuliffe, Jerome J (2005): U.S. Air Force in France 1950-1967, Chapter 17, Dispersed Operating Bases Return to civil use With the abandonment of the facility by NATO, the airfield was acquired by the local government and redeveloped into a commercial airport. The marguerite dispersal hardstands were torn up and sold for hardcore aggregate, with a small part of the 22 end of the old wartime runway was used for a parking ramp. A new terminal was erected and also small hangar for private aircraft. Today the NATO runway and taxiway are used by the airport, however, the runway has been shortened, with about half its length as the active airport runway. The wartime 04/22 still exists in a very deteriorated condition, unused. It appears that much of the enclosing taxiway have been turned into agricultural roads. Modern skydive activity Today the skydiving dropzone of Paris is hosted here. Many skydiving clubs like Saut en Parachute Paris are using this dropzone for their activities. On a yearly basis, there are between 30.000 and 40.000 skydiving jumps, including tandem, PAC (the French AFF course) and individual solo jumps.

Hull invented a new style of \\"Free Finger\\" gloves with U-shaped rather than V-shaped tips. This new style of glove was more comfortable than traditional gloves for women with long nails. She sold the patent to the Daniel Hayes Company. In 1938, the gloves sold for between $4.50 and $6.95. According to Life magazine, Hull would earn $200,000 if a million pairs were sold. In 1939, the Lord & Taylor department store awarded Hull a $1,000 prize for her ingenuity. In 1946, Merry Hull created a \\"Turnabout Unit,\\" a set of bolero, hat, bag, and belt that could be made at home from a pattern. A response to wartime shortages, the \\"Turnabout Unit\\" allowed women to update their wardrobes with fabric they already owned. The patterns were sold for ten cents by This Week magazine. In 1948, the B. Altman department store announced a new line of clothing for young boys from Merry Hull. This new line, \\"Merry Mites,\\" included a full range of styles for toddler and preschool boys. The clothing was designed with big buttons and strategic zippers for ease of dressing. The adjustable fit allowed each item to be worn by a growing boy for up to two years. The inspiration for \\"Merry Mites\\" was Hull's own young son.

It was given its current name when Rolf Singer transferred it to Gymnopilus in 1951. Description The cap is initially convex before flattening out, reaching in diameter. It color is dull purple-red with tones ranging from bluish green to greenish yellow to olive or brown. The cap's surface texture is smooth overall except for a central fibrillose patch sometimes present in young specimens. The cap margin, initially curled inward, often becomes wavy with age. The bitter-tasting greenish-yellow flesh is thick and firm, and lacks any distinct odor. Gills have an attached to sinuate attachment to the stipe when young, which often becomes deeply emarginate (notched near the stipe) later. They are broad and closely spaced, with intervening lamellae (short gills). Initially yellowish olive, the gills become pinkish cinnamon as the spores mature. The spore print is reddish yellow. spores are thin-walled, oval with small warts on the surface, and measure 4‚Äì6 by 3.5‚Äì5 ¬µm. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.

Evangelides originally intended to become a pianist, but after designing dresses for his wife which she had made up by her dressmaker, he decided to go into fashion design. Before World War II broke out in 1939, Evangelides was a couturier in Athens for 20 years. Among his clients was the future Queen of Greece, Frederica of Hanover, who Evangelides described in 1958 as his easiest, least demanding client. Frederica patronised Evangelides between 1938 and 1945. His first New York show was held in January 1940, showing pleated gowns in blue and terracotta, with short decorative jackets and draped scarves directly referencing Greek folk costume. In 1951 Evangelides had returned to New York, where he planned to stay and establish himself as a designer, not just of couture, but of ready-to-wear for the wholesale market. Alongside his twenty years' experience in high end fashion design, he had also worked for five years as a designer for a wholesaler's in Capetown, California. In 1954 Evangelides became a designer for the custom salon at Bonwit Teller, where his dresses, presented alongside imported Paris gowns, were noted for their use of tucks and pleats. In 1958, Evangelides owned a dress shop on East 57th Street, titled \\"Yanni\\". He offered his first ready-to-wear collection in 1958.

It grows to be about 15 cm (6 in) long. The Broad-striped anchovy is found in the west Atlantic along the North American coast from Nova Scotia and the Maine coast scarcely, and abundantly from the Chesapeake bay to the West Indies and Uruguay. It is found most commonly in shoals along coastal waters, as deep as 73 m (40 fathoms) although mostly found water more shallow than this. The broad-striped anchovy spawns in spring. Their eggs are pelagic and hatch within 48 hours at regular spring temperatures. At young ages, it eats copepods, but as the fish ages, its diet begins to consist of other small crustaceans, molluscs, and worm larvae. It is an important food staple for large commercial fishes, such as the American seatrout. It is commonly eaten by birds. It is elongate with a large eye and protuberant snout, as well as a large eye, protuberant snout, large mouth and underslung jaw. Its anal fin is quite short and its front fin lies beneath the end of the dorsal fin. It is grey-green with black dots, but its notable feature is its silvery stripe from head to tail. References *J.

Early Activism Bill Dwyer was educated at Newbridge College in County Kildare. In the mid-1950s, he moved to New Zealand from Ireland. Whilst there he was introduced to anarchism by an English expat and became very active in politics. He lived in New Zealand from the mid-1950s to 1966, where he was involved in a series of legendary events. Dwyer organised no-confidence motions in the leadership of the Wellington Watersiders Union and the Victoria University Students Union. He was convicted for calling the Queen a bludger whilst speaking in Auckland in 1966.Boraman, Toby (2007) \\"Rabble rousers and merry pranksters: a history of anarchism in Aotearoa/New Zealand from the mid-1950s to the early 1980s\\" pp. 8‚Äì25 Dwyer moved to Sydney in 1966, selling cheap LSD (\\"acid\\") to finance anarchist activities. He became an exponent of psychedelic anarchism, believing acid to be a liberating substance. He engaged in soapbox oratory in the Sydney Domain and published a pamphlet that outlined his particular style of heterodox anarchism. He was sent to prison in 1968 for selling LSD, and the Australian government deported him to Ireland in 1969.Coombs, Anne (1996) \\"Sex and Anarchy: the Life and Death of the Sydney Push\\" (Viking), pp.182‚Äì186. Dwyer was said to have been asked by John Lennon to help set up a commune on an island, which may have been related to the Island Commune that Dwyer ran on Merrion Road in Dublin in 1970. Between 1970 and 1972, a commune, organised by a friend, Sid Rawle, was established on Dorinish, an island then owned by Lennon. In London Dwyer worked as a civil servant in the Stationery Office at Holborn. He was involved with the Freedom Press news group and its associated Anarchy magazine, particularly the \\"Acid Issue\\", and organised an \\"Acid Symposium\\" at Conway Hall in 1971.Bill Dwyer's 'Acid Symposium' at the Conway Hall Windsor and Free Festivals Inspired by his experiences during the \\"liberation\\" of the Isle of Wight Festival 1970, in which the fences between the paid event and free gathering outside were torn down, Dwyer developed the idea of a truly \\"free\\" festival. An acid trip in Windsor Great Park led to the notion of squatting on the former common land that had been in Crown ownership since being reserved for royal hunting by William the Conqueror, and he began to organise what was to become the People's Free Festival.Beam, Alan (1976) \\"Rehearsal for the year 2000: (drugs, religions, madness, crime, communes, love, visions, festivals and lunar energy) : the rebirth of Albion Free State (known in the Dark Ages as England) : memoirs of a male midwife (1966‚Äì1976)\\" Windsor Free Festival was the forerunner of, and inspiration for, the Free Festival Movement, particularly the Stonehenge Free Festival and the later Glastonbury Festivals. Following the violent suppression of the 1974 event, he and Sid Rawle were imprisoned to prevent the organising of a 1975 festival.Clarke, Michael (1982) \\"The Politics of Pop Festivals\\", chapter four 'The Development of Free Festivals, 1973‚Äì1976' Dwyer was imprisoned again attempting to organise another Windsor Free Festival in 1978, which did take place at Caesar's Camp nearby.Rex v Regina ‚Äì Ubi's arrest and Caesar's Camp Free Festival ‚Äì IT 1978 Later life Sometime around 1976 Dwyer returned to Ireland, where he worked as an assistant in the physiotherapy department of a Dublin hospital. He continued for some years to organise a People's Free Festival in Phoenix Park, campaigned for the legalisation of cannabis,Ubi Dwyer is organising a \\"Legalise It\\" campaign in Ireland and 1980 People's Festival in Phoenix Park ‚Äì IT 1980 and petitioned for the H-Block hunger strikers in Long Kesh prison. He stood unsuccessfully as an independent candidate for the Irish parliament in 1981 and 1982, and in local elections in D√∫n Laoghaire. Dwyer was an inveterate bicycle rider. In the early 1990s he received critical head injuries in an accident while cycling in the Dublin Mountains and never fully recovered.

(2014). &id;=159490 Aluterus schoepfii (Walbaum, 1792). In: Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. (2014) FishBase. Habitat These fish are usually found solitary or in pairs over sea bottoms with sea grass, sand, or mud. Juveniles can be found associated with floating Sargassum. Feeding Orange filefish feed on a variety of aquatic vegetation, including sea grasses and algae. Importance to humans Orange filefish are considered trash fish and rarely consumed by humans. In Brazil these fish are traded as aquarium fish. These fish contain a poison in their triggers that can be potentially threatening to humans who come in contact with them. Similar species The dotterel filefish is similar to the orange filefish, although the dotterel filefish has a longer tail fin and no orange spots along the body. The orange filefish differs from other triggerfishes by having only 2 dorsal spines.

His next stop in 1932 was the Ligue des Contributables, one of the Far right leagues that, with its anti-tax message, pre-empted the later Poujadist movement. He then became a supporter of Eug√®ne Deloncle and in 1937 joined La Cagoule. Charbonneau dropped out of politics in 1939 when he enlisted in the 1st Regiment of Zouaves. He returned to France in 1941 and joined Deloncle's Mouvement Social R√©volutionnaire and soon became a member of the Filiol tendency that turned against Deloncle in 1942. Losing interest in the group, he enlisted in Milice, which was commanded by his uncle by marriage Joseph Darnand and took over editing duties on their journal Combats. The journal appeared weekly, initially in Vichy and then in Paris.Eugen Weber, Action Fran√ßaise: Royalism and Reaction in Twentieth Century France, Stanford University Press, 1962, p. 451 Despite this Charbonneau was not overly enthusiastic about the existence of the Milice, and encouraged members to enlist in the Waffen-SS and serve on then Eastern Front.Robert Forbes, For Europe: The French Volunteers of the Waffen-SS, Helion & Company Limited, 2006, p. 187 He fled to Germany in 1944 and from his base in Berlin he served the Nazi Party as a propagandist before fleeing first to Milan and finally to Switzerland from where he was extradited to France. Charbonneau spent a while in prison for collaborationism but returned to writing upon his release, with his material featuring in a number of far right journals.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 59 In his later years he was a member of both Ordre Nouveau and Parti des forces nouvelles.

Early developments  In the early days of sail, the use of signals to communicate between ships was primitive, as seen by one admiral's instructions to his fleet in 1530: > \\"Whensoever, and at all tymes the Admyrall doth shote of a pece of Ordnance, > and set up his Banner of Council on Starrborde bottocke of his Shippe, > everie shipps capten shall with spede go aborde the Admyrall to know his > will.\\", p.77, quoting from W. G. Perrin, \\"British flags\\" (Cambridge, 1922). By 1653, the Royal Navy had issued instructions by which an admiral could signal various orders by hoisting flags in various locations on his ship. Modern naval code signalling began with the invention of maritime signal flags in the mid-17th century by the then-Duke of York (subsequently James II)Pelham Brenton, Edward, Cptn., The naval history of Great Britain: from the year MDCCLXXXIII to MDCCCXXII., Vol. III, C. Rice, Berkeley Square, London, 1824, p.163 who was created Lord High Admiral after the Restoration. A ship's message had to be approved by the officer of the watch, and his system was augmented and changed in various ways over the following century. In 1790, Admiral Lord Howe issued a new signal book for a numerary system, using numeral flags to signal a number; the number indicated the message, not the mast from which the flags flew. Substitute flags were also instituted to indicate repeated numerals, and there was consideration of making the flags more distinct. French developments A numerical flag code using ten coloured flags was proposed by Bertrand-Fran√ßois Mah√© de La Bourdonnais in 1738. Bourdonnais proposed hoisting the flags in groups of three, making a thousand possible messages that could be transmitted by reference to a code book. His idea was not taken up at the time, but it was noticed by Ignace Chappe, the brother of Claude Chappe. The Chappes developed an optical land telegraph which used a numerical code book with many thousands of messages.. In 1763, Sebastian Francisco de Bigot, the founder of the Acad√©mie de Marine in Brest, published Tactique Navale ou Traite des Evolutions et des Signaux. This was the first established system for coded flags with a defined protocol for using them. The code had 336 possible signals. De Bigot's book was published in England in 1767, but it was several decades before the Royal Navy developed their own system..  Popham's flag code, \\"Telegraphic Signals of Marine Vocabulary\\" In 1799, Captain Sir Home Popham published his first list of words and sentences which could be referenced by a number (or \\"code\\"); three subsequent editions added letter flags, with the 1801 edition numbering 2994 codes., pp.79-81.Popham, Home, Sir, Telegraphic signals; or marine vocabulary 1801, C. Roworth Printer, Bell Yard, Temple Bar, (Transcribed by Peter Ball, January 2006), from signal book at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, UK It was based on the signal books created earlier by Admiral Lord Howe. Popham's code assigned the digits 0 to 9 to ten signal flags, which were used in combination. Code numbers 1‚Äì25 represented letters of the alphabet (omitting J and with V=20 before U=21); higher numbers were assigned meanings by a code book. The code numbers typically would have been hoisted on the mizzenmast, one after another, preceded by the \\"telegraphic flag\\" (a red over white diagonally-split flag)A Brief Interlude 2: Signal Flags (showing the \\"telegraphic flag\\" and \\"end of code\\" flag) at mymodelsailingships.blogspot.co.uk Accessed 22 October 2017 to show that the subsequent signals would employ the Popham code. As well as digit flags, the code used \\"repeat\\" flags so that only one set of digits was needed; thus the word do, coded as \\"220\\", used a \\"2\\" flag, a \\"first repeat\\" flag here serving as a second 2, and a \\"0\\" flag. The end of the message would be indicated by an \\"end of code\\" flag (blue over yellow diagonally split). Popham's code was famously used for the \\"England expects that every man will do his duty\\" signal at Trafalgar by Nelson: for this, a team of four to six men would have prepared and hoisted the flags onboard Lord Nelson's flagship , the whole process taking about 4 minutes. The message shows one of the shortcomings of Popham's code‚Äîeven the two-letter \\"do\\" required three flags hoisted for the signal.  Marryat's Code of Signals  Marryat's flags.The \\"1\\" (one) flag is shown with reversed colors elsewhere on the Internet. The form shown here - white on a field of blue - is correct as confirmed by reference to , , and . Previous systems were primarily naval. The first general system of signalling for merchant vessels was Captain Frederick Marryat's A Code of Signals for the Merchant Service published in 1817. This consisted of six parts of large numbered lists: # A list of English Men of War. # A list of foreign Men of War. # A list of the English Merchant Vessels (from Lloyd's List). # A list of Lighthouses, Ports, Headlands, Rocks, Shoals, Reefs &c. # A selection of Sentences. # The Vocabulary. Different flags indicated which list was referred to. As an example, flying the Rendezvous (RE) flag (indicating Lighthouses, Ports, etc.) over the numerals 1537 indicates that the ship's home port is Amsterdam. Flying Rendezvous under the number indicated that the ship is sailing from Amsterdam, and flying it at some other mast-head indicates that she is bound for that port. Numbers alone indicate a sentence: \\"4576\\" means \\"I mean to keep sail set, and carry on all night, as I am anxious to get into port.\\" Marryat's code was an immediate success and was translated into several other languages, and the 1854 edition was renamed The Universal Code of Signals for the Mercantile Marine of All Nations because of its widespread usage.; . The last edition was published in 1879, two decades after the publication of the code that supplanted it; there are reports that it was still being used as late as 1890., excerpted at Archives & Collections Society.  International Code of Signals  Various other codes were also published,. but all these were eventually supplanted by the Commercial Code of Signals published by the British Board of Trade in 1857, which eventually became the International Code of Signals (ICS). A significant development was the addition of letter flags to make the code alphabetical. (The vowels were initially left out to avoid formation of any objectionable words.) , pp.83-84; see also Hulme, Flags of the World (1898), excerpted at Archives & Collections Society. During World War I, there was an unprecedented need for ships to communicate, merchant as well as naval, but the ICS was found wanting: \\"It was not international. It was found that when [signalling] word by word, the occasions upon which signaling failed were more numerous than when the result was successful.\\", preface. This led to major revisions in 1931. This new international code of signals was officially brought into force worldwide on 1 January 1934. Thirteen new flags were introduced, so that the triangular pennants used for letters, C, D, E, F, and G were replaced with new square flags and became the numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The numerals 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0 were introduced by five new flags, and there were three substitute flags, used when repeating letters in a hoist. Additional changes in 1969 greatly reduced the Code (dropping the Geographical and Vocabulary sections), and more narrowly focused it on communications related to safety of navigation.. An indication of the success of the ICS is that most navies now use the ICS flags for representing letters.

It operates Palomar Medical Center in Escondido (opened 2012), Pomerado Hospital in Poway, and many other locations. Covering , Palomar Health is California's largest health care district by area. The district was formed in 1984, replacing the Escondido Valley Hospital Association which itself was formed in 1945. Governance Each California health care district is governed by a locally elected board of directors. Candidates are elected to the board of directors for four-year terms. For example, an election for 3 out of the 7 directors took place during the November 2012 California elections. History The origins of Palomar Health can be traced back to two benevolent German women, Charlotta Baker Hintz, a nurse, and Elizabeth Martin, a dietician, who left their jobs at the Anaheim Sanitarium in 1933, to establish a hospital to serve the small farming community of Escondido. Using their own money, the women bought an egg and poultry plant at 125 South Broadway and converted it into a 13-bed hospital. In 1945, the Escondido Valley Hospital Association was formed to investigate the possibility of building a larger facility to keep pace with growth. The Escondido Valley Hospital Association established the Northern San Diego County Hospital District in 1948 and the vision of the new, larger facility in downtown Escondido was achieved in 1950. Palomar Memorial Hospital, named in tribute to the men and women who served in World War II, was dedicated on February 16, 1950. In 1970, the McLeod Tower was added to Palomar Memorial Hospital to help meet the needs of the growing community. After receiving full designation as a trauma center in 1987, the hospital was renamed Palomar Medical Center. The Northern San Diego County Hospital District supervised the construction of a sister facility in Poway, Pomerado Hospital in 1977. As that community grew, several expansions were made to Pomerado Hospital. Palomar Health added a third hospital to the system in 2012 with the opening of the new Palomar Medical Center in west Escondido. The original hospital in downtown Escondido was renamed Palomar Health Downtown Campus. To more accurately reflect the region it served, the Northern San Diego County Hospital District was renamed Palomar Pomerado Hospital District in 1984. Five years later, the name was changed to Palomar Pomerado Health System and was then shortened to Palomar Pomerado Health in 2001. In 2012 the District‚Äôs name was simplified to Palomar Health. Today Palomar Health is the largest health care district serving communities in an 850-square-mile area and a trauma center that covers more than 2,200 square miles of South Riverside and North San Diego Counties. In addition to three hospitals, Palomar Health offers home health care, surgery, skilled nursing, ambulatory care, behavioral health services, wound care, and community health education programs.

Fossils have been found in Algeria dating from 50 to 46 million years ago. It was once commonly thought to be one of the oldest simian primates (a group that includes monkeys and apes), and was crucial to the hypothesis that simians originated in Africa. Research on more complete specimens suggest it was instead a strepsirrhine primate, more closely related to living lemurs and lorisoids. However, this is still disputed. Discovery Fragmentary fossils were first found in the Glib Formation at the Glib Zegdou locality in Algeria and dated to the Early to Middle Eocene, 50 to 46 million years ago. The holotype was an upper left molar (M2). Evolutionary history and taxonomy First described in the journal Nature by Marc Godinot and Mohamed Mahboubi in 1992, Algeripithecus was once widely considered one of the oldest known fossil simian primates, giving weight to the African origins hypothesis for simians. It was originally interpreted as a propliopithecid, but was also seen as a proteopithecid by Godinot in 1994 and as a parapithecoid by Seiffert et al. starting in 2005. Based on the discovery of additional fossil teeth and a maxilla (upper jaw) between 2003 and 2009, Tabuce et al. reconstructed Algeripithecus as an azibiid, a group thought to be a type of stem lemuriform, or strepsirrhine primate. According to Tabuce et al., the mandible of Algeripithecus indicates it had an inclined canine tooth, similar to that found in toothcombed primates. Although the anterior dentition of azibiids is unknown, they may have possessed a toothcomb, indicating an ancient stem lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa, possibly descended from an early Asian branch of adapiforms such as a primitive branch of cercamoniines predating Donrussellia (one of the oldest European adapiforms). As a result, the African origins of crown strepsirhines (including lemurs and lorisoids) is well supported, whereas the African origins of simians has been placed in doubt, possibly giving favor to an Asian origins hypothesis. However, in 2010, Godinot reasserted his view that Algeripithecus was a simian based on its upper molar morphology and hypothesized that this applied to all azibiids, favoring his earlier view that azibiids may be early simians instead of stem lemuriforms. In 2011, Marivaux et al. published an interpretation of recently discovered talus bones of closely related Azibius found at Gour Lazib, which they claimed were more similar to those of living strepsirrhines and extinct adapiforms, not simians, thus reinforcing the strepsirrhine status favored by Tabuce et al. two years earlier. Godinot also cautiously suggested that Dralestes may be a synonym of Algeripithecus based on a blade-like premolar. Alternatively, the second upper molar (M2) of Dralestes hammadaensis have been reinterpreted by Tabuce et al. as being the upper fourth premolar (P4) of Azibius, and therefore considered Dralestes to be a synonym of Azibius. Specimens of Dralestes are now recognized as being either Azibius and Algeripithecus. Anatomy and physiology Like all azibiids, Algeripithecus was a small-bodied primate. Initially thought to weigh , Algeripithecus minutus is now estimated to have weighed between , nearly half the weight of the only other known azibiid, Azibius trerki. It was comparable in size to a hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis) or a brown mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus).

Gardner was described as \\"slight of build and dark-complexioned\\" in appearance. Life as a gunfighter The family migrated to Texas after the Civil War. Gardner married and fathered five children, being a farmer. He then learned he had Bright's disease and would often boast, \\"If I've got to cash in I might as well take along some of my enemies\\". Gardner's reputation as a gunman led to the killings of \\"two white men and several Negroes\\", according to William Z. Foster. Notoriety Gardner hired out his skills with a gun to the Southern Pacific railroad in the winter of 1901 in Eastern Texas, which was described as \\"tough country\\" where holdups were frequent. It was in the town of Echo, Texas near Beaumont where Foster noted Gardner's reputation as a gunman. He described Gardner as the \\"most hard-boiled boss\\" and that \\"gun in hand, he terrorized the Mexican laborers\\". The last note that Foster made concerning Gardner was after the gunfighter had pistol whipped a cook for insulting his complexion. Lige Gardner most likely died from his illness in later years.

Established in 1967 and expanded several times in its history, the mall's anchor stores are Kohl's, Planet Fitness, and H&M; with more than ninety inline tenants and a food court. There are 3 vacant anchor stores that were once Macy's, Bergner's, and Sears. The mall is owned and managed by CBL & Associates Properties. History Eastland Mall opened on February 16, 1967, anchored by JCPenney and Sears, both of which had moved from downtown Bloomington. The mall was built on the east side of town, at the southwestern corner of East Empire Street (Illinois Route 9) and Veterans Parkway (formerly U.S. Route 66, now Interstate 55 Business Loop). At the time, this intersection had only a gas station, although a Kmart store was also under development at the time. Eastland Mall housed many local and national tenants including Woolworth, Kirlin's Hallmark Gold Crown and a Walgreens drugstore, which relocated outside the mall in 1991. Besides the two anchors, several of the mall's tenants had moved from downtown, including Singer Sewing Center and Chadband's Diamond and Gold Center; the latter had been in business since 1892. Other major tenants included a grocery store and movie theater. The mall was expanded several times in its history, first with a Bergner's department store in 1973, the first new department store to open in the city in more than thirty years. Kohl's was added a decade later. A food court was added in 1989 followed by a mall-wide renovation a year later, Sears expanded its store in 1997, and a Famous-Barr was added in November 1999, which became Macy's in 2006.

The mall's first stage, comprising a Carson Pirie Scott department store and other mall shops, opened on August 14, 1980, followed by a Montgomery Ward anchor on September 25. Two years later, Target was added as a third anchor. MetLife bought the mall in 1986 for $21 million. In 1988, Carson Pirie Scott sold its store to Von Maur. Montgomery Ward closed its store in 1997 and was replaced with a Hobby Lobby crafts store in 1999. Also in 1997, Stein Mart added its first central Illinois location to the middle of the mall, while MC Sports moved to Eastland. Over time, many other stores relocated to the larger mall as well, leaving College Hills without most of its major chain stores. In addition, Stein Mart closed in October 2000. By June 2004, the only tenants remaining at the mall were the three anchor stores and a Diamond Dave's Mexican restaurant. After its closure, the entire mall building was demolished except for Hobby Lobby, Target and Von Maur. Cullinan Properties then redeveloped the property as an outdoor mall, with Gordmans being added as a fourth anchor. The new center officially opened in August 2005. The shopping center was purchased in January 2017 by Alto Real Estate funds and M & J Wilkow. In April 2017 it was announced that Gordmans was going to be closing which closed sometime in 2017. In January 2018 it was announced that Hobby Lobby would move into the vacant Gordmans space which opened on June 25, 2018. On August 21, 2018 it was announced that Comcast will open a new store at the shopping center in winter 2018 or early winter 2019.

Life and work Cunill Cabanellas was born in Barcelona, Spain, in 1894. His father, Juan Cunill, had been a well-known actor on the Catalan stage. He emigrated to Buenos Aires in 1915 and quickly gained prominence in the vibrant local theatre scene, and became an early cinematographer and actor in the Argentine cinema, appearing in a 1917 comedy, Carlitos en Mar del Plata.Teatro en la Argentina: Gesti√≥n de Antonio Cunill Cabanellas He worked afterwards as an assistant director, mostly on zarzuelas and sainetes - comedy genres popular at the time in much of the Spanish- speaking world. He began writing, as well, and produced numerous of his own plays, notably Chaco, for which he won a Florencio S√°nchez Prize in 1933. The establishment that year of the National Comedy at the newly nationalized Cervantes Theatre led to Cunill's appointment as its director, and he inaugurated the new institution in 1935. His first production was of local playwright Gregorio de Laferr√®re's Locos de verano (Summer Madness), which debuted to acclaim on April 24, 1936;Teatro Cervantes: Historia he later adapted the play for the local cinema in 1942. Cunill helped remedy the local shortage of skilled technicians in scenography and stagecraft by founding the National Institute for Theatrical Studies and authoring a number of technical texts and treatises. He also became Argentina's first vigorous promoter of local playwrights during his tenure at the National Comedy, and of 27 plays in its repertoire over five years, 26 were Argentine. The 1941 appointment of the ultra-conservative Director of the National Library of Argentina, Gustavo Mart√≠nez Zuvir√≠a, as head of the National Commission for Culture led to Cunill's resignation, however. He continued to be prolific as director on the local stage, producing a number of Leopoldo Marechal's works, notably La Tres Caras de Venus (Three Faces of Venus) in 1951, his own, notably Fin de semana (Weekend), in 1949, and William Shakespeare's (Midsummer Night's Dream, 1953). A number of the lead actors he discovered during this era, such as Eva Franco, Duilio Marzio and Pepe Soriano, later became prominent in both Argentine theatre and film.La Capital: Eva Franco, siempre en el recuerdo Clar√≠n: Duilio Marzio Pepe Soriano: Una noche de verano Becoming assistant director of the National Music Conservatory, Cunill was named director of the largest popular stage theatre in Argentina, the public Teatro General San Mart√≠n, in 1953, and managed the institution during a difficult interim marked by a scarcity of venues (its new, modernist Corrientes Avenue building was under construction) and the instability leading to President Juan Per√≥n's 1955 overthrow. Cunill resigned on the eve of these events, and he returned at the helm of his National Institute for Theatrical Studies, teaching at its facilities adjoining the Cervantes Theatre until his death in 1969 at age 74.

Dumaresq was born in Swansea, Glamorgan, Wales, the youngest son of Colonel John Dumaresq and was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He accepted a cadetship after three years study in the East India Company. Dumaresq became a lieutenant in the Bombay Native Infantry, also working in the Revenue and Topographical Survey Department of Gujarat. Granted sick leave in 1823, he spent some time recuperating in Mauritius, then journeyed to Hobart and Sydney. He briefly returned to England after being deemed unfit for tropical duty, but was soon travelling again to Hobart. Dumaresq's sister had married Ralph Darling, who in 1824, had been appointed Governor of New South Wales. Darling, his wife and Dumaresq (along with Dumaresq's brothers William John and Henry) sailed in the Catherine Stewart Forbes and arrived in Hobart in October 1825. Lieutenant-Governor Sir George Arthur had made Dumaresq Surveyor General of Van Diemen's Land in 1825, although this appointment was not ratified by the British government. Dumaresq held the office until replaced by George Frankland in March 1828, and then became collector of revenue and joined the Land Board. Soon afterwards Dumaresq was appointed police magistrate at New Norfolk. Dumaresq was appointed Commissioner of Court of Requests, Van Diemens' Land on 24 December 1830 and held the post until 1835. Dumaresq 's health suffered and he obtained leave in February 1835 to travel to New South Wales for recuperation. There he took medical advice and went on the land. He became a landowner and speculated in property, gaining profits in deals in Victoria and Brisbane. Dumaresq bought land in Sackville Ward, Kew, Victoria, bordered by Cotham and Burke Roads, naming streets in the area after family members (John, Alfred, Edward, Rowland, and Thomas Streets). Dumaresq took his family on holiday to England in 1853, mainly spending time at Malvern Wells in Worcestershire. Dumaresq's wife, Frances Blanche nee Legge died at this time. Dumaresq returned to Australia and committed what he termed 'the fatal act of a second marriage' to Mrs Charlotte Fogg ‚Äî the marriage only lasting a few months. Dumaresq unsuccessfully stood in 1861 as a candidate for Devon in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. Dumaresq died at Illawarra, Longford, Tasmania, on 23 April 1906 aged 103, reputedly the oldest justice of the peace in the world.

It features music composed by Matt Uelmen for the game. It was released on June 30, 2000 as part of the Diablo II Collector's Edition, and later on iTunes. Recording The score was composed by Matt Uelmen and integrates creepy ambience with melodic pieces. The style of the score is ambient industrial and experimental. Some tracks were created by reusing the tracks from Diablo, while others by rearranging tracks that were out-takes. Other scores are combinations of parts that were created more than a year after the first game's release. A single track usually integrates recorded samples from sound libraries, live recorded instrument interpretation samples specially meant for the game (guitar, flute, oriental percussion), and electronic instruments also, making the tracks difficult for later live interpretations. While the player visits the town, the game recreates the peaceful atmosphere from the first Diablo game, so for that the theme from Act I called \\"Rogue\\" comes back with the same chords of the original piece, reproducing only a part of the original Diablo town theme. For Act II Mustafa Waiz, a percussionist, and Scott Petersen, the game's sound designer, worked on the drum samples. Waiz played on the dumbek, djembe, and finger cymbals which gave Matt Uelmen a base upon which to build tracks around. The town theme from Act II, \\"Toru\\", makes strong statement of departure from the world of Act I while also maintaining a thematic connection to what had come before. It is the first time in the series to be used some radically different elements than the guitars and choral sounds that dominate both the original Diablo and the opening quarter of Diablo II. The foundation of the \\"Toru\\" piece is found in exciting dynamics of a Chinese wind gong. The instrument radically changes color from a steady mysterious drone to a harsh, fearsome noise, that gives exotic feeling and at the same time the pacing of the second town. In all sequences of Act II with deserts and valleys, Arabic percussion sounds dominate. The composer was impressed by two of the Spectrasonics music libraries, Symphony of Voices and Heart of Asia. He used samples from Heart of Asia in the Harem piece from Act II. The \\"Crypt\\" track uses a sample from Symphony of Voices; the choral phrase Miserere. The piece \\"Coda\\" samples from Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Prelude in C Minor, opus 28, no. 20. Reception In 2001, Uelmen, who composed the soundtrack, and cinematic soundtrack composers Jason Hayes, Glenn Stafford and Andrea Pessino won the International Game Developers Association award for Excellence in Audio for their work on Diablo II. Different Versions The original soundtrack, which can be extracted from the game files, comprises over twenty songs totaling more than two hours in length. Because of space constraints, some songs on the CD release were edited to reduce their length, while others were left out entirely. For example, \\"Rogue\\" is a reduced-length version of the Rogue Encampment theme, and the Tristram theme was not included. A full length collection of music from Diablo II and Diablo II: Lord of Destruction was posted to the official fansite, but has since been removed.

She was an American playwright, poet and political activist. She became distinguished after the American Revolutionary War, in New York City's fashionable society, as a gifted and accomplished woman, although her married life was rendered unhappy by a profligate husband. After his death in 1798, she assisted in a female academy in New Brunswick; but her sufferings were said to have \\"broken her heart\\". She died at the early age of twenty-nine. Early life and education Margaretta V. Bleecker was born in New York City to John and Ann Eliza Bleecker, members of the American Dutch aristocracy. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to their country estate in Tomhannock, a small village north of Albany, where they lived in the \\"most perfect tranquility\\" until the outbreak of the American Revolution. Her mother was a prolific writer and had encouraged her to write as well. During the war Margaretta lost her grandmother, her aunt and her sister. Her mother was devastated by the loss and never fully recovered. Margaretta described their life after the war as \\"tolerable tranquility\\". Her mother developed a tendency towards depression and destroyed most of her own writings. Margaretta's tragedy continued with the loss of her mother when she was twelve years old. Sometime after her mother's death, she and her father moved to New York City where she continued her education and began to write. Career Faug√®res was committed to establishing her mother's reputation as a writer as well as her own. She started publishing her mother's poetry, what was left of it, in The New York Magazine in 1790. Similarly she began publishing her own essays and poems in the same periodical. Her reputation as a poet grew and for a few years she was considered the \\"premier poet\\" of the magazine. She had strong political views and concentrated her writings around the anti-slavery movement, her support of the French Revolution and her disapproval of capital punishment. In June 1791, The New York Magazine published Faug√®res essay Fine Feelings Exemplified in the Conduct of a Negro Slave in which she challenged Thomas Jefferson's claim that slaves lacked \\"finer feelings\\", she wrote, > I cannot help thinking that their sensations, mental and external, are as > acute as those of the people whose skin may be of a different colour; such > an assertion may be bold, but facts are stubborn things, and had I not them > to support me, it is probable I should not attempt to oppose the opinions of > such an eminent reasoner. Her support of the French Revolution was probably shaped by her friendship with a French physician, Peter Faugeres, who shared her political views. They were married, in opposition to her father's wishes, on Bastille Day, July 14, 1792. Her marriage proved to be miserable; it became widely known that her husband abused her and within just a few years managed to squander her large fortune. In 1793, she published The Posthumous Works of Ann Eliza Bleecker in Prose and Verse, to which is added a Collection of Essays, Prose and Poetical, a collection of her mother's work and her own. In 1795, she wrote Belisarius: A Tragedy. It was her major literary achievement, a blank-verse tragedy in four acts which echoed her views on human rights. Faugeres opposed the death penalty for murder which made her view more radical than most. She felt it was inconsistent for a country which boasted of its freedom and happiness. She wrote The Ghost of John Young in 1797. It was a six-page pamphlet arguing against the use of capital punishment. It was a poetic narrative in which she gave John Young's perspective from the grave. > Yes, I a murderer was by rage propell'd; and I have heard the last harsh > decree, > but if the maniac is a murderer held, say cool deliberate actors, what are > ye? Not much is known of the remainder of her life. Her husband died of yellow fever in 1798. She taught school at an academy in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and later in Brooklyn. Her last published work, \\"Ode\\", was composed to support a July 4, 1798, speech given by Governor George Clinton, of whom she was a longtime supporter. The text was written to remind those of the price of revolution and the need for change. Faugeres saw beyond her privileged class and wrote about the democratic ideals of equality and justice. She sought radical change for American society and politics. Personal life Margaretta Van Wyck Bleecker and Peter Faugeres had two daughters, Eveanna Electa Faugeres (1795‚Äì1841) and Margaret Mason Faugeres (1797‚Äì1820). Eveanna married John Anthony Bleecker (her cousin) and had 8 children. Margaret married Edward P. Brady and was married 5 years before her death. She died on January 9, 1801, in Brooklyn and is buried next to her father in the Bowery Methodist Church cemetery.

The term tamper proof is sometimes used but is considered a misnomer given that pilfering is still technically possible A security band can be integral with the cap or can be a separate package component. It is a plastic or metal structure around the circumference (usually) of the closure that is often found attached below a closure in bottles, jars, and tubs. Several variations have been developed for caps, lids, and closures. The use of custom printing and security printing is available. Perforations or other areas of weakness are often used to initiate and control a tear. Sometimes engineered frangibility is used for break-away functions. While tamper-evident bands are not considered a challenge for recycling, it is important that the band stays attached to the cap in case of refillable bottles, because it is hard to remove the rings from intact bottles in an economical way. The opening ring is a tamper warning: if the seal between the ring and the cap is broken, it is an indication that the cap has been opened. Purposes Security opening rings might have several possible purposes: *Provide clear evidence of container being opened *Deter tampering *Deter package pilferage *Deter product adulteration *Improved closure strength during shipping *Regulatory requirement (sometimes) Roll-on metal closures When an aluminum or plastic bottle cap has an integral band, it is usually connected by thin bridges. They can be molded along with the cap or slit afterwards. When unscrewing the cap, the frangible ring breaks: the ring can separate from the cap, and two separate pieces remain, the sealing piece and the leftover ring; or the broken ring can form a \\"pigtail\\" still attached to the cap. Shrink bands Separate bands of shrink film can be placed over the closure and tightened in a shrink tunnel. Some have perforations or nicks to help initiate the tear. Other Most standard pressure sensitive tapes do not have a high degree of tamper evidence. Some special security tapes have additional tamper evident features which offer better tamper evidence. Some have intentional weakness which cause breakage or delamination; others have hidden messages which appear upon opening.

Located 40 miles north of San Diego, Tri-City serves three major cities in the North County section of San Diego County: Oceanside, Vista, and Carlsbad. The hospital also owns and operates nearby outpatient services, as well as the Tri-City Health and Wellness Complex in Carlsbad, home to the Tri-City Wellness Center, a 58,000-square-foot medically integrated training facility. TCMC is administered by the Tri-City Healthcare District, a Health District of California. History The Tri-City Medical Center was founded in 1961 after voters elected to form the Tri-City Hospital District, approving a bond issue to pay for the cost of land and construction. At the time, northern San Diego County was a rural area with little medical infrastructure, and community leaders from Carlsbad, Oceanside, and Vista knew the region needed a modern local hospital in order to grow. The finished product, originally named the Tri-City Hospital, was the outcome of their labor. When Tri-City Medical Center first opened, it was a relatively small facility, with only 42 physicians on staff; as North County's population continued to grow, it quickly became apparent that the hospital would need to expand. In the 1970s, responding to demand, Tri-City added a cardiopulmonary lab, additional surgical suites, and a 42-bed maternity unit. In the 1980s, the hospital expanded further, adding a four-story wing and remodeling existing facilities. It also increased its range of services, creating a mental health unit and a dialysis center, and began providing cardiac rehabilitation. By the time Tri- City Hospital changed its name to Tri-City Medical Center in 1985, the hospital had also developed a magnetic resonance imaging center, a neonatal intensive care unit, and an updated emergency department. Medical Specialties As a full-service public hospital, Tri-City Medical Center provides a wide range of healthcare services, including behavioral health services, home health care, and rehabilitation services. The following services, however, are considered to be its medical specialties: * Cancer: Accredited by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer, Tri- City's cancer service provides chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immune or targeted therapy, and radiation therapy treatment. In 2016, Tri-City Medical Center became one of the first hospitals in San Diego County to offer intraoperative radiation therapy for patients with early-stage breast cancer. * Emergency Services: The TCMC Emergency Department contains a San Diego County designated Heart Attack Receiving Center, as well a Joint Commission designated Primary Stroke Receiving Center. The department provides 41 beds for critical injuries and illnesses, as well as six beds for less severe illnesses and injuries. * Heart Care: Tri-City Medical Center's Cardiovascular Health Institute provides cardiothoracic surgery, interventional radiology, and vascular surgery, among other cardiological services. The recipient of the Joint Commission's Gold Seal of Approval for Primary Stroke Centers, the Institute also became, in 2009, the first nationally accredited Chest Pain Center in San Diego County. * NICU: Tri-City Medical Center has the second largest neonatal intensive care unit in San Diego County (second only to Rady Children's Hospital), and is the only Level III NICU located in North County San Diego. * Orthopedics: TCMC's Orthopaedic and Spine Institute performs hip, knee, and shoulder replacements, as well as laminectomies and spinal fusions, among other orthopaedic procedures. In July 2012, Tri-City became the first hospital in San Diego County to perform a Vitamin E Total Knee Replacement. * Robotic Surgery: Tri-City uses robotic systems to perform a number of surgical procedures, and is the only hospital in San Diego County with more than one such system: the hospital implements the Da Vinci Surgical System to perform select procedures in general surgery, gynecology, heart care, orthopaedics, and urology; the Mazor Robotic Renaissance System to perform select spinal surgeries; the Navio Surgical System to perform partial knee replacements. * Women's Care: Tri-City offers pregnancy support through a childbirth center, programs and classes. The hospital also provides women's health services including mammogram screenings. Research Tri-City Medical Center performs more than 20 clinical research studies a year, often in close affiliation with the University of California, San Diego medical staff. TCMC also conducts research in partnership with independent physicians and practices, regional pediatric care facilities, primary care facilities, and outpatient treatment satellites. The hospital's research currently focuses in the following areas: breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, cellulitis, endocrinology, hematology / oncology, hepatology; infection, mental health, pneumonia, and stroke. Facilities and Current Operations Tri-City Medical Center's main campus is located at 4002 Vista Way in Oceanside, California. Its fitness complex, better known as Tri-City Wellness Center is located at 6250 El Camino Real in Carlsbad. The 58,000 square foot facility is an integrated wellness campus that sets the stage for an environment focused on total well-being, ranging from day-to-day health maintenance to sports performance training and rehabilitation. Currently, two service lines, Physical Therapy and Cardiac Rehabilitation operate within the facility. Adjacent to Tri-City Wellness Center, located at 6260 El Camino Real, is the award-winning Center for Wound Care & Hyperbaric Medicine. Together, the hospital system has a partnership with more than 700 physicians and handles nearly 200,000 outpatient visitors a year, about 17,000 of whom are admitted. The hospital's 388 licensed beds are utilized to a wide variety of ends. Tri-City treats around 92,000 patients a year on an outpatient basis and over 70,000 patients a year through its 24-hour Emergency Department. Tri-City also delivers nearly 2,600 babies a year. TCMC has been expanding its facilities in order to increase its range of services. In recent years, Tri-City has built the Orthopaedic and Spine Institute (2011), the Cardiovascular Health Institute (2010), the Tri-City Medical Office Building in Carlsbad (2010), the Tri-City Wellness Center (2009), and the Center for Wound Care and Hyperbaric Medicine (2008). UC San Diego Health and Tri-City Healthcare District finalized in August 2016 an agreement between the two organizations, entering into an affiliation designed to provide expanded health care to patients in North San Diego County. Community Involvement Tri-City Medical Center sponsors the annual Carlsbad Marathon & Half Marathon. In 2016, this event featured nearly 7,000 participants from 47 states and 30 countries. In 2016, Tri-City Medical Center announced a three-year partnership with the American Heart Association to sponsor an annual heart walk in Oceanside, California, starting in September 2017.

It is an updated version of Street Fighter IV and has been said to mark the definitive end of the Street Fighter IV series. Having been deemed as too large an update to be deployed as DLC, the game was made into a standalone title but given a lower price than that of a full retail game. It was released in April 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition was released as one of the launch titles for the Nintendo 3DS, with 3D functionality, on February 26, 2011, in Japan. The game has sold 1.9 million units worldwide, while the 3D Edition for the 3DS has sold an additional 1.1 million units worldwide. Gameplay Makoto, performing her Fukiage on Dan Hibiki. Much like Street Fighter IV, Super Street Fighter IV features 3D backgrounds and characters played on a 2D plane. Exclusive additions like Focus- Attacks and separate meters for both Super and Ultra Combos make a return. The Ultra Combo gauge and moves has been left unchanged since Street Fighter IV. All characters feature at least two Ultra Combos. However, only one Ultra can be selected at a time in a way similar to the Super Arts system in the Street Fighter III series. To Use a Super Combo or an Ultra Combo, the respective meters have to be full. The Ultra combo meter charges up when the player gets hit and so it can also be called a Revenge Meter. The Ultra Combo meter is the one right next to the Super Combo meter. The goal is to exhaust the opponent's health meter before the time runs out. The player wins a round if they deplete their opponent's health meter, or have more health than their opponent when time runs out. If both players deplete their meters at the same time or contain the same amount when the round timer ends, it will result in either a \\"Double KO\\" or a draw giving both players a round win. If there isn't a clear winner by the final match, it will result in a \\"draw game\\" (during online play, both players will lose battle points, and player points, in the result of a draw game). Similar to past entries, Super Street Fighter IV is played using an eight-way directional system giving players the ability to jump, crouch, and move towards and away from opponents. Generally, there are six attack buttons for both punch and kick commands with three of each type, differing in strength and speed. Similar to the latter two games from the Street Fighter III series, grabs are performed by pressing both light attacks, while taunts are performed by pressing both heavy attacks simultaneously. When playing through the single-player mode, if toggled on, there are additional bonus stages allowing a chance to receive additional points, similar to the ones found in Street Fighter II. The first challenge involves destroying a car while the second has players break as many barrels as they can. Super Street Fighter IV features modes from the original game including \\"Arcade\\", \\"Versus\\", \\"Training\\", and \\"Trials\\". The game features a few additional online modes apart from Ranked battles. \\"Team Battle\\" can have up to 4 players per team to battle against another group. \\"Endless Battle\\" has the winner playing against a rotating group of up to 8 players. To replace Street Fighter IV's \\"Championship Mode\\", \\"Tournament\\" allows players compete in a small single elimination bracket. \\"Replay Channel\\" allows players to view and save replays from various matches around the world. Characters \\"Super Street Fighter IV\\" includes all the original 25 World Warriors from the home version of \\"Street Fighter IV\\", as well as 10 new fighters, all of which are unlocked at the start of the game; this means that there a total of 35 characters in \\"Super Street Fighter IV\\". Each returning character received a new intro and ending in arcade mode. Among the added World Warriors are Dee Jay and T. Hawk from Super Street Fighter II, who were initially intended for the original Street Fighter IV but later dropped. Adon from the original Street Fighter and Cody and Guy from Final Fight are available, based on their incarnations in the Street Fighter Alpha series. Additionally, Dudley, Ibuki, and Makoto return from the Street Fighter III series. The game also introduced two all- new fighters. One of them is Juri, a young South Korean female Taekwondo fighter, who works for Seth's organization, the Shadaloo Intimidation Network (S.I.N.). Juri has an energy-boosting device implanted inside her left eye called the \\"Feng Shui Engine\\", which provides her with time-warping abilities. The second fighter, Hakan, is a Turkish oil wrestler who seeks to prove that Turkish oil wrestling is the greatest fighting style on Earth.Honda rival battle dialog Each returning character from the original version of Street Fighter IV features an additional third costume, whereas newly introduced characters have only 2 available. Old costumes from the original Street Fighter IV can be used after purchasing downloadable costume packs from Xbox Live or PlayStation Network. These costumes are automatically loaded in Super Street Fighter IV. Development Capcom officially hinted at the game in early September 2009 when they opened a teaser site in their official Japanese website. An official announcement was made on September 28, 2009, for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, with an arcade version initially only considered a possibility depending on fan support. In 2010 Yoshinori Ono said: > \\"I have no intention of carrying on Street Fighter IV into Hyper Street > Fighter IV or Ultra Street Fighter IV, because I'm aware of the mistakes > Capcom has made in the past. So whether it would be a different IP or > another Street Fighter, we'd like to keep options open. But in terms of > Street Fighter IV, this is definitive...

Obviously there can be updates via DLC so perhaps in > 2011, we could upload a patch for Super Street Fighter IV 2011 edition that > would have tuning and balancing. But as a packaged product, I think this is > the last.\\" Ports=Arcade version On April 4, 2010, an arcade version of Super Street Fighter IV was confirmed by producer Yoshinori Ono during the Japanese Street Fighter IV finals. Various playtests were handled in various arcades as well as appearing during the Street Fighter IV finals at Tougeki - Super Battle Opera. For the arcade version of the game, every character received various tweaks, ranging from character balancing to new EX moves. The arcade version of SSFIV added twin brothers Yun and Yang from the Street Fighter III series as playable characters, and introduced Evil Ryu and Oni as hidden bosses. During the launch of the arcade version, a launch trailer was uploaded teasing secret characters Evil Ryu and Oni. Various arcades around the United States who obtained Arcade Edition units also were since able to gain access to the initially non-selectable, then unannounced characters planned for a later release. Videos featuring Evil Ryu and Oni were requested to be closed as well as accounts suspended at the request of Capcom. Evil Ryu became officially playable on March 25, 2011, while Oni was released on April 8, 2011. As with the previous version, the arcade version of Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition utilizes an NESYS Card system which allows players to keep and track their BP and PP statistics. The pre-match screen will now show a national rank and a prefectural rank as well as an introduction message up to 30 characters long. The arcade version of the game would be later ported to home platforms in the form of Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition, offered as both a retail game, and as an update to Super Street Fighter IV. Nintendo 3DS adaptation At E3 2010, Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition was announced for the Nintendo 3DS. It takes advantage of its features such as autostereoscopic 3D and improved wireless features, such as Wi-Fi. In an interview with Famitsu, Yoshinori Ono stated that the gameplay would be the same as Super Street Fighter IV. Ono hoped that they can put all the gameplay modes from the console release on the game, plus original content, and they were looking to the possibility of including arranged costumes. Famitsu stated that all the 35 console characters, plus all the systems, would be on the 3DS release. The game has been called \\"exactly the same\\" as its HD counterparts by Capcom. The game features two control schemes, Light and Pro. Light mode allows players to set up to four hotkeys for moves and combos on the touchscreen, with each character having a custom loadout. For Pro players, combos have to be performed manually, but hotkeys can still be assigned to certain commands to compensate for the 3DS's control layout. The game can be played either in the traditional 2D viewpoint, or in an optional over the shoulder 3D view. Also announced was the ability to swap \\"trophies\\" using \\"StreetPass\\" and the ability to launch into battles when in proximity of another Street Fighter IV player. The game will also feature Download Play, allowing two local players who have downloaded the game from another player to play against each other without a copy of the game (though these players are restricted to only one stage and Ryu). Updates=Downloadable content In Asia, a voucher for a downloadable Super Street Fighter IV OVA featuring Juri was supplied in the Collector's Edition of the Xbox 360 version. The 40-minute feature serves as an origin story to Juri and a canonical precursor to the game. Although having been fully dubbed in English, the movie was not released outside of Asia until its inclusion as part of the Street Fighter 25th Anniversary Collector's Set in 2012.25th Anniversary Collector's Set  Street Fighter 25th Anniversary Owners of the original Street Fighter IV costume DLC packs are able to access their previously purchased DLC packs in the new game, as well as having two extra colors unlocked which are only available upon detecting a save from that game. A downloadable Tournament Mode was released on June 15, 2010. As with its previous incarnation, Super Street Fighter IV offers optional alternate costumes for each of the characters through paid DLC. Sold in packs, the first bundle was made available on April 27, 2010. Between October 27, 2010, and early 2011, players can purchase another set of optional alternate costumes through paid DLC packs. Arcade Edition Released in July 2012, Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition is an update that brings the changes in the arcade version of Super Street Fighter IV to the home systems. The update, available as downloadable content in the console versions, and a retail game for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows, includes several balance changes, as well adding Yun, Yang, Oni and Evil Ryu as playable characters. Ultra Street Fighter IV A new update for Street Fighter IV titled Ultra Street Fighter IV was announced in July 2013. The new edition was released on June 4, 2014 as an arcade machine, a DLC add-on for existing console versions of Super Street Fighter IV, and as a stand-alone game containing DLC from previous iterations. Along with various gameplay tweaks and additional modes, the update adds six additional stages and five additional characters: Rolento, Elena, Poison and Hugo (all ported from their Street Fighter x Tekken appearances), as well as an all-new character, Decapre.http://shoryuken.com/2014/03/16/capcom-reveals-decapre-as- ultra-street-fighter-ivs-fifth-roster-addition/ Reception IGN gave the Super Street Fighter IV a 9.0 and an Editor's Choice award, calling it \\"a superior version of one of the best fighting games around... with a far more developed online mode compared to the original version\\". GameTrailers gave the game 9.3, praising it for its improvements over the original. Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann gave the game 5/5 saying \\"Super Street Fighter IV adds enough great new content to justify skipping over the 'Champion Edition' and 'Hyper Fighting' steps in the Street Fighter upgrade path.\\" GameSpot gave the game a 9.0, commenting that \\"Super Street Fighter IV stands tall on the broad shoulders of its predecessor.

Statistics Canada also recognizes it as a designated place under the name of Pigeon Mountain. It is located within Alberta's Rockies at Highway 1 exit 98, approximately southeast of CanmoreThis refers to the core of Canmore; Canmore's extended town limits actually extend to the Trans-Canada Highway immediately south of and adjacent to the hamlet. and west of Calgary.  History  A variety of explanations account for the origin of the hamlet's name. One explanation associates it with a murder which took place in 1904 at a dairy farm situated on the flats of the Bow River. Francois Marret stood trial in Calgary for killing his brother Jean, whose body he had disposed of in the Bow River, but the jury acquitted him by reason of insanity. Another account states that two or three First Nations people who were illegally trapping beaver noticed a warden approaching in the distance. Knowing that they did not have time to flee without being spotted, they smeared themselves with beaver blood and pretended to be dead. The warden, fooled by their deception, ran for help. Meanwhile, the trappers took their beaver pelts and escaped. This account is regarded as dubious; for example, no known description of this incident appears in the official wardens' reports. In 1954, the Calgary Herald wrote that it was \\"named only 10 to 12 years ago after a man was found shot in a cabin in the area.\\" However, the phrase \\"Dead Man's flat\\" (lower-case \\"f\\" without the plural \\"s\\" at the end) is used in the August 25th, 1924 edition of the Calgary Herald. In an article that describes some recent events in Canmore it is stated that \\"A party of Canmore boys...returned last week from a seven days' outing at Dead Man's flat.\\" They went on the outing for the purpose of fishing. \\"Canmore Veterans Hold Annual Picnic.\\" Calgary Herald. Page 4. Aug. 25th, 1924. Retrieved using Newspapers.com on Jan. 13th, 2020. From 1974 to 1985 the hamlet was officially called Pigeon Mountain Service Centre, but it changed its name to Dead Man's Flats in 1985 to encourage tourism. The new name had been unofficially used to designate the hamlet for several decades prior. Before the Trans-Canada highway was constructed through the area in the 1950s, it was sparsely populated Crown land; among the only structures in the area were a corral and a camper's cabin. Proximity to the new national highway spurred the hamlet's development as a commercial service centre and rest stop for travelers and truck drivers. Businesses currently operating include motels, a Husky truck stop with a 24-hour diner, and the Mad Dog Caf√© and Market. Recently the area has been the subject of proposed developments which would involve the construction of a new residential neighbourhood and a light industrial park.

COMMUNIA effort is aimed at helping to frame the general discourse on and around the public domain in the digital environment by highlighting the challenges arising from the increasingly complex interface between scientific progress, technological innovation, cultural development, socio-economic change on the one hand and the rise and mass deployment/usage of digital technologies in the European information society. Coordinated by Prof. Juan Carlos De Martin of the Politecnico of Torino's NEXA Research Center for Internet and Society, Mauro Vecchio, Nexa, un manifesto per il pubblico dominio, \\"Punto Informatico\\", 25 gennaio 2010 COMMUNIA started its activities on 1 September 2007 and ended on 28 February 2011. The network includes 51 members (initially were 36) - universities, consumer organisations, libraries, archives, non-profit entities, etc. - mostly from the EU, but also from a few overseas countries, such as United States and Brazil, where similar policy discussions are underway. Among its activities, COMMUNIA is organizing several workshops and three International conferences in EU countries, and will produce and disseminate a final strategic report. Under the title \\"Global Science and the Economics of Knowledge-Sharing Institutions\\", the Second COMMUNIA International Conference was held in June 2009 in Torino, Italy. The event addressed the conceptual foundations and practical feasibilities of contractually constructed ‚Äúcommons‚Äù and related bottom-up public domain initiatives (joint policy guidelines, common standards, institutional policies, etc.) capable of offering shared access to a variety of research resources, identifying models, needs and opportunities for effective initiatives across a diverse range of research areas. The third and final conference was held on 28‚Äì30 June 2010 in Torino, Italy, under the title of Universities & Cyberspace: Reshaping Knowledge Institutions for the Networked Age.University and Cyberspace: Reshaping Knowledge Institutions for the Networked Age, Berkman Center for Internet & Society, Harvard University, June 30, 2010, 25 gennaio 2010 In several sessions, workshops and keynote speeches, more than 200 attendees from all over the world discussed such issues as: What can universities contribute to the future of the internet? How can our educational institutions promote ideals of free exchange of information yet cope with the complex intellectual property challenges presented by the Net? Video-recordings, papers and other material related to the conference are fully available on the COMMUNIA website. Also, YouTube hosts several videos, including many video-interviews with Conference speakers. Along with on-going activities of its five working groups (particularly finalized to the Project's Final Strategic Report), the COMMUNIA network co-hosted the Free Culture Research ConferenceThe 3rd Free Culture Research Conference: October 8-9, Berlin (October 8‚Äì9, 2010) in Berlin. The COMMUNIA network also drafted the Public Domain Manifesto, a document aimed at \\"reminding citizens and policy-makers of a common wealth that, since it belongs to all, it is often defended by no-one\\". The Manifesto has been signed by hundreds of individuals and organizations worldwide, and anybody can sign it. Another initiative launched within the context of COMMUNIA is Public Domain Day: Every year on New Year's Day, due to the expiration of copyright protection terms on works produced by authors who died several decades earlier, thousands of works enter the public domain (differing in the various countries according to their copyright laws). Several events were also planned for January 1, 2011, to celebrate the role of the public domain in our societies.

Lodhas have been in the focus of anthropologists and social activists. During the early period of their rule, the British government in India oppressed the tribal people of Jungle Mahals, who were traditionally dependent upon the forests for a living. They had revolted but were ruthlessly suppressed. Having been deprived of their livelihood and without any alternatives, they took to criminal ways of life and were subsequently branded a criminal tribe.

The main character is a 13-year-old Indian-Canadian teenager named Indira \\"Indie\\" Mehta. The program is a single- camera series intended for a youth audience. The series was created by Vera Santamaria, John May, and Suzanne Bolch. The series ran for two seasons and aired its final episode on October 24, 2011 on YTV in Canada and May 26, 2012 on Disney Channel in the United Kingdom. Plot The program follows Indie's journey as she tries to get the most out of life despite the travails of junior high school and the expectations of her Indian parents. She is joined by her two best friends Marlon Parks and Abigail \\"Abi\\" Flores. She often falls into the trap of caring more about what her peers think of her than who she wants to be herself, and consequently spends a lot of time trying to impress her classmates. When not focusing on Indie, the show focuses on Marlon and Abi. A given episode will usually show Marlon's quirky antics getting him into a troublesome situation. Abi will have to help extricate him, which she willingly does, feeling pity on him. Sometimes, however, they swap roles as Marlon tries to play it cool. Production The show is produced by Heroic Film Company in association with DHX Media and YTV and created by writer Vera Santamaria Suzanne Bolch and John May. Season one filmed 26 twenty-five-minute episodes and first premiered on 2 October 2009. The show was a part of YTV's 'Big Fun Weeknights'. A second season began filming in summer 2010, shooting five episodes and resumed filming in November 2010. The second season premiered on October 11, 2010.

In Islam the souls of the unrighteous are punished by two angels in the grave, while the righteous find the grave \\"peaceful and blessed\\".J.A.C. Brown, Misquoting Muhammad, 2014: p.46 The punishment of the grave is not mentioned in the Quran, but in hadiths such as those compiled by Ibn Hanbal and appears as early as the 9th century, still present among the majority of Sunnis and Shias.Sarah Tarlow, Liv Nilsson Stutz The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of Death and Burial OUP Oxford A similar concept can be found in Jewish mythology, there the wicked are punished by angels of destruction, in an intermediary state between the Resurrection of the dead and the individual death. Islam The Quran itself gives only brief references about the period between death and the resurrection. However it mentions that certain individuals such as martyrs are alive and not dead in and also indicates, that some are already in hell in .Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad Islamic Understanding of Death and Resurrection State University of New York Press 1981 p. 32 The term Barzakh indicates that the deceased and the living are entirely separated and can not interact with each other. Otherwise Barzakh refers to the whole period between the Day of Resurrection and death and is used synonymously for \\"grave\\". Others regard barzakh as a world dividing and simultaneously connecting the realm of the dead and the living.Christian Lange Paradise and Hell in Islamic Traditions Cambridge University Press, 2015 p. 122 Therefore, some Muslim traditions argue about possibilities to contact the dead by sleeping on graveyards.Werner Diem, Marco Sch√∂ller The Living and the Dead in Islam: Epitaphs as texts Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2004 p. 116 Despite the brief mentionings of the Quran, Islamic tradition discusses elaborately, almost in graphic detail, as to what exactly happens before, during, and after death. After the burial each person is interrogated in the grave by two angels, called Munkar and Nakir, appointed by God to question the dead in order to test their faith. The righteous believers answer correctly and live in peace and comfort while the sinners and disbelievers fail and punishments ensue. In the life of Barzakh, the souls of the sinners and disbelievers are kept and punished in a place called Sijjin which is said to be located at the lowest level of the earth (traditionally hell, before the Day of resurrection or underworld).Maariful Quran (exegesis of the Quran) by Muhammad Shafi Usmani. Karachi. Chapter 83. The books containing the full records of their deeds are also kept here. On the other hand, the souls of the righteous believers are kept in a place called Illiyin. Their books of deeds are also kept here. According to some account, Illiyin is located in the heaven. There is belief that the fire which represents the own bad deeds can already be seen during the Punishment of the Grave, and that the spiritual pain caused by this can lead to purification of the soul.http://www.eslam.de/begriffe/f/feuer.htm  Judaism  Rabbinic literature offer many traditions about punishing angels, chastising the dead.

Detached from Major General Zachary Taylor's main force in 1835, he held native Americans in check on the Texas frontier. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel, Second Regiment of Dragoons, on June 30, 1846, and ordered to join General Taylor's force during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War at the Rio Grande. Later, he commanded the cavalry of Major General Winfield Scott's army in the campaign to capture Mexico City.

After the Battle of Fort Sumter that began the American Civil War and Virginia's secession in April 1861, Fauntleroy resigned his U.S. Army commission in May 1861 and returned to his native Commonwealth. Governor of Virginia John Letcher appointed Fauntleroy as brigadier general of the Provisional Army of Virginia. However, by the following month, the Confederate States Army had been organized and the Provisional Army of Virginia was merged into it.

Admitted to the bar in 1629, Fountaine distinguished himself by refusing to pay the war tax levied by parliament and, pursuant to a resolution of the House of Commons was ‚Äúsecured and disarmed‚Äù and imprisoned in the Gatehouse.

He was involved in royalist organizing in 1645, but later recommended compromise, and joined the anti-royalist government. For this, Edward Foss labelled him ‚ÄúTurncoat Fountaine.‚Äù In 1651 he was pardoned and restored to full citizenship, and later appointed to various public offices.

Distributors stated that the law was required to prevent producers from severing ties with Illinois distributors and \\"outsourcing\\" their deals, ostensibly resulting in thousands of job losses throughout the state. After the law was passed, all Illinois distributors raised their prices. The Federal Trade Commission actively lobbied against the law, to no avail. The unofficial \\"Wirtz Law\\" name comes from the fact that the law was passed after Wirtz Corporation owner Bill Wirtz and other distributors had contributed over $700,000 to Illinois state legislators; editorials at the time decried the law as a \\"corrupt document\\". Ultimately the unpopular Wirtz Law only remained on the books for three years before it was struck down by a U.S. District Court judge who said that it violated the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The law and its history went on to become a case study for campaign finance reform. An earlier, similar law, the Beer Industry Fair Dealing Act (which dated to 1982), resulted in a popular Michigan microbrewer, Bell's Brewery, getting into a dispute with their distributor and pulling their products from the Illinois market entirely in protest in 2006. Bell's re-entered the Chicago market in 2007 via two new distributors by creating two new beer brands, Kalamazoo Royal Amber Ale and Kalamazoo Hopsoulution. Since each beer avoided the use of the \\"Bell's\\" name and logo, and used a different recipe from previous Bell's brands, Larry Bell contended that these are not the same beers that were assigned to his former distributor. Nevertheless, Bell stated at the time that he expected \\"to be sued by his former distributor, National Wine & Spirits.\\" Initially, only the Royal Amber Ale was made available, in draft only, at about a dozen Chicago-area locations. In August 2008, Bell's returned its primary brands to the Chicago area after National Wine & Spirits' exit from Illinois, upon the sale of their Illinois distributorship to Wirtz Corp.

Later, Joe would do the same for his children. The family later moved west to Benson,[Yarn spinner enthralls kids, adults by Rosalie Robles Crowe; Arizona Daily Star dated 3/6/2009] a small town in Arizona. Spending his late childhood and adolescent years in Southern Arizona, Joe picked up the Spanish that would become an integral part of his storytelling and writing. Joe currently lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Education and Employment In 1968, Joe graduated from the University of Arizona with a bachelor's degree in English. He started teaching at Sunnyside High School in Tucson, Arizona. Joe left teaching and was employed in mineral exploration work from 1972 to 1976, working all over the western U.S. as well as in Mexico and Spain. He returned to Los Alamos, New Mexico, in 1976 and again taught English. His interest in storytelling deepened, partly due to the early influence of his father, and he started to share the tales with a broader audience. In 1979, he began to devote himself full-time to sharing stories. He focuses on elementary school audiences, although his work appeals to a wide range of ages. In 1989, he was designated a New Mexico Eminent Scholar by the New Mexico Commission on Higher Learning. He is a guest lecturer at colleges and universities and delivered the commencement address at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The conflict happened when Ming China's treasure fleet returned to Ceylon in 1410 or 1411 and resulted in the overthrow of King Alakeshvara, who was replaced by Parakramabahu VI of the previous royal family. Background In Ceylon, the Kotte kingdom had waged a war against the Jaffna Kingdom. In that war, Alakeshvara gained military prestige. He soon came to power, ruled Kotte by a puppet king from the previous royal dynasty, and eventually usurped the throne of the kingdom. During the Ming treasure voyages, a large Chinese fleet, led by Zheng He, arrived into local waters to establish Chinese control and stability of the maritime routes in the waters around Ceylon and southern India. Alakeshvara posed a threat to Chinese trade by committing piracy and hostilities in the local waters. Alakeshvara was hostile to the Chinese presence in Ceylon during the first Ming treasure voyage and so Zheng He decided to leave Ceylon for other destinations.. During the third Ming treasure voyage, the Chinese fleet returned to the Kotte Kingdom. This time, the Chinese came to depose Alakeshvara by military force. states that the confrontation against Alakeshvara in Ceylon most likely happened during the outward journey of the Chinese fleet in 1410, rather than the homeward journey in 1411,. but he also notes that most authorities think that the confrontation happened during the homeward journey in 1411. War On their return to Ceylon, the Chinese were overbearing and contemptuous of the Sinhalese, whom they considered to be rude, disrespectful, and hostile.. They also resented that the Sinhalese were committing hostilities towards neighboring countries that had diplomatic relations with Ming China. Zheng He and 2,000 Chinese troops traveled overland into Kotte because Alakeshvara had lured them into his territory. Alakeshvara soon cut off Zheng He and his 2,000 troops from the Chinese treasure fleet anchored at Colombo. Alakeshvara planned to launch a surprise attack on the fleet. In response, Zheng He and his troops invaded Kotte and conquered its capital. They captured Alakeshvara with his family and principal officials.. The Sinhalese Army hastily returned and surrounded the capital but was repeatedly defeated in battle by the invading Chinese troops. Aftermath After the third Ming treasure voyage, Zheng He returned to Nanjing on 6 July 1411 and presented the Sinhalese captives to the Yongle Emperor,. who eventually decided to free Alakeshvara and return him to Ceylon. The Chinese were allied with Parakramabahu VI and had him replace Alakeshvara, whom they had dethroned.. The Yongle Emperor had requested from the Ministry of Rites to recommend someone to serve as the new king of Kotte. As documented in Chinese records, Parakramabahu VI was chosen by the Sinhalese present at the Ming court, nominated by the Ming emperor and installed by Zheng He with the backing of his fleet.. By the time the Chinese embassy arrived, the previous Sinhalese dynasty had re-established itself in Kotte. With Parakramavahu VI as the ruler in Ceylon, both economic and diplomatic relations between China and Ceylon improved. The Chinese treasure fleet experienced no hostilities during visits to Ceylon on subsequent voyages. On 13 September 1411, the emperor granted both rewards and promotions for those who participated in the Sinhalese confrontation after the joint recommendation of the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Rites..

Education and career Pandala completed his Bachelor's in Architecture from College of Engineering Trivandrum. Pandala studied for a Masters in Urban Design at the School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi. He had his Fellowship in Heritage Conservation at University of York and at Fort Brockhurst English Heritage Training Centre in the U.K. He was the founding head of the second school of Architecture in Kerala (1985) located at kollam where he spent educating and researching on traditional building technologies of India. Pandala while studying at Delhi School of Planning and Architecture met the legendary architect Hassan Fathy, and was inspired to build with mud. As a nature lover, and cultural heritage conservation activist, he designs buildings with natural materials, landscapes with biodiversity conservation, and native vegetation, preferring interesting organic forms. Pandala built his first mud house in Kollam in 1996, comprising 2,500 sq. ft. of building, bringing him to the public's attention. His unique Architecture style paved way to many awards, and recognition. In 2011, Lalith Kala Academy awarded him the first Laurie Baker award (The Hindu The Sunday, 30 January 2011). The Designer of the year Award given by Inside Outside design magazine in 2007 (Kerala artist retreat bags best eco-friendly design award Business Standard Sunday, 25 March 2012) was for eco friendly design. His heritage Conservation project in East Fort Trivandrum was chosen for a commendation award by Inside Outside magazine in 2004. In 1999 for one of his residential building built with mud \\"Bodhi\\", Pandala was given, a Commendation award, by J.K. Foundations, Architect of the year award. Fort Cochin Heritage conservation project, Trivandrum East Fort Conservation projects, is often cited as good examples of Kerala heritage conservation initiatives. This was led by Eugene Pandala‚Äôs conservation team enabling the State Government to win the PATA award. Sustainable architecture/Green buildings is a field where Pandala has excelled. His Tsunami rehabilitation project for Malayala Manorama and buildings for hospitality industries receives wide acclaim due to its interwoven complicity with nature. He was a keynote speaker at the 361 degree conference 2016 held at Nehru centre in Mumbai. In March 2016, British council hosted Pandala for their Great Talk Series in Mumbai and at Pune.

His death occurred after he was brutally beaten by several boys with pieces of a railroad tie. Police initially arrested four individuals, Silvonus Shannon, Eric Carson, Eugene Riley, and Eugene Bailey, who were charged with first-degree murder.

Public response The amateur video footage of the beating, obtained by Chicago television station WFLD, was widely broadcast in both traditional and online media. Largely resulting from the widespread circulation of this video, the story attracted much national attention within the United States, leading President Barack Obama to send U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to Chicago to discuss youth violence with Mayor Richard M.

During drug design and development, it is important for pharmaceutical companies to ensure that new drugs do not show significant activity at any of a range of antitargets, most of which are discovered largely by chance. Among the best-known and most significant antitargets are the hERG channel and the 5-HT2B receptor, both of which causing long-term problems with heart function that can prove fatal (long QT syndrome and cardiac fibrosis, respectively), in a small but unpredictable proportion of users. Both of these targets were discovered as a result of high levels of distinctive side-effects during the marketing of certain medicines, and, while some older drugs with significant hERG activity are still used with caution, most drugs that have been found to be strong 5-HT2B agonists were withdrawn from the market, and any new compound will almost always be discontinued from further development if initial screening shows high affinity for these targets. Agonism of the 5-HT2A receptor is an antitarget due to the hallucinogenic effects that 5-HT2A receptor agonists are associated with. According to David E. Nichols, \\"Discussions over the years with many colleagues working in the pharmaceutical industry have informed me that if upon screening a potential new drug is found to have serotonin 5-HT2A agonist activity, it nearly always signals the end to any further development of that molecule.\\" There are some exceptions however, for instance efavirenz and lorcaserin, which can activate the 5-HT2A receptor and cause psychedelic effects at high doses.

History The house was built in 1901 for real estate investor Thomas Beare. In 1903, he sold the home to state senator and Grand Forks Mayor Michael F. Murphy (1858-1930) and his wife Margaret Bowler Murphy (1857‚Äì1917). They enlarged and remodeled the residence, building an addition for their family. The house was located on the most prestigious residential street in Grand Forks, and exemplifies the conspicuous consumption of the cities' elite during the Progressive Era and the growth of the Second Dakota Boom (1889-1915). Thr house is a significant example of the Queen Anne style with elements taken from the Classical Revival style. Queen Anne details include decorative chimneys, complexity of roof shapes such as conical turrets and hipped roof dormers, finials, and fish-scale shingled gable ends. The house is a relatively simple expression of the style and shows signs of transition into the Classical Revival style in its symmetrical facade, Ionic columns, Doric details, and regular footprint.

MathSciNet Education Wegner was educated at University of Cambridge and received a Post-Graduate Diploma in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing in 1954, at a time when there were no PhD programs in computer science. He was awarded a PhD from the University of London in 1968 for his book Programming Languages, Information Structures, and Machine Organization, with Maurice Wilkes listed as his supervisor. Research The seminal work for his previous occupation is On Understanding Types which was co-authored with Luca Cardelli. For his latter undertaking, he co-authored several papers and co-edited a book Interactive Computation: the New Paradigm which was published in 2006. Awards Wegner was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1995 and received the ACM Distinguished Service Award in 2000. \\"For many years of generous service to ACM and the computing community, including outstanding and inspiring leadership in publications and in charting research directions for computer science.\\" In 1999, he was awarded the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art, 1st class (\\"√ñsterreichisches Ehrenkreuz f√ºr Wissenschaft u.

The first version of the essay was published in the Polish journal Tw√≥rczo≈õƒá; an adapted version appeared later that year in Les Temps modernes, and later served as an introduction for Sartre's Critique of Dialectical Reason (Paris, 1960).'Questions de m√©thode', Les Temps Modernes, September 1957, pp. 338-417; October 1957, pp. 658‚Äì98. 'Question de m√©thode', Critique de la Raison dialectique, Paris, 1960. See Ian H. Birchall, Sartre against Stalinism, pp. 173, 183 Sartre argues that existentialism and Marxism are compatible, even complementary, even though Marxism's materialism and determinism might seem to contradict the abstraction and radical freedom of existentialism. Summary=Marxism and Existentialism Sartre's opening chapter discusses the relationship between Marxism and existentialism. Sartre sees Marxism as the dominant philosophy for the current era of history and existentialism as a reinforcing complement. Most of the chapter discusses how existentialism fails to stand on its own as a school of thought while Marxism has become corrupted by the Soviets and other orthodox Communists who abuse the system of thought. Sartre sees existentialism as a reaction to this abuse.Desan, 44. Sartre opens his first chapter by defining philosophy. He argues that there are many philosophiesSartre, 3. and that a current, active philosophy unifies all current knowledge and represents the \\"rising\\" class becoming conscious of itself.Sartre, 4. Sartre breaks modern philosophy down into three eras: mercantile John Locke and Ren√© Descartes, industrial Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and contemporary Karl Marx.Sartre, 7.Desan, Wilfrid. The Marxism of Jean-Paul Sartre. Garden City, New York: Anchor Books, 1965. p.43. Sartre classifies existentialism as an ideology instead of a philosophySartre, 8. since it failed to establish itself as an independent system of thought and did not establish itself as the conscious of a new class. Early existentialism, represented by S√∏ren Kierkegaard, did not stand on its own as a unified system of thought. Instead, Kierkegaard's work stood only as the opposition to Hegel's. The existence of Kierkegaard's thought depended on the existence of Hegel's since it is solely a reaction to it.Desan, 44 Karl Jaspers also failed to establish existentialism in a place of historical importance since his theories are directed inward, toward the self instead of outward, to society.Sartre, 16. Sartre then turns to his own experience with Marx. He describes an early attraction to Marx's thoughtSartre, 17‚Äì19. since it did a better job of describing the condition of the proletariat than the \\"optimistic humanism\\" that was being taught at university.Sartre, 19. Despite this affinity toward Marx's works, Sartre claims that his generation's interpretation of Marxism remained tainted by idealism and individualism until World War II broke down the dominant societal structures.Sartre, 20. Despite this apparent victory of Marxism, existentialism persisted because Marxism stagnated.Sartre, 21‚Äì22. Marxism became a tool for the security and policies of the Soviet Union. The Soviets halted the organic conflict and debate that develops a philosophy, and turned Marxist materialism into an idealism in which reality was made to conform to the a priori, ideological beliefs of Soviet bureaucrats. Sartre points to the Hungarian Uprising of 1956 where Soviet leaders assumed that any revolt must be counter-revolutionary and anti-Marxist when, in fact, the Hungarian revolt came directly from the working class.Sartre, 23‚Äì24. In contrast to this inflexible mode of thinking, Sartre points to Marx's writings on the Revolutions of 1848 and the French coup d'√©tat of 1851 in which Marx examined class relations instead of taking them as given.Sartre, 26.Desan, 46. Sartre notes that his contemporary Marxists maintained a focus on \\"analysis\\" but criticizes this analysis as a superficial study focused on verifying Marxist absolutes (\\"eternal knowledge\\") instead of gaining an understanding of historical perspective, as Marx himself did.Sartre, 27. Sartre turns his criticism on to other methods of investigation. He says that \\"American Sociology\\" has too much \\"theoretic uncertainty\\" while the once promising psychoanalysis has stagnated. Unlike these methods and the generally dominant idealism, existentialism and Marxism offer a possible means of understanding mankind and the world as a totality.Sartre, 28‚Äì29. Sartre claims that the class war predicted by Marxism has failed to occur because orthodox Marxism has become too rigid and \\"Scholastic\\".Sartre, 29. Despite its stagnation, Marxism remains the philosophy of this time. Both existentialism and Marxism see the world in dialectical terms where individual facts are meaningless; truth is found not in facts themselves but in their interaction: they only gain significance as part of a totality.Sartre 30. Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs argued that existentialism and Marxist materialism could not be compatible, Sartre responds with a passage from Engels showing that it is the dialectic resulting from economic conditions that drives history just as in Sartre's dialectically driven existentialism. Sartre concludes the chapter by citing Marx from Das Kapital: \\"The reign of freedom does not begin in fact until the time when the work imposed by necessity and external finality shall cease...\\"From Das Kapital III, Sartre, 34. Sartre, following Marx, sees human freedom limited by economic scarcity. For Sartre, Marxism will remain the only possible philosophy until scarcity is overcome;Desan, 47. moreover, he sees even conceiving of a successor theory‚Äîor what one might look like‚Äîas impossible until the scarcity problem is overcome.Sartre, 34. The Problem of Mediations and Auxiliary Disciplines Sartre opens the chapter by asking \\"Why, then, are we not simply Marxists?\\". Marxism provides guiding principles and problems, but not knowledge. Contemporary Marxists regard Marxist theory as a source of actual knowledge, but Sartre sees it only as a set of problems in search of a method.Sartre, 35, As in the first chapter, Sartre sees Marxism's flaw in rigidity: an \\"a priori\\" theory that forces events into \\"prefabricated molds.\\"Sartre, 27 Sartre again turns to Luk√°cs, his foil. He ascribes to Luk√°cs the opinion that the realization of German existentialism was Nazism while French existentialism can be dismissed as a petits bourgeois reaction to the German occupation. Sartre rejects Luk√°cs' view by pointing out that, while Heidegger embraced the Nazis, Jaspers did not. Sartre also began work on his philosophy in 1930 and was wrapping up his work by the time of the occupation.Sartre, 37‚Äì38. He argues that, as a Marxist, Luk√°cs is incapable of understanding Heidegger and existentialism.Sartre, 27‚Äì28. Marxism takes events and constructs universals, then imposes those universals on subsequent events. Existentialism does not assume a single, real totality, but sees history as an interactive relationship between events and humans.Desan, 50. Sartre turns to the example of the French Revolution. While Marxists have argued that the complicated events of the Revolution can be broken down into class conflict, Sartre says the Revolution cannot be understood only on the terms of Marxist class analysis.Sartre, 42. He proposes a process of \\"mediations\\" to analyze how ideological and social factors guide the course of history, which is only indirectly influenced by economics and class. Progressive-Regressive method Sartre proposes a method of thought that combines historical materialism with existentialist psychoanalysis.Flynn, Thomas. \\"Jean-Paul Sartre.\\" Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 22 April 2004. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/ Reception In the introduction to her translation of Search for a Method, the philosopher Hazel Barnes compares Sartre's views of Marx and Marxism to those of Erich Fromm, as expressed in Marx's Concept of Man (1961). The philosopher Walter Kaufmann argues that Sartre's embrace of Marxism represents the end of existentialism, since following the publication of Search for a Method, neither Sartre nor any other major thinker writes as an existentialist (though Kaufmann adds that existentialism understood in a looser sense continues).

In December 1914 he requested compassionate leave in order to visit his father, who was dying of tuberculosis. Permission was refused, so Bell deserted. However, in January 1915, he re-enlisted in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers under the name of Frank William Bell, falsifying both his name and date of birth. In mid-1915 he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps as an Observer/Machine Gunner in No. 9 Squadron RFC. In his log book he signed his name as G. W.

Bell scored his first victory on 25 July 1918 while flying in a DH.9 of 49 Squadron RAF, with pilot Lieutenant Arthur Rowe Spurling, shooting down a Fokker D.VII fighter over Mont-Notre-Dame. On 23 August 1918, which was Bell's 21st birthday, Bell and Spurling were returning from a bombing mission in their DH.9 when they became separated from their squadron in cloud. After some time Spurling descended, believing that he must have crossed the front lines. Seeing an airfield below he prepared to land, only to see a formation of thirty enemy aircraft rising towards him. Only then did Spurling and Bell realize that they were still over German territory. Spurling dived through the middle of the formation, destroying one aircraft and seeing two more spin out of control. Bell also shot down two more aircraft, before they made their escape. Spurling was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, largely on the strength of this action, and Bell was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal. His logbook records that Bell was hospitalized in Boulogne from 24 August and was returned to England on the 28th. In September he was assigned to No. 11 Squadron RAF.

Bell the opportunity, which he took quick advantage of, by shooting down two of the enemy aircraft in flames, while the remaining three broke off the combat and disappeared in the mist.

Early life Harry Likas was born in San Francisco, CA on February 27, 1924. He started playing Northern California and National Junior tournaments. Likas was rated the number one youth in the nation and won the Boy‚Äôs California Championship. At 18, Likas was selected to be on the National Junior Davis Cup team. After graduating from Lowell High School in San Francisco, Likas went on to play tennis for the University of San Francisco where he eventually won the 1948 NCAA singles championship beating Vic Seix. He beat five future Wimbledon champions: Jaroslav Drobn√Ω, Bob Falkenburg, Budge Patty, Dick Savitt. He also defeated world Champion Pancho Gonzales. Later life Likas would serve on the board of the United States Tennis Association (USTA Nor Cal), then known as the Northern California Tennis Association, NCTA). In his role as a board member, he transitioned the old Pacific Coast Championships, a tournament he had won as a junior, into a money tournament - the Fireman's Fund Open International. The tournament was played at the Round Hill Country Club in Alamo CA and, due to Likas' role, was televised nationally on PBS. He married Ann Katharine Jessup in 1950, and had four children and was active in the securities business and coached professional tennis players.

In this picture, the line of scrimmage is the horizontal white-painted 10-yard line Offside is a minor foul in gridiron football caused when a defender crosses the line of scrimmage ahead of the snap of the ball. The penalty associated with the infraction is the advancing of the ball five yards and a replay of the down. History=Definition In gridiron football, offside is a foul in which a player is on the wrong side of the line of scrimmage when the ball is snapped. This foul occurs simultaneously with the snap. Unlike offensive players, defensive players are not compelled to come to a set position before the snap. If a defender jumps across the line but gets back to his side before the snap, there is no foul. In the case of an offside foul, play is not stopped, and the foul is announced at the conclusion of the play. Media covering the games calls it a \\"free play\\" for the offense, as the non- offending team may decline the penalty and take the yardage gained on the play (and when the play works against them, like a turnover to the opposing team, the non-offending team can accept the penalty and retake possession of the ball)‚Äîunlike in the case of a false start foul against the offense, whereupon the play is immediately stopped by the officials. This foul is almost always committed by the defense (any offensive player that moves into the neutral zone after setting would be charged with a false start). However, it is possible for the offense to commit this foul. If an offensive player lines up in the neutral zone, an offside foul will be called against the offense. If a defensive player jumps the snap too early and causes the offensive player to jump early, the defense will be flagged; if a defensive player jumps too early and touches the offensive player, encroachment will be called. Penalty Prior to 1925, a call of offside against a defensive unit brought with it an automatic first down in addition to a five-yard advancement of the ball for the offense.Associated Press, \\"Forward Pass to Remain Just Same,\\" Corvallis [OR] Gazette-Times, vol. 16, no. 206 (Dec. 30, 1924), pg. 1. However, a December 1924 meeting of the Football Coaches' Association of America spurred a change of rules for the 1925 season eliminating the provision for an automatic first down, while leaving the five yard penalty intact. The penalty for violation remains 5 yards at most levels of professional and amateur play.

His survey of the south coast ports is a valuable and well-known historic document. He also served Arundel as Member of Parliament for approximately ten years and founded the first packet service between Falmouth, Cornwall and the West Indies. He died a bankrupt in the Fleet debtors' prison. In her account of Dummer, Celina Fox sums up his career thus: > Using elements of mathematical calculation and meticulously honed standards > of empirical observation, Dummer tried to introduce a more rational, planned > approach to the task of building ships and dockyards, with the help of his > extraordinary draughting skills. Operating on the margins of what was > technically possible, meeting with opposition from vested interests and > traditional work patterns, he struggled to succeed. Today he is little > recognized outside the circle of naval historians and his grandest building > projects were almost wholly destroyed by later dockyard developments or > bombing. Early career Dummer was baptised on 28 August 1651 at St. Nicolas' Church, North Stoneham, Hampshire, the eldest of four sons born to Thomas Dummer (1626‚Äì1710), gentleman farmer of Chickenhall, in the parish of North Stoneham near Southampton, and his wife, Joanne Newman. He joined the Royal Navy in 1668 and served his apprenticeship as a shipwright under Sir John Tippetts at Portsmouth naval dockyard. In his 1686 account of the state of the Navy, Samuel Pepys wrote that when Dummer was apprenticed to Tippetts, he was \\"mostly employed as his clerk in writing and drawing\\". By 1678, Dummer was employed as an \\"extra clerk\\" in the office of the Surveyor, \\"my patron and friend from my youth upward\\". His job was to make designs for a variety of projects ‚Äì lanthorns, wet docks, lodgings at Sheerness, ships' sterns ‚Äì as well as to draught ships' lines. In 1677, Dummer and Tippetts assisted Sir Anthony Deane, who had been appointed Controller of the Victualling Accounts on the Navy Board, and given the responsibility for establishing for the first time standardised sets of dimensions of ships of the line to be applied to the \\"thirty new ships\\", the largest single shipbuilding programme hitherto undertaken. For his work on establishing the new standards, Dummer was \\"singled out by the Navy Board for his extraordinary ingenuity to lay down the bodies of all the thirty new ships\\". Several of Dummer's draughts from this period survive including a sketch-book Tables of Proportions of Ships, which comprises a series of engraved sheets of squared paper on which are plotted the curves or sweeps of the hulls of one second rate and some of the third rate ships newly built in the Thames and Medway yards. A volume of eight Dummer drawings entitled Draught of the Body of an English Man of War is in the Pepys Library; these are much more elaborate, doubtless intended to show off his extraordinary skills as a draughtsman to potential patrons, and include vertical sections through the ships showing the design and layout of the structure. These works constitute the earliest surviving example of Dummer's skills as a draughtsman, demonstrating a capacity to express an organised tectonic sensibility that was to mark his progress towards the surveyorship. In February 1679, Dummer became caught up in a political dispute involving Pepys and Deane, who had been accused of leaking naval intelligence to France. Amongst the charges laid against Pepys and Deane by Parliament were that \\"they had employed a man to take the bodies of the king's ships, supposed to be no good intention\\". Dummer, \\"being extremely fearful myself what ill use might be made of me, or of the works so innocently meant\\" was taken before the King \\"to prevent (if in him it lay) by the King's approbation and allowance any reflection upon them that were already distressed\\". Dummer was sent to Bristol until January 1680 when he was summoned to attend the Navy Board with his draughts. There he met Deane who had been released from prison though not yet discharged; Deane asked Dummer to make two draughts for him, a promise Dummer failed to keep, having been instructed by the Navy Board not to do so. The Admiralty still appeared to have suspicions about the loyalty of both Dummer and Deane, and at a meeting of the Lords Commissioners it was ordered \\"that I did not at the same time draw draughts for any other and as well as that of the King's service, and ordered they should give me a written order ... and also to report what was fitting to allow me to draught ...\\". By April 1680, Dummer had delivered five draughts; he wrote to the Navy Board to ask \\"whether I can be supposed to draw new draughts by that way I have practised\\". In May he was still asking whether the Board wanted to discharge or continue employing him, warning of his impending ruin: \\"I could have borne the present with more respect and patience, were I not able to say it hath been always my misfortune, that the greatness of the enterprise was never truly valued nor encouraged\\". Although the order to pay him at the rate of ¬£7 per draught was made by the Admiralty to the Navy Board on 24 February and again on 11 May 1680 (with the proviso, \\"to take care before the payment of any of the said sums to the said Mr Dummer, that the work be so performed as may answer the end for which the said draughts were at first designed\\") he was still waiting for payment on 11 June. 1682 voyage to the Mediterranean In July 1682, Dummer (now officially Master Carpenter on HMS Windsor Castle) was commissioned as a midshipman-extraordinary on HMS Woolwich and sent to the Mediterranean \\"in order to his collecting what useful observations should arise to him, in his enquiries through the several foreign ports there, relating either to the said art of ship-building, or the nature and order of the said ports, appearances of land, or ought else than might conduce to our service\\". Dummer had estimated that his expenses for about two years would be ¬£95 4s 0d and it was agreed he was to be reimbursed for that sum by the Treasurer of the Navy. On 3 August 1682, Dummer set out from Deal on the Woolwich, under the command of Captain William Holding, taking the Moorish Ambassador, who had been in England for six months, back to Tangiers. Despite an attempted mutiny by the Ambassador's Moorish retainers while the ship was at anchor in Plymouth Sound, the Woolwich reached Tangiers on 31 August. After a change in command to Lieutenant Rigby (Holding had died and was buried at Tangiers), they sailed on east into the Mediterranean, south of Sardinia and Sicily, across the Ionian Sea to Cephalonia and Zante, then back through the Strait of Messina past the active volcano of Stromboli to Naples and Livorno, where Dummer disembarked, while the Woolwich started back to England on 24 November. Dummer records that he then divided his time between Livorno and Pisa until 11 February 1683, when he received an answer from the Commissioners of the Admiralty \\"to whom I had given an account of my leaving the ship, and the reasons\\" for requesting extended shore leave. During this period, Dummer delivered to Sir Thomas Dereham, the English envoy in Florence, a magnificent panel carved by Grinling Gibbons celebrating the fruits of peace and friendship between princes, which was commissioned by Charles II as a gift for Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Dummer took a keen interest in recording towns, their dockyards and fortifications throughout the Mediterranean, making detailed perspectives and measured plans, producing a visual record of the arsenals of Naples, Livorno, Pisa, Venice, Genoa, Toulon, Marseilles, Gibraltar and Cadiz. In contrast to the English method of building and repairing ships in dry dock, the Mediterranean ports used covered slipways of which Dummer made many drawings. He was particularly impressed by the Venetian Arsenal, drawing it in plan, general and detailed perspective, including A Perspective of the Mode of laying up small Ordnance and A Perspective of Two Arches ... under which Ships & Gallies are Built & Repaired. By April 1683, he was in Toulon where he took the opportunity to carry out a little informal espionage: \\"They with much readiness permit you to go aboard their ships, but it is in such regularity, as not to be done but by a note, under the hand of a special officer\\". Amongst the 50 or more vessels in the harbour was the Royal Louis and two more first-rate vessels. Dummer described the fleet as a \\"good fleet, but in appearance ill built, or through some weakness in long living have generally put their wales a little straight in the midships\\". He described the Royal Louis as \\"a great ship and glorious in her first carving, no doubt; but to my judgment not of good proportion, nor good workmanship, her figure under water I know not, nor is that above to be admired\\". Dummer reported that in Toulon, \\"all ships great & small are built on launches, and are careened when their occasions require it; for here are no docks, an obligation we are not tied to\\". He also made drawings of the new fortifications then under construction to the designs of Vauban. On 14 April 1683, he arrived at Marseilles the home of the French King's galleys, of which there were 35 in the harbour. He described the galleys as \\"the most polite and beautiful I ever saw\\". During the voyage, Dummer diligently carried out the King's orders to make \\"observations upon all foreign shipping\\", from Cadiz to Constantinople. His journal described each vessel, both large and small, in great detail accompanied by both watercolour views and three-dimensional skeleton models. In July 1683 Dummer sailed homewards from Livorno in the Swallow via the Balearic Islands, M√°laga, Alicante, Gibraltar and Cadiz, where on 13 September he received orders to attend Lord Dartmouth in Tangier and stay until the English garrison was given up and destroyed, on 6 February 1684. Dummer returned to England accompanied by Samuel Pepys who had been in Tangier assisting Lord Dartmouth with the evacuation and abandonment of the British colony; they travelled back through Spain, arriving back in England after a particularly rough passage on 30 March 1684. By the end of the year his expenses, which amounted to ¬£150 10s 6d ‚Äì 50% more than his initial estimate ‚Äì had been reimbursed. On the completion of the voyage, Dummer produced a \\"sumptuous volume\\" which is now in the British Library.The full title of his survey is A Voyage into the Mediterranean Seas, containing (by way of Journall) the Viewes and Descriptions of such remarkable Lands, Cities, Towns, and Arsenalls, their severall Planes, & Fortifications, with divers Perspectives of particular Buildings which came within the compass of the said Voyage; Together with the Description of 24 Sorts of Vessells, of common use in those Seas, Designed in Measurable Parts, with an Artificiall Shew of their Bodies, not before so accurately done, Finished in the Yeare 1685, by E. Dummer. and is King's MS.40 of the British Library Chatham While completing the fair copy of his journal, Dummer applied for positions as shipwright based in part on the strength of his skills as a draughtsman. In September 1685, on the recommendation of Pepys (now Secretary to the Admiralty Board), Dummer visited John Evelyn in Deptford. Evelyn was \\"so charmed with his ingenuity\\", he wrote to Pepys, \\"that I look on it as a new obligation to you; and if you find I cultivate it for my own sake a little; you will let him understand ... how much I wish him the improvement of your favours ...\\" In December, following the death of Thomas Shish, the Master Shipwright at Woolwich, Dummer applied for the vacant posts of Assistant Shipwright at Deptford and Chatham; he was supported in his application by John Evelyn, who described him as \\"a diligent and most ingenious man\\", adding \\"in my life I have never observed a young man ... less pragmatical, and of greater modesty, beside his so humble, cheerful and becoming dedication of himself to his patron alone, which is a mark of his discretion, as well as of his duty\\". Thus in 1686, Dummer replaced Daniel Furzer as first assistant master shipwright at Chatham, under Robert Lee, retaining this post until 1689. Writing at the time, Pepys considered Dummer \\"an ingenious young man, but said rarely to have handled a tool in his life, nor knows judiciously how to convert a piece of timber; has been much abroad indeed, but gained his present promotion upon the credit only of his designing and making of draught\\". Surveyor of the Navy On 20 April 1689 Dummer was appointed Assistant Surveyor of the Navy (under Sir John Tippetts) with a salary of ¬£300 a year; on the death of Tippetts in August 1692, he succeeded him as Surveyor at ¬£500 a year. As Surveyor, Dummer endeavoured to strengthen the Navy by extending the measure of uniformity in ship construction initiated by the thirty new ships project. Despite the Navy's desire for standardisation, even the thirty new ships differed in size and tonnage, as shipwrights took the dimensions specified as being minimum rather than absolute measures. To end these disparities, in 1692 Dummer wrote to the men appointed to survey and measure the ships then under construction, enclosing a small printed sketch, with measurement points keyed into letters, \\"to serve for one common rule of direction and information, whereby the parts necessary to be truly measure[d] and known are at one view made intelligible to every man alike: and the numbers to be set down are to respect the letters in the manner following ...\\" His method of measurement was adopted as official practice in April 1696. Dummer was the first surveyor who introduced exact standards for the construction of new vessels, sending each builder with his warrant for building a new ship the precise measurements together with models of the completed vessel. \\"Mr Dummer caused every master builder, at docking a ship, to measure the body and compare the figure\\". In January 1693, following instructions by the Admiralty Board to report on the subject of bomb vessels, Dummer wrote to his old master Robert Lee at Chatham and to Fisher Harding at Deptford, asking them to check the proportions of a bomb-vessel designed by \\"a French engineer (Jean Fournier) who contrived those bomb vessels I saw when I was at Toulon\\". On the basis of their views, an experimental and rather unsatisfactory class of bomb vessels was built to English dimensions and rigging in 1693. A smaller, cheaper and more effective class followed two years later, built to mercantile dimensions in merchant yards. In 1699, Dummer reported to the Admiralty on Thomas Savery's patent designs for a system of paddle-wheels driven by a capstan ‚Äì following Dummer's negative report, the idea was dismissed by the Admiralty. Dummer's main achievement as Surveyor was his development of the royal dockyards at Devonport near Plymouth and at Portsmouth. Devonport In September 1689, shortly after his appointment as Assistant Surveyor he was ordered to report on the most suitable site for a single dry dock at Plymouth. He returned to London in November with details of three possible locations, including sites at Cattewater and Hamoaze, which is a section of the River Tamar, in the parish of Stoke Damerel, including estimates of the cost of building on each site, both in timber and stone. After some debate, the small inlet at Hamoaze was selected; the work was to be done in stone with a protective wet dock in front and, at the insistence of King Willam, the dry dock was made large enough to hold first-rate ships. At Devonport, Dummer was the designer of the first successful stepped stone dry dock in Europe. Previously the Navy Board had relied upon timber as the major building material, which resulted in high maintenance costs and was also a fire risk. The docks Dummer designed were stronger with more secure foundations and stepped sides that allowed shorter timbers to be used for shoring and made it much easier for shipwrights to reach the underside of the vessel. These innovations also allowed rapid erection of staging and greater workforce mobility. He discarded the earlier three-sectioned hinged gate, which was labour-intensive in operation, and replaced it with the simpler and more mobile two-sectioned gate. He wished to ensure that naval dockyards were efficient working units that maximised available space, as evidenced by the simplicity of his design layout for Plymouth. He introduced a centralised storage area and a logical positioning of buildings, and his double rope-house combined the previously separate tasks of spinning and laying while allowing the upper floor to be used for the repair of sails. By 16 September 1694, Dummer reported to the Admiralty, \\"Our docks here are finished and we purpose to take in the cleaning the mouth of the basin from the dam that stands before it, which will be done in a few days; a more particular account I will give you hereafter\\". His Account of the Generall Progress and Advancement of his Majestie's New Docks and Yard at Plymouth was presented to the Principal Officers and Commissioners of the Navy in December 1694. It clearly explains the logical thinking behind his planning of the works, influenced by his extensive travels. Typically, to the description of works undertaken he appended eight draughts: plans of the site, the yard and the dry dock, plans and elevations for the officers' dwelling houses, the great store house, hemp house, rope house and rope yard buildings, for \\"by representations and descriptions of works of this nature, when they are disposed in a manner most familiar and easy of the understanding, one finds at once both encouragement in the contemplation, and satisfaction in the judging of them\\". The drawings therefore served as a means of explanation and a form of advocacy, as well as evidence of and pride in his achievement. In his design for the docks at Devonport, Dummer sought to arrange the buildings as efficiently as possible to eliminate the \\"great abuses committed in their Majesties' yards\\" such as \\"the tedious and expensive practices of carrying all things afloat for expediting of ship works, and which are many times very remote from the places where materials are kept, and workmen resort\\". This led to time-wasting and obstruction and presented opportunities for embezzling ships' stores. Because of the innumerable abuses, \\"too many to be named, and some too subtle to be discovered\\", Dummer ensured that men and materials were placed close together under the constant eye of command, saving time and costs. The thirteen officers' dwelling houses were similarly sited \\"on the most eminent spot of ground in the yard, for the officers' better observance of things abroad, and readier communication and conference with one another, on all occasions\\". An abstract of the costs in Dummer's 1694 account amounted to ¬£50,000, but he was at pains to point out that this was because of the greatness and novelty of the works, which overcame the deficiencies of the other yards. Obstructions had been brought about because of the irregular cash flow, the weakness of contracts and \\"the imbecile stock of a private man under the weight of so chargeable a work\\" (probably referring to the stonemason Robert Waters who was also blamed by Dummer for problems with the works), not to mention the fact that the country was at war. Increases on the original estimate (¬£23,406 in 1692, which nearly tripled by 1698) had, he maintained with some aplomb, been made purposefully by stealth so that they would be borne more easily, rather than by demanding too great a lump sum and getting rejected at the outset. Portsmouth In 1689, Parliament ordered one new dry dock and two new wet docks (or non-tidal basins) to be built at Portsmouth and work began in 1691 at an estimated cost of ¬£15,890. It was built to new designs developed by Dummer who again substituted brick and stone for wood and increased the number of altars or steps. As with all future extensions, the new works were built on reclaimed land and the civil engineering involved was on an unprecedented scale. The great stone dock as it was called (extensively rebuilt in 1769 as No.5 dock) was evacuated with chain pumps powered by horses. A building slip was constructed in No.3 dock where the Mary Rose is now housed. In November 1691 he oversaw the raising and repairing of the 54-gun fourth rate ship St David which had capsized and partially blocked Portsmouth harbour. Survey of the South Coast In June 1698, under orders from the Lords of the Admiralty, Dummer undertook a plan to survey various harbours along the south coast of England, at a time when a new war with France was a real threat, and Portsmouth would have been a major target. In the survey, he was assisted by Captain Thomas Wiltshaw, a fellow Navy Board Commissioner and two Masters of Trinity House, Captain James Conaway and William Cruft, who were assisting the Navy because of their navigational experience. The surveying was completed in the months of July and August 1698, with eighteen harbours being visited ‚Äì the resulting charts appear to be rushed; on close examination they appear to be incomplete as in most cases they show few soundings, only the high and low water lines, and few, if any, navigational features making it difficult for any large vessel to enter one of these so-called ports, but this was not the purpose of this undertaking. Dummer and Wiltshaw were looking for sites for new dockyards, and also to see if any of the existing smaller ports could be improved to accommodate larger vessels. When all the surveys were completed and the critique written up, the work was addressed to the Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy and sent to the Lords of the Admiralty some time after 19 November 1698, just over four months after it was started. It was suggested in this report that the only ports worth considering were the ones in the area around Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight and that no further yards should be built between Dover and Land's End. A copy of this report is held by the Hampshire County Council Museums Service. Survey of the Royal Navy Dockyards In 1698, Dummer also produced his , which gave an account of the improvements which had been made at each of the royal dockyards since 1688, with full descriptions of the various buildings with their quantity and value, together with detailed descriptions of the new docks at Portsmouth and Plymouth. Dummer's survey was part of a general effort on his part and that of a handful of colleagues on the Navy Board to get to grips with the management of the massive business under their charge. Dummer's draughts constitute an extraordinary feat of surveyorship. In the volume, each royal dockyard is treated separately and its description given in the same order, each of the four types of drawing being made to the same scale so that cross-comparisons can be made. The emphasis was on exact measurement, with Dummer combining geometrical precision with great artistry. The first type of drawing relating to each dockyard gives the general situation of the port and harbour; the second focuses on the situation of the yard; the third compares the plan of the yard at the Revolution with its development ten years on, showing the improvements or new buildings added; the fourth ‚Äì the most extensive section ‚Äì gives in plan and elevation every single building in each yard. The Survey first covers each of the royal dockyards on the Thames and Medway ‚Äì Chatham, Sheerness, Woolwich and Deptford ‚Äì as well as the Navy Office, before dealing with the dockyards at Portsmouth and Plymouth. In total it was estimated that the value of His Majesty's Dockyards was ¬£291,124, of which ¬£166,799 had been spent in the previous ten years, more than doubling the original value. The greatest investment had been made at Plymouth of ¬£67,095, followed by Portsmouth (¬£63,384), Deptford (¬£12,880), Chatham (¬£11,155), Woolwich (¬£10,477), Sheerness (¬£1,566) and finally the Navy Office (¬£239). Dummer's achievements as Surveyor for the royal dockyards are highly regarded by present-day naval historians with the new docks at Plymouth and Portsmouth being \\"lasting monuments of his great skill\\". Parliamentary career In November 1695, Dummer stood for election in Portsmouth. The candidates were Admiral Russell, Alderman Hedger, and Edmund Dummer. The inhabitants of Portsea, Portsmouth living within the jurisdiction of the borough and paying \\"Scot and lot\\", supported Dummer and insisted on their right to vote, but were prevented from doing so by measures adopted on behalf of Mr. Hedger. The gates of the town were shut against them, while threats and other unconstitutional measures were resorted to. Although a petition was lodged to have the election overturned, this was not followed up, with Dummer having been elected to represent Arundel in the neighbouring county. Dummer was elected MP for Arundel three times as a supporter of the court, firstly in 1695 until 1698, when he did not stand for re-election. In January 1701 he was re-elected but this position lasted only ten months when he was replaced by Carew Weekes in November. Dummer returned to Parliament the following year and continued to represent the town for a further six years. In his Parliamentary career, he was a supporter of Robert Harley. Greenwich Hospital Dummer was appointed as one of the Governors of the newly opened Greenwich Hospital in 1695, retaining this position until his death in 1713. Downfall Dummer's career as Surveyor of the Navy came to an abrupt end in December 1698, when he was suspended without warning following a dispute with John Fitch, the main contractor undertaking building works at Portsmouth Dockyard. The origin of the dispute went back as far as 1693, when Dummer and Sir Anthony Deane had cause to doubt Fitch's working methods and his claims for payments for \\"overworks\\". There had been endless construction problems, caused partly because the new docks were built on unstable reclaimed land. Fitch's workmen had damaged the entrance to the lower basin causing its banks to slide into the channel on the spring tide, leaving the piling exposed and vulnerable. On 20 June 1695, Dummer wrote from Portsmouth to Harley with the news that the dam which had been constructed the previous winter to shelter the work on the new docks from the sea had been breached. The following January and February he was writing to excuse his attendance at Parliament on account of the need to secure the great dam in the face of terrible weather. By the end of 1696, Dummer had finally ejected Fitch because of fraudulent claims for payment and terrible workmanship. Fitch brought a case for payment against the Crown, with the Attorney General, Richard Haddock, and Dummer himself being named as defendants. The case was first heard in the Court of Exchequer on 23 November 1696 and referred to trial. On 27 April 1697, the Court ordered that the matter be referred for arbitration to four referees, two appointed on behalf of the plaintiff and two on behalf of the defendants, with an umpire to determine between them if they were unable to agree. The party arrived in Portsmouth on 2 June to examine the works and advise on repairs, accompanied by Sir Christopher Wren, in his capacity as Surveyor of the King's Works. After spending a day examining the works, the party returned to London and on 25 August their report took \\"a very strict view of the nature of the said defects\\" and confirmed Dummer's condemnation of the workmanship and ordered that the upper wet dock be taken down and rebuilt. The Exchequer Court issued the final decree in late June or early July 1698, stating that Fitch should have been satisfied with the amounts already paid for the work done on the contract, ¬£13,773 14s 6¬Ωd, and rejected his claims for payment on over work not included. It was also accepted that Fitch was still owed for further contract work completed before he was turned off site, valued at ¬£8,757 1s 5d and ¬£2,030 18s for materials. Fitch then complained to the Admiralty that Dummer had asked for bribes in return for awarding him Navy contracts, claiming specifically that Dummer had told him he would get an immediate certificate for his bill if he made him a present of ¬£100 and helped him with the sale of timber for Plymouth. Although Dummer conceded that he had borrowed ¬£152 from Fitch on behalf of William Wyatt, a Bursledon ship builder, he denied the other charges. With counter-accusations from both sides, Dummer was suspended from office with effect from Christmas Eve 1698. Although his name was cleared by a civil court, which awarded him damages of ¬£364, his career at the Navy Office was abruptly over. He was allowed the title and salary for 1699 but was not reinstated and dismissed by the Lords of the Admiralty on 10 August 1699, with Daniel Furzer, Master Shipwright at Chatham, being appointed in his place from 22 September. Sowley Ironworks In 1700 he and his cousin and namesake, Edmund Dummer of South Stoneham (with whom he has been confused) helped to finance an ironworks at Sowley, near Beaulieu in Hampshire, leased from Ralph, Lord Montagu to Henry Corbett, ironmaster, who had manufactured the two-sectioned gate at Dummer's dry dock at Portsmouth. The works obtained many orders for iron wares from Portsmouth dockyard.J.Greenwood. A history of the ironworks at Sowley.2005 Henry Corbett died in 1708 and Dummer seized his property by writ of exchequer, claiming unpaid debts; Chancery ruled in 1711 that Dummer was the rightful holder of the lease on the ironworks and Corbett's naval contracts. Dummer continued the business until 1712 whilst his brother Thomas (an ex-navy purser) continued to supply the navy until 1716. Packet service In 1694, when Dummer held the appointment of Surveyor of the Navy, he had supervised the construction of a number of exceptionally fast packet-boats (sloops) for the Post Office packet service from Harwich to the Low countries. Dummer also operated a packet service between Falmouth, Corunna and Lisbon. On the loss of his position as Surveyor of the Navy, Dummer devoted much of his energies to studying the problem of a regular packet service between England and the British Island Plantations in the West Indies. In a document dated 18 June 1702, he set out the Terms for settling a monthly intelligence between England and the Island Plantations in the West Indies. Dummer proposed a monthly service to be operated by four oceangoing packet- boats calling at Barbados, Antigua, Montserrat, Nevis and Jamaica. On 30 June, the Crown agreed Dummer's plan, granting special concessions. He was permitted to fly the Queen's colours on his ships, his crews were exempted from impressment for naval service, and he was granted a letter of marque for the duration of the War of the Spanish Succession which had commenced in the previous year. The first transatlantic mail service directly sponsored by the Post Office was inaugurated on 21 October 1702, with the sailing from Portsmouth for Barbados of Dummer's packet Bridgeman. Bridgeman and its sister ship, Mansbridge, had operated on a mail service between Gravesend and Brill in the Netherlands in 1699 and 1700. Two further ships, the King William, of 90 tons and 8 guns, and the Frankland of 132 tons and 10 guns, were purchased to start the service. The four vessels were \\"designed to succeed each other monthly\\" and whose \\"motions are determined to be very quick, because thereon depends the chief fruit that is to be reaped\\". Dummer's fast transatlantic mail service had a best time of 88 days round trip (just under three months). Dummer's packet service created the pattern which has been adapted by subsequent overseas mail services for the British Empire ‚Äì a service operated privately albeit with a heavy Government subsidy. To begin with, Dummer submitted his expenses to the Postmaster General who passed them on to the Treasury. During the first year ¬£9,000 was impressed for the service, but the Treasury were so slow in paying that Dummer's finances could not stand the strain. In 1704 he was granted a salary as a Commissioner of the Navy, to be paid as from the date of the beginning of the service. In the following year a new contract was drawn up to run for at least three years, or five years if the war continued. Under this a monthly service was to be maintained by a fleet of five vessels; Dummer was to receive ¬£12,500 per annum, and was to be allowed to carry for his own profit 5 tons of freight on the outward journeys, and 10 tons on the homeward runs. In return he was to accept all risks to the ships and was responsible for replacements if they were lost or captured; further, he guaranteed that the Post Office would receive ¬£8,000 per annum from the mail and passengers carried. For this new contract five new ships were built: Queen Anne, Prince George, Jamaica, Barbadoes and Antegoe. Each of these vessels was of 200 tons, armed with 20 guns, and with two decks; they were also fitted with 24 oars apiece to enable them to escape from attacking vessels in the calms, often met with in the Caribbean. By 1707 Dummer realised that he could no longer maintain the service as long as the clause guaranteeing the ¬£8,000 income to the Crown remained in the contract. This resulted in a further contract being drawn up on 25 January 1708. Under this he was to continue the monthly service with five vessels; to supply stores and ammunition, and to be responsible for the payment of the crews; and to take all risks from the loss of ships. He was to be allowed ¬£12,000 a year during time of war, and ¬£8,000 in peacetime, together with all proceeds of cargo and passengers, whilst the revenue from the Mail was to go to the Crown. Even with this new contract, however, it was impossible to carry on the service indefinitely. Dummer had to borrow money on the security of future payments. By the end of 1711, with the return of the packet Martlett, the service came to an end. The loss of ships from enemy action during the War of the Spanish Succession and losses from storms, had left Dummer bankrupt. In nine years, Dummer had lost two packets at sea and had seven captured. His remaining seven packets were seized by creditors & the service lapsed. It was not until 1745 that the Post Office re-introduced a service to the West Indies, based on Dummer's original plans, in response to demands from merchants, due to the growth of British interests in sugar plantations. Shipbuilder for the Navy Dummer continued his association with the Royal Navy through his shipbuilding interests at Blackwall. In 1704 he presented to the Admiralty a model and a draught for a small vessel designed to \\"cruise on the coast of this Kingdom\\" and \\"to row with oars\\" as well as sail. On 7 March 1704, the Admiralty instructed the Navy Board to contract with Dummer to build two vessels to this design. These two sloops, HMS Ferret and HMS Weazle, were significantly greater in size and firepower than earlier unrated craft. These 128-ton vessels were the first sloops built to serve as effective warships, carrying eight minions and two falconets, subsequently replaced by a uniform armament of twelve 3-pounder guns. In 1709 Dummer also designed and built the small sixth rate HMS Swan by contract with the Navy Board, and in the same year they purchased from him a similar vessel which he was building on speculation ‚Äì the Sixth rate HMS Hind. The French captured Ferret in 1706, the Hind unfortunately stranded and wrecked off the Isle of Wight just two months after her launch in 1709, and the Weazle and Swan were sold in 1712. South Stoneham House South Stoneham House. In 1705, Dummer acquired the estate at South Stoneham, near Southampton from Giles Frampton and by 1708 South Stoneham House was completed, probably to the designs of the architect Nicholas Hawksmoor. Bankruptcy and death Dummer was declared bankrupt in February 1711, and although he was released from the Fleet Prison soon afterwards he was recommitted to the Fleet in April 1712. He died there at the end of April 1713 and was buried at St Andrew's, Holborn on 8 May 1713. After his death, the business at Sowley was bought from his creditor, the Duke of Montagu, by his brother, who ran the ironworks until 1716. In December 1713, a petition from his widow, Sarah, and his unmarried daughter, Jane, who were close to destitution, was presented to the Navy Board. The petition was heard by Dummer's former political mentor, Robert Harley as Secretary to the Lord High Treasurer. In the light of Dummer's earlier services as a civil engineer, they were granted a pension of ¬£150 per annum. In August 1716, Dummer's estate, including South Stoneham manor and property at Shedfield and Curdridge, were eventually sold by Jane to meet the claims of his creditors.

According to Fischer, Jesus Christ has already returned in the re-established Apostle office and there was no future second coming. Krebs removed Fischer from office. Fischer and his followers formed the Apostelamt Juda. On 2 May 1902 Fischer was ordained as the first Apostle of this church. After the death of Fischer in 1922 a group led by Hermann Kr≈´ger formed the breakaway group known as Apostelamt Simeon in Jacob's geslacht. In 1933 this group along with Apostelamt Juda was banned by the Nazi Germany regime of Adolf Hitler. The church was seen by the Nazi regime as a socialist group. The church's beliefs on prophecy also made it illegal. In 1947 the church regrouped under the leadership of Albert Trubach as Apostelamt Jesu Christi. From the early 1990s there was an ecumenical bond between Apostelamt Jesu Christi and the South African Old Apostolic Church.

It was a part of the Angat-Ipo-La Mesa water system. The reservoir supplies about 90 percent of raw water requirements for Metro Manila through the facilities of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System and it irrigates about 28,000 hectares of farmland in the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga.  Description  Angat Dam is located within the Angat Watershed Forest Reserve in Barangay San Lorenzo (Hilltop), Norzagaray, Bulacan. It supplies potable water to Metro Manila and powers a hydro-electric power plant. The dam is 131 meters high and impounds water from the Angat River that subsequently created the Angat Lake. Angat dam has a normal high water level of 210 meters, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa). It has three gates opening a total of 1.5 meters to gradually release water that had accumulated due to incessant rains during typhoons. In comparison, Ipo Dam, located downstream of Angat dam, has three gates and 100.8 meters as its normal high water level (NHWL). Ambuklao dam on the other hand, has two gates with NHWL at 752 meters. Binga dam which sits downstream from Ambuklao has three gates and NHWL at 575 meters. San Roque dam, which was receiving water from Ambuklao and Binga, has NHWL at 280 meters. Angat dam supplies potable water and energy to Metro Manila and nearby areas. Surrounded by lush greens, this place is also ideal for fishing, boating and hunting. http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=595861&publicationSubCategoryId;=63  History =Super Typhoon Emma (Welming) Emma hit Central Luzon in 1967, passing through the Angat Hydro-Electric Project and Dam of the National Power Corporation (NPC or Napocor) in Norzagaray, Bulacan. The heavy downpour caused the water in the Angat Dam reservoir to rise perilously to a danger height of 212 meters above sea level. Napocor opened the spillway gates to prevent an overflow of water from the dam. The Engineering Construction, Inc. (ECI), which had been doing construction work also in Norzagaray, suffered losses to its equipment and properties when the extraordinary large volume of water rushed out of the spillway gates and hit ECI's installations and construction works.http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/decisions.php?doctype=Decisions%20/%20Signed%20Resolutions&docid;=1263433532398567284http://jlp- law.com/blog/dam-operator-liable-for-negligence-in-flooding/ National Power Corporation vs. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. L-47379, 16 May 1988). Super Typhoon Rita (Kading) At about 2100 hours on October 26, 1978, during the height of the typhoon \\"KADING\\", NAPOCOR opened simultaneously all the three floodgates of the Angat Dam. NPC started to open the three floodgates simultaneously from 1 meter to 8 meters at 0100 hours of October 27, 1978, until all floodgates were opened to the maximum of 14 to 14.5 meters by 0600 hours of the same day. These acts of NPC resulted in the inundation of several towns in Bulacan near Angat Dam. Hardest-hit was Norzagaray, Bulacan. About 100 Garayenos died and million of pesos worth of properties (houses, farms, plants, working animals) were destroyed. Eleven civil suits were filed against the electric corporation in the Regional Trial Court of Malolos. NPC countered that there was very little opening of the spillways, ranging from 1 meter to 2 meters, but from midnight or from the first hours of October 27, 1978, the opening of all the three spillways started at 5 meters and swiftly went as far up as 14 meters. The court noted that had the opening of all the three spillways been made earlier and gradually, there would have been no need to open the same suddenly: \\"What made the situation worse was that the opening of the spillways was made at the unholy hours when residents were asleep. The plaintiffs all testified that they were never given any warning that the spillways would be opened to that extent.\\" Note The sum of both installed capacity.

Harold was the sixth child in a family of seven children. His father was John Nicholas Thornton, a tram conductor (born 1879 Lambton, NSW, died 1942 Enfield), and his mother was Anne (n√©e Burgess, born 1885 Enfield, died 1953 Enfield). Harold took up art at an early age and attended both the Orban School of Art and the Julian Ashton School of art. He was prolific and his art career spanned more than 60 years from traditional portraits and landscapes, to surrealist-type art, and some art commentators classify Harold's later works to be in the Naive style, however, Erica Kubic-Vegter, a Dutch art historian, has stated that Harold had many styles during his career and has classified his later bright-coloured \\"psychadelic\\" works as Magic Realism. But Harold himself would have rejected any classification of his art and was once quoted as saying ‚Äò‚Ä¶What do I paint: I have many styles, and change to suit the subject. My real painting is psychedelic. I don‚Äôt follow the old masters, no, I am one.‚Äô. He was an early Australian proponent of using bold, bright colours, and had an influence over artists such as Martin Sharp, Ken Done and Tim Gratton the body artist. Harold became well known in Amsterdam in the early 1970s. He painted a mural on the 1st cannabis coffeeshop, The Bulldog Nr.90, in Amsterdam which he completed in December 1975. The Bulldog's owner, Henk de Vries, went on to open a string of The Bulldog Coffeeshops thanks to the famous mural on Nr.90. Many of Harold's paintings adorn the Bulldog Hotel in Amsterdam.

It specialises in books on Aleister Crowley and his circle, magic, mysticism, eastern religions and alternative spirituality. Its earlier New York incarnation, The Weiser Bookshop, was described by Leslie A. Shepherd as \\"perhaps the most famous occult bookstore in the U.S.\\"Leslie Shepherd, Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology, 2nd Printing, Detroit, Michigan: Gale Research Company. Vol. 2, p. 978. Early years The original Samuel Weiser Bookstore was started in New York City's famous \\"Book Row\\" area by Samuel Weiser in 1926. It moved several times within the \\"Book Row\\" before relocating to 117 4th Avenue, where it remained for a number of decades.(Anon) International Directory For Antiquarian Booksellers 1958, Zurich: ILAB, 1958. To start with Samuel Weiser Books sold general used books, but with an emphasis on the occult and comparative religion. In 1949 Samuel Weiser was joined by his brother Ben who had worked with him for a few years in the 1930s. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s they increased Weiser Books' specialist focus on the occult at a time when many bookstores refused to handle such subjects. One of the customers of the shop was Karl Germer, successor to Aleister Crowley as head of the Ordo Templi Orientis. After Crowley's death, most of his papers and other possessions were shipped to Germer including the unbound sheets of the 1937 edition of his book The Equinox of the Gods. In 1955 Germer sold the sheets to Samuel Weiser who had them bound up in maroon cloth and sold through the shop. This was probably one of the first books to be published by Samuel Weiser ‚Äì although it retained the original O.T.O. title page and imprint.Details of the printing history of the Germer / Weiser issue of The Equinox of the Gods are given in Germer also sold Weiser a collection of the First Edition of Crowley's masterwork on the tarot, The Book of Thoth. Despite being leather bound, printed on handmade paper, and in an edition of only 200 copies signed by Crowley himself, interest in \\"the Beast\\" was low at the time and for nearly two decades copies could be purchased from the shop for $50 or less (as of 2009, they command thousands of dollars). Rising rents and urban change forced many of the bookstores out of \\"Book Row.\\" A number moved into the adjacent Broadway, with Weiser, whose stock had now grown to over a hundred thousand volumes, taking a premises at 845 Broadway. The new building had a huge basement, which the Weiser brothers crammed with books on all manner of subjects. After a heart attack forced Samuel Weiser into semi- retirement, Ben Weiser was joined by Samuel's son Donald.Marvin Mondlin and Roy Meador, \\"Book Row, an Anecdotal and Pictorial History of the Antiquarian Book Trade,\\" Foreword by Madeleine B. Stern. Carroll & Graf Publishers, New York, 2004, pp. 99-100. The 1960s onwards  Samuel Weiser had begun publishing in the mid-1950s, and through the late 1950s produced a small number of books under the Occult Research Press imprint before starting to publish under his own name. The development of the 1960s \\"counter-culture,\\" and the growth of popular interest in esotericism and Eastern religious and mystical traditions, allowed Ben and Donald Weiser to expand the company's publishing activities. They recruited many contemporary authors, such as Israel Regardie, who were customers. The shop's stock also provided them with rare and out-of-print books that they could reprint. The late 1960s saw the bookstore go through another move, this time into two floors at 734 Broadway, not far from Astor Place.Kenneth T. Jackson (Editor). \\"The Encyclopedia of New York City,\\" New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005. The move gave Donald Weiser, who now ran the business with the assistance of Fred Mendel, the chance to further increase their specialisation. In addition to used and rare books on the occult, Weiser Books, or \\"The Weiser Bookstore\\" as it was then known, also stocked new domestic and imported titles. The publishing side of the business was also expanded, and moved into its own premises at 625 Broadway.Marvin Mondlin and Roy Meador, \\"Book Row, an Anecdotal and Pictorial History of the Antiquarian Book Trade,\\" p. 100. By the early 1980s the costs of maintaining a number of businesses in New York City had grown increasingly difficult to sustain, and Donald Weiser moved Samuel Weiser Publishing and the new book distribution wing of the company to York, Maine. In 1985 he also moved the specialist rare books section of the company, now named Weiser Antiquarian Books, to York, where it shared a two storey warehouse with the publishing company's distribution centre. Much to the dismay of its many New York city customers, soaring city rents brought about the closure of the Broadway store in the early 1990s. Its huge stock of books was packed into shipping containers and moved to the new location in Maine, to be added to the stock of Weiser Antiquarian Books. In the year 2000 Donald Weiser sold the publishing division of the company. Its new owners renamed it Red Wheel / Weiser but kept its York premises until 2006, when they moved the publishing company's editorial department to San Francisco and its marketing department to Newburyport, Massachusetts. In 2005 Donald Weiser retired, and Weiser Antiquarian Books was purchased by its then-director Marilyn Rinn, and Australian writer and bookseller, Keith Richmond. The following year they moved the company to its current premises in Cape Neddick Maine: a one-time art gallery for American artist Walt Kuhn, which had more recently been the headquarters of Samuel Weiser Publishing. In 2007 they also began publishing under the Teitan Press imprint which was founded by Martin P. Starr and Frank Winston. Catalogs For decades the Weiser Bookstore issued printed catalogs that listed anywhere between a few hundred and several thousand items, with basic descriptions of the book's author, title, condition and price. The advent of the internet brought an end to these printed catalogs, and for some years Weiser Antiquarian Books only listed its books on various internet book- sites and directly on to its own website. In January 2006, Weiser Antiquarian Books began issuing a new series of on-line catalogs. Most of these catalogs are devoted to a specific author or theme. A large number have been devoted to the works of Aleister Crowley (in whom the store specialises), as well as authors including Dion Fortune, Israel Regardie, John Dee and Austin Osman Spare. In a number of cases ‚Äì such as their catalogs on Jack Parsons, Marcelo Ramos Motta and Kenneth Grant ‚Äì these are the first bookseller catalogs devoted specifically to these authors. Other catalogs have been devoted to specific journals - notably The Occult Review, The Inner Light, and Ambix, - and subjects such as alchemy, spiritualism, Hermetica, Hermetic Qabalah, magick, The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Rosicrucianism. Others have been devoted to books from specific collections: for example those of Helen Parsons Smith, Ray Burlingame, Edward Noel FitzGerald and Jean Michaud, or to collections of documents such as the Karl Germer / Reea Leffingwell correspondence or the C. F. Russell / Sydney Hamilton French / G‚à¥B‚à¥G‚à¥ archive. The catalogs contain bibliographical, historical and biographical information about the books offered for sale, and often detail previously unpublished manuscript and other material.

Despite its land area, the park is an important habitat for Sri Lankan elephant and endemic birds of Sri Lanka. The national park contains the reservoirs of Lahugala, Kitulana and Sengamuwa and they are ultimately empties to Heda Oya river. Originally it was designated as a wildlife sanctuary on July 1 of 1966. Then the protected area was upgraded to a national park on October 31 of 1980. Lahugala Kitulana is situated 318 km east of Colombo. Physical features Mean annual rainfall of the area is about . North east monsoon persist during the months November to December. Two dry periods last from May to October and January to March. The terrain of the park is flat with occasional rocky outcrops. Cultural importance Nearby Magul Maha Viharaya is supposed to have been built for the occasion of the marriage of King Kavan Tissa to princess Viharamahadevi. Later the Vihara believed to be offered to the Sangha community. Flora The national park's vegetation is classified into Sri Lanka dry-zone dry evergreen forests. Dominant grass species Sacciolepis interrupta is a main food source for elephants. Common floral species of the park include Drypetes sepiaria, Manilkara hexandra, Berrya cordifolia, Vitex pinnata, Chloroxylon swietenia, and the golden shower tree. Fauna This national park is traditionally used by elephants as a feeding ground. A herd of 150 individuals is attracted by Sacciolepis interrupta grass which is common around the Lahugala tank. Endemic toque macaque, tufted gray langur, sloth bear, golden jackal, rusty-spotted cat, fishing cat, Sri Lanka leopard, wild boar, Indian muntjac, Sri Lankan axis deer, Sri Lankan sambar deer, Indian pangolin and Indian hare are the other mammals found in the park. Many wetland birds found in Lahugala Kitulana include great white pelican, purple heron, painted stork, lesser adjutant, Anas spp., white-bellied sea eagle, grey-headed fish eagle, common kingfisher, stork-billed kingfisher, white-throated kingfisher. Spot-billed pelican, Asian openbill and woolly- necked stork are also recorded visiting the wetland. The last recorded sighting of knob-billed duck, now thought be extinct in Sri Lanka, occurred in here. Red-faced malkoha and Sri Lanka spurfowl are two endemic birds that reside in the park. Endemic Bufo atukoralei, Fejervarya limnocharis, Polypedates maculatus, Banded bull frog, and Microhyla rubra are among the amphibians of the national park. Python molurus, Rat snake, Chrysopelea spp. Boiga spp., Dryophis spp., and Russell's viper are among the notable reptiles. Melanochelys trijuga and Lissemys punctata are two freshwater turtles that inhabit in the tank of Lahugala. Endemic fish species Clarias brachysoma is also dwell in the tank. Conservation The Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Society is initiated a project to establish an electric fence to protect four villages adjacent to the southern boundary of the park. Poaching, logging, fuelwood collection, grazing are the prominent threats to the park. Development of lower Uva basin is a potential threat to the park as it would increase the cultivated area in turn it would isolate park and its elephant herd. A jungle corridor is being proposed to link the park with Gal Oya and Kumana National Parks. Environmentalists protested against a proposed canal which would have run within the park. They pointed that it is unlawful to allow the construction not just within the park but beyond one kilometre from the park as well.

Derivations of the pdf =Derivation of the pdf for one degree of freedom Let random variable Y be defined as Y = X2 where X has normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 (that is X ~ N(0,1)).

Then Y = X^2 \\\\sim \\\\chi^2_1. =Alternative proof directly using the change of variable formula= The change of variable formula (implicitly derived above), for a monotonic transformation y=g(x), is: :f_Y(y) = \\\\sum_{i} f_X(g_{i}^{-1}(y)) \\\\left \\\\frac{d g_{i}^{-1}(y)}{d y} \\\\right. In this case the change is not monotonic, because every value of \\\\scriptstyle Y has two corresponding values of \\\\scriptstyle X (one positive and negative). However, because of symmetry, both halves will transform identically, i.e. :f_Y(y) = 2f_X(g^{-1}(y)) \\\\left \\\\frac{d g^{-1}(y)}{d y} \\\\right. In this case, the transformation is: x = g^{-1}(y) = \\\\sqrt{y}, and its derivative is \\\\frac{d g^{-1}(y)}{d y} = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{y}} . So here: : f_Y(y) = 2\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}e^{-y/2} \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{y}} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi y}}e^{-y/2}. And one gets the chi-squared distribution, noting the property of the gamma function: \\\\Gamma(1/2)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}. Derivation of the pdf for two degrees of freedom There are several methods to derive chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. Here is one based on the distribution with 1 degree of freedom. Suppose that x and y are two independent variables satisfying x\\\\sim\\\\chi^2_1 and y\\\\sim\\\\chi^2_1, so that the probability density functions of x and y are respectively: : f(x)=\\\\frac{1}{2^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{2})}x^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}e^{-\\\\frac{x}{2}} and : f(y)=\\\\frac{1}{2^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{2})}y^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}e^{-\\\\frac{y}{2}} Simply, we can derive the joint distribution of x and y: : f(x,y)=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}(xy)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}e^{-\\\\frac{x+y}{2}} where \\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{2})^2 is replaced by \\\\pi. Further, let A=xy and B=x+y, we can get that: : x = \\\\frac{B+\\\\sqrt{B^2-4A}}{2} and : y = \\\\frac{B-\\\\sqrt{B^2-4A}}{2} or, inversely : x = \\\\frac{B-\\\\sqrt{B^2-4A}}{2} and : y = \\\\frac{B+\\\\sqrt{B^2-4A}}{2} Since the two variable change policies are symmetric, we take the upper one and multiply the result by 2. The Jacobian determinant can be calculated as: : \\\\operatorname{Jacobian}\\\\left( \\\\frac{x, y}{A, B} \\\\right) =\\\\begin{vmatrix} -(B^2-4A)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} & \\\\frac{1+B(B^2-4A)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}}{2} \\\\ (B^2-4A)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} & \\\\frac{1-B(B^2-4A)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}}{2} \\\\ \\\\end{vmatrix} = (B^2-4A)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} Now we can change f(x,y) to f(A,B): : f(A,B)=2\\\\times\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}A^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}e^{-\\\\frac{B}{2}}(B^2-4A)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} where the leading constant 2 is to take both the two variable change policies into account. Finally, we integrate out A to get the distribution of B, i.e. x+y: : f(B)=2\\\\times\\\\frac{e^{-\\\\frac{B}{2}}}{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{\\\\frac{B^2}{4}}A^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}(B^2-4A)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}dA Let A=\\\\frac{B^2}{4}\\\\sin^2(t), the equation can be changed to: : f(B)=2\\\\times\\\\frac{e^{-\\\\frac{B}{2}}}{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}} \\\\, dt So the result is: : f(B)=\\\\frac{e^{-\\\\frac{B}{2}}}{2}  Derivation of the pdf for k degrees of freedom  Consider the k samples x_i to represent a single point in a k-dimensional space. The chi square distribution for k degrees of freedom will then be given by: : P(Q) \\\\, dQ = \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{V} \\\\prod_{i=1}^k (N(x_i)\\\\,dx_i) = \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{V} \\\\frac{e^{-(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\\\cdots +x_k^2)/2}}{(2\\\\pi)^{k/2}}\\\\,dx_1\\\\,dx_2 \\\\cdots dx_k where N(x) is the standard normal distribution and \\\\mathcal{V} is that elemental shell volume at Q(x), which is proportional to the (k ‚àí 1)-dimensional surface in k-space for which : Q=\\\\sum_{i=1}^k x_i^2 It can be seen that this surface is the surface of a k-dimensional ball or, alternatively, an n-sphere where n = k - 1 with radius R=\\\\sqrt{Q}, and that the term in the exponent is simply expressed in terms of Q. Since it is a constant, it may be removed from inside the integral. : P(Q) \\\\, dQ = \\\\frac{e^{-Q/2}}{(2\\\\pi)^{k/2}} \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{V} dx_1\\\\,dx_2\\\\cdots dx_k The integral is now simply the surface area A of the (k ‚àí 1)-sphere times the infinitesimal thickness of the sphere which is :dR=\\\\frac{dQ}{2Q^{1/2}}. The area of a (k ‚àí 1)-sphere is: : A=\\\\frac{2R^{k-1}\\\\pi^{k/2}}{\\\\Gamma(k/2)} Substituting, realizing that \\\\Gamma(z+1)=z\\\\Gamma(z), and cancelling terms yields: : P(Q) \\\\, dQ = \\\\frac{e^{-Q/2}}{(2\\\\pi)^{k/2}}A\\\\,dR= \\\\frac{1}{2^{k/2}\\\\Gamma(k/2)}Q^{k/2-1}e^{-Q/2}\\\\,dQ Category:Article proofs ","title":"Proofs related to chi-squared distribution"},{"id":"24511001","text":"Shorty Hamilton (September 9, 1879 - March 7, 1925) was an American actor and silent film comedian who appeared in more than 80 films, mostly westerns, from 1909 to 1925. His birth name was William John Schroeder, and he was also known as \\"Jack Hamilton.\\" He had served in the United States Cavalry for several years and worked as a cowboy in Montana and Texas. He was best known for the \\"Adventures of Shorty\\" series of two-reel silent films that were released from 1912 to 1917. Early days Before becoming an actor, Hamilton served six years in the United States Cavalry and worked as a cowboy for five years in Montana and Texas. As an actor, he appeared in many of the western films produced by Thomas H. Ince, including The Great Smash. He was described as \\"an extremely likeable little chap who combines the wonderful riding, lassoing, cow-punching stunts of the true westerner with the polished, quick-wittedness of the New York society man.\\" \\"Adventures of Shorty\\" Hamilton was best known for the \\"Adventures of Shorty\\" series of two-reel comedies in which he starred from 1914 to 1917. There were more than 35 two-reel films featuring Hamilton as the \\"Shorty\\" character, a cowboy with a trained horse--his \\"remarkably intelligent horse, Beauty.\\" W. H. Clifford continued the series at his short-lived film company. Hamilton was not the only big talent associated with the \\"Shorty\\" pictures; the films were produced by Thomas H. Ince, many were written by the noted screenwriter C. Gardner Sullivan, (\\"The feature picture at the Bijou Theatre for the remainder of the week is the Broncho two- reel film, 'Shorty and Sherlock Holmes,' the latest release of the well known Shorty stories by C. Gardner Sullivan and Thomas H. Ince.\\") and the directors included Francis Ford. Aside from the trained horse, Hamilton's co-stars in the \\"Shorty\\" pictures included Enid Markey and Charles Ray. Personal life Hamilton's popularity drew attention to his personal life as well as his screen performances. In the fall of 1914, less than six months after the release of Shorty Escapes Matrimony, Hamilton married Ethel Spurgin. Hamilton met Spurgin, who was a fan of Hamilton's work, at an appearance at a movie theater in Venice, Los Angeles, California. The two married less than two months after they met. Later years and death The last of the \\"Adventures of Shorty\\" films was released in 1917. However, Hamilton continued to appear in western genre films. In March 1925, Hamilton died at age 45 when his automobile crashed into a steam shovel standing in a street in Hollywood.

In former times, they were included in the Osmeriformes (typical smelt and allies) as suborder Argentinoidei. That term refers only to the suborder of marine smelts and barreleyes in the classification used here, with the slickheads and allies being the Alepocephaloidei. These suborders were treated as superfamilies Argentinoidea and Alepocephaloidea, respectively, when the present group was still included in the Osmeriformes. They contain six or seven families with almost 60 genera and at least 228 species. A common name for the group is marine smelts and allies, but this is rather misleading since the \\"freshwater\\" smelts of the Osmeridae also live predominantly in the ocean.FishBase (2006): Order Osmeriformes. Version of 2006-OCT-09. Retrieved 2009-SEP-28. pp. 190-194 Description and ecology The Argentiniformes are smallish silvery or dark and generally bathypelagic ocean fishes. Some Argentinoidei have an adipose fin, which is - unusually for Protacanthopterygii to which they belong - missing in the rest of the order. The dorsal fin is located in the second half of the body. They have a physoclistous gas bladder or lack it entirely; teeth are absent in almost all. The hypaxial muscle is unusually extended to forward at its upper end and attaches to the neurocranium below the spine, perhaps to snap the upper part of the skull down when catching prey. The primordial ligament attaches posteriorly on the upper surface of the coronoid process. The autopalatine is peculiarly expanded to above and below at its caudal end, and like in some Otocephala, the caudal part of the mesethmoid appears compressed when seen from above. As in many other teleosts, the autopterotic and dermopterotic bones are not fused together. The most distinctive characteristic, however, is the crumenal organ, also called epibranchial organ. This consists of the additional cartilage and gill rakers on the fifth ceratobranchial, which is found in other teleosts, too, but not as well- developed as in the present order. Systematics Opisthoproctus soleatus (Argentinoidea: Opisthoproctidae). This image is drawn from a specimen brought to the surface. In a live specimen the membrane over its head would form a transparent dome. The treatment of the Argentiniformes as distinct order follows the discovery that they are by no means as closely related to the Osmeriformes as was long believed. In fact, they may actually be the most basal lineage of the living Protacanthopterygii. If this is so, it would probably require either inclusion of the supposed superorders \\"Cyclosquamata\\" and \\"Stenopterygii\\" in the Protacanthopterygii, or if the unranked clade name Euteleostei is used for this entire group restricting the Protacanthopterygii to the Osmeriformes and either Esociformes or Salmoniformes and establishing a monotypic superorder for the other of the two latter orders. Given the reluctance of modern zoologists to establish monotypic taxa if not absolutely necessary, the former treatment is probably preferable. The former classification of the Argentiniformes is: * Suborder Alepocephaloidei (moved to the cohort Otocephala as Alepocephaliformes) ** Family Alepocephalidae (typical slickheads) (includes Bathylaconidae; Leptochilichthyidae) ** Family Platytroctidae (including Searsiidae) * Suborder Argentinoidei ** Family Argentinidae (herring smelts) ** Family Bathylagidae (deep-sea smelts) ** Family Microstomatidae (pencil smelts) ** Family Opisthoproctidae (barreleyes) A fossil family that might belong in this order are the Pattersonellidae.

It stars Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra as two suicidal strangers who meet and make a pact to commit suicide in twenty days on New Year's Eve. In the interim, the couple fulfil their personal wishes and eventually fall in love. Vishal-Shekhar composed the soundtrack, with lyrics by various artists. Wanting to make an unusual romance film, Anand struggled to find unconventional ideas while he was writing. Then his wife Mamta came up with the core narrative of the film, which excited him and changed his perspective. Anand approached novelist Advaita Kala who developed the story into a feature-length script, and later co-wrote the screenplay with him. Principal photography was done entirely in New York City, Las Vegas and San Francisco. The film was released on 1 October 2010 to mixed critical reviews. Reviewers praised the lead performances, music and cinematography, but were critical of the film's screenplay and pace. Made on a production and marketing budget of 380 million, Anjaana Anjaani, grossed 685 million making it a box office success. Vishal-Shekhar were nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director for the film's soundtrack. Plot Akash (Ranbir Kapoor) lives in New York City; he has bankrupted his company and is in need of $12 million for paying the shareholders, but is unable to obtain a loan due to a stock market crash. He decides to jump off the George Washington Bridge. He meets Kiara (Priyanka Chopra), from San Francisco, who is also suicidal after catching her fianc√© Kunal (Zayed Khan) cheating on her. Akash and Kiara attempt to kill themselves, but are prevented from doing so by the Coast Guard. Still suicidal, Akash deliberately allows himself to be hit by a car, and Kiara falls on the bridge and breaks her neck. Their suicide attempts are unsuccessful, and they end up in hospital together. When they are discharged, Kiara takes Akash to her apartment because his house has been seized by the bank. The pair try to kill themselves five times, failing each time. Eventually, they make a pact to end their lives on 31 December 2009. With 20 days left before their deadline, they decide to fulfill their unrealised wishes and begin a journey together. Kiara helps Akash find a date and shares with him how Kunal cheated on her. The next day, Akash cleans Kiara's messy apartment. Though he cannot swim, Akash is forced to fulfil Kiara's wish to swim in the cold Atlantic Ocean. However, at sea Kiara falls overboard and Akash rescues her. Their yacht drifts away, stranding them. As the two slowly succumb to hypothermia, Kiara continues telling her story to Akash. They are rescued again by the Coast Guard officer who intervened on the bridge. After returning to land, Kiara's depression continues. She attempts to kill herself by drinking bleach and is rushed to hospital. After she is discharged, Akash realises his love for her, and tries everything to make her happy. The two venture to Las Vegas, as Akash has never gone on a holiday, and they end up in bed together. Kiara tells Akash that she still loves Kunal. Akash insists that she move back in with her parents and give Kunal a second chance. Akash moves in with his friend and colleague (Joy Sengupta), and plans to return to India on the night of 31 December to start afresh. Akash attends the bank settlement and reconciles with several friends with whom he had fallen out, as well as with his estranged father. Meanwhile, Kiara cannot stop thinking about Akash, and on the 31st she realises that she has fallen for him. Kunal discovers this and drops Kiara off at the airport. She reaches the bridge, but finds herself alone, believing she will never see Akash again. Just then he arrives. The pair go out to sea to die. Akash throws a beer bottle with a note in it, which Kiara gets and reads before he proposes to her. Surprised, she accepts, and the couple share a kiss while the Coast Guard rescues them. As the credits roll, Akash and Kiara are shown two years later, married with their 2 year old son. THE END Cast The cast is listed below: * Ranbir Kapoor as Akash * Priyanka Chopra as Kiara * Zayed Khan as Kunal Nanda (Cameo) * Vishal Malhotra as Gaurav * Joy Sengupta as Deven * Pooja Kumar as Peshto * Tanvi Azmi as the Doctor * Kumar Pallana as the Coast Guard * Nakul Kamte as Kiara's dad * Sucheta Khanna as Sapna, Deven's wife Production=Development After three romantic comedies, Siddharth Anand wanted his next film to be a romance, yet different from the usual films which were being made at the time. Anand felt he had run out of plot ideas, believing he was writing just \\"another story\\". His wife Mamta then came up with the core narrative concept about \\"two suicidal strangers meeting and falling in the love\\". Anand revealed that this changed his viewpoint, saying: \\"It was a scene that got me completely excited and we started writing immediately. It's a scene that dictates the story.\\" Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were in talks to star together in another film by Siddharth Anand and Sajid Nadiadwala, which did not happen. Anand then approached novelist Advaita Kala to develop the story into a feature-length script. Although a bit hesitant, she accepted the offer. Intrigued by the premise of the story, Kala started sketching the characters over the next few days, and began writing the script, which she found very different from writing novels. Anand helped her understand the process of writing screenplays and co-wrote with her. Kala wrote the first draft, approaching it like writing a book, and sent it as chapters to Anand, saying: \\"Writing a screenplay can also be a lonely process like writing a novel, but along the way when others get involved, it becomes a fun collaborative effort.\\" In an interview with the Deccan Herald, Anand talked about how the American sitcom Friends influenced the film's two characters revealing he wanted viewers to respond to Akash and Kiara in a similar way. He said: \\"I remember when I watched Friends I wanted to meet and know every character. That's how I want audiences to feel about Ranbir and Priyanka.\\" He also wanted the two to resonate with the audience the way the characters in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) did. In another interview discussing the film, Anand revealed that he wanted to make it different from his earlier films, aiming for it to be a \\"subdued romance,\\" which is not sexy. He said: \\"Everyone is going to be covered up in scarf's and mufflers and over coats and boots. This is a rare instance that you‚Äôll see Indian actors dressed full up without skin show.\\"(sic) In September 2009, it was announced that Sajid Nadiadwala would produce the film as he was highly impressed by the script. Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were the original choice for the film and their casting was confirmed by Anand in August 2009. After Chopra had starred earlier in Nadiadwala's Mujhse Shaadi Karogi in 2004, both had wanted to work together again, but nothing had materialised. Much later, Nadiadwala reached out to her to discuss a film he was developing with Anand and Kapoor. Chopra met Anand to discuss the script, but the project did not work out. Later when Nadiadwala approached her again with the script of Anjaana Anjaani, Chopra accepted the role. Manish Malhotra designed Chopra's clothes; Mamta Aanand designed Kapoor's. Salim Sulaiman composed the background score, while Rameshwar S. Bhagat edited the film. Filming The film's opening suicide attempt scene features the two characters at the Golden Gate Bridge. Principal photography began in New York City in late December 2009. The setting of the film required filming in winter during the festive season of Christmas leading up to New Year's Eve. Ravi K. Chandran handled the cinematography, while Sharmishtha Roy handled the film's production design. Filming was done in various locations in New York City, Las Vegas and San Francisco. Anand wanted to capture the distinct flavour of each city. Anand selected the cities to augment the characters' backgrounds. He chose New York city for Kapoor's character Akash. San Francisco was chosen to depict Chopra's character Kiara as he thought it was \\"the right backdrop to highlight her life and character\\". Anand described \\"Blush\\", the car driven by Chopra's character, as the film's third character as it is featured extensively. After going through several car options, he chose a vintage red 1963 ford falcon Sprint, which was later purchased especially for the film as Anand thought the car should represent all of Kiara's attributes. This allowed the art director to modify the car's interior with a lot of detailing to suit Kiara's character. The ice-skating scenes were filmed at Wollman Rink in Central Park, requiring the rink to close to the public for three consecutive days. Some scenes with the leads were also shot at Cafe Lalo, the same restaurant where When Harry Met Sally... (1989) was shot. The film was also shot at the Rockfeller Center. The producers had earlier scouted for a public bridge in India that they could use for four days, but due to the 2008 Mumbai attacks obtaining permission from a local government was difficult. The search ended in Kuala Lumpur, where a scene of Kiara and Akash attempting suicide was shot. The opening suicide attempt sequence was filmed at the Golden Gate Bridge. Several scenes were shot in Nevada, Las Vegas. Additional filming was done in Malaysia and Thailand. Ahmed Khan choreographed the songs. In June 2010, it was announced that a new song would be shot for the film. Shooting ended in July 2010 after filming for the club track was completed. In September 2010, a promotional video for the remix ballad version of \\"Tujhe Bula Diya\\" was shot in Film City, Mumbai. Soundtrack The soundtrack was composed by the duo Vishal‚ÄìShekhar and consists of nine compositions ‚Äì seven original, and a remix and an unplugged version of two original songs. The lyrics are written by: Neelesh Misra, Vishal Dadlani, Shekhar Ravjiani, Amitabh Bhattacharya, Anvita Dutt Guptan, Kumaar, Kausar Munir and Irshad Kamil. The vocals were performed by: Nikhil D'Souza, Monali Thakur, Lucky Ali, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Shekhar Ravjiani, Caralisa Monteiro, Mohit Chauhan, Shruti Pathak, Vishal Dadlani, Shilpa Rao and Abhijit Vaghani. The album was released on 20 August 2010 by T-Series. The soundtrack received acclaim from critics, who praised the fresh compositions, and considered it to be Vishal-Shekhar's best soundtrack to date. Joginder Tuteja gave a rating of 4 out of 5, calling it \\"fantastic,\\" writing: \\"This one has a classy touch all through with a mix of club tracks and soulful songs that rock the show in a big way [...] this is their best work till date.\\" The Hindustan Times gave it another positive review, calling it a \\"complete Bollywood album\\". Giving a rating of 8.5 out of 10, Planet Bollywood thought that \\"the musical duo have genuinely struck gold,\\" writing: \\"The soundtrack has the right blend of fun, youthfulness, romance, and melancholy. Terrific sound design, superb arrangement and remarkable mixing of the songs in the soundtrack give an international feel.\\" The BBC also praised the album noting that the music duo have produced a gem. Release Because Kapoor and Chopra were starring together for the first time, Anjaana Anjaani was one of the most anticipated films of the year. Exclusive stills from the film were released to the media on 4 October 2010. Chopra released a one- minute teaser trailer on 6 August 2010 on her Twitter account. It received positive feedback from critics and audiences, many calling it promising. The Indian Express wrote: \\"In a single minute, it has pretty much managed to convey the fun mood of this Sajid Nadiadwala production which appears to come with a good mix of a new storyline, fresh new pairing, catchy music, high production values and a distinct touch of director Siddharth Anand.\\" Following the teaser release the first trailer appeared on 9 August 2010. The film's first song was released around the same time. Anjaana Anjaani film was initially slated to release on 24 September 2010. It was postponed by one week, just four days before the expected date because this would coincide with the controversial Ayodhya dispute verdict, which many anticipated would be disputed and cause chaos in the country. Trade experts were against postponing the film, and questioned Nadiadwala's decision, as the government had already taken precautionary measures with the Commonwealth Games around the corner. They also felt that the postponement would send mixed signals and confuse viewers as the promotional campaign centred around the 25 September release. Additionally, the film would lose the advantage of being the only new release. Changing the release date would mean Anjaana Anjaani would clash with the science fiction film Enthiran, which might affect the film's box-office performance. Still, the film was postponed to 1 October 2010. Later, the Ayodhya verdict was itself postponed to three days before the film's new release date. Industry insiders started speculating again about the film's release being postponed by another week, causing rumours to spread in the media. However, Sajid Nadiadwla confirmed that the news was false and the film was releasing on 1 October 2010. Made on a production and marketing budget of 380 million, the film immediately recovered 430 million, slightly more than its entire budget, before its release. This included 220 million from satellite rights, 80 million from music rights, and 130 million from distribution sales in territories other than Mumbai and Delhi, where the film was distributed directly by Eros. Bollywood Hungama noted that \\"the revenue generated from these territories, besides Home Video, will add to the profits of the film\\". The film's box office revenue on its opening day was 80 million. Anjaana Anjaani made over 257 million at the domestic box office and a further 1.7 million from overseas, for a worldwide opening weekend of over 382 million. During its theatrical run, the film grossed over 544 million in India, and over 3.1 million in the overseas market, for a total of 685 million. The film was a box office success. Distributed by Eros International, Anjaana Anjaani was released on DVD on 16 November 2010 in all regions on a single NTSC-format disc. The film's Video CD was released at the same time. A two-disc DVD edition was also released later, which included a poster autographed by Kapoor and Chopra. Critical reception Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5, calling it \\"a must-see for its interpretation of modern-day romance... Anjaana Anjaani is an unpretentious romantic saga that revels in the exuberance of newly found love.\\" He also broadly praised the acting, styling and cinematography, writing: \\"The film bears a magnificent look all through and the panoramic and exotic locales of America only make every frame stand out.\\" Daily News and Analysis gave it a rating of 3.5 out of 5, saying that it stood apart from \\"other done-to-death rom-coms in Hindi cinema in the sheer exclusivity of its screenplay and the way the subject is developed ... Here, at last, is a romantic comedy from Bollywood that actually does what rom-coms are supposed to do. Anjaana Anjaani tugs at your heartstrings while at the same time tickling your funny bone.\\" It also praised Chopra's performance as \\"engagingly brilliant\\". The Times of India gave the film a score of 3 out of 5, praising the lead pair and their chemistry as \\"vibrant, spontaneous, and a finely nuanced performance\\". However, it criticised the script and narrative for being trite, saying that \\"all it promises is some fun moments, a peppy music score by Vishal-Shekhar, [and] alluring performances by Ranbir and Priyanka\\". Subhash K. Jha wrote another positive review, saying that the film \\"sets off a tender saucy engaging trip. It somewhere loses its way. But still gets to its targeted destination because of the lead players who appear to know all the signposts and U-turns.\\" He particularly cited Chopra's performance as redeeming the film's flaws, noting that she provided a strong match to Kapoor's talent. Sarita Tanwar of Mid Day gave a rating of 3 out of 5, noting that although the film might not be \\"a complicated love story, it's still heartfelt and even heartbreaking at times ... A film of this kind is largely dependent on the screenplay and the chemistry between the lead pair. That's what makes [it] unique in its own way and rather different from what you've seen in the year so far.\\" Sonia Chopra from Sify also scored the movie 3 out of 5, noting that the characters were \\"written with an over-the-top quirky edge which adds to the fun\\". She also praised the lead pair's performance writing that \\"Ranbir Kapoor is suitably restrained and, at times, in keeping with his reticent character, often overshadowed by Priyanka's exuberance. Priyanka Chopra maintains her cool, effortless acting style and her comic timing is quite a revelation. Together, the pair is eminently watchable, balancing each other's dispositions nicely.\\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 2.5 out of 5, complimenting the lead performers who \\"play well together\\", but are forced to \\"boost a limp story.\\" India Today also scored it 2.5 out of 5, calling it \\"a pastiche of a pastiche ... The comedy is restricted to usual [...] jokes that find their way into most Bollywood comedies.\\" Writing for NDTV, Anupama Chopra gave the film 2 out of 5, criticising the slow screenplay and artificial characters who \\"are supposed to be unemployed, lonely, and desperately sad, but they always look like they've stepped out of the pages of a fashion magazine. Which could have been overlooked if there was any depth in their angst, but these two seem like spoilt kids playing suicide-suicide.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 panned the film, calling it \\"deathly boring [and] a challenge to sit through for two reasons in particular ‚Äì the film has no script to speak of, and the characters are hard to sympathize with. It lacks in terms of interesting plot and consistent characterization\\".

Bill C-398 aimed to prohibit various forms of discrimination by telecommunications service providers. \\"Network management practices that favour, degrade or prioritize any content, application or service transmitted over a broadband network based on its source, ownership, destination or type\\" are specifically prohibited, subject to certain exceptions. Telecommunications Service providers may use reasonable management practices in order to alleviate extraordinary congestion, may prioritize emergency communications, and assure the security of computers and networks in a reasonable manner. ISPs, according to the proposed Bill, would also be allowed to charge users on a usage-based basis as well as offer directly to users consumer protection services that may discriminate, provided notice is given to users as well as a possibility to opt-out. The Bill would also prohibit telecommunications service providers to hamper foreign device attachment to their networks provided the device would neither damage nor degrade the network. Telecommunications service providers would furthermore be obligated to render available to users at all time information about the speed, limitations and management practices that are in effect. History The Bill is a re- submitted version of Bill C-552 which was introduced one day after 300 protesters came to Parliament in May 2008. The Net Neutrality movement in Canada had accelerated since telecom providers Bell Canada and Rogers were found to have throttled their users P2P traffic. Liberal MP David McGuinty had followed closely on the heels of Mr. Angus' first private member initiative with a private Bill of his own, C-555.

Life Wulfhild was born in 1020 as the only legitimate child of King Olaf II of Norway and his wife Astrid Olofsdotter of Sweden. Her illegitimate half-brother was Magnus the Good. She was likely born and raised in Sarpsborg. In 1028, she accompanied her parents to Vestlandet, and in 1029, she left Norway for Sweden with them. It is not determined whether she followed her father and half-brother on their trip to Russia or remained in Sweden with her mother, but she did live in Sweden between the death of her father in 1030 until she returned with her half-brother Magnus to Norway in 1035, when he became king. Wulfhild is described as a beauty, and is thought to have been greatly respected as the only legitimate child of her father and daughter of a saint. On 10 November 1042, she was married to Ordulf, son of Bernard II, Duke of Saxony. This marriage was supposed to strengthen the alliance between Saxony and Denmark; her half-brother expected the support of her consort to strengthen his position in Denmark by fighting the Wends. The marriage ceremony was celebrated in Schleswig during these political negotiations, officiated by the archbishops of Schleswig and Bremen. Her husband did remain loyal to the alliance, but the information about Wulfhild is limited and nothing is known about any of her opinions. Wulfhild and Ordulf had a son, Magnus, Duke of Saxony.

It was built in 1906 and is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 30781. (Click on \\"Technische gegevens\\" to view.) History This mill was built in 1857 for Hermannus Beins, who died in 1861. It was originally a barley mill and had Patent sails. In 1862 the mill was in the ownership of Egge Dijkhuizen, passing to Thijs Mulder and then the Hoff brothers. They sold the mill in 1873 to A de Vries for ∆í9,000 on the condition that a post mill he owned which stood on the road to Een was demolished. (Click on \\"Geschiedenis\\" to view.) The mill was sold in 1878 to Ludernus Warmelts and passed to his son Hendrik Warmolts. During their ownership the mill was converted to a corn mill. In 1935, one pair of Patent sails was replaced with a pair of Bilau sails, although the stock soon broke. In 1937, the mill was fitted with four new Bilau sails by millwrights Fabrikaat Wijnveen of Voorthuizen, Gelderland. In 1943, the sails were damaged by gunfire from fighter aircraft. They were repaired as the mill was needed to produce flour to feed the villagers of Norg. In 1962, owner Jan Snijders restored the mill. A further restoration of the then nameless mill took place in 1982, during which the shed which formerly housed an engine was demolished. By the 1990s the mill was again in need of repairs. It turned for the last time on 24 August 1996 before a further restoration was undertaken. In 1997 the mill was bought by Gemeente Norg and resold to Molenstichting Drenthe (English: Drenthe Mills Society). Restoration to full working order was completed in 2000. This is the only windmill in the Netherlands fitted with Bilau sails. Description De Hoop is what the Dutch describe as an \\"achtkante stellingmolen\\". It is a two-storey smock mill on a three-storey brick base. The stage is at second-floor level, above ground level. The smock and cap are clad in Dakleer. The mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. The four Bilau sails have a span of are carried in a cast-iron windshaft, which was cast by Nederlandse Stoomboot Maatschappij, Fyenoord in 1844. The windshaft was originally cast solid and had to be bored through to take Patent sails at a later date. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel, which has 62 cogs. The brake wheel drives the wallower (32 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft the great spur wheel, which has 80 cogs, drives the diameter French Burr millstones via a lantern pinion stone nut which has 24 staves.

The regiment's first action was during the Battle of Sholinghur in the Second Anglo-Mysore War.

In 1906 the regiment consisted of four companies of Madrassi Musselmans, one of Telegau and one combining Madras Christians and Dadbers. All but two of their officers had been transferred from other Madras units which were in the process of being disbanded. The 80th Carnatic carried four battle honours on its regimental flag and had the unusual distinction of carrying an extra honorary colour to commemorate the capture of an enemy flag during the 18th century. During World War I they served in the Mesopotamia Campaign and a second battalion the 2/80th was formed in the Southern Brigade of the 9th (Secunderabad) Division in October 1918, and transferred to the Secunderabad Bde in December 1918.

From the 12th century it was the original residence of the Counts of Sponheim. Significant portions of the castle remain standing. Site The castle stands on a crag, approximately 250 meters long, around which the Ellerbach stream, a tributary of the Nahe, flows on the south and east sides. The ruin is on the peak of the crag, which is roughly 150 meters high.  History  Remnants of the watchtower The castle was probably already built in the 11th century and is first mentioned in two documents of 1127. In the 12th century it was extended and became the residence of the Counts of Sponheim. Upon the partition of the county in the early 13th century, the castle lost its importance, becoming the seat of comital ministeriales. The existence of a castle chapel is documented in an indulgence dated 1300. When the ruling male line of the Rhenish branch of the House of Sponheim became extinct in 1437, the castle became a joint jurisdiction of the Margraves of Baden and the Counts of Veldenz, whose territories were inherited by Count Palatine Frederick I of Simmern in 1444 and held by the House of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. In the Thirty Years' War the castle was besieged by Spanish troops under Ambrogio Spinola in 1620, which may have caused some destruction. Layout Within a ring wall, the castle comprised a residential section, a round tower, and a strongly fortified rectangular keep, provided for habitation purposes with privy, enlarged windows, and fireplaces. The keep was constructed of rough-hewn stone and dates roughly to the mid-12th century. Other towers with rough-hewn masonry are found only south of the River Nahe.

History The castle or fortress was built in the second half of the 12th century by the Spanheim ministeriales the knights Billichgr√§tz (). The noble Henrik Polhograjski was listed as the owner of the castle (or fort) of Pilchgrez in 1261. In 1360 half of the castle was obtained by count Otto of Ortenburg, and in the mid-14th century its owners were relatives of the Polhograjskis, the noble house of Gall. In 1364, Ulrik Polhograjski and his uncle Konrad Gall sold the castle and lordship to the counts of Celje. After the extinction of the house of Celje with the death of Ulrik II of Celje in 1456, the Polhov Gradec lordship passed to the Habsburgs. Around 1470, the Polhov Gradec line also became extinct, and the Habsburgs gave the estate in ducal fief to a succession of tenants, including the knights Luegger, Andrej the noble Gall (until 1504) and Gaspar the noble Lamberg. The castle was damaged by the earthquakes of 1348 and 1511, but its death blow was struck in 1514 when it was thoroughly wrecked during a major peasant revolt, after which the site was abandoned and the lordship transferred to the lower castle, Polhov Gradec Manor (). At the site of the old castle an octagonal gloriette was later built, which Countess Antonija Blagaj turned into a chapel in 1853, adding 14 shrines for the Stations of the Cross to it to create a Calvary.Old Castle‚ÄìCalvary Hill References Category:Castles in Upper Carniola Category:Ruined castles in Slovenia ","title":"Polhov Gradec Castle"},{"id":"24511494","text":"Logik may refer to: * LoGIK, the GIK Institute Clock Tower in Topi, Pakistan * Logik (book), an 1890 book by Alois H√∂fler and Alexius Meinong * Logik (brand), an electronics brand of Dixons Retail  See also  * Logic (disambiguation) ","title":"Logik"},{"id":"24511511","text":"Noisia (stylised as NOISIŒõ; \\"VISION\\" turned upside down) is a Dutch electronic music trio consisting of members Nik Roos, Martijn van Sonderen and Thijs de Vlieger from Groningen, Netherlands.IMO Records \\"Noisia Biography\\", IMO Records, London, 21 October 2011.

A compromis is made after a dispute has already arisen, rather than before. (This is in contrast to provisions in existing treaties or protocols made before the dispute arose). The compromis identifies a neutral third party - the arbitrator or arbitral tribunal - or specifies the manner of appointment. The compromis often sets forth the precise question or questions to be decided; the arbitral rules of procedure; the seat of the tribunal; the languages to be used in the proceeding; the applicable law; and the payment of costs. A compromis to submit a dispute to arbitration can be made ad hoc by two or more states, or it can be on the basis of a reciprocal declaration made under the Statute of the International Court of Justice. Article 36(2) of the Statute of the ICJ provides that: \\"The states parties to the present Statute may at any time declare that they recognize as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement, in relation to any other state accepting the same obligation, the jurisdiction of the Court in all legal disputes concerning: a. the interpretation of a treaty; b. any question of international law; c. the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an international obligation; d. the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of an international obligation.\\" Article 36(3) provides that: \\"The declarations referred to above may be made unconditionally or on condition of reciprocity on the part of several or certain states, or for a certain time.\\"Statute of the International Court of Justice, art. 36 . Compromis have been used for many years. Treaties reported by Jean Dumont, a compiler of early treaties, show among many others an 1176/77 dispute between Castile and Navarra over certain territories and castles in Spain was submitted to King Henry II of England for resolution; an 1177 compromis and 1180 compromis between Henry II of England and Philip II of France submitted a dispute concerning Auvergne and other territories to arbitration by three bishops and barons on either side; and a June 1298 compromis submitted to Pope Boniface VIII a dispute between Edward I of England and Philip IV of France over English fiefs in France.J. H. W. Verzijl, International Law in Historical Perspective, Part VIII: Inter-State Disputes and Their Settlement (1976), pp. 207-13. An example of a modern compromis is the 1996 Special Agreement between Botswana and Namibia, which referred the two countries' dispute over Sedudu (Kasikili) island to the ICJ for resolution. The ICJ decided the Case concerning Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia) in 1999, ruling for Botswana.Case concerning Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), ICJ Judgment of 13 December 1999 . A compromis may also be used to submit international investment or trade disputes to arbitration.Christopher Dugan et al., Investor-State Arbitration (2008), Oxford University Press, 242-46.

ActionShot photograph of a snowboarder. ActionShot is a method of capturing an object in action and displaying it in a single image with multiple sequential appearances of the object. Additional names: action synopsis, motion synopsis, panoramic video synopsis, dynamic still, synopsis mosaic, stromotion.  Background  There are many methods for capturing panoramic images, some being fully manual or semi-automatic, and others completely automatic. However, the majority of these methods are for creating panoramic photos of a static landscape. In contrast, the capture of a dynamic scene ‚Äî i.e. recording the motion of a moving object ‚Äî is typically done by video recording. ActionShot is a method that combines elements of both panoramic and video photography to create panoramic photos of dynamic scenes that take place over a wide-angle area. This involves capturing a moving object (e.g. a person running, riding a bicycle or skiing) and depicting multiple instances of this object over a single panoramic background.  Methods = Hardware  Stroboscopes have been used to create static images of an action. The moving object is illuminated by the periodic light flashes generated by the stroboscope and is shot by a stills camera using a long exposure. This results in a photograph that displays multiple images of the object along its path. ActionShot photography is now available as part of camera application on Samsung Android Galaxy Premium Devices (Samsung Galaxy S and Samsung Galaxy S2) or by downloading the Nokia Smartcam app on the Microsoft Lumia Phones  Manual image editing  To create a dynamic panoramic image manually, a photographer needs to take several shots or still frames from a high-resolution video of a moving object and then combine them together using manual image registration, followed by manual image stitching. Image editing programs can assist in this process.Kaan Kiran , Composing an Action Sequence Shot. DIYPhotography.net Photography and Studio Lighting.  Automatic image processing  Early digital image processing methods created a \\"synopsis mosaic\\" by building a panoramic image a video sequence where higher weights were assigned to the moving objects.M.

Signal Processing: Image Communication, special issue on Image and Video Semantics: Processing, Analysis, and Application, Vol. 8, No. 4, May 1996. However, good image registration and stitching alone were not sufficient for creating a realistic image, because if the moving object overlaps itself, the combined result seems highly unnatural.Dynamic still examples This in order to create eye-catching synopsis still images, and even videos, the moving objects are required not to overlap in the composed result.Y.Pritch, A.Rav-Acha, S.Peleg.

In 2000, it was also discovered in Florida.C. citricola web C. citricola web detail Although it is in the family commonly called Orb Web Spiders, this spider does not build orb webs and their webs are considered atypical and has been described as having a mesh-like, horizontal appearance. The difference in their web silk can be explained by unique physiological changes to their spinning apparatuses. The spiders have developed unique prey- capturing techniques which utilize their atypical webs. These spiders can be social, and their webs are often built in large matrices next to one another. These spiders are most active at night, preferring to carry out only necessary tasks during the day. During the day, they primarily remain idle and try to stay out of sight from predators. At night, they conduct most of their foraging and prey capture. They may also have to ward off other spiders in the colony that may try and claims their orb-webs. C. citricola's color may vary greatly; whereas many sport a black and white pattern, others are brown, males sometimes appear black. Body length in females normally reaches 10 mm, with males only 3 mm long. Cyrtophora citricola's exhibit high rates of sexual cannibalism, in that they eat their male partners after mating. The females' egg sacs are flattened and elliptical shaped and up to ten egg sacs can be produced by a female.  Description  Cyrtophora citricola spiders are a medium brown color, though may display darker brown spots on the abdomen. In Florida specifically, male spiders are black and females vary in their coloring and can camouflage in their webs. Cyrtophora citricola male and female spiders exhibit sexual dimorphism, with the male spiders (3mm in length) being significantly smaller than the female spiders (10mm in length). Uniquely, Cyrtophora citricola exhibit a horizontal bifurcation at the posterior abdomen. It also is distinguishable from its other relatives by its two pairs of dorsal tubercles and its posterior tubercles pair. Larger spiders are typically dominant over smaller spiders. The females have been found to exhibit white hairs. The spiders have seven denticles. The opisthosoma has two dorsal pairs of protuberances and two posterior lobes. Like others in the Cyrtophora family, their 2nd, 3rd, and 4th legs have a shorter combined patella and tibia length than femurs within the same legs. Additionally, they share the same bent-back eye pattern: a typical family defining trait. They differ from the Manogea genus of orb-web spiders due to their broader cephalic structures. They are most active from the middle of summer to the beginning of fall. Adults are seen and mate between June and September. These spiders are unique compared to their close relatives due to their widespread habitation. Most of their close relatives are concentrated in specific parts of the world. However, their introduction to the Americas has caused many problems. They are now becoming increasingly common in agricultural and urban spaces, damaging farm operations. Currently, there are active efforts to remove these spiders as their webs are known to damage flora.  Habitat and Distribution  Cyrtophora citricola can be found in Asia, Africa, Australia, Costa Rica, Hispaniola, Colombia, and the warmer parts of Europe. These spiders live in a wide range of environments, from plants and trees to urban areas. They have also been documented in tropical agricultural operations. It was also discovered in Florida in 2000, where it makes its webs on canal bridges from east end of Everglades National Park to the east coast of Florida. Studies have suggested that Cyrtophora citricola cannot survive at temperatures below 1 degree Celsius. In Turkey, these spiders usually appear brown with grey hair. They have been most documented in olive orchards and undergrowth. CC BY 2.0 license. Copyright  Home range and Territoriality  Cyrtophora citricola exhibits territorial behavior over their orb-webs. However, tent- webs are seen as communal, and no aggressive behavior has been documented between spiders that travel across these webs. At night there are conflicts between orbless spiders and those that possess orbs. These fights occur due to competition for better feeding locations. Invading spiders may come from the colony's periphery, where costs to build webs may be high due to more frequent repair and diminished prey capture. The conflict ensues typically when an orbless intruder approaches the web and vibrates it. This action is a sign of an attack which solicits the same response from the defending spider. The vibrations between the attacker and the defender continue for up to a few minutes. However, the invader rarely captures the web under contestation and eventually retreats.  Diet = Steps of Capturing Prey  The process of prey capturing includes either biting the prey or wrapping it in silk, pulling and cutting out of the top part of the web, transportation the prey to the hub of the web by either carrying it in their jaws or carrying it on silk, and then, finally, feeding on the prey in the hub of the web.  Attack Sequences  There are four basic attack sequences that have been observed in Cyrtophora citricola: (1) wrap/bite/pull out or cut out/free-wrap, (2) wrap/cut out/free-wrap, (3) bite/wrap/cut out/free-wrap, and (4) bite/pull out (or cut out). Some sequences involve biting the prey, while others involve wrapping the prey. Whether the prey is bitten or wrapped is determined by the type of prey that is captured.  Common Prey  Some common prey of Cyrtophora citricola includes moths, which are usually immobilized by biting and carried to the hub on silk, flies, which are also immobilized by biting and carried to the hub on silk, and Orthopteras, for which Cyrtophora citricola use a wide variety of sequences in their captures. Other common prey includes dragonflies, beetles and pentatomids.  Webs = Web Type  Cyrtophora citricola build horizontal orb webs. Above the orb, they create a thick silk strand barrier and below the orb, they create less thick barrier. The web itself is not sticky, as the silk used to create it is not sticky. The webs are considered to appear as a fine mesh curtaining. They are made of radii and a nonadhesive structural spiral. This is unique from the typical Araneidae family webs, as they do not contain a viscid spiral. Studies have shown that these webs are especially durable, and perhaps have adapted to be created in more open spaces in trees and strong enough to withstand environmental pressures that may ensure (i.e. rain and wind). Unlike adhesive webs, which must be respun daily, these non-adhesive webs are only repaired when damaged. Most of this damage occurs at the peripheries of colony webs where the costs to create orb-webs are high. The center of these colonies may be seldomly repaired, saving the spider constant investment respinning the web. The webs may be large enough to span entire trees and have been found on a large variety of tree species. Studies suggest that Cyrtophora citricola prefer to build their webs on firm substrates when compared to non-firm substrates. Spiders who build webs on firmer substrates tend to make webs which last for long periods of time. When resting and not watching over egg sacs, the spiders typically will rest with all of their legs underneath their body and sit on the hub of the web, on the horizontal portion. This positioning occurs both at night and at some times during the day.  Prey Capturing  Cyrtophora citricola capture their prey in the upper, thicker barrier part of the web. The rate of prey per capita due to web deflection is relatively low, which may cause spiders to aggregate together. Spiders who live in social aggregates have been found to have webs that are more efficient at capturing prey than those who do not live in groups.  Web Jerking  Jerking, which consists of quickly pulling the radii with legs I, has been observed in this species. The documentation situations where this species will jerk their web include in response to web movement and before and after prey capturing. It is hypothesized that web jerking may allow the spider to accurately find objects in its web, thus assisting in actions such as prey location and acting as signal transmission.  Web Shaking  These spiders will also engage in motions that cause sudden, rapid shaking of their webs. This shaking is created by a downward motion of the spiders' legs. Cyrtophora citricola may engage in web shaking to dislodge prey stuck in the upper barrier of the net so that the spider can access it or to try and shake of any approaching kleptoparasites.  Mating  Upon reaching adulthood, the male spiders will look for females, and then die shortly after mating has occurred. These spiders exhibit sexual cannibalism at high rates. The female spiders often will eat the male spiders directly after mating with them. This sexual cannibalism encourages males to be very choosy in who they pick as their female mate. Studies suggest that females are not choosy in their male mates, but that males preferred to mate with younger, more well- fed females. Additionally, males give preference to mating with virgin females over females that have already copulated. When they mate, the female initiates the process. Females traditionally approach the male until they are about 1cm from the male. At this point, the male advances quickly towards the female and tries to insert his pedipalp. If successful, copulation begins and lasts for a few seconds. The male Cyrtophora citricola does not somersault into the female‚Äôs chelicerae. The female bends her cephalothorax and orients herself to attack the male‚Äôs abdomen while the pedipalp is in the female. The male is then eaten and the pedipalp detaches from the female.  Parental Care = Egg Laying  The egg sacs of Cyrtophora citricola are 12-20mm at a maximum diameter and are laid in chains of up to 10 sacs in a row on the webs. The eggs are colored bluish- green. Each egg sac contains between 100 and 200 eggs. The eggs are shaped as flat ellipticals. The number of eggs produced depends on various environmental factors, including food availability. Solitary females were documented to produce approximately 20% more eggs than females living in colonies. The reduction of eggs in colonies has been hypothesized due to better cocoon protection from parasites and reduced predation.  Egg Guarding  Females with egg sacs typically will rest directly underneath the egg sac in order to guard them.  Social Behavior  Cyrtophora citricola may exhibit aggregate social interactions with one another and live cooperatively in groups. The spiders make their own individual webs, but these individuals webs are interconnected in a larger network of webs with neighboring spiders, creating a massive web matrix. They generally coexist peacefully, but if another nearby spider tries to take their prey, they may exhibit aggressive behaviors. This colony living was initially thought to have evolved because of the foraging benefits of group living for the spiders. However, studies suggest that when the spiders are under food- stress, they do not prefer to live in groups, suggesting that there must be some other evolutionary reason that group living evolved in this species. Some Cyrtophora citricola live solitarily. When compared to those living in colonies, the solitary spiders have larger webs, produce more eggs, and have more kleptoparasites.  Enemies  Argyrodes argyrodes, another species of spider, has been found to steal both the Cyrtophora citricola's prey and eggs. In addition, Holocnemus pluchei have been found to build their webs off of Cyrtophora citricola's webs. In addition, Holocnemus pluchei have exhibited aggressive behavior towards Cyrtophora citricola. They have been observed attacking and eating Cyrtophora citricola juveniles. The spider will drop to the ground if attacked, in an attempt to camouflage. Argyrodes gibbosus often acts as a kleptoparasite on Cyrtophora citricola, stealing prey that the Cyrtophora citricola caught. They are known to switch strategies depending on where the host is located. The prey is stolen when the host is in the web. They have been observed waiting for the Cyrtophora citricola to go foraging before consuming their eggs. Pediobius pyrgo are a type of wasp that lays their eggs in Cyrtophora citricola egg sacs. They are present in the Iberian Peninsula and in the Canary Islands. Philolema palanichamyi are a type of wasp that lays their eggs in Cyrtophora citricola egg sacs. They affect these spiders primarily in the Canary Islands and can affect around 40% of egg sacs. Wasp larvae feed on the spider‚Äôs eggs and each larva will devour significant portions of the egg sacs. The incubation takes approximately seven weeks. These often cause a large portion of parasitized spider egg-sacs to die. Parasitization approximately decreases emerging spiderlings by 60%. If Cyrtophora citricola is disturbed by a predator, it may pull all of its legs inwards towards its abdomen.  Protective Coloration and Behavior  They can change their abdomen's color to blend in with the environment. The coloring of the female Floridian spiders allows them to appear as brown, dead leaves when sitting in their webs, preventing potential predators from spotting them.  Physiology = Thermoregulation  Cyrtophora citricola has been shown to exhibit thermoregulative behaviors, a trait that is common in web- building spiders, including Nephila clavipes, N. maculata, and Frontinella communis . During the hottest portions of the day, it was found that the spiders will position themselves so that as little surface area of their body is shown to the sun as possible.  Spinning Apparatus  Other Araneidae species have a triad complex on their posterior spinnerets which produce a gluey thread material for the webs from the piriform glands. Cyrtophora citricola do not have this and are thus unable to make gluey thread web material. The consequence of this is that Cyrtophora citricola create a unique non-sticky, mesh-like web.  Interactions = Agricultural Impact  Plants that have high concentrations of Cyrtophora citricola have reported partial death where webs span over leaves. This may be due to the thickness of the webs that can inhibit airflow to the leaves. As a result, some authorities have opted to use high-pressure water sprayers and chemical controls to exterminate colonies. Cyrtophora citricola have been problematic for many agricultural operations in South American including coffee and citrus plantations. Additionally, they have been increasingly common in the Southern states of North America, particularly Florida, where they have become a common backyard nuisance. References ;Sources * (2004).

He is remembered for The Island of Formosa, Past and Present (1903) on the history of Taiwan and also noted for greatly aiding the internationalisation of Rotary International. Adventure and journalism In 1893 Davidson was a member of the Peary expedition to Greenland, which was attempting to find a route to the North Pole. In 1895 he travelled to Taiwan as a war correspondent to report on the transition from Qing rule to Japanese rule, and witnessed the resistance to the Japanese takeover which centred on the short-lived Republic of Formosa. He was decorated by the Emperor of Japan in 1895 with Order of Rising Sun for services rendered to the Japanese army in capturing the capital of Formosa. Once the Japanese established control over the island, he took up a job as a trader based in the town of Tamsui. In June 1897, he was appointed by President Cleveland consular agent for the island of Formosa, where he remained nine years, during which time he wrote numerous monographs on Formosan affairs. Disappointed by the lack of a comprehensive general history of the island in English, Davidson undertook eight years of research on the subject, poring through accounts in many languages until he was able to write his magnum opus in 1903, which he called The Island of Formosa, Past and Present. The book has gone through several reprints, and remains a central work in the study of the history of Taiwan, with one commentator describing it as \\"the major English language survey of Taiwan for its days and still the most frequently consulted English language source\\". In 1903, he obtained leave of absence, and under the auspices of the Russian Communications Department made a careful survey of the territory adjacent to the Asian section of the Trans-Siberian Railway, collecting material for a complete report of this territory, extracts from which appeared in the Century Magazine (April‚ÄìJune 1903). Diplomatic career, emigration to Canada, Rotary International In 1904, Davidson was appointed to Dalny, Manchuria, one of the political consulates, where he was expected to promote Secretary Hay's \\"open door\\" policy. Later be became consul at Andong, Manchuria, and commercial attach√© to the American legation, Peking, and special agent of the Department of State. He was appointed by President Roosevelt in 1905 consul general at Shanghai. He also served in Nanjing. Invalided out of the service in 1905, he returned to the United States to convalesce, subsequently emigrating to Canada once he had recovered. Once there he became involved in the lumber business, making his fortune and becoming a pillar of the local community. Davidson was an enthusiastic member of the Rotary club in Calgary, and when the organisation wanted to extend its reach throughout the Mediterranean, Middle East, Southeast Asia and Australasia, he was the logical choice as envoy to the region because of his prior international experience. Leaving in 1914, he spent CAN$250,000 of his own money to establish branches of Rotary International in Australia, New Zealand, Turkey, Greece, Egypt, Jerusalem, Burma, Siam (Thailand), Java, and in several of the Malay states including Seremban, Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Penang, Ipoh, Klang and Singapore. In total his trip lasted two and one-half years, and he was responsible for founding over twenty branches of the organisation around the world. He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and member of the Asiatic Society, the Explorers Club and the Authors' Club. In 1915, he was president of eight banks in North Dakota. Davidson died in Vancouver in his adopted homeland of Canada on 18 June 1933.

T. Tutte. It has chromatic number 3, chromatic index 3, girth 4 and diameter 8. The Tutte graph is a cubic polyhedral graph, but is non-hamiltonian. Therefore, it is a counterexample to Tait's conjecture that every 3-regular polyhedron has a Hamiltonian cycle.. Reprinted in Scientific Papers, Vol. II, pp. 85‚Äì98. Published by Tutte in 1946, it is the first counterexample constructed for this conjecture.. Other counterexamples were found later, in many cases based on Grinberg's theorem. Construction The Tutte fragment. From a small planar graph called the Tutte fragment, W. T. Tutte constructed a non- Hamiltonian polyhedron, by putting together three such fragments. The \\"compulsory\\" edges of the fragments, that must be part of any Hamiltonian path through the fragment, are connected at the central vertex; because any cycle can use only two of these three edges, there can be no Hamiltonian cycle. The resulting graph is 3-connected and planar, so by Steinitz' theorem it is the graph of a polyhedron. It has 25 faces. It can be realized geometrically from a tetrahedron (the faces of which correspond to the four large nine-sided faces in the drawing, three of which are between pairs of fragments and the fourth of which forms the exterior) by multiply truncating three of its vertices. Algebraic properties The automorphism group of the Tutte graph is Z/3Z, the cyclic group of order 3. The characteristic polynomial of the Tutte graph is : : (x-3)(x^{15}-22x^{13}+x^{12}+184x^{11}-26x^{10}-731x^9+199x^8+1383x^7-576x^6-1061x^5+561x^4+233x^3-151x^2+4x+4)^2 : (x^{15}+3x^{14}-16x^{13}-50x^{12}+94x^{11}+310x^{10}-257x^9-893x^8+366x^7+1218x^6-347x^5-717x^4+236x^3+128x^2-56x+4). Related graphs Although the Tutte graph is the first 3-regular non- Hamiltonian polyhedral graph to be discovered, it is not the smallest such graph.

History Jukkasj√§rvi Icehotel interior. Sculptures by J√∂rgen Westin In 1989, Japanese ice artists visited the area and created an exhibition of ice art. In Spring 1990, French artist Jannot Derid held an exhibition in a cylinder-shaped igloo in the same area. One night there were no rooms available in the town, so some of the visitors asked for permission to spend the night in the igloo at the exhibition hall. They slept in the igloo in sleeping bags on top of reindeer skins, and were the first guests of the \\"hotel\\". Hotel The entire hotel is made out of snow and ice blocks from the Torne River, even the glasses in the bar are made of ice. Each spring, around March, Icehotel harvests tons of ice from the frozen Torne River and stores it in a nearby production hall with room for over of ice and of snow. The ice is used for creating Icebar designs and ice glasses, which are used for ice sculpting classes, events and product launches all over the world while the snow is used for building a strong structure for the building. About of what is left is used in the construction of the next Icehotel. When completed, the hotel features a bar, church, main hall, reception area, plus about 100 rooms for guests. The room rate starts at 1500 kr. The hotel also hosts an ice restaurant. The furniture is sculpted blocks of ice in the form of chairs and beds. The thick walls, floor and ceiling are made of ice. Even the beds, the fittings and decoration are carved from ice. No two rooms are the same; the rooms are unique works of art. At the Icehotel the beds are bedded with reindeer furs and people are given special equipment to use while sleeping in the hotel. The guests sleep in polar-tested sleeping bags. There is no heating and the bedroom temperatures are constantly around . There is no plumbing at the hotel, but there is a sauna that is run on the premises of the Icehotel with hot tub outdoors. The ice suites do not have any bathroom facilities but bathrooms for guests are found in a warm building close by. There is also warm accommodation available next to the hotel.

The hotel appeared in a sketch about Sweden in one of the shows of the Eurovision Song Contest 2013, courtesy of Lynda Woodruff. The Icehotel has guests from many countries, and it is reported that over one million guests have visited since its creation, although a large proportion of guests visit without staying overnight. Church The local parish of Jukkasj√§rvi, part of the Swedish Church, runs the Ice Church. Following co-operation with the Icehotel, the Swedish Church operates the Ice Church as a regular church. Each year the church is consecrated at the Christmas Day service. During the winter period around 140 couples get married and about twenty children are baptized. Most of the baptized children live in the parish or have parents living there. The wedding co-ordinator can arrange for civil ceremonies to be carried out. Characteristics of a wedding in the Ice Chapel are the cold, the stillness, and a cappella singing. Reverend Jan-Erik Kuoksu from the Jukkasj√§rvi parish started the Ice Church. During his 17 years of service he has united 1,500 couples and baptized many children. Kuoksu worked alone as the priest in the Ice Church for the first fourteen years. His wife, Lisbeth, volunteers as a church usher.

Icebars Icehotel AB searched for business partners during the early and mid-1990s, and the founder, Yngve Bergqvist, decided upon Absolut Vodka as the first sponsor. The first Absolut Icebar opened in Icehotel in 1994, and today the concept is used in three cities: London, Stockholm and Jukkasj√§rvi. Several high-profile events around the Icehotel have since been initiated by Absolut Vodka. In 1994, the extension was an advertising shoot for Absolut Vodka to Jukkasj√§rvi, with photographer Herb Ritts. Models Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Mark Findlay and Marcus Schenkenberg were photographed surrounded by ice, wearing creations designed by fashion designer Gianni Versace. Guests are served vodka in glasses made of ice from the Torne River, often described as a drink \\"in the rocks\\". Ice glasses at the bars are brought from the production hall in Jukkasj√§rvi to the Icehotel. This is also the case with the interior creations, because every six months they are replaced on site by staff from the ice production and artists. This is done to ensure quality and safety. Icebar by Icehotel is a franchise concept for ice bar. The concept was launched in spring 2009, with the opening of the Ice Bar CPH by Icehotel in Copenhagen, Denmark. The bar was followed in June of that year by the Ice Bar Tokyo by Icehotel in Tokyo, Japan, and shortly after, the Icebar Oslo by Icehotel in Oslo, Norway.

In 2013 over 200 requests were submitted by different artists with different qualifications ‚Äì including theatre, structural design, camerawork and interior design. The artists will start the work in Jukkasjarvi starting each year in November to build the suites. When the temperature drops and the snow guns start humming on the Torne River shore, usually in mid-November, the building process begins. The snow is sprayed on huge inverted catenary shaped steel forms and allowed to freeze. After a couple of days, the forms are removed, leaving a maze of free-standing corridors of snow. In the corridors, dividing walls are built in order to create rooms and suites. Ice blocks are then transported into the hotel, where selected artists start creating the art and design of the perishable material. The Icehotel in Jukkasj√§rvi opens in phases.

Also known as \\"the people's poetry\\" and \\"Bedouin poetry\\", Nabati has a long heritage, with examples of the Nabati form referenced by the medieval historian Ibn Khaldun in his Muqaddimah (Introduction), first published in 1377. It is thought that the word Nabati derives from Nabatean, the civilisation that rose in North-Western Arabia and had its core in the city of Petra. Nabati poetry has a pedigree that reaches back centuries. Bedouin poets composed verse similar in structure, theme, metre and rhyme to the works of Imru'l Qays and other pre-Islamic poets. These qasidas set the classical standard for hundreds of years. Remarkably, until quite recently, verse composed by illiterate Bedouin masters of the art has remained close in spirit and language to these examples. Prominent historical Nabati poets include Ibn Daher who lived in Ras Al Khaimah in the 16th century and whose work still influences the poetry today. Ibn Li'bun (1790‚Äì1831), known in the Persian Gulf region as \\"Prince of the Nabati Poets\\" was also prominent figure in the form, who corresponded with other poets across the region and whose work has led to many traditional popular tunes in Arabia. Nabati was long an aural tradition and researchers have encountered Bedouin who can memorise 20,000 poems. An important cultural element in the daily life of the region, Nabati poetry was used to declare war, seek peace and resolve tribal disputes. It is considered unique to Arabia. The form was a key element not only of regional culture but communications prior to the 20th Century but lapsed with the development of the region following the discovery of oil. It has enjoyed a considerable renaissance and is now a celebrated medium of both poetry and song, particularly in the UAE where practitioners such as Ousha bint Khalifa Al Suwaidi (known as Fatat Al Arabi) have become celebrated figures.  In the United Arab Emirates  Among the first Classical Arabic UAE poets to gain importance in this part of the world during the twentieth century were Mubarak Al Oqaili (1880‚Äì1954), Salem bin Ali Al Owais (1887‚Äì1959) and Ahmed bin Sulayem (1905?‚Äì1976). Salem bin Ali Al Owais was born in Al- Heera, a village between Sharjah and Ajman. Three other poets of importance in the UAE were Khalfan Musabah (1923‚Äì1946), Sheikh Saqr Al Qasimi (1925‚Äì1993), an ex-ruler of Sharjah, and Sultan bin Ali Al Owais (1925‚Äì2000). The three poets, known as the Heera group, grew up in the village of Al-Heera in Sharjah and were close friends. One of the largest Nabati poetry competitions known as Million's Poet has been held biannually in the UAE since 2006 and is broadcast as a reality TV show. The UAE's first Nabati academy was founded in 2008.

The name identifies both a musical form and the type of materials used. History The rond√≤ became the most fashionable showpiece aria type in Italian opera during the last three decades of the 18th century . Although Mozart was far from being the first composer to use the rond√≤, he was certainly the most important. He refined and deepened the form, particularly by creating smoother transitions between the slow and fast sections. He first adopted it for Belmonte‚Äôs \\"Wenn der Freude Tr√§nen fliessen\\" in his 1782 Singspiel Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail. Subsequently he began using them in opera seria, first in the 1786 revival of Idomeneo, when he inserted a new aria, \\"Non temer, amato bene\\", in rond√≤ form. In the same year he provided another one for Der Schauspieldirektor, and initially sketched (but ultimately rejected using) a rond√≤ for Susanna's garden aria in Le nozze di Figaro. Two later Mozart operas with rond√≤s are Don Giovanni and Cos√¨ fan tutte (Fiordiligi‚Äôs ‚ÄúPer piet√†, ben mio, perdona‚Äù) . For his last opera, La clemenza di Tito, Mozart wrote a pair of rond√≤s: Vitellia‚Äôs \\"Non pi√π di fiori\\" and Sesto‚Äôs \\"Deh per questo istante\\" . Other notable composers of the period to compose rond√≤s include Giuseppe Sarti (Giulio Sabino, 1781) and Domenico Cimarosa, whose Olimpiade (1784) includes two long rond√≤s for the prima donna, Aristea, and the primo uomo, Megacle. The longer of the two goes to the hero in the penultimate scene of the opera . Joseph Haydn employed the form in 1784 for the aria \\"Dei pietosi\\" in Armida . Form The rond√≤ is distinct from the refrain form called rondo . In recent English and German musical literature, the Italian spelling and pronunciation (with accent on the last syllable) has been adopted to distinguish this from the (predominantly instrumental) form called rondo (with accent on the first syllable). No such distinction was made in the late 18th century when this vocal type flourished; the spellings rondo, rond√≤, rondeau, rondeaux, and even rondieaoux were used indiscriminately for both musical forms . The leading feature of the rond√≤ as a form is its division into two sections with contrasting tempos. The opening part is slow, and presents a theme that often returns after a contrasting section to form an ABA pattern. This is followed by a concluding faster part, beginning either with a new theme or with a faster variation of the slow section‚Äôs main theme. Sometimes the text associated with the main theme of the slow section recurs in the second half as well. In the opera, these arias are generally assigned only to the prima donna or primo uomo and are strategically placed in or near the concluding scene or else (in a three-act opera) as the final number of the second act . The form is similar to, and may have developed from the compound binary form (ABA'B'), with an added faster coda, called a stretta (ABA'B':CC'), a variant form of the rond√≤ found in Mozart's \\"Non mi dir\\" from Don Giovanni (1787). Another possible antecedent is a truncated variant of an ABABA refrain-form rondo, in which the final refrain is omitted and the A and B sections are given contrasting slow-fast tempos‚Äîa form favoured by the Neapolitan poet Saverio Mattei and which is found in \\"Non ho colpa\\" from Mozart's Idomeneo . The repetitions of themes within each section was an invitation for the singer to add virtuoso embellishments upon its return . Content The metre of a rond√≤ is almost always duple, and usually both sections are cast in the rhythms of a gavotte. The keys of A major and F major (the tonalities of Mozart‚Äôs rond√≤s for Sesto and Vitellia in La clemenza di Tito), appear to have been favoured for this form . Text Rond√≤ texts usually employ an elevated rhetorical style and are almost always either laments of unhappy lovers or conventional calls to love. As a result, they are rather generalised and conventional in expression, detached and distant emotionally, so that they are easily transferable from one opera libretto to another, as happened with \\"Non tardar amato bene\\", rejected by Mozart for Le nozze di Figaro and recycled by his librettist, Lorenzo Da Ponte for another opera, Il demogorgone, ovvero il filosofo confuso, set by Vincenzo Righini . While there are examples of two-strophe rond√≤s through most of its period of popularity, the poetry far more often consists of three quatrains of ottonario, with the third quatrain usually shifting mood or dramatic focus in order to justify a new musical section. The slow part of the music sets the first two quatrains in an ABA pattern. The fast music uses the final quatrain for its main theme, and repeats parts of the earlier text (most often from the second quatrain) for the contrasting material. In later examples, where the fast sections become longer and more complex, material from all three stanzas came to be used (; ).

It was built for the 369th Regiment, also known as the \\"Harlem Hell Fighters\\", founded in 1913 as the first National Guard unit in New York State composed solely of African-Americans. It later became home to the 369th Sustainment Brigade. The 369th Regiment Armory includes two structures. The administration building, built in the Art Deco style between 1930 and 1933, was designed by John S. Van Wart and Sidney Wein. The attached medieval-inspired drill shed, built between 1921 and 1924, was designed by Tachau and Vought and measures . Both sections are constructed of brick. The armory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, and was designated as a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1985.  History = Context  After the American Civil War ended, the New York state government passed a law, which mandated that armories be erected for volunteer regiments by each of the individual counties. This resulted in the Armory Board of the City of New York being created in April 1884.The board erected many of Manhattan's armories: prior to the board's establishment, only one armory had been built in Manhattan, the Seventh Regiment Armory on the Upper East Side. As such, most volunteer regiments drilled in any available space, such as public markets or rented building lofts. By the late 19th and early 20th century, the former Dutch colonial settlement of Harlem was being developed into a primarily African- American neighborhood, having become accessible via the newly built New York City Subway. In the 1910s, a hundred members of a community center in Harlem stated their intention to join the military. The 15th Regiment, whose parent unit was constituted in the New York Army National Guard in 1913, was officially organized three years later, in preparation for being deployed to France during World War I. The 15th was the first National Guard regiment constituted based on race, as it was composed entirely of African Americans. The regiment reached its full strength of 2,000 men by 1917, and trained in New York and South Carolina because they did not yet have their own armory. The 15th Regiment was reorganized as the 369th in 1918. The 369th Regiment had returned from France by February 1919; a parade for the regiment was held on Fifth Avenue.  Construction  Astor Row, original location of the 369th Regiment The 369th Regiment (also known by their nickname, the \\"Harlem Hell Fighters\\") was initially housed at Astor Row on West 130th Street. However, as a result of the unit's reorganization, the Armory Board was now obligated to create an armory for the 369th Regiment. The city's acting mayor promised an armory structure to the 369th Regiment in 1919. Funding for the 369th Regiment Armory was approved by the city in July 1921. The initial plans called for building only the drill shed; an administration building was required for the armory to be fully functional. The city located a site on Fifth Avenue between 142nd and 143rd Streets and demolished the tenements there. Work on the armory's drill shed was begun with a groundbreaking ceremony in November 1921. This was followed by a request for proposals to design the drill shed, for which five firms submitted bids. Tachau and Vought, who had previously designed the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx, won the commission and designed the structure in the Romanesque style. Post & McCord were selected as the contractors. The cost of the drill shed was estimated at $700,000, and the administration building, another $500,000. The cornerstone was laid in November 1923, when construction was already progressing. and the drill shed was finished the following November at a cost of $800,000. The rest of the block was purchased by the city in 1929, in preparation for the administration building's construction. In 1930, the Armory Board submitted plans for the $1 million administration building to the New York City Board of Estimate. The new building would include a shooting range, auditorium, mess hall, and rooftop tennis courts. Twelve firms submitted designs for the drill shed, and the commission was ultimately given to the lowest bidder, John S. Van Wart and Sidney Wein. Work started in 1931 after the C & W Construction Company were named as the contractors. The administration building was completed in 1933. However, the New York Daily News reported in January 1934 that the 369th Regiment had refused to accept title to the administration building, citing various work defects such as a leaky roof. As a result, the Armory Board opened an investigation into the construction of the 369th Administration Building.  Uses  In 1934, during the Great Depression, the 369th Regiment Armory and Brooklyn's 14th Regiment Armory were used as temporary homeless shelters. Two years later, the armory exhibited artwork from 40,000 people that had been hired through the Works Progress Administration. The 369th Regiment Armory also hosted sporting events, such as track and field competitionsSee, for instance: * * and tennis matches.See, for instance: * * Other events hosted at the armory included a speech by Black Muslim leader Elijah Muhammad in 1964, and a soccer demonstration from Brazilian soccer player Pel√© in 1978. The 369th Armory was again used as a temporary shelter during early 1981 due to extreme cold weather. By the 1980s, existing homeless shelters in New York City had become overcrowded, so the city started opening new shelters in armories. In 1982, the state turned over the 369th Regiment Armory to the city so that the latter could open a 200-bed men's homeless shelter. However, the 369th Sustainment Brigade still operated out of the armory. In the 1990s, the 369th Regiment Armory received part of a $390,000 funding allocation that had been made available as part of the city's Tax Syndication Sharing Program. The funds were intended for the armory's restoration. The structure was protected as a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1985, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. As part of the New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the 369th Regiment Armory was planned to be used for boxing and rhythmic gymnastics if the city were to win the Olympic bid. The armory, which still remained decrepit, would have been restored. These plans were canceled when the bid was rejected in 2005. The Police Athletic League of New York City used part of the 369th Regiment Armory's drill shed as a community center starting in 2006. The Harlem Children's Zone also operated programs in the armory, taking about half of the space. In September 2012, a community program painted a mural on the armory's walls that was devoted to the 369th Regiment's history. Soon afterward, in October 2012, the armory partially flooded during Hurricane Sandy. The 369th Regiment Armory temporarily closed for renovations in 2014. At the time, it was expected to be renovated into a museum showing 369th Regiment memorabilia. The 369th Brigade moved back to the space in November 2018. However, the armory remained closed to civilians due to a lead cleanup project, which prevented civilians from reentering the facility until the cleanup was complete. Despite fears that children at the armory may have been susceptible to lead poisoning for over a decade, state officials said that the cleanup was limited to the basement, which was off-limits to kids.  Description  The 369th Regiment Armory is located between West 142nd and 143rd Streets at 2360 Fifth Avenue, along its western sidewalk. It is the northernmost building on Fifth Avenue. The armory is composed of two structures in contrasting architectural styles: the medieval-style drill shed and the Art Deco-style administration building. The armory occupies nearly its entire lot, which measures from north to south and from west to east. It is associated with the 369th Regiment, the first African-American regiment in the New York Army National Guard. The surrounding areas are composed of industrial buildings, while the Harlem River Drive runs on the opposite side of Fifth Avenue across from the armory. The AIA Guide to New York City described the armory as \\"a superb example of the bricklayer's art\\" and that the brickwork \\"exhibit[s] an Art Deco/Moderne style rather than an attempt to reconstruct a medieval fortress\\".  Administration building  Administration building The -story, rectangular administration building features a terracotta parapet embellished with chevron designs and stylized eagles. See also: The basement is raised by half a story and contains a water table made of red sandstone. Throughout the building, the first-story windows contain iron grilles with decorations depicting maces and stars. The main facade, to the east, contains numerous recessed and projecting sections, alternating with each other. This facade contains its main entrance pavilion in the center, and two asymmetric side pavilions to the north and south. Above the entrance pavilion is a sandstone surround, which contains the carved letters \\"369th Infantry N.Y.C.\\" and is flanked by eagle-wing motifs that contain lanterns. The raised basement also contains entrances surrounded with sandstone trim. Adjacent to the eastern facade is a circular driveway with an adjacent small parking lot. A small lawn is located between the driveway and Fifth Avenue. A statue to the 369th Regiment stands across Fifth Avenue from the administration building. The northern and southern facades are located next to the sidewalks of 143rd and 142nd Streets, respectively. Inside, the corridors contain terrazzo tile floors as well as cornices with chevron motifs. A company meeting room is located at the administration building's southeast corner and includes parquet floors, a fireplace with a carved mantel, walls with walnut-wood paneling, and plaster walls and ceilings. As originally proposed, the administration building was supposed to be five stories high and measuring , surrounding a courtyard with dimensions of . The ground floor was to contain various living quarters, an officers' mess, a 600-person entertainment room, and a reception room. Above that, each of the regiments' companies would have their own floor, and a top-floor suite for the regiment's colonel.  Drill shed  The drill shed is stories, with a clerestory level on the top story, and measures from west to east. Like the administration building, it contains a terracotta parapet, with a gable roof behind it. The northern and southern facades are articulated with vertical brick buttresses, which divide each facade into 15 vertical bays. On each facade, there is a central pavilion that measures three bays wide, as well as side pavilions that each measure six bays wide. The side entrances are framed with medieval-styled sandstone. The interior features three tiers of balconies on all four sides with a seating capacity of 6,000‚Äì7,000. When it opened, the New York Age described it as having dimensions of , with a gallery capacity of 5,000.

It is led by three-year-term president of the board who is appointed by the President upon the recommendation of Foreign Minister. Mission The Korea International Cooperation Agency was founded as a government agency on April 1, 1991, to maximize the effectiveness of South Korea's grant aid programs for developing countries by implementing the government's grant aid and technical cooperation programs. In the past, development cooperation efforts were focused mainly on meeting the basic human needs (BHNs) of developing countries and on fostering their Human Resource Development(HRD). However, the focus has now broadened to promoting sustainable development, strengthening partnerships with developing partners, and enhancing the local ownership of beneficiaries. Additionally, global concerns such as the environment, poverty reduction, and gender mainstreaming, have gained significant importance in the international community. Due to the continuously changing trends in development assistance efforts and practices, KOICA is striving to adapt to these changes by using its limited financial resources effectively in areas where Korea has a comparative advantage. In particular, Korea has the experience of developing from one of the poorest countries in the world to one of the most economically advanced, as recently demonstrated by South Korea's entry into the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) on November 25, 2009. The know-how and experience Korea gained from this transition are the assets that allow KOICA to efficiently support the sustainable socio-economic development of its partner countries.

The war destroyed two-thirds of South Korea's national production capacity and sent unemployment rates soaring. In 1961, nearly a decade after the war‚Äôs end, South Korea's per-capita GNP remained a meager $82. Its level of domestic savings was almost negligible. During these hard and often desperate times, the Korean people could barely survive without foreign aid. Aid was provided mainly for the supply of commodities such as food, clothing, medicine, and raw materials. Foreign assistance was also used as the main source for financing the country's deficit throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. More accurately, foreign aid was virtually the only source of capital earned up until the end of the 1950s. During the reconstruction period of 1953-1960, more than 70 percent of South Korea's imports were financed by foreign aid. Following the inception of the first Five-Year Economic Development Plan in 1962, foreign assistance began to play a more substantive role in the economic and social development of Korea. The new political leadership was strongly committed to national development and social stability and eager to induce foreign capital and assistance to fill the gap between payments the deficit, and offset the insufficiencies of domestic savings and investment. The government launched numerous infrastructure development projects but they required huge amounts of investment. Nevertheless, the amount of grant aid was declining and the domestic savings rate was still meager. In response, the government took a substantial amount of commercial and concessional loans constructive, and new technology from abroad. Foreign assistance in the 1960s functioned as a major source of capital and investment and as a means to improve management skills and industrial technology. Major donors during those years included the International Development Associations (IDA), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and bilateral agencies such as the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan. As a donor (1990s-present) After successfully overcoming the 1997-98 financial crisis and the following economic recession, South Korea is today recognized as a post-war success story. Through properly designed development strategies and effective use of foreign assistance, South Korea has grown into the world's 11th largest economy and is a leading producer of ships, steel, automobiles, and semiconductors. In 1996, South Korea joined the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Throughout the period of rapid economic development, there has been a considerable amount of interest in South Korea's economic performance and policies. As a result, there has been an increasing demand from the international community for South Korea's economic and technical cooperation. The history of South Korea's donorship dates back to the mid-1960s when the South Korean government provided invitational training to technical staff from developing countries under the sponsorship of USAID. Since then, several other programs for development cooperation have been initiated, including expertise sharing in 1967, aid in kind in 1977, and feasibility studies in 1984. Nevertheless, South Korea's independent contribution to international development is a recent phenomenon. As early as the 1980s, the South Korean government designed a program for the purpose of sharing its experiences of rapid and dynamic development based on the spirit of South-South cooperation. Many believed that South Korea's first-hand experiences could be of great help in assisting other developing countries. In 1982, the so-called International Development Exchange Program(IDEP) began to invite government officials and policymakers to participate in training courses composed of lectures, seminars, workshops, and field trips. The government's technical cooperation programs, including the IDEP, grew in popularity among developing countries, and boosted by such a growing demand, the South Korean government sought to create a more consistent and systematic channel for development cooperation. In 1987, the South Korean government established the Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) through which concessional loans for development projects were provided to the governments of developing countries. In 1991, the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) was established to manage grant aid and technical cooperation programs. According to the OECD, 2019 official development assistance from South Korea increased 13.9% to USD 2.5 billion.https://www.oecd- ilibrary.org//sites/d919ff1a-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/5e331623-en&_csp_=b14d4f60505d057b456dd1730d8fcea3&itemIGO;=oecd&itemContentType;=chapter#section-d1e24426 Schemes Korea International Cooperation Agency has adopted \\"win-win platform for expanding the role of ODA strategic advantage\\", \\"enlarging Korean model of ODA projects reflecting South Korea's past development experience and strengths\\", \\"expanding strategic ODA and supports for developing states\\", \\"advancing KOICA's competencies\\", and \\"strengthening ODA education for Â∞ç-publics\\" as strategic goals to become the world's leading aid agency. Korea International Cooperation Agency is working toward building effective and efficient grant-aid structure and spreading South Korea's experience of rapid economic development to best facilitate eradicating poverty in international society. Major policy directions *Encouraging the Civil Society Organizations and the private sector to join KOICA's projects. *Expanding untied aid. *Increasing the volume of ODA and the ration of grant aid. *Implementing a result-based management system that meets the needs of partner countries. *Implementing South Korea's development experience and comparative advantages into develop cooperation projects. *Maintaining the 'Selection and Focus' Principle. *Strengthening capacity for ODA implementation. World Friends Korea World Friends Korea (WFK) is both the new name and the new program for volunteers dispatched overseas by the Korean government. The program is similar to the American Peace Corps program. In 2009, the South Korean government unified the separate volunteer programs previously operated by three different ministries into a single brand, \\"WFK\\", to enhance the effectiveness of the overseas volunteer programs while also offering a coherent and integrated image for Korea\`s overseas volunteer programs. As another two volunteer programs joined the WFK in 2010, it is a single brand name for seven different programs coordinated by KOICA. More than 20,000 WFK volunteers will be dispatched from 2009 to 2013. They will contribute to the socioeconomic development of developing countries, spreading the good image of Korea. Multilateral cooperation Multilateral systems provide the best prospects for an inclusive process to set the \\"rules for international conduct\\" and a forum to promote values important to Korea, including democracy, human development and social justice. To promote aid effectiveness and harmonize with the international community, KOICA is continuing to strengthen its network with multilateral organization through contributions, joint programs, joint evaluation of projects, and joint training courses. By collaborating with multilateral organizations, so called \\"multi-bi assistance\\", KOICA expects to diversify ODA delivery channels. Grant aid represents over 60% of multilateral assistance. Global Disease Eradication Fund As an innovative measure to draw attention on the global issues such as poverty and diseases, the government of Republic of Korea established the 'Global Disease Eradication Fund' for the purpose of eradicating infectious diseases in low income countries. Since September 2007, every international flight ticket departing from Republic of Korea has donated 1,000 won(KRW) to this fund. Global Disease Eradication Fund cooperates with International Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations and social activists. And those are used to support infectious diseases maternal- child health projects in sub-Saharan Africa.

Task Force 73 commander (CTF-73) Rear Admiral Tom Carney noted: :The fact that CARAT attracts navies from the region is a particularly important point. I look at 2011 as the first of many successful years of engagement between the U.S. and Bangladesh Navies. CARAT Bangladesh combined training events ashore and at sea, with shore events focused on dive training, riverine warfare, ship boarding training, and medical and community service projects. At-sea training operations included helicopter operations, shipboard communications and maneuvering drills, surface gunnery exercises. and tactical freeplay events. CARAT Cambodia The U.S. destroyer Kidd and salvage ship Safeguard subsequently participated in the 2nd annual CARAT Cambodia bilateral exercise which began on 20 October 2011 with opening ceremonies in Sihanoukville. TF-73 commander Admiral Carney (pictured) added: :Last year marked an important step forward in the relationships between the U.S. and Cambodian Navies. This year, for the first time, a ship from the U.S. Navy, one of our newest destroyers, will be getting underway with royal Cambodian navy ships for a series of at-sea events. The week-long CARAT Cambodia exercises included training exchanges and community activities ashore and such at-sea operations as communication drills, division tactics, and surface gunfire drills. CARAT Brunei The guided-missile destroyers and joined the U.S. Navy land-based patrol squadron VP-40 for the 17th annual CARAT Brunei exercises which began on 30 September 2011 in opening ceremonies held at the Muara Naval Base. CTF-73 Admiral Carney observed: :This is a key year for our exercise, as it marks the first time in two years both the U.S. and Royal Brunei Navies are returning to sea together. Improving cooperation and advancing interoperability at sea is the cornerstone of CARAT, and we have a short but ambitious schedule of underway events planned. The eight-day exercise included training exchanges ashore on maritime domain awareness, search-and-rescue, fire fighting and damage control, vessel boarding procedures, and various maritime symposia. U.S. Marines joined Bruneian Land Forces for urban operations and first aid training. At-sea operations included joint helicopter operations, search and rescue practical scenarios, division tactics, and surface gunfire drills.

It is celebrated in the first month of the Dagomba lunar year, the Bugum Goli (the month of fire), and is celebrated on the ninth day of the month. The festival is celebrated to remember the \\"lost of a chief son\\".  Traditional Origin Story  The origin of the Bugum Festival dates back to the time when one king lost his dear son. The name of the king and the said son are no longer known. Some also claimed that the event took place before the arrival of the ruling class in modern Dagbon, Mamprugu and Nanung. The descendants of the ruling class are present day chiefs and kings in Dagbon, Mamprusi and Nanung. The story has it that a child went out to play with his colleagues and as they played, he became tired and went and laid down under a tree. He soon fell asleep. The other children forgot of him and went home when they finished playing. In the evening, the parents (king and wife) did not see him. The king thought he was with the mother and the mother also thought the child was with the father. After supper that the mother called on the king to take the child to bed. It was at that moment that they found that the child was not with any of them. The king ordered his subjects to go round the neighborhood in search for the son. They did not find him. Even, the children he went out with could not remember. The king quickly assembled his warriors and told them what had transpired. The warriors were instructed to look for the son. Because it was at night and dark, the people lit torches in search of him. Finally they found him under a tree deeply asleep. They sent him to his parents who were desperately waiting for his arrival. The parents thought that the tree stole the child and hid him. They therefore considered the tree an evil tree and threw the torches they were carrying on that tree and shamed it. The community at that time regarded that particular tree as an evil tree and many feared it. The king decreed that the event should be marked yearly to commemorate the event. Every year they assembled in front of the king's palace to celebrate the festival. When they set fire, the king or the chief used to be the first to lite the fire with his torch. The chief did not go far and dropped his torch and returned home. The people continued the practice and used to go to the evil tree and threw their torches on it. While marching to the evil tree, they played and danced ziem, a dance for the tindaamba 'land priests'. The people used to and still dress as warriors when celebrating Bugum Chugu in Dagbon.  Islamic Origin Story  An alternate origin story of the festival states that it dates back to the time the Prophet Noah landed his Ark on Mount Arafat. According to this tradition, when the Ark of Noah landed at the end of the floods the passengers lit torches to 1) find their way around and 2) to find the son of prophet Noah who failed to enter the Ark when it set out with the believers. To buttress this claim of the origin of the Bugum Festival, some Muslim Dagombas further claim that they are descendants of the Aad, a prehistoric Arab tribe that succeeded Noah and his people. This version of the festival's origin is problematic for several reasons. First, such a festival is not celebrated by the Muslim world. Second, the Mamprusi who are related to the Dagomba through their common ancestor Naa Gbewa believe in the traditional story. Finally, Dagbamba (Dagomba) do not originate from Aad and had nothing to do with Arabs. Dagbani is a Gur language and all tribes who celebrate the festivals are Gur: Mamprusi, Nanumba, Gonja, Waala and Chakosi/Anufo. One may argue that because they are among the Gur people that they adopted the festival.  Observance  When the people are celebrating Bugum Chugu, they dance ziem even to this very day. Ziem is a dance for the tindaamba. It is older than any other dance in Dagbon. It is played with gungong, which is older than any instrument in Dagbon. The people also play ziem when they are going to war. It is played when there is a communal labor. They again play ziem when a tindana 'land priest' dies. The early kings quickly adopted the playing of ziem during the installation and death of Yaan Naa and chiefs to make them acceptable to the aboriginal Dagbamba. In the olden days not all villages had the gungong, because of that villages which were closer to each other used to meet in one village where they celebrate the Bugum Chugu and danced Ziem. Even now, it is still happening. Bugum Chugu is a typical traditional festival celebrated with traditional and local tools such as torches and the celebrants dress like warriors and they often carry cudgels and cutlasses along. They play and dance ziem as they celebrate the festival. Bugum Chugu is completely different from other Islamic festivals imported into the country. Muslims do not partake in the celebration of Bugum Chugu as they claim that it is satanic. They will not regard a true Islamic festival as satanic. The festival has not got Arabic name unlike the rest of Islamic festivals celebrated by the people and other Muslim communities. The Festival is simply called Bugum Chugu. Islam was introduced into Dagbon by Naa Zanjina. But there is a claim that Bugum Chugu was celebrated by the people before the arrival of the Islamic clerics.  Ceremony preparation  The celebration of the festival starts on the ninth day of Bugum Goli. Normally, except essential services such as fetching of water, grinding of flour, sale of meat and taking care of the sick, no work is allowed to be done on any Dagomba festival day. So on this day everyone (men, women and children) stays at home. The men start the day moving round each other's homes to say good morning and Happy New Year. Everyone is heard saying \\"Ni ti yuun palli\\" (literally and our new year). After a brief exchange of the new year greetings, people sit at home and engage in normal conversation. The young boys look for dry grass to prepare long torches for distribution to their grandparents, grand aunts, grand uncles and maternal uncles. After preparation, the boys take them to the homes of the recipients. As the afternoon approaches most house owners kill fowl, guinea-fowl, goats or sheep to feast on. The feast is done both in the afternoon and in the evening. Homes that cannot afford animals or fowl may buy meat from the butchers. The most common soup for supper on the night of the festival is made from the leaves of a tree called puhuga (Tamaridus Indica). Even though every home cooks food for the day and the night, everybody distributes food to friends and relatives. There is so much food for the day that not even half of it would be eaten. After eating the evening meal, morsels and pieces of meat are cut and placed on the short walls in the house. This food is said to be for the dead ancestors of the person who put it there. The food is also said to be for God. The people make their vows and declarations while placing the food on the walls. They ask God to give them a long life, or a husband, or children or any other thing. They vow to do or abstain from some action. Ceremony ritual The actual ceremony for the festival starts after the evening meal. The drum beater comes to the palace to sound the drum. He, through the drumming, summons the tom-tom beaters and the Elders of the state the in palace. As they arrive one after the other, the commoners also come along. When everybody is gathered outside the palace, the Elders of state led by a wulana, the chief linguist, enter the chief's court to invite him outside. Some of the Elders lead the way and the chief follows. The rest of the elders follow the chief. Before the chief comes out, everybody is ready with his or her torch of grass. The chief is the first to light his torch. The chief is led a little distance from where the crowd is gathered to cast away his lit-up torch. He moves back into the palace as the multitude of people yell and chant in a war-like manner amidst the deafening sound of the tom-tom and drums. There is usually a spot at the outskirts of the town where the multitude of people move to for the celebration of the Bugum Festival. Everybody holds high his or her burning torch. To prevent drops of fire from falling onto their clothes and burning them, many of the celebrators wet their clothes. Except for a few girls who are daredevils, women are hardly seen in the crowd. They usually stay in their homes or at the outside of the palace until the crowd returns. Then they join in the closing chants and dance for the evening. Ceremony tools and mood The people hold not only their torches but also swords, cutlasses, knives, bows, arrows and cudgels. The mood of the people is war-like. The atmosphere is heavily charged and it may appear ominous to any person who has never witnessed the occasion.

He took holy orders, was appointed lecturer at St Martin's Church (Carfax, Oxford) on 21 October 1632, and proceeded Bachelor of Divinity (BD) on 28 July 1636. Of puritan views, he was elected in 1643 to the Westminster Assembly, but refused to sit; he also declined the degree of Doctor of Divinity (DD) when nominated for it on 6 June 1646. Tozer was appointed vicar of Yarnton in 1644, but was an absentee. As bursar and sub-rector of Exeter College, Tozer managed the college in the absence of George Hakewill, the rector. In March 1647 he was cited before the parliamentary visitors for continuing the Book of Common Prayer, and for his known dislike of parliamentarians. In November he was summoned to Westminster before the parliamentary commission, and the following year was imprisoned for some days on refusing to give up the college books. He was expelled from his fellowship on 26 May 1648, and on 4 June turned out of St. Martin's Church by soldiers because he prayed for the king. The decree, however, was revoked on 2 November, and Tozer was allowed to travel for three years, retaining his room in Exeter College. Tozer then went to Holland, and became minister to the English merchants at Rotterdam, where he died on 11 September 1650; he was buried in the English church there.

Phloretin hydrolase hydrolyses phloretin into phloretic acid and phloroglucinol.  Pharmacological research  In an animal model, phloretin inhibited active transport of glucose into cells by SGLT1 and SGLT2, though the inhibition is weaker than by its glycoside phlorizin. An important effect of this is the inhibition of glucose absorption by the small intestine and the inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption. Phloretin also inhibits a variety of urea transporters. It induces urea loss and diuresis when coupled with high protein diets. Phloretin has been found to inhibit weight gain and improve metabolic homeostasis in mice fed with high-fat diet.

They are considered to be the first major local representative of punk rock and inspiring several local punk bands during the late 1990s. In the 16 years, Tolga being the only constant member, Rashit has had numerous lineup changes. To date, Rashit has released three studio albums and a couple of LPs Kadik√∂y'den Hareketler, Taksim'de Bangyjumping . Their 1999 album Tela≈üa Mahal Yok has been regarded by some critics as the milestone for Turkish punk rock genre. They are particularly known for their use of aggressive lyrics which was titled as \\"punk'n roll\\" by themselves during the initial years. Lyrics are often reflect matters of personal/social deviance, anti racism and degenerated politics. History=Formation and early career (1993-1998) Rashit was formed in Istanbul in 1993 by Tolga √ñzbey. √ñzbey was inspired by The Clash, Sex Pistols, Dead Kennedys and Dirty Rotten Imbeciles during his early years. √ñzbey had numerous involvements in many temporary underground groups during this period. With one of his groups named Sert Itham, he managed to arrange a split demo record with Japanese punk group Argue Damnation but after a long hangover night he could not make it to the post office next day and the chance was missed. He stated that he still keeps the record as a remembrance. After a couple of demo tapes, Rashit had a split 7‚Äù with another Turkish band Ask It Why titled as Kadik√∂y'den Hareketler. The band later recorded a split tape with English punk outfit Active Minds. Due to continuous personal conflicts among members, the group broke up in 1998; √ñzbey joined yet another punk group as a bass player. Up to this date, most performances were recorded unprofessionally, almost always copied with a regular cassette player at home and distributed personally by the members. Debut album Tela≈üa Mahal Yok (1999-2003) In 1999 √ñzbey formed the group once again with the new members Oƒüuz Taktak (vocals) and Atilla Kƒ±r√ßelli (guitar). The same year first album Tela≈üa Mahal Yok was released by Kod M√ºzik. The total expense for the album was around 350 USD. 1999-2000 period was mainly occupied by tours and live concerts. Activities were on hold for around a year when √ñzbey went to New York City. When √ñzbey was back the group reformed with new recruits Orkun Tun√ß (drums) and B√ºlent Kaba≈ü (bass), the two became the permanent members of the group. In 2001 Rashit released another 7‚Äù, Taksim'de Bangyjumping through Dutch Kroket Records. Due to financial bottleneck that Kod M√ºzik suffered, Rashit signed a contract with Ada M√ºzik in 2002. Adam Olmak Istemiyorum and Her≈üeyin Bir Bedeli Var (2003-present)  With the solid members group went on to release 2 more albums, Adam Olmak ƒ∞stemiyorum, was released through Ada M√ºzik and Her≈üeyin Bir Bedeli Var, was released through Sony Music. These albums helped Rashit to gain recognition both locally and internationally. The group participated among many live concerts and youth festivals. The appearances in Rock'n Coke 2003 and 2007 were harshly criticised by fans as a result of participating in such a capitalist funded organization. During 2007 performance the duet with Teoman was also disapproved by fans, although this was considered as a comeback effort by Teoman. Rashit generally did not address these criticism publicly. The band released an EP on Valentine's Day 2010 named Dinozor. Also recorded a duet with G√∂n√ºl Yazar on a Sezen Aksu song, Kibir. Most recently another duet with Nil√ºfer Yumlu was performed in 2011 for the song Uzak Dur Ate≈üimden. Rashit launched a fourth album, Insan Neslinin Sonu in 2013 through Ada M√ºzik.

The dialect of Extremadura belongs to the southern dialects of Spanish, with strong similarities to the speech from Andalusia or Murcian. However, in northern Extremadura these southern features merge with some Leonese features, forming the Extremaduran language, which is nowadays seriously endangered. In the rest of the territory, the influence of Leonese on the language is marginal. There are some towns or villages in Extremadura where Portuguese is spoken, such as Olivenza, Cedillo and Herrera de Alc√°ntara. Olivenza and Cedillo belonged to Portugal until two centuries ago, but Herrera de Alc√°ntara never did. In three villages located in a small valley of the northwestern part of Extremadura near the border with Portugal, the Fala language is spoken, which is a Romance language from the Galician- Portuguese subgroup mixed with Extremaduran. Historically, Extremadura has long been one of the poorest regions in the country.

Diogo was the eldest son of John, Lord of Reguengos de Monsaraz, Infante of Portugal, and of his wife (and niece) Isabella of Barcelos. Through his father, Diogo was the grandson of King John I of Portugal and through his mother, the grandson of Afonso of Barcelos (future first duke of Braganza). John of Reguengos had been the master of the Order of Santiago since 1418 and Constable of Portugal since 1431. Upon John's premature death in October 1442, the Portuguese regent, Peter of Coimbra decided to appoint John's son Diogo as the new Constable of Portugal. Diogo was elected on 24 January 1443, as 11th Master of the Order of Santiago. Diogo died a few days later, without issue. Peter appointed his own son, also named Peter, to succeed him as constable. These appointments were contested by Diogo's half-uncle (and grandfather), Afonso, Count of Barcelos. Afonso had married the daughter of the late beatified constable Nuno √Ålvares Pereira, and believed their son, Afonso of Ourem, had superior rights to succeed as Constable of Portugal. Peter of Coimbra challenged Barcelos and Ourem to provide documentary proof of the legitimacy of this lineage (which they were unable to produce). Peter of Coimbra attempted to mollify them by creating the title of Duke of Braganza, and investing it in Afonso of Barcelos. However, this failed to heal the breach between Peter and Afonso, which would only grow with time.

In addition to these appearances, as well as several magazine and internet radio interviews between 2006 and 2008, she had been referred to by at least one sportswriter as \\"the hottest female free agent in pro wrestling\\". She is also an accomplished professional model having appeared in Axis Magazine, Bayou Vixen Magazine, Choice Magazine, Fitness Model Magazine, FHM, Hellions Magazine, Hollywood Model Magazine, Indy Circuit Pulse, Maverick Illustrated, Model Vanity Magazine, Naked Paper 7, Piledriver Magazine, Pro Wrestling Illustrated, Real Gainz Fitness Magazine, VBlazin Magazine, Wrestling Time Magazine and Zoo Weekly.

Lauderdale, Florida. She often watched televised wrestling matches with her grandfather and eventually became interested in professional wrestling as a child. Among her favorite wrestlers growing up were Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, The Undertaker, Bret \\"the Hitman\\" Hart and \\"The Heartbreak Kid\\" Shawn Michaels. It was while following the series of matches between Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit that she considered a career in professional wrestling. and she began calling up promotions in her area. After her first meeting with a local promoter, he agreed to use her on his next show. Much of her early experience was spent working as a ring girl and as part of the ring crew. Around 2002, Elizabeth was modeling in a local fashion show with another wrestler, \\"Showtime\\" JB Cool. It was Cool that gave Elizabeth her initial training, later followed by Jimmy Snuka and Soulman Alex G, prior to making her debut. Her in-ring debut was a battle royal but she later had her first wrestling match against Angel. She used various ringnames during her early career, most often Shawna or CJ Vyper, prior to using Vyper as her regular ringname. The name originated from a childhood nickname Elizabeth's mother used for her. During the next three years, she spent time in both the Florida and California \\"indy circuit\\" as well as balancing a modeling career. She modeled for a number of magazines including Axis Magazine, Bayou Vixen Magazine, Fitness Model Magazine, FHM, Hellions Magazine, Hollywood Model Magazine, Indy Circuit Pulse, Model Vanity Magazine, Naked Paper 7, Piledriver Magazine, Pro Wrestling Illustrated, Real Gainz Fitness Magazine, VBlazin Magazine, Wrestling Time Magazine and Zoo Weekly.

Elizabeth has credited many of these wrestlers, most especially the Dudley Boys, for helping her during her early career. On May 3, 2007, she made a second appearance on \\"Masked Maniac Show\\" in which she discussed her modeling career, including an offer from Maxim, and upcoming managerial debut in UXW Pro Wrestling.

Hatfield on \\"The Wrestling Hotseat\\" radio show where she discussed her past and current career as well as explaining the merchandising process from her newly created website.

However, it was not situated in a populated area and, from 1921, it was used as a convalescent home for children and a training school for nursery nurses. It was occupied by children who needed long-term treatment with illness such as rickets, tuberculosis, and malnutrition. A school for the children was opened in 1923. The Hospital was overseen by Catherine Cummins or Mother Polycarp. Building work, up to the mid-1950s, increased the number of beds and cots from 60 to 260, and new operating suite, X-ray department, and a physiotherapy department were added. From the mid-1950s fewer children were admitted following the discoveries of newer medical treatments and the number of beds was reduced to 164, and more beds were used for adults. From 1961 building modifications equipped the hospital to perform orthopaedic operations.

His most noticeable activity came early in his career as a midshipman aboard HMS Speedy, which was then captained by his brother, Commander Thomas Cochrane (known as Lord Cochrane). Aboard Speedy, Cochrane participated in the engagement and capture of the Spanish frigate Gamo, which was more than three times the size of the British ship. Although captured by the French shortly afterwards, Cochrane's career continued successfully and he was promoted to lieutenant in 1804, sailing to the East Indies on HMS Victor and rapidly gaining promotion to post captain in the frigate HMS Fox. In 1811, Cochrane returned to Europe and did not serve again, retiring to Sunderland and dying in 1829. Life Archibald Cochrane was born in 1783, the son of Archibald Cochrane, 9th Earl of Dundonald and his first wife Anna Gilchrist. Archibald had two elder brothers, Thomas Cochrane and William Erskine Cochrane, both of whom would have successful military careers, Thomas in the Royal Navy and William in the British Army.Captain Hon. Archibald Cochrane, peerage.com, Daryl Lundy, Retrieved 1 October 2009 Sent to sea at a young age, by 1799 Archibald was serving alongside Thomas, styled Lord Cochrane, as a midshipman in the ship of the line HMS Barfleur, flagship of Lord Keith in the Mediterranean. Following the capture of the French ship of the line Genereux in February 1800, Lord Cochrane was placed in temporary command of the prize and took his younger brother aboard as part of the prize crew. The ship passed through a severe storm on the voyage to Port Mahon, and was almost sunk, the Cochrane brothers forced to climb the mainmast alone at the height of the storm to reef the sails. For his exertions, Lord Cochrane was promoted to commander and given command of the 14-gun sloop HMS Speedy, again taking his brother aboard. Archibald Cochrane was involved in most of his brother's successful operations during the following year, including the capture of the Spanish frigate Gamo on 6 May 1801. Attacked by the much larger warship, Cochrane took his tiny vessel alongside, and the Spanish sailors could not depress their guns sufficiently to open fire on it. Leading a boarding party, Archibald assisted in the fighting on deck and the successful capture of the ship. He later participated in a landing operation at Oropesa del Mar, but was captured when Speedy was seized by a French squadron under Charles Linois on 3 July 1801.The Gentleman's Magazine, July 1837, p. 173 In 1804, during the Napoleonic Wars, Cochrane was promoted to lieutenant, sailing for the East Indies in the sloop HMS Victor. Rapidly promoted, by 1807 he was post captain in command of the frigate HMS Fox and participated in the Raid on Griessie against the Dutch port of Griessie on Java in December. Cochrane remained in the East Indies until 1811, when he returned to Britain and was not employed at sea again. He married in 1812 to Jane Mowbray and had six children, the family retiring to Sunderland, where he was respected in the community. He died in 1829 in Paris.

Life Tatra T77 maquette by Paul Jaray, 1934 Jaray, of Hungarian-Jewish descent, was born in Vienna. Jaray studied at Maschinenbauschule in Vienna and worked at the Prague Technical University as an assistant to Professor Rudolf D√∂rfl. Later he became the chief design engineer for the aircraft building firm Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen, designing seaplanes. From 1914 Jaray worked at Luftschiffbau Zeppelin, located in the same town, concentrating on streamlining airships. Jaray designed the airship LZ 120 Bodensee on which airships such as the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, the LZ 129 Hindenburg and the LZ-130 were later based. Further experiments in LZ's wind tunnel led to his establishment of streamlining principles for car designs. In 1923 he moved permanently to Switzerland, opening an office in Brunnen. In 1927, Jaray founded the Stromlinien Karosserie Gesellschaft, which presented numerous designs for streamlined car body work. It issued licences to major vehicle manufacturers including Tatra Works in Kop≈ôivnice, Czechoslovakia. Tatra was the only manufacturer that used Jaray's streamlining principles for their car production. Jaray designed his own cars starting with the 1923 Ley and followed on with designs for Chrysler, Mercedes-Benz, Maybach, Apollo, Dixi, Audi, Adler, Jawa, Ford, Steyr and others. His own 1933 car was built on a Mercedes-Benz chassis with a body by Huber and Bruehwiler of Lucerne. Jaray was also interested in radio and television technology. In 1941 he worked for Farner AG in Grenchen on nosewheel undercarriage design. In 1944 he set up as an independent engineer working on wind-driven power station. He was the author of a large number of technical patents relating to streamlining, air compressors for railway, and devices for handling gases in silencers. Later he lectured at the Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), Zurich. Jaray died in 1974 in St. Gallen.

Physics  The paddle wheel is a device for converting between rotary motion of a shaft and linear motion of a fluid. In the linear-to-rotary direction, it is placed in a fluid stream to convert the linear motion of the fluid into rotation of the wheel. This rotation can be used as a source of power, or as an indication of the speed of flow. In the rotary-to-linear direction, it is driven by a prime mover such as an electric motor or steam engine and used to pump a fluid or propel a vehicle such as a paddle-wheel steamer or a steamship.

It is a Pirate Party which is based on the Pirate Party of Sweden, and has continued to develop a comprehensive policy platform since its formation based on the Pirate ethos. History The Pirate Party was founded in 2008 by Rodney Serkowski with the launch of a website and a wiki, and a request for contributions. In 2009, the first National Council of the Party was elected. Pirate Party Australia was formally registered as a political party by the Australian Electoral Commission on 17 January 2013. In late 2009, the party announced its intention to contest the 2010 federal election and recruited the 500 members necessary for registration. The party was expected to mainly compete with the Australian Greens and the Reason Party. Due to registration requirements, the party was not able to contest the 2010 federal election but it registered in January 2013, enabling it to contest the 2013 federal election. Platform and policy The Pirate Party's platform is developed collaboratively and democratically, and hosted on a wiki on the Party's website. All policies are required to meet the principles and objectives as set out in the Party's constitution and be supported by a two- thirds majority vote of all full members of the Pirate Party at a relevant meeting. Policies will also only be adopted after the completion of an online seven-day voting period, where all full members may take part. When founded in 2009, the Pirate Party's platform started off limited to a series of core policies: civil and digital liberties (opposition to internet censorship), government transparency, personal privacy, and copyright and patent reform. By 2013, the platform and policies of the Pirate Party have expanded significantly into a comprehensive policy set that competes with the major parties and larger minor parties in detail and breadth. Most policy is adopted and debated at a National Congress, which meets annually in July. The meeting is hosted physically, but also simultaneously broadcast live via a web stream with interaction tools, allowing participation for all members and the public regardless of physical proximity from the meeting. Another type of conference called a Policy Meeting can also be hosted specifically for the adoption and debate of policy and platform amendments, which did happen once in April 2013. In July 2012, the platform saw a very minor revision, introducing protection of quotation rights, unrestricted format shifting, policy specifically geared towards supporting 3D printing, mandatory privacy breach disclosure, protection for whistleblowers, political donations and transparency treaty making. Since 2013, the Party set off to rapidly expand its platform and policy set, expanding into more traditional areas of political discourse such as education, the environment, energy, welfare, taxation and asylum seeker policy. In April 2013, a Policy Meeting was hosted in order to deliberate on significant amendments to the platform and policy set. For the first time in the Pirate Party's history, the meeting resolved to introduce platform amendments outside traditional Pirate political areas and introduce detailed policy texts to complement the platform, including: clean energy, a moratorium on coal seam gas extraction, taxation reform, welfare reform, drug reform, marriage reform, the introduction of a bill of rights, and improving the electoral process. The National Congress in July 2013 saw the introduction of further policies, including: civil liberties, cultural participation, education, democratic institution reform, animal welfare, asylum seekers and refugees and foreign policy and treaty making. The welfare policy was updated to include support for the NDIS and other minor changes. 2014 saw fewer amendments than the overhauls of the previous years, introducing policy amendments relating to constitutional reform, copyright, education, energy, the environment and climate change, privacy law, and tax and welfare. In February 2015, Pirate Party Australia resigned from Pirate Parties International due to serious disagreement with the direction and management of the organisation. In the same month, Pirate Party UK also resigned and in March the Belgian Pirate Party suspended its membership within PPI. The Pirate Party has a strong focus on evidence-based policy development, listing just under 200 references on their platform as of July 2015. Euthanasia At the request of Exit International, Pirate Party Australia member David Campbell conducted a series of information sessions as part of Exit International's workshop for seniors who wanted to know how to by-pass the Australian Internet Filter so that they can access information on safe euthanasia techniques. Pirate Party Australia has adopted Euthanasia rights into their party policy platform. Elections= Australian Capital Territory General Election, 2012  In 2012, members of the Pirate Party's ACT branch ran as independent candidates in the Australian Capital Territory elections. The Pirate Party endorsed three ungrouped candidates in the election, each of whom received 0.4-0.5% of the primary vote.  Australian Federal Election, 2013  The Pirate Party was approached by Glenn Druery to be a member of the Minor Party Alliance, but chose to eschew membership of the alliance due to the membership requirement of preferencing far right parties highly, and instead chose to base preferences upon a democratic vote of its members along policy lines.Preferencing Statement for Federal Election 2013 Democratically deciding their Senate preferences is now standard practice for Pirate Party Australia. It did so in the 2014 Western Australia Senate Rerun.Preferencing Statement for WA Senate Election 2014 Pirate Party Australia ran eight candidates for the Senate in the 2013 Federal Election: two candidates each in the states of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania. The best result was in Tasmania with a 0.6% primary vote. The party was unique in its approach to preference deals with other parties in that they are professing to eschew the secret deals that typify preference negotiations and instead are conducting all such activities openly and transparently and putting all decisions to a membership vote.  Griffith by-election, 2014  Melanie Thomas ran for the Pirate Party at the 2014 Griffith by-election and finished fourth out of 11 candidates with a 1.5% primary vote.  WA Senate Special Election, 2014  In the 2013 Senate election, Pirate Party Australia did not run candidates in WA. However, due to certain issues with the results of that election, there was a special WA rerun election, where the party did run two candidates. The party preferenced Scott Ludlam of the Australian Greens as their next highest preference. Pirate Party Australia ran two candidates on the Pirate Party ticket in the special election: Fletcher Boyd and Michelle Allen. Pirate Party Australia received 0.49%AEC Virtual Tally Room - First Preference by Group - WA of the first preference group ticket votes.  Canning by-election, 2015  Michelle Allen contested the 2015 Canning by-election as the Pirate Party candidate and won 775 first preference votes or 0.92% of the total. 2016 federal election In the 2016 federal election Pirate Party Australia fielded two senate candidates in each of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, and a candidate for the House of Representatives in the Division of Bennelong.

Life He was the third son of Sir John Croke, and was admitted student of Christ Church, Oxford, on 5 January 1604. He proceeded B.A. (1608), M.A.(1611), B.D. and D.D. (1625). He was tutor of his college, and held the professorship of rhetoric at Gresham College, London, from 1613 to 1619. He was junior proctor (1613), and fellow of Eton College (1617‚Äì1621). He became rector of Waterstock, Oxfordshire, on the presentation of his uncle, Sir George Croke, on 24 June 1616, and rector of Agmondisham, Buckinghamshire, in 1621. He took private pupils at Agmondisham, and among them were Sir William Drake, Sir Robert Croke, John Gregory, and Henry Curwen, son of Sir Patricius Curwen.

Like its predecessor, it was a low wing, four engine monoplane carrying 12 passengers. Only one was built, serving with the French Air Ministry. Design and development In 1936 the well established Potez company became part of the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Constructions A√©ronautique du Nord (S.N.C.A.N.), under the Law for the Nationalisation of Military Industries. They followed up their first four engined aircraft, the type 661 of 1937 with the Type 662, almost identical apart from having much more powerful engines In place of the 220 hp (164 kW) Renault 6-Q inverted inline engines off the 661, the 662 had 680 hp (507 kW) Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14M Mars radials and consequentially much improved performance. The 662 wasFlight 1 December 1938 p.305 The Potez 662 at the Paris Show a commercial machine with seating for up to twelve passengers. It was a low wing cantilever, almost all-metal monoplane. The wing tapered with a nearly straight trailing edge that carried outboard balanced ailerons and split trailing edge flaps over the whole of the centre section. The four Mars small diameter (950 mm or 3 ft 1¬Ω in) 14-cylinder radials were conventionally mounted of the front wing spar, neatly enclosed with wide chord cowlings and large spinners. These drove three bladed variable propellers.. Internally the wing was strengthened to accommodate the greater power and the fuel tank capacity was increased by 37% to provide for the higher consumption. The fuselage was a metal monocoque, with a port side passenger door aft of six windowsFlight 30 September 1943 p.436 on each side, one per seat. Though the standard seat arrangement was for twelve, two seats could be removed to allow the installation of chaises-longues for longer flights. The pilots' cabin was enclosed, with side by side dual control seating. The tail unit carried twin vertical endplate fins, slightly oval on a tailplane that had strong dihedral. The balanced rudders and elevators were metal structures with the only fabric covering used on the aircraft. The elevators carried trim tabs. There was a small tailwheel, the main undercarriage retracting into the inner engine nacelles. The Potez 662 made its first flight on 26 July 1938 at Meaulte, flown by M. Labouchere who was S.C.A.N.'s chief test pilot.Flight 11 August 1938 p.128Flight 24 April 1939 p.436 It made an impression at the 1938 Paris Aero Show, not least because it was the only real (as opposed to mock-ups and models) new commercial aircraft present. Despite its evidently civilian presentation, one contemporary report has it called the Potez 662 bomber;Flight supplement 29 December 1938 p.606b there is no evidence that such a conversion was ever considered. Though the one 662 completed before the war was originally intended for Air France, with the expectation of orders to come, it was taken over by the French Air Ministry for its own use. It is probable that no more were built, despite speculative suggestions in Flight that it might be produced in occupied France for German use.
